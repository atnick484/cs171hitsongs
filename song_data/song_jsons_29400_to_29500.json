She wanted to find out where Richard Wharfinger had got his information about Trystero. Possibly also take a look at how the inventor John Nefastis picked up his mail.\n\nAs with Mucho when she'd left Kinneret, Metzger did not seem desperate at her going. She debated, driving north, whether to stop off at home on the way to Berkeley or coming back. As it turned out she missed the exit for Kinneret and that solved it. She purred along up the east side of the bay, presently climbed into the Berkeley hills and arrived close to midnight at a sprawling, many-leveled, German-baroque hotel, carpeted in deep green, going in for curved corridors and ornamental chandeliers. A sign in the lobby said WELCOME CALIFORNIA CHAPTER AMERICAN DEAF-MUTE ASSEMBLY. Every light in the place burned, alarmingly bright; a truly ponderable silence occupied the building. A clerk popped up from behind the desk where he'd been sleeping and began making sign language at her. Oedipa considered giving him the finger to see what would happen. But she'd driven straight through, and all at once the fatigue of it had caught up with her. The clerk took her to a room with a reproduction of a Remedios Varo in it, through corridors gently curving as the streets of San Francisco, utterly silent. She fell asleep almost at once, but kept waking from a nightmare about something in the mirror, across from her bed.\n\nNothing specific, only a possibility, nothing she could see. When she finally did settle into sleep, she dreamed that Mucho, her husband, was making love to her on a soft white beach that was not part of any California she knew. When she woke in the morning, she was sitting bolt upright, staring into the mirror at her own exhausted face. She found the Lectern Press in a small office building on Shattuck Avenue. They didn't have Plays of Ford, Webster, Tourneur and Wharfinger on the premises, but did take her check for $12.50, gave her the address of their warehouse in Oakland and a receipt to show the people there. By the time she'd collected the book, it was afternoon. She skimmed through to find the line that had brought her all the way up here. And in the leaf-fractured sunlight, froze.\n\nNo hallowed skein of stars can ward, I trow, ran the couplet, Who once has crossed the lusts of Angela. \"No,\" she protested aloud. \" 'Who's once been set his tryst with Trystero.'\" The pencilled note in the paperback had mentioned a variant. But the paperback was supposed to be a straight reprint of the book she now held. Puzzled, she saw that this edition also had a footnote: According only to the Quarto edition (1687). The earlier Folio has a lead inserted where the closing line should have been. D'Amico has suggested that Wharfinger may have made a libellous comparison involving someone at court, and that the later 'restoration' was actually the work of the printer, Inigo Barfstable. The doubtful 'Whitechapel' version (c. 1670) has This tryst or odious awry, O Niccolo,' which besides bringing in a quite graceless Alexandrine, is difficult to make sense of syntactically, unless we accept the rather unorthodox though persuasive argument of J.-K. Sale that the line is really a pun on 'This trystero dies irae . . . .' This, however, it must be pointed out, leaves the line nearly as corrupt as before, owing to no clear meaning for the word trystero, unless it be a pseudo-Italianate variant on triste (= wretched, depraved). But the 'White-chapel' edition, besides being a fragment, abounds in such corrupt and probably spurious lines, as we have mentioned elsewhere, and is hardly to be trusted.\n\nThen where, Oedipa wondered, does the paperback I bought at Zapf's get off with its \"Trystero\" line? Was there yet another edition, besides the Quarto, Folio, and \"Whitechapel\" fragment? The editor's preface, signed this time, by one Emory Bortz, professor of English at Cal, mentioned none. She spent nearly an hour more, searching through all the footnotes, finding nothing.\n\"Dammit,\" she yelled, started the car and headed for the Berkeley campus, to find Professor Bortz. She should have remembered the date on the book 1957. Another world. The girl in the English office informed Oedipa that Professor Bortz was no longer with the faculty. He was teaching at San Francisco College, San Francisco, California.\nOf course, Odeipa thought, wry, where else? She copied the address and walked away trying to remember who'd put out the paperback. She couldn't. It was summer, a weekday, and midafternoon; no time for any campus Oedipa knew of to be jumping, yet this one was. She came downslope from Wheeler Hall, through Sather Gate into a plaza teeming with corduroy, denim, bare legs, blonde hair, horn rims, bicycle spokes in the sun, book bags, swaying card tables, long paper petitions dangling to earth, posters for undecipherable FSM's, YAF's, VDC's, suds in the fountain, students in nose-to-nose dialogue. She moved through it carrying her fat book, attracted, unsure, a stranger, wanting to feel relevant but knowing how much of a search among alternate universes it would take. For she had undergone her own educating at a time of nerves, blandness and retreat among not only her fellow students but also most of the visible structure around and ahead of them, this having been a national reflex to certain pathologies in high places only death had had the power to cure, and this Berkeley was like no somnolent Siwash out of her own past at all, but more akin to those Far Eastern or Latin American universities you read about, those autonomous culture media where the most beloved of folklores may be brought into doubt, cataclysmic of dissents voiced, suicidal of commitments chosen the sort that bring governments down.\n\nBut it was English she was hearing as she crossed Bancroft Way among the blonde children and the muttering Hondas and Su-zukis; American English. Where were Secretaries James and Foster and Senator Joseph, those dear daft numina who'd mothered over Oedipa's so temperate youth? In another world. Along another pattern of track, another string of decisions taken, switches closed, the faceless points men who'd thrown them now all transferred, deserted, in stir, fleeing the skip-tracers, out of their skull, on horse, alcoholic, fanatic, under aliases, dead, impossible to find ever again. Among them they had managed to turn the young Oedipa into a rare creature indeed, unfit perhaps for marches and sit-ins, but just a whiz at pursuing strange words in Jacobean texts.\nShe pulled the Impala into a gas station somewhere along a gray stretch of Telegraph Avenue and found in a phone book the address of John Nefastis. She then drove to a pseudo-Mexican apartment house, looked for his name among the U. S. mailboxes, ascended outside steps and walked down a row of draped windows till she found his door. He had a crew-cut and the same underage look as Koteks, but wore a shirt on various Polynesian themes and dating from the Truman administration.\n\nIntroducing herself, she invoked the name of Stanley Koteks. \"He said you could tell me whether or not I'm a 'sensitive'.\"Nefastis had been watching on his TV set a bunch of kids dancing some kind of a Watusi. \"I like to watch young stuff,\" he explained. \"There's something about a little chick that age.\"\n\"So does my husband,\" she said. \"I understand.\"John Nefastis beamed at her, simpatico, and brought out his Machine from a workroom in back. It looked about the way the patent had described it. \"You know how this works?\" \"Stanley gave me a kind of rundown.\" He began then, bewilderingly, to talk about something called entropy. The word bothered him as much as \"Trystero\" bothered Oedipa. But it was too technical for her. She did gather that there were two distinct kinds of this entropy. One having to do with heat-engines, the other to do with communication. The equation for one, back in the '3o's, had looked very like the equation for the other. It was a coincidence. The two fields were entirely unconnected, except at one point: Maxwell's Demon. As the Demon sat and sorted his molecules into hot and cold, the system was said to lose entropy. But somehow the loss was offset by the information the Demon gained about what molecules were where.\n\n\"Communication is the key,\" cried Nefastis. \"The Demon passes his data on to the sensitive, and the sensitive must reply in kind. There are untold billions of molecules in that box. The Demon collects data on each and every one. At some deep psychic level he must get through. The sensitive must receive that staggering set of energies, and feedback something like the same quantity of information. To keep it all cycling. On the secular level all we can see is one piston, hopefully moving. One little movement, against all that massive complex of information, destroyed over and over with each power stroke.\"\n\"Help,\" said Oedipa, \"you're not reaching me.\"\n\n\"Entropy is a figure of speech, then,\" sighed Nefastis, \"a metaphor. It connects the world of thermo-dynamics to the world of information flow. The Machine uses both. The Demon makes the metaphor not only verbally graceful, but also objectively true.\"\n\n\"But what,\" she felt like some kind of a heretic, \"if the Demon exists only because the two equations look alike? Because of the metaphor?\"\nNefastis smiled; impenetrable, calm, a believer. \"He existed for Clerk Maxwell long before the days of the metaphor.\"\n\nBut had Clerk Maxwell been such a fanatic about his Demon's reality? She looked at the picture on the outside of the box. Clerk Maxwell was in profile and would not meet her eyes. The forehead was round and smooth, and there was a curious bump at the back of his head, covered by curling hair. His visible eye seemed mild and noncommittal, but Oedipa wondered what hangups, crises, spookings in the middle of the night might be developed from the shadowed subtleties of his mouth, hidden under a full beard.\n\n\"Watch the picture,\" said Nefastis, \"and concentrate on a cylinder. Don't worry. If you're a sensitive you'll know which one. Leave your mind open, receptive to the Demon's message. I'll be back.\" He returned to his TV set, which was now showing cartoons. Oedipa sat through two Yogi Bears, one Magilla Gorilla and a Peter Potamus, staring at Clerk Maxwell's enigmatic profile, waiting for the Demon to communicate.\n\nAre you there, little fellow, Oedipa asked the Demon, or is Nefastis putting me on. Unless a piston moved, she'd never know. Clerk Maxwell's hands were cropped out of the photograph. He might have been holding a book. He gazed away, into some vista of Victorian England whose light had been lost forever. Oedipa's anxiety grew. It seemed, behind the beard, he'd begun, ever so faintly, to smile. Something in his eyes, certainly, had changed.\n\nAnd there. At the top edge of what she could see: hadn't the right-hand piston moved, a fraction? She couldn't look directly, the instructions were to keep her eyes on Clerk Maxwell. Minutes passed, pistons remained frozen in place. High-pitched, comic voices issued from the TV set. She had seen only a retinal twitch, a misfired nerve cell. Did the true sensitive see more? In her colon now she was afraid, growing more so, that nothing would happen. Why worry, she worried; Nefastis is a nut, forget it, a sincere nut. The true sensitive is the one that can share in the man's hallucinations, that's all.\n\nHow wonderful they might be to share. For fifteen minutes more she tried; repeating, if you are there, whatever you are, show yourself to me, I need you, show yourself. But nothing happened.\n\"I'm sorry,\" she called in, surprisingly about to cry with frustration, her voice breaking, \"It's no use.\" Nefastis came to her and put an arm around her shoulders. \"It's OK,\" he said. \"Please don't cry. Come on in on the couch. The news will be on any minute. We can do it there.\"\"It?\" said Oedipa. \"Do it? What?\"\"Have sexual intercourse,\" replied Nefastis. \"Maybe there'll be something about China tonight. I like to do it while they talk about Viet Nam, but China is best of all. You think about all those Chinese. Teeming. That profusion of life. It makes it sexier, right?\"\"Gah,\" Oedipa screamed, and fled, Nefastis snapping his fingers through the dark rooms behind her in a hippy-dippy, oh-go-ahead-then-chick fashion he had doubtless learned from watching the TV also.\n\"Say hello to old Stanley,\" he called as she pattered down the steps into the street, flung a babushka over her license plate and screeched away down Telegraph. She drove more or less automatically until a swift boy in a Mustang, perhaps unable to contain the new sense of virility his auto gave him, nearly killed her and she realized that she was on the freeway, heading irreversibly for the Bay Bridge. It was the middle of rush hour. Oedipa was appalled at the spectacle, having thought such traffic only possible in Los Angeles, places like that. Looking down at San Francisco a few minutes later from the high point of the bridge's arc, she saw smog.\n\nHaze, she corrected herself, is what it is, haze. How can they have smog in San Francisco? Smog, according to the folklore, did not begin till farther south. It had to be the angle of the sun. Amid the exhaust, sweat, glare and ill-humor of a summer evening on an American freeway, Oedipa Maas pondered her Trystero problem. All the silence of San Francisco,the calm surface of the motel pool, the contemplative contours of residential streets like rakings in the sand of a Japanese garden had not allowed her to think as leisurely as this freeway madness. For John Nefastis (to take a recent example) two kinds of entropy, thermodynamic and informational, happened, say by coincidence, to look alike, when you wrote them down as equations. Yet he had made his mere coincidence respectable, with the help of Maxwell's Demon. Now here was Oedipa, faced with a metaphor of God knew how many parts; more than two, anyway.\n\nWith coincidences blossoming these days wherever she looked, she had nothing but a sound, a word, Trystero, a to hold them together. She knew a few things about it: it had opposed the Thurn and Taxis postal system in Europe; its symbol was a muted post horn; sometime before 1853 it had appeared in America and fought the Pony Express and Wells, Fargo, either as outlaws in black, or disguised as Indians; and it survived today, in California, serving as a channel of communication for those of unorthodox sexual persuasion, inventors who believed in the reality of Maxwell's Demon, possibly her own husband, Mucho Maas (but she'd thrown Mucho's letter long away, there was no way for Genghis Cohen to check the stamp, so if she wanted to find out for sure she'd have to ask Mucho himself).\n\nEither Trystero did exist, in its own right, or it was being presumed, perhaps fantasied by Oedipa, so hung up on and interpenetrated with the dead man's estate. Here in San Francisco, away from all tangible assets of that estate, there might still be a chance of getting the whole thing to go away and disintegrate quietly. She had only to drift tonight, at random, and watch nothing happen, to be convinced it was purely nervous, a little something for her shrink to fix. She got off the freeway at North Beach, drove around, parked finally in a steep side-street among warehouses. Then walked along Broadway, into the first crowds of evening.\n\nBut it took her no more than an hour to catch sight of a muted post horn. She was moseying along a street full of aging boys in Roos Atkins suits when she collided with a gang of guided tourists come rowdy-dowing out of a Volkswagen bus, on route to take in a few San Francisco nite spots. \"Let me lay this on you,\" a voice spoke into her ear, \"because I just left,\" and she found being deftly pinned outboard of one breast this big cerise ID badge, reading Hi! MY NAME Is Arnold Snarb! AND I'M LOOKIN' FOR A GOOD TIME! Oedipa glanced around and saw a cherubic face vanishing with a wink in among natural shoulders and striped shirts, and away went Arnold Snarb, looking for a better time.\nSomebody blew on an athletic whistle and Oedipa found herself being herded, along with other badged citizens, toward a bar called The Greek Way. Oh, no, Oedipa thought, not a fag joint, no; and for a minute tried to fight out of the human surge, before recalling how she had decided to drift tonight.\n\"Now in here,\" their guide, sweating dark tentacles into his tab collar, briefed them, \"you are going to see the members of the third sex, the lavender crowd this city by the Bay is so justly famous for. To some of you the experience may seem a little queer, but remember, try not to act like a bunch of tourists. If you get propositioned it'll all be in fun, just part of the gay night life to be found here in famous North Beach. Two drinks and when you hear the whistle it means out, on the double, regroup right here. If you're well behaved we'll hit Finocchio's next.\"\n\nHe blew the whistle twice and the tourists, breaking into a yell, swept Oedipa inside, in a frenzied assault on the bar. When things had calmed she was near the door with an unidentifiable drink in her fist, jammed against somebody tall in a suede sport coat. In the lapel of which she spied, wrought exquisitely in some pale, glimmering alloy, not another cerise badge, but a pin in the shape of the Trystero post horn. Mute and everything.\n\nAll right, she told herself. You lose. A game try, all one hour's worth. She should have left then and gone back to Berkeley, to the hotel. But couldn't.\n\"What if I told you,\" she addressed the owner of the pin, \"that I was an agent of Thurn and Taxis?\"\n\n\"What,\" he answered, \"some theatrical agency?\" He had large ears, hair cropped nearly to his scalp, acne on his face, and curiously empty eyes, which now swiveled briefly to Oedipa's breasts. \"How'd you get a name like Arnold Snarb?\"\n\"If you tell me where you got your lapel pin,\" said Oedipa.\"Sorry.\"\n\nShe sought to bug him: \"If it's a homosexual sign or something, that doesn't bother me.\"Eyes showing nothing: \"I don't swing that way,\" he said. \"Yours either.\" Turned his back on her and ordered a drink. Oedipa took off her badge, put it in an ashtray and said, quietly, trying not to suggest hysteria, \"Look, you have to help me. Because I really think I am going out of my head.\"\n\"You have the wrong outfit, Arnold. Talk to your clergyman.\"\n\n\"I use the U. S. Mail because I was never taught any different,\" she pleaded. \"But I'm not your enemy. I don't want to be.\" \"What about my friend?\" He came spinning around on the stool to face her again. \"You want to be that, Arnold?\" \"I don't know,\" she thought she'd better say. He looked at her, blank. \"What do you know?\" She told him everything. Why not? Held nothing back. At the end of it the tourists had been whistled away and he'd bought two rounds to Oedipa's three. \"I'd heard about 'Kirby,'\" he said, \"it's a code name, nobody real. But none of the rest, your Sinophile across the bay, or that sick play. I never thought there was a history to it.\"\"I think of nothing but,\" she said, and a little plaintive.\"And,\" scratching the stubble on his head, \"you have nobody else to tell this to. Only somebody in a bar whose name you don't know?\"\nShe wouldn't look at him. \"I guess not.\" \"No husband, no shrink?\" \"Both,\" Oedipa said, \"but they don't know.\"\"You can't tell them?\" She met his eyes' void for a second after all, and shrugged. \"I'll tell you what I know, then,\" he decided. \"The pin I'm wearing means I'm a member of the IA. That's Inamorati Anonymous. An inamorato is somebody in love. That's the worst addiction of all.\"\n\"Somebody is about to fall in love,\" Oedipa said, \"you go sit with them, or something?\" \"Right. The whole idea is to get to where you don't need it. I was lucky. I kicked it young. But there aresixty-year-old men, believe it or not, and women even older, who wake up in the night screaming.\" \"You hold meetings, then, like the AA?\" \"No, of course not. You get a phone number, an answering service you can call. Nobody knows anybody else's name; just the number in case it gets so bad you can't handle it alone. We're isolates, Arnold. Meetings would destroy the whole point of it.\" \"What about the person who comes to sit with you? Suppose you fall in love with them?\"\n\n\"They go away,\" he said. \"You never see them twice. The answering service dispatches them, and they're careful not to have any repeats.\"How did the post horn come in? That went back to their founding. In the early '6o's a Yoyodyne executive living near L.A. and located someplace in the corporate root-system above supervisor but below vice-president, found himself, at age 39, automated out of a job. Having been since age 7 rigidly instructed in an eschatology that pointed nowhere but to a presidency and death, trained to do absolutely nothing but sign his name to specialized memoranda he could not begin to understand and to take blame for the running-amok of specialized programs that failed for specialized reasons he had to have explained to him, the executive's first thoughts were naturally of suicide. But previous training got the better of him: he could not make the decision without first hearing the ideas of a committee. He placed an ad in the personal column of the L.A.\n\nTimes, asking whether anyone who'd been in the same fix had ever found any good reasons for not committing suicide. His shrewd assumption being that no suicides would reply, leaving him automatically with only valid inputs. The assumption was false. After a week of anxiously watching the mailbox through little Japanese binoculars his wife had given him for a going-away present (she'd left him the day after he was pink-slipped) and getting nothing but sucker-list stuff through the regular deliveries that came each noon, he was jolted out of a boozy, black-and-white dream of jumping off The Stack into rush-hour traffic, by an insistent banging at the door. It was late on a Sunday afternoon. He opened his door and found an aged bum with a knitted watch cap on his head and a hook for a hand, who presented him with a bundle of letters and loped away without a word. Most of the letters were from suicides who had failed, either through clumsiness or last-minute cowardice. None of them, however, could offer any compelling reasons for staying alive.\n\nStill the executive dithered: spent another week with pieces of paper on which he would list, in columns headed \"pro\" and \"con,\" reasons for and against taking his Brody. He found it impossible, in the absence of some trigger, to come to any clear decision. Finally one day he noticed a front page story in the Times, complete with AP wire photo, about a Buddhist monk in Viet Nam who had set himself on fire to protest government policies. \"Groovy!\" cried the executive. He went to the garage, siphoned all the gasoline from his Buick's tank, put on his green Zachary All suit with the vest, stuffed all his letters from unsuccessful suicides into a coat pocket, went in the kitchen, sat on the floor, proceeded to douse himself good with the gasoline. He was about to make the farewell flick of the wheel on his faithful Zippo, which had seen him through the Norman hedgerows, the Ardennes, Germany, and postwar America, when he heard a key in the front door, and voices. It was his wife and some man, whom he soon recognized as the very efficiency expert at Yoyodyne who had caused him to be replaced by an IBM 7094.\n\nIntrigued by the irony of it, he sat in the kitchen and listened, leaving his necktie dipped in the gasoline as a sort of wick. From what he could gather, the efficiency expert wished to have sexual intercourse with the wife on the Moroccan rug in the living room. The wife was not unwilling. The executive heard lewd laughter, zippers, the thump of shoes, heavy breathing, moans. He took his tie out of the gasoline and started to snigger. He closed the top on his Zippo. \"I hear laughing,\" his wife said presently. \"I smell gasoline,\" said the efficiency expert. Hand in hand, naked, the two proceeded to the kitchen. \"I was about to do the Buddhist monk thing,\" explained the executive. \"Nearly three weeks it takes him,\" marvelled the efficiency expert, \"to decide. You know how long it would've taken the IBM 7094? Twelve microseconds. No wonder you were replaced.\" The executive threw back his head and laughed for a solid ten minutes, along toward the middle of which his wife and her friend, alarmed, retired, got dressed and went out looking for the police.\n\nThe executive undressed, showered and hung his suit out on the line to dry. Then he noticed a curious thing. The stamps on some of the letters in his suit pocket had turned almost white. He realized that the gasoline must have dissolved the printing ink. Idly, he peeled off a stamp and saw suddenly the image of the muted post horn, the skin of his hand showing clearly through the watermark. \"A sign,\" he whispered, \"is what it is.\" If he'd been a religious man he would have fallen to his knees. As it was, he only declared, with great solemnity: \"My big mistake was love. From this day I swear to stay off of love: hetero, homo, bi, dog or cat, car, every kind there is. I will found a society of isolates, dedicated to this purpose, and this sign, revealed by the same gasoline that almost destroyed me, will be its emblem.\" And he did.Oedipa, by now rather drunk, said, \"Where is he now?\"\n\n\"He's anonymous,\" said the anonymous inamorato. \"Why not write to him through your WASTE system? Say 'Founder, IA.'\" \"But I don't know how to use it,\" she said. \"Think of it,\" he went on, also drunk. \"A whole underworld of suicides who failed. All keeping in touch through that secret delivery system. What do they tell each other?\" He shook his head, smiling, stumbled off his stool and headed off to take a leak, disappearing into the dense crowd. He didn't come back.\n\nOedipa sat, feeling as alone as she ever had, now the only woman, she saw, in a room full of drunken male homosexuals. Story of my life, she thought, Mucho won't talk to me, Hilarius won't listen, Clerk Maxwell didn't even look at me, and this group, God knows. Despair came over her, as it will when nobody around has any sexual relevance to you. She gauged the spectrum of feeling out there as running from really violent hate (an Indian-looking kid hardly out of his teens, with frosted shoulder-length hair tucked behind his ears and pointed cowboy boots) to dry speculation (a horn-rimmed SS type who stared at her legs, trying to figure out if she was in drag), none of which could do her any good. So she got up after a while and left The Greek Way, and entered the city again, the infected city.\n\nAnd spent the rest of the night finding the image of the Trystero post horn. In Chinatown, in the dark window of a herbalist, she thought she saw it on a sign among ideographs. But the streetlight was dim. Later, on a sidewalk, she saw two of them in chalk, 20 feet apart. Between them a complicated array of boxes, some with letters, some with numbers. A kids' game? Places on a. map, dates from a secret history? She copied the diagram in her memo book. When she looked up, a man, perhaps a man, in a black suit, was standing in a doorway half a block away, watching her. She thought she saw a turned-around collar but took no chances; headed back the way she'd come, pulse thundering. A bus stopped at the next corner, and she ran to catch it.\n\nShe stayed with buses after that, getting off only now and then to walk so she'd keep awake. What fragments of dreams came had to do with the post horn. Later, possibly, she would have trouble sorting the night into real and dreamed.At some indefinite passage in night's sonorous score, it also came to her that she would be safe, that something, perhaps only her linearly fading drunkenness, would protect her. The city was hers, as, made up and sleeked so with the customary words and images (cosmopolitan, culture, cable cars) it had not been before: she had safe-passage tonight to its far blood's branching\u2019s, be they capillaries too small for more than peering into, or vessels mashed together in shameless municipal hickeys, out on the skin for all but tourists to see. Nothing of the nights could touch her; nothing did. The repetition of symbols was to be enough, without trauma as well perhaps to attenuate it or even jar it altogether loose from her memory.\n\nShe was meant to remember. She faced that possibility as she might the toy street from a high balcony, roller-coaster ride, feeding-time among the beasts in a zoo any death-wish that can be consummated by some minimum gesture. She touched the edge of its voluptuous field, knowing it would be lovely beyond dreams simply to submit to it; that not gravity's pull, laws of ballistics, feral ravening, promised more delight. She tested it, shivering: I am meant to remember. Each clue that comes is supposed to have its own clarity, its fine chances for permanence. But then she wondered if the gem-like \"clues\" were only some kind of compensation. To make up for her having lost the direct, epileptic Word, the cry that might abolish the night.\n\nIn Golden Gate Park she came on a circle of children in their nightclothes, who told her they were dreaming the gathering. But that the dream was really no different from being awake, because in the mornings when they got up they felt tired, as if they'd been up most of the night. When their mothers thought they were out playing they were really curled in cupboards of neighbors' houses, in platforms up in trees, in secretly-hollowed nests inside hedges, sleeping, making up for these hours. The night was empty of all terror for them, they had inside their circle an imaginary fire, and needed nothing but their own unpenetrated sense of community. They knew about the post horn, but nothing of the chalked game Oedipa had seen on the sidewalk. You used only one image and it was a jump-rope game, a little girl explained: you stepped alternately in the loop, the bell, and the mute, while your girlfriend sang:\n\nTristoe, Tristoe, one, two, three, Turning taxi from across the sea ... \"Thurn and Taxis, you mean?\" They'd never heard it that way. Went on warming their hands at an invisible fire. Oedipa, to retaliate, stopped believing in them.\nIn an all-night Mexican greasy spoon off 24th, she found a piece of her past, in the form of one Jesus Arrabal, who was sitting in a corner under the TV set, idly stirring his bowl of opaque soup with the foot of a chicken. \"Hey,\" he greeted Oedipa, \"you were the lady in Mazatlan.\" He beckoned her to sit.\n\"You remember everything,\" Oedipa said, \"Jesus; even tourists. How is your CIA?\" Standing not for the agency you think, but for a clandestine Mexican outfit known as the Conjuration de los Insurgentes Anarquis-tas, traceable back to the time of the Flores Mag6n brothers and later briefly allied with Zapata.\n\"You see. In exile,\" waving his arm around at the place. He was part-owner here with a yucateco who still believed in the Revolution. Their Revolution. \"And you. Are you still with that gringo who spent too much money on you? The oligarchist, the miracle?\" \"He died.\"\n\n\"Ah, pobrecito.\" They had met Jesus Arrabal on the beach, where he had previously announced an anti-government rally. Nobody had showed up. So he fell to talking to Inverarity, the enemy he must, to be true to his faith, learn. Pierce, because of his neutral manners when in the presence of ill-will, had nothing to tell Arrabal; he played the rich, obnoxious gringo so perfectly that Oedipa had seen gooseflesh come up along the anarchist's forearms, due to no Pacific sea-breeze. Soon as Pierce went off to sport in the surf, Arrabal asked her if he was real, or a spy, or making fun of him. Oedipa didn't understand.\n\"You know what a miracle is. Not what Bakunin said. But another world's intrusion into this one. Most of the time we coexist peacefully, but when we do touch there's cataclysm. Like the church we hate, anarchists also believe in another world. Where revolutions break out spontaneous and leaderless, and the soul's talent for consensus allows the masses to work together without effort, automatic as the body itself. And yet, sena, if any of it should ever really happen that perfectly, I would also have to cry miracle. An anarchist miracle. Like your friend. He is too exactly and without flaw the thing we fight. In Mexico the privilegiado is always, to a finite percentage, redeemed one of the people. Unmiraculous. But your friend, unless he's joking, is as terrifying to me as a Virgin appearing to an Indian.\"\n\nIn the years intervening Oedipa had remembered Jesus because he'd seen that about Pierce and she hadn't. As if he were, in some unsexual way, competition. Now, drinking thick lukewarm coffee from a clay pot on the back burner of the yucateco's stove and listening to Jesus talk conspiracy, she wondered if, without the miracle of Pierce to reassure him, Jesus might not have quit his CIA eventually and gone over like everybody else to the majority priistas, and so never had to go into exile.\n\nThe dead man, like Maxwell's Demon, was the linking feature in a coincidence. Without him neither she nor Jesus would be exactly here, exactly now. It was enough, a coded warning. What, tonight, was chance? So her eyes did fall presently onto an ancient rolled copy of the anarcho-syndicalist paper Regeneration. The date was 1904 and there was no stamp next to the cancellation, only the hands truck image of the post horn.\n\n\"They arrive,\" said Arrabal. \"Have they been in the mails that long? Has my name been substituted for that of a member who's died? Has it really taken sixty years? Is it a reprint? Idle questions, I am a foot soldier. The\nhigher levels have their reasons.\" She carried this thought back out into the night with her. Down at the city beach, long after the pizza stands and rides had closed, she walked unmolested through a drifting, dreamy cloud of delinquents in summer-weight gang jackets with the post horn stitched on in thread that looked pure silver in what moonlight there was. They had all been smoking, snuffing or injecting something, and perhaps did not see her at all.\nRiding among an exhausted bashful of Negroes going on to graveyard shifts all over the city, she saw scratched on the back of a seat, shining for her in the brilliant smoky interior, the post horn with the legend DEATH. But unlike WASTE, somebody had troubled to write in, in pencil: DON'T EVER ANTAGONIZE THE\nHORN.\n\nSomewhere near Fillmore she found the symbol tacked to the bulletin board of a Laundromat, among other scraps of paper offering cheap ironing and baby sitters. If you know what this means, the note said, you know where to find out more. Around her the odor of chlorine bleach rose heavenward, like an incense. Machines chugged and sloshed fiercely. Except for Oedipa the place was deserted, and the fluorescent bulbs seemed to shriek whiteness, to which everything their light touched was dedicated. It was a Negro neighborhood. Was The Horn so dedicated? Would it Antagonize The Horn to ask? Who could she ask?\nIn the buses all night she listened to transistor radios playing songs in the lower stretches of the Top 200, that would never become popular, whose melodies and lyrics would perish as if they had never been sung. A Mexican girl, trying to hear one of these through snarling static from the bus's motor, hummed along as if she would remember it always, tracing post horns and hearts with a fingernail, in the haze of her breath on the window.\n\nOut at the airport Oedipa, feeling invisible, eavesdropped on a poker game whose steady loser entered each loss neat and conscientious in a little balance-book decorated inside with scrawled post horns. \"I'm averaging a 99.375 percent return, fellas,\" she heard him say. The others, strangers, looked at him, some blank, some annoyed. \"That's averaging it out, over 23 years,\" he went on, trying a smile. \"Always just that little percent on the wrong side of breaking even. Twenty-three years. I'll never get ahead of it. Why don't I quit?\" Nobody answering.\n\nIn one of the latrines was an advertisement by AC-DC, standing for Alameda County Death Cult, along with a box number and post horn. Once a month they were to choose some victim from among the innocent, the virtuous, the socially integrated and well-adjusted, using him sexually, then sacrificing him. Oedipa did not copy the number. Catching a TWA flight to Miami was an uncoordinated boy who planned to slip at night into aquariums and open negotiations with the dolphins, who would succeed man. He was kissing his mother passionately goodbye, using his tongue. \"I'll write, ma,\" he kept saying. \"Write by WASTE,\" she said, \"remember. The government will open it if you use the other. The dolphins will be mad.\" \"I love you, ma,\" he said. \"Love the dolphins,\" she advised him. \"Write by WASTE.\"\n\nSo it went. Oedipa played the voyeur and listener. Among her other encounters were a facially-deformed welder, who cherished his ugliness; a child roaming the night who missed the death before birth as certain outcasts do the dear lulling blankness of the community; a Negro woman with an intricately-marbled scar along the baby-fat of one cheek who kept going through rituals of miscarriage each for a different reason, deliberately as others might the ritual of birth, dedicated not to continuity but to some kind of interregnum; an aging night-watchman, nibbling at a bar of Ivory Soap, who had trained his virtuoso stomach to accept also lotions, air-fresheners, fabrics, tobaccos and waxes in a hopeless attempt to assimilate it all, all the promise, productivity, betrayal, ulcers, before it was too late; and even another voyeur, who hung outside one of the city's still-lighted windows, searching for who knew what specific image. Decorating each alienation, each species of withdrawal, as cufflink, decal, aimless doodling, there was somehow always the post horn. She grew so to expect it that perhaps she did not see it quite as often as she later was to remember seeing it. A couple-three times would really have been enough. Or too much.\n\nShe busrode and walked on into the lightening morning, giving herself up to a fatalism rare for her. Where was the Oedipa who'd driven so bravely up here from San Francisco? That optimistic baby had come on so like the private eye in any long-ago radio drama, believing all you needed was grit, resourcefulness, exemption from hidebound cops' rules, to solve any great mystery.\nBut the private eye sooner or later has to get beat up on. This night's profusion of post horns, this malignant, deliberate replication, was their way of beating up. They knew her pressure points, and the ganglia of her optimism, and one by one, pinch by precision pinch, they were immobilizing her.\nLast night, she might have wondered what undergrounds apart from the couple she knew of communicated by WASTE system. By sunrise she could legitimately ask what undergrounds didn't. If miracles were, as Jesus Arrabal had postulated years ago on the beach at Mazatlan, intrusions into this world from another, a kiss of cosmic pool balls, then so must be each of the night's post horns.\n\nFor here were God knew how many citizens, deliberately choosing not to communicate by U. S. Mail. It was not an act of treason, nor possibly even of defiance. But it was a calculated withdrawal, from the life of the Republic, from its machinery. Whatever else was being denied them out of hate, indifference to the power of their vote, loopholes, simple ignorance, this withdrawal was their own, un-publicized, private. Since they could not have withdrawn into a vacuum (could they?), there had to exist the separate, silent, unsuspected world.\n\nJust before the morning rush hour, she got out of a jitney whose ancient driver ended each day in the red, downtown on Howard Street, began to walk toward the Embarcadero. She knew she looked terrible knuckles black with eye-liner and mascara from where she'd rubbed, mouth tasting of old booze and coffee. Through an open doorway, on the stair leading up into the disinfectant-smelling twilight of a rooming house she saw an old man huddled, shaking with grief she couldn't hear. Both hands, smoke-white, covered his face. On the back of the left hand she made out the post horn, tattooed in old ink now beginning to blur and spread. Fascinated, she came into the shadows and ascended creaking steps, hesitating on each one. When she was three steps from him the hands flew apart and his wrecked face, and the terror of eyes gloried in burst veins, stopped her.\n\n\"Can I help?\" She was shaking, tired. \"My wife's in Fresno,\" he said. He wore an old double-breasted suit, frayed gray shirt, wide tie, no hat. \"I left her. So long ago, I don't remember. Now this is for her.\" He gave Oedipa a letter that looked like he'd been carrying it around for years. \"Drop it in the,\" and he held up the tattoo and stared into her eyes, \"you know. I can't go out there. It's too far now, I had a bad night.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said. \"But I'm new in town. I don't know where it is.\"\"Under the freeway.\" He waved her on in the direction she'd been going. \"Always one. You'll see it.\" The eyes closed. Cammed each night out of that safe furrow the bulk of this city's waking each sunrise again set virtuously to plowing, what rich soils had he turned, what concentric planets uncovered? What voices overheard, flinders of luminescent gods glimpsed among the wallpaper's stained foliage, candlestubs lit to rotate in the air over him, prefiguring the cigarette he or a friend must fall asleep someday smoking, thus to end among the flaming, secret salts held all those years by the insatiable stuffing of a mattress that could keep vestiges of every nightmare sweat, helpless overflowing bladder, viciously, tearfully consummated wet dream, like the memory bank to a computer of the lost? She was overcome all at once by a need to touch him, as if she could not believe in him, or would not remember him, without it.\n\nExhausted, hardly knowing what she was doing, she came the last three steps and sat, took the man in her arms, actually held him, gazing out of her smudged eyes down the stairs, back into the morning. She felt wetness against her breast and saw that he was crying again. He hardly breathed but tears came as if being pumped. \"I can't help,\" she whispered, rocking him, \"I can't help.\" It was already too many miles to Fresno. \"Is that him?\" a voice asked behind her, up the stairs. \"The sailor?\" \"He has a tattoo on his hand.\" \"Can you bring him up OK? That's him.\" She turned and saw an even older man, shorter, wearing a tall Homburg hat and smiling at them. \"I'd help you but I got a little arthritis.\" \"Does he have to come up?\" she said. \"Up there?\" \"Where else, lady?\" She didn't know. She let go of him for a moment, reluctant as if he were her own child, and he looked up at her. \"Come on,\" she said. He reached out the tattooed hand and she took that, and that was how they went the rest of the way up that flight, and then the two more: hand in hand, very slowly for the man with arthritis.\n\n\"He disappeared last night,\" he told her. \"Said he was going looking for his old lady. It's a thing he does, off and on.\" They entered a warren of rooms and corridors, lit by lo-watt bulbs, separated by beaverboard partitions. The old man followed them stiffly. At last he said, \"Here.\" In the little room were another suit, a couple of religious tracts, a rug, a chair. A picture of a saint, changing well-water to oil for Jerusalem's Easter lamps. Another bulb, dead. The bed. The mattress, waiting. She ran through then a scene she might play. She might find the landlord of this place, and bring him to court, and buy the sailor a new suit at Roos/Atkins, and shirt, and shoes, and give him the bus fare to Fresno after all. But with a sigh he had released her hand, while she was so lost in the fantasy that she hadn't felt it go away, as if he'd known the best moment to let go.\"Just mail the letter,\" he said, \"the stamp is on it.\" She looked and saw the familiar carmine 8^ airmail, with a jet flying by the Capitol dome. But at the top of the dome stood a tiny figure in deep black, with its arms outstretched. Oedipa wasn't sure what exactly was supposed to be on top of the Capitol, but knew it wasn't anything like that.\n\"Please,\" the sailor said. \"Go on now. You don't want to stay here.\" She looked in her purse, found a ten and a single, gave him the ten. \"I'll spend it on booze,\" he said.\n\n\"Remember your friends,\" said the arthritic, watching the ten.\"Bitch,\" said the sailor. \"Why didn't you wait till he was gone?\" Oedipa watched him make adjustments so he'd fit easier against the mattress. That stuffed memory. Regis-tera \"Give me a cigarette, Ramirez,\" the sailor said. \"I know you got one.\" Would it be today? \"Ramirez,\" she cried. The arthritic looked around on his rusty neck. \"He's going to die,\" she said.\"Who isn't?\" said Ramirez.\nShe remembered John Nefastis, talking about his Machine, and massive destruction of information. So when this mattress flared up around the sailor, in his Viking's funeral: the stored, coded years of uselessness, early death, self-harrowing, the sure decay of hope, the set of all men who had slept on it, whatever their lives had been, would truly cease to be, forever, when the mattress burned. She stared at it in wonder. It was as if she had just discovered the irreversible process. It astonished her to think that so much could be lost, even the quantity of hallucination belonging just to the sailor that the world would bear no further trace of. She knew, because she had held him, that he suffered DT's.\n\nBehind the initials was a metaphor, a delirium tremens, a trembling unfurrowing of the mind's plowshare. The saint whose water can light lamps, the clairvoyant whose lapse in recall is the breath of God, the true paranoid for whom all is organized in spheres joyful or threatening about the central pulse of himself, the dreamer whose puns probe ancient fetid shafts and tunnels of truth all act in the same special relevance to the word, or whatever it is the word is there, buffering, to protect us from. The act of metaphor then was a 7 thrust at truth and a lie, depending where you were: inside, safe, or outside, lost. Oedipa did not know where she was. Trembling, unfurrowed, she slipped sidewise, screeching back across grooves of years, to hear again the earnest, high voice of her second or third collegiate love Ray Glozing bitching among \"uhs\" and the syncopated tonguing of a cavity, about his freshman calculus; \"dt,\" God help this old tattooed man, meant also a time differential, a vanishingly small instant in which change had to be confronted at last for what it was, where it could no longer disguise itself as something innocuous like an average rate; where velocity dwelled in the projectile though the projectile be frozen in midflight, where death dwelled in the cell though the cell be looked in on at its most quick.\n\nShe knew that the sailor had seen worlds no other man had seen if only because there was that high magic to low puns, because DT's must give access to dt's of spectra beyond the known sun, music made purely of Antarctic loneliness and fright. But nothing she knew of would preserve them, or him. She gave him goodbye, walked downstairs and then on, in the direction he'd told her. For an hour she prowled among the sunless, concrete underpinnings of the freeway, finding drunks, bums, pedestrians, pederasts, hookers, walking psychotic, no secret mailbox. But at last in the shadows she did come on a can with a swinging trapezoidal top, the kind you throw trash in: old and green, nearly four feet high. On the swinging part were hand-painted the initials W.A.S.T.E. She had to look closely to see the periods between the letters.\nOedipa settled back in the shadow of a column. She may have dozed off. She woke to see a kid dropping a bundle of letters into- the can. She went over and dropped in the sailor's letter to Fresno; then hid again and waited. Toward midday a rangy young wino showed up with a sack; unlocked a panel at the side of the box and took out all the letters. Oedipa gave him half a block's start, then began to tail him. Congratulating herself on having thought to wear flats, at least. The carrier led her across Market then over toward City Hall. In a street close enough to the drab, stone openness of the Civic Center to be infected by its gray, he rendezvoused with another carrier, and they exchanged sacks. Oedipa decided to stick with the one she'd been following. She tailed him all the way back down the littered, shifty, loud length of Market and over on First Street to the trans-bay bus terminal, where he bought a ticket for Oakland. So did Oedipa.\n\nThey rode over the bridge and into the great, empty glare of the Oakland afternoon. The landscape lost all variety. The carrier got off in a neighborhood Oedipa couldn't identify. She followed him for hours along streets whose names she never knew, across arterials that even with the afternoon's lull nearly murdered her, into slums and out, up long hillsides jammed solid with two- or three-bedroom houses, all their windows giving blankly back only the sun. One by one his sack of letters emptied. At length he climbed on a Berkeley bus. Oedipa followed. Halfway up Telegraph the carrier got off and led her down the street to a pseudo-Mexican apartment house. Not once had he looked behind him. John Nefastis lived here. She was back where she'd started, and could not believe 24 hours had passed. Should it have been more or less?\nBack in the hotel she found the lobby full of deaf-mute delegates in party hats, copied in crepe paper after the fur Chinese communist jobs made popular during the Korean conflict. They were every one of them drunk, and a few of the men grabbed her, thinking to bring her along to a party in the grand ballroom. She tried to struggle out of the silent, gesturing swarm, but was too weak. Her legs ached, her mouth tasted horrible. They swept her on into the ballroom, where she was seized about the waist by a handsome young man in a Harris tweed coat and waltzed round and round, through the rustling, shuffling hush, under a great unlit chandelier. Each couple on the floor danced whatever was in the fellow's head: tango, two-step, bossa nova, slop.\n\nBut how long, Oedipa thought, could it go on before collisions became a serious hindrance? There would have to be collisions. The only alternative was some unthinkable order of music, many rhythms, all keys at once, a choreography in which each couple meshed easy, predestined. Something they all heard with an extra sense atrophied in herself. She followed her partner's lead, limp in the young mute's clasp, waiting for the collisions to begin. But none came. She was danced for half an hour before, by mysterious consensus, everybody took a break, without having felt any touch but the touch of her partner. Jesus Arrabal would have called it an anarchist miracle. Oedipa, withno name for it, was only demoralized. She curtsied and fled.\n\nNext day, after twelve hours of sleep and no dreams to speak of, Oedipa checked out of the hotel and drove down the peninsula to Kinneret. She had decided on route, with time to think about the day preceding, to go see Dr Hilarius her shrink, and tell him all. She might well be in the cold and sweatless meathooks of a psychosis. With her own eyes she had verified a WASTE system: seen two WASTE postmen, a WASTE mailbox, WASTE stamps, WASTE cancellations. And the image of the muted post horn all but saturating the Bay Area. Yet she wanted it all to be fantasy some clear result of her several wounds, needs, dark doubles. She wanted Hilarius to tell her she was some kind of a nut and needed a rest, and that there was no Trystero. She also wanted to know why the chance of its being real should menace her so.\n\nShe pulled into the drive at Hilarius's clinic a little after sunset. The light in his office didn't seem to be on. Eucalyptus branches blew in a great stream of air that flowed downhill, sucked to the evening sea. Halfway along the flagstone path, she was startled by an insect whirring loudly past her ear, followed at once by the sound of a gunshot. That was no insect, thought Oedipa, at which point, hearing another shot, she made the connection. In the fading light she was a clear target; the only way to go was toward the clinic. She dashed up to the glass doors, found them locked, the lobby inside dark. Oedipa picked up a rock next to a flower bed and heaved it at one of the doors. It bounced off. She was looking around for another rock when a white shape appeared inside, fluttering up to the door and unlocking it for her. It was Helga Blamm, Hilarius's sometime assistant.\n\n\"Hurry,\" she chattered, as Oedipa slipped inside. The woman was close to hysterical.\"What's happening?\" Oedipa said.\"He's gone crazy. I tried to call the police, but he took a chair and smashed the switchboard with it.\" \"Dr Hilarius?\" \"He thinks someone's after him.\" Tear streaks had meandered down over the nurse's cheekbones. \"He's locked himself in the office with that rifle.\" A Gewehr 43, from the war, Oedipa recalled, that he kept as a souvenir. \"He shot at me. Do you think anybody will report it?\" \"Well he's shot at half a dozen people,\" replied Nurse Blamm, leading Oedipa down a corridor to her office. \"Somebody better report it.\" Oedipa noticed that the window opened on a safe line of retreat.\"You could've run,\" she said. Blamm, running hot water from a washbasin tap into cups and stirring in instant coffee, looked up, quizzical. \"He might need somebody.\"\"Who's supposed to be after him?\"\n\"Three men with submachine guns, he said. Terrorists, fanatics, that was all I got. He started breaking up the PBX.\" She gave Oedipa a hostile look. \"Too many nutty broads, that's what did it. Kinneret is full of nothing but. He couldn't cope.\"\n\n\"I've been away for a while,\" Oedipa said. \"Maybe I could find out what it is. Maybe I'd be less of a threat for him.\" Blamm burned her mouth on the coffee. \"Start telling him your troubles and he'll probably shoot you.\" In front of his door, which she could never remember having seen closed, Oedipa stood hipshot awhile, questioning her own sanity. Why hadn't she split out through Blamm's window and read about the rest of it in the paper? \"Who is it?\" Hilarius screamed, having picked up her breathing, or something. \"Mrs. Maas.\"\n\"May Speer and his ministry of cretins rot eternally in hell. Do you realize that half these rounds are duds?\" \"May I come in? Could we talk?\" \"I'm sure you'd all like that,\" Hilarius said. \"I'm unarmed. You can frisk me.\"\n\"While you karate-chop me in the spine, no thank you.\"\"Why are you resisting every suggestion I make?\"\"Listen,\" Hilarius said after a while, \"have I seemed to you a good enough Freudian? Have I ever deviated seriously?\"\"You made faces now and then,\" said Oedipa, \"but that's minor.\"His response was a long, bitter laugh. Oedipa waited. \"I tried,\" the shrink behind the door said, \"to submit myself to that man, to the ghost of that cantankerous Jew. Tried to cultivate a faith in the literal truth of everything he wrote, even the idiocies and contradictions. It was the least I could have done, nicht wahr? A kind of penance.\n\n\"And part of me must have really wanted to believe like a child hearing, in perfect safety, a tale of horror that the unconscious would be like any other room, once the light was let in. That the dark shapes would resolve only into toy horses and Biedermeyer furniture. That therapy could tame it after all, bring it into society with no fear of its someday reverting. I wanted to believe, despite everything my life had been. Can you imagine?\"She could not, having no idea what Hilarius had done before showing up in Kinneret. Far away she now heard sirens, the electronic kind the local cops used, that sounded like a slide-whistle being played over a PA. system. With linear obstinacy they grew louder.\n\n\"Yes, I hear them,\" Hilarius said. \"Do you think anyone can protect me from these fanatics? They walk through walls. They replicate: you flee them, turn a corner, and there they are, coming for you again.\" \"Do me a favor?\" Oedipa said. \"Don't shoot at the cops, they're on your side.\"\"Your Israeli has access to every uniform known,\" Hilarius said. \"I can't guarantee the safety of the 'police.' You couldn't guarantee where they'd take me if I surrendered, could you.\" She heard him pacing around his office. Unearthly siren-sounds converged on them from all over the night. \"There is a face,\" Hilarius said, \"that I can make. One you haven't seen; no one in this country has. I have only made it once in my life, and perhaps today in central Europe there still lives, in whatever vegetable ruin, the young man who saw it. He would be, now, about your age. Hopelessly insane. His name was Zvi. Will you tell the 'police,' or whatever they are calling themselves tonight, that I can make that face again? That it has an effective radius of a hundred yards and drives anyone unlucky enough to see it down forever into the darkened oubliette, among the terrible shapes, and secures the hatch irrevocably above them? Thank you.\"\nThe sirens had reached the front of the clinic. She heard car doors slamming, cops yelling, suddenly a great smash as they broke in. The office door opened then. Hilarius grabbed her by the wrist, pulled her inside, locked the door again.\n\n\"So now I'm a hostage,\" Oedipa said.\"Oh,\" said Hilarius, \"it's you.\"\n\"Well who did you think you'd been\" \"Discussing my case with? Another. There is me, there are the others. You know, with the LSD, we're finding, the distinction begins to vanish. Egos lose their sharp edges. But I never took the drug, I chose to remain in relative paranoia, where at least I know who I am and who the others are. Perhaps that is why you also refused to participate, Mrs Maas?\" He held the rifle at sling arms and beamed at her. \"Well, then. You were supposed to deliver a message to me, I assume. From them. What were you supposed to say?\"Oedipa shrugged. \"Face up to your social responsibilities,\" she suggested. \"Accept the reality principle. You're outnumbered and they have superior firepower.\"\"Ah, outnumbered. We were outnumbered there too.\" He watched her with a coy look.\"Where?\"\"Where I made that face. Where I did my internship.\"She knew then approximately what he was talking about, but to narrow it said, \"Where,\" again.\"Buchenwald,\" replied Hilarius. Cops began hammering on the office door.\"He has a gun,\" Oedipa called, \"and I'm in here.\"\n\"Who are you, lady?\" She told him. \"How do you spell that first name?\" He also took down her address, age, phone number, next of kin, husband's occupation, for the news media. Hilarius all the while was rummaging in his desk for more ammo. \"Can you talk him out of it?\" the cop wanted to know. \"TV folks would like to get some footage through the window. Could you keep him occupied?\"\n\"Hang tough,\" Oedipa advised, \"we'll see.\" \"Nice act you all have there,\" nodded Hilarius. \"You think,\" said Oedipa, \"then, that they're trying to bring you back to Israel, to stand trial, like they did Eichinann?\" The shrink kept nodding. \"Why? What did you do at Buchenwald?\"\n\n\"I worked,\" Hilarius told her, \"on experimentally-induced insanity. A catatonic Jew was as good as a dead one. Liberal SS circles felt it would be more humane.\" So they had gone at their subjects with metronomes, serpents, Brechtian vignettes at midnight, surgical removal of certain glands, magic-lantern hallucinations, new drugs, threats recited over hidden loudspeakers, hypnotism, clocks that ran backward, and faces. Hilarius had been put in charge of faces. \"The Allied liberators,\" he reminisced, \"arrived, unfortunately, before we could gather enough data. Apart from the spectacular successes, like Zvi, there wasn't much we could point to in a statistical way.\" He smiled at the expression on her face. \"Yes, you hate me. But didn't I try to atone? If I'd been a real Nazi I'd have chosen Jung, nicht wahr? But I chose Freud instead, the Jew. Freud's vision of the world had no Buchenwalds in it. Buchenwald, according to Freud, once the light was let in, would become a soccer field, fat children would learn flower-arranging and solfeggio in the strangling rooms. At Auschwitz the ovens would be converted over to petit fours and wedding cakes, and the V-2 missiles to public housing for the elves. I tried to believe it all. I slept three hours a night trying not to dream, and spent the other 21 at the forcible acquisition of faith. And yet my penance hasn't been enough. They've come like angels of death to get me, despite all I tried to do.\"\n\n\"How's it going?\" the cop inquired. \"Just marv,\" said Oedipa. \"I'll let you know if it's hopeless.\" Then she saw that Hilarius had left the Gewehr on his desk and was across the room ostensibly trying to open a file cabinet. She picked the rifle up, pointed it at him, and said, \"I ought to kill you.\" She knew he had wanted her to get the weapon. \"Isn't that what you've been sent to do?\" He crossed and uncrossed his eyes at her; stuck out his tongue tentatively.\"I came,\" she said, \"hoping you could talk me out of a fantasy.\"\n\"Cherish it!\" cried Hilarius, fiercely. \"What else do any of you have? Hold it tightly by its little tentacle, don't let the Freudians coax it away or the pharmacists poison it out of you. Whatever it is, hold it dear, for when you lose it you go over by that much to the others. You begin to cease to be.\"\n\"Come on in,\" Oedipa yelled.\n\nTears sprang to Hilarius's eyes. \"You aren't going to shoot?\"The cop tried the door. \"It's locked, hey,\" he said.\"Bust it down,\" roared Oedipa, \"and Hitler Hilarius here will foot the bill.\"Outside, as a number of nervous patrolmen approached Hilarius, holding up strait jackets and billy clubs they would not need, and as three rival ambulances backed snarling up onto the lawn, jockeying for position, causing Helga Blamm between sobs to call the drivers filthy names, Oedipa spotted among searchlights and staring crowds a KCUF mobile unit, with her husband Mucho inside it, spieling into a microphone. She moseyed over past snapping flashbulbs and stuck her head in the window. \"Hi.\" Mucho pressed his cough button a moment, but only smiled. It seemed odd. How could they hear a smile? Oedipa got in, trying not to make noise. Mucho thrust the mike in front of her, mumbling, \"You're on, just be yourself.\" Then in his earnest broadcasting voice, \"How do you feel about this terrible thing?\" \"Terrible,\" said Oedipa.\n\n\"Wonderful,\" said Mucho. He had her go on to give listeners a summary of what'd happened in the office. \"Thank you, Mrs Edna Mosh,\" he wrapped up, \"for your eyewitness account of this dramatic siege at the Hilarius Psychiatric Clinic. This is KCUF Mobile Two, sending it back now to 'Rabbit' Warren, at the studio.\" He cut his power. Something was not quite right. \"Edna Mosh?\" Oedipa said. \"It'll come out the right way,\" Mucho said. \"I was allowing for the distortion on these rigs, and then when they put it on tape.\"\"Where are they taking him?\" \"Community hospital, I guess,\" Mucho said, \"for observation. I wonder what they can observe.\"\"Israelis,\" Oedipa said, \"coming in the windows. If there aren't any, he's crazy.\" Cops came over and they chatted awhile. They told her to stay around Kinneret in case there was legal action. At length she returned to her rented car and followed Mucho back to the studio. Tonight he had the one-to-six shift on the air.\n\nIn the hallway outside the loud ratcheting teletype room, Mucho upstairs in the office typing out his story, Qedipa encountered the program director, Caesar Punch. \"Sure glad you're back,\" he greeted her, clearly at a loss for her first name.\"Oh?\" said Oedipa, \"and why is that.\"\"Frankly,\" confided Punch, \"since you left, Wen-dell hasn't been himself.\"\"And who,\" said Oedipa, working herself into a rage because Punch was right, \"pray, has he been, Ringo Starr?\" Punch cowered. \"Chubby Checker?\" she pursued him toward the lobby, \"the Righteous Brothers? And why tell me?\"\"All of the above,\" said Punch, seeking to hide his head, \"Mrs Maas.\"\"Oh, call me Edna. What do you mean?\" \"Behind his back,\" Punch was whining, \"they're calling him the Brothers N. He's losing his identity, Edna, how else can I put it? Day by day, Wendell is less himself and more generic. He enters a staff meeting and the room is suddenly full of people, you know? He's a walking assembly of man.\"\"It's your imagination,\" Oedipa said. \"You've been smoking those cigarettes without the printing on them again.\"\n\"You'll see. Don't mock me. We have to stick together. Who else worries about him?\"\n\nShe sat alone then on a bench outside Studio A, listening to Mucho's colleague Rabbit Warren spin records. Mucho came downstairs carrying his copy, a serenity about him she'd never seen. He used to hunch his shoulders and have a rapid eye blink rate, and both now were gone, \"Wait,\" he smiled, and dwindled down the hall. She scrutinized him from behind, trying to see iridescences, auras.\nThey had some time before he was on. They drove downtown to a pizzeria and bar, and faced each other through the fluted gold lens of a beer pitcher.\n\"How are you getting on with Metzger?\" he said. \"There's nothing,\" she said. \"Not any more, at least,\" said Mucho. \"I could tell that when you were talking into the mike.\"\n\n\"That's pretty good,\" Oedipa said. She couldn't figure the expression on his face. \"It's extraordinary,\" said Mucho, \"everything's been wait. Listen.\" She heard nothing unusual. \"There are seventeen violins on that cut,\" Mucho said, \"and one of them I can't tell where he was because it's monaural here, damn.\" It dawned on her that he was talking about the Muzak. It has been seeping in, in its subliminal, unidentifiable way since they'd entered the place, all strings, reeds, muted brass. \"What is it,\" she said, feeling anxious. \"His E string,\" Mucho said, \"it's a few cycles sharp. - He can't be a studio musician. Do you think somebody could do the dinosaur bone bit with that one string, Oed? With just his set of notes on that cut. Figure out what his ear is like, and then the musculature of his hands and arms, and eventually the entire man. God, wouldn't that be wonderful.\" \"Why should you want to?\" \"He was real. That wasn't synthetic. They could dispense with live musicians if they wanted. Put together all the right overtones at the right power levels so it'd come out like a violin. Like I ...\" he hesitated before breaking into a radiant smile, \"you'll think I'm crazy, Oed. But I can do the same thing in reverse. Listen to anything and take it apart again. Spectrum analysis, in my head. I can break down chords, and timbres, and words too into all the basic frequencies and harmonics, with all their different loudness\u2019s, and listen to them, each pure tone, but all at once.\" \"How can you do that?\"\n\n\"It's like I have a separate channel for each one,\" Mucho said, excited, \"and if I need more I just expand. Add on what I need. I don't know how it works, but lately I can do it with people talking too. Say 'rich, chocolaty goodness.'\" \"Rich, chocolaty, goodness,\" said Oedipa. \"Yes,\" said Mucho, and fell silent. \"Well, what?\" Oedipa asked after a couple minutes, with an edge to her voice. \"I noticed it the other night hearing Rabbit do a commercial. No matter who's talking, the different power spectra are the same, give or take a small percentage. So you and Rabbit have something in common now. More than that. Everybody who says the same words is the same person if the spectra are the same only they happen differently in time, you dig? But the time is arbitrary. You pick your zero point anywhere you want, that way you can shuffle each person's time line sideways till they all coincide. Then you'd have this big, God, maybe a couple hundred million chorus saying 'rich, chocolaty goodness' together, and it would all be the same voice.\"\n\n\"Mucho,\" she said, impatient but also flirting with a wild suspicion. \"Is this what Punch means when he says you're coming on like a whole roomful of people?\" \"That's what I am,\" said Mucho, \"right. Everybody is.\" He gazed at her, perhaps having had his vision of consensus as others do orgasms, face now smooth, amiable, at peace. She didn't know him. Panic started to climb out of a dark region in her head. \"Whenever I put the headset on now,\" he'd continued, \"I really do understand what I find there. When those kids sing about 'She loves you,' yeah well, you know, she does, she's any number of people, all over the world, back through time, different colors, sizes, ages, shapes, distances from death, but she loves. And the 'you' is everybody. And herself. Oedipa, the human voice, you know, it's a flipping miracle.\" His eyes brimming, reflecting the color of beer.\n\n\"Baby,\" she said, helpless, knowing of nothing she could do for this, and afraid for him. He put a little clear plastic bottle on the table between them. She stared at the pills in it, and then understood. \"That's LSD?\" she said. Mucho smiled back. \"Where'd you get it?\" Knowing.\"Hilarius. He broadened his program to include husbands.\"\"Look then,\" Oedipa said, trying to be businesslike, \"how long has it been, that you've been on this?\" He honestly couldn't remember.\"But there may be a chance you're not addicted yet.\"\n\"Oed,\" looking at her puzzled, \"you don't get addicted. It's not like you're some hophead. You take it because it's good. Because you hear and see things, even smell them, taste like you never could. Because the world is so abundant. No end to it, baby. You're an antenna, sending your pattern out across a million lives a night, and they're your lives too.\" He had this patient, motherly look now. Oedipa wanted to hit him in the mouth. \"The songs, it's not just that they say something, they are something, in the pure sound. Something new. And my dreams have changed.\"\n\n\"Oh, goodo.\" Flipping her hair a couple times, furious, \"No nightmares anymore? Fine. So your latest little friend, whoever she is, she really made out. At that age, you know, they need all the sleep they can get.\" \"There's no girl, Oed. Let me tell you. The bad dream that I used to have all the time, about the car lot, remember that? I could never even tell you about it. But I can now. It doesn't bother me anymore. It was only that sign in the lot, that's what scared me. In the dream I'd be going about a normal day's business and suddenly, with no warning, there'd be the sign. We were a member of the National Automobile Dealers' Association. N.A.D.A. Just this creaking metal sign that said nada, nada, against the blue sky. I used to wake up hollering.\" She remembered. Now he would never be spooked again, not as long as he had the pills. She could not quite get it into her head that the day she'd left him for San Francisco was the day she'd seen Mucho for the last time. So much of him already had dissipated.\n\n\"Oh, listen,\" he was saying, \"Oed, dig.\" But she couldn't even tell what the tune was. When it was time for him to go back to the station, he nodded toward the pills. \"You could have those.\"She shook her head no.\"You're going back to San Francisco?\"\"Tonight, yes.\" \"But the cops.\"\"I'll be a fugitive.\" Later she couldn't remember if they'd said anything else. At the station they kissed goodbye, all of them. As Mucho walked away he was whistling something complicated, twelve-tone. Oedipa sat with her forehead resting on the steering wheel and remembered that she hadn't asked him about the Trys-tero cancellation on his letter. But by then it was too late to make any difference.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1566447", "artist_names": "Percy Mayfield", "full_title": "River's Invitation

Will the candid reader, by way of closing this Book Third, listen to a few transient remarks on that subject?\n\nCandid readers have not lately met with any man who had less notion to interfere with their Thirty-Nine, or other Church- Articles; wherewith, very helplessly as is like, they may have struggled to form for themselves some not inconceivable hypothesis about this Universe, and their own Existence there. Superstition, my friend, is far from me; Fanaticism, for any Fanum likely to arise soon on this Earth, is far. A man's Church-Articles are surely articles of price to him; and in these times one has to be tolerant of many strange 'Articles,' and of many still stranger 'No-articles,' which go about placarding themselves in a very distracted manner,\u2014the numerous long placard-poles, and questionable infirm paste-pots, interfering with one's peaceable thoroughfare sometimes!\n\nFancy a man, moreover, recommending his fellow men to believe in God, that so Chartism might abate, and the Manchester Operatives be got to spin peaceably! The idea is more distracted than any placard-pole seen hitherto in a public thoroughfare of men! My friend, if thou ever do come to believe in God, thou wilt find all Chartism, Manchester riot, Parliamentary incompetence, Ministries of Windbag, and the wildest Social Dissolutions, and the burning up of this entire Planet, a most small matter in comparison. Brother, this Planet, I find, is but an inconsiderable sandgrain in the continents of Being: this Planet's poor temporary interests, thy interests and my interests there, when I look fixedly into that eternal Light-Sea and Flame- Sea with its eternal interests, dwindle literally into Nothing; my speech of it is\u2014silence for the while. I will as soon think of making Galaxies and Star Systems to guide little herring- vessels by, as of preaching Religion that the Constable may continue possible. O my Advanced-Liberal friend, this new second progress, of proceeding 'to invent God,' is a very strange one! Jacobinism unfolded into Saint-Simonism bodes innumerable blessed things; but the thing itself might draw tears from a Stoic!\u2014As for me, some twelve or thirteen New Religions, heavy Packets, most of them unfranked, having arrived here from various parts of the world, in a space of six calendar months, I have instructed my invaluable friend the Stamped Postman to introduce no more of them, if the charge exceed one penny.\n\nHenry of Essex, duelling in that Thames Island, near to Reading Abbey, had a religion. But was it in virtue of his seeing armed Phantasms of St. Edmund 'on the rim of the horizon,' looking minatory on him? Had that, intrinsically, anything to do with his religion at all? Henry of Essex's religion was the Inner Light or Moral Conscience of his own soul; such as is vouchsafed still to all souls of men;\u2014which Inner Light shone here 'through such intellectual and other media' as there were; producing 'Phantasms,' Kircherean Visual-Spectra, according to circumstances! It is so with all men. The clearer my Inner Light may shine, through the less turbid media; the fewer Phantasms it may produce,\u2014the gladder surely shall I be, and not the sorrier! Hast thou reflected, O serious reader, Advanced- Liberal or other, that the one end, essence, use of all religion past, present and to come, was this only: To keep that same Moral Conscience or Inner Light of ours alive and shining\u2014which certainly the 'Phantasms' and the 'turbid media' were not essential for! All religion was here to remind us, better or worse, of what we already know better or worse, of the quite infinite difference there is between a Good man and a Bad; to bid us love infinitely the one, abhor and avoid infinitely the other,\u2014strive infinitely to be the one, and not to be the other. 'All religion issues in due Practical Hero-worship: He that has a soul unasphyxied will never want a religion; he that has a soul asphyxied, reduced to a succedaneum for salt, will never find any religion, though you rose from the dead to preach him one.\n\nBut indeed, when men and reformers ask for 'a religion,' it is analogous to their asking, 'What would you have us to do?' and such like. They fancy that their religion too shall be a kind of Morrison's Pill, which they have only to swallow once, and all will be well. Resolutely once gulp down your Religion, your Morrison's Pill, you have it all plain sailing now; you can follow your affairs, your no-affairs, go along money-hunting, pleasure-hunting, dilettanteing, dangling, and miming and chattering like a Dead-Sea Ape: your Morrison will do your business for you. Men's notions are very strange!\u2014Brother, I say there is not, was not, nor will ever be, in the wide circle of Nature, any Pill or Religion of that character. Man cannot afford thee such; for the very gods it is impossible. I advise thee to renounce Morrison; once for all, quit hope of the Universal Pill. For body, for soul, for individual or society, there has not any such article been made. Non extat. In Created Nature it is not, was not, will not be. In the void imbroglios of Chaos only, and realms of Bedlam, does some shadow of it hover, to bewilder and bemock the poor inhabitants there.\nRituals, Liturgies, Creeds, Hierarchies: all this is not religion; all this, were it dead as Odinism, as Fetishism, does not kill religion at all! It is Stupidity alone, with never so many rituals, that kills religion. Is not this still a World? Spinning Cotton under Arkwright and Adam Smith; founding Cities by the Fountain of Juturna, on the Janiculum Mount; tilling Canaan under Prophet Samuel and Psalmist David, man is ever man; the missionary of Unseen Powers; and great and victorious, while he continues true to his mission; mean, miserable, foiled, and at last annihilated and trodden out of sight and memory, when he proves untrue. Brother, thou art a Man, I think; thou are not a mere building Beaver, or two-legged Cotton-Spider; thou hast verily a Soul in thee, asphyxied or otherwise! Sooty Manchester,\u2014it too is built on the infinite Abysses; overspanned by the skyey Firmaments; and there is birth in it, and death in it;\u2014and it is every whit as wonderful, as fearful, unimaginable, as the oldest Salem or Prophetic City. Go or stand, in what time, in what place we will, are there not Immensities, Eternities over us, around us, in us:\n\n'Solemn before us,\nVeiled, the dark Portal,\nGoal of all mortal:\u2014\nStars silent rest o'er us,\nGraves under us silent'\n\nBetween these two great Silences, the hum of all our spinning cylinders, Trades-Unions, Anti-Corn-Law Leagues and Carlton Clubs goes on. Stupidity itself ought to pause a little, and consider that. I tell thee, through all thy Ledgers, Supply-and-demand Philosophies, and daily most modern melancholy Business and Cant, there does shine the presence of a Primeval Unspeakable; and thou wert wise to recognise, not with lips only, that same!\n\nThe Maker's Laws, whether they are promulgated in Sinai Thunder, to the ear or imagination, or quite otherwise promulgated, are the Laws of God; transcendant, everlasting, imperatively demanding obedience from all men. This, without any thunder, or with never so much thunder, thou, if there be any soul left in thee, canst know of a truth. The Universe, I say, is made by Law; the great Soul of the World is just and not unjust. Look thou, if thou have eyes or soul left, into this great shoreless Incomprehensible: in the heart of its tumultuous Appearances, Embroilments, and mad Time-vortexes, is there not, silent, eternal, an All-just, an All-beautiful; sole Reality and ultimate controlling Power of the whole? This is not a figure of speech; this is a fact. The fact of Gravitation known to all animals, is not surer than this inner Fact, which may be known to all men. He who knows this, it will sink, silent, awful, unspeakable, into his heart. He will say with Faust: \"Who dare name HIM?\" Most rituals or 'namings' he will fall in with at present, are like to be 'namings'\u2014which shall be nameless! In silence, in the Eternal Temple, let him worship, if there be no fit word. Such knowledge, the crown of his whole spiritual being, the life of his life, let him keep and sacredly walk by. He has a religion. Hourly and daily, for himself and for the whole world, a faithful, unspoken, but not ineffectual prayer rises, \"Thy will be done.\" His whole work on Earth is an emblematic spoken or acted prayer, Be the will of God done on Earth,\u2014not the Devil's will, or any of the Devil's servants' wills! He has a religion, this man; an everlasting Loadstar that beams the brighter in the Heavens, the darker here on Earth grows the night around him. Thou, if thou know not this, what are all rituals, liturgies, mythologies, mass-chantings, turnings of the rotatory calabash? They are as nothing; in a good many respects they are as less. Divorced from this, getting half- divorced from this, they are a thing to fill one with a kind of horror; with a sacred inexpressible pity and fear. The most tragical thing a human eye can look on. It was said to the Prophet, \"Behold, I will shew thee worse things than these: women weeping to Thammuz.\" That was the acme of the Prophet's vision,\u2014then as now.\n\nRituals, Liturgies, Credos, Sinai Thunder: I know more or less the history of these; the rise, progress, decline and fall of these. Can thunder from all the thirty-two azimuths, repeated daily for centuries of years, make God's Laws more godlike to me? Brother, No. Perhaps I am grown to be a man now; and do not need the thunder and the terror any longer! Perhaps I am above being frightened; perhaps it is not Fear, but Reverence alone, that shall now lead me!\u2014Revelations, Inspirations? Yes: and thy own god-created Soul; dost thou not call that a `revelation?' Who made THEE? Where didst Thou come from? The Voice of Eternity, if thou be not a blasphemer and poor asphyxied mute, speaks with that tongue of thine! Thou art the latest Birth of Nature; it is 'the Inspiration of the Almighty' that giveth thee understanding! My brother, my brother!\u2014\n\nUnder baleful Atheisms, Mammonisms, Joe-Manton Dilettantisms, with their appropriate Cants and Idolisms, and whatsoever scandalous rubbish obscures and all but extinguishes the soul of man,\u2014religion now is; its Laws, written if not on stone tables, yet on the Azure of Infinitude, in the inner heart of God's Creation, certain as Life, certain as Death! I say the Laws are there, and thou shalt not disobey them. It were better for thee not. Better a hundred deaths than yes. Terrible 'penalties' withal, if thou still need 'penalties,' are there for disobeying. Dost thou observe, O redtape Politician, that fiery infernal Phenomenon, which men name FRENCH REVOLUTION, sailing, unlooked- for, unbidden; through thy inane Protocol Dominion:\u2014far-seen, with splendour not of Heaven? Ten centuries will see it. There were Tanneries at Meudon for human skins. And Hell, very truly Hell, had power over God's upper Earth for a season. The cruelest Portent that has risen into created Space these ten centuries: let us hail it, with awestruck repentant hearts, as the voice once more of a God, though of one in wrath. Blessed be the God's-voice; for it is true, and Falsehoods have to cease before it! But for that same preternatural quasi-infernal Portent; one could not know what to make of this wretched world, in these days' at all. The deplorablest quack-ridden, and now hunger-ridden, downtrodden Despicability and Flebile Ludibrium, of redtape Protocols, rotatory Calabashes, Poor-Law Bastilles: who is there that could think of its being fated to continue?\u2014\n\nPenalties enough, my brother! This penalty inclusive of all: Eternal Death to thy own hapless Self, if thou heed no other. Eternal Death, I say,\u2014with many meanings old and new, of which let this single one suffice us here: The eternal impossibility for thee to be aught but a Chimera, and swift-vanishing deceptive Phantasm, in God's Creation;\u2014swift-vanishing, never to reappear: why should it reappear! Thou hadst one chance, thou wilt never have another. Everlasting ages will roll on, and no other be given thee. The foolishest articulate-speaking soul now extant, may not he say to himself: \"A whole Eternity I waited to be born; and now I have a whole Eternity waiting to see what I will do when born!\" This is not Theology, this is Arithmetic. And thou but half-discernest this; thou but half-believest it? Alas, on the shores of the Dead Sea on Sabbath, there goes on a Tragedy!\u2014\n\nBut we will leave this of 'Religion;' of which, to say truth, it is chiefly profitable in these unspeakable days to keep silence. Thou needest no 'New Religion;' nor art thou like to get any. Thou hast already more 'religion' than thou makest use of. This day, thou knowest ten commanded duties, seest in thy mind ten things which should be done, for one that thou doest! Do one of them; this of itself will skew thee ten others which can and shall be done. \"But my future fate?\" Yes, thy future fate, indeed? Thy future fate, while thou makest it the chief question, seems to me\u2014extremely questionable! I do not think it can be good. Norse Odin, immemorial centuries ago, did not he, though a poor Heathen, in the dawn of Time, teach us that, for the Dastard there was and could be no good fate; no harbour anywhere, save down with Hela, in the pool of Night! Dastards, Knaves, are they that lust for Pleasure, that tremble at Pain. For this world and for the next, Dastards are a class of creatures made to be 'arrested;' they are good for nothing else, can look for nothing else. A greater than Odin has been here. A greater than Odin has taught us\u2014not a greater Dastardism, I hope! My brother, thou must pray for a soul; struggle, as with life-and-death energy, to get back thy soul! Know that 'religion' is no Morrison's Pill from without, but a reawakening of thy own Self from within:\u2014and, above all, leave me alone of thy 'religions' and 'new religions' here and elsewhere! I am weary of this sick croaking for a Morrison's-Pill religion; for any and for every such. I want none such; and discern all such to be impossible. The resuscitation of old liturgies fallen dead; much more, the manufacture of new liturgies that will never be alive: how hopeless Stylitisms, eremite fanaticisms and fakeerisms; spasmodic agonistic posturemakings, and narrow, cramped, morbid, if forever noble wrestlings: all this is not a thing desirable to me. It is a thing the world has done once, \u2014when its beard was not grown as now!\n\nAnd yet there is, at worst, one Liturgy which does remain forever unexceptionable: that of Praying (as the old Monks did withal) by Working. And indeed the Prayer which accomplished itself in special chapels at stated hours, and went not with a man, rising up from all his Work and Action, at all moments sanctifying the same,\u2014what was it ever good for? 'Work is Worship:' yes, in a highly considerable sense,\u2014which, in the present state of all 'worship,' who is there that can unfold! He that understands it well, understands the Prophecy of the whole Future; the last Evangel, which has included all others. Its cathedral the Dome of Immensity,\u2014hast thou seen it? coped with the star-galaxies; paved with the green mosaic of land and ocean; and for altar, verily, the Star-throne of the Eternal! Its litany and psalmody the noble acts, the heroic work and suffering, and true Heart- utterance of all the Valiant of the Sons of Men. Its choir-music the ancient Winds and Oceans, and deep-toned, inarticulate, but most speaking voices of Destiny and History,\u2014supernal ever as of old. Between two great Silences:\n\n'Stars silent rest o o'er us,\nGraves under us silent!'\n\nBetween which two great Silences, do not, as we said, all human Noises, in the naturalest times, most preternaturally march and roll?\u2014\nI will insert this also, in a lower strain, from Sauerteig's Aesthetische Springwurzel. 'Worship?' says he: 'Before that inane tumult of Hearsay filled men's heads, while the world lay yet silent, and the heart true and open, many things were Worship! To the primeval man whatsoever good came, descended on him (as, in mere fact, it ever does) direct from God; whatsoever duty lay visible for him, this a Supreme God had prescribed. To the present hour I ask thee, Who else? For the primeval man, in whom dwelt Thought, this Universe was all a Temple;\nLife everywhere a Worship.\n\n'What Worship, for example, is there not in mere Washing! Perhaps one of the most moral things a man, in common cases, has it in his power to do. Strip thyself, go into the bath, or were it into the limpid pool and running brook, and there wash and be clean; thou wilt step out again a purer and a better man. This consciousness of perfect outer pureness, that to thy skin there now adheres no foreign speck of imperfection, how it radiates in on thee, with cunning symbolic influences, to thy very soul! Thou hast an increase of tendency towards all good things whatsoever. The oldest Eastern Sages, with joy and holy gratitude, had felt it so,\u2014and that it was the Maker's gift and will. Whose else is it? It remains a religious duty, from oldest times, in the East.\u2014Nor could Herr Professor Strauss, when I put the question, deny that for us at present it is still such here in the West! To that dingy fuliginous Operative, emerging from his soot-mill, what is the first duty I will prescribe, and offer help towards? That he clean the skin of him. Can he pray, by any ascertained method? One knows not entirely:\u2014but with soap and a sufficiency of water, he can wash. Even the dull English feel something of this; they have a saying, \"Cleanliness is near of kin to Godliness:\"\u2014yet never, in any country, saw I operative men worse washed, and, in a climate drenched with the softest cloud-water, such a scarcity of baths!'\u2014Alas, Sauerteig, our 'operative men' are at present short even of potatoes: what 'duty' can you prescribe to them!\n\nOr let us give a glance at China. Our new friend, the Emperor there, is Pontiff of three hundred million men; who do all live and work, these many centuries now; authentically patronised by Heaven so far; and therefore must have some 'religion' of a kind. T his Emperor-Pontiff has, in fact, a religious belief of certain Laws of Heaven; observes, with a religious rigour, his 'three thousand punctualities,' given out by men of insight, some sixty generations since, as a legible transcript of the same,\u2014 the Heavens do seem to say, not totally an incorrect one. He has not much of a ritual, this Pontiff-Emperor; believes, it is likest, with the old Monks, that 'Labour is Worship.' His most public Act of Worship, it appears, is the drawing solemnly at a certain day, on the green bosom of our Mother Earth, when the Heavens, after dead black winter, have again with their vernal radiances awakened her, a distinct red Furrow with the Plough,\u2014 signal that all the Ploughs of China are to begin ploughing and worshipping! It is notable enough. He, in sight of the Seen and Unseen Powers, draws his distinct red Furrow there; saying, and praying, in mute symbolism, so many most eloquent things!\n\nIf you ask this Pontiff, \"Who made him? What is to become of him and us?\" he maintains a dignified reserve; waves his hand and pontiff-eyes over the unfathomable deep of Heaven, the 'Tsien,' the azure kingdoms of Infinitude; as if asking, \"is it doubtful that we are right well made? Can aught that is wrong become of us?\"\u2014He and his three hundred millions (it is their chief 'punctuality') visit yearly the Tombs of their Fathers; each man the Tomb of his Father and his Mother: alone there, in silence, with what of 'worship' or of other thought there may be, pauses solemnly each man; the divine Skies all silent over him; the divine Graves, and this divinest Grave, all silent under him; the pulsings of his own soul, if he have any soul, alone audible. Truly it may be a kind of worship! Truly, if a man cannot get some glimpse into the Eternities, looking through this portal,\u2014 through what other need he try it?\n\nOur friend the Pontiff-Emperor permits cheerfully, though with contempt, all manner of Buddhists, Bonzes, Talapoins and such like, to build brick Temples, on the voluntary principle; to worship with what of chantings, paper-lanterns and tumultuous brayings, pleases them; and make night hideous, since they find some comfort in so doing. Cheerfully, though with contempt. He is a wiser Pontiff than many persons think! He is as yet the one Chief Potentate or Priest in this Earth who has made a distinct systematic attempt at what we call the ultimate result of all religion, 'Practical Hero-worship:' he does incessantly, with true anxiety, in such way as he can, search and sift (it would appear) his whole enormous population for the Wisest born among them; by which Wisest, as by born Kings, these three hundred million men are governed. The Heavens, to a certain extent, do appear to countenance him. These three hundred millions actually make porcelain, souchong tea, with innumerable other things; and fight, under Heaven's flag, against Necessity;\u2014and have fewer Seven-Years Wars, Thirty-Years Wars, French-Revolution Wars, and infernal fightings with each other, than certain millions elsewhere have!\n\nNay, in our poor distracted Europe itself, in these newest times, have there not religious voices risen,\u2014with a religion new and yet the oldest; entirely indisputable to all hearts of men? Some I do know, who did not call or think themselves 'Prophets,' far enough from that; but who were, in very truth, melodious Voices from the eternal Heart of Nature once again; souls forever venerable to all that have a soul. A French Revolution is one phenomenon; as complement and spiritual exponent thereof, a Poet Goethe and German Literature is to me another. The old Secular or Practical World, so to speak, having gone up in fire, is not here the prophecy and dawn of a new Spiritual World, parent of far nobler, wider, new Practical Worlds? A Life of Antique devoutness, Antique veracity and heroism, has again become possible, is again seen actual there, for the most modern man. A phenomenon, as quiet as it is, comparable for greatness to no other! 'The great event for the world is, now as always, the arrival in it of a new Wise Man.' Touches there are, be the Heavens ever thanked, of new Sphere-melody; audible once more, in the infinite jargoning discords and poor scrannel- pipings of the thing called Literature;\u2014priceless there, as the voice of new Heavenly Psalms! Literature, like the old Prayer- Collections of the first centuries, were it 'well selected from and burnt,' contains precious things. For Literature, with all its printing-presses, puffing-engines and shoreless deafening triviality, is yet 'the Thought of Thinking Souls.' A sacred 'religion,' if you like the name, does live in the heart of that strange froth-ocean, not wholly froth, which we call Literature; and will more and more disclose itself therefrom;\u2014not now as scorching Fire: the red smoky scorching Fire has purified itself into white sunny Light. Is not Light grander than Fire? It is the same element in a state of purity.\n\nMy ingenuous readers, we will march out of this Third Book with a rhythmic word of Goethe's on our tongue; a word which perhaps has already sung itself, in dark hours and in bright, through many a heart. To me, finding it devout yet wholly credible and veritable, full of piety yet free of cant; to me joyfully finding much in it, and joyfully missing so much in it, this little snatch of music, by the greatest German Man, sounds like a stanza in the grand Road-Song and Marching-Song of our great Teutonic Kindred, wending, wending, valiant and victorious, through the undiscovered Deeps of Time! He calls it Mason- Lodge,\u2014not Psalm or Hymn:\n\nThe Mason's ways are\nA type of Existence,\nAnd his persistance\nIs as the days are\nOf men in this world.\n\nThe Future hides in it\nGood hap and sorrow;\nWe press still thorow,\nNought that abides in it\nDaunting us,\u2014onward.\nAnd solemn before us,\nVeiled, the dark Portal,\nGoal of all mortal:\u2014\nStars silent rest o'er us,\nGraves under us silent.\n\nWhile earnest thou gazest,\nComes boding of terror,\nComes phantasm and error,\nPerplexes the bravest\nWith doubt and misgiving.\n\nBut heard are the Voices,\u2014\nHeard are the Sages,\nThe Worlds and the Ages:\n\"Choose well, your choice is\nBrief and yet endless:\n\nHere eyes do regard you,\nIn Eternity's stilness;\nHere is all fulness,\nYe brave, to reward you;\nWork, and despair not.\"Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1469362", "artist_names": "Timi Yuro", "full_title": "Insult to Injury by\u00a0Timi\u00a0Yuro",

COPPOLA\n\nTHIRD DRAFT PARAMOUNT PICTURES\n1 Gulf and Western Plaza\nMarch 29, 1971 New York, New York 10019\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black\nBackground. There is a moment's hesitation, and then the\nSimple words in white lettering:\n\nTHE GODFATHER\n\nWhile this remains, we hear: \"I believe in America.\"\nSuddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a\nMan of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great\nEmotion.\n\nBONASERA\nAmerica has made my fortune.\n\nAs he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.\n\nBONASERA\nI raised my daughter in the American\nFashion; I gave her freedom, but\nTaught her never to dishonor her\nFamily. She found a boy friend,\nNot an Italian. She went to the\nMovies with him, stayed out late.\nTwo months ago he took her for a\nDrive, with another boy friend.\nThey made her drink whiskey and\nThen they tried to take advantage\nOf her. She resisted; she kept her\nHonor. So they beat her like an\nAnimal. When I went to the hospital\nHer nose was broken, her jaw was\nShattered and held together by\nWire, and she could not even weep\nBecause of the pain.\nHe can barely speak; he is weeping now.\n\nBONASERA\nI went to the Police like a good\nAmerican. These two boys were\nArrested and brought to trial. The\nJudge sentenced them to three years\nIn prison, and suspended the\nSentence. Suspended sentence!\nThey went free that very day. I\nStood in the courtroom like a fool,\nAnd those bastards, they smiled at\nMe. Then I said to my wife, for\nJustice, we must go to The Godfather.\n\nBy now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office\nIn his home.\n\nThe blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with\nPatterned shadows. We are watching BONASERA over the\nShoulder of DON CORLEONE. TOM HAGEN sits near a small\nTable, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands\nImpatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a\nGlass of wine. We can HEAR music, and the laughter and\nVoices of many people outside.\nDON CORLEONE\nBonasera, we know each other for\nYears, but this is the first time\nYou come to me for help. I don't\nRemember the last time you invited\nMe to your house for coffee...even\nThough our wives are friends.\n\nBONASERA\nWhat do you want of me? I'll give\nYou anything you want, but do what\nI ask!\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd what is that Bonasera?\n\nBONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo. You ask for too much.\n\nBONASERA\nI ask for Justice.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThe Court gave you justice.\n\nBONASERA\nAn eye for an eye!\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBut your daughter is still alive.\n\nBONASERA\nThen make them suffer as she\nSuffers. How much shall I pay you.\n\nBoth HAGEN and SONNY react.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou never think to protect yourself\nWith real friends. You think it's\nEnough to be an American. All\nRight, the Police protects you,\nThere are Courts of Law, so you\nDon't need a friend like me.\nBut now you come to me and say Don\nCorleone, you must give me justice.\nAnd you don't ask in respect or\nFriendship. And you don't think to\nCall me Godfather; instead you come\nTo my house on the day my daughter\nIs to be married and you ask me to\nDo murder...for money.\n\nBONASERA\nAmerica has been good to me...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThen take the justice from the\nJudge, the bitter with the sweet,\nBonasera. But if you come to me\nWith your friendship, your loyalty,\nThen your enemies become my enemies,\nAnd then, believe me, they would\nFear you...\n\nSlowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.\n\nBONASERA\nBe my friend.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGood. From me you'll get Justice.\n\nBONASERA\nGodfather.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nSome day, and that day may never\nCome, I would like to call upon you\nTo do me a service in return.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nA HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight. There\nAre at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard\nAnd gardens. There is music and laughing and dancing and\nCountless tables covered with food and wine.\n\nDON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a\nSon: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of\nThe wedding party. He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the\nHands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the\nChildren, and makes them all welcome. They in turn carry\nWith them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked\nBread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.\n\nThe entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,\nMAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN\nAnd his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the\nBride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI. As they move into\nThe pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhere's Michael?\n\nSONNY\nHe'll be here Pop, it's still early.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThen the picture will wait for him.\n\nEveryone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves\nBack to the house. SONNY gives a delicious smile in the\nDirection of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI. She returns\nIt. Then he moves to his wife.\n\nSONNY\nSandra, watch the kids. They're\nRunning wild.\n\nSANDRA\nYou watch yourself.\n\nHAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine\nBarrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait. TOM\nCrooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is\nNext, straightens, and follows HAGEN.\nEXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nOutside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,\nWorking together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out\nOf the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers\nDown in their notebooks. We HEAR the music and laughter\nComing from the party in the distance.\n\nA MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.\n\nBARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the\nWatchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to\nEmbrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.\n\nThe MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another\nNumber in the notebook. A shiney new Cadillac with wooden\nBumpers.\n\nPETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping\nBellies with the ladies.\n\nCLEMENZA\nPaulie...wine...WINE.\n\nHe mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.\nPAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings\nIt to him.\n\nPAULIE\nYou look terrif on the floor!\n\nCLEMENZA\nWhat are you, a dance judge? Go do\nYour job; take a walk around the\nNeighborhood... see everything is\nOkay.\n\nPAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps\nBack into the dance.\n\nThe MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another\nNumber in the notebook.\n\nTESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-\nOLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his\nEnormous brown shoes.\n\nThe MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out\nOf the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by\nCLEMENZA and PAULIE.\n\nSONNY\nBuddy, this is a private party.\n\nThe MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the\nSedan. SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.\nThe DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,\nWithout saying a word. SONNY steps back, spits on the\nGround, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,\nAnd another TWO MEN. He doesn't say a thing for most of the\nWalk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.\n\nSONNY\nGoddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the\nDark study.\n\nNAZORINE\n...a fine boy from Sicily, captured\nBy the American Army, and sent to\nNew Jersey as a prisoner of war...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNazorine, my friend, tell me what I\nCan do.\n\nNAZORINE\nNow that the war is over, Enzo,\nThis boy is being repatriated to\nItaly. And you see, Godfather...\n(he wrings his hands,\nUnable to express himself)\nHe...my daughter...they...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou want him to stay in this country.\n\nNAZORINE\nGodfather, you understand everything.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTom, what we need is an Act of\nCongress to allow Enzo to become a\nCitizen.\n\nNAZORINE\n(impressed)\nAn Act of Congress!\n\nHAGEN\n(nodding)\nIt will cost.\n\nThe DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE\nNods.\n\nNAZORINE\nIs that all? Godfather, thank\nYou...\n(backing out, enthusiastically)\nOh, wait till you see the cake I\nMade for your beautiful daughter!\n\nNAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.\nDON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.\n\nHAGEN\nWho do I give this job to?\n\nThe DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNot to one of our paisans...give it\nTo a Jew Congressman in another\nDistrict. Who else is on the list\nFor today?\n\nThe DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting\nTo see him.\n\nHAGEN\nFrancesco Nippi. His nephew has\nBeen refused parole. A bad case.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nNIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nHis father worked with you in the\nFreight yards when you were young.\n\nLUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nHe's not on the list, but Luca\nBrasi wants to see you.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe DON turns to HAGEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nIs it necessary?\n\nHAGEN\nYou understand him better than\nAnyone.\n\nThe DON nods to this. Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nMICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain,\nLeads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally\nStopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds,\nFollowing them.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces\nHer to his GIRL.\n\nEXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe DON's eyes peering through the blinds.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)\n\nKAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding,\nBurdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine. She\nIs exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and\nThe vitality.\n\nKAY\nI've never seen anything like it.\n\nMICHAEL\nI told you I had a lot of relatives.\n\nKAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.\nWe see what she sees:\n\nHer interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine\nBarrels.\n\nKAY\n(amused)\nMichael, what are those men doing?\n\nMICHAEL\nThey're waiting to see my father.\n\nKAY\nThey're talking to themselves.\n\nMICHAEL\nThey're going to talk to my father,\nWhich means they're going to ask\nHim for something, which means they\nBetter get it right.\n\nKAY\nWhy do they bother him on a day\nLike this?\n\nMICHAEL\nBecause they know that no Sicilian\nWill refuse a request on his\nDaughter's wedding day.\n\nEXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945)\n\nCONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her\nOverly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI. He\nIs bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.\nShe absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from\nHim long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white\nEnvelopes they are putting into the large white purse she\nHolds. In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one\nOf her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,\nWhere she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.\nCARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the\nBulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the\nThings hold.\n\nDiscreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.\n\nCARLO\n(whispered)\nCut it out, Connie.\n\nThe purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,\nIs fat with money.\n\nPAULIE (O.S.)\nWhat do you think? Twenty grand?\n\nA little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a\nProsciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking\nEyes from the purse.\n\nPAULIE\nWho knows? Maybe more. Twenty,\nThirty grand in small bills cash in\nThat silk purse. Holy Toledo, if\nThis was somebody else's wedding!\n\nSONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY\nMANCINI, the Maid of Honor. Every once in a while he\nGlances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with\nSome WOMEN.\n\nHe bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.\n\nSANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.\n\nWOMAN\nIs it true what they say about your\nHusband, Sandra?\n\nSANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and\nFurther apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.\nThrough her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.\nSONNY and LUCY are gone.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe empty hallway. The bathroom door opens and LUCY\nSurreptitiously steps out.\n\nShe looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing,\nMotioning for her to come up.\n\nShe lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)\n\nKAY and MICHAEL.\n\nKAY\n(in a spooky low tone)\nMichael, that scarey guy...Is he a\nRelative?\n\nShe has picked out LUCA BRASI.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. His name is Luca Brasi. You\nWouldn't like him.\n\nKAY\n(Excited)\nWho is he?\n\nMICHAEL\n(Sizing her up)\nYou really want to know?\n\nKAY\nYes. Tell me.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou like spaghetti?\n\nKAY\nYou know I love spaghetti.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen eat your spaghetti and I'll\nTell you a Luca Brasi story.\n\nShe starts to eat her spaghetti.\n\nShe begins eating, looking at him eagerly.\n\nMICHAEL\nOnce upon a time, about fifteen\nYears ago some people wanted to\nTake over my father's olive oil\nBusiness. They had Al Capone send\nSome men in from Chicago to kill my\nFather, and they almost did.\n\nKAY\nAl Capone!\n\nMICHAEL\nMy Father sent Luca Brasi after\nThem. He tied the two Capone men\nHand and foot, and stuffed small\nBath towels into their mouths.\nThen he took an ax, and chopped one\nMan's feet off...\n\nKAY\nMichael...\n\nMICHAEL\nThen the legs at the knees...\n\nKAY\nMichael you're trying to scare me...\n\nMICHAEL\nThen the thighs where they joined\nThe torso.\n\nKAY\nMichael, I don't want to hear\nAnymore...\n\nMICHAEL\nThen Luca turned to the other man...\n\nKAY\nMichael, I love you.\n\nMICHAEL\n...who out of sheer terror had\nSwallowed the bath towel in his\nMouth and suffocated.\n\nThe smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a\nTall story.\n\nKAY\nI never know when you're telling me\nThe truth.\n\nMICHAEL\nI told you you wouldn't like him.\n\nKAY\nHe's coming over here!\n\nLUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near\nTheir table.\n\nMICHAEL\nTom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay\nAdams.\n\nKAY\n(having survived LUCA)\nHow do you do.\n\nMICHAEL\nMy brother, Tom Hagen.\n\nHAGEN\nHello Kay. Your father's inside,\nDoing some business.\n(privately)\nHe's been asking for you.\n\nMICHAEL\nThanks Tom.\n\nHAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously\nFollowing.\n\nKAY\nIf he's your brother, why does he\nHave a different name?\n\nMICHAEL\nMy brother Sonny found him living\nIn the streets when he was a kid,\nSo my father took him in. He's a\nGood lawyer.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE at the window. He has seen the intimacy of the\nYOUNG COUPLE.\n\nLUCA (O.S.)\nDon Corleone...\n\nTHE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves\nForward to kiss his hand. He takes the envelope from his\nJacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes\nA formal speech.\n\nLUCA\n(with difficulty)\nDon Corleone...I am honored, and\nGrateful...that you invited me to\nYour home...on the wedding day of\nYour...daughter.\nMay their first child...be a\nMasculine child. I pledge my never\nEnding loyalty.\n(he offers the envelope)\nFor your daughter's bridal purse.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThank you, Luca, my most valued\nFriend.\n\nTHE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so\nTightly we might imagine it to be painful.\n\nLUCA\nLet me leave you, Don Corleone. I\nKnow you are busy.\n\nHe turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with\nThe same formality he entered with. DON CORLEONE breathes\nMore easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI'm sure it's the most generous\nGift today.\n\nHAGEN\nThe Senator called--apologized for\nNot coming personally, but said\nYou'd understand. Also, some of\nThe Judges...they've all sent gifts.\nAnd another call from Virgil\nSollozzo.\n\nDON CORLEONE is not pleased.\n\nHAGEN\nThe action is narcotics. Sollozzo\nHas contacts in Turkey for the\nPoppy, in Sicily for the plants to\nProcess down to morphine or up to\nHeroin. Also he has access to this\nCountry. He's coming to us for\nFinancial help, and some sort of\nImmunity from the law. For that we\nGet a piece of the action, I\nCouldn't find out how much.\nSollozzo is vouched for by the\nTattaglia family, and they may have\nA piece of the action. They call\nSollozzo the Turk.\nHe's spent a lot of time in Turkey\nAnd is suppose to have a Turkish\nWife and kids. He's suppose to be\nVery quick with the knife, or was,\nWhen he was younger. Only in\nMatters of business and with some\nReasonable complaint. Also he has\nAn American wife and three children\nAnd he is a good family man.\n\nTHE DON nods.\n\nHAGEN\nHe's his own boss, and very\nCompetent.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd with prison record.\n\nHAGEN\nTwo terms; one in Italy, one in the\nUnited States. He's known to the\nGovernment as a top narcotics man.\nThat could be a plus for us; he\nCould never get immunity to testify.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhen did he call?\n\nHAGEN\nThis morning.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nOn a day like this. Consiglero, do\nYou also have in your notes the the\nTurk made his living from\nProstitution before the war, like\nThe Tattaglias do now. Write that\nDown before you forget it. The\nTurk will wait.\n\nWe now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers\nFrom outside. In Italian, with unmistakable style.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat that? It sounds like Johnny.\n\nHe moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the\nRoom with light.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nIt is Johnny. He came all the way\nFrom California to be at the wedding.\n\nHAGEN\nShould I bring him in.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo. Let the people enjoy him. You\nSee? He is a good godson.\n\nHAGEN\nIt's been two years. He's probably\nIn trouble again.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nJOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and\nExcitement of the wedding GUESTS.\n\nKAY\nI didn't know your family knew\nJohnny Fontane.\n\nMICHAEL\nSure.\n\nKAY\nI used to come down to New York\nWhenever he sang at the Capitol and\nScream my head off.\n\nMICHAEL\nHe's my father's godson; he owes\nHim his whole career.\n\nJOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.\nThey call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMy Godson has come three thousand\nMiles to do us honor and no one\nThinks to wet his throat.\n\nAt once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who\nTakes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.\n\nJOHNNY\nI kept trying to call you after my\nDivorce and Tom always said you\nWere busy. When I got the Wedding\nInvitation I knew you weren't sore\nAt me anymore, Godfather.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nCan I do something for you still?\nYou're not too rich, or too famous\nThat I can't help you?\n\nJOHNNY\nI'm not rich anymore, Godfather,\nAnd...my career, I'm almost washed\nUp...\n\nHe's very disturbed. The GODFATHER indicates that he come\nWith him to the office so no one will notice. He turns to\nHAGEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTell Santino to come in with us.\nHe should hear some things.\n\nThey go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nHAGEN glances up the staircase.\n\nHAGEN\nSonny?\n\nThen he goes up.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\nSONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her\nGown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing\nAgainst the door. Her face peeks out from the layers of\nPetticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.\n\nLUCY\nSonnyeeeeeeee.\n\nHer head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his\nBody. But there is a knocking as well. They stop, freeze\nIn that position.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nSonny? Sonny, you in there?\n\nINT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)\n\nOutside, HAGEN by the door.\n\nHAGEN\nThe old man wants you; Johnny's\nHere...he's got a problem.\n\nSONNY (O.S.)\nOkay. One minute.\n\nHAGEN hesitates. We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the\nDoor again. TOM leaves.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE\nACT LIKE A MAN! By Christ in\nHeaven, is it possible you turned\nOut no better than a Hollywood\nFinocchio.\n\nBoth HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing. The DON\nSmiles. SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still\nAdjusting his clothes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAll right, Hollywood...Now tell me\nAbout this Hollywood Pezzonovanta\nWho won't let you work.\n\nJOHNNY\nHe owns the studio. Just a month\nAgo he bought the movie rights to\nThis book, a best seller. And the\nMain character is a guy just like\nMe. I wouldn't even have to act,\nJust be myself.\n\nThe DON is silent, stern.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou take care of your family?\n\nJOHNNY\nSure.\n\nHe glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as\nHe can.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou look terrible. I want you to\nEat well, to rest. And spend time\nWith your family. And then, at the\nEnd of the month, this big shot\nWill give you the part you want.\n\nJOHNNY\nIt's too late. All the contracts\nHave been signed, they're almost\nReady to shoot.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI'll make him an offer he can't refuse.\n\nHe takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough\nTo hurt.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNow go back to the party and leave\nIt to me.\n\nHe closes the door, smiling to himself. Turns to HAGEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhen does my daughter leave with\nHer bridegroom?\n\nHAGEN\nThey'll cut the cake in a few\nMinutes...leave right after that.\nYour new son-in-law, do we give him\nSomething important?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo, give him a living. But never\nLet him know the family's business.\nWhat else, Tom?\n\nHAGEN\nI've called the hospital; they've\nNotified Consiglere Genco's family\nTo come and wait. He won't last\nOut the night.\n\nThis saddens the DON. He sighs.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGenco will wait for me. Santino,\nTell your brothers they will come\nWith me to the hospital to see\nGenco. Tell Fredo to drive the big\nCar, and ask Johnny to come with us.\n\nSONNY\nAnd Michael?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAll my sons.\n(to HAGEN)\nTom, I want you to go to California\nTonight. Make the arrangements.\nBut don't leave until I come back\nFrom the hospital and speak to you.\nUnderstood?\n\nHAGEN\nUnderstood.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nNow all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over\nThe entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels\nIn a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most\nExtravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument\nOf his gratitude. The CROWD is favorably impressed: they\nBegin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,\nIn the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and\nKiss the Groom. Louder and louder, five hundred forks\nHitting five hundred glasses.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nSilence.\n\nHIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day. The GUESTS are gone. A\nSingle black car is in the courtyard. FREDDIE is behind the\nDriver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who\nSits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWill your girl friend get back to\nThe city all right?\n\nMICHAEL\nTom said he'd take care of it.\n\nThe DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through\nThe gate of the great Corleone Mall.\n\nINT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)\n\nA long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can\nSee a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but\nAll plump and dressed in black.\n\nDON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end. But then the\nDON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder. MICHAEL\nStops and turns toward his FATHER. The two looks at one\nAnother for some time. SILENCE. DON CORLEONE then lifts\nHis hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's\nUniform.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat was this for?\n\nMICHAEL\nFor bravery.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd this?\n\nMICHAEL\nFor killing a man.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat miracles you do for strangers.\n\nMICHAEL\nI fought for my country. It was my\nChoice.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd now, what do you choose to do?\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm going to finish school.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGood. When you are finished, come\nAnd talk to me. I have hopes for\nYou.\n\nAgain they regard each other without a word. MICHAEL turns,\nAnd continues on. DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then\nFollows.\n\nINT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR\nVIEW. He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\n(whispered)\nGenco, I've brought my sons to pay\nTheir respects. And look, even\nJohnny Fontane, all the way from\nHollywood.\n\nGENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man. DON CORLEONE\nTakes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around\nHis bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.\n\nGENCO\nGodfather, Godfather, it's your\nDaughter's wedding day, you cannot\nRefuse me. Cure me, you have the\nPower.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI have no such power...but Genco,\nDon't fear death.\n\nGENCO\n(with a sly wink)\nIt's been arranged, then?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou blaspheme. Resign yourself.\n\nGENCO\nYou need your old Consigliere. Who\nWill replace me?\n(suddenly)\nStay with me Godfather. Help me\nMeet death. If he sees you, he\nWill be frightened and leave me in\nPeace. You can say a word, pull a\nFew strings, eh? We'll outwit that\nBastard as we outwitted all those\nOthers.\n(clutching his hand)\nGodfather, don't betray me.\n\nThe DON motions all the others to leave the room. They do.\nHe returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and\nWhispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.\n\nINT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nFADE IN:\n\nThe interior of a non-stop Constellation. HAGEN is one of\nThe very few passengers on this late flight. He looks like\nAny young lawyer on a business trip. He is tired from the\nDifficult preparation and duties that he has just executed\nDuring the wedding. On the seat next to him is an enormous,\nBulging briefcase. He closes his eyes.\n\nINT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE. CARLO is in his\nUndershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the\nEnvelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the\nContents. CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble\nBathroom. She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and\nTries to get his interest.\n\nINT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE in his office. LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nLuca, I am worried about this man\nSollozzo. Find out what you can,\nThrough the Tattaglias. Let them\nBelieve you could be tempted away\nFrom the Corleone Family, if the\nRight offer was made. Learn what\nHe has under his fingernails...\n\nINT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe hallway of an apartment building. SONNY enters, climbs\nTwo steps at a time. He knocks, and then whispers.\n\nSONNY\nIt's me, Sonny.\n\nThe door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling\nHim into the apartment.\n\nINT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA BRASI's tiny room. He is partly dressed. He kneels\nAnd reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked\nTrunk. He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof\nVest. He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then\nPuts on his shirt and jacket. He takes his gun, quickly\nDisassembles, checks, and reassembles it. And leaves.\n\nINT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nA CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.\n\nINT NIGHT: MOVING TRAIN (SUMMER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New\nHampshire.\n\nINT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty\nSubway train.\n\nINT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nHAGEN on the Constellation. He reaches into his briefcase,\nAnd takes out several pictures and papers.\n\nOne photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm\nIn arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a\nLovely young child star to his immediate right.\n\nHAGEN considers other papers.\n\nINT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.\nHe straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nRemember my new Consigliere, a\nLawyer with his briefcase can steal\nMore than a hundred men with guns.\n\nEXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nJACK WOLTZ ESTATE. HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,\nArmed only with his briefcase. A GATEMAN opens the gate,\nAnd TOM enters.\n\nEXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)\n\nHAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal\nGardens, martinis in hand.\n\nWOLTZ\nYou should have told me your boss\nWas Corleone, Tom, I had to check\nYou out. I thought you were just\nSome third rate hustler Johnny was\nRunning in to bluff me.\n(a piece of statuary)\nFlorence, thirteenth century.\nDecorated the garden of a king.\n\nThey cross the garden and head toward the stables.\n\nWOLTZ\nI'm going to show you something\nBeautiful.\n\nThey pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a\nHuge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: \"KHARTOUM.\"\nTWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they\nRise as WOLTZ approaches.\n\nWOLTZ\nYou like horses? I like horses, I\nLove 'em. Beautiful, expensive\nRacehorses.\n\nThe animal inside is truly beautiful. WOLTZ whispers to him\nWith true love in his voice.\n\nWOLTZ\nKhartoum...Kartoum...You are\nLooking at six hundred thousand\nDollars on four hoofs. I bet even\nRussian Czars never paid that kind\nOf dough for a single horse. But\nI'm not going to race him I'm going\nTo put him out to Stud.\n\nINT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\nHAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,\nAttended by SEVERAL SERVANTS. Great paintings hang on the\nWalls. The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.\n\nHAGEN\nMr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.\nThat is very close, a very sacred\nReligious relationship.\n\nWOLTZ\nOkay, but just tell him this is one\nFavor I can't give. But he should\nTry me again on anything else.\n\nHAGEN\nHe never asks a second favor when\nHe has been refused the first.\nUnderstood?\n\nWOLTZ\nYou smooth son of a bitch, let me\nLay it on the line for you, and\nYour boss. Johnny Fontane never\nGets that movie. I don't care how\nMany Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball\nGoombahs come out of the woodwork!\n\nHAGEN\nI'm German-Irish.\n\nWOLTZ\nOkay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny\nWill never get that part because I\nHate that pinko punk and I'm going\nTo run him out of the Movies. And\nI'll tell you why. He ruined one\nOf Woltz Brothers' most valuable\nProteges. For five years I had\nThis girl under training; singing\nLessons! Acting lessons! Dancing\nLessons! We spent hundreds of\nThousands of dollars--I was going\nTo make her a star. I'll be even\nMore frank, just to show you that\nI'm not a hard-hearted man, that it\nWasn't all dollars and cents. That\nGirl was beautiful and young and\nInnocent and she was the greatest\nPiece of ass I've ever ad and I've\nHad them all over the world. Then\nJohnny comes along with that olive\nOil voice and guinea charm and she\nRuns off. She threw it all away to\nMake me look ridiculous. A MAN IN\nMY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE\nMADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!\n\nEXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)\n\nAn unimposing little building in New York City on Mott\nStreet with a large old sign: \"GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,\nINC.\" next to an open-faced fruit market.\n\nA dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we\nCannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters\nThe building. This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.\n\nINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)\n\nLooking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps\nBefore he actually rises into view. He is a small man, very\nDark, with curly black hair. But wiry, and tight and hard,\nAnd obviously very dangerous. He is greeted at the head of\nThe stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,\nIntroducing himself. For a moment, there is a complex of\nHandshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful\nIntroductions. Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's\nGlass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.\nThey are very respectful of one another. Folding chairs are\nBrought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around\nIn a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,\nCLEMENZA and TESSIO. The DON is the slightest bit foolish\nWith all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no\nOne. Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear\nThat this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nMy business is heroin, I have poppy\nFields, laboratories in Narseilles\nAnd Sicily, ready to go into\nProduction. My importing methods\nAre as safe as these things can be,\nAbout five per cent loss. The risk\nIs nothing, the profits enormous.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhy do you come to me? Why do I\nDeserve your generosity?\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI need two million dollars in\nCash...more important, I need a\nFriend who has people in high\nPlaces; a friend who can guarantee\nThat if one of my employees be\nArrested, they would get only light\nSentences. Be my friend.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat percentages for my family?\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThirty per cent. In the first year\nYour share would be four million\nDollars; then it would go up.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd what is the percentage of the\nTattaglia family?\n\nSOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nMy compliments. I'll take care of\nThem from my share.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nSo. I receive 30 per cent just for\nFinance and legal protection. No\nWorries about operations, is that\nWhat you tell me?\n\nSOLLOZZO\nIf you think two million dollars in\nCash is just finance, I congratulate\nYou Don Corleone.\n\nThere is a long silence; in which each person present feels\nThe tension. The DON is about to give his answer.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI said I would see you because I've\nHeard you're a serious man, to be\nTreated with respect...\n(pause)\nBut I'll say no to you.\n\nWe feel this around the room.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI'll give you my reasons. I have\nMany, many friends in Politics.\nBut they wouldn't be so friendly if\nMy business was narcotics instead\nOf gambling. They think gambling\nIs something like liquor, a harmless\nVice...and they think narcotics is\nDirty business.\n\nSOLLOZZO takes a breath.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo...how a man makes his living is\nNone of my business. But this\nProposition of yours is too risky.\nAll the people in my family lived\nWell the last ten years, I won't\nRisk that out of greed.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nAre you worried about security for\nYour million?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThe Tattaglias will guarantee your\nInvestment also.\n\nThis startles SONNY; he blurts out.\n\nSONNY\nThe Tattaglia family guarantees our\nInvestment?\n\nSOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face\nHim. Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out\nOf line.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYoung people are greedy, and they\nHave no manners. They speak when\nThey should listen. But I have a\nSentimental weakness for my\nChildren, and I've spoiled them, as\nYou see. But Signor Sollozzo, my\nNo is final.\n\nSOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal. He\nGlances one last time at SONNY. He rises; all the others do\nAs well. He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally\nTakes his leave. When the footsteps can no longer be heard:\n\nThe DON turns to SONNY.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nSantino, never let anyone outside\nThe family know what you are\nThinking. I think your brain is\nGoing soft from all that comedy you\nPlay with that young girl.\n\nTWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display\nWith the word \"THANK YOU\" spelled out in flowers.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat is this nonsense?\n\nHAGEN\nIt's from Johnny. It was announced\nThis morning. He's going to play\nThe lead in the new Woltz Brothers\nFilm.\n\nINT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\nIt is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,\nPresumably WOLTZ, is sleeping. Soft light bathes the room\nFrom the large windows. We move closer to him until we see\nHis face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ. He turns uncomfortably;\nMutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets. Something\nWet.\n\nHe wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.\nHe looks at his hand; the wetness is blood. He is\nFrightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on\nHis sheets and pajamas. He grunts, pulls the puddle of\nBlood in his bed. He feels his own body frantically,\nMoving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face\nWith the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of\nHis bed. Just blood from the hacked neck. White reedy\nTendons show. He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle\nOf blood to see more clearly. Froth covers the muzzle, and\nThe enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered\nWith blood.\n\nWOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot. No sound comes out.\nThen, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure\nTerror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and\nKnees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.\n\nINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)\n\nCLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER. Nodding.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nSend Johnny my congratulations.\n\n----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------\n\n(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED)\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945)\n\nFifth Avenue in the snow. Christmas week. People are\nBundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents.\n\nKAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store,\nCarrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.\n\nKAY\nWe have something for your mother,\nFor Sonny, we have the tie for\nFredo and Tom Hagen gets the\nReynolds pen...\n\nMICHAEL\nAnd what do you want for Christmas?\n\nKAY\nJust you.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nINT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music. THE VIEW PANS\nAROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nWe'll have a quiet, civil ceremony\nAt the City Hall, no big fuss, no\nFamily, just a couple of friends as\nWitnesses.\n\nThe two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on\nThe two single beds that they have pushed together.\n\nKAY\nWhat will your father say?\n\nMICHAEL\nAs long as I tell him beforehand he\nWon't object. He'll be hurt, but\nHe won't object.\n\nKAY\nWhat time do they expect us?\n\nMICHAEL\nFor dinner. Unless I call and tell\nThem we're still in New Hampshire.\n\nKAY\nMichael.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen we can have dinner, see a\nShow, and spend one more night.\n\nHe moves to the telephone.\n\nMICHAEL (CONT'D.)\nOperator. Get me\n(fill in number)\n\nKAY\nMichael, what are you doing?\n\nMICHAEL\nShhh, you be the long distance\nOperator. Here.\n\nKAY\nHello...this is Long Distance. I\nHave a call from New Hampshire. Mr.\nMichael Corleone. One moment please.\n\nShe hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.\n\nMICHAEL\nHello, Tom? Michael. Yeah...\nListen, we haven't left yet. I'm\nDriving down to the city with Kay\nTomorrow morning. There's something\nImportant I want to tell the old\nMan before Christmas. Will he be\nHome tomorrow night?\n\nINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nHAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office. In the background,\nThrough the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in\nHis office. TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nSure. Anything I can do for you.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nNo. I guess I'll see you Christmas.\nEveryone's going to be out at Long\nBeach, right?\n\nHAGEN\nRight.\n\nHe smiles. MICHAEL has hung up. He looks at the piles of\nWork, and can't face it. He rises, puts on his coat and\nHat, and continues out.\n\nHe peeks into the DON's office.\n\nHAGEN\nMichael called; he's not leaving\nNew Hampshire until tomorrow\nMorning. I've got to go, I promised\nTheresa I'd pick up some toys for\nThe kids.\n\nThe DON smiles and nods.\n\nTOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.\nFREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the\nAfternoon paper. He puts aside the papers the office\nManager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE,\nRaps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the\nPaper.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTell Paulie to get the car from the\nLot; I'll be ready to go home in a\nFew minutes.\n\nFREDO\nI'll have to get it myself; Paulie\nCalled in sick this morning.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThat's the third time this month.\nI think maybe you'd better get a\nHealthier bodyguard for me. Tell\nTom.\n\nFREDO\n(going)\nPaulie's a good kid. If he's sick,\nHe's sick. I don't mind getting\nThe car.\n\nFREDDIE leaves. He slowly puts on his jacket. Looks out\nHis window.\n\nEXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)\n\nFREDDIE crosses the street.\n\nINT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nOFFICE MANAGER\nBuon Watale, Don Corleone.\n\nThe MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat. Once again, the\nDON glances out his window.\n\nThe black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMerry Christmas.\n(handing the MANAGER\nAn envelope)\n\nAnd he starts down the stairs.\n\nEXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail. When\nFREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the\nDriver's seat. The DON moves to the car, and is about to\nGet in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open\nFruit stand near the corner.\n\nThe PROPRIETOR springs to serve him. The DON walks among\nThe trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular\nPiece of fruit. As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the\nPieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag. The DON\nPays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then\nTurns back to the car.\n\nEXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945)\n\nTOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift\nWrapped. He continues past the windows. As he walks,\nSomeone walks right in his way. He looks up. It is SOLLOZZO.\n\nHe takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(quietly)\nDon't be frightened. I just want\nTo talk to you.\n\nA car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(urgently)\nGet in; I want to talk to you.\n\nHAGEN pulls his arm free. He is frightened.\n\nHAGEN\nI haven't got time.\n\nTWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nGet in the car. If I wanted to\nKill you you'd be dead already.\nTrust me.\n\nHAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving\nOur VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story\nOf Hansel and Gretel. We HEAR the car doors shut, and the\nCar drive off.\n\nEXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945)\n\nRADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show. KAY and\nMICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and\nShe sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex. KAY\nNostalgically hums \"The Bells of Saint Mary's,\" as they walk\nArm in arm.\n\nKAY\nWould you like me better if I were\nA nun?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo.\n\nKAY\nWould you like me better if I were\nIngrid Bergman?\n\nThey have passed a little enclosed newsstand. KAY sees\nSomething that terrifies her. She doesn't know what to do.\nMICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.\n\nKAY\n(a little voice)\nMichael?\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm thinking about it.\n\nKAY\nMichael...\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, I would not like you better if\nYou were Ingrid Bergman.\n\nShe cannot answer him. Rather she pulls him by the arm,\nBack to the newsstand, and points. His face goes grave.\n\nThe headlines read: \"VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED\nDOWN.\"\n\nMICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a\nDollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them. KAY\nKnows to remain silent.\n\nMICHAEL\n(desperately)\nThey don't say if he's dead or alive.\n\nEXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the\nCar, when TWO MEN step from the corner. Suddenly, the DON\nDrops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness\nToward the parked car.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nFredo, Fredo!\n\nThe paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins\nRolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.\n\nFive bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain,\nAnd continues toward the car.\n\nThe PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking\nOver an entire case of fruit.\n\nThe TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.\n\nTheir feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit. There are\nMore GUNSHOTS.\n\nFREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car;\nHaving difficulty opening the door. He rushes out, a gun\nTrembling in his hand; his mouth open. He actually drops\nThe gun.\n\nThe gun falls amid the rolling fruit.\n\nThe GUNMEN are panicked. They fire once more at the downed\nDON CORLEONE. His leg and arm twitch where they are hit;\nAnd pools of blood are beginning to form.\n\nThe GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion;\nThey disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.\n\nThe PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared:\nRather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely\nFrom around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from\nWindows. But the street itself is now empty.\n\nFREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great\nPuddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and\nFace down in them.\n\nFREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying\nSomething we cannot understand. He begins to weep profusely.\n\nINT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night. He\nGets off.\n\nHe emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.\n\nEXT NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA walks down the late night street. He approaches an\nElegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still\nWinking this late at night. He waits and watches. Then the\nSign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.\n\nINT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless\nGlistening wooden floors. Now, at this late time, the\nChairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR\nIs waxing them. A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her\nReceipts. LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at\nThe bar. ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves\nBehind the bar.\n\nMAN\nLuca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.\n\nLUCA\nI know.\n\nLUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nDo you know who I am?\n\nLUCA Nods.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nYou've been talking to the\nTattaglias. They thought we could\nDo business.\n\nLUCA listens.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI need somebody strong to protect\nMy operation, physically. I've\nHeard you're not happy with your\nFamily, you might make a switch.\n\nLUCA\nIf the money is good enough.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nOn the first shipment, I can\nGuarantee you fifty thousand dollars.\n\nLUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.\n\nSOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,\nRather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.\nBRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter\nMagically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette. Then,\nHe does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and\nPuts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.\n\nINT NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe telephone in SONNY's house is ringing. He approaches\nIt, obviously fresh from a nap.\n\nSONNY\nYeah.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nDo you recognize my voice?\n\nSONNY\nI think so. Detective squad?\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nRight. Don't say my name, just\nListen. Somebody shot your father\nOutside his place fifteen minutes\nAgo.\n\nSONNY\nIs he alive?\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nI think so, but I can't get close\nEnough. There's a lot of blood.\nI'll try to find out more.\n\nSONNY\nFind out anything you can...you got\nA Grand coming.\n(click)\n\nSONNY cradles the phone. An incredible rage builds up in\nHim, his face actually turning red. He would like to rip\nThe phone to pieces in his bare hands. Then he controls it.\nQuickly, he dials another number.\n\nSONNY\nTheresa, let me talk to Tom. Not\nYet? Have him call me as soon as\nHe gets home.\n\nHe hangs up.\n\nSANDRA (O.S.)\nSonny? Sonny, who is it?\n(she enters the room)\nWhat is it?\n\nSONNY\n(calmly)\nThey shot the old man.\n\nSANDRA\nOh God...\n\nSONNY\nHoney...don't worry. Nothing else\nIs going to happen.\n\nThere is a POUNDING on the door. A BABY starts crying.\n\nSANDRA\n(really frightened)\nSONNY?\n\nSONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and\nMoves quickly. He opens the front door quickly. It is\nCLEMENZA. He enters, SONNY closes the door. SANDRA goes to\nLook after the baby.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(excited)\nYou heard about your father?\n\nSONNY\nYeah.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThe word is out in the streets that\nHe's dead.\n\nSONNY\nWhere the hell was Paulie, why\nWasn't he with the Don?\n\nCLEMENZA\nPaulie's been a little sick all\nWinter...he was home.\n\nSONNY\nHow many times did he stay home the\nLast couple of months?\n\nCLEMENZA\nMaybe three, four times. I always\nAsked Freddie if he wanted another\nBodyguard, but he said no. Things\nHave been so smooth the last ten\nYears...\n\nSONNY\nGo get Paulie, I don't care how\nSick he is. Pick him up yourself,\nAnd bring him to my father's house.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThat's all? Don't you want me to\nSend some people over here?\n\nSONNY\nNo, just you and Paulie.\n\nCLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the\nCouch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.\n\nSONNY\nA couple of our people will come to\nStay here. Do whatever they say;\nI'm going over to the main house.\nIf you want me, use Pop's special\nPhone.\n\nThe telephone rings again. SONNY answers it.\n\nSONNY\nHello.\n\nSOLLOZZO (O.S.)\nSantino Corleone?\n\nSANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is. SONNY\nIndicates that she be quiet.\n\nSONNY\nYeah.\n\nSOLLOZZO (O.S.)\nWe have Tom Hagen. In about three\nHours he'll be released with our\nProposition. Don't do anything\nUntil you've heard what he has to\nSay. You can only cause a lot of\nTrouble. What's done is done.\n(a pause)\nDon't lose that famous temper of\nYours.\n\nSONNY\n(quietly)\nI'll wait.\n\nEXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nFULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL. It is night, but the\nCourtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the\nTops of all the houses. It is very cold. We see the figure\nOf SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)\n\nSONNY walks into the empty, darkened house. Then he calls\nOut.\n\nSONNY\nMa? Ma, where are you.\n\nThe kitchen door swings open. He moves quickly and takes\nHer by the arm. He is deliberately calm.\n\nSONNY\nMa, I just got a call. Pop's\nHurt...I don't know how bad.\n\nMAMA\n(quietly)\nSantino? Have they killed him?\n\nSONNY\n(almost in tears)\nWe don't know yet, Ma.\n\nMAMA\nI'll get dressed. In case we can\nSee him...\n\nShe moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs. SONNY\nTurns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying. He\nTakes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil,\nAnd sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his\nFather's office.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nHe switches the lights on in the DON's office. The massive\nDesk dominates the room. SONNY moves quickly to the\nTelephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk,\nAnd dials a number.\n\nSONNY\nTessio...This is Santino Corleone.\nI want fifty reliable men out here.\n\nTESSIO (O.S.)\nI heard, Sonny...but what about\nClemenza's regime?\n\nSONNY\nI don't want to use Clemenza's\nPeople right now. Understood?\n\nHe hangs up. He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the\nDial, and removes a small notebook. He takes it back to the\nDesk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.\nWe follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA\nBRASI. SONNY dials the number. There is no answer.\n\nSONNY\nLuca.\n\nINT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe interior of an abandoned building. SEVERAL MEN in suits\nAnd ties sit around in the booths.\n\nHAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI know you're not in the muscle end\nOf the family--so I don't want you\nTo be afraid. I want you to help\nThe Corleones and I want you to\nHelp me.\n\nHAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette\nIn his mouth. ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye\nTo the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered\nChina cup. HAGEN sips gratefully.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nYour boss is dead...\n\nHAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.\nSOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(pushing the bottle)\nHave some more. We got him outside\nHis office, just before I picked\nYou up. You have to make the peace\nBetween me and Santino.\n\nHAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nSonny was hot for my deal, right?\nYou know it's the smart thing to\nDo, too. I want you to talk Sonny\nInto it.\n\nHAGEN\n(pulling himself together)\nSonny will come after you with\nEverything he's got.\n\nSOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThat's going to be his first\nReaction. You have to talk some\nSense into him. The Tattaglia\nFamily stands behind me with all\nTheir people. The other New York\nFamilies will go along with anything\nThat prevents a full scale war.\n\nHe leans close to HAGEN.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThe Don was slipping; in the old\nDays I could never have gotten to\nHim. Now he's dead, nothing can\nBring him back. Talk to Sonny,\nTalk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza\nAnd Tessio...it's good business.\n\nHAGEN\nEven Sonny won't be able to call\nOff Luca Brasi.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI'll worry about Luca. You take\nCare of Sonny and the other two kids.\n\nHAGEN\nI'll try...It's what the Don would\nWant us to do.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(lifting his hands in\nAn expression of harmlessness)\nGood...then you can go...\n(he escorts him to\nThe door)\nI don't like violence. I'm a\nBusinessman, and blood is a big\nExpense.\n\nHe opens the door; they step out together.\n\nEXT NITE: BUILDING\n\nHAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.\n\nBut a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.\nHe indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to\nSOLLOZZO in private.\n\nThen SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression. He opens the\nDoor, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThe old man is still alive. Five\nBullets in his Sicilian hide and\nHe's still alive.\n(he gives a fatalistic\nShrug)\nBad luck for me, bad luck for you.\n\nEXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL driving during the night. There is a little fog in\nThe air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making\nIt difficult to see well. The wipers move across the view,\nAs the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still\nDecorated for Christmas. The courtyard is bathed with white\nFloodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look. The\nNarrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link\nChain. There are strange cars parked along the curving\nCement walk. SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and\nChain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.\n\nMAN\nWho're you?\n\nANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and\nThen turns.\n\nMAN 2\nIt's the Don's kid; take the car,\nI'll bring him inside.\n\nThe FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.\n\nINT NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL\nDoesn't recognize. They pay little attention to him. Most\nOf them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas\nTree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.\n\nTHERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a\nCigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water\nGlass half filled with whiskey. On the other side of the\nSofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is\nSweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black\nWith his saliva. PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the\nOther side of the room. CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at\nHim.\n\nCLEMENZA\nYour mother's at the hospital with\nThe old man: He's gonna pull through.\n\nMICHAEL nods his relief.\n\nMICHAEL\nThanks.\n\nHe moves to THERESA.\n\nMICHAEL\n(gently)\nYou heard from Tom yet?\n\nWithout looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and\nTrembles. Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the\nRoom; everyone speaks in a whisper.\n\nMICHAEL\n(taking her hand)\nC'mon.\n\nHe leads her into his father's office without knocking.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nSONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad. They look\nUp, startled.\n\nSONNY\nDon't worry, Theresa; they just\nWant to give Tom the proposition,\nThen they're going to turn him loose.\n\nHe reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise,\nHe kisses him on the cheek.\n\nSONNY\nI was worried when we couldn't get\nIn touch with you in that hick town.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow's Mom?\n\nSONNY\nGood. She's been through it before.\nMe too. You were too young to know\nAbout it. You better wait outside;\nThere're some things you shouldn't\nHear.\n\nMICHAEL\nI can help you out...\n\nSONNY\nOh no you can't, the old man'd be\nSore as hell if I let you get mixed\nUp in this.\n\nMICHAEL\nJesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.\n\nSONNY\nTheresa.\n\nShe understands, and leaves them alone.\n\nSONNY\nAll right, Mikey...who do we have\nTo hit, Clemenza or Paulie?\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat?\n\nSONNY\nOne of them fingered the old man.\n\nMICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on\nTrial for their lives.\n\nMICHAEL\nClemenza? No, I don't believe it.\n\nSONNY\nYou're right, kid, Clemenza is okay.\nIt was Paulie.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow can you be sure?\n\nSONNY\nOn the three days Paulie was sick\nThis month, he got calls from a\nPayphone across from the old man's\nBuilding. We got people in the\nPhone company.\n(he shrugs)\nThank God it was Paulie...we'll\nNeed Clemenza bad.\n\nMICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the\nSituation.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs it going to be all-out war, like\nLast time?\n\nSONNY\nUntil the old man tells me different.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.\n\nSONNY\nSollozzo is a dead man, I don't\nCare what it costs. I don't care\nIf we have to fight all the five\nFamilies in New York. The Tattaglia\nFamily's going to eat dirt. I\nDon't care if we all go down\nTogether.\n\nMICHAEL\n(softly)\nThat's not how Pop would have\nPlayed it.\n\nSONNY\nI know I'm not the man he was. But\nI'll tell you this and he'll tell\nYou too. When it comes to real\nAction, I can operate as good as\nAnybody short range.\n\nMICHAEL\n(calmly)\nAll right, Sonny. All right.\n\nSONNY\nChrist, if I could only contact Luca.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs it like they say? Is he that\nGood?\n\nOutside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief.\nThen open the door and rush out.\n\nEveryone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped\nIn a tight embrace with his WIFE.\n\nHAGEN\nIf I plead before the Supreme\nCourt, I'll never do better than I\nDid tonight with that Turk.\n\nEXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's\nStudy. It stands out against the cold, dark night.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on\nThe edge of the sofa. The clock reads: 4:00 a.m.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nSONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted,\nIn shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep. It is four in the\nMorning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many\nSnacks. They can barely talk anymore.\n\nHAGEN\nIs the hospital covered?\n\nSONNY\nThe cops have it locked in and I\nGot my people there visiting Pop\nAll the time. What about the hit\nList.\n\nHAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.\n\nHAGEN\nToo much, too far, too personal.\nThe Don would consider this all\nPurely a business dispute: Get rid\nOf Sollozzo, and everything falls\nIn line. YOU don't have to go\nAfter the Tattaglias.\n\nCLEMENZA nods.\n\nHAGEN\nWhat about Luca? Sollozzo didn't\nSeem worried about Luca. That\nWorries me.\n\nSONNY\nIf Luca sold out we're in real\nTrouble.\n\nHAGEN\nHas anyone been able to get in\nTouch with him?\n\nSONNY\nNo, and I've been calling all night.\nMaybe he's shacked up.\n\nHAGEN\nLuca never sleeps over with a broad.\nHe always goes home when he's\nThrough. Mike, keep ringing Luca's\nNumber.\n\nMICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the\nNumber once again. He can hear the phone ringing on the\nOther end but no one answers. Then hangs up.\n\nHAGEN\nKeep trying every fifteen minutes.\n(exhausted)\n\nSONNY\nTom, you're the Consigliere, what\nDo we do if the old man dies?\n\nHAGEN\nWithout your father's political\nContacts and personal influence,\nThe Corleone family loses half its\nStrength. Without your father, the\nOther New York families might wind\nUp supporting Sollozzo, and the\nTattaglias just to make sure there\nIsn't a long destructive war. The\nOld days are over, this is 1946;\nNobody wants bloodshed anymore. If\nYour father dies...make the deal,\nSonny.\n\nSONNY\n(angry)\nThat's easy to say; it's not your\nFather.\n\nHAGEN\n(quietly)\nI was as good a son to him as you\nOr Mike.\n\nSONNY\nOh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it\nThat way.\n\nHAGEN\nWe're all tired...\n\nSONNY\nOK, we sit tight until the old man\nCan give us the lead. But Tom, I\nWant you to stay inside the Mall.\nYou too, Mike, no chances. Tessio,\nYou hold your people in reserve,\nBut have them nosing around the\nCity. The hospital is yours; I\nWant it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours\nA day.\n\nThere is a timid knock on the door.\n\nSONNY\nWhat is it?\n\nPAULIE GATTO looks in.\n\nCLEMENZA\nI tol' you to stay put, Paulie...\n\nPAULIE\nThe guy at the gate's outside...says\nThere's a package...\n\nSONNY\nTessio, see what it is.\n\nTESSIO gets up, leaves.\n\nPAULIE\nYou want me to hang around?\n\nSONNY\nYeah. Hang around.\n\nPAULIE\nOutside?\n\nCLEMENZA\nOutside.\n\nPAULIE\nSure.\n\nHe closes the door.\n\nSONNY\nClemenza. You take care of Paulie.\nI don't ever want to see him again.\nUnderstood?\n\nCLEMENZA\nUnderstood.\n\nSONNY\nOkay, now you can move your men\nInto the Mall, replace Tessio's\nPeople. Mike, tomorrow you take a\nCouple of Clemenza's people and go\nTo Luca's apartment and wait for\nHim to show. That crazy bastard\nMight be going after Sollozzo right\nNow if he's heard the news.\n\nHAGEN\nMaybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up\nIn this so directly. You know the\nOld man doesn't want that.\n\nSONNY\nOK forget it, just stay on the phone.\n\nMICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected. He dials Luca\nBrasi's number once again. The ring repeats, but no one\nAnswers.\n\nTESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest\nIn his hand. He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped\nInside.\n\nCLEMENZA\nA Sicilian message: Luca Brasi\nSleeps with the fishes.\n\nINT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we\nRemember him. BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.\nLUCA looks up at him.\n\nThen SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.\nLUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both\nClamp down as hard as they can. Suddenly, a garrote is\nThrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight. His\nFace begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally\nPurple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a\nFar more extreme way than a normal tongue could. His eyes\nBulge.\n\nONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's\nStrength leaves him.\n\nBRUNO\n(making an ugly face)\nOh Christ...all over the floor.\n\nSOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his\nFace.\n\nLUCA falls to the floor.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThe Godfather is next.\n\n----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)\n\nMorning in a simple Brooklyn suburb. There are rows of\nPleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block. A\nDark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a\nNoticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell. This\nIs ROCCO LAMPONE. The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,\nTalks to him through the screen door, and then points to the\nSide of the house. ROCCO moves to the garage, which is\nSpecially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work\nWashing a shiny brand new Lincoln. LAMPONE admires the car.\n\nLAMPONE\nNice.\n\nCLEMENZA\nCrazy Detroit delivered it with a\nWooden bumper. They're going to\nSend me the chrome bumpers in a\nCouple months. I waited two years\nFor this car to come with wooden\nBumpers!\n\nHe scrubs and polishes with great affection.\n\nCLEMENZA\nToday you make your bones on Paulie.\nYou understand everything?\n\nLAMPONE\nSure.\n\nAs he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it,\nUnwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.\n\nCLEMENZA\n.22 soft-nosed load. Accurate up\nTo five feet.\n\nLAMPONE expertly puts the gun away. GATTO's car pulls into\nThe driveway, and he sounds the horn.\n\nThe two men walk to the car. GATTO is driving, a bit\nNervous, like he doesn't know what is up. LAMPONE gets in\nThe rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of\nRecognition. He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting\nTo chide PAULIE for being late. PAULIE flinches a little\nWhen he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:\n\nPAULIE\nRocco, sit on the other side. A\nBig guy like you blocks my rearview\nMirror.\n\nCLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.\n\nCLEMENZA\nGoddamn Sonny. He's running scared.\nHe's already thinking of going to\nThe mattresses. We have to find a\nPlace on the West Side. Paulie,\nYou know a good location?\n\nPAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook\nHe was on. Also there's the money he can make by selling\nSollozzo any secret location.\n\nPAULIE\nI'll think about it.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(grunting)\nDrive while you thinking; I wanna\nGet to the City this month!\n\nThe car pulls out.\n\nEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)\n\nInside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump. OUR\nVIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.\n\nEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter\nLight.\n\nINT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)\n\nInside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.\nHe tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of\nHim.\n\nCLEMENZA\nPay attention!\n\nEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe car is parked in the City. PAULIE comes down from an\nAvailable apartment and gets back into the car.\n\nPAULIE\nGood for ten men...\n\nCLEMENZA\nOK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm\nSuppose to call when I found\nSomethin'.\n\nThe car pulls off.\n\nEXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\nNew part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.\nCLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.\n\nCLEMENZA\nYou wait; I'll call.\n\nHe walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the\nCorner and enters the Luna Restaurant.\n\nINT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.\nThe WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some\nBread--and then a plate of veal on his table. He eats.\n\nEXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants;\nHe is well fed.\n\nWe move with him around the corner, not knowing what to\nExpect has happened to Paulie.\n\nThere is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel,\nLAMPONE in the rear seat. CLEMENZA steps in.\n\nCLEMENZA\nHe talked my ear off. Want us to\nGo back to Long Beach; have another\nJob for us. Rocco, you live in the\nCity, can we drop you off?\n\nLAMPONE (O.S.)\nAh, I left my car at your place.\n\nCLEMENZA\nOK, then you gotta come back.\n\nThe car pulls out. By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and\nSecure.\n\nPAULIE\nYou think we'll go for that last\nPlace?\n\nCLEMENZA\nMaybe, or you gotta know now.\n\nPAULIE\nHoly cow, I don't gotta know nothing.\n\nEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.\nInside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.\n\nCLEMENZA\nPaulie, pull over. I gotta take a\nLeak.\n\nThe car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds. CLEMENZA\nSteps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.\n\nHe turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer\nSee the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting\nThe ground. We wait on this for a moment; and then there\nAre two GUNSHOTS. CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and\nTurns, moving back to the car.\n\nPAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind\nHim are shattered.\n\nCLEMENZA\nLeave the gun.\n\nLAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few\nFeet where there is another car. They get in, and drive off.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nHIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL. It is late afternoon. Many strange\nCars are parked on the nearby streets. We can see the group\nOf BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries\nWith concealed weapons.\n\nMICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.\n\nHe is bundled in a warm marine coat. He looks at the\nStrange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe. They\nLook back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the\nRespect of his position. He is like an exile Prince. He\nWanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.\n\nA rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground\nEquipment. The basketball ring now half coming off. This\nIs where he was a child. Then a shout.\n\nCLEMENZA (O.S.)\nMike. Hey Mikey; telephone.\n\nCLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window. MICHAEL\nHurries into the house.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.\nHe points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the\nHook.\n\nCLEMENZA\nSome dame.\n\nMICHAEL picks it up.\n\nMICHAEL\nHello. Kay?\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nHow is your father?\n\nMICHAEL\nHe'll be OK.\n\nKAY (O.S.)\n(pause)\nI love you.\n\nHe glances at the THUGS in the kitchen. Tries to shield the\nPhone.\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nI LOVE YOU.\n\nMICHAEL\nYeah Kay, I'm here.\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nCan you say it?\n\nMICHAEL\nHuh?\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nTell me you love me.\n\nMICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table. He curls\nUp in a corner, and in a quarter voice:\n\nMICHAEL\nI can't...\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nPlease say it.\n\nMICHAEL\nLook. I'll see you tonight, OK?\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nOK.\n(click)\n\nCLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all\nThe button men stationed around the house.\n\nCLEMENZA\nHow come you don't tell that nice\nGirl you love her...here, learn\nSomething... you may have to feed\nFifty guys some day. You start\nWith olive oil...fry some garlic,\nSee. And then fry some sausage...or meat\nBalls if you like...then you throw\nIn the tomatoes, the tomato\nPaste...some basil; and a little\nRed wine...that's my trick.\n\nSONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.\n\nSONNY\nYou take care of Paulie?\n\nCLEMENZA\nYou won't see Paulie anymore. He's\nSick for good this winter.\n\nMICHAEL starts to leave.\n\nSONNY\nWhere are you going?\n\nMICHAEL\nTo the city.\n\nSONNY\n(to Clemenza; dipping\nBread into the sauce)\nSend some bodyguards.\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't need them, Sonny. I'm just\nGoing to see Pop in the hospital.\nAlso, I got other things.\n\nCLEMENZA\nSollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.\n\nSONNY\nOK, but be careful.\n\nEXT NITE: CAR\n\nMICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven\nInto the city. THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front\nSeat.\n\nINT NITE: HOTEL LOBBY\n\nMICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying\nTo book rooms.\n\nINT NITE: HOTEL\n\nMICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel. He is\nPreoccupied, she's concerned.\n\nMICHAEL\nVisiting hour ends at eight thirty.\nI'll just sit with him; I want to\nShow respect.\n\nKAY\nCan I go to the hospital with you?\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't think so. You don't want\nTo end up on page 3 of the Daily\nNews.\n\nKAY\nMy parents don't read the Daily\nNews. All right, if you think I\nShouldn't. I can't believe the\nThings the papers are printing.\nI'm sure most of it's not true.\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't think so either.\n(silence)\nI better go.\n\nKAY\nWhen will I see you again?\n\nMICHAEL\nI want you to go back to New\nHampshire...think things over.\n\nHe leans over her; kisses her.\n\nKAY\nWhen will I see you again?\n\nMICHAEL\nGoodbye.\n\nQuietly, he moves out the door.\n\nKAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:\n\nKAY\nGoodbye.\n\nEXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)\n\nA taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with\nA neon sign \"HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY.\" MICHAEL steps out, pays\nThe fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.\n\nMICHAEL looks.\n\nHe sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted. He\nIs the only one on the street. There are gay, twinkling\nChristmas decorations all over the building. He walks,\nSlowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps. He\nHesitates, looks around. This area is empty. He checks the\nAddress on a scrap of paper. It is correct. He tries the\nDoor, it is empty.\n\nHe walks in.\n\nINT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital\nLobby. He looks to the right; there is a long, empty\nCorridor. To the left: the same.\n\nHIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated\nBuilding lit by eerie green neon lighting. All we hear are\nHis sole footsteps.\n\nHe walks up to a desk marked \"INFORMATION\". No one is there.\nHe moves quickly to a door marked \"OFFICE\"; swings into it;\nNo one is there. He looks onto the desk: There is half a\nSandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.\n\nMICHAEL\nHello? Hello?\n\nNow he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,\nAlertly. MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all\nAlone. The floors have just been mopped. They are still wet.\n\nINT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS\n\nNow he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several\nFlights.\n\nINT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR\n\nHe steps out onto the fourth floor. He looks. There are\nMerely empty corridors. He takes out his scrap of paper;\nChecks it. \"Room 4A.\" Now he hurries, trying to follow the\nCode of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker\nAnd quicker they flash by him. Now he stops, looks up \"4A--\nCorleone\".\n\nThere is a special card table set up there with some\nMagazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the\nAshtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A\n\nSlowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he\nWill find. He looks. Lit by the moonlight through the\nWindow, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the\nRoom, and under a transparent oxygen tent. All that can be\nHeard is the steady though strained breathing. Slowly\nMICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,\nSecurely asleep. Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the\nBed, and run to his nose and mouth.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nThis startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around. It is a\nNURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.\n\nNURSE\nYou're not supposed to be here now.\n\nMICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm Michael Corleone--this is my\nFather. What happened to the\nDetectives who were guarding him?\n\nNURSE\nOh your father just had too many\nVisitors. It interfered with the\nHospital service. The police came\nAnd made them all leave just ten\nMinutes ago.\n(comfortingly)\nBut don't worry. I look in on him.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou just stand here one minute...\n\nQuickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.\n\nMICHAEL\nSonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm\nDown at the hospital. I came down\nLate. There's no one here. None\nOf Tessio's people--no detectives,\nNo one. The old man is completely\nUnprotected.\n\nSONNY (O.S.)\nAll right, get him in a different\nRoom; lock the door from the inside.\nI'll have some men there inside of\nFifteen minutes. Sit tight, and\nDon't panic.\n\nMICHAEL\n(furiously, but kept inside)\nI won't panic.\n\nHe hangs up; returns to the NURSE...\n\nNURSE\nYou cannot stay here...I'm sorry.\n\nMICHAEL\n(coldly)\nYou and I are going to move my\nFather right now...to another room\nOn another floor...Can you\nDisconnect those tubes so we can\nWheel the bed out?\n\nNURSE\nAbsolutely not! We have to get\nPermission from the Doctor.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou've read about my father in the\nPapers. You've seen that no one's\nHere to guard him. Now I've just\nGotten word that men are coming to\nThis hospital to kill him. Believe\nMe and help me.\n\nNURSE\n(frightened)\nWe don't have to disconnect them,\nWe can wheel the stand with the bed.\n\nShe does so...and they perform the very difficult task of\nMoving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.\n\nINT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)\n\nThey roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently\nDown the corridor. We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.\nMICHAEL hears them, stops.\n\nMICHAEL\nHurry, into there.\n\nThey push it into the first available room. MICHAEL peeks\nOut from the door. The footsteps are louder; then they\nEmerge. It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet\nOf flowers.\n\nMICHAEL\n(stepping out)\nWho is it?\n\nENZO\nMichael...do you remember me, Enzo,\nThe baker's helper to Nazorine, now\nHis son-in-law.\n\nMICHAEL\nEnzo, get out of here. There's\nGoing to be trouble.\n\nA look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.\n\nENZO\nIf there...will be trouble...I stay\nWith you, to help. I owe it to the\nGodfather.\n\nMICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.\n\nMICHAEL\nGo outside; stand in front...I'll\nBe out in a minute.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nThey part. MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they\nPut his FATHER.\n\nNURSE\n(frightened)\nHe's awake.\n\nMICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he\nCannot speak. MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.\n\nMICHAEL\nPop...Pop, it's me Michael. Shhhh,\nDon't try to speak. There are men\nWho are coming to try to kill you.\nBut I'm with you...I'm with you\nNow...\n\nThe OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot. MICHAEL tenderly\nPuts his finger to his FATHER's lips.\n\nEXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)\n\nOutside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,\nPacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only\nWeapon. MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him. They\nBoth stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.\nThey are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,\nLights it. ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.\n\nMICHAEL\nGet rid of those and look like\nYou've got a gun in your pocket.\n\nThe windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas\nDecorations.\n\nMICHAEL\nListen...\n\nWe HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming. MICHAEL\nAnd ENZO look with fear in their eyes. Then MICHAEL takes\nThe bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.\nThey stand, hands in their pockets.\n\nA long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.\nMICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive. The car\nSeems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.\nMICHAEL and ENZO are relieved. MICHAEL looks down; the\nBAKER's hands are shaking. He looks at his own, and they\nAre not.\n\nAnother moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of\nPolice sirens. They are clearly coming toward the hospital,\nGetting louder and louder. MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.\n\nIn a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of\nThe hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed\nPOLICE and DETECTIVES. He smiles his relief and starts\nToward them. TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his\nArms while ANOTHER frisks him. A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,\nSpattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,\nWith beefy red face and white hair seems furious. This is\nMcCLUSKEY.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nI thought I got all you guinea\nHoods locked up. Who the hell are\nYou and what are you doing here?\n\nANOTHER COP standing nearby:\n\nCOP\nHe's clean, Captain.\n\nMICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.\n\nMICHAEL\n(quietly)\nWhat happened to the detectives who\nWere supposed to be guarding my\nFather?\n\nMCCLUSKEY\n(furious)\nYou punk-hood. Who the hell are\nYou to tell me my business. I\nPulled them off. I don't care how\nMany Dago gangsters kill each other.\nI wouldn't lift a finger to keep\nYour old man from getting knocked\nOff. Now get the hell out of here;\nGet off this street you punk, and\nStay away from this hospital.\n\nMICHAEL stands quiet.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll stay until you put guards\nAround my father's room.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nPhil, lock this punk up.\n\nA DETECTIVE\nThe Kid's clean, Captain...He's a\nWar hero, and he's never been mixed\nUp in the rackets...\n\nMCCLUSKEY\n(furious)\nGoddam it, I said lock him up. Put\nThe cuffs on him.\n\nMICHAEL\n(deliberately, right\nTo McCLUSKEY's face,\nAs he's being handcuffed)\nHow much is the Turk paying you to\nSet my father up, Captain?\n\nWithout any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL\nSquarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.\nMICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw. He looks at\nMcCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and\nHe falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S\nMEN arrive.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nHIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL. The gateway now has a\nLong black car blocking it. There are more BUTTON MEN\nStationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying\nRifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN\nStanding by open windows. It is clear that the war is\nEscalating. A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,\nMICHAEL and HAGEN. MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged. He\nStops and looks up at the open window. We can see MEN\nHolding rifles.\n\nMICHAEL\nChrist, Sonny really means business.\n\nThey continue walking. TESSIO joins them. The various\nBODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.\n\nCLEMENZA\nHow come all the new men?\n\nTESSIO\nWe'll need them now. After the\nHospital incident, Sonny got mad.\nWe hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock\nThis morning.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY\n\nThey enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nSONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.\n\nSONNY\nI've got a hundred button men on\nThe streets twenty-four hours a day.\nIf Sollozzo shows one hair on his\nAss he's dead.\n\nHe sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,\nKiddingly.\n\nSONNY\nMikey, you look beautiful!\n\nMICHAEL\nCut it out.\n\nSONNY\nThe Turk wants to talk! The nerve\nOf that son of a bitch! After he\nCraps out last night he wants a meet.\n\nHAGEN\nWas there a definite proposal?\n\nSONNY\nSure, he wants us to send Mike to\nMeet him to hear his proposition.\nThe promise is the deal will be so\nGood we can't refuse.\n\nHAGEN\nWhat about that Tattaglias? What\nWill they do about Bruno?\n\nSONNY\nPart of the deal: Bruno cancels out\nWhat they did to my father.\n\nHAGEN\nWe should hear what they have to say.\n\nSONNY\nNo, no Consiglere. Not this time.\nNo more meetings, no more\nDiscussions, no more Sollozzo\nTricks. Give them one message: I\nWANT SOLLOZZO. If not, it's all\nOut war. We go to the mattresses\nAnd we put all the button men out\nOn the street.\n\nHAGEN\nThe other families won't sit still\nFor all out war.\n\nSONNY\nThen THEY hand me Sollozzo.\n\nHAGEN\nCome ON Sonny, your father wouldn't\nWant to hear this. This is not a\nPersonal thing, this is Business.\n\nSONNY\nAnd when they shot me father...\n\nHAGEN\nYes, even the shooting of your\nFather was business, not personal...\n\nSONNY\nNo no, no more advice on how to\nPatch it up Tom. You just help me\nWin. Understood?\n\nHAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.\n\nHAGEN\nI found out about this Captain\nMcCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.\nHe's definitely on Sollozzo's\nPayroll, and for big money.\nMcCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's\nBodyguard. What you have to\nUnderstand is that while Sollozzo\nIs guarded like this, he's\nInvulnerable. Nobody has ever\nGunned down a New York Police\nCaptain. Never. It would be\nDisastrous. All the five families\nWould come after you Sonny; the\nCorleone family would be outcasts;\nEven the old man's political\nProtection would run for cover. So\nJust...take that into consideration.\n\nSONNY\n(still fuming)\nMcCluskey can't stay with the Turk\nForever. We'll wait.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe can't wait. No matter what\nSollozzo say about a deal, he's\nFiguring out how to kill Pop. You\nHave to get Sollozzo now.\n\nSONNY\nThe kid's right.\n\nHAGEN\nWhat about McCluskey?\n\nMICHAEL\nLet's say now that we have to kill\nMcCluskey. We'll clear that up\nThrough our Newspaper contacts later.\n\nSONNY\nGo on Mike.\n\nMICHAEL\nThey want me to go to the conference\nWith Sollozzo. Set up the meeting\nFor two days from now. Sonny, get\nOur informers to find out where the\nMeeting will be held.\nInsist it has to be a public place:\nA bar or restaurant at the height\nOf the dinner hour. So I'll feel\nSafe. They'll check me when I meet\nThem so I won't be able to carry a\nWeapon; but Clemenza, figure out a\nWay to have one planted there for\nMe.\n(pause)\nThen I'll kill them both.\n\nEveryone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.\nSilence. SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter. He points\nA finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.\n\nSONNY\nYou? You, the high-class college\nKid. You never wanted to get mixed\nUp in the family business. Now you\nWanta gun down a police Captain and\nThe Turk just because you got\nSlapped in the face. You're taking\nIt personal, it's just business and\nHe's taking it personal.\n\nNow CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps\nHis face serious.\n\nMICHAEL\n(angrily, but cold)\nSonny, it's all personal, and I\nLearned it from him, the old man,\nThe Godfather. He took my joining\nThe Marines personal. I take\nSollozzo trying to kill my father\nPersonal, and you know I'll kill\nThem Sonny.\n\nMICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.\n\nINT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLOSE on a revolver.\n\nCLEMENZA (O.S.)\nIt's as cold as they come,\nImpossible to trace.\n(he turns it upside down)\nDon't worry about prints Mike, I\nPut a special tape on the trigger\nAnd butt. Here.\n(he hands the gun to\nAnother pair of hands)\nWhatsamatter? Trigger too tight.\n(it fires: very LOUD)\nI left it noisy, so it'll scare any\nPain-in-the-neck innocent bystander\nAway.\n\nMICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.\n\nCLEMENZA\nJust let your hand drop to your\nSide, and let the gun slip out.\nEverybody will still think you got\nIt. They'll be starin' at your\nFace, see? Then walk out of the\nPlace real fast, but don't run.\nDon't look anybody directly in the\nEye, but don't look away from them\nNeither. Hey, they'll be scared\nStiff o you, believe me. Nobody's\nGonna bother with you. Don't worry\nAbout nothing; you'd be surprised\nHow good these things go. O.K.,\nPut your hat on, let's see how you\nLook. Helps with identification.\n\nThey put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.\n\nCLEMENZA\nMostly it gives witnesses an excuse\nTo change their identification when\nWe make them see the light. Then\nYou take a long vacation and we\nCatch the hell.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow bad will it be?\n\nCLEMENZA\nProbably all the other families\nWill line up against us. But, it's\nAlright. These things have to\nHappen once every ten years or\nSo...gets rid of the bad blood.\nYou gotta stop 'em at the beginning.\nLike they shoulda stopped Hitler at\nMunich, they shoulda never let him\nGet away with that, they were just\nAsking for big trouble...\n\nINT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house. A card\nTable is set up with a man playing cards with three of the\nCorleone buttonmen.\n\nHe continues into the living room. It's a mess. SONNY\nAsleep on the sofa. On the coffee table are the remains of\nA take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of\nWhisky. The radio is playing.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy don't you stop living like a\nBum and get this place cleaned up.\n\nSONNY\nWhat are you, inspecting the\nBarracks?\n(SONNY sits up with\nHis head in his hands)\nYou ready? Did Clemenza tell you\nBe sure to drop the gun right away?\n\nMICHAEL\nA million times.\n\nSONNY\nSollozzo and McCluskey are going to\nPick you up in an hour and a half\nOn Times Square, under the big\nCamels sign.\n\nHAGEN\nWe don't let Mike go until we have\nThe hostage, Sonny.\n\nCLEMENZA\nIt's okay...the hostage is outside\nPlaying pinochle with three of my\nMen.\n\nThe phone rings in the DON's office.\n\nSONNY\nThat could be a Tattaglia informer\nWith the meeting place.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nHAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS\nMove in.\n\nHAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.\n\nSONNY\nOne of Tattaglia's people?\n\nHAGEN\nNo. Our informer in McCluskey's\nPrecinct. Tonight at 8:00 he\nSigned out for Louis' Restaurant in\nThe Bronx. Anyone know it.\n\nTESSIO\nSure, I do. It's perfect for us.\nA small family place with big\nBooths where people can talk in\nPrivate. Good food. Everybody\nMinds their business. Perfect.\n(he moves to the desk\nAnd makes a crude drawing)\nThis is the entrance, Mike. When\nYou finish just walk out and turn\nLeft, then turn the corner.\nClemenza, you gotta work fast to\nPlant the gun. They got an old-\nFashioned toilet with a space\nBetween the water container and the\nWall. We can tape the gun behind\nThere.\n\nCLEMENZA\nMike, they're gonna frisk you in\nThe car. You'll be clean so they\nWon't worry 'bout nothing. In the\nRestaurant, wait and talk a while,\nAnd then ask permission to go. See?\nThen when you come out, don't waste\nTime; don't sit down...you come out\nBlasting. And don't take chances.\nIn the head, two shots apiece. And\nOut as fast as your legs can move.\n\nSONNY\nI want somebody very good, very\nSafe to plant that gun. I don't\nWant my brother coming out of that\nToilet with just his dick in his\nHand.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThe gun will be there.\n\nSONNY\n(to MICHAEL, warmly)\nYou're on, kid...I'll square it\nWith Mom your not seeing her before\nYou left. And I'll get a message\nTo your girl friend when I think\nThe time is right.\n\nCLEMENZA\nWe gotta move...\n\nMICHAEL\nO.K. How long do you think before\nI can come back?\n\nSONNY\nProbably a year...\n\nHAGEN\n(starting to crack)\nJesus, I don't know...\n\nSONNY\nCan you do it Mike?\n\nMICHAEL moves out.\n\nEXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe enormous \"CAMELS\" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands\nMICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat\nCLEMENZA had given him. A long black car pulls around the\nCorner and slows before him. The DRIVER, leaning over, open\nThe front door.\n\nDRIVER\nGet in, Mike.\n\nHe does, the car drives off.\n\nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)\n\nInside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat\nAnd shakes MIKE's hand.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI'm glad you came, Mike. I hope we\nCan straighten everything out. All\nThis is terrible, it's not the way\nI wanted things to happen at all.\nIt should never have happened.\n\nMICHAEL\nI want to settle things tonight. I\nWant my father left alone.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nHe won't be; I swear to you be my\nChildren he won't be. Just keep an\nOpen mind when we talk. I hope\nYou're not a hothead like your\nBrother, Sonny. It's impossible to\nTalk business with him.\n\nMcCLUSKEY grunts.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nHe's a good kid. He's all right.\nTurn around, up on your knees,\nFacing me.\n\nHe gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nI'm sorry about the other night\nMike. I'm getting too old for my\nJob, too grouchy. Can't stand the\nAggravation. You know how it is.\nHe's clean.\n\nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where\nThey're heading.\n\nThe car takes the George Washington Bridge. MICHAEL is\nConcerned.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe're going to New Jersey?\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(sly)\nMaybe.\n\nMICHAEL closes his eyes.\n\nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way\nTo New Jersey. Then suddenly it hits the divider,\nTemporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the\nLanes going back to New York. It then hits it very fast, on\nThe way back to the city.\n\nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)\n\nSOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and\nThen leans to the DRIVER.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nNice work; I'll remember it.\n\nMICHAEL is relieved.\n\nEXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in\nThe Bronx: The \"LUNA AZURA\". There is no one on the street.\nMICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with\nThem. He gets out, and opens the door. SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY\nAnd MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the\nCar. They enter the restaurant.\n\nINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)\n\nA very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.\nSOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small\nRound table near the center of the room. There are empty\nBooths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,\nAnd ONE or TWO WAITERS. It is very quiet.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nIs the Italian food good here?\n\nSOLLOZZO\nTry the veal; it's the finest in\nNew York.\n\nThe solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.\nThey watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three\nGlasses. Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI am going to talk Italian to Mike.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nSure, you two go right ahead; I'll\nConcentrate on my veal and my\nSpaghetti.\n\nSOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian. MICHAEL listening\nCarefully and nodding every so often. Then MICHAEL answers\nIn Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on. The WAITER occasionally\nBrings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.\nThen MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in\nItalian, accidentally lapses into English.\n\nMICHAEL\n(using English for emphasis)\nMost important...I want a sure\nGuarantee that no more attempts\nWill be made on my father's life.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nWhat guarantees can I give you? I\nAm the hunted one. I've missed my\nChance. You think too highly of\nMe, my friend...I am not so\nClever...all I want if a truce...\n\nMICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling\nHolding his open hands up as if to say: \"I have no tricks up\nMy sleeve\". Then he looks away and makes a distressed look\nOn his face.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nWhat is it?\n\nMICHAEL\nIs it all right if I go to the\nBathroom?\n\nSOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious. He studies MICHAEL with\nHis dark eyes. Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's\nThigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nI frisked him; I've frisked\nThousands of young punks; he's clean.\n\nHe looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;\nIndicating the bathroom with his eyes. The MAN nods,\nIndicating no one is there.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nDon't take too long.\n\nMICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and\nDisappears inside.\n\nINT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very\nHard. He actually uses the urinal. Then he washes his\nHands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.\nThen he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.\nSlowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he\nCannot feel the gun. We see behind the tank his hand is\nJust a few inches from the gun...he gropes\nSearchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.\n\nCLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him. Then he\nBreaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep\nBreath and shoves it under his waistband. For some\nUnexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately\nWashes his hands and dries them. Then he goes out.\n\nINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)\n\nHe hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.\nMcCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal. SOLLOZZO\nTurns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at\nMICHAEL. MICHAEL looks back. Then he smiles and continues\nBack to the table. He sits down.\n\nMICHAEL\nNow I can talk. I feel much better.\n\nThe MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now\nHe too relaxes. SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down\nComfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton\nHis jacket. SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again\nBut MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear\nHim.\n\nThe WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to\nSpeak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away\nFrom him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts\nThe gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his\nTemple. He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's\nHead blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the\nEntire area.\n\nThe WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is\nSprayed and stained with blood.\n\nSOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he\nSeems to hang in space suspended.\n\nMICHAEL pivots, and looks:\n\nThere is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal\nSuspended in air before his gaping mouth.\n\nMICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging\nThroat. He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound. Then\nCoolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right\nThrough McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.\n\nThe air is filled with pink mist.\nMICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.\nHe does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.\nNow he carefully shows his hands to be empty.\nThe WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an\nExpression of horror on his face.\nMICHAEL looks at his two victims:\nSOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by\nThe table.\nMcCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.\nMICHAEL is wildly at a peak. He starts to move out. His\nHand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.\nHe moves, not letting the gun go.\n\nMICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.\n\nHis hand: still holding the gun.\n\nHis face: finally he closes his eyes.\n\nHis hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.\n\nHe walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.\n\nHe sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had\nBeen recreated in wax.\n\nThen he leaves.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old\nUpright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.\nANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.\n\nA little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,\nQuietly eating. They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there\nIs an occasional laugh.\n\nROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered\nWith a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.\n\nA large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.\n\nThe sentimental tune is continued over the following:\n\nINT DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie\nStill together in a bullet-riddled automobile.\n\nINT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.\n\nINT DAY: MATTRESS\n\nTen mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty\nLiving room of an apartment. THREE or FOUR MEN including\nCLEMENZA, are taking naps.\n\nAn arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.\n\nThe MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and\nPouring the wine.\n\nTrash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.\n\nINT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an\nOffice building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S.\nTruman.\n\nEXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945)\n\nANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning\nThree steps of a front stoop.\n\nINT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\nTESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a\nCrossword puzzle.\n\nA thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.\n\nSix or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.\nCoffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.\n\nA MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of\nRuffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.\n\nEXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945)\n\nA CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet\nAlley.\n\nINT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in\nA pool of blood on the tablecloth.\n\nINT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\nA neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an\nApartment. We catch a glimpse of one headline: \"Five Family\nWar...\"\n\nThe table. The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts. ONE\nHas fallen asleep on his arms at the table.\n\nSEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.\n\nThe PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse. Picks up\nAnd takes a drag from his cigarette. The OTHER MAN nods\nAppreciatively.\n\nMAN\nNice Augie...nice.\n\nEXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46)\n\nSeveral cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York\nApartment building. We recognize a couple of SONNY's\nBodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards\nAgainst the curb.\n\nInside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of\nBrass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.\n\nUp one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step,\nSmoking a cigarette.\n\nOne of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch,\nWhich is attached to a key chain. We HEAR the sound of a\nDoor opening; they look up.\n\nThe man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.\n\nSONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI\nWrapped around him. She doesn't want to let go of him; she\nDraws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he\nComes out alone, adjusting his clothes.\n\nHe jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard\nOn the first floor, and moves outside toward his car. The\nMen quickly take up their positions. As he gets in his car:\n\nDRIVER\nPick up your sister?\n\nSONNY\nYeah.\n\nThe car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the\nBodyguards in their cars.\n\nINT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)\n\nHe knocks on the door. No answer. Then again.\n\nCONNIE'S VOICE\nWho is it?\n\nSONNY\nIt's me, Sonny.\n\nWe hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open. SONNY\nEnters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her\nBack to him.\n\nSONNY\n(tenderly)\nConnie, what is it?\n\nHe turns her around in his arms.\n\nHer face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her\nRough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.\nAs soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red\nWith rage. She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing\nHim from running out of the apartment.\n\nCONNIE\n(desperately)\nIt was my fault! I started a fight\nWith him and I tried to hit him so\nHe hit me. He didn't even try to\nHit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.\n\nSonny listens, and calms himself. He touches her shoulder,\nThe thin silk robe.\n\nSONNY\nI'm goin' to have the doctor come\nOver and take a look at you.\n\nHe starts to leave.\n\nCONNIE\nOh Sonny, please don't do anything.\nPlease don't.\n\nHe stops, and then laughs good naturedly.\n\nSONNY\nHey. Con. What'm I goin' to do?\nMake your kid a orphan before he's\nBorn.\n\nShe laughs with him. He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.\n\nEXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET\n\nCARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.\n\"Book\" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking\nBeer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the\nCorner. The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the\nKids on the street are still playing stickball.\n\nCARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street\nSuddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block\nAnd to a halt in front of the candy store. The tires\nScream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a\nMAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast\nThe everyone is paralyzed. It is a moment before we\nRecognize that it is SONNY.\n\nHis face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on\nThe stoop and has CARLO by the throat.\n\nHe pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down\nInto the street. But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,\nAnd hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to\nHide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.\nHis shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.\n\nSALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.\n\nSONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,\nIn a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing. His\nBlows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.\n\nThe kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching\nIn fascination.\n\nCARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.\n\nSONNY beats him mercilessly.\n\nNow SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become\nSpectators.\n\nSONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into\nCARLO's face and body.\n\nCARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does\nNothing, other than hang onto the railing.\n\nSONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag\nHim off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in\nThe effort. Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;\nEven biting them. CARLO screams but he does not let go.\n\nIt's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will\nNot be moved. SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him\nMore; but he is exhausted. Totally out of breath, he\nStammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.\n\nSONNY\nYou...bastard...You...hurt my\nSister... again...and I'll\nKill...you.\n\nHe wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.\nAnd hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,\nLeaving even his bodyguards in confusion. We notice ONE MAN\nWith a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially\nInterested.\n\nCARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands. He slumps\nOnto the stoop.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nHIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall. It is a gray, rainy day.\nYoung BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of\nVarious points around the main house and compound. Things\nHave changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new\nAnd secure gate house has been built. Security measures\nThat had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made\nA permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval\nFortress. We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the\nResult of a recent bomb attempt. The house nearest the\nCrater is damaged by fire.\n\nA taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright\nYellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the\nShelter of the gate house.\n\nThey are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they\nCall the main house.\n\nKAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still\nRuns down onto her face.\n\nShe notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the\nSullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.\n\nTOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.\n\nHAGEN\nKay, we weren't expecting you. You\nShould call...\n\nKAY\nI've tried calling and writing. I\nWant to reach Michael.\n\nHAGEN\nNobody knows where he is. We know\nHe's all right, but that's all.\n\nKAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with\nRainwater.\n\nKAY\nWhat was that?\n\nHAGEN\nAn accident. No one was hurt.\n\nKAY\nListen Tom, I let my cab go; can I\nCome in to call another one?\n\nTOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has\nTo.\n\nHAGEN\nSure...I'm sorry.\n\nThey hurry through the rain and into the Main House.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nIn the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and\nTakes her rainhat off.\n\nKAY\nWill you give this to him.\n\nHAGEN\nIf I accept that letter and you\nTold a Court of Law I accepted it,\nThey would interpret it as my\nHaving knowledge of his whereabouts.\nJust wait Kay, he'll contact you.\n\nWe hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE\nEnters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.\n\nMAMA\nYou're Mikey's little girl.\n\nKAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.\n\nMAMA\nYou eat anything?\n\nKAY shakes her head.\n\nMAMA\n(to HAGEN)\nDisgrazia, you don't even give the\nPoor girl a cup of coffee?\n\nHAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves\nToward MAMA, the letter extended.\n\nKAY\nWill you give this letter to Michael.\n\nHAGEN\nMama, no.\n\nMAMA\nYou tell me what to do? Even he\nDon't tell me what to do.\n\nShe takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.\n\nKAY\nWhy did they blame Michael?\n\nMAMA\nYou listen to me, you go home to\nYour family, and you find a good\nYoung man and get married. Forget\nAbout Mikey; he's no good for you,\nAnymore.\n\nShe looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what\nThat means.\n\nEXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)\n\nA hospital in New York City. POLICE and teams of PRIVATE\nDETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area. An ambulance\nWith a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the\nHospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL\nASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying\nThe DON.\n\nTESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing\nUp the rear. HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a\nMoment they disappear behind the ambulance. Then suddenly,\nSiren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung\nCars.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe Corleone Mall.\n\nEqually impressive security stands ready at the Corleone\nMall. EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE\nDETECTIVES.\n\nIt all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.\nAll is silent. The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday\nClothes, wait.\n\nEXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)\n\nOne ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway,\nPreceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a\nTeam of BUTTON MEN.\n\nSitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with\nA rifle on his lap.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nInside the Main CORLEONE House:\n\nHospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully\nUnder the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and\nVarious GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.\n\nAll the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA,\nTHERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but\nBeen converted into a hospital room, with complete and\nExtensive equipment. The various CHILDREN get a turn to\nKiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then\nSONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO\nShould leave.\n\nThey do, the door is closed.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the\nSunday dinner, and set the table.\n\nCARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.\n\nCONNIE\nWhat's the matter, Carlo?\n\nCARLO\nShut up.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nAll the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with\nGrim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN. The DON\nDoes not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and\nGlances, as clearly as if they were verbalized. HAGEN is\nThe spokesman for the family.\n\nHAGEN\n...since McCluskey's killing, the\nPolice have cracked down on most of\nOur operations...on the other\nFamilies too. There's been a lot\nOf bad blood.\n\nThe OLD MAN glances at SONNY.\n\nSONNY\nPop, they hit us and we hit them\nBack.\n\nHAGEN\nWe put out a lot of material\nThrough our contacts in the\nNewspapers...about McCluskey's\nBeing tied up with Sollozzo in the\nDrug Rackets...things are starting\nTo loosen up.\n\nThe OLD MAN nods.\n\nSONNY\nFreddie's gonna go to Las\nVegas...under the protection of Don\nFrancesco of L.A. I want him to\nRest...\n\nFREDO\nI'm goin' to learn the casino\nBusiness.\n\nThe DON nods approvingly. Then he searches around the room\nFor a face he does not see. HAGEN knows who he's looking for.\n\nHAGEN\nMichael...\n(he takes a breath)\nIt was Michael who killed Sollozzo.\n\nThe DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and\nRage.\n\nHAGEN\nHe's safe now...we're already\nWorking on ways to bring him back.\n\nThe DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they\nLeave him alone.\n\nINT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nHAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is\nExpansive and optimistic.\n\nSONNY\nWe'll let the old man take it easy\nFor a couple of weeks. I want to\nGet things going good before he\nGets better. What's the matter\nWith you?\n\nHAGEN\nYou start operating, the five\nFamilies will start their raids\nAgain. We're at a stalemate Sonny,\nYour war is costing us a lot of\nMoney.\n\nSONNY\nNo more stalemate Tom, we got the\nSoldiers, we'll match them gun for\nGun if that's how they want it.\nThey know me for what I am, Tom--\nAnd they're scared of me.\n\nHAGEN\nYes. That's true, you're getting a\nHell of a reputation.\n\nSONNY\nWell it's war! We might not be in\nThis shape if we had a real war-\nTime Consiglere, a Sicilian. Pop\nHad Genco, who do I have?\n(TOM starts to leave)\nHey Tom, hey...hey. It's Sunday,\nWe're gonna have dinner. Don't be\nSore.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table\nOver Sunday dinner. SONNY is at the head of the table.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nSOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed\nMall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally\nBy the gate.\n\nONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house. A\nYoung BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.\n\n-----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------\n\nINT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)\n\nCONNIE and CARLO's apartment. She's in a slip, on the phone.\nWe HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.\n\nCONNIE\nWho is this?\n\nGIRL (O.S.)\n(giggle)\nI'm a friend of Carlo's. I just\nWanted to tell him I can't see him\nTonight; I have to go out of town.\n\nCONNIE's face turns red.\n\nCONNIE\nYou lousy tramp bitch.\n(click)\n\nShe slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the\nBathroom drying his golden body.\n\nCARLO\nWhat was that?\n\nCONNIE\nYour girl friend. She says she\nCan't make it tonight. You lousy\nBastard you have the nerve to give\nYour whores my telephone number.\nI'll kill you, you bastard!\n\nShe hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then\nShe flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy\nBelly heaving under the thin slip.\n\nCARLO\n(defending himself)\nYou're crazy. She was kidding\nAround; I don't know, some nut.\n\nHe pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue\nDressing.\n\nCONNIE\nYou're staying home. You're not\nGoing out.\n\nCARLO\nOK, OK. You gonna make me something\nTo eat at least?\n\nThat calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing\nHeavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and\nStarts her wifely duties.\n\nCARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in\nThe doorway.\n\nCONNIE\nThe food is on the table.\n\nCARLO\nI'm not hungry yet.\n\nCONNIE\nEat it, it's on the table.\n\nCARLO\nBa Fa Goulle.\n\nCONNIE\nBA FA GOULE YOU!\n\nShe turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen. A moment\nLater we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking. CARLO\nSlowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically\nSmashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy\nVeal and peppers all over the apartment floor.\n\nCARLO\nYou filthy guinea spoiled brat.\nClean it up or I'll kick your head\nIn.\n\nCONNIE\nLike hell I will.\n\nShe stands there, solid, ready to punch him again. Slowly,\nHe slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in\nHis hand.\n\nCARLO\nClean it up!\n\nHe swings the belt against her heavy hips. She moves back\nInto the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it\nReady.\n\nCARLO\nEven the female Corleones are\nMurderers.\n\nHe puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her. She\nMakes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids. He\nPulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process. She\nGets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table,\nGets her; and starts to slap her in the face.\n\nShe breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.\n\nCONNIE\nThe baby! The baby!\n\nINT DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nShe runs into the bedroom; he follows. She moves into a\nCorner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide\nUnder the bed.\n\nHe reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.\n\nHe slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he\nThrows her on the bed, contemptuously. He grabs part of her\nThigh, pinching it very hard.\n\nCARLO\nYou're fat as a pig.\n\nThen he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving\nHer in tears. She is crying; she pulls herself to the\nBedroom phone, and in a whisper:\n\nCONNIE\nMama...mama, it's Connie. Mama, I\nCan't talk any louder. No, I don't\nWant to talk to Sonny.\n\nWe can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)\n\nIn the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the\nWhispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.\n\nSONNY\nYeah Connie.\n\nCONNIE (O.S.)\nSonny, just send a car to bring me\nHome. I'll tell you then, it's\nNothing Sonny, don't you come.\nSend TOM, please Sonny, it's\nNothing; I just want to come home.\n\nSONNY's face is turning red.\n\nSONNY\n(in a controlled voice)\nYou wait there. You just wait there.\n\nHe hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.\n\nSONNY\n(quietly)\nThat sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...\n\nHAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he\nCannot interfere.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL\n\nSONNY leaves the house. HAGEN moves to the outside mall\nJust as SONNY's car is driving off. He moves to a group of\nBUTTON MEN.\n\nHAGEN\nGo after him.\n\nEXT DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)\n\nSONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.\nAfter a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is\nTrailing.\n\nSONNY is driving; he is very angry.\n\nEXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)\n\nSONNY in his car; driving back. Still breathing hard and\nStill furious. Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.\nHe starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a\nToll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the\nCOLLECTOR.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT\n\nThe serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nThis is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for\nDon Corleone, at his request.\n\nBONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.\nBONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.\n\nBONASERA\nYes, I understand. I'm listening.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nYou owe the Don a service. In one\nHour, not before, perhaps later, he\nWill be at your funeral parlor to\nAsk for your help. Be there to\nGreet him. If you have any\nObjections speak now, and I'll\nInform him.\n\nSilence. BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.\n\nBONASERA\nAnything...Anything the Godfather\nWishes.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nGood. He never doubted you.\n\nBONASERA\nThe Don himself is coming to me\nTonight?\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nYes.\n(click)\n\nBONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE\nSees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.\n\nSilently, he begins the ritual of dressing. His WIFE knows\nSomething serious is happening, and never takes her eyes\nFrom him. He lights a cigarette.\n\nBONASERA\nFor the last year, they have been\nKilling one another. So now, what?\nYour Godfather comes to me...Why?\n(whispering, slyly)\nThey've killed someone so important\nThat they wish to make his body\nDisappear.\n\nMRS. BONASERA\n(frightened)\nAmerigo!\n\nBONASERA\nThey could make me an accomplice to\nTheir murder. They could send me\nTo jail!\n\nHe slips into his trousers. Then he moves to his WIFE to\nTie his tie, as she has done for years.\n\nBONASERA\nAnd if the other families find\nOut...they will make me their enemy.\nThey could come here to our house.\nI curse the day I ever went to the\nGodfather.\n\nEXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)\n\nWith his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.\n\nINT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)\n\nBONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without\nTurning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room,\nPast the tables, and equipment. He operates the chain that\nLifts a large overhead garage type door. And looks out into\nThe alley.\n\nHe sits on a bench, and waits.\n\nEXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley;\nWe notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral\nParlor.\n\nCLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.\nBONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak. He notices TWO\nOTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a\nCORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet\nProtruding.\n\nBONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way\nThe MEN should carry their sinister burden.\n\nINT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThey carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming\nRoom.\n\nThen BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the\nDarkness somewhat uncertainly. It is DON CORLEONE.\n\nHe walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking. His\nCold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.\nThen, after a long gaze:\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWell my friend, are you ready to do\nMe this service?\n\nBONASERA nods. The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming\nTable; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.\n\nBONASERA\nWhat do you wish me to do?\n\nDON CORLEONE\n(staring at the table)\nI want you to use all your powers,\nAll your skill, as you love me. I\nDo not want his mother to see him\nAs he is.\n\nHe draws down the gray blanket.\n\nBONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:\n\nThe bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.\n\nEXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)\n\nSONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.\n\nA car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the\nBooth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets\nHim, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll\nBooths on both side of him, and from the front window of the\nCar blocking him.\n\nThe windows of his car are shot out.\n\nBullet holes puncture the doors of his car.\n\nHis hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.\n\nHis arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it\nContinues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that\nHe will survive it.\n\nSuddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and\nActually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER\nFire.\n\nHis face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.\n\nA FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and\nMake off in the distance.\n\nSONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they\nAre too late.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nView on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room. He is silent\nA moment, and then:\n\nHAGEN\n(quietly)\nOK. Go to Clemenza's house and\nTell him to come here right away.\nHe'll tell you what to do.\n\nThe MEN leave him alone. He is quiet, standing in the\nMiddle of the living room a moment. He looks in the\nDirection of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA\nMoving around.\n\nINT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)\n\nTOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the\nDON's room. He opens the DON's door. Looks in.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe DON in his hospital bed. Asleep under sedation. HAGEN\nHesitates. He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN. He\nCloses the door.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)\n\nHAGEN alone in the office. He is drinking. He looks up at\nThe sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving. Then he\nHears footsteps.\n\nThe door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE\nSlowly enters the room. He walks directly to his stuffed\nArmchair, sits down. His face is stern, as he looks into\nHAGEN's eyes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGive me a drop of anisette.\n\nHAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMy wife was weeping before she fell\nAsleep, outside my window I saw my\nCaporegimes to the house, and it is\nMidnight. So, Consigliere of mine,\nI think you should tell your Don\nWhat everyone knows.\n\nHAGEN\n(quietly)\nI didn't tell Mama anything. I was\nAbout to come up and wake you and\nTell you. Just now.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBut you needed a drink first.\n\nHAGEN\nYes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNow you've had your drink.\n\nPause.\n\nHAGEN\nThey shot Sonny on the Causeway.\n(pause)\nHe's dead.\n\nDON CORLEONE blinks. One feels that just for a second he\nLoses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of\nHim on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI want no inquiries made. No acts\nOf vengeance.\n(pause)\nConsigliere, arrange a meeting with\nThe heads of the five\nFamilies...this war stops now.\n\nHe rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nCall Bonasera...he will do me a\nService.\n\nAnd leaves. HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...\n\nHAGEN\nThis is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for\nDon Corleone, at his request.\n\nBONASERA (O.S.)\nYes, I understand I'm listening.\n\nHAGEN\nYou owe the Don a service. He has\nNo doubt that you will repay it.\n\nEXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)\n\nDay in Manhattan. An impressive Bank Building in the\nFinancial center of New York. Many limousines are parked,\nUniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.\n\nINT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.\n\nCARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man,\nSits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a\nMAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and\nSettles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man;\nAs the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:\n\nDON CORLEONE (O.S.)\nI want to thank you all for coming.\nI consider it a service done to me\nPersonally and I am in the debt of\nEach and every one of you.\nEspecially those of you who have\nTraveled from such distances as\nCalifornia, St. Louis, Kansas City;\nAnd New Orleans...\n\nThe VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both\nYounger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA,\nShort and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the\nTable to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his\nJEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an\nOlder man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO\nCUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then\nDON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair\nAnd a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his\nEarly sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at\nCONNIE's Wedding.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAh well, let's get down to business.\nWe are all honorable men here, we\nDon't have to give assurances as if\nWe were lawyers.\n(he sits, gazes out\nAt them, and sighs)\nHow did things ever go so far?\nWell, no matter. A lot of\nFoolishness has come to pass. It\nWas so unfortunate, so unnecessary.\n\nThe VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks. A\nLarge, clicking board is changing numbers at various times,\nAnd two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during\nThe day's trading, and projected above.\n\nDON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTattaglia has lost a son; I have\nLost a son. We are quits. Let\nThere be a peace...\n(he gestures\nExpressively,\nSubmissively, with\nHis hands)\nThat is all I want...\n\nBARZINI\nDon Corleone is too modest. He had\nThe judges and politicians in his\nPocket and he refused to share them.\nHis refusal is not the act of a\nFriend. He takes the bread out of\nThe mouths of our families. Times\nHave changed, it's not like the old\nDays where everyone can go his own\nWay. If Don Corleone had all the\nJudges and politicians in New York,\nThen he must share them or let\nOthers use them. Certainly he can\nPresent a bill for such services,\nWe're not Communists, after all.\nBut he has to let us draw water\nFrom the well. It's that simple.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMy friends, I didn't refuse out of\nMalice. You all know me. When\nHave I ever refused an accommodation?\nBut why, this time? Because I\nThink this drug business will\nDestroy us in the years to come.\nIt's not like whiskey or gambling\nOr even women which most people\nWant and is forbidden them by the\nPezzonovante of the Church and the\nGovernment. But drugs? No. Even\nPolicemen, who help us in gambling\nAnd other things would refuse to\nHelp us in drugs. But...I am\nWilling to do whatever all of you\nThink is necessary.\n\nDON ZALUCHI\nI don't believe in drugs. For\nYears I paid my people extra so\nThey wouldn't do that kind of\nBusiness...$200 a week. But it\nDidn't matter. Somebody comes to\nThem and says, \"I have powders, if\nYou put up three, four thousand\nDollar investment, we can make\nFifty thousand distributing.\" Who\nCan resist such a profit?\nThere's no way to control it, as a\nBusiness...to keep it respectable.\n(rapping the table)\nI don't want it near schools! I\nDon't want it sold to children.\nThat is an infamita.\n(thinking)\nIn my city I would try to keep the\nTraffic in the dark people, the\nColored. They are the best\nCustomers, the least troublesome,\nAnd they are animals anyway. They\nHave no respect for their wives or\nTheir families or themselves. Let\nThem lose their souls with drugs.\nBut something has to be done, we\nCan't have everybody running around\nDoing just what they please, like a\nBunch of anarchists.\n\nBARZINI\nThen, are we agreed; the traffic in\nDrugs will be permitted, but\nControlled; and Don Corleone agrees\nTo give it protection in the East.\n\nDON CORLEONE nods.\n\nBARZINI\nThat's the whole matter then, we\nHave the peace, and let me pay my\nRespects to Don Corleone, whom we\nHave all known over the years as a\nMan of his word.\n(noticing TATTAGLIA\nIs uneasy)\nDon Philip?\n\nTATTAGLIA\nI agree to everything here, I'm\nWilling to forget my own misfortune.\nBut I must hear strict assurance\nFrom Corleone. When time goes by\nAnd his position becomes stronger,\nWill he attempt any individual\nVengeance?\n\nThey all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that\nDON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something\nElse in mind. Slowly the DON rises.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI forego my vengeance for my dead\nSon, for the common good. But I\nHave selfish reasons. My youngest\nSon had to flee, accused of\nSollozzo's murder, and I must now\nMake arrangements so that he can\nCome home with safety, cleared of\nAll those false charges. That is\nMy affair, and I will make those\nArrangements.\n(with strength)\nBut I am a superstitious man...and\nSo if some unlucky accident should\nBefall my youngest son, if some\nPolice officer should accidentally\nShoot him, or if he should hang\nHimself in his cell, or if my son\nIs struck by a bolt of lightning,\nThen I will blame some of the\nPeople here. That, I could never\nForgive, but...aside from that, let\nMe swear by the souls of my\nGrandchildren that I will never be\nThe one to break the peace we have\nMade.\n\nEXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe DON's black limousine. He sits quietly in the padded\nRear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.\n\nIt is night. Lights flash by them every so often.\n\nHAGEN\nWhen I meet with Tattaglia's\nPeople; should I insist that all\nHis drug middle-men be clean?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMention it, don't insist. Barzini\nIs a man who will know that without\nBeing told.\n\nHAGEN\nYou mean Tattaglia.\n\nDON CORLEONE\n(shaking his head)\nBarzini.\n\nHAGEN\n(a revelation)\nHe was the one behind Sollozzo?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTattaglia is a pimp. He could\nNever have outfought Santino. But\nI wasn't sure until this day. No,\nIt was Barzini all along.\n\nThe black limousine speeds away from us in the night.\n\n------------------------------------------FADE OUT------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT\n\nA CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and\nDowncast, the left side of his face healed, but left\nGrotesque and misshapen.\n\nGRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea\nJacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.\n\nTHE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on\nEither side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his\nShoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple\nHonest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable,\nAnd with a pleasing build. Each of the SHEPHERDS carry\nKnapsacks.\n\nThe THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape,\nOverlooking an impressive view of land and sea.\n\nEXT DAY: SICILY ROAD\n\nThe THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make\nTheir way to a dusty rural road. We HEAR a rinky horn\nSound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.\nAn OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL. The\nCar pulls in front of them and stops. MICHAEL nods\nRespectfully.\n\nMICHAEL\nDon Tommassino.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nMichael, why must you do this. We\nHave been lucky so far, all these\nMonths you've been here we've kept\nYour name a secret. It is from\nLove for your father that I've\nAsked you never to more than an\nHour from the Villa.\n\nMICHAEL\nCalo and Fabrizzio are with me;\nNothing will happen.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nYou must understand that your\nFather's enemies have friends in\nPalermo.\n\nMICHAEL\nI know.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nWhere are you going?\n\nMICHAEL\nCorleone.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nThere is nothing there. Not anymore.\n\nMICHAEL\nI was told that my Grandfather was\nMurdered on its main street; and\nHis murderers came to kill my\nFather there when he was twelve\nYears old.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nLong ago. Now there is nothing:\nThe men killed each other in family\nVendettas...the others escaped to\nAmerica.\n\nMICHAEL\nDon Tommassino...I should see this\nPlace.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nThat is your birthright...but\nMichael, use this car.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo...I would like to walk to\nCorleone.\n\nThe OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nBe careful Michael, don't let them\nKnow your name.\n\nThe old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues\nOn his journey.\n\nEXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE\n\nThe THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit\nTrees, in bloom and bursting with life.\n\nEXT DAY: VILLAGE\n\nThey continue in the empty streets of a little town; the\nPost-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the\nEmpty streets. Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only\nGasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass. And there\nAre many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.\n\nThe THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main\nRoad \"VOTA COMMUNISTA\".\n\nEXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD\n\nThey continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally\nA donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.\n\nEXT DAY: FIELD\n\nOut in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession\nOf peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong,\nMarching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men\nCarrying billowing red banners.\n\nEXT DAY: GROVE\n\nThey are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees\nIs a deep, tall field of wild flowers.\n\nThe Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out\nLoaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.\n\nMICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nYou tell us about America.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow do you know I come from America?\n\nFABRIZZIO\nWe hear. We were told you were a\nPezzonovanta...big shot.\n\nMICHAEL\nOnly the son of a Pezzonovanta.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nHey America! Is she as rich as\nThey say?\n\nMICHAEL\nYes.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nTake me to America! You need a\nGood lupara in America?\n(pats his shotgun)\nYou take me, I'll be the best man\nYou got. \"Oh say, can you\nSeeee...By da star early light...\"\n\nMICHAEL laughs.\n\nEXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD\n\nThe TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military\nConvoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of\nThe U.S. drivers, as they move by.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nAmerica.\nHey America!\nTake me with you!\nHey, take me to America G.I.!\n\nEXT DAY: CORLEONE HILL\n\nThey continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until\nThey hesitate, and look down.\n\nCALO\nCorleone.\n\nThey can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.\n\nEXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET\n\nMICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of\nThe village. They walk behind him, and spread to either\nSide about fifteen feet away from him.\n\nThey move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.\nMICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.\nThey go on.\n\nThey move up a very narrow old street. MICHAEL looks at the\nDoorways that they pass.\n\nMOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.\n\nCALO sees MICHAEL looking.\n\nCALO\nThe names of the dead.\n\nMICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street. He looks.\n\nThe street is empty, barren. Occasionally, an old woman\nWill pass.\n\nMICHAEL turns his head.\n\nThe other side of the street: empty and deathly.\n\nA HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old\nStreet, the shepherds a respectful distance away.\n\n-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------\n\nEXT DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE\n\nA green ribboned field of a baronial Estate. Further ahead\nIs a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been\nDiscovered in the ruins of Pompeii. There is a group of\nYoung village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,\nDressed in black. They have been gathering the pink sulla,\nPurple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon\nBlossoms. They are singing, off in the distance as they work.\n\nMICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this\nFantasy-like scene.\n\nFABRIZZIO\n(calling out to them)\nHey, beautiful girls!\n\nMICHAEL\n(sternly)\nShhhhh.\n\nHe settles down to watch.\n\nThe GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that\nCling to their bodies. They are still in their teens, but\nDeveloped and womanly.\n\nThey are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not\nAware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.\nThree or four of the girls begin chasing one of them\nPlayfully, in the direction of the grove.\n\nThe GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her\nLeft hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws\nThem back at her pursuers laughing.\n\nThey come closer and closer. Just short of the grove, she\nPoses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the\nView of the THREE MEN. She stands there on her toes about\nTo run.\n\nMICHAEL sees her; now face to face. He looks.\n\nHer face. Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair\nAnd a rich mouth.\n\nFABRIZZIO\n(murmuring)\nJesus Christ, take my soul. I'm\nDying.\n\nQuickly, she turns, and runs away.\n\nMICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her. We hold\nOn him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS\nLaughing. Then he turns to them.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nYou got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?\n\nCALO pats him on the shoulder.\n\nCALO\nEasy man.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nFABRIZZIO\nYou can't hide it when you're hit\nBy the thunderbolt.\n\nEXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE\n\nThe little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate,\nIs decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.\n\nMICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central\nSquare, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.\n\nThe proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man;\nHe greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at\nTheir table.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nYou know all the girls in this\nTown, eh? We saw some beauties\nComing down the road. One in\nParticular got our friend hit with\nThe Thunderbolt...\n(he indicates MICHAEL)\n\nVITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with\nNew interest.\n\nVITELLI\nYou had better bring a few bottles\nHome with you, my friend; you'll\nNeed help sleeping tonight.\n(he laughs)\n\nFABRIZZIO\nThis one could seduce the devil. A\nBody! and eyes as big and black as\nOlives.\n\nVITELLI\n(laughing with\nThem...pouring more wine)\nI know about what you mean!\n\nFABRIZZIO\nThis was a beauty. Right, Calo?\n\nVITELLI\n(laughing)\nBeautiful all over, eh?\n\nFABRIZZIO\nAnd hair. Black and curly, like a\nDoll. And such a mouth.\n\nVITELLI does not laugh quite so much.\n\nVITELLI\nYes, we have beautiful girls here...\nBut virtuous.\n\nVITELLI is no longer drinking with them.\n\nMICHAEL\nShe wore a red dress, and a red\nRibbon in her hair. She looks more\nGreek than Italian. Do you know a\nBeauty like that?\n\nAs MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less,\nUntil he wears a scowl.\n\nVITELLI\nNo.\n\nThen he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nGod in Heaven, I think I\nUnderstand...\n\nHe goes into the back room after the innkeeper. Then he\nReturns.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nLet's get out of here; he's boiling\nUp his blood to do us mischief.\nIt's his daughter.\n\nThey start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.\n\nCALO\nCome quickly.\n\nMICHAEL\nInnkeeper. More wine!\n\nFABRIZZIO\n(whispered)\nThe old bastard mentioned two sons\nHe only has to whistle up.\n\nMICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.\n\nMICHAEL\nTell him to come to me.\n\nThe two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in\nA moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI\nBetween them.\n\nMICHAEL\n(quietly)\nI understand I've offended you by\nTalking about your daughter. I\nOffer you my apologies, I'm a\nStranger in this country, I don't\nKnow the customs very well. Let me\nSay this, I meant no disrespect to\nYou or her...\n\nCALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.\n\nVITELLI\n(shrugs)\nWho are you and what do you want\nFrom my daughter?\n\nMICHAEL\nI am an American hiding in Sicily\nFrom the police of my country. My\nName is Michael. You can inform\nThe police and make your fortune\nBut then your daughter would lose a\nFather rather than gain a husband.\nIn any case, I want to meet your\nDaughter. With your permission and\nUnder the supervision of your\nFamily. With all decorum. With\nAll respect. I am an honorable man.\n\nCALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then\nAsks:\n\nVITELLI\nAre you a friend of the friends?\n\nMICHAEL\nWhen the proper time comes, I'll\nTell you everything that a wife's\nFather should know.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nIt's the real Thunderbolt, then.\n\nVITELLI\n(formally)\nCome Sunday morning: My name is\nVitelli and my house is up there on\nThe hill, above the village.\n\nMICHAEL\nYour daughter's name?\n\nVITELLI\nAppolonia.\n\n-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------\n\nEXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD\n\nMUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from\nPalermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an\nAlfa Romeo. CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday\nBest, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their\nLuparas on their shoulders.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off,\nRocky and bouncing on the dirt road.\n\nThe Sunday churchbells ring.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE\n\nMICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by\nThe yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the\nMOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.\nFinally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate\nSunday clothing. Now he presents the wrapped gift to\nAPPOLONIA. She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives\nHer permission to open it. She unwraps it. Her eyes light\nAt the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.\n\nShe looks at him.\n\nAPPOLONIA\nGrazia.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE\n\nNow the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's\nCafe.\n\nMICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS,\nThough they are all dressed differently.\n\nThey go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is\nTalking and talking.\n\nMICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.\nShe wears the gold necklace around her neck.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME\n\nMICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path,\nSeemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.\n\nAs the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a\nHalf dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces\nFurther behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on\nTheir shoulders.\n\nFurther up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone,\nAnd falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm. She modestly regains\nHer balance, and they continue walking.\n\nBehind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH\n\nChurch bells in an ancient belfry ring out. Music, old and\nDissonant, plays.\n\nThere is a bridal procession in the street of the village;\nThe same in feeling and texture as it might have been five\nHundred years ago.\n\nDonkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant\nFlowers; children carrying candles and wearing white\nConfirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by\nCountless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.\n\nWe present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with\nAll the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in\nSicily.\n\nAPPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome\nDespite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE\n\nCALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the\nGreat wedding celebration. It is held in the Village\nSquare; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the\nTops of buildings, carrying luparas.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nINT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA\n\nMICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight\nFills the room.\n\nHe turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA. A\nLittle frightened; but lovely.\n\nHe moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her,\nLooking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.\n\nSlowly and tenderly he kisses her. Her tiny hands come up\nTo his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.\n\nShe lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.\n\n--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------\n\nINT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA\n\nMorning. MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the\nRoom.\n\nAPPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially\nCovered by the bedsheets.\n\nHe looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.\n\nEXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD\n\nHIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA\n\nWe HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving\nErratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost\nHitting th inner court wall.\n\nAPPOLONIA is laughing, driving. MICHAEL pretends to be\nFrightened, as he teaches her to drive.\n\nOutside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking\nGuard duty.\n\nThe car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.\n\nMICHAEL\nIt's safer to teach you English.\n\nAPPOLONIA\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday,\nThursday, Friday...See, I learned\nIt. Now teach me to drive!\n\nDON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard. He seems tired and\nConcerned.\n\nMICHAEL\nCiao, Don Tommassino.\n\nAPPOLONIA kisses him.\n\nMICHAEL\nThings went badly in Palermo?\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nThe younger men have no respect.\nThings are changing; I don't know\nWhat will happen. Michael, because\nOf the wedding, people now know\nYour name.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs that why there are more men on\nThe walls?\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nEven so, I don't think it is safe\nHere anymore. I've made plans to\nMove you to a villa near Siracuse.\nYou must go right away.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat is it?\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nBad news from America. Your\nBrother, Santino. He has been\nKilled.\n\nFor a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the\nFive Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.\n\nEXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD\n\nMorning. MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.\n\nBelow, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs,\nCombing his thick hair.\n\nMICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.\n\nMICHAEL\nGet the car. I'll be leaving in\nTen minutes. Where's Calo?\n\nFABRIZZIO\nCalo is having a cup of coffee in\nThe kitchen. Is your wife coming\nWith you?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, she's going home to her family.\nShe'll join me in a few weeks...\n\nINT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN\n\nMICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the\nKitchen. CALO is just finishing a bite. He rises when he\nSees MICHAEL.\n\nCALO\nShould I get your bag?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, I'll get it. Where's Appolonia?\n\nCALO\n(smiling)\nShe is sitting in the driver's seat\nOf the car, dying to step on the\nGas. She'll be a real American\nWoman before she gets to America.\n\nMICHAEL smiles.\n\nMICHAEL\nTell Fabrizzio and wait for me in\nThe car.\n\nHe leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.\n\nHe looks out from the opening in the doorway.\n\nEXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD\n\nThere is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's\nSeat, playing with the wheel like a child.\n\nCALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear\nSeat.\n\nThen MICHAEL seems disturbed.\n\nOver, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO\nDisappear through the gate.\n\nMICHAEL\n(muttering to himself)\nWhere the hell is he going?\n\nMICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.\n\nMICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer\nCourtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.\n\nAPPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay\nWhere he is.\n\nAPPOLONIA\n(calling out)\nI'll drive to you.\n\nHe smiles affectionately.\n\nCALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling\nBy his side. There is no sight of FABRIZZIO. Suddenly the\nSmile fades from MICHAEL's face. He steps forward and holds\nOut his hand.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. No!\n\nHis shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION,\nAs she switched on the ignition.\n\nPart of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off;\nAnd there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.\n\nMICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.\n\nINT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM\n\nMICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room. We hear\nWhispering around him, but can't make any of it out. A soft\nCloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open. DON\nTOMMASSINO is there, close to him. He looks at them and\nFrom their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.\n\nMICHAEL\nFabrizzio. Let your shepherds know\nThat the one who gives me Fabrizzio\nWill own the finest pastures in\nSicily.\n\n--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)\n\nEaster.\n\nA HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime. Hordes\nOf little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children\nAnd Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets,\nSearching here and there for candy treasures and hidden\nEaster eggs.\n\nThe DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing\nBaggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around\nHis garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.\n\nSuddenly, he stops and looks.\n\nMICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.\n\nGreat emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in\nMICHAEL's direction.\n\nMICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son\nAnd embraces him.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBe my son...\n\nINT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY\n\nDON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the\nBuilding.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThis old building has seen its day.\nNo way to do business...too small,\nToo old.\n\nThey enter the DON's glass-panelled office.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nHave you thought about a wife? A\nFamily?\n\nMICHAEL\n(pained)\nNo.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI understand, Michael. But you\nMust make a family, you know.\n\nMICHAEL\nI want children, I want a family.\nBut I don't know when.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAccept what's happened, Michael.\n\nMICHAEL\nI could accept everything that's\nHappened; I could accept it, but\nThat I never had a choice. From\nThe time I was born, you had laid\nThis all out for me.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo, I wanted other things for you.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou wanted me to be your son.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYes, but sons who would be\nProfessors, scientists,\nMusicians...and grandchildren who\nCould be, who knows, a Governor, a\nPresident even, nothing's impossible\nHere in America.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen why have I become a man like\nYou?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou are like me, we refuse to be\nFools, to be puppets dancing on a\nString pulled by other men. I\nHoped the time for guns and killing\nAnd massacres was over. That was\nMy misfortune. That was your\nMisfortune. I was hunted on the\nStreets of Corleone when I was\nTwelve years old because of who my\nFather was. I had no choice.\n\nMICHAEL\nA man has to choose what he will be.\nI believe that.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat else do you believe in?\n\nMICHAEL doesn't answer.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBelieve in a family. Can you\nBelieve in your country? Those\nPezzonovante of the State who\nDecide what we shall do with our\nLives? Who declare wars they wish\nUs to fight in to protect what they\nOwn. Do you put your fate in the\nHands of men whose only talent is\nThat they tricked a bloc of people\nTo vote for them? Michael, in five\nYears the Corleone family can be\nCompletely legitimate. Very\nDifficult things have to happen to\nMake that possible. I can't do\nThem anymore, but you can, if you\nChoose to.\n\nMICHAEL listens.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBelieve in a family; believe in a\nCode of Honor, older and higher,\nBelieve in Roots that go back\nThousands of years into your Race.\nMake a family, Michael, and protect\nIt. These are our affairs, sono cosa\nNostra, Governments only protect\nMen who have their own individual\nPower. Be one of those men...you\nHave the choice.\n\n--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------\n\nEXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS (1955)\n\nA MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.\n\nFREDO (O.S.)\nThere's a new one. Construction\nGoing on everywhere.\n\nMORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the\nBill marquees read: \"MARTIN AND LEWIS\", \"PATTI PAGE\", etc.\n\nFREDO (O.S.)\nThat's one of the family's new ones.\nNot bad, eh?\n\nEXT DAY: FLAMINGO (1955)\n\nThe car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel.\n\nInside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man,\nNERI, quiet and sinister.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy didn't Moe Green meet us at the\nAirport?\n\nFREDO\nHe had business at the hotel, but\nHe'll drop in for dinner.\n\nFrom the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a\nDiscourtesy.\n\nINT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955)\n\nA whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of\nMICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI. Great fuss is made. They are\nBeing shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.\n\nFREDO\nYou look wonderful, kid; really\nWonderful. That doctor did some\nJob on your face.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou look good, too.\n\nThey enter the suite.\n\nFREDO\nNice, eh?\n\nFREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the\nBellboys, waiters and maids.\n\nFREDO\n(hurrying into the bedroom)\nKid, take a look-see.\n\nMICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom.\n\nThere is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform,\nMirrors to each side. FREDO points upward.\n\nA VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.\n\nFREDO\nEver seen anything like that before?\n\nMICHAEL\n(dryly)\nNo.\n\nINT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM (1955)\n\nMICHAEL is alone in the bedroom. He is just finishing\nDressing; he puts on his jacket. From the window, with the\nLights blinking, we can tell it's late at night. MICHAEL\nPasses into the other room.\n\nHe stops, looks. He is disturbed.\n\nINT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)\n\nA magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite;\nA lavish table setting for eight. Standing by the table are\nHAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier,\nBeautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.\nNERI stands quietly by the door.\n\nFREDO\nMike! The party starting!\n\nMICHAEL\nCome here a minute, Fredo.\n\nFREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.\n\nMICHAEL\nWho are those girls?\n\nFREDO\n(jokingly)\nThat's for you to find out.\n\nMICHAEL\nGive them some money and send them\nHome.\n\nFREDO\nMike!\n\nMICHAEL\nGet rid of them...\n\nINT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)\n\nThey are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite.\nMICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY.\n\nMICHAEL\nJohnny, the Corleone family is\nThinking of selling out all our\nInterests in the Olive Oil business\nAnd settling here. Moe Greene will\nSell us his interest so it can be\nWholly owned by friends of the\nFamily.\n\nFREDDIE seems anxious.\n\nFREDO\nMike, you sure about Moe selling.\nHe never mentioned it to me and he\nLoves the business.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll make him an offer he can't refuse.\n\nMICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.\n\nMICHAEL\nJohnny, the Don wants you to help\nUs get started. We figure\nEntertainment will be the big\nFactor in drawing gamblers. We\nHope you'll sign a contract to\nAppear five times a year for maybe\nA week long engagement.\nWe hope your friends in the movies\nWill do the same. We count on you\nTo convince them.\n\nJOHNNY\nSure, I'll do anything for my\nGodfather. You know that, Mike.\n\nThere is knock on the door. NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL,\nWho nods. NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters,\nFollowed by TWO BODYGUARDS. He is a handsome hood, dressed\nIn the Hollywood style. His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast\nStyle.\n\nMOE\nMike, good to see you. Got\nEverything you want?\n\nMICHAEL\nThanks.\n\nMOE\nThe chef cooked for you special;\nThe dancers will kick your tongue\nOut and you credit is good!\n(to his BODYGUARDS)\nDraw chips for all these people so\nThey can play on the house.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs my credit good enough to buy you\nOut?\n\nMOE laughs.\n\nMOE\nBuy me out?...\n\nMICHAEL\nThe hotel, the casino. The Corleone\nFamily wants to buy you out.\n\nGREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense. NERI eyes\nThe BODYGUARDS.\n\nMOE\n(furious)\nThe Corleone family wants to buy me\nOut. I buy you out. You don't buy\nMe out.\n\nMICHAEL\nYour casino loses money. Maybe we\nCan do better.\n\nMOE\nYou think I scam?\n\nMICHAEL\n(the worst insult)\nYou're unlucky.\n\nMOE\nYou goddamn dagos. I do you a\nFavor and take Freddie in when\nYou're having a bad time, and then\nYou try to push me out.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou took Freddie in because the\nCorleone family bankrolled your\nCasino. You and the Corleone\nFamily are evened out. This is for\nBusiness; name your price.\n\nMOE\nThe Corleone family don't have that\nKind of muscle anymore. The\nGodfather is sick. You're getting\nChased out of New York by Barzini\nAnd the other families, and you\nThink you can find easier pickings\nHere. I've talked to Barzini; I\nCan make a deal with him and keep\nMy hotel!\n\nMICHAEL\n(quietly, deadly)\nIs that why you thought you could\nSlap Freddie around in public?\n\nFREDO\n(his face turns red)\nAh Mike, that was nothing. Moe\nDidn't mean anything. He flies off\nThe handle sometimes; but me and\nHim are good friends. Right, Moe?\n\nMOE\nYeah sure. Sometimes I gotta kick\nAsses to make this place run right.\nFreddie and I had a little argument\nAnd I had to straighten him out.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou straightened my brother out?\n\nMOE\nHell, he was banging cocktail\nWaitresses two at a time. Players\nCouldn't get a drink.\n\nMICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:\n\nMICHAEL\nI have to go back to New York\nTomorrow. Think of your price.\n\nMOE\nYou son of a bitch, you think you\nCan brush me off like that? I made\nMy bones when you were going out\nWith cheerleaders.\n\nFREDO\n(frightened)\nTom, you're the Consigliere; you\nCan talk to the Don and advise him.\n\nMICHAEL\nThe Don has semi-retired. I'm\nRunning the Family business now.\nSo anything you have to say, say it\nTo me.\n\nNobody answers. MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door.\nMOE exits angrily.\n\nMICHAEL\nFreddie, you're my older brother.\nI love you. But don't ever take\nSides with anybody against the\nFamily again.\n\nEXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955)\n\nKAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark\nAIRPORT. ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.\n\nShe has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who\nPlays with a cardboard bird on a string.\n\nTwo other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have\nLearned to tell are bodyguards.\n\nMICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO\nPORTERS carrying luggage.\n\nNERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.\n\nMICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.\n\nLAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and\nMICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son. Automatically,\nThe luggage is put in. NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver;\nAnd LAMPONE joins the other men. HAGEN gets into one of the\nOther cars.\n\nAnd the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other\nSedans.\n\nINT DAY: LIMO (1955)\n\nThe little BOY looks out the window as they drive.\n\nMICHAEL\nI have to see my father and his\nPeople when we get back to the Mall.\n\nKAY\nOh Michael.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe'll go to the show tomorrow\nNight--we can change the tickets.\n\nKAY\nDon't you want dinner first?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, you eat...don't wait up for me.\n\nKAY\nWake me up when you come to bed?\n\nThe little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding\nLimousine window.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nThe limousine arrives at the Mall. We are inside.\n\nKAY\nYour sister wants to ask you\nSomething.\n\nMICHAEL\nLet HER ask.\n\nNERI opens the door. KAY wants to talk just a little more.\n\nKAY\nShe's afraid to. Michael...\n\nMICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment\nLonger.\n\nKAY\nWhy are you so cold to her and\nCarlo? They live with us on the\nMall now, but you never get close\nTo them.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm busy.\n\nKAY\nConnie and Carlo want you to be\nGodfather to their little boy.\n\nNERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.\n\nHe smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.\n\nKAY\nWill you?\n\nMICHAEL\nLet me think about it, O.K.?\n\nShe smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY\nAnd the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955)\n\nVIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size. He\nWears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt. He sits in a\nChair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.\n\nTESSIO (O.S.)\nBarzini's people chisel my territory\nAnd we do nothing about it. Pretty\nSoon there won't be one place in\nBrooklyn I can hang my hat.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nJust be patient.\n\nTESSIO\nI'm not asking you for help, Mike.\nJust take off the handcuffs.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nBe patient.\n\nCLEMENZA (O.S.)\nWe gotta fight sometime. Let us at\nLeast recruit our regimes to full\nStrength.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nNo, I don't want to give Barzini an\nExcuse to start fighting.\n\nTESSIO (O.S.)\nMike, you're wrong.\n\nCLEMENZA (O.S.)\nDon Corleone...Don Corleone.\n\nThe OLD MAN looks up. CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.\nBeside him is an anxious TESSIO. NERI stands by the door;\nHAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.\n\nCLEMENZA\nYou said there would come a day\nWhen Tessio and me could form our\nOwn Families. Only with your\nBenediction, of course. I ask\nPermission...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMy son is head of the Family now.\nIf you have his permission, you\nHave my good will.\n\nMICHAEL\nIn six months you can break off\nFrom the Corleone Family and go on\nYour own. Carlo, I'm counting on\nYou to make the move to Nevada;\nYou'll be my right-hand man out\nThere. Tom Hagen is no longer the\nConsigliere.\n\nEveryone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.\nHe remains inexpressive.\n\nMICHAEL\nHe's going to be our lawyer in\nVegas. Nobody goes to him with any\nOther business as of now, this\nMinute. No reflection on Tom;\nThat's the way I want it. Besides,\nIf I ever need any advice, who's a\nBetter Consigliere than my father.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThen in a six month time we're on\nOur own; is that it?\n\nMICHAEL\nMaybe less...\n\nTESSIO\nLet us fill up our Regimes.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. I want things very calm for\nAnother six months.\n\nTESSIO\nForgive me, Godfather, let our\nYears of friendship be my excuse.\nHow can you hope for success there\nWithout your strength here to back\nYou up? The two go hand in hand.\nAnd with you gone from here the\nBarzini and the Tattaglias will be\nToo strong for us.\n\nCLEMENZA\nAnd I don't like Barzini. I say\nThe Corleone Family has to move\nFrom strength, not weakness. We\nShould build our Regimes and take\nBack our lost territories in Staten\nIsland, at least.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nDo you have faith in my judgement?\n\nCLEMENZA\nYes, Godfather...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThen do what Michael says...\n\nMICHAEL\nAll I can say is that things are\nBeing resolved that are more\nEffective than a thousand buttonmen\nOn the streets. Understood?\n\nThere are uneasy looks all around.\n\nCARLO\nUnderstood. I just wish I was\nDoing more to help out.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll come to you when I need you.\n\nHe looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN. They all nod,\nReluctantly.\n\nMICHAEL\nAll right, then it's resolved.\n\nNERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.\n\nCLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,\nThen CARLO. NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the\nCorridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.\n\nThen NERI closes the door.\n\nMICHAEL relaxes.\n\nHAGEN\nMike, why are you cutting me out of\nThe action?\n\nMICHAEL\nTom, we're going to be legitimate\nAll the way, and you're the legal\nMan. What could be more important\nThan that.\n\nHAGEN\nI'm not talking about that. I'm\nTalking about Rocco Lampone building\nA secret regime. Why does Neri\nReport directly to you, rather than\nThrough me or a caporegime?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI told you that it wouldn't escape\nHis eye.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow did you find out?\n\nHAGEN\nBookkeepers know everything.\nRocco's men are all a little too\nGood for the jobs they're supposed\nTo be doing. They get a little\nMore money than the job's worth.\n(pause)\nLampone's a good man; he's operating\nPerfectly.\n\nMICHAEL\nNot so perfectly if you noticed.\n\nHAGEN\nMike, why am I out?\n\nMICHAEL\nYou're not a wartime Consigliere.\nThings may get tough with the move\nWe're trying.\n\nHAGEN\nOK, but then I agree with Tessio.\nYou're going about it all wrong;\nYou're making the move out of\nWeakness... Barzini's a wolf, and\nIf he tears you apart, the other\nFamilies won't come running to help\nThe Corleones...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTom, I never thought you were a bad\nConsigliere, I thought Santino a\nBad Don, rest in peace. He had a\nGood heart but he wasn't the right\nMan to head the family when I had\nMy misfortune. Michael has all my\nConfidence, as you do. For reasons\nWhich you can't know, you must have\nNo part in what will happen.\n\nHAGEN\nMaybe I can help.\n\nMICHAEL\n(coldly)\nYou're out, Tom.\n\nTOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence. TOM\nLeaves.\n\nMICHAEL looks at NERI.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm going to talk to my father.\n\nNERI nods, and then leaves. The DON opens the doors,\nBreathes in the air, and steps outside.\n\nEXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI see you have your Luca Brasi.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll need him.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThere are men in this world who\nDemand to be killed. They argue in\nGambling games; they jump out of\nTheir cars in a rage if someone so\nMuch as scratches their fender.\nThese people wander through the\nStreets calling out \"Kill me, kill\nMe.\" Luca Brasi was like that.\nAnd since he wasn't scared of\nDeath, and in fact, looked for\nIt...I made him my weapon. Because\nI was the only person in the world\nThat he truly hoped would not kill\nHim. I think you have done the\nSame with this man.\n\nThey walk through the DON's vegetable garden. Tomatoes,\nPeppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.\nMICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him. Then\nStoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBarzini will move against you first.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nHe will get in touch with you\nThrough someone you absolutely\nTrust. That person will arrange a\nMeeting, guarantee your safety...\n\nHe rises, and looks at Michael...\n\nDON CORLEONE\n...and at that meeting you will be\nAssassinated.\n\nThe DON walks on further.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYour wife and children...you're\nHappy with them?\n\nMICHAEL\nYes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGood.\n\nMICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:\n\nMICHAEL\nI've always respected you...\n\nA long silence. The DON smiles at MICHAEL.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd I...you.\n\nEXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nKAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left\nThem off.\n\nKAY\nHow is your husband feeling?\n\nMAMA\nHe's not the same since they shot\nHim. He lets Michael do all the\nWork. He just plays the fool with\nHis garden, his peppers, his\nTomatoes, as if he was some peasant\nStill. But men are like that...\n\nShe stops toward the Church.\n\nMAMA\nYou come in, too.\n\nKAY shakes her head.\n\nMAMA\nThe Priest ain't gonna bite you\nCause you're not Catholic.\n(whispered)\nHe's in the back drinkin' his wine.\n\nKAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.\nThey enter.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nInside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from\nThe holy water.\n\nMAMA\nYou can.\n\nTentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and\nBlesses herself. Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in\nAwe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally\nThe Altar.\n\nMAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles. There is a\nLarge coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting\nCandles. MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives\nHer some.\n\nMAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the\nTaper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great\nDignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights\nTwenty candles.\n\nShe finishes, and bows her head.\n\nEXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME\n\nVery few people in the streets. TOTAL SILENCE. But black\nFlower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.\nAn expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.\nCertainly no more could be done for a President or a King.\n\nEach car carries an elaborate floral decoration. We show\nThese in detail; and the flowered messages: \"A Benefactor to\nMankind\", \"He Knew and Pitied\"...\"Our Don Our Leader\"...\"The\nSacred Heart\"...\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nHIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL\n\nSilence.\n\nThe flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill\nAll the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.\n\nHundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the\nWedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is\nSomber and respectful.\n\nMICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform\nWhich holds the ornate coffin. We cannot see the remains of\nDon Corleone.\n\nBONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved\nFamily. One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely\nWith grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.\n\nThe VIEW ALTERS,\n\nAnd we see that the line is endless. JOHNNY FONTANE, tears\nOpenly falling, takes his turn.\n\nChildren are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last\nLook at the great man.\n\nCLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE. LAMPONE\nImmediately arranges for the members of the Five New York\nFamilies to pay their respects.\n\nFirst CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI. Then PHILIP\nTATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.\n\nThen BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.\n\nMICHAEL watches the scene.\n\nBARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined\nBy his men.\n\nAs BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on\nHim; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear\nFrom the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that\nHe is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don\nCorleone.\n\nMICHAEL watches silently.\n\nBARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes. First\nCLEMENZA. Then TESSIO.\n\nCONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes. He\nEmbraces and comforts her.\n\nEverywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching\nAll who come close to him.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (LATER)\n\nLater on the Mall; some people have left, although there are\nStill hundreds of mourners.\n\nA young GIRL approaches TESSIO. She's about 18.\n\nGIRL\nDo you remember me?\n\nTESSIO\nNo...\n\nGIRL\nWe danced together at Connie's\nWedding.\n\nTESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown',\nAnd they move though the crowd, looking for Michael. He\nFinds him.\n\nTESSIO\nMike, could I have a minute?\n\nMIKE; nods; and they move to a private place. NERI is close\nBy.\n\nTESSIO\nBarzini wants to arrange a meeting.\nSays we can straighten any of our\nProblems out.\n\nMICHAEL\nHe talked to you?\n\nTESSIO\n(nods)\nI can arrange security.\n\nMICHAEL looks at him.\n\nEXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955)\n\nThe Cemetery. Late day.\n\nThe hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the\nStone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in\nQueens Village.\n\nHundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take\nPictures, etc.\n\nMICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.\n\nMICHAEL\n(softly)\nChrist, Tom; I needed more time\nWith him. I really needed him.\n\nHAGEN\nDid he give you his politicians?\n\nMICHAEL\nNot all...I needed another four\nMonths and I would have had them\nAll.\n(he looks at TOM)\nI guess you've figured it all out?\n\nHAGEN\nHow will they come at you?\n\nMICHAEL\nI know now.\n(a passion wells up\nInside of MICHAEL)\nI'll make them call me Don.\n\nHAGEN\nHave you agreed on a meeting?\n\nMICHAEL\n(nods)\nA week from tonight. In Brooklyn\nOn Tessio's ground, where I'll be\nSafe.\n\nHAGEN looks at him; understands.\n\nMICHAEL\nBut after the Baptism. I've\nDecided to stand as godfather to\nConnie's baby.\n\nThey look up.\n\nThe coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which\nStands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel,\nWith the bold inscription: CORLEONE.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)\n\nALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he\nPulls a small trunk from under his bed. He opens it, and we\nSee in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's\nUniform. He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.\nThen the badge, and the identification card; with his\nPicture on it. Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he\nBegins to dress.\n\nINT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)\n\nMICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in\nTheir room. MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is\nBeginning to take on a matronly look.\n\nINT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)\n\nIn a Long Island motel.\n\nROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it,\nChecks it, and puts it back together.\n\nEXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)\n\nPETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln. He hesitates,\nTakes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then\nGets in, drives off.\n\nEXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nThe Church.\n\nVarious relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the\nChurch. They laugh and talk. A MONSIGNOR is officiating.\nNot all of the participants have arrived yet.\n\nCONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO. She holds the\nInfant; showing him off to interested people.\n\nEXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955)\n\nNERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN\nBuilding. He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a\nPoliceman. He carries a huge flashlight.\n\nEXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955)\n\nLAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort\nMotel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising\n\"ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY\".\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH\n\nThe Church.\n\nCONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and\nMICHAEL stand side by side around the urn.\n\nPRIEST\n(to MICHAEL)\nDo you pledge to guide and protect\nThis child if he is left fatherless?\nDo you promise to shield him\nAgainst the wickedness of the world?\n\nMICHAEL\nYes, I promise.\n\nEXT DAY: FIFTH AVE.\n\nNERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area. He\nContinues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center. On\nHis side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly\nAcross from the main entrance of the building. Slowly he\nApproaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his\nNightstick.\n\nThe DRIVER looks up in surprise.\n\nNERI points to the \"No Parking\" sign.\n\nThe DRIVER turns his head away.\n\nNERI\nOK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or\nYou wanna move?\n\nDRIVER\n(obviously a hood)\nYou better check with your precinct.\n\nNERI\nMove it!\n\nThe DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately,\nAnd hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's\nJacket.\n\nNERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street. Then\nHe crooks a finger at the DRIVER.\n\nNERI\nLet me see you license and\nRegistration.\n\nEXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY\n\nLAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.\nIt parks. A young, pretty GIRL gets out. Quickly, he\nReturns into the room.\n\nINT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)\n\nCLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel. He\nRounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH\n\nThe Church. Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently\nApplies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.\n\nPRIEST\nEphetha...be opened...So you may\nPerceive the fragrance of God's\nSweetness.\n\nEXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955)\n\nThe DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center\nIs arguing with NERI.\n\nNow the DRIVER looks up.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nTWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving\nGlass doors.\n\nNERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass\nDoors. The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of\nBARZINI within them.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH\n\nIn the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL. The PRIEST hands him\nThe infant.\n\nPRIEST\nDo you renounce Satan.\n\nMICHAEL\nI do renounce him.\n\nPRIEST\nAnd all his works?\n\nMICHAEL\nI do renounce them.\n\nINT DAY: MOTEL MURDER (1955)\n\nLAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down\nThe iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.\nPHILIP TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a\nSemi-nude young GIRL leans up.\n\nThey are riddled with gunfire.\n\nINT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)\n\nCLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with\nHis package.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH\n\nThe PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant\nMICHAEL holds.\n\nPRIEST\nDo you wish to be baptized?\n\nMICHAEL\nI do wish to be baptized.\n\nINT DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)\n\nCLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.\n\nHe walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate\nElevator waiting shaft.\n\nThe lights indicate the elevator has arrived.\n\nThe doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with\nThe dapper MOE GREENE.\n\nCLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.\n\nThe PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.\n\nPRIEST\nI christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.\n\nFlash bulbs go off. Everyone is smiles, and crowds around\nMICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO.\n\n--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------\n\nEXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nThe christening party outside the Church.\n\nFour or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to\nReceive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.\n\nEveryone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.\n\nAs the fuss is going on, a car pulls up. LAMPONE gets out\nAnd works his way to MICHAEL. He whispers in his ear. This\nIs the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.\n\nCONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.\n\nCONNIE\nKiss your Godfather.\n\nThe infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an\nExcuse to back away.\n\nMICHAEL\nCarlo...we've had a change in the\nPlans. Mama, Connie, Kay and the\nKids will have to take the trip out\nTo Vegas without us.\n\nCONNIE\nOh Mike, it's our first vacation\nTogether.\n\nCARLO\n(anxious to please)\nJesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...\n\nMICHAEL\nGo back to your house and wait for\nMe...\n\nHe kisses KAY.\n\nMICHAEL\n(to KAY)\nI'll just be a couple of days...\n\nPeople are guided to the correct limousines; they start to\nDrive off.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN\n\nTESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.\n\nHAGEN enters.\n\nHAGEN\nYou'd better make your call to\nBarzini; Michael's ready.\n\nTESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.\n\nTESSIO\nWe're on our way to Brooklyn.\n\nHe hangs up and smiles.\n\nTESSIO\nI hope Mike can get us a good deal\nTonight.\n\nHAGEN\n(gravely)\nI'm sure he will.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nThe TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car. On their\nWay they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.\n\nBUTTON MAN\nThe boss says he'll come in a\nSeparate car. He says for you two\nTo go on ahead.\n\nTESSIO\n(frowning)\nHell, he can't do that. It screws\nUp all my arrangements.\n\nTHREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.\n\nHAGEN\n(gently)\nI can't go with you either, Tessio.\n\nHe flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he\nPanics, and then he accepts it.\n\nTESSIO\n(after the pause)\nTell Mike it was business...I\nAlways liked him.\n\nHAGEN\nHe understands that.\n\nTESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.\n\nTESSIO\n(softly)\nTom, can you get me off the hook?\nFor old times' sake?\n\nHAGEN\nI can't.\n\nHAGEN turns, and walks away from the group. Then about\nTwenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.\n\nTESSIO is led into a waiting car.\n\nHAGEN looks away, and walks off.\n\nINT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\n\nCARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather\nNervously. He moves to the window and looks out.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nMICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,\nLAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.\n\nThey move toward us.\n\nExcitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.\n\nHe wears a broad smile.\n\nCARLO\nGodfather!\n\nMICHAEL\nYou have to answer for Santino.\n\nThe smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish\nAttempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and\nBacks into the living room.\n\nINT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\n\nThe door opens, and the grim party enters.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou fingered Sonny for the Barzini\nPeople. That little farce you\nPlayed out with my sister. Did\nBarzini kid you that would fool a\nCorleone?\n\nCARLO\n(dignity)\nI swear I'm innocent. I swear on\nThe head of my children, I'm\nInnocent. Mike, don't do this to\nMe, please Mike, don't do this to me!\n\nMICHAEL\n(quietly)\nBarzini is dead. So is Philip\nTattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo\nAnd Moe Greene...I want to square\nAll the family accounts tonight.\nSo don't tell me you're innocent;\nAdmit what you did.\n\nCARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.\n\nMICHAEL\n(almost kindly)\nDon't be frightened. Do you think\nI'd make my sister a widow? Do you\nThink I'd make your children\nFatherless? After all, I'm\nGodfather to your son. No, your\nPunishment is that you're out of\nThe family business. I'm putting\nYou on a plane to Vegas--and I want\nYou to stay there. I'll send\nConnie an allowance, that's all.\nBut don't keep saying you're\nInnocent; it insults my intelligence\nAnd makes me angry. Who approached\nYou, Tattaglia or Barzini?\n\nCARLO\n(sees his way out)\nBarzini.\n\nMICHAEL\n(softly)\nGood, good. Leave now; there's a\nCar waiting to take you to the\nAirport.\n\nCARLO moves to the door; opens it. There is a car waiting;\nWith a group of MEN around it.\n\nHe looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll call your wife and tell her\nWhat flight you're on.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL\n\nCARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his\nThings in the trunk.\n\nONE opens the front door for him.\n\nSOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.\n\nCARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back\nTo see the other man.\n\nIt is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.\n\nThe motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA\nSuddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck. He chokes\nAnd leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.\n\nThe garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.\n\nHis thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.\n\nThen the body goes slack.\n\nCLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car\nDrives off.\n\nEXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955)\n\nMICHAEL and his party. They watch.\n\nThen he turns and walks off, and they follow.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955)\n\nMICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving.\n\nThey do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights\nFlash by.\n\nNERI turns back.\n\nNERI\nYou know I would never question\nAnything you say.\n\nMICHAEL\n(smiles)\nSpeak your mind.\n\nNERI\nI'll do this for you; you know I\nShould.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. This I have to do.\n\nEXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)\n\nMICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an\nItalian Pizzeria. NERI opens the door.\n\nMICHAEL\nSit in the car.\n\nINT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)\n\nHe walks alone into the restaurant. A MAN is tossing pizza\nDough in the air.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhere's the boss?\n\nMAN\nIn the back. Hey Frank, someone\nWants you.\n\nA MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.\n\nMAN\nWhat is it?\n\nHe stops, frozen in fear. It is FABRIZZIO.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL. Gunfire from under his coat. FABRIZZIO is\nCut down. MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nHIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL\n\nSeveral moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that\nThese are the final days; the families are moving out; signs\nIndicating that the property is for sale are evident.\n\nA black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped,\nThe rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out,\nRestrained by MAMA. She manages to break free and runs\nAcross the Mall into Michael's house.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\n\nInside the Corleone house. Big boxes have been packed;\nFurniture prepared for shipping.\n\nCONNIE\nMichael!\n\nShe hurries into the living room, where she comes upon\nMICHAEL and KAY.\n\nKAY\n(comforting)\nConnie...\n\nBut CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL. NERI\nIs watchful.\n\nCONNIE\nYou lousy bastard; you killed my\nHusband...\n\nKAY\nConnie...\n\nCONNIE\nYou waited until our father died\nAnd nobody could stop you and you\nKilled him, you killed him! You\nBlamed him about Sonny, you always\nDid, everybody did. But you never\nThought about me, never gave a damn\nAbout me.\n(crying)\nWhat am I going to do now, what am\nI going to do.\n\nTWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders\nFrom him. But he stands there, waiting for his sister to\nFinish.\n\nKAY\nConnie, how could you say such\nThings?\n\nCONNIE\nWhy do you think he kept Carlo on\nThe Mall? All the time he knew he\nWas going to kill my husband. But\nHe didn't dare while my father was\nAlive. And then he stood Godfather\nTo our child. That coldhearted\nBastard.\n(to KAY)\nAnd do you know how many men he had\nKilled with Carlo? Just read the\nPapers. That's your husband.\n\nShe tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria\nShe has no saliva.\n\nMICHAEL\nGet her home and get a doctor.\n\nThe TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her,\nGently but firmly.\n\nKAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from\nMICHAEL. He feels her look.\n\nMICHAEL\nShe's hysterical.\n\nBut KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.\n\nKAY\nMichael, it's not true. Please\nTell me.\n\nMICHAEL\nDon't ask me.\n\nKAY\nTell me!\n\nMICHAEL\nAll right, this one time I'll let\nYou ask about my affairs, one last\nTime.\n\nKAY\nIs it true?\n\nShe looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so\nDirectly that we know he will tell the truth.\n\nMICHAEL\n(after a very long pause)\nNo.\n\nKAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs\nHim. Then she kisses him.\n\nKAY\n(through her tears)\nWe both need a drink.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)\n\nShe moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the\nDrinks. From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the\nDrinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the\nHouse with their BODYGUARDS.\n\nShe watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive\nThem. He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one\nFoot slightly behind the other. One hand on his hip, like a\nRoman Emperor. The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.\n\nCLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.\n\nCLEMENZA\nDon Corleone...\n\nThe smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her\nHusband has become.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nKAY wears a shawl over her hand. She drops many coins in\nThe coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in\nA pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles.\n\nTHE END3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count":

"Emily-bronte", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Emily-bronte"}, "artist": "Emily Bront\u00eb", "lyrics": "Wuthering Heights (Chap. 20) LyricsTo obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton commissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine\u2019s pony; and, said he\u2014\u2018As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or bad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she cannot associate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious to visit the Heights.  Merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly, and he has been obliged to leave us.\u2019\n\nLinton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o\u2019clock, and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling; but I softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see him so much, he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey.\n\n\u2018My father!\u2019 he cried, in strange perplexity.  \u2018Mamma never told me I had a father.  Where does he live?  I\u2019d rather stay with uncle.\u2019\n\n\u2018He lives a little distance from the Grange,\u2019 I replied; \u2018just beyond those hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get hearty.  And you should be glad to go home, and to see him.  You must try to love him, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.\u2019\n\n\u2018But why have I not heard of him before?\u2019 asked Linton.  \u2018Why didn\u2019t mamma and he live together, as other people do?\u2019\n\n\u2018He had business to keep him in the north,\u2019 I answered, \u2018and your mother\u2019s health required her to reside in the south.\u2019\n\u2018And why didn\u2019t mamma speak to me about him?\u2019 persevered the child.  \u2018She often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago.  How am I to love papa?  I don\u2019t know him.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, all children love their parents,\u2019 I said.  \u2018Your mother, perhaps, thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you.  Let us make haste.  An early ride on such a beautiful morning is much preferable to an hour\u2019s more sleep.\u2019\n\n\u2018Is she to go with us,\u2019 he demanded, \u2018the little girl I saw yesterday?\u2019\n\n\u2018Not now,\u2019 replied I.\n\n\u2018Is uncle?\u2019 he continued.\n\n\u2018No, I shall be your companion there,\u2019 I said.\n\nLinton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.\n\n\u2018I won\u2019t go without uncle,\u2019 he cried at length: \u2018I can\u2019t tell where you mean to take me.\u2019\n\nI attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing, and I had to call for my master\u2019s assistance in coaxing him out of bed.  The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy would visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way.  The pure heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of Minny, relieved his despondency after a while.  He began to put questions concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater interest and liveliness.\n\n\u2018Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?\u2019 he inquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.\n\n\u2018It is not so buried in trees,\u2019 I replied, \u2018and it is not quite so large, but you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air is healthier for you\u2014fresher and drier.  You will, perhaps, think the building old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house: the next best in the neighbourhood.  And you will have such nice rambles on the moors.  Hareton Earnshaw\u2014that is, Miss Cathy\u2019s other cousin, and so yours in a manner\u2014will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and, now and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently, walk out on the hills.\u2019\n\n\u2018And what is my father like?\u2019 he asked.  \u2018Is he as young and handsome as uncle?\u2019\n\n\u2018He\u2019s as young,\u2019 said I; \u2018but he has black hair and eyes, and looks sterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether.  He\u2019ll not seem to you so gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still, mind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he\u2019ll be fonder of you than any uncle, for you are his own.\u2019\n\u2018Black hair and eyes!\u2019 mused Linton.  \u2018I can\u2019t fancy him.  Then I am not like him, am I?\u2019\n\n\u2018Not much,\u2019 I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large languid eyes\u2014his mother\u2019s eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.\n\n\u2018How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!\u2019 he murmured.  \u2018Has he ever seen me?  If he has, I must have been a baby.  I remember not a single thing about him!\u2019\n\n\u2018Why, Master Linton,\u2019 said I, \u2018three hundred miles is a great distance; and ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person compared with what they do to you.  It is probable Mr. Heathcliff proposed going from summer to summer, but never found a convenient opportunity; and now it is too late.  Don\u2019t trouble him with questions on the subject: it will disturb him, for no good.\u2019\n\nThe boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate.  I watched to catch his impressions in his countenance.  He surveyed the carved front and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and crooked firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.  But he had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation within.  Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door.  It was half-past six; the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was clearing and wiping down the table.  Joseph stood by his master\u2019s chair telling some tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing for the hayfield.\n\n\u2018Hallo, Nelly!\u2019 said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me.  \u2018I feared I should have to come down and fetch my property myself.  You\u2019ve brought it, have you?  Let us see what we can make of it.\u2019\n\nHe got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping curiosity.  Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three.\n\n\u2018Sure-ly,\u2019 said Joseph after a grave inspection, \u2018he\u2019s swopped wi\u2019 ye, Maister, an\u2019 yon\u2019s his lass!\u2019\n\nHeathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a scornful laugh.\n\n\u2018God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!\u2019 he exclaimed.  \u2018Hav\u2019n\u2019t they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly?  Oh, damn my soul! but that\u2019s worse than I expected\u2014and the devil knows I was not sanguine!\u2019\n\nI bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter.  He did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father\u2019s speech, or whether it were intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that the grim, sneering stranger was his father.  But he clung to me with growing trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff\u2019s taking a seat and bidding him \u2018come hither\u2019 he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.\n\n\u2018Tut, tut!\u2019 said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin.  \u2018None of that nonsense!  We\u2019re not going to hurt thee, Linton\u2014isn\u2019t that thy name?  Thou art thy mother\u2019s child, entirely!  Where is my share in thee, puling chicken?\u2019\n\nHe took off the boy\u2019s cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt his slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton ceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.\n\u2018Do you know me?\u2019 asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the limbs were all equally frail and feeble.\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.\n\n\u2018You\u2019ve heard of me, I daresay?\u2019\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 he replied again.\n\n\u2018No!  What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for me!  You are my son, then, I\u2019ll tell you; and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.  Now, don\u2019t wince, and colour up!  Though it is something to see you have not white blood.  Be a good lad; and I\u2019ll do for you.  Nelly, if you be tired you may sit down; if not, get home again.  I guess you\u2019ll report what you hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this thing won\u2019t be settled while you linger about it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well,\u2019 replied I, \u2018I hope you\u2019ll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or you\u2019ll not keep him long; and he\u2019s all you have akin in the wide world, that you will ever know\u2014remember.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll be very kind to him, you needn\u2019t fear,\u2019 he said, laughing.  \u2018Only nobody else must be kind to him: I\u2019m jealous of monopolising his affection.  And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some breakfast.  Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work.  Yes, Nell,\u2019 he added, when they had departed, \u2018my son is prospective owner of your place, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his successor.  Besides, he\u2019s mine, and I want the triumph of seeing my descendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children to till their fathers\u2019 lands for wages.  That is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate him for the memories he revives!  But that consideration is sufficient: he\u2019s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own.  I have a room up-stairs, furnished for him in handsome style; I\u2019ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from twenty miles\u2019 distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn.  I\u2019ve ordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I\u2019ve arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his associates.  I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the trouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a worthy object of pride; and I\u2019m bitterly disappointed with the whey-faced, whining wretch!\u2019\n\nWhile he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of milk-porridge, and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the homely mess with a look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it.  I saw the old man-servant shared largely in his master\u2019s scorn of the child; though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart, because Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.\n\n\u2018Cannot ate it?\u2019 repeated he, peering in Linton\u2019s face, and subduing his voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard.  \u2018But Maister Hareton nivir ate naught else, when he wer a little \u2019un; and what wer gooid enough for him\u2019s gooid enough for ye, I\u2019s rayther think!\u2019\n\n\u2018I sha\u2019n\u2019t eat it!\u2019 answered Linton, snappishly.  \u2018Take it away.\u2019\n\nJoseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.\n\n\u2018Is there aught ails th\u2019 victuals?\u2019 he asked, thrusting the tray under Heathcliff\u2019s nose.\n\n\u2018What should ail them?\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Wah!\u2019 answered Joseph, \u2018yon dainty chap says he cannut ate \u2019em.  But I guess it\u2019s raight!  His mother wer just soa\u2014we wer a\u2019most too mucky to sow t\u2019 corn for makking her breead.\u2019\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t mention his mother to me,\u2019 said the master, angrily.  \u2018Get him something that he can eat, that\u2019s all.  What is his usual food, Nelly?\u2019\n\nI suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received instructions to prepare some.  Come, I reflected, his father\u2019s selfishness may contribute to his comfort.  He perceives his delicate constitution, and the necessity of treating him tolerably.  I\u2019ll console Mr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff\u2019s humour has taken.  Having no excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while Linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheep-dog.  But he was too much on the alert to be cheated: as I closed the door, I heard a cry, and a frantic repetition of the words\u2014\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t leave me!  I\u2019ll not stay here!  I\u2019ll not stay here!\u2019\n\nThen the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come forth.  I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief guardianship ended.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1014932", "artist_names": "Junior Parker",

"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Ralph-ellison"}, "artist": "Ralph Ellison", "lyrics": "Invisible Man, The Funeral Speech LyricsThe song had ended. Now the top of the little mountain bristled with banners, horns, and uplifted faces. I could look straight down Fifth Avenue to 125th Street, where policemen were lined behind an array of hot-dog wagons and Good Humor carts; and among the carts I saw a peanut vendor standing beneath a street lamp upon which pigeons were gathered, and now I saw him stretch out his arms with his palms turned upwards, and suddenly he was covered, head, shoulders and outflung arms, with fluttering, feasting birds.\n\nSomeone nudged me and I started. It was time for final words. But I had no words and I 'd never been to a Brotherhood funeral and had no idea of a ritual. But they were waiting. I stood there alone, there was no microphone to support me, only the coffin before me upon the backs of its wobbly carpenter's horses.\n\nI looked down into their sun-swept faces, digging for the words, and feeling a futility about it all and an anger. For this they gathered by the thousands. What were they waiting to hear? Why had they come? For what reason that was different from that which had the red-cheeked boy thrill at Clifton's falling to the earth? What did they want and what could they do? Why hadn't they come when they could have stopped it all?\n\n\"What are you waiting for me to tell you?\" I shouted suddenly, my voice strangely crisp in on the windless air. \"What good will it do? What if I say that this isn't a funeral, that it's a holiday celebration, that if you stick around the band will end up playing \"Damit-the-Hell the Fun's All Over'? Or do you expect to see some magic, the dead rise up and walk again? Go home, he's dead as he'll ever die. That's the end in the beginning and there's no encore. There'll be no miracles and there's no one here to preach a sermon. Go home, forget him. He's inside this box, newly dead. Go home and don't think about him. He's dead and you've got all you can do to think about you.\" I paused. They were whispering and looking upward.\n\n\"I've told you to go home,\" I shouted, \"but you keep standing there. Don't you know it's hot out here in the sun? So what if you wait for what little I can tell you? Can I say in twenty minutes what was building twenty-one years and ended in twenty seconds? What are you waiting for , when all I can tell you is his name? And when I tell you, what will you know that you didn't know already, except, perhaps, his name?\"\n\nThey were listening intently, and as though looking not at me, but at the pattern of my voice upon the air.\n\"All right, you do the listening int eh sun and I'll try to tell you int he sun. Then you can go home and forget it. Forget it. His name was Clifton and they shot him down. His name was Clifton and he was tall and some folks thought him handsome. And though he didn't believe it, I think he was. His tight-rolled curls--or call them naps or kinks. He's dead, uninterested, and, except for a few young girls, it doesn't matter...Have you got it? Can you see him?Think of your brother, or your cousin John. His lips were thick with an upward curve at the corners. He often smiled. He had good eyes and a pair of fast hands, and he had a heart. He thought about things and he felt deeply. I won't call him noble because what's such a word to do with one of us? His name was Clifton, Tod Clifton, and, like any man, he was born of women to live awhile and fall and die. So that's his tale to the minute. His name was Clifton and for a while he lived among us and aroused a few hopes in the young manhood of man, and we who knew him loved him and he died. So why are you waiting? You've heard it all. Why wait for more, when all I do is repeat it?\"\n\nThey stood; they listened. They gave no sign.\n\n\"Very well, so I'll tell you. His name was Clifton and he was young and he was a leader and when he fell there was a hole in the heel of his sock and when he stretched forward he seemed not as tall as when he stood. So he died; and we who loved him are gathered here to mourn him. It's as simple as that and as short as that. His name was Clifton and he was black and they shot him. Isn't that enough to tell? Isn't it all you need to know? Isn't that enough to appease your thirst for drama and send you home to sleep it off? Go take a drink and forget it. Or read it in *The Daily News*. His name was Clifton and they shot him, and I was there to see him fall. So I know it as I know it.\n\n\"Here are the facts. He was standing and he fell. He fell and he kneeled. He kneeled and he bled. He bled and he died. He fell in a heap like any man and his blood spilled out like any blood; *red* as any blood, wet as any blood and reflecting the sky and the buildings and the birds and the trees, or your face if you'd look into its dulling mirror--and it dried in the sun as blood dries. That's all. They spilled his blood and he bled. They cut him down and he died; the blood flowed on the walk in a pool, gleamed a while,a nd, after a while, became dull then dusty, then dried. That's the story and that's how it ended. It's an old story and there's been too much blood to excite you. Besides, it's only important when it fills the veins of a living man. Aren't you tired of such stories? Aren't you sick of the blood? Then why listen, why don't you go? It's hot out here. There's the odor of embalming fluid. The beer is cold in the taverns, the saxophones will be mellow at the Savoy; plenty good-laughing-lies will b e told in the barber shops and beauty parlors; and there'll be sermons in two hundred churches in the cool of the evening, and plenty of laughs at the movies. Go listen to 'Amos and Andy' and forget it. Here you have only the same old story. There's not even a young wife up here in red to mourn him. There's nothing to give you that good old frightened feeling. The story's too short and too simple. His name was Clifton, Tod Clifton, and he was unarmed, and his death was as senseless as his life was futile. He had struggled for Brotherhood on a hundred street corners and he thought it would make him more human, but he died like any dog in a road.\"\n\n\"All, all right,\" I called out, feeling desperate. It wasn't the way I wanted it to go, it wasn't political. Brother Jack probably wouldn't approve of it at all, but I had to keep going as I could go.\n\n\"Listen to me standing up here on this so-called mountain!\" I shouted. \"Let me tell it as it truly was! His name was Tod Clifton and he was full of illusions. He thought he was a man when he was only Tod Clifton. He was shot for a simple mistake of judgement and he bled and his blood dried and shortly the crowd trampled out the stains. It was a normal mistake which any are guilty. He thought he was a man and that men were not meant to be pushed around. But it was hot downtown and he forgot his history, he forgot the time and the place. He lost his hold on reality. There was a cop and a waiting audience but he was Tod Clifton and the cops are everywhere. The cop? What about him? He was a cop. A good citizen. But this cop had an itching finger and an eager ear for a word that rhymed with 'trigger', and when Clifton fell he had found it. The Police Special spoke its lines and the rhyme was completed. Just look around you. Look at what he made, look inside you and feel his awful power. It was perfectly natural. The blood ran like blood in a comic book killing, on a comic-book street in a comic-book town on a comic-book day in a comic-book world.\n\n\"Tod Clifton's one with the ages. But what's that to do with you in this heat under this veiled sun? Now he's part of history, and he has received his true freedom. Didn't they scribble his name on a standardized pad. His Race: colored! Religion: unknown, probably born Baptist. Place of birth: U.S. Some southern town. Next of kin: unknown. Address: unknown. Occupation: unemployed. Cause of death (be specific): resisting reality in the form of a .38 caliber revolver in the hands of the arresting officer, on Forty-second between the library and the subway int eh heat of the afternoon, of gunshot wounds received from three bullets, fired at three paces, one bullet entering the right ventricle of the heart, and lodging there, the other severing the spinal ganglia raveling downward to lodge in the pelvis, the other breaking through the back and traveling God knows where.\n\n\"Such was the short bitter life of Brother Tod Clifton. Now he's in this box with the bolts tightening down. He's in the box and we're in there with him, and when I've told you this you can go. It's dark in this box and it's crowded. It has a cracked ceiling and a clogged-up toilet in the hall. It has rats and roaches, and it's far, far too expensive a dwelling. The air is bad and it'll be cold this winter. Tod Clifton is crowded and he needs the room. 'Tell them to get out of the box,' that's what he would say if you could hear him. 'Tell them to get out of the box and go teach the cops to forget that rhyme. Tell them to teach them when they call you *nigger* to make a rhyme with *trigger* it makes the gun backfire.'\n\n\"So there you have it. In a few hours Tod Clifton will be cold bones in the ground, and don't be fooled, for these bones shall not rise again. You and I will  still be int eh box. I don't know if Tod Clifton had a soul. I only know the ache that I feel in my heart, my sense of love, I don't know if you have a soul. I only know that you are men of flesh and blood, and that blood will spill and flesh grow cold. I do not know if all cops are poets, but I know that all cops carry guns with triggers. And I know too how we are labeled. So in the name of Brother Clifton beware of the triggers; go home, keep cool, stay safe away from the sun. Forget him. When he was alive there's only one thing left to tell and I've already told it. His name was Tod Clifton, he believed in Brotherhood, he aroused our hopes and he died.\"\n\nI couldn't go on. Below, they were waiting, hands and handkerchiefs shading their eyes. A preacher stepped up and read something out of his Bible, and I stood looking at the crowd with a sense of failure. I had let it get away from me, had been unable to bring in the political issues. And they stood there sun-beaten and sweat-bathed, listening to me repeat what was known. Now the preacher had finished, and someone signaled the bandmaster and there was solemn music as the pallbearers carried the coffin down the spiraling stairs. The crowd stood still as we walked slowly through. I could feel the bigness of it and the unknowness of it and pent-up tension--whether of tears or anger, I couldn't tell. But as we walked through the and down the hill to the hearse, I could feel it. The crowd sweated and throbbed, and though it was silent, there were many things directed toward me through its eyes. At the curb were the hearse and a few cars, and in a few minute they wee loaded and the crowd was still standing, look on as we carried Tod Clifton away. And as I took one last look I saw not a crowd but the set faces of individual men and women.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1531413", "artist_names": "Mahalia Jackson", "full_title": "Silent Night, Holy Night by\u00a0Mahalia\u00a0Jackson", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/6a8ebf1d63375f7fe72501c42ccdad1c.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/6a8ebf1d63375f7fe72501c42ccdad1c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 1531413, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429894885, "path": "/Mahalia-jackson-silent-night-holy-night-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Mahalia-jackson-silent-night-holy-night-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/6a8ebf1d63375f7fe72501c42ccdad1c.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/6a8ebf1d63375f7fe72501c42ccdad1c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Silent Night, Holy Night", "title_with_featured": "Silent Night, Holy Night", "updated_by_human_at": 1481756357, "url": "https://genius.com/Mahalia-jackson-silent-night-holy-night-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/152498", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/87b4e0493dc12f6ae4495063ecaba7c1.1000x625x1.jpg", "id": 152498, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/542aa55d2115ff1abb923b2fbe973278.909x909x1.jpg", "index_character": "m", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Mahalia Jackson", "slug": "Mahalia-jackson", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Mahalia-jackson"}, "artist": "Mahalia Jackson", "lyrics": "Silent Night, Holy Night LyricsSilent night, holy night\nAll is calm, all is bright\nRound yon virgin, mother and child\nHoly infant so tender and mild\nSleep in heavenly peace\nSleep in heavenly peace\nSilent night, holy night\nShepherds quake at the sight\nGlories stream from heaven afar\nHeavenly hosts sing Alleluia\nChrist the savior is born\nChrist the savior is born\nSilent night, holy night\nSon of God love's pure light\nRadiant beams from thy holy face\nWith dawn of redeeming grace\nJesus Lord, at thy birth\nJesus Lord, at thy birthYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/744626", "artist_names": "Eddy Arnold", "full_title": "Does He Mean That Much To You? by\u00a0Eddy\u00a0Arnold", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/498b7850a36758044164b30bf9618e72.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/498b7850a36758044164b30bf9618e72.562x562x1.jpg", "id": 744626, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1428504024, "path": "/Eddy-arnold-does-he-mean-that-much-to-you-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Eddy-arnold-does-he-mean-that-much-to-you-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/498b7850a36758044164b30bf9618e72.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/498b7850a36758044164b30bf9618e72.562x562x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Does He Mean That Much To You?", "title_with_featured": "Does He Mean That Much To You?", "updated_by_human_at": 1428504024, "url": "https://genius.com/Eddy-arnold-does-he-mean-that-much-to-you-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/184992", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d1b02aa72c68cf0855b508601874f872.200x200x1.jpg", "id": 184992, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/498b7850a36758044164b30bf9618e72.562x562x1.jpg", "index_character": "e", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Eddy Arnold", "slug": "Eddy-arnold", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Eddy-arnold"}, "artist": "Eddy Arnold", "lyrics": "Does He Mean That Much To You?

great events of Babbitt's spring were the secret buying of real-estate options in Linton for certain street-traction officials, before the public announcement that the Linton Avenue Car Line would be extended, and a dinner which was, as he rejoiced to his wife, not only \"a regular society spread but a real sure-enough highbrow affair, with some of the keenest intellects and the brightest bunch of little women in town.\" It was so absorbing an occasion that he almost forgot his desire to run off to Maine with Paul Riesling.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though he had been born in the village of Catawba, Babbitt had risen to that metropolitan social plane on which hosts have as many as four people at dinner without planning it for more than an evening or two. But a dinner of twelve, with flowers from the florist's and all the cut-glass out, staggered even the Babbitts.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For two weeks they studied, debated, and arbitrated the list of guests.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Babbitt marveled, \"Of course we're up-to-date ourselves, but still, think of us entertaining a famous poet like Chum Frink, a fellow that on nothing but a poem or so every day and just writing a few advertisements pulls down fifteen thousand berries a year!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, and Howard Littlefield. Do you know, the other evening Eunice told me her papa speaks three languages!\" said Mrs. Babbitt.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Huh! That's nothing! So do I\u2014American, baseball, and poker!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't think it's nice to be funny about a matter like that. Think how wonderful it must be to speak three languages, and so useful and\u2014And with people like that, I don't see why we invite the Orville Joneses.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well now, Orville is a mighty up-and-coming fellow!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I know, but\u2014A laundry!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'll admit a laundry hasn't got the class of poetry or real estate, but just the same, Orvy is mighty deep. Ever start him spieling about gardening? Say, that fellow can tell you the name of every kind of tree, and some of their Greek and Latin names too! Besides, we owe the Joneses a dinner. Besides, gosh, we got to have some boob for audience, when a bunch of hot-air artists like Frink and Littlefield get going.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, dear\u2014I meant to speak of this\u2014I do think that as host you ought to sit back and listen, and let your guests have a chance to talk once in a while!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, you do, do you! Sure! I talk all the time! And I'm just a business man\u2014oh sure!\u2014I'm no Ph.D. like Littlefield, and no poet, and I haven't anything to spring! Well, let me tell you, just the other day your darn Chum Frink comes up to me at the club begging to know what I thought about the Springfield school-bond issue. And who told him? I did! You bet your life I told him! Little me! I certainly did! He came up and asked me, and I told him all about it! You bet! And he was darn glad to listen to me and\u2014Duty as a host! I guess I know my duty as a host and let me tell you\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, the Orville Joneses were invited.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0II\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the morning of the dinner, Mrs. Babbitt was restive.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, George, I want you to be sure and be home early tonight. Remember, you have to dress.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Uh-huh. I see by the Advocate that the Presbyterian General Assembly has voted to quit the Interchurch World Movement. That\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"George! Did you hear what I said? You must be home in time to dress to-night.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Dress? Hell! I'm dressed now! Think I'm going down to the office in my B.V.D.'s?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I will not have you talking indecently before the children! And you do have to put on your dinner-jacket!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I guess you mean my Tux. I tell you, of all the doggone nonsensical nuisances that was ever invented\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three minutes later, after Babbitt had wailed, \"Well, I don't know whether I'm going to dress or NOT\" in a manner which showed that he was going to dress, the discussion moved on.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, George, you mustn't forget to call in at Vecchia's on the way home and get the ice cream. Their delivery-wagon is broken down, and I don't want to trust them to send it by\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"All right! You told me that before breakfast!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I don't want you to forget. I'll be working my head off all day long, training the girl that's to help with the dinner\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"All nonsense, anyway, hiring an extra girl for the feed. Matilda could perfectly well\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"\u2014and I have to go out and buy the flowers, and fix them, and set the table, and order the salted almonds, and look at the chickens, and arrange for the children to have their supper upstairs and\u2014And I simply must depend on you to go to Vecchia's for the ice cream.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"All riiiiiight! Gosh, I'm going to get it!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"All you have to do is to go in and say you want the ice cream that Mrs. Babbitt ordered yesterday by 'phone, and it will be all ready for you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At ten-thirty she telephoned to him not to forget the ice cream from Vecchia's.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was surprised and blasted then by a thought. He wondered whether Floral Heights dinners were worth the hideous toil involved. But he repented the sacrilege in the excitement of buying the materials for cocktails.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now this was the manner of obtaining alcohol under the reign of righteousness and prohibition:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He drove from the severe rectangular streets of the modern business center into the tangled byways of Old Town\u2014jagged blocks filled with sooty warehouses and lofts; on into The Arbor, once a pleasant orchard but now a morass of lodging-houses, tenements, and brothels. Exquisite shivers chilled his spine and stomach, and he looked at every policeman with intense innocence, as one who loved the law, and admired the Force, and longed to stop and play with them. He parked his car a block from Healey Hanson's saloon, worrying, \"Well, rats, if anybody did see me, they'd think I was here on business.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He entered a place curiously like the saloons of ante-prohibition days, with a long greasy bar with sawdust in front and streaky mirror behind, a pine table at which a dirty old man dreamed over a glass of something which resembled whisky, and with two men at the bar, drinking something which resembled beer, and giving that impression of forming a large crowd which two men always give in a saloon. The bartender, a tall pale Swede with a diamond in his lilac scarf, stared at Babbitt as he stalked plumply up to the bar and whispered, \"I'd, uh\u2014Friend of Hanson's sent me here. Like to get some gin.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bartender gazed down on him in the manner of an outraged bishop. \"I guess you got the wrong place, my friend.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We sell nothing but soft drinks here.\" He cleaned the bar with a rag which would itself have done with a little cleaning, and glared across his mechanically moving elbow.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The old dreamer at the table petitioned the bartender, \"Say, Oscar, listen.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oscar did not listen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Aw, say, Oscar, listen, will yuh? Say, lis-sen!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decayed and drowsy voice of the loafer, the agreeable stink of beer-dregs, threw a spell of inanition over Babbitt. The bartender moved grimly toward the crowd of two men. Babbitt followed him as delicately as a cat, and wheedled, \"Say, Oscar, I want to speak to Mr. Hanson.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Whajuh wanta see him for?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I just want to talk to him. Here's my card.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a beautiful card, an engraved card, a card in the blackest black and the sharpest red, announcing that Mr. George F. Babbitt was Estates, Insurance, Rents. The bartender held it as though it weighed ten pounds, and read it as though it were a hundred words long. He did not bend from his episcopal dignity, but he growled, \"I'll see if he's around.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the back room he brought an immensely old young man, a quiet sharp-eyed man, in tan silk shirt, checked vest hanging open, and burning brown trousers\u2014Mr. Healey Hanson. Mr. Hanson said only \"Yuh?\" but his implacable and contemptuous eyes queried Babbitt's soul, and he seemed not at all impressed by the new dark-gray suit for which (as he had admitted to every acquaintance at the Athletic Club) Babbitt had paid a hundred and twenty-five dollars.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Glad meet you, Mr. Hanson. Say, uh\u2014I'm George Babbitt of the Babbitt-Thompson Realty Company. I'm a great friend of Jake Offutt's.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, what of it?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Say, uh, I'm going to have a party, and Jake told me you'd be able to fix me up with a little gin.\" In alarm, in obsequiousness, as Hanson's eyes grew more bored, \"You telephone to Jake about me, if you want to.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hanson answered by jerking his head to indicate the entrance to the back room, and strolled away. Babbitt melodramatically crept into an apartment containing four round tables, eleven chairs, a brewery calendar, and a smell. He waited. Thrice he saw Healey Hanson saunter through, humming, hands in pockets, ignoring him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this time Babbitt had modified his valiant morning vow, \"I won't pay one cent over seven dollars a quart\" to \"I might pay ten.\" On Hanson's next weary entrance he besought \"Could you fix that up?\" Hanson scowled, and grated, \"Just a minute\u2014Pete's sake\u2014just a min-ute!\" In growing meekness Babbitt went on waiting till Hanson casually reappeared with a quart of gin\u2014what is euphemistically known as a quart\u2014in his disdainful long white hands.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Twelve bucks,\" he snapped.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Say, uh, but say, cap'n, Jake thought you'd be able to fix me up for eight or nine a bottle.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Nup. Twelve. This is the real stuff, smuggled from Canada. This is none o' your neutral spirits with a drop of juniper extract,\" the honest merchant said virtuously. \"Twelve bones\u2014if you want it. Course y' understand I'm just doing this anyway as a friend of Jake's.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Sure! Sure! I understand!\" Babbitt gratefully held out twelve dollars. He felt honored by contact with greatness as Hanson yawned, stuffed the bills, uncounted, into his radiant vest, and swaggered away.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had a number of titillations out of concealing the gin-bottle under his coat and out of hiding it in his desk. All afternoon he snorted and chuckled and gurgled over his ability to \"give the Boys a real shot in the arm to-night.\" He was, in fact, so exhilarated that he was within a block of his house before he remembered that there was a certain matter, mentioned by his wife, of fetching ice cream from Vecchia's. He explained, \"Well, darn it\u2014\" and drove back.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vecchia was not a caterer, he was The Caterer of Zenith. Most coming-out parties were held in the white and gold ballroom of the Maison Vecchia; at all nice teas the guests recognized the five kinds of Vecchia sandwiches and the seven kinds of Vecchia cakes; and all really smart dinners ended, as on a resolving chord, in Vecchia Neapolitan ice cream in one of the three reliable molds\u2014the melon mold, the round mold like a layer cake, and the long brick.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vecchia's shop had pale blue woodwork, tracery of plaster roses, attendants in frilled aprons, and glass shelves of \"kisses\" with all the refinement that inheres in whites of eggs. Babbitt felt heavy and thick amid this professional daintiness, and as he waited for the ice cream he decided, with hot prickles at the back of his neck, that a girl customer was giggling at him. He went home in a touchy temper. The first thing he heard was his wife's agitated:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"George! DID you remember to go to Vecchia's and get the ice cream?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Say! Look here! Do I ever forget to do things?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes! Often!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well now, it's darn seldom I do, and it certainly makes me tired, after going into a pink-tea joint like Vecchia's and having to stand around looking at a lot of half-naked young girls, all rouged up like they were sixty and eating a lot of stuff that simply ruins their stomachs\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, it's too bad about you! I've noticed how you hate to look at pretty girls!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a jar Babbitt realized that his wife was too busy to be impressed by that moral indignation with which males rule the world, and he went humbly up-stairs to dress. He had an impression of a glorified dining-room, of cut-glass, candles, polished wood, lace, silver, roses. With the awed swelling of the heart suitable to so grave a business as giving a dinner, he slew the temptation to wear his plaited dress-shirt for a fourth time, took out an entirely fresh one, tightened his black bow, and rubbed his patent-leather pumps with a handkerchief. He glanced with pleasure at his garnet and silver studs. He smoothed and patted his ankles, transformed by silk socks from the sturdy shanks of George Babbitt to the elegant limbs of what is called a Clubman. He stood before the pier-glass, viewing his trim dinner-coat, his beautiful triple-braided trousers; and murmured in lyric beatitude, \"By golly, I don't look so bad. I certainly don't look like Catawba. If the hicks back home could see me in this rig, they'd have a fit!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He moved majestically down to mix the cocktails. As he chipped ice, as he squeezed oranges, as he collected vast stores of bottles, glasses, and spoons at the sink in the pantry, he felt as authoritative as the bartender at Healey Hanson's saloon. True, Mrs. Babbitt said he was under foot, and Matilda and the maid hired for the evening brushed by him, elbowed him, shrieked \"Pleasopn door,\" as they tottered through with trays, but in this high moment he ignored them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides the new bottle of gin, his cellar consisted of one half-bottle of Bourbon whisky, a quarter of a bottle of Italian vermouth, and approximately one hundred drops of orange bitters. He did not possess a cocktail-shaker. A shaker was proof of dissipation, the symbol of a Drinker, and Babbitt disliked being known as a Drinker even more than he liked a Drink. He mixed by pouring from an ancient gravy-boat into a handleless pitcher; he poured with a noble dignity, holding his alembics high beneath the powerful Mazda globe, his face hot, his shirt-front a glaring white, the copper sink a scoured red-gold.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He tasted the sacred essence. \"Now, by golly, if that isn't pretty near one fine old cocktail! Kind of a Bronx, and yet like a Manhattan. Ummmmmm! Hey, Myra, want a little nip before the folks come?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bustling into the dining-room, moving each glass a quarter of an inch, rushing back with resolution implacable on her face her gray and silver-lace party frock protected by a denim towel, Mrs. Babbitt glared at him, and rebuked him, \"Certainly not!\"\n\"Well,\" in a loose, jocose manner, \"I think the old man will!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cocktail filled him with a whirling exhilaration behind which he was aware of devastating desires\u2014to rush places in fast motors, to kiss girls, to sing, to be witty. He sought to regain his lost dignity by announcing to Matilda:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm going to stick this pitcher of cocktails in the refrigerator. Be sure you don't upset any of 'em.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeh.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, be sure now. Don't go putting anything on this top shelf.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeh.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, be\u2014\" He was dizzy. His voice was thin and distant. \"Whee!\" With enormous impressiveness he commanded, \"Well, be sure now,\" and minced into the safety of the living-room. He wondered whether he could persuade \"as slow a bunch as Myra and the Littlefields to go some place aft' dinner and raise Cain and maybe dig up smore booze.\" He perceived that he had gifts of profligacy which had been neglected.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the time the guests had come, including the inevitable late couple for whom the others waited with painful amiability, a great gray emptiness had replaced the purple swirling in Babbitt's head, and he had to force the tumultuous greetings suitable to a host on Floral Heights.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The guests were Howard Littlefield, the doctor of philosophy who furnished publicity and comforting economics to the Street Traction Company; Vergil Gunch, the coal-dealer, equally powerful in the Elks and in the Boosters' Club; Eddie Swanson the agent for the Javelin Motor Car, who lived across the street; and Orville Jones, owner of the Lily White Laundry, which justly announced itself \"the biggest, busiest, bulliest cleanerie shoppe in Zenith.\" But, naturally, the most distinguished of all was T. Cholmondeley Frink, who was not only the author of \"Poemulations,\" which, syndicated daily in sixty-seven leading newspapers, gave him one of the largest audiences of any poet in the world, but also an optimistic lecturer and the creator of \"Ads that Add.\" Despite the searching philosophy and high morality of his verses, they were humorous and easily understood by any child of twelve; and it added a neat air of pleasantry to them that they were set not as verse but as prose. Mr. Frink was known from Coast to Coast as \"Chum.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With them were six wives, more or less\u2014it was hard to tell, so early in the evening, as at first glance they all looked alike, and as they all said, \"Oh, ISN'T this nice!\" in the same tone of determined liveliness. To the eye, the men were less similar: Littlefield, a hedge-scholar, tall and horse-faced; Chum Frink, a trifle of a man with soft and mouse-like hair, advertising his profession as poet by a silk cord on his eye-glasses; Vergil Gunch, broad, with coarse black hair en brosse; Eddie Swanson, a bald and bouncing young man who showed his taste for elegance by an evening waistcoat of figured black silk with glass buttons; Orville Jones, a steady-looking, stubby, not very memorable person, with a hemp-colored toothbrush mustache. Yet they were all so well fed and clean, they all shouted \"'Evenin', Georgie!\" with such robustness, that they seemed to be cousins, and the strange thing is that the longer one knew the women, the less alike they seemed; while the longer one knew the men, the more alike their bold patterns appeared.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The drinking of the cocktails was as canonical a rite as the mixing. The company waited, uneasily, hopefully, agreeing in a strained manner that the weather had been rather warm and slightly cold, but still Babbitt said nothing about drinks. They became despondent. But when the late couple (the Swansons) had arrived, Babbitt hinted, \"Well, folks, do you think you could stand breaking the law a little?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They looked at Chum Frink, the recognized lord of language. Frink pulled at his eye-glass cord as at a bell-rope, he cleared his throat and said that which was the custom:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'll tell you, George: I'm a law-abiding man, but they do say Verg Gunch is a regular yegg, and of course he's bigger 'n I am, and I just can't figure out what I'd do if he tried to force me into anything criminal!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gunch was roaring, \"Well, I'll take a chance\u2014\" when Frink held up his hand and went on, \"So if Verg and you insist, Georgie, I'll park my car on the wrong side of the street, because I take it for granted that's the crime you're hinting at!\"\nThere was a great deal of laughter. Mrs. Jones asserted, \"Mr. Frink is simply too killing! You'd think he was so innocent!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Babbitt clamored, \"How did you guess it, Chum? Well, you-all just wait a moment while I go out and get the\u2014keys to your cars!\" Through a froth of merriment he brought the shining promise, the mighty tray of glasses with the cloudy yellow cocktails in the glass pitcher in the center. The men babbled, \"Oh, gosh, have a look!\" and \"This gets me right where I live!\" and \"Let me at it!\" But Chum Frink, a traveled man and not unused to woes, was stricken by the thought that the potion might be merely fruit-juice with a little neutral spirits. He looked timorous as Babbitt, a moist and ecstatic almoner, held out a glass, but as he tasted it he piped, \"Oh, man, let me dream on! It ain't true, but don't waken me! Jus' lemme slumber!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two hours before, Frink had completed a newspaper lyric beginning:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I sat alone and groused and thunk, and scratched my head and sighed and wunk, and groaned, There still are boobs, alack, who'd like the old-time gin-mill back; that den that makes a sage a loon, the vile and smelly old saloon! I'll never miss their poison booze, whilst I the bubbling spring can use, that leaves my head at merry morn as clear as any babe new-born!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Babbitt drank with the others; his moment's depression was gone; he perceived that these were the best fellows in the world; he wanted to give them a thousand cocktails. \"Think you could stand another?\" he cried. The wives refused, with giggles, but the men, speaking in a wide, elaborate, enjoyable manner, gloated, \"Well, sooner than have you get sore at me, Georgie\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You got a little dividend coming,\" said Babbitt to each of them, and each intoned, \"Squeeze it, Georgie, squeeze it!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, beyond hope, the pitcher was empty, they stood and talked about prohibition. The men leaned back on their heels, put their hands in their trousers-pockets, and proclaimed their views with the booming profundity of a prosperous male repeating a thoroughly hackneyed statement about a matter of which he knows nothing whatever.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, I'll tell you,\" said Vergil Gunch; \"way I figure it is this, and I can speak by the book, because I've talked to a lot of doctors and fellows that ought to know, and the way I see it is that it's a good thing to get rid of the saloon, but they ought to let a fellow have beer and light wines.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Howard Littlefield observed, \"What isn't generally realized is that it's a dangerous prop'sition to invade the rights of personal liberty. Now, take this for instance: The King of\u2014Bavaria? I think it was Bavaria\u2014yes, Bavaria, it was\u2014in 1862, March, 1862, he issued a proclamation against public grazing of live-stock. The peasantry had stood for overtaxation without the slightest complaint, but when this proclamation came out, they rebelled. Or it may have been Saxony. But it just goes to show the dangers of invading the rights of personal liberty.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That's it\u2014no one got a right to invade personal liberty,\" said Orville Jones.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just the same, you don't want to forget prohibition is a mighty good thing for the working-classes. Keeps 'em from wasting their money and lowering their productiveness,\" said Vergil Gunch.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, that's so. But the trouble is the manner of enforcement,\" insisted Howard Littlefield. \"Congress didn't understand the right system. Now, if I'd been running the thing, I'd have arranged it so that the drinker himself was licensed, and then we could have taken care of the shiftless workman\u2014kept him from drinking\u2014and yet not 've interfered with the rights\u2014with the personal liberty\u2014of fellows like ourselves.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They bobbed their heads, looked admiringly at one another, and stated, \"That's so, that would be the stunt.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The thing that worries me is that a lot of these guys will take to cocaine,\" sighed Eddie Swanson.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They bobbed more violently, and groaned, \"That's so, there is a danger of that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chum Frink chanted, \"Oh, say, I got hold of a swell new receipt for home-made beer the other day. You take\u2014\"\nGunch interrupted, \"Wait! Let me tell you mine!\" Littlefield snorted, \"Beer! Rats! Thing to do is to ferment cider!\" Jones insisted, \"I've got the receipt that does the business!\" Swanson begged, \"Oh, say, lemme tell you the story\u2014\" But Frink went on resolutely, \"You take and save the shells from peas, and pour six gallons of water on a bushel of shells and boil the mixture till\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Babbitt turned toward them with yearning sweetness; Frink hastened to finish even his best beer-recipe; and she said gaily, \"Dinner is served.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a good deal of friendly argument among the men as to which should go in last, and while they were crossing the hall from the living-room to the dining-room Vergil Gunch made them laugh by thundering, \"If I can't sit next to Myra Babbitt and hold her hand under the table, I won't play\u2014I'm goin' home.\" In the dining-room they stood embarrassed while Mrs. Babbitt fluttered, \"Now, let me see\u2014Oh, I was going to have some nice hand-painted place-cards for you but\u2014Oh, let me see; Mr. Frink, you sit there.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dinner was in the best style of women's-magazine art, whereby the salad was served in hollowed apples, and everything but the invincible fried chicken resembled something else. Ordinarily the men found it hard to talk to the women; flirtation was an art unknown on Floral Heights, and the realms of offices and of kitchens had no alliances. But under the inspiration of the cocktails, conversation was violent. Each of the men still had a number of important things to say about prohibition, and now that each had a loyal listener in his dinner-partner he burst out:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I found a place where I can get all the hootch I want at eight a quart\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you read about this fellow that went and paid a thousand dollars for ten cases of red-eye that proved to be nothing but water? Seems this fellow was standing on the corner and fellow comes up to him\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They say there's a whole raft of stuff being smuggled across at Detroit\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What I always say is\u2014what a lot of folks don't realize about prohibition\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And then you get all this awful poison stuff\u2014wood alcohol and everything\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Course I believe in it on principle, but I don't propose to have anybody telling me what I got to think and do. No American 'll ever stand for that!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But they all felt that it was rather in bad taste for Orville Jones\u2014and he not recognized as one of the wits of the occasion anyway\u2014to say, \"In fact, the whole thing about prohibition is this: it isn't the initial cost, it's the humidity.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not till the one required topic had been dealt with did the conversation become general.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was often and admiringly said of Vergil Gunch, \"Gee, that fellow can get away with murder! Why, he can pull a Raw One in mixed company and all the ladies 'll laugh their heads off, but me, gosh, if I crack anything that's just the least bit off color I get the razz for fair!\" Now Gunch delighted them by crying to Mrs. Eddie Swanson, youngest of the women, \"Louetta! I managed to pinch Eddie's doorkey out of his pocket, and what say you and me sneak across the street when the folks aren't looking? Got something,\" with a gorgeous leer, \"awful important to tell you!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The women wriggled, and Babbitt was stirred to like naughtiness. \"Say, folks, I wished I dared show you a book I borrowed from Doc Patten!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, George! The idea!\" Mrs. Babbitt warned him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This book\u2014racy isn't the word! It's some kind of an anthropological report about\u2014about Customs, in the South Seas, and what it doesn't SAY! It's a book you can't buy. Verg, I'll lend it to you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Me first!\" insisted Eddie Swanson. \"Sounds spicy!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Orville Jones announced, \"Say, I heard a Good One the other day about a coupla Swedes and their wives,\" and, in the best Jewish accent, he resolutely carried the Good One to a slightly disinfected ending. Gunch capped it. But the cocktails waned, the seekers dropped back into cautious reality.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chum Frink had recently been on a lecture-tour among the small towns, and he chuckled, \"Awful good to get back to civilization! I certainly been seeing some hick towns! I mean\u2014Course the folks there are the best on earth, but, gee whiz, those Main Street burgs are slow, and you fellows can't hardly appreciate what it means to be here with a bunch of live ones!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You bet!\" exulted Orville Jones. \"They're the best folks on earth, those small-town folks, but, oh, mama! what conversation! Why, say, they can't talk about anything but the weather and the ne-oo Ford, by heckalorum!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That's right. They all talk about just the same things,\" said Eddie Swanson.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't they, though! They just say the same things over and over,\" said Vergil Gunch.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, it's really remarkable. They seem to lack all power of looking at things impersonally. They simply go over and over the same talk about Fords and the weather and so on.\" said Howard Littlefield.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Still, at that, you can't blame 'em. They haven't got any intellectual stimulus such as you get up here in the city,\" said Chum Frink.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Gosh, that's right,\" said Babbitt. \"I don't want you highbrows to get stuck on yourselves but I must say it keeps a fellow right up on his toes to sit in with a poet and with Howard, the guy that put the con in economics! But these small-town boobs, with nobody but each other to talk to, no wonder they get so sloppy and uncultured in their speech, and so balled-up in their thinking!\"\nOrville Jones commented, \"And, then take our other advantages\u2014the movies, frinstance. These Yapville sports think they're all-get-out if they have one change of bill a week, where here in the city you got your choice of a dozen diff'rent movies any evening you want to name!\"\n\"Sure, and the inspiration we get from rubbing up against high-class hustlers every day and getting jam full of ginger,\" said Eddie Swanson.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Same time,\" said Babbitt, \"no sense excusing these rube burgs too easy. Fellow's own fault if he doesn't show the initiative to up and beat it to the city, like we done\u2014did. And, just speaking in confidence among friends, they're jealous as the devil of a city man. Every time I go up to Catawba I have to go around apologizing to the fellows I was brought up with because I've more or less succeeded and they haven't. And if you talk natural to 'em, way we do here, and show finesse and what you might call a broad point of view, why, they think you're putting on side. There's my own half-brother Martin\u2014runs the little ole general store my Dad used to keep. Say, I'll bet he don't know there is such a thing as a Tux\u2014as a dinner-jacket. If he was to come in here now, he'd think we were a bunch of\u2014of\u2014Why, gosh, I swear, he wouldn't know what to think! Yes, sir, they're jealous!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chum Frink agreed, \"That's so. But what I mind is their lack of culture and appreciation of the Beautiful\u2014if you'll excuse me for being highbrow. Now, I like to give a high-class lecture, and read some of my best poetry\u2014not the newspaper stuff but the magazine things. But say, when I get out in the tall grass, there's nothing will take but a lot of cheesy old stories and slang and junk that if any of us were to indulge in it here, he'd get the gate so fast it would make his head swim.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vergil Gunch summed it up: \"Fact is, we're mighty lucky to be living among a bunch of city-folks, that recognize artistic things and business-punch equally. We'd feel pretty glum if we got stuck in some Main Street burg and tried to wise up the old codgers to the kind of life we're used to here. But, by golly, there's this you got to say for 'em: Every small American town is trying to get population and modern ideals. And darn if a lot of 'em don't put it across! Somebody starts panning a rube crossroads, telling how he was there in 1900 and it consisted of one muddy street, count 'em, one, and nine hundred human clams. Well, you go back there in 1920, and you find pavements and a swell little hotel and a first-class ladies' ready-to-wear shop-real perfection, in fact! You don't want to just look at what these small towns are, you want to look at what they're aiming to become, and they all got an ambition that in the long run is going to make 'em the finest spots on earth\u2014they all want to be just like Zenith!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0III\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However intimate they might be with T. Cholmondeley Frink as a neighbor, as a borrower of lawn-mowers and monkey-wrenches, they knew that he was also a Famous Poet and a distinguished advertising-agent; that behind his easiness were sultry literary mysteries which they could not penetrate. But to-night, in the gin-evolved confidence, he admitted them to the arcanum:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I've got a literary problem that's worrying me to death. I'm doing a series of ads for the Zeeco Car and I want to make each of 'em a real little gem\u2014reg'lar stylistic stuff. I'm all for this theory that perfection is the stunt, or nothing at all, and these are as tough things as I ever tackled. You might think it'd be harder to do my poems\u2014all these Heart Topics: home and fireside and happiness\u2014but they're cinches. You can't go wrong on 'em; you know what sentiments any decent go-ahead fellow must have if he plays the game, and you stick right to 'em. But the poetry of industrialism, now there's a literary line where you got to open up new territory. Do you know the fellow who's really THE American genius? The fellow who you don't know his name and I don't either, but his work ought to be preserved so's future generations can judge our American thought and originality to-day? Why, the fellow that writes the Prince Albert Tobacco ads! Just listen to this:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's P.A. that jams such joy in jimmy pipes. Say\u2014bet you've often bent-an-ear to that spill-of-speech about hopping from five to f-i-f-t-y p-e-r by \"stepping on her a bit!\" Guess that's going some, all right\u2014BUT just among ourselves, you better start a rapidwhiz system to keep tabs as to how fast you'll buzz from low smoke spirits to TIP-TOP-HIGH\u2014once you line up behind a jimmy pipe that's all aglow with that peach-of-a-pal, Prince Albert.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prince Albert is john-on-the-job\u2014always joy'usly more-ISH in flavor; always delightfully cool and fragrant! For a fact, you never hooked such double-decked, copper-riveted, two-fisted smoke enjoyment!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Go to a pipe\u2014speed-o-quick like you light on a good thing! Why\u2014packed with Prince Albert you can play a joy'us jimmy straight across the boards! AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now that,\" caroled the motor agent, Eddie Swanson, \"that's what I call he-literature! That Prince Albert fellow\u2014though, gosh, there can't be just one fellow that writes 'em; must be a big board of classy ink-slingers in conference, but anyway: now, him, he doesn't write for long-haired pikers, he writes for Regular Guys, he writes for ME, and I tip my benny to him! The only thing is: I wonder if it sells the goods? Course, like all these poets, this Prince Albert fellow lets his idea run away with him. It makes elegant reading, but it don't say nothing. I'd never go out and buy Prince Albert Tobacco after reading it, because it doesn't tell me anything about the stuff. It's just a bunch of fluff.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frink faced him: \"Oh, you're crazy! Have I got to sell you the idea of Style? Anyway that's the kind of stuff I'd like to do for the Zeeco. But I simply can't. So I decided to stick to the straight poetic, and I took a shot at a highbrow ad for the Zeeco. How do you like this:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The long white trail is calling\u2014calling-and it's over the hills and far away for every man or woman that has red blood in his veins and on his lips the ancient song of the buccaneers. It's away with dull drudging, and a fig for care. Speed\u2014glorious Speed\u2014it's more than just a moment's exhilaration\u2014it's Life for you and me! This great new truth the makers of the Zeeco Car have considered as much as price and style. It's fleet as the antelope, smooth as the glide of a swallow, yet powerful as the charge of a bull-elephant. Class breathes in every line. Listen, brother! You'll never know what the high art of hiking is till you TRY LIFE'S ZIPPINGEST ZEST\u2014THE ZEECO!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes,\" Frink mused, \"that's got an elegant color to it, if I do say so, but it ain't got the originality of 'spill-of-speech!'\" The whole company sighed with sympathy and admiration.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1732772", "artist_names": "Johnny Tillotson", "full_title": "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry by\u00a0Johnny\u00a0Tillotson", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/0177411f06357310912eac26415fdccf.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0177411f06357310912eac26415fdccf.620x620x1.jpg", "id": 1732772, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429906463, "path": "/Johnny-tillotson-im-so-lonesome-i-could-cry-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Johnny-tillotson-im-so-lonesome-i-could-cry-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1962, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1962", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1962", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/0177411f06357310912eac26415fdccf.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0177411f06357310912eac26415fdccf.620x620x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "I\u2019m So Lonesome I Could Cry", "title_with_featured": "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry", "updated_by_human_at": 1556732245, "url": "https://genius.com/Johnny-tillotson-im-so-lonesome-i-could-cry-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/360686", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/40db99b5eeccc5ac09e80ec45c6615ed.1000x748x1.jpg", "id": 360686, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2d37ba86b8f3b740412fb9c377be3fb3.300x300x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Johnny Tillotson", "slug": "Johnny-tillotson", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Johnny-tillotson"}, "artist": "Johnny Tillotson", "lyrics": "I\u2019m So Lonesome I Could Cry LyricsHear that lonesome whippoorwill\nHe sounds too blue to fly\nThe midnight train is whining low\nI'm so lonesome I could cry\n\nI've never seen a night so long\nWhen time goes crawling by\nThe moon just went behind the clouds\nTo hide its face and cry\n\nDid you ever see a robin weep\nWhen leaves begin to die\nThat mean's he's lost his will to live\nI'm so lonesome I could cry\nThe silence of a falling star\nLights up a purple sky\nAnd as I wonder where you are\nI'm so lonesome I could cryYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 228, "api_path": "/songs/2496032", "artist_names": "Country Genius", "full_title": "Folk Songs From Around the World by\u00a0Country\u00a0Genius", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/d08b4dfbf5f26f55853ab66a722b4a3d.300x84x1.gif", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d08b4dfbf5f26f55853ab66a722b4a3d.305x85x1.gif", "id": 2496032, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1217557, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1560198502, "path": "/Country-genius-folk-songs-from-around-the-world-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Country-genius-folk-songs-from-around-the-world-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 20}, "release_date_for_display": "June 20, 2016", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jun. 20, 2016", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/f11401016c99c3272bcdedaee7d68174.300x209x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f11401016c99c3272bcdedaee7d68174.384x268x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 5600}, "title": "Folk Songs From Around the World", "title_with_featured": "Folk Songs From Around the World", "updated_by_human_at": 1560198503, "url": "https://genius.com/Country-genius-folk-songs-from-around-the-world-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/214055", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/203e2cc1a4dc29cbd97e5c7e3aeced47.1000x563x1.jpg", "id": 214055, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ba89ed3a929e3e3c527598501a230e84.542x374x1.jpg", "index_character": "c", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Country Genius", "slug": "Country-genius", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Country-genius"}, "artist": "Country Genius", "lyrics": "Folk Songs From Around the World LyricsIn alphabetical order by title:\n\n(Can't find your song?

Or buy your coach.\u201d\n\nVaccaro\u2019s audience, the members of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, bristled. These were eminent reformers\u2014among them the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, two former heads of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and several university presidents and chancellors. The Knight Foundation, a nonprofit that takes an interest in college athletics as part of its concern with civic life, had tasked them with saving college sports from runaway commercialism as embodied by the likes of Vaccaro, who, since signing his pioneering shoe contract with Michael Jordan in 1984, had built sponsorship empires successively at Nike, Adidas, and Reebok. Not all the members could hide their scorn for the \u201csneaker pimp\u201d of schoolyard hustle, who boasted of writing checks for millions to everybody in higher education.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d asked Bryce Jordan, the president emeritus of Penn State, \u201cshould a university be an advertising medium for your industry?\u201d\n\nVaccaro did not blink. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t, sir,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou sold your souls, and you\u2019re going to continue selling them. You can be very moral and righteous in asking me that question, sir,\u201d Vaccaro added with irrepressible good cheer, \u201cbut there\u2019s not one of you in this room that\u2019s going to turn down any of our money. You\u2019re going to take it. I can only offer it.\u201d\n\nWilliam Friday, a former president of North Carolina\u2019s university system, still winces at the memory. \u201cBoy, the silence that fell in that room,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cI never will forget it.\u201d Friday, who founded and co-chaired two of the three Knight Foundation sports initiatives over the past 20 years, called Vaccaro \u201cthe worst of all\u201d the witnesses ever to come before the panel.\n\nBut what Vaccaro said in 2001 was true then, and it\u2019s true now: corporations offer money so they can profit from the glory of college athletes, and the universities grab it. In 2010, despite the faltering economy, a single college athletic league, the football-crazed Southeastern Conference (SEC), became the first to crack the billion-dollar barrier in athletic receipts. The Big Ten pursued closely at $905 million. That money comes from a combination of ticket sales, concession sales, merchandise, licensing fees, and other sources\u2014but the great bulk of it comes from television contracts.\nEducators are in thrall to their athletic departments because of these television riches and because they respect the political furies that can burst from a locker room. \u201cThere\u2019s fear,\u201d Friday told me when I visited him on the University of North Carolina campus in Chapel Hill last fall. As we spoke, two giant construction cranes towered nearby over the university\u2019s Kenan Stadium, working on the latest $77 million renovation. (The University of Michigan spent almost four times that much to expand its Big House.) Friday insisted that for the networks, paying huge sums to universities was a bargain. \u201cWe do every little thing for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe furnish the theater, the actors, the lights, the music, and the audience for a drama measured neatly in time slots. They bring the camera and turn it on.\u201d Friday, a weathered idealist at 91, laments the control universities have ceded in pursuit of this money. If television wants to broadcast football from here on a Thursday night, he said, \u201cwe shut down the university at 3 o\u2019clock to accommodate the crowds.\u201d He longed for a campus identity more centered in an academic mission.\n\nThe United States is the only country in the world that hosts big-time sports at institutions of higher learning. This should not, in and of itself, be controversial. College athletics are rooted in the classical ideal of mens sane in corpore sano\u2014a sound mind in a sound body\u2014and who would argue with that? College sports are deeply inscribed in the culture of our nation. Half a million young men and women play competitive intercollegiate sports each year. Millions of spectators flock into football stadiums each Saturday in the fall, and tens of millions more watch on television. The March Madness basketball tournament each spring has become a major national event, with upwards of 80 million watching it on television and talking about the games around the office water cooler. ESPN has spawned ESPNU, a channel dedicated to college sports, and Fox Sports and other cable outlets are developing channels exclusively to cover sports from specific regions or divisions.\nWith so many people paying for tickets and watching on television, college sports has become Very Big Business. According to various reports, the football teams at Texas, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, and Penn State\u2014to name just a few big-revenue football schools\u2014each earn between $40 million and $80 million in profits a year, even after paying coaches multimillion-dollar salaries. When you combine so much money with such high, almost tribal, stakes\u2014football boosters are famously rabid in their zeal to have their alma mater win\u2014corruption is likely to follow.\n\nScandal after scandal has rocked college sports. In 2010, the NCAA sanctioned the University of Southern California after determining that star running back Reggie Bush and his family had received \u201cimproper benefits\u201d while he played for the Trojans. (Among other charges, Bush and members of his family were alleged to have received free airfare and limousine rides, a car, and a rent-free home in San Diego, from sports agents who wanted Bush as a client.) The Bowl Championship Series stripped USC of its 2004 national title, and Bush returned the Heisman Trophy he had won in 2005. Last fall, as Auburn University football stormed its way to an undefeated season and a national championship, the team\u2019s star quarterback, Cam Newton, was dogged by allegations that his father had used a recruiter to solicit up to $180,000 from Mississippi State in exchange for his son\u2019s matriculation there after junior college in 2010. Jim Tressel, the highly successful head football coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes, resigned last spring after the NCAA alleged he had feigned ignorance of rules violations by players on his team. At least 28 players over the course of the previous nine seasons, according to Sports Illustrated, had traded autographs, jerseys, and other team memorabilia in exchange for tattoos or cash at a tattoo parlor in Columbus, in violation of NCAA rules. Late this summer, Yahoo Sports reported that the NCAA was investigating allegations that a University of Miami booster had given millions of dollars in illicit cash and services to more than 70 Hurricanes football players over eight years.\n\nThe list of scandals goes on. With each revelation, there is much wringing of hands. Critics scold schools for breaking faith with their educational mission, and for failing to enforce the sanctity of \u201camateurism.\u201d Sportswriters denounce the NCAA for both tyranny and impotence in its quest to \u201cclean up\u201d college sports. Observers on all sides express jumbled emotions about youth and innocence, venting against professional mores or greedy amateurs.\nFor all the outrage, the real scandal is not that students are getting illegally paid or recruited, it\u2019s that two of the noble principles on which the NCAA justifies its existence\u2014\u201camateurism\u201d and the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d\u2014are cynical hoaxes, legalistic confections propagated by the universities so they can exploit the skills and fame of young athletes. The tragedy at the heart of college sports is not that some college athletes are getting paid, but that more of them are not.\n\n\nDon Curtis, a UNC trustee, told me that impoverished football players cannot afford movie tickets or bus fare home. Curtis is a rarity among those in higher education today, in that he dares to violate the signal taboo: \u201cI think we should pay these guys something.\u201d\nFans and educators alike recoil from this proposal as though from original sin. Amateurism is the whole point, they say. Paid athletes would destroy the integrity and appeal of college sports. Many former college athletes object that money would have spoiled the sanctity of the bond they enjoyed with their teammates. I, too, once shuddered instinctively at the notion of paid college athletes.\n\nBut after an inquiry that took me into locker rooms and ivory towers across the country, I have come to believe that sentiment blinds us to what\u2019s before our eyes. Big-time college sports are fully commercialized. Billions of dollars flow through them each year. The NCAA makes money, and enables universities and corporations to make money, from the unpaid labor of young athletes.\nSlavery analogies should be used carefully. College athletes are not slaves. Yet to survey the scene\u2014corporations and universities enriching themselves on the backs of uncompensated young men, whose status as \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d deprives them of the right to due process guaranteed by the Constitution\u2014is to catch an unmistakable whiff of the plantation. Perhaps a more apt metaphor is colonialism: college sports, as overseen by the NCAA, is a system imposed by well-meaning paternalists and rationalized with hoary sentiments about caring for the well-being of the colonized. But it is, nonetheless, unjust. The NCAA, in its zealous defense of bogus principles, sometimes destroys the dreams of innocent young athletes.\n\nThe NCAA today is in many ways a classic cartel. Efforts to reform it\u2014most notably by the three Knight Commissions over the course of 20 years\u2014have, while making changes around the edges, been largely fruitless. The time has come for a major overhaul. And whether the powers that be like it or not, big changes are coming. Threats loom on multiple fronts: in Congress, the courts, breakaway athletic conferences, student rebellion, and public disgust. Swaddled in gauzy clich\u00e9s, the NCAA presides over a vast, teetering glory.\nFounding Myths\nFrom the start, amateurism in college sports has been honored more often in principle than in fact; the NCAA was built of a mixture of noble and venal impulses. In the late 19th century, intellectuals believed that the sporting arena simulated an impending age of Darwinian struggle. Because the United States did not hold a global empire like England\u2019s, leaders warned of national softness once railroads conquered the last continental frontier. As though heeding this warning, ingenious students turned variations on rugby into a toughening agent. Today a plaque in New Brunswick, New Jersey, commemorates the first college game, on November 6, 1869, when Rutgers beat Princeton 6\u20134.\nWalter Camp graduated from Yale in 1880 so intoxicated by the sport that he devoted his life to it without pay, becoming \u201cthe father of American football.\u201d He persuaded other schools to reduce the chaos on the field by trimming each side from 15 players to 11, and it was his idea to paint measuring lines on the field. He conceived functional designations for players, coining terms such as quarterback. His game remained violent by design. Crawlers could push the ball forward beneath piles of flying elbows without pause until they cried \u201cDown!\u201d in submission.\n\nIn an 1892 game against its archrival, Yale, the Harvard football team was the first to deploy a \u201cflying wedge,\u201d based on Napoleon\u2019s surprise concentrations of military force. In an editorial calling for the abolition of the play, The New York Times described it as \u201chalf a ton of bone and muscle coming into collision with a man weighing 160 or 170 pounds,\u201d noting that surgeons often had to be called onto the field. Three years later, the continuing mayhem prompted the Harvard faculty to take the first of two votes to abolish football. Charles Eliot, the university\u2019s president, brought up other concerns. \u201cDeaths and injuries are not the strongest argument against football,\u201d declared Eliot. \u201cThat cheating and brutality are profitable is the main evil.\u201d Still, Harvard football persisted. In 1903, fervent alumni built Harvard Stadium with zero college funds. The team\u2019s first paid head coach, Bill Reid, started in 1905 at nearly twice the average salary for a full professor.\n\nA newspaper story from that year, illustrated with the Grim Reaper laughing on a goalpost, counted 25 college players killed during football season. A fairy-tale version of the founding of the NCAA holds that President Theodore Roosevelt, upset by a photograph of a bloodied Swarthmore College player, vowed to civilize or destroy football. The real story is that Roosevelt maneuvered shrewdly to preserve the sport\u2014and give a boost to his beloved Harvard. After McClure\u2019s magazine published a story on corrupt teams with phantom students, a muckraker exposed Walter Camp\u2019s $100,000 slush fund at Yale. In response to mounting outrage, Roosevelt summoned leaders from Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to the White House, where Camp parried mounting criticism and conceded nothing irresponsible in the college football rules he\u2019d established. At Roosevelt\u2019s behest, the three schools issued a public statement that college sports must reform to survive, and representatives from 68 colleges founded a new organization that would soon be called the National Collegiate Athletic Association. A Haverford College official was confirmed as secretary but then promptly resigned in favor of Bill Reid, the new Harvard coach, who instituted new rules that benefited Harvard\u2019s playing style at the expense of Yale\u2019s. At a stroke, Roosevelt saved football and dethroned Yale.\n\nFor nearly 50 years, the NCAA, with no real authority and no staff to speak of, enshrined amateur ideals that it was helpless to enforce. (Not until 1939 did it gain the power even to mandate helmets.) In 1929, the Carnegie Foundation made headlines with a report, \u201cAmerican College Athletics,\u201d which concluded that the scramble for players had \u201creached the proportions of nationwide commerce.\u201d Of the 112 schools surveyed, 81 flouted NCAA recommendations with inducements to students ranging from open payrolls and disguised booster funds to no-show jobs at movie studios. Fans ignored the uproar, and two-thirds of the colleges mentioned told The New York Times that they planned no changes. In 1939, freshman players at the University of Pittsburgh went on strike because they were getting paid less than their upperclassman teammates.\n\nEmbarrassed, the NCAA in 1948 enacted a \u201cSanity Code,\u201d which was supposed to prohibit all concealed and indirect benefits for college athletes; any money for athletes was to be limited to transparent scholarships awarded solely on financial need. Schools that violated this code would be expelled from NCAA membership and thus exiled from competitive sports.\n\nThis bold effort flopped. Colleges balked at imposing such a drastic penalty on each other, and the Sanity Code was repealed within a few years. The University of Virginia went so far as to call a press conference to say that if its athletes were ever accused of being paid, they should be forgiven, because their studies at Thomas Jefferson\u2019s university were so rigorous.\n\nThe Big Bluff\nIn 1951, the NCAA seized upon a serendipitous set of events to gain control of intercollegiate sports. First, the organization hired a young college dropout named Walter Byers as executive director. A journalist who was not yet 30 years old, he was an appropriately inauspicious choice for the vaguely defined new post. He wore cowboy boots and a toupee. He shunned personal contact, obsessed over details, and proved himself a bureaucratic master of pervasive, anonymous intimidation. Although discharged from the Army during World War II for defective vision, Byers was able to see an opportunity in two contemporaneous scandals. In one, the tiny College of William and Mary, aspiring to challenge football powers Oklahoma and Ohio State, was found to be counterfeiting grades to keep conspicuously pampered players eligible. In the other, a basketball point-shaving conspiracy (in which gamblers paid players to perform poorly) had spread from five New York colleges to the University of Kentucky, the reigning national champion, generating tabloid \u201cperp\u201d photos of gangsters and handcuffed basketball players. The scandals posed a crisis of credibility for collegiate athletics, and nothing in the NCAA\u2019s feeble record would have led anyone to expect real reform.\n\nBut Byers managed to impanel a small infractions board to set penalties without waiting for a full convention of NCAA schools, which would have been inclined toward forgiveness. Then he lobbied a University of Kentucky dean\u2014A. D. Kirwan, a former football coach and future university president\u2014not to contest the NCAA\u2019s dubious legal position (the association had no actual authority to penalize the university), pleading that college sports must do something to restore public support. His gambit succeeded when Kirwan reluctantly accepted a landmark precedent: the Kentucky basketball team would be suspended for the entire 1952\u201353 season. Its legendary coach, Adolph Rupp, fumed for a year in limbo.\n\nThe Kentucky case created an aura of centralized command for an NCAA office that barely existed. At the same time, a colossal misperception gave Byers leverage to mine gold. Amazingly in retrospect, most colleges and marketing experts considered the advent of television a dire threat to sports. Studies found that broadcasts reduced live attendance, and therefore gate receipts, because some customers preferred to watch at home for free. Nobody could yet imagine the revenue bonanza that television represented. With clunky new TV sets proliferating, the 1951 NCAA convention voted 161\u20137 to outlaw televised games except for a specific few licensed by the NCAA staff.\n\nAll but two schools quickly complied. The University of Pennsylvania and Notre Dame protested the order to break contracts for home-game television broadcasts, claiming the right to make their own decisions. Byers objected that such exceptions would invite disaster. The conflict escalated. Byers brandished penalties for games televised without approval. Penn contemplated seeking antitrust protection through the courts. Byers issued a contamination notice, informing any opponent scheduled to play Penn that it would be punished for showing up to compete. In effect, Byers mobilized the college world to isolate the two holdouts in what one sportswriter later called \u201cthe Big Bluff.\u201d\n\nByers won. Penn folded in part because its president, the perennial White House contender Harold Stassen, wanted to mend relations with fellow schools in the emerging Ivy League, which would be formalized in 1954. When Notre Dame also surrendered, Byers conducted exclusive negotiations with the new television networks on behalf of every college team. Joe Rauh Jr., a prominent civil-rights attorney, helped him devise a rationing system to permit only 11 broadcasts a year\u2014the fabled Game of the Week. Byers and Rauh selected a few teams for television exposure, excluding the rest. On June 6, 1952, NBC signed a one-year deal to pay the NCAA $1.14 million for a carefully restricted football package. Byers routed all contractual proceeds through his office. He floated the idea that, to fund an NCAA infrastructure, his organization should take a 60 percent cut; he accepted 12 percent that season. (For later contracts, as the size of television revenues grew exponentially, he backed down to 5 percent.) Proceeds from the first NBC contract were enough to rent an NCAA headquarters, in Kansas City.\n\nOnly one year into his job, Byers had secured enough power and money to regulate all of college sports. Over the next decade, the NCAA\u2019s power grew along with television revenues. Through the efforts of Byers\u2019s deputy and chief lobbyist, Chuck Neinas, the NCAA won an important concession in the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, in which Congress made its granting of a precious antitrust exemption to the National Football League contingent upon the blackout of professional football on Saturdays. Deftly, without even mentioning the NCAA, a rider on the bill carved each weekend into protected broadcast markets: Saturday for college, Sunday for the NFL. The NFL got its antitrust exemption. Byers, having negotiated the NCAA\u2019s television package up to $3.1 million per football season\u2014which was higher than the NFL\u2019s figure in those early years\u2014had made the NCAA into a spectacularly profitable cartel.\n\n\u201cWe Eat What We Kill\u201d\nThe NCAA\u2019s control of college sports still rested on a fragile base, however: the consent of the colleges and universities it governed. For a time, the vast sums of television money delivered to these institutions through Byers\u2019s deals made them willing to submit. But the big football powers grumbled about the portion of the television revenue diverted to nearly a thousand NCAA member schools that lacked major athletic programs. They chafed against cost-cutting measures\u2014such as restrictions on team size\u2014designed to help smaller schools. \u201cI don\u2019t want Hofstra telling Texas how to play football,\u201d Darrell Royal, the Longhorns coach, griped. By the 1970s and \u201980s, as college football games delivered bonanza ratings\u2014and advertising revenue\u2014to the networks, some of the big football schools began to wonder: Why do we need to have our television coverage brokered through the NCAA? Couldn\u2019t we get a bigger cut of that TV money by dealing directly with the networks?\nByers faced a rude internal revolt. The NCAA\u2019s strongest legions, its big football schools, defected en masse. Calling the NCAA a price-fixing cartel that siphoned every television dollar through its coffers, in 1981 a rogue consortium of 61 major football schools threatened to sign an independent contract with NBC for $180 million over four years.\n\nWith a huge chunk of the NCAA\u2019s treasury walking out the door, Byers threatened sanctions, as he had against Penn and Notre Dame three decades earlier. But this time the universities of Georgia and Oklahoma responded with an antitrust suit. \u201cIt is virtually impossible to overstate the degree of our resentment \u2026 of the NCAA,\u201d said William Banowsky, the president of the University of Oklahoma. In the landmark 1984 NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the NCAA\u2019s latest football contracts with television\u2014and any future ones\u2014as an illegal restraint of trade that harmed colleges and viewers. Overnight, the NCAA\u2019s control of the television market for football vanished. Upholding Banowsky\u2019s challenge to the NCAA\u2019s authority, the Regents decision freed the football schools to sell any and all games the markets would bear. Coaches and administrators no longer had to share the revenue generated by their athletes with smaller schools outside the football consortium. \u201cWe eat what we kill,\u201d one official at the University of Texas bragged.\n\nA few years earlier, this blow might have financially crippled the NCAA\u2014but a rising tide of money from basketball concealed the structural damage of the Regents decision. During the 1980s, income from the March Madness college basketball tournament, paid directly by the television networks to the NCAA, grew tenfold. The windfall covered\u2014and then far exceeded\u2014what the organization had lost from football.\n\nStill, Byers never forgave his former deputy Chuck Neinas for leading the rebel consortium. He knew that Neinas had seen from the inside how tenuous the NCAA\u2019s control really was, and how diligently Byers had worked to prop up its Oz-like fa\u00e7ade. During Byers\u2019s tenure, the rule book for Division I athletes grew to 427 pages of scholastic detail. His NCAA personnel manual banned conversations around water coolers, and coffee cups on desks, while specifying exactly when drapes must be drawn at the NCAA\u2019s 27,000-square-foot headquarters near Kansas City (built in 1973 from the proceeds of a 1 percent surtax on football contracts). It was as though, having lost control where it mattered, Byers pedantically exerted more control where it didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter retiring in 1987, Byers let slip his suppressed fury that the ingrate football conferences, having robbed the NCAA of television revenue, still expected it to enforce amateurism rules and police every leak of funds to college players. A lethal greed was \u201cgnawing at the innards of college athletics,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. When Byers renounced the NCAA\u2019s pretense of amateurism, his former colleagues would stare blankly, as though he had gone senile or, as he wrote, \u201cdesecrated my sacred vows.\u201d But Byers was better positioned than anyone else to argue that college football\u2019s claim to amateurism was unfounded. Years later, as we will see, lawyers would seize upon his words to do battle with the NCAA.\n\nMeanwhile, reformers fretted that commercialism was hurting college sports, and that higher education\u2019s historical balance between academics and athletics had been distorted by all the money sloshing around. News stories revealed that schools went to extraordinary measures to keep academically incompetent athletes eligible for competition, and would vie for the most-sought-after high-school players by proffering under-the-table payments. In 1991, the first Knight Commission report, \u201cKeeping Faith With the Student Athlete,\u201d was published; the commission\u2019s \u201cbedrock conviction\u201d was that university presidents must seize control of the NCAA from athletic directors in order to restore the preeminence of academic values over athletic or commercial ones. In response, college presidents did take over the NCAA\u2019s governance. But by 2001, when the second Knight Commission report (\u201cA Call to Action: Reconnecting College Sports and Higher Education\u201d) was issued, a new generation of reformers was admitting that problems of corruption and commercialism had \u201cgrown rather than diminished\u201d since the first report. Meanwhile the NCAA itself, revenues rising, had moved into a $50 million, 116,000-square-foot headquarters in Indianapolis. By 2010, as the size of NCAA headquarters increased yet again with a 130,000-square-foot expansion, a third Knight Commission was groping blindly for a hold on independent college-athletic conferences that were behaving more like sovereign pro leagues than confederations of universities. And still more money continued to flow into NCAA coffers. With the basketball tournament\u2019s 2011 television deal, annual March Madness broadcast revenues had skyrocketed 50-fold in less than 30 years.\n\nThe Myth of the \u201cStudent-Athlete\u201d\nToday, much of the NCAA\u2019s moral authority\u2014indeed much of the justification for its existence\u2014is vested in its claim to protect what it calls the \u201cstudent-athlete.\u201d The term is meant to conjure the nobility of amateurism, and the precedence of scholarship over athletic endeavor. But the origins of the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d lie not in a disinterested ideal but in a sophistic formulation designed, as the sports economist Andrew Zimbalist has written, to help the NCAA in its \u201cfight against workmen\u2019s compensation insurance claims for injured football players.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe crafted the term student-athlete,\u201d Walter Byers himself wrote, \u201cand soon it was embedded in all NCAA rules and interpretations.\u201d The term came into play in the 1950s, when the widow of Ray Dennison, who had died from a head injury received while playing football in Colorado for the Fort Lewis A&M Aggies, filed for workmen\u2019s-compensation death benefits. Did his football scholarship make the fatal collision a \u201cwork-related\u201d accident? Was he a school employee, like his peers who worked part-time as teaching assistants and bookstore cashiers? Or was he a fluke victim of extracurricular pursuits? Given the hundreds of incapacitating injuries to college athletes each year, the answers to these questions had enormous consequences. The Colorado Supreme Court ultimately agreed with the school\u2019s contention that he was not eligible for benefits, since the college was \u201cnot in the football business.\u201d\n\nThe term student-athlete was deliberately ambiguous. College players were not students at play (which might understate their athletic obligations), nor were they just athletes in college (which might imply they were professionals). That they were high-performance athletes meant they could be forgiven for not meeting the academic standards of their peers; that they were students meant they did not have to be compensated, ever, for anything more than the cost of their studies. Student-athlete became the NCAA\u2019s signature term, repeated constantly in and out of courtrooms.\n\nUsing the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d defense, colleges have compiled a string of victories in liability cases. On the afternoon of October 26, 1974, the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs were playing the Alabama Crimson Tide in Birmingham, Alabama. Kent Waldrep, a TCU running back, carried the ball on a \u201cRed Right 28\u201d sweep toward the Crimson Tide\u2019s sideline, where he was met by a swarm of tacklers. When Waldrep regained consciousness, Bear Bryant, the storied Crimson Tide coach, was standing over his hospital bed. \u201cIt was like talking to God, if you\u2019re a young football player,\u201d Waldrep recalled.\n\nWaldrep was paralyzed: he had lost all movement and feeling below his neck. After nine months of paying his medical bills, Texas Christian refused to pay any more, so the Waldrep family coped for years on dwindling charity.\n\nThrough the 1990s, from his wheelchair, Waldrep pressed a lawsuit for workers\u2019 compensation. (He also, through heroic rehabilitation efforts, recovered feeling in his arms, and eventually learned to drive a specially rigged van. \u201cI can brush my teeth,\u201d he told me last year, \u201cbut I still need help to bathe and dress.\u201d) His attorneys haggled with TCU and the state worker-compensation fund over what constituted employment. Clearly, TCU had provided football players with equipment for the job, as a typical employer would\u2014but did the university pay wages, withhold income taxes on his financial aid, or control work conditions and performance? The appeals court finally rejected Waldrep\u2019s claim in June of 2000, ruling that he was not an employee because he had not paid taxes on financial aid that he could have kept even if he quit football. (Waldrep told me school officials \u201csaid they recruited me as a student, not an athlete,\u201d which he says was absurd.)\n\nThe long saga vindicated the power of the NCAA\u2019s \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d formulation as a shield, and the organization continues to invoke it as both a legalistic defense and a noble ideal. Indeed, such is the term\u2019s rhetorical power that it is increasingly used as a sort of reflexive mantra against charges of rabid hypocrisy.\n\nLast Thanksgiving weekend, with both the FBI and the NCAA investigating whether Cam Newton had been lured onto his team with illegal payments, Newton\u2019s Auburn Tigers and the Alabama Crimson Tide came together for their annual game, known as the Iron Bowl, before 101,821 fans at Bryant-Denny Stadium. This game is always a highlight of the football season because of the historic rivalry between the two schools, and the 2010 edition had enormous significance, pitting the defending national champion Crimson Tide against the undefeated Tigers, who were aiming for their first championship since 1957. I expected excited fans; what I encountered was the throbbing heart of college sports. As I drove before daybreak toward the stadium, a sleepless caller babbled over WJOX, the local fan radio station, that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t stop thinking about the coin toss.\u201d In the parking lot, ticketless fans were puzzled that anyone need ask why they had tailgated for days just to watch their satellite-fed flat screens within earshot of the roar. All that morning, pilgrims packed the Bear Bryant museum, where displays elaborated the misery of Alabama\u2019s 4\u201324 run before the glorious Bryant era dawned in 1958.\n\nFinally, as Auburn took the field for warm-ups, one of Alabama\u2019s public-address-system operators played \u201cTake the Money and Run\u201d (an act for which he would be fired). A sea of signs reading $CAM taunted Newton. The game, perhaps the most exciting of the season, was unbearably tense, with Auburn coming from way behind to win 28\u201327, all but assuring that it would go on to play for the national championship. Days later, Auburn suspended Newton after the NCAA found that a rules violation had occurred: his father was alleged to have marketed his son in a pay-for-play scheme; a day after that, the NCAA reinstated Newton\u2019s eligibility because investigators had not found evidence that Newton or Auburn officials had known of his father\u2019s actions. This left Newton conveniently eligible for the Southeastern Conference championship game and for the postseason BCS championship bowl. For the NCAA, prudence meant honoring public demand.\n\n\u201cOur championships,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert has declared, \u201care one of the primary tools we have to enhance the student-athlete experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoremasters\u201d\nNCAA v. Regents left the NCAA devoid of television football revenue and almost wholly dependent on March Madness basketball. It is rich but insecure. Last year, CBS Sports and Turner Broadcasting paid $771 million to the NCAA for television rights to the 2011 men\u2019s basketball tournament alone. That\u2019s three-quarters of a billion dollars built on the backs of amateurs\u2014on unpaid labor. The whole edifice depends on the players\u2019 willingness to perform what is effectively volunteer work. The athletes, and the league officials, are acutely aware of this extraordinary arrangement. William Friday, the former North Carolina president, recalls being yanked from one Knight Commission meeting and sworn to secrecy about what might happen if a certain team made the NCAA championship basketball game. \u201cThey were going to dress and go out on the floor,\u201d Friday told me, \u201cbut refuse to play,\u201d in a wildcat student strike. Skeptics doubted such a diabolical plot. These were college kids\u2014unlikely to second-guess their coaches, let alone forfeit the dream of a championship. Still, it was unnerving to contemplate what hung on the consent of a few young volunteers: several hundred million dollars in television revenue, countless livelihoods, the NCAA budget, and subsidies for sports at more than 1,000 schools. Friday\u2019s informants exhaled when the suspect team lost before the finals.\n\nCognizant of its precarious financial base, the NCAA has in recent years begun to pursue new sources of revenue. Taking its cue from member schools such as Ohio State (which in 2009 bundled all its promotional rights\u2014souvenirs, stadium ads, shoe deals\u2014and outsourced them to the international sports marketer IMG College for a guaranteed $11 million a year), the NCAA began to exploit its vault of college sports on film. For $29.99 apiece, NCAA On Demand offers DVDs of more than 200 memorable contests in men\u2019s ice hockey alone. Video-game technology also allows nostalgic fans to relive and even participate in classic moments of NCAA Basketball. NCAA Football, licensed by the NCAA through IMG College to Electronic Arts, one of the world\u2019s largest video-game manufacturers, reportedly sold 2.5 million copies in 2008. Brit Kirwan, the chancellor of the Maryland university system and a former president at Ohio State, says there were \u201cterrible fights\u201d between the third Knight Commission and the NCAA over the ethics of generating this revenue.\n\nAll of this money ultimately derives from the college athletes whose likenesses are shown in the films or video games. But none of the profits go to them. Last year, Electronic Arts paid more than $35 million in royalties to the NFL players union for the underlying value of names and images in its pro football series\u2014but neither the NCAA nor its affiliated companies paid former college players a nickel. Naturally, as they have become more of a profit center for the NCAA, some of the vaunted \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d have begun to clamor that they deserve a share of those profits. You \u201csee everybody getting richer and richer,\u201d Desmond Howard, who won the 1991 Heisman Trophy while playing for the Michigan Wolverines, told USA Today recently. \u201cAnd you walk around and you can\u2019t put gas in your car? You can\u2019t even fly home to see your parents?\u201d\n\nSome athletes have gone beyond talk. A series of lawsuits quietly making their way through the courts cast a harsh light on the absurdity of the system\u2014and threaten to dislodge the foundations on which the NCAA rests. On July 21, 2009, lawyers for Ed O\u2019Bannon filed a class-action antitrust suit against the NCAA at the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. \u201cOnce you leave your university,\u201d says O\u2019Bannon, who won the John Wooden Award for player of the year in 1995 on UCLA\u2019s national-championship basketball team, \u201cone would think your likeness belongs to you.\u201d The NCAA and UCLA continue to collect money from the sales of videos of him playing. But by NCAA rules, O\u2019Bannon, who today works at a Toyota dealership near Las Vegas, alleges he is still not allowed to share the revenue the NCAA generates from his own image as a college athlete. His suit quickly gathered co-plaintiffs from basketball and football, ex-players featured in NCAA videos and other products. \u201cThe NCAA does not license student-athlete likenesses,\u201d NCAA spokesperson Erik Christianson told The New York Times in response to the suit, \u201cor prevent former student-athletes from attempting to do so. Likewise, to claim the NCAA profits off student-athlete likenesses is also pure fiction.\u201d\n\nThe legal contention centers on Part IV of the NCAA\u2019s \u201cStudent-Athlete Statement\u201d for Division I, which requires every athlete to authorize use of \u201cyour name or picture \u2026 to promote NCAA championships or other NCAA events, activities or programs.\u201d Does this clause mean that athletes clearly renounce personal interest forever? If so, does it actually undermine the NCAA by implicitly recognizing that athletes have a property right in their own performance? Jon King, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, expects the NCAA\u2019s core mission of amateurism to be its \u201clast defense standing.\u201d\n\nIn theory, the NCAA\u2019s passion to protect the noble amateurism of college athletes should prompt it to focus on head coaches in the high-revenue sports\u2014basketball and football\u2014since holding the top official accountable should most efficiently discourage corruption. The problem is that the coaches\u2019 growing power has rendered them, unlike their players, ever more immune to oversight. According to research by Charles Clotfelter, an economist at Duke, the average compensation for head football coaches at public universities, now more than $2 million, has grown 750 percent (adjusted for inflation) since the Regents decision in 1984; that\u2019s more than 20 times the cumulative 32 percent raise for college professors. For top basketball coaches, annual contracts now exceed $4 million, augmented by assorted bonuses, endorsements, country-club memberships, the occasional private plane, and in some cases a negotiated percentage of ticket receipts. (Oregon\u2019s ticket concessions netted former football coach Mike Bellotti an additional $631,000 in 2005.)\n\nThe NCAA rarely tangles with such people, who are apt to fight back and win. When Rick Neuheisel, the head football coach of the Washington Huskies, was punished for petty gambling (in a March Madness pool, as it happened), he sued the NCAA and the university for wrongful termination, collected $4.5 million, and later moved on to UCLA. When the NCAA tried to cap assistant coaches\u2019 entering salary at a mere $16,000, nearly 2,000 of them brought an antitrust suit, Law v. NCAA, and in 1999 settled for $54.5 million. Since then, salaries for assistant coaches have commonly exceeded $200,000, with the top assistants in the SEC averaging $700,000. In 2009, Monte Kiffin, then at the University of Tennessee, became the first assistant coach to reach $1 million, plus benefits.\n\nThe late Myles Brand, who led the NCAA from 2003 to 2009, defended the economics of college sports by claiming that they were simply the result of a smoothly functioning free market. He and his colleagues deflected criticism about the money saturating big-time college sports by focusing attention on scapegoats; in 2010, outrage targeted sports agents. Last year Sports Illustrated published \u201cConfessions of an Agent,\u201d a firsthand account of dealing with high-strung future pros whom the agent and his peers courted with flattery, cash, and tawdry favors. Nick Saban, Alabama\u2019s head football coach, mobilized his peers to denounce agents as a public scourge. \u201cI hate to say this,\u201d he said, \u201cbut how are they any better than a pimp? I have no respect for people who do that to young people. None.\u201d\n\nSaban\u2019s raw condescension contrasts sharply with the lonely penitence from Dale Brown, the retired longtime basketball coach at LSU. \u201cLook at the money we make off predominantly poor black kids,\u201d Brown once reflected. \u201cWe\u2019re the whoremasters.\u201d\n\n\u201cPicayune Rules\u201d\nNCAA officials have tried to assert their dominion\u2014and distract attention from the larger issues\u2014by chasing frantically after petty violations. Tom McMillen, a former member of the Knight Commission who was an All-American basketball player at the University of Maryland, likens these officials to traffic cops in a speed trap, who could flag down almost any passing motorist for prosecution in kangaroo court under a \u201cmaze of picayune rules.\u201d The publicized cases have become convoluted soap operas. At the start of the 2010 football season, A. J. Green, a wide receiver at Georgia, confessed that he\u2019d sold his own jersey from the Independence Bowl the year before, to raise cash for a spring-break vacation. The NCAA sentenced Green to a four-game suspension for violating his amateur status with the illicit profit generated by selling the shirt off his own back. While he served the suspension, the Georgia Bulldogs store continued legally selling replicas of Green\u2019s No. 8 jersey for $39.95 and up.\n\nA few months later, the NCAA investigated rumors that Ohio State football players had benefited from \u201chook-ups on tatts\u201d\u2014that is, that they\u2019d gotten free or underpriced tattoos at an Ohio tattoo parlor in exchange for autographs and memorabilia\u2014a violation of the NCAA\u2019s rule against discounts linked to athletic personae. The NCAA Committee on Infractions imposed five-game suspensions on Terrelle Pryor, Ohio State\u2019s tattooed quarterback, and four other players (some of whom had been found to have sold their Big Ten championship rings and other gear), but did permit them to finish the season and play in the Sugar Bowl. (This summer, in an attempt to satisfy NCAA investigators, Ohio State voluntarily vacated its football wins from last season, as well as its Sugar Bowl victory.) A different NCAA committee promulgated a rule banning symbols and messages in players\u2019 eyeblack\u2014reportedly aimed at Pryor\u2019s controversial gesture of support for the pro quarterback Michael Vick, and at Bible verses inscribed in the eyeblack of the former Florida quarterback Tim Tebow.\n\nThe moral logic is hard to fathom: the NCAA bans personal messages on the bodies of the players, and penalizes players for trading their celebrity status for discounted tattoos\u2014but it codifies precisely how and where commercial insignia from multinational corporations can be displayed on college players, for the financial benefit of the colleges. Last season, while the NCAA investigated him and his father for the recruiting fees they\u2019d allegedly sought, Cam Newton compliantly wore at least 15 corporate logos\u2014one on his jersey, four on his helmet visor, one on each wristband, one on his pants, six on his shoes, and one on the headband he wears under his helmet\u2014as part of Auburn\u2019s $10.6 million deal with Under Armour.\n\n\u201cRestitution\u201d\nObscure NCAA rules have bedeviled Scott Boras, the preeminent sports agent for Major League Baseball stars, in cases that may ultimately prove more threatening to the NCAA than Ed O\u2019Bannon\u2019s antitrust suit. In 2008, Andrew Oliver, a sophomore pitcher for the Oklahoma State Cowboys, had been listed as the 12th-best professional prospect among sophomore players nationally. He decided to dismiss the two attorneys who had represented him out of high school, Robert and Tim Baratta, and retain Boras instead. Infuriated, the Barattas sent a spiteful letter to the NCAA. Oliver didn\u2019t learn about this until the night before he was scheduled to pitch in the regional final for a place in the College World Series, when an NCAA investigator showed up to question him in the presence of lawyers for Oklahoma State. The investigator also questioned his father, Dave, a truck driver.\n\nHad Tim Baratta been present in their home when the Minnesota Twins offered $390,000 for Oliver to sign out of high school? A yes would mean trouble. While the NCAA did not forbid all professional advice\u2014indeed, Baseball America used to publish the names of agents representing draft-likely underclassmen\u2014NCAA Bylaw 12.3.2.1 prohibited actual negotiation with any professional team by an adviser, on pain of disqualification for the college athlete. The questioning lasted past midnight.\n\nJust hours before the game was to start the next day, Oklahoma State officials summoned Oliver to tell him he would not be pitching. Only later did he learn that the university feared that by letting him play while the NCAA adjudicated his case, the university would open not only the baseball team but all other Oklahoma State teams to broad punishment under the NCAA\u2019s \u201crestitution rule\u201d (Bylaw 19.7), under which the NCAA threatens schools with sanctions if they obey any temporary court order benefiting a college athlete, should that order eventually be modified or removed. The baseball coach did not even let his ace tell his teammates the sad news in person. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s probably not a good idea for you to be at the game,\u2019\u201d Oliver recalls.\n\nThe Olivers went home to Ohio to find a lawyer. Rick Johnson, a solo practitioner specializing in legal ethics, was aghast that the Baratta brothers had turned in their own client to the NCAA, divulging attorney-client details likely to invite wrath upon Oliver. But for the next 15 months, Johnson directed his litigation against the two NCAA bylaws at issue. Judge Tygh M. Tone, of Erie County, came to share his outrage. On February 12, 2009, Tone struck down the ban on lawyers negotiating for student-athletes as a capricious, exploitative attempt by a private association to \u201cdictate to an attorney where, what, how, or when he should represent his client,\u201d violating accepted legal practice in every state. He also struck down the NCAA\u2019s restitution rule as an intimidation that attempted to supersede the judicial system. Finally, Judge Tone ordered the NCAA to reinstate Oliver\u2019s eligibility at Oklahoma State for his junior season, which started several days later.\n\nThe NCAA sought to disqualify Oliver again, with several appellate motions to stay \u201can unprecedented Order purporting to void a fundamental Bylaw.\u201d Oliver did get to pitch that season, but he dropped into the second round of the June 2009 draft, signing for considerably less than if he\u2019d been picked earlier. Now 23, Oliver says sadly that the whole experience \u201cmade me grow up a little quicker.\u201d His lawyer claimed victory. \u201cAndy Oliver is the first college athlete ever to win against the NCAA in court,\u201d said Rick Johnson.\n\nYet the victory was only temporary. Wounded, the NCAA fought back with a vengeance. Its battery of lawyers prepared for a damages trial, ultimately overwhelming Oliver\u2019s side eight months later with an offer to resolve the dispute for $750,000. When Oliver and Johnson accepted, to extricate themselves ahead of burgeoning legal costs, Judge Tone was compelled to vacate his orders as part of the final settlement. This freed NCAA officials to reassert the two bylaws that Judge Tone had so forcefully overturned, and they moved swiftly to ramp up rather than curtail enforcement. First, the NCAA\u2019s Eligibility Center devised a survey for every drafted undergraduate athlete who sought to stay in college another year. The survey asked whether an agent had conducted negotiations. It also requested a signed release waiving privacy rights and authorizing professional teams to disclose details of any interaction to the NCAA Eligibility Center. Second, NCAA enforcement officials went after another Scott Boras client.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays had made the left-handed pitcher James Paxton, of the University of Kentucky, the 37th pick in the 2009 draft. Paxton decided to reject a reported $1 million offer and return to school for his senior year, pursuing a dream to pitch for his team in the College World Series. But then he ran into the new NCAA survey. Had Boras negotiated with the Blue Jays? Boras has denied that he did, but it would have made sense that he had\u2014that was his job, to test the market for his client. But saying so would get Paxton banished under the same NCAA bylaw that had derailed Andrew Oliver\u2019s career. Since Paxton was planning to go back to school and not accept their draft offer, the Blue Jays no longer had any incentive to protect him\u2014indeed, they had every incentive to turn him in. The Blue Jays\u2019 president, by telling reporters that Boras had negotiated on Paxton\u2019s behalf, demonstrated to future recruits and other teams that they could use the NCAA\u2019s rules to punish college players who wasted their draft picks by returning to college. The NCAA\u2019s enforcement staff raised the pressure by requesting to interview Paxton.\n\nThough Paxton had no legal obligation to talk to an investigator, NCAA Bylaw 10.1(j) specified that anything short of complete cooperation could be interpreted as unethical conduct, affecting his amateur status. Under its restitution rule, the NCAA had leverage to compel the University of Kentucky to ensure obedience.\n\nAs the 2010 season approached, Gary Henderson, the Kentucky coach, sorely wanted Paxton, one of Baseball America\u2019s top-ranked players, to return. Rick Johnson, Andrew Oliver\u2019s lawyer, filed for a declaratory judgment on Paxton\u2019s behalf, arguing that the state constitution\u2014plus the university\u2019s code of student conduct\u2014barred arbitrary discipline at the request of a third party. Kentucky courts deferred to the university, however, and Paxton was suspended from the team. \u201cDue to the possibility of future penalties, including forfeiture of games,\u201d the university stated, it \u201ccould not put the other 32 players of the team and the entire UK 22-sport intercollegiate athletics department at risk by having James compete.\u201d The NCAA appraised the result with satisfaction. \u201cWhen negotiations occur on behalf of student-athletes,\u201d Erik Christianson, the NCAA spokesperson, told The New York Times in reference to the Oliver case, \u201cthose negotiations indicate that the student-athlete intends to become a professional athlete and no longer remain an amateur.\u201d\n\nPaxton was stranded. Not only could he not play for Kentucky, but his draft rights with the Blue Jays had lapsed for the year, meaning he could not play for any minor-league affiliate of Major League Baseball. Boras wrangled a holdover job for him in Texas with the independent Grand Prairie AirHogs, pitching against the Pensacola Pelicans and Wichita Wingnuts. Once projected to be a first-round draft pick, Paxton saw his stock plummet into the fourth round. He remained unsigned until late in spring training, when he signed with the Seattle Mariners and reported to their minor-league camp in Peoria, Arizona.\n\n\u201cYou Might As Well Shoot Them in the Head\u201d\n\u201cWhen you dream about playing in college,\u201d Joseph Agnew told me not long ago, \u201cyou don\u2019t ever think about being in a lawsuit.\u201d Agnew, a student at Rice University in Houston, had been cut from the football team and had his scholarship revoked by Rice before his senior year, meaning that he faced at least $35,000 in tuition and other bills if he wanted to complete his degree in sociology. Bereft of his scholarship, he was flailing about for help when he discovered the National College Players Association, which claims 7,000 active members and seeks modest reforms such as safety guidelines and better death benefits for college athletes. Agnew was struck by the NCPA scholarship data on players from top Division I basketball teams, which showed that 22 percent were not renewed from 2008 to 2009\u2014the same fate he had suffered.\n\nIn October 2010, Agnew filed a class-action antitrust suit over the cancellation of his scholarship and to remove the cap on the total number of scholarships that can be awarded by NCAA schools. In his suit, Agnew did not claim the right to free tuition. He merely asked the federal court to strike down an NCAA rule, dating to 1973, that prohibited colleges and universities from offering any athletic scholarship longer than a one-year commitment, to be renewed or not, unilaterally, by the school\u2014which in practice means that coaches get to decide each year whose scholarships to renew or cancel. (After the coach who had recruited Agnew had moved on to Tulsa, the new Rice coach switched Agnew\u2019s scholarship to a recruit of his own.) Agnew argued that without the one-year rule, he would have been free to bargain with all eight colleges that had recruited him, and each college could have decided how long to guarantee his scholarship.\n\nAgnew\u2019s suit rested on a claim of an NCAA antitrust violation combined with a laudable academic goal\u2014making it possible for students to finish their educations. Around the same time, lawyers from President Obama\u2019s Justice Department initiated a series of meetings with NCAA officials and universities in which they asked what possible educational rationale there was for allowing the NCAA\u2014an organization that did not itself pay for scholarships\u2014to impose a blanket restriction on the length of scholarships offered by colleges. Tidbits leaked into the press. In response, the NCAA contended that an athletic scholarship was a \u201cmerit award\u201d that should be reviewed annually, presumably because the degree of \u201cmerit\u201d could change. Justice Department lawyers reportedly suggested that a free market in scholarships would expand learning opportunities in accord with the stated rationale for the NCAA\u2019s tax-exempt status\u2014that it promotes education through athletics. The one-year rule effectively allows colleges to cut underperforming \u201cstudent-athletes,\u201d just as pro sports teams cut their players. \u201cPlenty of them don\u2019t stay in school,\u201d said one of Agnew\u2019s lawyers, Stuart Paynter. \u201cThey\u2019re just gone. You might as well shoot them in the head.\u201d\n\nAgnew\u2019s lawsuit has made him a pariah to former friends in the athletic department at Rice, where everyone identified so thoroughly with the NCAA that they seemed to feel he was attacking them personally. But if the premise of Agnew\u2019s case is upheld by the courts, it will make a sham of the NCAA\u2019s claim that its highest priority is protecting education.\n\n\u201cThey Want to Crush These Kids\u201d\nAcademic performance has always been difficult for the NCAA to address. Any detailed regulation would intrude upon the free choice of widely varying schools, and any academic standard broad enough to fit both MIT and Ole Miss would have little force. From time to time, a scandal will expose extreme lapses. In 1989, Dexter Manley, by then the famous \u201cSecretary of Defense\u201d for the NFL\u2019s Washington Redskins, teared up before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Education, Arts, and Humanities, when admitting that he had been functionally illiterate in college.\n\nWithin big-time college athletic departments, the financial pressure to disregard obvious academic shortcomings and shortcuts is just too strong. In the 1980s, Jan Kemp, an English instructor at the University of Georgia, publicly alleged that university officials had demoted and then fired her because she refused to inflate grades in her remedial English courses. Documents showed that administrators replaced the grades she\u2019d given athletes with higher ones, providing fake passing grades on one notable occasion to nine Bulldog football players who otherwise would have been ineligible to compete in the 1982 Sugar Bowl. (Georgia lost anyway, 24\u201320, to a University of Pittsburgh team led by the future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino.) When Kemp filed a lawsuit against the university, she was publicly vilified as a troublemaker, but she persisted bravely in her testimony. Once, Kemp said, a supervisor demanding that she fix a grade had bellowed, \u201cWho do you think is more important to this university, you or Dominique Wilkins?\u201d (Wilkins was a star on the basketball team.) Traumatized, Kemp twice attempted suicide.\n\nIn trying to defend themselves, Georgia officials portrayed Kemp as naive about sports. \u201cWe have to compete on a level playing field,\u201d said Fred Davison, the university president. During the Kemp civil trial, in 1986, Hale Almand, Georgia\u2019s defense lawyer, explained the university\u2019s patronizing aspirations for its typical less-than-scholarly athlete. \u201cWe may not make a university student out of him,\u201d Almand told the court, \u201cbut if we can teach him to read and write, maybe he can work at the post office rather than as a garbage man when he gets through with his athletic career.\u201d This argument backfired with the jurors: finding in favor of Kemp, they rejected her polite request for $100,000, and awarded her $2.6 million in damages instead. (This was later reduced to $1.08 million.) Jan Kemp embodied what is ostensibly the NCAA\u2019s reason for being\u2014to enforce standards fairly and put studies above sports\u2014but no one from the organization ever spoke up on her behalf.\n\nTHE NCAA BODY charged with identifying violations of any of the Division I league rules, the Committee on Infractions, operates in the shadows. Josephine Potuto, a professor of law at the University of Nebraska and a longtime committee member who was then serving as its vice chair, told Congress in 2004 that one reason her group worked in secret was that it hoped to avoid a \u201cmedia circus.\u201d The committee preferred to deliberate in private, she said, guiding member schools to punish themselves. \u201cThe enforcement process is cooperative, not adversarial,\u201d Potuto testified. The committee consisted of an elite coterie of judges, athletic directors, and authors of legal treatises. \u201cThe committee also is savvy about intercollegiate athletics,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cannot be conned.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, a series of unlikely circumstances peeled back the veil of secrecy to reveal NCAA procedures so contorted that even victims marveled at their comical wonder. The saga began in March of 2007, shortly after the Florida State Seminoles basketball team was knocked out of the NIT basketball tournament, which each spring invites the best teams not selected for the March Madness tournament. At an athletic-department study hall, Al Thornton, a star forward for the team, completed a sports-psychology quiz but then abandoned it without posting his written answers electronically by computer. Brenda Monk, an academic tutor for the Seminoles, says she noticed the error and asked a teammate to finish entering Thornton\u2019s answers onscreen and hit \u201csubmit,\u201d as required for credit. The teammate complied, steaming silently, and then complained at the athletic office about getting stuck with clean-up chores for the superstar Thornton (who was soon to be selected by the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the NBA draft). Monk promptly resigned when questioned by FSU officials, saying her fatigue at the time could not excuse her asking the teammate to submit the answers to another student\u2019s completed test.\n\nMonk\u2019s act of guileless responsibility set off a chain reaction. First, FSU had to give the NCAA preliminary notice of a confessed academic fraud. Second, because this would be its seventh major infraction case since 1968, FSU mounted a vigorous self-investigation to demonstrate compliance with NCAA academic rules. Third, interviews with 129 Seminoles athletes unleashed a nightmare of matter-of-fact replies about absentee professors who allowed group consultations and unlimited retakes of open-computer assignments and tests. Fourth, FSU suspended 61 of its athletes in 10 sports. Fifth, the infractions committee applied the byzantine NCAA bylaws to FSU\u2019s violations. Sixth, one of the penalties announced in March of 2009 caused a howl of protest across the sports universe.\n\nTwenty-seven news organizations filed a lawsuit in hopes of finding out how and why the NCAA proposed to invalidate 14 prior victories in FSU football. Such a penalty, if upheld, would doom coach Bobby Bowden\u2019s chance of overtaking Joe Paterno of Penn State for the most football wins in Division I history. This was sacrosanct territory. Sports reporters followed the litigation for six months, reporting that 25 of the 61 suspended FSU athletes were football players, some of whom were ruled ineligible retroactively from the time they had heard or yelled out answers to online test questions in, of all things, a music-appreciation course.\n\nWhen reporters sought access to the transcript of the infractions committee\u2019s hearing in Indianapolis, NCAA lawyers said the 695-page document was private. (The NCAA claimed it was entitled to keep all such records secret because of a landmark Supreme Court ruling that it had won in 1988, in NCAA v. Tarkanian, which exempted the organization from any due-process obligations because it was not a government organization.) Media outlets pressed the judge to let Florida State share its own copy of the hearing transcript, whereupon NCAA lawyers objected that the school had never actually \u201cpossessed\u201d the document; it had only seen the transcript via a defendant\u2019s guest access to the carefully restricted NCAA Web site. This claim, in turn, prompted intercession on the side of the media by Florida\u2019s attorney general, arguing that letting the NCAA use a technical loophole like this would undermine the state\u2019s sunshine law mandating open public records. After tumultuous appeals, the Florida courts agreed and ordered the NCAA transcript released in October of 2009.\n\nNews interest quickly evaporated when the sports media found nothing in the record about Coach Bowden or the canceled football victories. But the transcript revealed plenty about the NCAA. On page 37, T. K. Wetherell, the bewildered Florida State president, lamented that his university had hurt itself by cooperating with the investigation. \u201cWe self-reported this case,\u201d he said during the hearing, and he later complained that the most ingenuous athletes\u2014those who asked \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal, this happens all the time?\u201d\u2014received the harshest suspensions, while those who clammed up on the advice of lawyers went free. The music-appreciation professor was apparently never questioned. Brenda Monk, the only instructor who consistently cooperated with the investigation, appeared voluntarily to explain her work with learning-disabled athletes, only to be grilled about her credentials by Potuto in a pettifogging inquisition of remarkable stamina.\n\nIn January of last year, the NCAA\u2019s Infractions Appeals Committee sustained all the sanctions imposed on FSU except the number of vacated football victories, which it dropped, ex cathedra, from 14 to 12. The final penalty locked Bobby Bowden\u2019s official win total on retirement at 377 instead of 389, behind Joe Paterno\u2019s 401 (and counting). This carried stinging symbolism for fans, without bringing down on the NCAA the harsh repercussions it would have risked if it had issued a television ban or substantial fine.\n\nCruelly, but typically, the NCAA concentrated public censure on powerless scapegoats. A dreaded \u201cshow cause\u201d order rendered Brenda Monk, the tutor, effectively unhirable at any college in the United States. Cloaking an old-fashioned blackball in the stately language of law, the order gave notice that any school hiring Monk before a specified date in 2013 \u201cshall, pursuant to the provisions of Bylaw 19.5.2.2(l), show cause why it should not be penalized if it does not restrict the former learning specialist [Monk] from having any contact with student-athletes.\u201d Today she works as an education supervisor at a prison in Florida.\n\nTHE FLORIDA STATE verdict hardly surprised Rick Johnson, the lawyer who had represented the college pitchers Andrew Oliver and James Paxton. \u201cAll the NCAA\u2019s enforcements are random and selective,\u201d he told me, calling the organization\u2019s appeals process a travesty. (Johnson says the NCAA has never admitted to having wrongly suspended an athlete.) Johnson\u2019s scalding experience prompted him to undertake a law-review article on the subject, which in turn sent him trawling through NCAA archives. From the summary tax forms required of nonprofits, he found out that the NCAA had spent nearly $1 million chartering private jets in 2006. \u201cWhat kind of nonprofit organization leases private jets?,\u201d Johnson asks. It\u2019s hard to determine from tax returns what money goes where, but it looks as if the NCAA spent less than 1 percent of its budget on enforcement that year. Even after its plump cut for its own overhead, the NCAA dispersed huge sums to its 1,200 member schools, in the manner of a professional sports league. These annual payments are universal\u2014every college gets something\u2014but widely uneven. They keep the disparate shareholders (barely) united and speaking for all of college sports. The payments coerce unity within the structure of a private association that is unincorporated and unregulated, exercising amorphous powers not delegated by any government.\n\nSearching through the archives, Johnson came across a 1973 memo from the NCAA general counsel recommending the adoption of a due-process procedure for athletes in disciplinary cases. Without it, warned the organization\u2019s lawyer, the association risked big liability claims for deprivation of rights. His proposal went nowhere. Instead, apparently to limit costs to the universities, Walter Byers had implemented the year-by-year scholarship rule that Joseph Agnew would challenge in court 37 years later. Moreover, the NCAA\u2019s 1975 convention adopted a second recommendation \u201cto discourage legal actions against the NCAA,\u201d according to the minutes. The members voted to create Bylaw 19.7, Restitution, to intimidate college athletes in disputes with the NCAA. Johnson recognized this provision all too well, having won the temporary court judgment that the rule was illegal if not downright despotic. It made him nearly apoplectic to learn that the NCAA had deliberately drawn up the restitution rule as an obstacle to due process, contrary to the recommendation of its own lawyer. \u201cThey want to crush these kids,\u201d he says.\n\nThe NCAA, of course, has never expressed such a desire, and its public comments on due process tend to be anodyne. At a congressional hearing in 2004, the infractions-committee vice chair, Josephine Potuto, repeatedly argued that although the NCAA is \u201cnot bound by any judicial due process standards,\u201d its enforcement, infractions, and hearing procedures meet and \u201cvery likely exceed\u201d those of other public institutions. Yet when pressed, Potuto declared that athletes would have no standing for due process even if the Supreme Court had not exempted the NCAA in the 1988 Tarkanian decision. \u201cIn order to reach due-process issues as a legal Constitutional principle, the individual challenging has to have a substantive property or liberty interest,\u201d she testified. \u201cThe opportunity to play intercollegiate athletics does not rise to that level.\u201d\n\nTo translate this from the legal jargon, Potuto used a circular argument to confine college athletes beneath any right to freedom or property in their own athletic effort. They have no stake to seek their rights, she claimed, because they have no rights at stake.\n\nPotuto\u2019s assertion might be judged preposterous, an heir of the Dred Scott dictum that slaves possessed no rights a white person was bound to respect. But she was merely being honest, articulating assumptions almost everyone shares without question. Whether motivated by hostility for students (as critics like Johnson allege), or by noble and paternalistic tough love (as the NCAA professes), the denial of fundamental due process for college athletes has stood unchallenged in public discourse. Like other NCAA rules, it emanates naturally from the premise that college athletes own no interest in sports beyond exercise, character-building, and good fun. Who represents these young men and women? No one asks.\n\nThe debates and commissions about reforming college sports nibble around the edges\u2014trying to reduce corruption, to prevent the \u201ccontamination\u201d of athletes by lucre, and to maintain at least a pretense of concern for academic integrity. Everything stands on the implicit presumption that preserving amateurism is necessary for the well-being of college athletes. But while amateurism\u2014and the free labor it provides\u2014may be necessary to the preservation of the NCAA, and perhaps to the profit margins of various interested corporations and educational institutions, what if it doesn\u2019t benefit the athletes? What if it hurts them?\n\n\u201cThe Plantation Mentality\u201d\n\u201cNinety percent of the NCAA revenue is produced by 1 percent of the athletes,\u201d Sonny Vaccaro says. \u201cGo to the skill positions\u201d\u2014the stars. \u201cNinety percent African Americans.\u201d The NCAA made its money off those kids, and so did he. They were not all bad people, the NCAA officials, but they were blind, Vaccaro believes. \u201cTheir organization is a fraud.\u201d\n\nVaccaro retired from Reebok in 2007 to make a clean break for a crusade. \u201cThe kids and their parents gave me a good life,\u201d he says in his peppery staccato. \u201cI want to give something back.\u201d Call it redemption, he told me. Call it education or a good cause. \u201cHere\u2019s what I preach,\u201d said Vaccaro. \u201cThis goes beyond race, to human rights. The least educated are the most exploited. I\u2019m probably closer to the kids than anyone else, and I\u2019m 71 years old.\u201d\n\nVaccaro is officially an unpaid consultant to the plaintiffs in O\u2019Bannon v. NCAA. He connected Ed O\u2019Bannon with the attorneys who now represent him, and he talked to some of the additional co-plaintiffs who have joined the suit, among them Oscar Robertson, a basketball Hall of Famer who was incensed that the NCAA was still selling his image on playing cards 50 years after he left the University of Cincinnati.\n\nJon King, an antitrust lawyer at Hausfeld LLP in San Francisco, told me that Vaccaro \u201copened our eyes to massive revenue streams hidden in college sports.\u201d King and his colleagues have drawn on Vaccaro\u2019s vast knowledge of athletic-department finances, which include off-budget accounts for shoe contracts. Sonny Vaccaro and his wife, Pam, \u201chad a mountain of documents,\u201d he said. The outcome of the 1984 Regents decision validated an antitrust approach for O\u2019Bannon, King argues, as well as for Joseph Agnew in his continuing case against the one-year scholarship rule. Lawyers for Sam Keller\u2014a former quarterback for the University of Nebraska who is featured in video games\u2014are pursuing a parallel \u201cright of publicity\u201d track based on the First Amendment. Still other lawyers could revive Rick Johnson\u2019s case against NCAA bylaws on a larger scale, and King thinks claims for the rights of college players may be viable also under laws pertaining to contracts, employment, and civil rights.\n\nVaccaro had sought a law firm for O\u2019Bannon with pockets deep enough to withstand an expensive war of attrition, fearing that NCAA officials would fight discovery to the end. So far, though, they have been forthcoming. \u201cThe numbers are off the wall,\u201d Vaccaro says. \u201cThe public will see for the first time how all the money is distributed.\u201d\n\nVaccaro has been traveling the after-dinner circuit, proselytizing against what he sees as the NCAA\u2019s exploitation of young athletes. Late in 2008, someone who heard his stump speech at Howard University mentioned it to Michael Hausfeld, a prominent antitrust and human-rights lawyer, whose firm had won suits against Exxon for Native Alaskans and against Union Bank of Switzerland for Holocaust victims\u2019 families. Someone tracked down Vaccaro on vacation in Athens, Greece, and he flew back directly to meet Hausfeld. The shoe salesman and the white-shoe lawyer made common cause.\n\nHausfeld LLP has offices in San Francisco, Philadelphia, and London. Its headquarters are on K Street in Washington, D.C., about three blocks from the White House. When I talked with Hausfeld there not long ago, he sat in a cavernous conference room, tidy in pinstripes, hands folded on a spotless table that reflected the skyline. He spoke softly, without pause, condensing the complex fugue of antitrust litigation into simple sentences. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the basic question,\u201d he said, noting that the NCAA claims that student-athletes have no property rights in their own athletic accomplishments. Yet, in order to be eligible to play, college athletes have to waive their rights to proceeds from any sales based on their athletic performance.\n\n\u201cWhat right is it that they\u2019re waiving?,\u201d Hausfeld asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t waive something you don\u2019t have. So they had a right that they gave up in consideration to the principle of amateurism, if there be such.\u201d (At an April hearing in a U.S. District Court in California, Gregory Curtner, a representative for the NCAA, stunned O\u2019Bannon\u2019s lawyers by saying: \u201cThere is no document, there is no substance, that the NCAA ever takes from the student-athletes their rights of publicity or their rights of likeness. They are at all times owned by the student-athlete.\u201d Jon King says this is \u201clike telling someone they have the winning lottery ticket, but by the way, it can only be cashed in on Mars.\u201d The court denied for a second time an NCAA motion to dismiss the O\u2019Bannon complaint.)\n\nThe waiver clause is nestled among the paragraphs of the \u201cStudent-Athlete Statement\u201d that NCAA rules require be collected yearly from every college athlete. In signing the statement, the athletes attest that they have amateur status, that their stated SAT scores are valid, that they are willing to disclose any educational documents requested, and so forth. Already, Hausfeld said, the defendants in the Ed O\u2019Bannon case have said in court filings that college athletes thereby transferred their promotional rights forever. He paused. \u201cThat\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody assigns rights like that. Nobody can assert rights like that.\u201d He said the pattern demonstrated clear abuse by the collective power of the schools and all their conferences under the NCAA umbrella\u2014\u201ca most effective cartel.\u201d\n\nThe faux ideal of amateurism is \u201cthe elephant in the room,\u201d Hausfeld said, sending for a book. \u201cYou can\u2019t get to the bottom of our case without exposing the hypocrisy of amateurism, and Walter Byers says it eloquently.\u201d An assistant brought in Byers\u2019s memoir. It looked garish on the shiny table because dozens of pink Post-its protruded from the text. Hausfeld read to me from page 390:\n\nThe college player cannot sell his own feet (the coach does that) nor can he sell his own name (the college will do that). This is the plantation mentality resurrected and blessed by today\u2019s campus executives.\nHe looked up. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the NCAA\u2019s architect.\u201d He found a key recommendation on page 388:\n\nProsecutors and the courts, with the support of the public, should use antitrust laws to break up the collegiate cartel\u2014not just in athletics but possibly in other aspects of collegiate life as well.\nCould the book become evidence? Might the aged Byers testify? (He is now 89.) Was that part of the plaintiffs\u2019 strategy for the O\u2019Bannon trial? Hausfeld smiled faintly. \u201cI\u2019d rather the NCAA lawyers not fully understand the strategy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe put the spiny book away and previewed what lies ahead. The court soon would qualify his clients as a class. Then the Sherman Antitrust Act would provide for thorough discovery to break down exactly what the NCAA receives on everything from video clips to jerseys, contract by contract. \u201cAnd we want to know what they\u2019re carrying on their books as the value of their archival footage,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThey say it\u2019s a lot of money. We agree. How much?\u201d\n\nThe work will be hard, but Hausfeld said he will win in the courts, unless the NCAA folds first. \u201cWhy?\u201d Hausfeld asked rhetorically. \u201cWe know our clients are foreclosed: neither the NCAA nor its members will permit them to participate in any of that licensing revenue. Under the law, it\u2019s up to them [the defendants] to give a pro-competitive justification. They can\u2019t. End of story.\u201d\n\nIN 2010 THE third Knight Commission, complementing a previous commission\u2019s recommendation for published reports on academic progress, called for the finances of college sports to be made transparent and public\u2014television contracts, conference budgets, shoe deals, coaches\u2019 salaries, stadium bonds, everything. The recommendation was based on the worthy truism that sunlight is a proven disinfectant. But in practice, it has not been applied at all. Conferences, coaches, and other stakeholders resisted disclosure; college players still have no way of determining their value to the university.\n\n\u201cMoney surrounds college sports,\u201d says Domonique Foxworth, who is a cornerback for the NFL\u2019s Baltimore Ravens and an executive-committee member for the NFL Players Association, and played for the University of Maryland. \u201cAnd every player knows those millions are floating around only because of the 18-to-22-year-olds.\u201d Yes, he told me, even the second-string punter believes a miracle might lift him into the NFL, and why not? In all the many pages of the three voluminous Knight Commission reports, there is but one paragraph that addresses the real-life choices for college athletes. \u201cApproximately 1 percent of NCAA men\u2019s basketball players and 2 percent of NCAA football players are drafted by NBA or NFL teams,\u201d stated the 2001 report, basing its figures on a review of the previous 10 years, \u201cand just being drafted is no assurance of a successful professional career.\u201d Warning that the odds against professional athletic success are \u201castronomically high,\u201d the Knight Commission counsels college athletes to avoid a \u201crude surprise\u201d and to stick to regular studies. This is sound advice as far as it goes, but it\u2019s a bromide that pinches off discussion. Nothing in the typical college curriculum teaches a sweat-stained guard at Clemson or Purdue what his monetary value to the university is. Nothing prods students to think independently about amateurism\u2014because the universities themselves have too much invested in its preservation. Stifling thought, the universities, in league with the NCAA, have failed their own primary mission by providing an empty, cynical education on college sports.\n\nThe most basic reform would treat the students as what they are\u2014adults, with rights and reason of their own\u2014and grant them a meaningful voice in NCAA deliberations. A restoration of full citizenship to \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d would facilitate open governance, making it possible to enforce pledges of transparency in both academic standards and athletic finances. Without that, the NCAA has no effective checks and balances, no way for the students to provide informed consent regarding the way they are governed. A thousand questions lie willfully silenced because the NCAA is naturally afraid of giving \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d a true voice. Would college players be content with the augmented scholarship or allowance now requested by the National College Players Association? If a player\u2019s worth to the university is greater than the value of his scholarship (as it clearly is in some cases), should he be paid a salary? If so, would teammates in revenue sports want to be paid equally, or in salaries stratified according to talent or value on the field? What would the athletes want in Division III, where athletic budgets keep rising without scholarships or substantial sports revenue? Would athletes seek more or less variance in admissions standards? Should non-athletes also have a voice, especially where involuntary student fees support more and more of college sports? Might some schools choose to specialize, paying players only in elite leagues for football, or lacrosse? In athletic councils, how much would high-revenue athletes value a simple thank you from the tennis or field-hockey players for the newly specified subsidies to their facilities?\n\nUniversity administrators, already besieged from all sides, do not want to even think about such questions. Most cringe at the thought of bargaining with athletes as a general manager does in professional sports, with untold effects on the budgets for coaches and every other sports item. \u201cI would not want to be part of it,\u201d North Carolina Athletic Director Dick Baddour told me flatly. After 44 years at UNC, he could scarcely contemplate a world without amateur rules. \u201cWe would have to think long and hard,\u201d Baddour added gravely, \u201cabout whether this university would continue those sports at all.\u201d\n\nI, too, once reflexively recoiled at the idea of paying college athletes and treating them like employees or professionals. It feels abhorrent\u2014but for reasons having to do more with sentiment than with practicality or law. Not just fans and university presidents but judges have often found cursory, non-statutory excuses to leave amateur traditions intact. \u201cEven in the increasingly commercial modern world,\u201d said a federal-court judge in Gaines v. NCAA in 1990, \u201cthis Court believes there is still validity to the Athenian concept of a complete education derived from fostering the full growth of both mind and body.\u201d The fact that \u201cthe NCAA has not distilled amateurism to its purest form,\u201d said the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1988, \u201cdoes not mean its attempts to maintain a mixture containing some amateur elements are unreasonable.\u201d\n\nBut one way or another, the smokescreen of amateurism may soon be swept away. For one thing, a victory by the plaintiffs in O\u2019Bannon\u2019s case would radically transform college sports. Colleges would likely have to either stop profiting from students or start paying them. The NCAA could also be forced to pay tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars in damages. If O\u2019Bannon and Vaccaro and company win, \u201cit will turn college sports on its ear,\u201d said Richard Lapchick, the president of the National Consortium for Academics and Sports, in a recent interview with The New York Times.\n\nThough the O\u2019Bannon case may take several years yet to reach resolution, developments on other fronts are chipping away at amateurism, and at the NCAA. This past summer, Sports Illustrated editorialized in favor of allowing college athletes to be paid by non-university sources without jeopardizing their eligibility. At a press conference last June, Steve Spurrier, the coach of the South Carolina Gamecocks football team (and the winner of the 1966 Heisman Trophy as a Florida Gator), proposed that coaches start paying players $300 a game out of their own pockets. The coaches at six other SEC schools (Alabama, Florida, Ole Miss, Mississippi State, LSU, and Tennessee) all endorsed Spurrier\u2019s proposal. And Mark Emmert, the NCAA president, recently conceded that big changes must come. \u201cThe integrity of collegiate athletics is seriously challenged today by rapidly growing pressures coming from many directions,\u201d Emmert said in July. \u201cWe have reached a point where incremental change is not sufficient to meet these challenges. I want us to act more aggressively and in a more comprehensive way than we have in the past. A few new tweaks of the rules won\u2019t get the job done.\u201d\n\nThreats to NCAA dominion also percolate in Congress. Aggrieved legislators have sponsored numerous bills. Senator Orrin Hatch, citing mistreatment of his Utah Utes, has called witnesses to discuss possible antitrust remedies for the Bowl Championship Series. Congressional committees have already held hearings critical of the NCAA\u2019s refusal to follow due process in disciplinary matters; other committees have explored a rise in football concussions. Last January, calls went up to investigate \u201cinformal\u201d football workouts at the University of Iowa just after the season-ending bowl games\u2014workouts so grueling that 41 of the 56 amateur student-athletes collapsed, and 13 were hospitalized with rhabdomyolysis, a life-threatening kidney condition often caused by excessive exercise.\n\nThe greatest threat to the viability of the NCAA may come from its member universities. Many experts believe that the churning instability within college football will drive the next major change. President Obama himself has endorsed the drumbeat cry for a national playoff in college football. This past spring, the Justice Department questioned the BCS about its adherence to antitrust standards. Jim Delany, the commissioner of the Big Ten, has estimated that a national playoff system could produce three or four times as much money as the existing bowl system does. If a significant band of football schools were to demonstrate that they could orchestrate a true national playoff, without the NCAA\u2019s assistance, the association would be terrified\u2014and with good reason. Because if the big sports colleges don\u2019t need the NCAA to administer a national playoff in football, then they don\u2019t need it to do so in basketball. In which case, they could cut out the middleman in March Madness and run the tournament themselves. Which would deprive the NCAA of close to $1 billion a year, more than 95 percent of its revenue. The organization would be reduced to a rule book without money\u2014an organization aspiring to enforce its rules but without the financial authority to enforce anything.\n\nThus the playoff dreamed of and hankered for by millions of football fans haunts the NCAA. \u201cThere will be some kind of playoff in college football, and it will not be run by the NCAA,\u201d says Todd Turner, a former athletic director in four conferences (Big East, ACC, SEC, and Pac-10). \u201cIf I\u2019m at the NCAA, I have to worry that the playoff group can get basketball to break away, too.\u201d\n\nThis danger helps explain why the NCAA steps gingerly in enforcements against powerful colleges. To alienate member colleges would be to jeopardize its own existence. Long gone are television bans and the \u201cdeath penalty\u201d sentences (commanding season-long shutdowns of offending teams) once meted out to Kentucky (1952), Southwestern Louisiana (1973), and Southern Methodist University (1987). Institutions receive mostly symbolic slaps nowadays. Real punishments fall heavily on players and on scapegoats like literacy tutors.\n\nA deeper reason explains why, in its predicament, the NCAA has no recourse to any principle or law that can justify amateurism. There is no such thing. Scholars and sportswriters yearn for grand juries to ferret out every forbidden bauble that reaches a college athlete, but the NCAA\u2019s ersatz courts can only masquerade as public authority. How could any statute impose amateur status on college athletes, or on anyone else? No legal definition of amateur exists, and any attempt to create one in enforceable law would expose its repulsive and unconstitutional nature\u2014a bill of attainder, stripping from college athletes the rights of American citizenship.\n\nFOR ALL OUR queasiness about what would happen if some athletes were to get paid, there is a successful precedent for the professionalization of an amateur sports system: the Olympics. For years, Walter Byers waged war with the NCAA\u2019s older and more powerful nemesis, the Amateur Athletic Union, which since 1894 had overseen U.S. Olympic athletes. Run in high-handed fashion, the AAU had infamously banned Jesse Owens for life in 1936\u2014weeks after his four heroic gold medals punctured the Nazi claim of Aryan supremacy\u2014because instead of using his sudden fame to tour and make money for the AAU at track meets across Europe, he came home early. In the early 1960s, the fights between the NCAA and the AAU over who should manage Olympic athletes become so bitter that President Kennedy called in General Douglas MacArthur to try to mediate a truce before the Tokyo Olympic Games.\n\nUltimately, Byers prevailed and effectively neutered the AAU. In November 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed the bipartisan Amateur Sports Act. Amateurism in the Olympics soon dissolved\u2014and the world did not end. Athletes, granted a 20 percent voting stake on every Olympic sport\u2019s governing body, tipped balances in the United States and then inexorably around the world. First in marathon races, then in tennis tournaments, players soon were allowed to accept prize money and keep their Olympic eligibility. Athletes profited from sponsorships and endorsements. The International Olympic Committee expunged the word amateur from its charter in 1986. Olympic officials, who had once disdained the NCAA for offering scholarships in exchange for athletic performance, came to welcome millionaire athletes from every quarter, while the NCAA still refused to let the pro Olympian Michael Phelps swim for his college team at Michigan.\n\nThis sweeping shift left the Olympic reputation intact, and perhaps improved. Only hardened romantics mourned the amateur code. \u201cHey, come on,\u201d said Anne Audain, a track-and-field star who once held the world record for the 5,000 meters. \u201cIt\u2019s like losing your virginity. You\u2019re a little misty for awhile, but then you realize, Wow, there\u2019s a whole new world out there!\u201d\n\nWithout logic or practicality or fairness to support amateurism, the NCAA\u2019s final retreat is to sentiment. The Knight Commission endorsed its heartfelt cry that to pay college athletes would be \u201can unacceptable surrender to despair.\u201d Many of the people I spoke with while reporting this article felt the same way. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay college players,\u201d said Wade Smith, a tough criminal lawyer and former star running back at North Carolina. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to do it. We\u2019d lose something precious.\u201d\n\n\u201cScholarship athletes are already paid,\u201d declared the Knight Commission members, \u201cin the most meaningful way poss-ible: with a free education.\u201d This evasion by prominent educators severed my last reluctant, emotional tie with imposed amateurism. I found it worse than self-serving. It echoes masters who once claimed that heavenly salvation would outweigh earthly injustice to slaves. In the era when our college sports first arose, colonial powers were turning the whole world upside down to define their own interests as all-inclusive and benevolent. Just so, the NCAA calls it heinous exploitation to pay college athletes a fair portion of what they earn.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/5184448", "artist_names": "T-Ski Valley", "full_title": "Big Stuff (Rap & Breaks) by\u00a0T-Ski\u00a0Valley", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/cc3c2a066fdc20dd303c02f9595c6f5e.300x304x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/cc3c2a066fdc20dd303c02f9595c6f5e.600x607x1.jpg", "id": 5184448, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 381464, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1579374872, "path": "/T-ski-valley-big-stuff-rap-and-breaks-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/T-ski-valley-big-stuff-rap-and-breaks-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1982, "month": 1, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "January 1, 1982", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jan. 1, 1982", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/cc3c2a066fdc20dd303c02f9595c6f5e.300x304x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/cc3c2a066fdc20dd303c02f9595c6f5e.600x607x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Big Stuff (Rap & Breaks)", "title_with_featured": "Big Stuff (Rap & Breaks)", "updated_by_human_at": 1579374993, "url": "https://genius.com/T-ski-valley-big-stuff-rap-and-breaks-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/1225841", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fab995a7fdc3c6ea21fd8846052176b1.300x300x1.jpg", "id": 1225841, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fab995a7fdc3c6ea21fd8846052176b1.300x300x1.jpg", "index_character": "t", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "T-Ski Valley", "slug": "T-ski-valley", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/T-ski-valley"}, "artist": "T-Ski Valley", "lyrics": "Big Stuff (Rap & Breaks) Lyrics[Intro]\nWell alright y'all, now it's time to get tough\nSo everybody say Mr. Big Stuff (Mr.\u2005Big\u2005Stuff!)\nMr. Big Stuff\u2005(Mr. Big Stuff!)\nHa ha ha\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell it's\u2005T-Ski and I'm back again\nJust to rock your mind down to the end\nI'm not a conductor, faster than lightning\nListen to my rhyme but don't start biting\nYou can dance with them, you can dance with us\nI'm gonna rock you, from dawn to dust\nBut if you want to dance but don't know how\nYou listen to my voice and let it move you around\nI got a MC voice that's always rockin'\nTo keep your fingers steady poppin'\nSo people, you get ready to move\nScream it out and say Grand Groove (Grand Groove!)\nGrand Groove!

Beneath the head of the hammock, a campstool. On the other side of the flagstaff, on the long garden seat, Captain Shotover is asleep, with ELLIE beside him, leaning affectionately against him on his right hand. On his left is a deck chair. Behind them in the gloom, Hesione is strolling about with MANGAN. It is a fine still night, moonless.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nWhat a lovely night! It seems made for us.\n\nHECTOR.\nThe night takes no interest in us. What are we to the night? [He sits down moodily in the deck chair].\n\nELLIE\n[dreamily, nestling against the captain]. Its beauty soaks into my nerves. In the night there is peace for the old and hope for the young.\nHECTOR.\nIs that remark your own?\n\nELLIE. No.\nOnly the last thing the captain said before he went to sleep.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nI'm not asleep.\n\nHECTOR.\nRandall is. Also Mr MAZZINI DUNN. MANGAN, too, probably.\n\nMANGAN.\nNo.\n\nHECTOR.\nOh, you are there. I thought Hesione would have sent you to bed by this time.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE\n[coming to the back of the garden seat, into the light, with MANGAN]. I think I shall. He keeps telling me he has a presentiment that he is going to die. I never met a man so greedy for sympathy.\n\nMANGAN\n[plaintively]. But I have a presentiment. I really have. And you wouldn't listen.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nI was listening for something else. There was a sort of splendid drumming in the sky. Did none of you hear it? It came from a distance and then died away.\nMANGAN.\nI tell you it was a train.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nAnd I tell you, Alf, there is no train at this hour. The last is nine forty-five.\n\nMANGAN.\nBut a goods train.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nNot on our little line. They tack a truck on to the passenger train. What can it have been, HECTOR?\n\nHECTOR.\nHeaven's threatening growl of disgust at us useless futile creatures. [Fiercely]. I tell you, one of two things must happen. Either out of that darkness some new creation will come to supplant us as we have supplanted the animals, or the heavens will fall in thunder and destroy us.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD \n[in a cool instructive manner, wallowing comfortably in her hammock]. We have not supplanted the animals, HECTOR. Why do you ask heaven to destroy this house, which could be made quite comfortable if Hesione had any notion of how to live? Don't you know what is wrong with it?\n\nHECTOR.\nWe are wrong with it. There is no sense in us. We are useless, dangerous, and ought to be abolished.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nNonsense! Hastings told me the very first day he came here, nearly twenty-four years ago, what is wrong with the house.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nWhat! The numskull said there was something wrong with my house!\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nI said Hastings said it; and he is not in the least a numskull.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nWhat's wrong with my house?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nJust what is wrong with a ship, papa. Wasn't it clever of Hastings to see that?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nThe man's a fool. There's nothing wrong with a ship.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nYes, there is.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nBut what is it? Don't be aggravating, Addy.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nGuess.\n\nHECTOR.\nDemons. Daughters of the witch of Zanzibar. Demons.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nNot a bit. I assure you, all this house needs to make it a sensible, healthy, pleasant house, with good appetites and sound sleep in it, is horses.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nHorses! What rubbish!\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nYes: horses. Why have we never been able to let this house? Because there are no proper stables. Go anywhere in England where there are natural, wholesome, contented, and really nice English people; and what do you always find? That the stables are the real centre of the household; and that if any visitor wants to play the piano the whole room has to be upset before it can be opened, there are so many things piled on it. I never lived until I learned to ride; and I shall never ride really well because I didn't begin as a child. There are only two classes in good society in England: the equestrian classes and the neurotic classes. It isn't mere convention: everybody can see that the people who hunt are the right people and the people who don't are the wrong ones.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nThere is some truth in this. My ship made a man of me; and a ship is the horse of the sea.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nExactly how Hastings explained your being a gentleman.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nNot bad for a numskull. Bring the man here with you next time: I must talk to him.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nWhy is Randall such an obvious rotter? He is well bred; he has been at a public school and a university; he has been in the Foreign Office; he knows the best people and has lived all his life among them. Why is he so unsatisfactory, so contemptible? Why can't he get a valet to stay with him longer than a few months? Just because he is too lazy and pleasure-loving to hunt and shoot. He strums the piano, and sketches, and runs after married women, and reads literary books and poems. He actually plays the flute; but I never let him bring it into my house. If he would only\u2014[she is interrupted by the melancholy strains of a flute coming from an open window above. She raises herself indignantly in the hammock]. Randall, you have not gone to bed. Have you been listening? [The flute replies pertly]. How vulgar! Go to bed instantly, Randall: how dare you? [The window is slammed down. She subsides]. How can anyone care for such a creature!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nAddy: do you think ELLIE ought to marry poor ALFRED merely for his money?\n\nMANGAN\n[much alarmed]. What's that? Mrs HUSHABYE, are my affairs to be discussed like this before everybody?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nI don't think Randall is listening now.\n\nMANGAN.\nEverybody is listening. It isn't right.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nBut in the dark, what does it matter? ELLIE doesn't mind. Do you, ELLIE?\n\nELLIE.\nNot in the least. What is your opinion, Lady Utterword? You have so much good sense.\n\nMANGAN.\nBut it isn't right. It\u2014[Mrs HUSHABYE puts her hand on his mouth]. Oh, very well.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nHow much money have you, Mr. MANGAN?\n\nMANGAN. Really\u2014\nNo: I can't stand this.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nNonsense, Mr MANGAN! It all turns on your income, doesn't it?\n\nMANGAN.\nWell, if you come to that, how much money has she?\n\nELLIE.\nNone.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nYou are answered, Mr MANGAN. And now, as you have made Miss DUNN throw her cards on the table, you cannot refuse to show your own.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nCome, Alf! out with it! How much?\n\nMANGAN\n[baited out of all prudence]. Well, if you want to know, I have no money and never had any.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nALFRED, you mustn't tell naughty stories.\n\nMANGAN.\nI'm not telling you stories. I'm telling you the raw truth.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nThen what do you live on, Mr MANGAN?\n\nMANGAN.\nTravelling expenses. And a trifle of commission.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nWhat more have any of us but travelling expenses for our life's journey?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nBut you have factories and capital and things?\n\nMANGAN.\nPeople think I have. People think I'm an industrial Napoleon. That's why Miss ELLIE wants to marry me. But I tell you I have nothing.\n\nELLIE.\nDo you mean that the factories are like Marcus's tigers? That they don't exist?\n\nMANGAN.\nThey exist all right enough. But they're not mine. They belong to syndicates and shareholders and all sorts of lazy good-for-nothing capitalists. I get money from such people to start the factories. I find people like Miss DUNN's father to work them, and keep a tight hand so as to make them pay. Of course I make them keep me going pretty well; but it's a dog's life; and I don't own anything.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nALFRED, ALFRED, you are making a poor mouth of it to get out of marrying ELLIE.\n\nMANGAN.\nI'm telling the truth about my money for the first time in my life; and it's the first time my word has ever been doubted.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nHow sad! Why don't you go in for politics, Mr MANGAN?\n\nMANGAN.\nGo in for politics! Where have you been living? I am in politics.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nI'm sure I beg your pardon. I never heard of you.\n\nMANGAN.\nLet me tell you, Lady Utterword, that the Prime Minister of this country asked me to join the Government without even going through the nonsense of an election, as the dictator of a great public department.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. As a Conservative or a Liberal?\n\nMANGAN.\nNo such nonsense. As a practical business man. [They all burst out laughing]. What are you all laughing at?\n\nMRS HUSHARYE.\nOh, ALFRED, ALFRED!\n\nELLIE.\nYou! who have to get my father to do everything for you!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nYou! who are afraid of your own workmen!\n\nHECTOR.\nYou! with whom three women have been playing cat and mouse all the evening!\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nYou must have given an immense sum to the party funds, Mr MANGAN.\n\nMANGAN.\nNot a penny out of my own pocket. The syndicate found the money: they knew how useful I should be to them in the Government.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nThis is most interesting and unexpected, Mr MANGAN. And what have your administrative achievements been, so far?\n\nMANGAN.\nAchievements? Well, I don't know what you call achievements; but I've jolly well put a stop to the games of the other fellows in the other departments. Every man of them thought he was going to save the country all by himself, and do me out of the credit and out of my chance of a title. I took good care that if they wouldn't let me do it they shouldn't do it themselves either. I may not know anything about my own machinery; but I know how to stick a ramrod into the other fellow's. And now they all look the biggest fools going.\n\nHECTOR.\nAnd in heaven's name, what do you look like?\n\nMANGAN. I look like the fellow that was too clever for all the others, don't I? If that isn't a triumph of practical business, what is?\n\nHECTOR.\nIs this England, or is it a madhouse?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nDo you expect to save the country, Mr MANGAN?\n\nMANGAN.\nWell, who else will? Will your Mr Randall save it?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nRandall the rotter! Certainly not.\n\nMANGAN.\nWill your brother-in-law save it with his moustache and his fine talk?\n\nHECTOR.\nYes, if they will let me.\n\nMANGAN\n[sneering]. Ah! Will they let you?\n\nHECTOR.\nNo. They prefer you.\n\nMANGAN. Very well then, as you're in a world where I'm appreciated and you're not, you'd best be civil to me, hadn't you? Who else is there but me?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nThere is Hastings. Get rid of your ridiculous sham democracy; and give Hastings the necessary powers, and a good supply of bamboo to bring the British native to his senses: he will save the country with the greatest ease.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nIt had better be lost. Any fool can govern with a stick in his hand. I could govern that way. It is not God's way. The man is a numskull.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nThe man is worth all of you rolled into one. What do you say, Miss DUNN?\n\nELLIE.\nI think my father would do very well if people did not put upon him and cheat him and despise him because he is so good.\n\nMANGAN\n[contemptuously]. I think I see MAZZINI DUNN getting into parliament or pushing his way into the Government. We've not come to that yet, thank God! What do you say, Mrs HUSHABYE?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nOh, I say it matters very little which of you governs the country so long as we govern you.\n\nHECTOR.\nWe? Who is we, pray?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nThe devil's granddaughters, dear. The lovely women.\n\nHECTOR\n[raising his hands as before]. Fall, I say, and deliver us from the lures of Satan!\n\nELLIE.\nThere seems to be nothing real in the world except my father and Shakespeare. Marcus's tigers are false; Mr MANGAN's millions are false; there is nothing really strong and true about Hesione but her beautiful black hair; and Lady Utterword's is too pretty to be real. The one thing that was left to me was the Captain's seventh degree of concentration; and that turns out to be\u2014\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nRum.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD\n[placidly]. A good deal of my hair is quite genuine. The Duchess of Dithering offered me fifty guineas for this [touching her forehead] under the impression that it was a transformation; but it is all natural except the color.\n\nMANGAN\n[wildly]. Look here: I'm going to take off all my clothes [he begins tearing off his coat].\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\n[in consternation] { Mr. MANGAN!\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER\n{ What's that?\n\nHECTOR.\n{ Ha! Ha! Do. Do.\n\nELLIE\n{ Please don't.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE\n[catching his arm and stopping him]. ALFRED, for shame! Are you mad?\n\nMANGAN.\nShame! What shame is there in this house? Let's all strip stark naked. We may as well do the thing thoroughly when we're about it. We've stripped ourselves morally naked: well, let us strip ourselves physically naked as well, and see how we like it. I tell you I can't bear this. I was brought up to be respectable. I don't mind the women dyeing their hair and the men drinking: it's human nature. But it's not human nature to tell everybody about it. Every time one of you opens your mouth I go like this [he cowers as if to avoid a missile], afraid of what will come next. How are we to have any self-respect if we don't keep it up that we're better than we really are?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nI quite sympathize with you, Mr MANGAN. I have been through it all; and I know by experience that men and women are delicate plants and must be cultivated under glass. Our family habit of throwing stones in all directions and letting the air in is not only unbearably rude, but positively dangerous. Still, there is no use catching physical colds as well as moral ones; so please keep your clothes on.\n\nMANGAN.\nI'll do as I like: not what you tell me. Am I a child or a grown man? I won't stand this mothering tyranny. I'll go back to the city, where I'm respected and made much of.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nGoodbye, Alf. Think of us sometimes in the city. Think of ELLIE's youth!\n\nELLIE.\nThink of Hesione's eyes and hair!\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nThink of this garden in which you are not a dog barking to keep the truth out!\n\nHECTOR.\nThink of Lady Utterword's beauty! her good sense! her style!\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nFlatterer. Think, Mr. MANGAN, whether you can really do any better for yourself elsewhere: that is the essential point, isn't it?\n\nMANGAN\n[surrendering]. All right: all right. I'm done. Have it your own way. Only let me alone. I don't know whether I'm on my head or my heels when you all start on me like this. I'll stay. I'll marry her. I'll do anything for a quiet life. Are you satisfied now?\n\nELLIE. No.\nI never really intended to make you marry me, Mr MANGAN. Never in the depths of my soul. I only wanted to feel my strength: to know that you could not escape if I chose to take you.\n\nMANGAN\n[indignantly]. What! Do you mean to say you are going to throw me over after my acting so handsome?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nI should not be too hasty, Miss DUNN. You can throw Mr MANGAN over at any time up to the last moment. Very few men in his position go bankrupt. You can live very comfortably on his reputation for immense wealth.\n\nELLIE.\nI cannot commit bigamy, Lady Utterword.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\n{ Bigamy! Whatever on earth are you talking about, ELLIE?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD\n[exclaiming altogether] { Bigamy! What do you mean, Miss DUNN?\n\nMANGAN\n{ Bigamy! Do you mean to say you're married already?\n\nHECTOR\n{ Bigamy! This is some enigma.\n\nELLIE.\nOnly half an hour ago I became Captain Shotover's white wife.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nELLIE! What nonsense! Where?\n\nELLIE.\nIn heaven, where all true marriages are made.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nReally, Miss DUNN! Really, papa!\n\nMANGAN.\nHe told me I was too old! And him a mummy!\n\nHECTOR\n[quoting Shelley].\n\n\"Their altar the grassy earth outspreads\nAnd their priest the muttering wind.\"\n\nELLIE.\nYes: I, ELLIE DUNN, give my broken heart and my strong sound soul to its natural captain, my spiritual husband and second father.\nShe draws the captain's arm through hers, and pats his hand. The captain remains fast asleep.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nOh, that's very clever of you, pettikins. Very clever. ALFRED, you could never have lived up to ELLIE. You must be content with a little share of me.\n\nMANGAN\n[snifflng and wiping his eyes]. It isn't kind\u2014[his emotion chokes him].\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nYou are well out of it, Mr MANGAN. Miss DUNN is the most conceited young woman I have met since I came back to England.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nOh, ELLIE isn't conceited. Are you, pettikins?\n\nELLIE.\nI know my strength now, Hesione.\n\nMANGAN.\nBrazen, I call you. Brazen.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nTut, tut, ALFRED: don't be rude. Don't you feel how lovely this marriage night is, made in heaven? Aren't you happy, you and HECTOR? Open your eyes: Addy and ELLIE look beautiful enough to please the most fastidious man: we live and love and have not a care in the world. We women have managed all that for you. Why in the name of common sense do you go on as if you were two miserable wretches?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nI tell you happiness is no good. You can be happy when you are only half alive. I am happier now I am half dead than ever I was in my prime. But there is no blessing on my happiness.\n\nELLIE\n[her face lighting up]. Life with a blessing! that is what I want. Now I know the real reason why I couldn't marry Mr MANGAN: there would be no blessing on our marriage. There is a blessing on my broken heart. There is a blessing on your beauty, Hesione. There is a blessing on your father's spirit. Even on the lies of Marcus there is a blessing; but on Mr MANGAN's money there is none.\n\nMANGAN.\nI don't understand a word of that.\n\nELLIE.\nNeither do I. But I know it means something.\n\nMANGAN.\nDon't say there was any difficulty about the blessing. I was ready to get a bishop to marry us.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nIsn't he a fool, pettikins?\n\nHECTOR\n[fiercely]. Do not scorn the man. We are all fools.\nMAZZINI, in pyjamas and a richly colored silk dressing gown, comes from the house, on Lady Utterword's side.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nOh! here comes the only man who ever resisted me. What's the matter, Mr DUNN? Is the house on fire?\n\nMAZZINI.\nOh, no: nothing's the matter: but really it's impossible to go to sleep with such an interesting conversation going on under one's window, and on such a beautiful night too. I just had to come down and join you all. What has it all been about?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nOh, wonderful things, soldier of freedom.\n\nHECTOR.\nFor example, MANGAN, as a practical business man, has tried to undress himself and has failed ignominiously; whilst you, as an idealist, have succeeded brilliantly.\n\nMAZZINI.\nI hope you don't mind my being like this, Mrs HUSHABYE. [He sits down on the campstool].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nOn the contrary, I could wish you always like that.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nYour daughter's match is off, Mr DUNN. It seems that Mr MANGAN, whom we all supposed to be a man of property, owns absolutely nothing.\n\nMAZZINI.\nWell, of course I knew that, Lady Utterword. But if people believe in him and are always giving him money, whereas they don't believe in me and never give me any, how can I ask poor ELLIE to depend on what I can do for her?\n\nMANGAN.\nDon't you run away with this idea that I have nothing. I\u2014\n\nHECTOR.\nOh, don't explain. We understand. You have a couple of thousand pounds in exchequer bills, 50,000 shares worth tenpence a dozen, and half a dozen tabloids of cyanide of potassium to poison yourself with when you are found out. That's the reality of your millions.\n\nMAZZINI.\nOh no, no, no. He is quite honest: the businesses are genuine and perfectly legal.\n\nHECTOR\n[disgusted]. Yah! Not even a great swindler!\n\nMANGAN.\nSo you think. But I've been too many for some honest men, for all that.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nThere is no pleasing you, Mr MANGAN. You are determined to be neither rich nor poor, honest nor dishonest.\n\nMANGAN.\nThere you go again. Ever since I came into this silly house I have been made to look like a fool, though I'm as good a man in this house as in the city.\n\nELLIE\n[musically]. Yes: this silly house, this strangely happy house, this agonizing house, this house without foundations. I shall call it Heartbreak House.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nStop, ELLIE; or I shall howl like an animal.\n\nMANGAN\n[breaks into a low snivelling]!!!\n\nMRS HUSAHBYE.\nThere! you have set ALFRED off.\n\nELLIE.\nI like him best when he is howling.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nSilence! [MANGAN subsides into silence]. I say, let the heart break in silence.\n\nHECTOR.\nDo you accept that name for your house?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nIt is not my house: it is only my kennel.\n\nHECTOR.\nWe have been too long here. We do not live in this house: we haunt it.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD\n[heart torn]. It is dreadful to think how you have been here all these years while I have gone round the world. I escaped young; but it has drawn me back. It wants to break my heart too. But it shan't. I have left you and it behind. It was silly of me to come back. I felt sentimental about papa and Hesione and the old place. I felt them calling to me.\n\nMAZZINI.\nBut what a very natural and kindly and charming human feeling, Lady Utterword!\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nSo I thought, Mr DUNN. But I know now that it was only the last of my influenza. I found that I was not remembered and not wanted.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nYou left because you did not want us. Was there no heartbreak in that for your father? You tore yourself up by the roots; and the ground healed up and brought forth fresh plants and forgot you. What right had you to come back and probe old wounds?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nYou were a complete stranger to me at first, Addy; but now I feel as if you had never been away.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nThank you, Hesione; but the influenza is quite cured. The place may be Heartbreak House to you, Miss DUNN, and to this gentleman from the city who seems to have so little self-control; but to me it is only a very ill-regulated and rather untidy villa without any stables.\n\nHECTOR.\nInhabited by\u2014?\n\nELLIE.\nA crazy old sea captain and a young singer who adores him.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nA sluttish female, trying to stave off a double chin and an elderly spread, vainly wooing a born soldier of freedom.\n\nMAZZINI.\nOh, really, Mrs HUSHABYE\u2014\n\nMANGAN.\nA member of His Majesty's Government that everybody sets down as a nincompoop: don't forget him, Lady Utterword.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nAnd a very fascinating gentleman whose chief occupation is to be married to my sister.\n\nHECTOR.\nAll heartbroken imbeciles.\n\nMAZZINI.\nOh no. Surely, if I may say so, rather a favorable specimen of what is best in our English culture. You are very charming people, most advanced, unprejudiced, frank, humane, unconventional, democratic, free-thinking, and everything that is delightful to thoughtful people.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nYou do us proud, MAZZINI.\n\nMAZZINI.\nI am not flattering, really. Where else could I feel perfectly at ease in my pyjamas? I sometimes dream that I am in very distinguished society, and suddenly I have nothing on but my pyjamas! Sometimes I haven't even pyjamas. And I always feel overwhelmed with confusion. But here, I don't mind in the least: it seems quite natural.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nAn infallible sign that you are now not in really distinguished society, Mr DUNN. If you were in my house, you would feel embarrassed.\n\nMAZZINI.\nI shall take particular care to keep out of your house, Lady Utterword.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nYou will be quite wrong, Mr DUNN. I should make you very comfortable; and you would not have the trouble and anxiety of wondering whether you should wear your purple and gold or your green and crimson dressing-gown at dinner. You complicate life instead of simplifying it by doing these ridiculous things.\n\nELLIE.\nYour house is not Heartbreak House: is it, Lady Utterword?\n\nHECTOR.\nYet she breaks hearts, easy as her house is. That poor devil upstairs with his flute howls when she twists his heart, just as MANGAN howls when my wife twists his.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nThat is because Randall has nothing to do but have his heart broken. It is a change from having his head shampooed. Catch anyone breaking Hastings' heart!\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nThe numskull wins, after all.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nI shall go back to my numskull with the greatest satisfaction when I am tired of you all, clever as you are.\n\nMANGAN\n[huffily]. I never set up to be clever.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nI forgot you, Mr MANGAN.\n\nMANGAN.\nWell, I don't see that quite, either.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nYou may not be clever, Mr MANGAN; but you are successful.\n\nMANGAN.\nBut I don't want to be regarded merely as a successful man. I have an imagination like anyone else. I have a presentiment.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nOh, you are impossible, ALFRED. Here I am devoting myself to you; and you think of nothing but your ridiculous presentiment. You bore me. Come and talk poetry to me under the stars. [She drags him away into the darkness].\n\nMANGAN\n[tearfully, as he disappears]. Yes: it's all very well to make fun of me; but if you only knew\u2014\n\nHECTOR\n\n[impatiently]. How is all this going to end?\n\nMAZZINI.\nIt won't end, Mr HUSHABYE. Life doesn't end: it goes on.\n\nELLIE.\nOh, it can't go on forever. I'm always expecting something. I don't know what it is; but life must come to a point sometime.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nThe point for a young woman of your age is a baby.\n\nHECTOR.\nYes, but, damn it, I have the same feeling; and I can't have a baby.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nBy deputy, HECTOR.\n\nHECTOR.\nBut I have children. All that is over and done with for me: and yet I too feel that this can't last. We sit here talking, and leave everything to MANGAN and to chance and to the devil. Think of the powers of destruction that MANGAN and his mutual admiration gang wield! It's madness: it's like giving a torpedo to a badly brought up child to play at earthquakes with.\n\nMAZZINI.\nI know. I used often to think about that when I was young.\n\nHECTOR.\nThink! What's the good of thinking about it? Why didn't you do something?\n\nMAZZINI.\nBut I did. I joined societies and made speeches and wrote pamphlets. That was all I could do. But, you know, though the people in the societies thought they knew more than MANGAN, most of them wouldn't have joined if they had known as much. You see they had never had any money to handle or any men to manage. Every year I expected a revolution, or some frightful smash-up: it seemed impossible that we could blunder and muddle on any longer. But nothing happened, except, of course, the usual poverty and crime and drink that we are used to. Nothing ever does happen. It's amazing how well we get along, all things considered.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nPerhaps somebody cleverer than you and Mr MANGAN was at work all the time.\n\nMAZZINI.\nPerhaps so. Though I was brought up not to believe in anything, I often feel that there is a great deal to be said for the theory of an over-ruling Providence, after all.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nProvidence! I meant Hastings.\n\nMAZZINI.\nOh, I beg your pardon, Lady Utterword.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nEvery drunken skipper trusts to Providence. But one of the ways of Providence with drunken skippers is to run them on the rocks.\n\nMAZZINI.\nVery true, no doubt, at sea. But in politics, I assure you, they only run into jellyfish. Nothing happens.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nAt sea nothing happens to the sea. Nothing happens to the sky. The sun comes up from the east and goes down to the west. The moon grows from a sickle to an arc lamp, and comes later and later until she is lost in the light as other things are lost in the darkness. After the typhoon, the flying-fish glitter in the sunshine like birds. It's amazing how they get along, all things considered. Nothing happens, except something not worth mentioning.\n\nELLIE.\nWhat is that, O Captain, O my captain?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER\n[savagely]. Nothing but the smash of the drunken skipper's ship on the rocks, the splintering of her rotten timbers, the tearing of her rusty plates, the drowning of the crew like rats in a trap.\n\nELLIE.\nMoral: don't take rum.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER\n[vehemently]. That is a lie, child. Let a man drink ten barrels of rum a day, he is not a drunken skipper until he is a drifting skipper. Whilst he can lay his course and stand on his bridge and steer it, he is no drunkard. It is the man who lies drinking in his bunk and trusts to Providence that I call the drunken skipper, though he drank nothing but the waters of the River Jordan.\n\nELLIE.\nSplendid! And you haven't had a drop for an hour. You see you don't need it: your own spirit is not dead.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nEchoes: nothing but echoes. The last shot was fired years ago.\n\nHECTOR.\nAnd this ship that we are all in? This soul's prison we call England?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. The captain is in his bunk, drinking bottled ditch-water; and the crew is gambling in the forecastle. She will strike and sink and split. Do you think the laws of God will be suspended in favor of England because you were born in it?\n\nHECTOR.\nWell, I don't mean to be drowned like a rat in a trap. I still have the will to live. What am I to do?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nDo? Nothing simpler. Learn your business as an Englishman.\n\nHECTOR.\nAnd what may my business as an Englishman be, pray?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nNavigation. Learn it and live; or leave it and be damned.\n\nELLIE.\nQuiet, quiet: you'll tire yourself.\n\nMAZZINI. I thought all that once, Captain; but I assure you nothing will happen.\nA dull dista\nnt explosion is heard.\n\nHECTOR\n[starting up]. What was that?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nSomething happening [he blows his whistle]. Breakers ahead!\nThe light goes out.\n\nHECTOR\n[furiously]. Who put that light out? Who dared put that light out?\n\nNURSE GUINNESS\n[running in from the house to the middle of the esplanade]. I did, sir. The police have telephoned to say we'll be summoned if we don't put that light out: it can be seen for miles.\n\nHECTOR.\nIt shall be seen for a hundred miles [he dashes into the house].\n\nNURSE GUINNESS.\nThe Rectory is nothing but a heap of bricks, they say. Unless we can give the Rector a bed he has nowhere to lay his head this night.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nThe Church is on the rocks, breaking up. I told him it would unless it headed for God's open sea.\n\nNURSE GUINNESS.\nAnd you are all to go down to the cellars.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nGo there yourself, you and all the crew. Batten down the hatches.\n\nNURSE GUINNESS.\nAnd hide beside the coward I married! I'll go on the roof first. [The lamp lights up again]. There! Mr HUSHABYE's turned it on again.\n\nTHE BURGLAR\n[hurrying in and appealing to Nurse GUINNESS]. Here: where's the way to that gravel pit? The boot-boy says there's a cave in the gravel pit. Them cellars is no use. Where's the gravel pit, Captain?\n\nNURSE GUINNESS.\nGo straight on past the flagstaff until you fall into it and break your dirty neck. [She pushes him contemptuously towards the flagstaff, and herself goes to the foot of the hammock and waits there, as it were by ARIADNE's cradle].\nAnother and louder explosion is heard. The burglar stops and stands trembling.\n\nELLIE\n[rising]. That was nearer.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nThe next one will get us. [He rises]. Stand by, all hands, for judgment.\n\nTHE BURGLAR.\nOh my Lordy God! [He rushes away frantically past the flagstaff into the gloom].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE\n[emerging panting from the darkness]. Who was that running away? [She comes to ELLIE]. Did you hear the explosions? And the sound in the sky: it's splendid: it's like an orchestra: it's like Beethoven.\n\nELLIE.\nBy thunder, Hesione: it is Beethoven.\nShe and Hesione throw themselves into one another's arms in wild excitement. The light increases.\n\nMAZZINI\n[anxiously]. The light is getting brighter.\nNURSE GUINNESS\n[looking up at the house]. It's Mr HUSHABYE turning on all the lights in the house and tearing down the curtains.\n\nRANDALL\n[rushing in in his pyjamas, distractedly waving a flute]. ARIADNE, my soul, my precious, go down to the cellars: I beg and implore you, go down to the cellars!\n\nLADY UTTERWORD\n[quite composed in her hammock]. The governor's wife in the cellars with the servants! Really, Randall!\n\nRANDALL.\nBut what shall I do if you are killed?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nYou will probably be killed, too, Randall. Now play your flute to show that you are not afraid; and be good. Play us \"Keep the home fires burning.\"\n\nNURSE GUINNESS\n[grimly]. THEY'LL keep the home fires burning for us: them up there.\n\nRANDALL\n[having tried to play]. My lips are trembling. I can't get a sound.\n\nMAZZINI.\nI hope poor MANGAN is safe.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nHe is hiding in the cave in the gravel pit.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nMy dynamite drew him there. It is the hand of God.\n\nHECTOR\n[returning from the house and striding across to his former place]. There is not half light enough. We should be blazing to the skies.\n\nELLIE\n[tense with excitement]. Set fire to the house, Marcus.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nMy house! No.\n\nHECTOR.\nI thought of that; but it would not be ready in time.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nThe judgment has come. Courage will not save you; but it will show that your souls are still live.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nSh-sh! Listen: do you hear it now? It's magnificent.\nThey all turn away from the house and look up, listening.\n\nHECTOR\n[gravely]. Miss DUNN, you can do no good here. We of this house are only moths flying into the candle. You had better go down to the cellar.\n\nELLIE\n[scornfully]. I don't think.\n\nMAZZINI. ELLIE, dear, there is no disgrace in going to the cellar. An officer would order his soldiers to take cover. Mr HUSHABYE is behaving like an amateur. MANGAN and the burglar are acting very sensibly; and it is they who will survive.\n\nELLIE.\nLet them. I shall behave like an amateur. But why should you run any risk?\n\nMAZZINI.\nThink of the risk those poor fellows up there are running!\n\nNURSE GUINNESS.\nThink of them, indeed, the murdering blackguards! What next?\nA terrific explosion shakes the earth. They reel back into their seats, or clutch the nearest support. They hear the falling of the shattered glass from the windows.\n\nMAZZINI.\nIs anyone hurt?\n\nHECTOR.\nWhere did it fall?\n\nNURSE GUINNESS\n[in hideous triumph]. Right in the gravel pit: I seen it. Serve un right! I seen it [she runs away towards the gravel pit, laughing harshly].\n\nHECTOR.\nOne husband gone.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nThirty pounds of good dynamite wasted.\n\nMAZZINI.\nOh, poor MANGAN!\n\nHECTOR.\nAre you immortal that you need pity him? Our turn next.\nThey wait in silence and intense expectation. Hesione and ELLIE hold each other's hand tight.\nA distant explosion is heard.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE\n[relaxing her grip]. Oh! they have passed us.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\nThe danger is over, Randall. Go to bed.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER.\nTurn in, all hands. The ship is safe. [He sits down and goes asleep].\n\nELLIE\n[disappointedly]. Safe!\n\nHECTOR\n[disgustedly]. Yes, safe. And how damnably dull the world has become again suddenly! [he sits down].\n\nMAZZINI\n[sitting down]. I was quite wrong, after all. It is we who have survived; and MANGAN and the burglar\u2014\n\nHECTOR.\n\u2014the two burglars\u2014\n\nLADY UTTERWORD.\n\u2014the two practical men of business\u2014\n\nMAZZINI.\n\u2014both gone. And the poor clergyman will have to get a new house.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE.\nBut what a glorious experience! I hope they'll come again tomorrow night.\n\nELLIE\n[radiant at the prospect]. Oh, I hope so.\nRandall at last succeeds in keeping the home fires burning on his flute.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/4628730", "artist_names": "Jesse Jo

(shoe) in\nAnd guess who doin' the bap, bap, bap ties and the gat risin'\nThey all come my way with detention\nEnd up gettin' the same sentence\nStart with I, chalk lines, mad times, I show 'em the ropes\nNow this is where Chaz ties in (chastising)\nIf I don't put Chaz man in a casket\nShiiit, you gon' be nappin' on a mattress\nWith a permanent address at the hospital\nThe sight gon' be the saddest, it's tragic\nImagine havin' to see ya kid try to play peek a boo witchu in ICU (and I see you)\nI can see more wrong (moron) when I see you\nGod got a devilish sense of humor, that's probably true\nI mean his test gotta be a few of the funniest jokes\nLike, \"Don't y'all think it's hilarious that after you just decided to stop eatin' meat, that man put you right in front of the

(chastity) belts\nThis a case of mistaken identity, ARP givin' me the wrong person\nFor him remember, these jail bars wasn't meant for\nSo in a sense (innocence) it'll be, now you can't bail 'cause you don't know the shit you in for\nThis your day to loss (data loss), backup everything like when you send off your phone the Sprint store\n'Cause if boy can't walkie what he talkie\nWell that's the

Senator Is But a Man\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The light of the cheerful fire shone on the rug and carpet of a cosey parlor, and glittered on the sides of the tea-cups and well-brightened tea-pot, as Senator Bird was drawing off his boots, preparatory to inserting his feet in a pair of new handsome slippers, which his wife had been working for him while away on his senatorial tour. Mrs. Bird, looking the very picture of delight, was superintending the arrangements of the table, ever and anon mingling admonitory remarks to a number of frolicsome juveniles, who were effervescing in all those modes of untold gambol and mischief that have astonished mothers ever since the flood.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tom, let the door-knob alone,\u2014there's a man! Mary! Mary! don't pull the cat's tail,\u2014poor pussy! Jim, you mustn't climb on that table,\u2014no, no!\u2014You don't know, my dear, what a surprise it is to us all, to see you here tonight!\" said she, at last, when she found a space to say something to her husband.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, yes, I thought I'd just make a run down, spend the night, and have a little comfort at home. I'm tired to death, and my head aches!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Bird cast a glance at a camphor-bottle, which stood in the half-open closet, and appeared to meditate an approach to it, but her husband interposed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, no, Mary, no doctoring! a cup of your good hot tea, and some of our good home living, is what I want. It's a tiresome business, this legislating!\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the senator smiled, as if he rather liked the idea of considering himself a sacrifice to his country.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well,\" said his wife, after the business of the tea-table was getting rather slack, \"and what have they been doing in the Senate?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, it was a very unusual thing for gentle little Mrs. Bird ever to trouble her head with what was going on in the house of the state, very wisely considering that she had enough to do to mind her own. Mr. Bird, therefore, opened his eyes in surprise, and said,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Not very much of importance.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well; but is it true that they have been passing a law forbidding people to give meat and drink to those poor colored folks that come along? I heard they were talking of some such law, but I didn't think any Christian legislature would pass it!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, Mary, you are getting to be a politician, all at once.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, nonsense! I wouldn't give a fig for all your politics, generally, but I think this is something downright cruel and unchristian. I hope, my dear, no such law has been passed.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There has been a law passed forbidding people to help off the slaves that come over from Kentucky, my dear; so much of that thing has been done by these reckless Abolitionists, that our brethren in Kentucky are very strongly excited, and it seems necessary, and no more than Christian and kind, that something should be done by our state to quiet the excitement.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And what is the law? It don't forbid us to shelter those poor creatures a night, does it, and to give 'em something comfortable to eat, and a few old clothes, and send them quietly about their business?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, yes, my dear; that would be aiding and abetting, you know.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Bird was a timid, blushing little woman, of about four feet in height, and with mild blue eyes, and a peach-blow complexion, and the gentlest, sweetest voice in the world;\u2014as for courage, a moderate-sized cock-turkey had been known to put her to rout at the very first gobble, and a stout house-dog, of moderate capacity, would bring her into subjection merely by a show of his teeth. Her husband and children were her entire world, and in these she ruled more by entreaty and persuasion than by command or argument. There was only one thing that was capable of arousing her, and that provocation came in on the side of her unusually gentle and sympathetic nature;\u2014anything in the shape of cruelty would throw her into a passion, which was the more alarming and inexplicable in proportion to the general softness of her nature. Generally the most indulgent and easy to be entreated of all mothers, still her boys had a very reverent remembrance of a most vehement chastisement she once bestowed on them, because she found them leagued with several graceless boys of the neighborhood, stoning a defenceless kitten.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'll tell you what,\" Master Bill used to say, \"I was scared that time. Mother came at me so that I thought she was crazy, and I was whipped and tumbled off to bed, without any supper, before I could get over wondering what had come about; and, after that, I heard mother crying outside the door, which made me feel worse than all the rest. I'll tell you what,\" he'd say, \"we boys never stoned another kitten!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the present occasion, Mrs. Bird rose quickly, with very red cheeks, which quite improved her general appearance, and walked up to her husband, with quite a resolute air, and said, in a determined tone,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, John, I want to know if you think such a law as that is right and Christian?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You won't shoot me, now, Mary, if I say I do!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I never could have thought it of you, John; you didn't vote for it?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Even so, my fair politician.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You ought to be ashamed, John! Poor, homeless, houseless creatures! It's a shameful, wicked, abominable law, and I'll break it, for one, the first time I get a chance; and I hope I shall have a chance, I do! Things have got to a pretty pass, if a woman can't give a warm supper and a bed to poor, starving creatures, just because they are slaves, and have been abused and oppressed all their lives, poor things!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, Mary, just listen to me. Your feelings are all quite right, dear, and interesting, and I love you for them; but, then, dear, we mustn't suffer our feelings to run away with our judgment; you must consider it's a matter of private feeling,\u2014there are great public interests involved,\u2014there is such a state of public agitation rising, that we must put aside our private feelings.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, John, I don't know anything about politics, but I can read my Bible; and there I see that I must feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and comfort the desolate; and that Bible I mean to follow.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But in cases where your doing so would involve a great public evil\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Obeying God never brings on public evils. I know it can't. It's always safest, all round, to do as He bids us.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, listen to me, Mary, and I can state to you a very clear argument, to show\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"O, nonsense, John! you can talk all night, but you wouldn't do it. I put it to you, John,\u2014would you now turn away a poor, shivering, hungry creature from your door, because he was a runaway? Would you, now?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, if the truth must be told, our senator had the misfortune to be a man who had a particularly humane and accessible nature, and turning away anybody that was in trouble never had been his forte; and what was worse for him in this particular pinch of the argument was, that his wife knew it, and, of course was making an assault on rather an indefensible point. So he had recourse to the usual means of gaining time for such cases made and provided; he said \"ahem,\" and coughed several times, took out his pocket-handkerchief, and began to wipe his glasses. Mrs. Bird, seeing the defenceless condition of the enemy's territory, had no more conscience than to push her advantage.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I should like to see you doing that, John\u2014I really should! Turning a woman out of doors in a snowstorm, for instance; or may be you'd take her up and put her in jail, wouldn't you? You would make a great hand at that!\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Of course, it would be a very painful duty,\" began Mr. Bird, in a moderate tone.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Duty, John! don't use that word! You know it isn't a duty\u2014it can't be a duty! If folks want to keep their slaves from running away, let 'em treat 'em well,\u2014that's my doctrine. If I had slaves (as I hope I never shall have), I'd risk their wanting to run away from me, or you either, John. I tell you folks don't run away when they are happy; and when they do run, poor creatures! they suffer enough with cold and hunger and fear, without everybody's turning against them; and, law or no law, I never will, so help me God!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Mary! Mary! My dear, let me reason with you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I hate reasoning, John,\u2014especially reasoning on such subjects. There's a way you political folks have of coming round and round a plain right thing; and you don't believe in it yourselves, when it comes to practice. I know you well enough, John. You don't believe it's right any more than I do; and you wouldn't do it any sooner than I.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this critical juncture, old Cudjoe, the black man-of-all-work, put his head in at the door, and wished \"Missis would come into the kitchen;\" and our senator, tolerably relieved, looked after his little wife with a whimsical mixture of amusement and vexation, and, seating himself in the arm-chair, began to read the papers.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After a moment, his wife's voice was heard at the door, in a quick, earnest tone,\u2014\"John! John! I do wish you'd come here, a moment.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He laid down his paper, and went into the kitchen, and started, quite amazed at the sight that presented itself:\u2014A young and slender woman, with garments torn and frozen, with one shoe gone, and the stocking torn away from the cut and bleeding foot, was laid back in a deadly swoon upon two chairs. There was the impress of the despised race on her face, yet none could help feeling its mournful and pathetic beauty, while its stony sharpness, its cold, fixed, deathly aspect, struck a solemn chill over him. He drew his breath short, and stood in silence. His wife, and their only colored domestic, old Aunt Dinah, were busily engaged in restorative measures; while old Cudjoe had got the boy on his knee, and was busy pulling off his shoes and stockings, and chafing his little cold feet.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Sure, now, if she an't a sight to behold!\" said old Dinah, compassionately; \"'pears like 't was the heat that made her faint. She was tol'able peart when she cum in, and asked if she couldn't warm herself here a spell; and I was just a-askin' her where she cum from, and she fainted right down. Never done much hard work, guess, by the looks of her hands.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Poor creature!\" said Mrs. Bird, compassionately, as the woman slowly unclosed her large, dark eyes, and looked vacantly at her. Suddenly an expression of agony crossed her face, and she sprang up, saying, \"O, my Harry! Have they got him?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The boy, at this, jumped from Cudjoe's knee, and running to her side put up his arms. \"O, he's here! he's here!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"O, ma'am!\" said she, wildly, to Mrs. Bird, \"do protect us! don't let them get him!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Nobody shall hurt you here, poor woman,\" said Mrs. Bird, encouragingly. \"You are safe; don't be afraid.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"God bless you!\" said the woman, covering her face and sobbing; while the little boy, seeing her crying, tried to get into her lap.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With many gentle and womanly offices, which none knew better how to render than Mrs. Bird, the poor woman was, in time, rendered more calm. A temporary bed was provided for her on the settle, near the fire; and, after a short time, she fell into a heavy slumber, with the child, who seemed no less weary, soundly sleeping on her arm; for the mother resisted, with nervous anxiety, the kindest attempts to take him from her; and, even in sleep, her arm encircled him with an unrelaxing clasp, as if she could not even then be beguiled of her vigilant hold.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. and Mrs. Bird had gone back to the parlor, where, strange as it may appear, no reference was made, on either side, to the preceding conversation; but Mrs. Bird busied herself with her knitting-work, and Mr. Bird pretended to be reading the paper.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I wonder who and what she is!\" said Mr. Bird, at last, as he laid it down.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"When she wakes up and feels a little rested, we will see,\" said Mrs. Bird.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I say, wife!\" said Mr. Bird after musing in silence over his newspaper.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, dear!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She couldn't wear one of your gowns, could she, by any letting down, or such matter? She seems to be rather larger than you are.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A quite perceptible smile glimmered on Mrs. Bird's face, as she answered, \"We'll see.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another pause, and Mr. Bird again broke out,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I say, wife!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well! What now?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, there's that old bombazin cloak, that you keep on purpose to put over me when I take my afternoon's nap; you might as well give her that,\u2014she needs clothes.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this instant, Dinah looked in to say that the woman was awake, and wanted to see Missis.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. and Mrs. Bird went into the kitchen, followed by the two eldest boys, the smaller fry having, by this time, been safely disposed of in bed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The woman was now sitting up on the settle, by the fire. She was looking steadily into the blaze, with a calm, heart-broken expression, very different from her former agitated wildness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you want me?\" said Mrs. Bird, in gentle tones. \"I hope you feel better now, poor woman!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A long-drawn, shivering sigh was the only answer; but she lifted her dark eyes, and fixed them on her with such a forlorn and imploring expression, that the tears came into the little woman's eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You needn't be afraid of anything; we are friends here, poor woman! Tell me where you came from, and what you want,\" said she.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I came from Kentucky,\" said the woman.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"When?\" said Mr. Bird, taking up the interogatory.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tonight.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How did you come?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I crossed on the ice.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Crossed on the ice!\" said every one present.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes,\" said the woman, slowly, \"I did. God helping me, I crossed on the ice; for they were behind me\u2014right behind\u2014and there was no other way!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Law, Missis,\" said Cudjoe, \"the ice is all in broken-up blocks, a swinging and a tetering up and down in the water!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know it was\u2014I know it!\" said she, wildly; \"but I did it! I wouldn't have thought I could,\u2014I didn't think I should get over, but I didn't care! I could but die, if I didn't. The Lord helped me; nobody knows how much the Lord can help 'em, till they try,\" said the woman, with a flashing eye.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Were you a slave?\" said Mr. Bird.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, sir; I belonged to a man in Kentucky.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Was he unkind to you?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, sir; he was a good master.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And was your mistress unkind to you?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, sir\u2014no! my mistress was always good to me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What could induce you to leave a good home, then, and run away, and go through such dangers?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The woman looked up at Mrs. Bird, with a keen, scrutinizing glance, and it did not escape her that she was dressed in deep mourning.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ma'am,\" she said, suddenly, \"have you ever lost a child?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question was unexpected, and it was thrust on a new wound; for it was only a month since a darling child of the family had been laid in the grave.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Bird turned around and walked to the window, and Mrs. Bird burst into tears; but, recovering her voice, she said,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why do you ask that? I have lost a little one.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Then you will feel for me. I have lost two, one after another,\u2014left 'em buried there when I came away; and I had only this one left. I never slept a night without him; he was all I had. He was my comfort and pride, day and night; and, ma'am, they were going to take him away from me,\u2014to sell him,\u2014sell him down south, ma'am, to go all alone,\u2014a baby that had never been away from his mother in his life! I couldn't stand it, ma'am. I knew I never should be good for anything, if they did; and when I knew the papers the papers were signed, and he was sold, I took him and came off in the night; and they chased me,\u2014the man that bought him, and some of Mas'r's folks,\u2014and they were coming down right behind me, and I heard 'em. I jumped right on to the ice; and how I got across, I don't know,\u2014but, first I knew, a man was helping me up the bank.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The woman did not sob nor weep. She had gone to a place where tears are dry; but every one around her was, in some way characteristic of themselves, showing signs of hearty sympathy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two little boys, after a desperate rummaging in their pockets, in search of those pocket-handkerchiefs which mothers know are never to be found there, had thrown themselves disconsolately into the skirts of their mother's gown, where they were sobbing, and wiping their eyes and noses, to their hearts' content;\u2014Mrs. Bird had her face fairly hidden in her pocket-handkerchief; and old Dinah, with tears streaming down her black, honest face, was ejaculating, \"Lord have mercy on us!\" with all the fervor of a camp-meeting;\u2014while old Cudjoe, rubbing his eyes very hard with his cuffs, and making a most uncommon variety of wry faces, occasionally responded in the same key, with great fervor. Our senator was a statesman, and of course could not be expected to cry, like other mortals; and so he turned his back to the company, and looked out of the window, and seemed particularly busy in clearing his throat and wiping his spectacle-glasses, occasionally blowing his nose in a manner that was calculated to excite suspicion, had any one been in a state to observe critically.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How came you to tell me you had a kind master?\" he suddenly exclaimed, gulping down very resolutely some kind of rising in his throat, and turning suddenly round upon the woman.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Because he was a kind master; I'll say that of him, any way;\u2014and my mistress was kind; but they couldn't help themselves. They were owing money; and there was some way, I can't tell how, that a man had a hold on them, and they were obliged to give him his will. I listened, and heard him telling mistress that, and she begging and pleading for me,\u2014and he told her he couldn't help himself, and that the papers were all drawn;\u2014and then it was I took him and left my home, and came away. I knew 't was no use of my trying to live, if they did it; for 't 'pears like this child is all I have.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Have you no husband?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, but he belongs to another man. His master is real hard to him, and won't let him come to see me, hardly ever; and he's grown harder and harder upon us, and he threatens to sell him down south;\u2014it's like I'll never see him again!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quiet tone in which the woman pronounced these words might have led a superficial observer to think that she was entirely apathetic; but there was a calm, settled depth of anguish in her large, dark eye, that spoke of something far otherwise.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And where do you mean to go, my poor woman?\" said Mrs. Bird.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To Canada, if I only knew where that was. Is it very far off, is Canada?\" said she, looking up, with a simple, confiding air, to Mrs. Bird's face.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Poor thing!\" said Mrs. Bird, involuntarily.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Is 't a very great way off, think?\" said the woman, earnestly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Much further than you think, poor child!\" said Mrs. Bird; \"but we will try to think what can be done for you. Here, Dinah, make her up a bed in your own room, close by the kitchen, and I'll think what to do for her in the morning. Meanwhile, never fear, poor woman; put your trust in God; he will protect you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Bird and her husband reentered the parlor. She sat down in her little rocking-chair before the fire, swaying thoughtfully to and fro. Mr. Bird strode up and down the room, grumbling to himself, \"Pish! pshaw! confounded awkward business!\" At length, striding up to his wife, he said,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I say, wife, she'll have to get away from here, this very night. That fellow will be down on the scent bright and early tomorrow morning: if 't was only the woman, she could lie quiet till it was over; but that little chap can't be kept still by a troop of horse and foot, I'll warrant me; he'll bring it all out, popping his head out of some window or door. A pretty kettle of fish it would be for me, too, to be caught with them both here, just now! No; they'll have to be got off tonight.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tonight! How is it possible?\u2014where to?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I know pretty well where to,\" said the senator, beginning to put on his boots, with a reflective air; and, stopping when his leg was half in, he embraced his knee with both hands, and seemed to go off in deep meditation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's a confounded awkward, ugly business,\" said he, at last, beginning to tug at his boot-straps again, \"and that's a fact!\" After one boot was fairly on, the senator sat with the other in his hand, profoundly studying the figure of the carpet. \"It will have to be done, though, for aught I see,\u2014hang it all!\" and he drew the other boot anxiously on, and looked out of the window.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, little Mrs. Bird was a discreet woman,\u2014a woman who never in her life said, \"I told you so!\" and, on the present occasion, though pretty well aware of the shape her husband's meditations were taking, she very prudently forbore to meddle with them, only sat very quietly in her chair, and looked quite ready to hear her liege lord's intentions, when he should think proper to utter them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You see,\" he said, \"there's my old client, Van Trompe, has come over from Kentucky, and set all his slaves free; and he has bought a place seven miles up the creek, here, back in the woods, where nobody goes, unless they go on purpose; and it's a place that isn't found in a hurry. There she'd be safe enough; but the plague of the thing is, nobody could drive a carriage there tonight, but me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why not? Cudjoe is an excellent driver.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ay, ay, but here it is. The creek has to be crossed twice; and the second crossing is quite dangerous, unless one knows it as I do. I have crossed it a hundred times on horseback, and know exactly the turns to take. And so, you see, there's no help for it. Cudjoe must put in the horses, as quietly as may be, about twelve o'clock, and I'll take her over; and then, to give color to the matter, he must carry me on to the next tavern to take the stage for Columbus, that comes by about three or four, and so it will look as if I had had the carriage only for that. I shall get into business bright and early in the morning. But I'm thinking I shall feel rather cheap there, after all that's been said and done; but, hang it, I can't help it!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Your heart is better than your head, in this case, John,\" said the wife, laying her little white hand on his. \"Could I ever have loved you, had I not known you better than you know yourself?\" And the little woman looked so handsome, with the tears sparkling in her eyes, that the senator thought he must be a decidedly clever fellow, to get such a pretty creature into such a passionate admiration of him; and so, what could he do but walk off soberly, to see about the carriage. At the door, however, he stopped a moment, and then coming back, he said, with some hesitation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Mary, I don't know how you'd feel about it, but there's that drawer full of things\u2014of\u2014of\u2014poor little Henry's.\" So saying, he turned quickly on his heel, and shut the door after him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His wife opened the little bed-room door adjoining her room and, taking the candle, set it down on the top of a bureau there; then from a small recess she took a key, and put it thoughtfully in the lock of a drawer, and made a sudden pause, while two boys, who, boy like, had followed close on her heels, stood looking, with silent, significant glances, at their mother. And oh! mother that reads this, has there never been in your house a drawer, or a closet, the opening of which has been to you like the opening again of a little grave? Ah! happy mother that you are, if it has not been so.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Bird slowly opened the drawer. There were little coats of many a form and pattern, piles of aprons, and rows of small stockings; and even a pair of little shoes, worn and rubbed at the toes, were peeping from the folds of a paper. There was a toy horse and wagon, a top, a ball,\u2014memorials gathered with many a tear and many a heart-break! She sat down by the drawer, and, leaning her head on her hands over it, wept till the tears fell through her fingers into the drawer; then suddenly raising her head, she began, with nervous haste, selecting the plainest and most substantial articles, and gathering them into a bundle.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Mamma,\" said one of the boys, gently touching her arm, \"you going to give away those things?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My dear boys,\" she said, softly and earnestly, \"if our dear, loving little Henry looks down from heaven, he would be glad to have us do this. I could not find it in my heart to give them away to any common person\u2014to anybody that was happy; but I give them to a mother more heart-broken and sorrowful than I am; and I hope God will send his blessings with them!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are in this world blessed souls, whose sorrows all spring up into joys for others; whose earthly hopes, laid in the grave with many tears, are the seed from which spring healing flowers and balm for the desolate and the distressed. Among such was the delicate woman who sits there by the lamp, dropping slow tears, while she prepares the memorials of her own lost one for the outcast wanderer.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After a while, Mrs. Bird opened a wardrobe, and, taking from thence a plain, serviceable dress or two, she sat down busily to her work-table, and, with needle, scissors, and thimble, at hand, quietly commenced the \"letting down\" process which her husband had recommended, and continued busily at it till the old clock in the corner struck twelve, and she heard the low rattling of wheels at the door.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Mary,\" said her husband, coming in, with his overcoat in his hand, \"you must wake her up now; we must be off.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Bird hastily deposited the various articles she had collected in a small plain trunk, and locking it, desired her husband to see it in the carriage, and then proceeded to call the woman. Soon, arrayed in a cloak, bonnet, and shawl, that had belonged to her benefactress, she appeared at the door with her child in her arms. Mr. Bird hurried her into the carriage, and Mrs. Bird pressed on after her to the carriage steps. Eliza leaned out of the carriage, and put out her hand,\u2014a hand as soft and beautiful as was given in return. She fixed her large, dark eyes, full of earnest meaning, on Mrs. Bird's face, and seemed going to speak. Her lips moved,\u2014she tried once or twice, but there was no sound,\u2014and pointing upward, with a look never to be forgotten, she fell back in the seat, and covered her face. The door was shut, and the carriage drove on.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What a situation, now, for a patriotic senator, that had been all the week before spurring up the legislature of his native state to pass more stringent resolutions against escaping fugitives, their harborers and abettors!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our good senator in his native state had not been exceeded by any of his brethren at Washington, in the sort of eloquence which has won for them immortal renown! How sublimely he had sat with his hands in his pockets, and scouted all sentimental weakness of those who would put the welfare of a few miserable fugitives before great state interests!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was as bold as a lion about it, and \"mightily convinced\" not only himself, but everybody that heard him;\u2014but then his idea of a fugitive was only an idea of the letters that spell the word,\u2014or at the most, the image of a little newspaper picture of a man with a stick and bundle with \"Ran away from the subscriber\" under it. The magic of the real presence of distress,\u2014the imploring human eye, the frail, trembling human hand, the despairing appeal of helpless agony,\u2014these he had never tried. He had never thought that a fugitive might be a hapless mother, a defenceless child,\u2014like that one which was now wearing his lost boy's little well-known cap; and so, as our poor senator was not stone or steel,\u2014as he was a man, and a downright noble-hearted one, too,\u2014he was, as everybody must see, in a sad case for his patriotism. And you need not exult over him, good brother of the Southern States; for we have some inklings that many of you, under similar circumstances, would not do much better. We have reason to know, in Kentucky, as in Mississippi, are noble and generous hearts, to whom never was tale of suffering told in vain. Ah, good brother! is it fair for you to expect of us services which your own brave, honorable heart would not allow you to render, were you in our place?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be that as it may, if our good senator was a political sinner, he was in a fair way to expiate it by his night's penance. There had been a long continuous period of rainy weather, and the soft, rich earth of Ohio, as every one knows, is admirably suited to the manufacture of mud\u2014and the road was an Ohio railroad of the good old times.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And pray, what sort of a road may that be?\" says some eastern traveller, who has been accustomed to connect no ideas with a railroad, but those of smoothness or speed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Know, then, innocent eastern friend, that in benighted regions of the west, where the mud is of unfathomable and sublime depth, roads are made of round rough logs, arranged transversely side by side, and coated over in their pristine freshness with earth, turf, and whatsoever may come to hand, and then the rejoicing native calleth it a road, and straightway essayeth to ride thereupon. In process of time, the rains wash off all the turf and grass aforesaid, move the logs hither and thither, in picturesque positions, up, down and crosswise, with divers chasms and ruts of black mud intervening.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Over such a road as this our senator went stumbling along, making moral reflections as continuously as under the circumstances could be expected,\u2014the carriage proceeding along much as follows,\u2014bump! bump! bump! slush! down in the mud!\u2014the senator, woman and child, reversing their positions so suddenly as to come, without any very accurate adjustment, against the windows of the down-hill side. Carriage sticks fast, while Cudjoe on the outside is heard making a great muster among the horses. After various ineffectual pullings and twitchings, just as the senator is losing all patience, the carriage suddenly rights itself with a bounce,\u2014two front wheels go down into another abyss, and senator, woman, and child, all tumble promiscuously on to the front seat,\u2014senator's hat is jammed over his eyes and nose quite unceremoniously, and he considers himself fairly extinguished;\u2014child cries, and Cudjoe on the outside delivers animated addresses to the horses, who are kicking, and floundering, and straining under repeated cracks of the whip. Carriage springs up, with another bounce,\u2014down go the hind wheels,\u2014senator, woman, and child, fly over on to the back seat, his elbows encountering her bonnet, and both her feet being jammed into his hat, which flies off in the concussion. After a few moments the \"slough\" is passed, and the horses stop, panting;\u2014the senator finds his hat, the woman straightens her bonnet and hushes her child, and they brace themselves for what is yet to come.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For a while only the continuous bump! bump! intermingled, just by way of variety, with divers side plunges and compound shakes; and they begin to flatter themselves that they are not so badly off, after all. At last, with a square plunge, which puts all on to their feet and then down into their seats with incredible quickness, the carriage stops,\u2014and, after much outside commotion, Cudjoe appears at the door.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Please, sir, it's powerful bad spot, this' yer. I don't know how we's to get clar out. I'm a thinkin' we'll have to be a gettin' rails.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The senator despairingly steps out, picking gingerly for some firm foothold; down goes one foot an immeasurable depth,\u2014he tries to pull it up, loses his balance, and tumbles over into the mud, and is fished out, in a very despairing condition, by Cudjoe.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But we forbear, out of sympathy to our readers' bones. Western travellers, who have beguiled the midnight hour in the interesting process of pulling down rail fences, to pry their carriages out of mud holes, will have a respectful and mournful sympathy with our unfortunate hero. We beg them to drop a silent tear, and pass on.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was full late in the night when the carriage emerged, dripping and bespattered, out of the creek, and stood at the door of a large farmhouse.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It took no inconsiderable perseverance to arouse the inmates; but at last the respectable proprietor appeared, and undid the door. He was a great, tall, bristling Orson of a fellow, full six feet and some inches in his stockings, and arrayed in a red flannel hunting-shirt. A very heavy mat of sandy hair, in a decidedly tousled condition, and a beard of some days' growth, gave the worthy man an appearance, to say the least, not particularly prepossessing. He stood for a few minutes holding the candle aloft, and blinking on our travellers with a dismal and mystified expression that was truly ludicrous. It cost some effort of our senator to induce him to comprehend the case fully; and while he is doing his best at that, we shall give him a little introduction to our readers.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Honest old John Van Trompe was once quite a considerable land-owner and slave-owner in the State of Kentucky. Having \"nothing of the bear about him but the skin,\" and being gifted by nature with a great, honest, just heart, quite equal to his gigantic frame, he had been for some years witnessing with repressed uneasiness the workings of a system equally bad for oppressor and oppressed. At last, one day, John's great heart had swelled altogether too big to wear his bonds any longer; so he just took his pocket-book out of his desk, and went over into Ohio, and bought a quarter of a township of good, rich land, made out free papers for all his people,\u2014men, women, and children,\u2014packed them up in wagons, and sent them off to settle down; and then honest John turned his face up the creek, and sat quietly down on a snug, retired farm, to enjoy his conscience and his reflections.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Are you the man that will shelter a poor woman and child from slave-catchers?\" said the senator, explicitly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I rather think I am,\" said honest John, with some considerable emphasis.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I thought so,\" said the senator.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"If there's anybody comes,\" said the good man, stretching his tall, muscular form upward, \"why here I'm ready for him: and I've got seven sons, each six foot high, and they'll be ready for 'em. Give our respects to 'em,\" said John; \"tell 'em it's no matter how soon they call,\u2014make no kinder difference to us,\" said John, running his fingers through the shock of hair that thatched his head, and bursting out into a great laugh.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Weary, jaded, and spiritless, Eliza dragged herself up to the door, with her child lying in a heavy sleep on her arm. The rough man held the candle to her face, and uttering a kind of compassionate grunt, opened the door of a small bed-room adjoining to the large kitchen where they were standing, and motioned her to go in. He took down a candle, and lighting it, set it upon the table, and then addressed himself to Eliza.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, I say, gal, you needn't be a bit afeard, let who will come here. I'm up to all that sort o' thing,\" said he, pointing to two or three goodly rifles over the mantel-piece; \"and most people that know me know that 't wouldn't be healthy to try to get anybody out o' my house when I'm agin it. So now you jist go to sleep now, as quiet as if yer mother was a rockin' ye,\" said he, as he shut the door.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, this is an uncommon handsome un,\" he said to the senator. \"Ah, well; handsome uns has the greatest cause to run, sometimes, if they has any kind o' feelin, such as decent women should. I know all about that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The senator, in a few words, briefly explained Eliza's history.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"O! ou! aw! now, I want to know?\" said the good man, pitifully; \"sho! now sho! That's natur now, poor crittur! hunted down now like a deer,\u2014hunted down, jest for havin' natural feelin's, and doin' what no kind o' mother could help a doin'! I tell ye what, these yer things make me come the nighest to swearin', now, o' most anything,\" said honest John, as he wiped his eyes with the back of a great, freckled, yellow hand. \"I tell yer what, stranger, it was years and years before I'd jine the church, 'cause the ministers round in our parts used to preach that the Bible went in for these ere cuttings up,\u2014and I couldn't be up to 'em with their Greek and Hebrew, and so I took up agin 'em, Bible and all. I never jined the church till I found a minister that was up to 'em all in Greek and all that, and he said right the contrary; and then I took right hold, and jined the church,\u2014I did now, fact,\" said John, who had been all this time uncorking some very frisky bottled cider, which at this juncture he presented.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ye'd better jest put up here, now, till daylight,\" said he, heartily, \"and I'll call up the old woman, and have a bed got ready for you in no time.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you, my good friend,\" said the senator, \"I must be along, to take the night stage for Columbus.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah! well, then, if you must, I'll go a piece with you, and show you a cross road that will take you there better than the road you came on. That road's mighty bad.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0John equipped himself, and, with a lantern in hand, was soon seen guiding the senator's carriage towards a road that ran down in a hollow, back of his dwelling. When they parted, the senator put into his hand a ten-dollar bill.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's for her,\" he said, briefly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ay, ay,\" said John, with equal conciseness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They shook hands, and parted.Embed"},

fearful moth\nHallowed be impurities of thy substance\nSlayer of heretic soul\n\nArrive within the pain and let me stand\nAmidst thy solemn absent\n'til dusk vanished our reflection\nIn grandeur of

He runs outside to check it out.\nMISTY MOUNTAINS lies twisted against the wreckage, completely nude, resembling the centerfold Bobby just saw. Bobby can't help staring, he tries to make sense of what he's seeing: that's Misty Mountains. That\u2019s her in the flesh.\nHer breath comes in hitches, gulps. Eyes, swimming. unfocused.

His hand has a scribbled message: \"YOU WILL NEVER BE HAPPY :)\" He sighs.\nMARCH (VO): I wish I wished for things, man.\n\nCut to GAS STATION\nA smog-covered gas station, filled with cars, with plenty more in a line waiting for their turn.\nHOLLAND (VO):My folks, they told me to reach for the stars, and then my pals in the force said reach for the brass ring, and then my wife died and I reached for whatever came in a gallon and cost a buck fifty. She used to say I got no follow-through. I hit nails in halfway and stop. She's not wrong.\nIn his car, March is shaving while reading the newspaper, in a page with the  headline \"Brazil's killer bee rampage continues\". Everyone else honks as a fight starts between two drivers.\nMAN: Hey, there's a line, asshole!\nMAN 2:Hey, what are you doing?\nHOLLAND (VO):They implemented a no-fault divorce here a couple of years back that really screwed things up.

I feel better already.\nHEALY: It's my job.\nAMELIA: (SIGHS) They've been following me around and asking my friends where I live.

Um...\n\nA flyer for Healy's services is seen on Amelia's back seat. Cut to him in the car after she gave him the money, with Amelia seen driving away. Healy again starts a voiceover.\nJACKSON (VO): Sometimes I feel okay about things.Not often. Could try for an investigator's licence. Become a P.I. Those guys help people. Maybe then I'd feel good in the morning.\n\nCut to: SEX SHOP\nMarch is talking to the cashier, even showing a photocopy of a driver's license.\nHOLLAND: She's got dark hair, about yea high.

Sex. More sex. My wife, she used to say I make a living off rumpy-pumpy. Whatever. She was English. I don't know what the fuck it means either.

(takes out a baseball bat) I made this.\nCut to: BAR, EXT (NIGHT)\nLater, the bartender has finished another work day, and leaves through the backdoor. March is waiting nearby for his departure\nHOLLAND (VO): Look, I'm not saying it's easy. I'm not saying you don't gotta think on your feet, bend a few rules maybe, but it's worth it, as long as you get the results.\nMarch goes up the stairs. He carefully wraps a cloth around his hands to protect them, punches through the glass... and slices his entires wrist open on the jagged shards.\nHOLLAND: Okay, that's it. That's a lot of blood. That is a lot...

The television keeps playing, Healy pushes a switch and all the lights and electrical appliances shut down. Healy leaves his apartment.\nCut to MARCH'S STREET\nHealy is seen driving to March's house. Along the way, iIn an empty lot, he sees a girl - Holly March (Angourie Rice) - mimicking opening a door and sitting somewhere to read.

Old lady hired me to find her niece on Tuesday.\nHEALY: You just gave up your client.\nMARCH:  Made a discretionary revelation.\nMarch starts to get up\nHEALY: No. No, you just gave her up.

Where is Amelia?\nHEALY: I would like to help you, but I just don't know anybody called Amelia.\nMAN:Oh. Okay. (kicks Healy in the face) You don't talk, I'm gonna have to start breaking your fingers.

(MAN SCOFFS, points to Healy) Watch him.\nHEALY:Oh, no. (GROANS) Hey, don't open that because that's not mine. It belongs to a friend. I just, uh... I look after it for him. But it's one of those bags. If you try to open it...\n(an EXPLOSION is heard. One of those security dye packs blew up in the guy's face, turning half of it blue.

I can't see nothing.\nHEALY:Yeah.\nBLUEFACE:Oh, God. What the fuck?\nStarts washing his face with the aquarium water\nBLUEFACE:Okay.

(LAUGHING) It's fucking... You're funny. You're funny.\nHe goes back to the tank and gets the other fish.\nHEALY:Don't... Don't...\nBLUE FACE: Come on, fish. You want some fucking dinner? Do you want some dinner?\nHEALY:Why are you doing this? This is not gonna help you.\nBLUE FACE: There you go.\nHEALY:Now, come on.\nBlue Face chucks the fish on Healy's chest\nBLUE FACE: You're gonna eat that thing, you fucking fuck!\nHEALY:Look, you gotta stop and think about this, all right? When you came here tonight, was this what you wanted to happen? What, you came here to make me eat fish? To shoot me? Look, if you come in here, you beat up on me, you trash the place, I understand, I get it, it's part of the job. I accept it, all right? But what did you do?  You did something different from that, didn't you? Right? You pissed me off. You made an enemy. Now, even if I knew something, I wouldn't tell you, kid. And you know why I wouldn't tell you? And this is... It's not my only reason, but it is a principle reason. You know, I wouldn't tell you 'cause you're a fucking moron.\nHealy flips the switch, everything turns on\nBLUE FACE: What the...\nBlue Face tries to shoot Healy, hits a woman in a nearby building, who screams\nOLDER GUY: You stupid son of a bitch.\nHealy grabs a shotgun, Older Guy and Blue Face run away as he shoots twice, only wrecking the apartment even more\nCut to BOWLING ALLEY, DAY\nUPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING - namely, Kiss, \"Rock And Roll All Night\" - as March's car approaches a bowling alley.

Ever since your little visit the other day, this little baby's gonna stay right here.\nThe stall door closes. As March opens it again, his cigarette falls between his legs into the toilet.\nMARCH: Fuck, fuck.\nThe door continues to close despite March's attempts.

This is a separate situation.\nMARCH: (CLICKS TONGUE) I'm not buying this nice guy act, pal. She owes you money, doesn't she? You're coming to collect?

I run the tape through and I think, \"Okay, maybe there was a girl there.\"\nHEALY:Amelia? The old lady saw Amelia?\nMARCH: Well, look who decided to show up for class. Yeah. There's a gate guard, he keeps track of all the cars that go in and out. So I checked with him, I ran the plate, I got the name.\nHEALY:And?\n[March extends three fingers]\nHEALY:Three.

Meanwhile, Healy is approached by a waitress\nWAITRESS: Drink?\nHEALY: No, I... (STUTTERS)\nHealy is still given a drink, while we see March grabbing one for himself. Healy sniffs, puts the glass on a stand... that turns out to be a woman bending over. He picks it back again.\nHEALY: Hey, uh... Sorry.\nAs March continues drinking, a SLOW ROCK SONG is PLAYING and he tries talking to the bartender\nMARCH: It's the killer bees.

In front of them, the same barmaid is questioned by Healy.\nBARMAID: Sorry.\nHEALY: Thank you.\nBARMAID: You want a drink?\nHEALY: No, thanks.\nAs Healy walks away, we see March swimming in the pool after the mermaids.\nHealy walks until he notices Holly is inside a room, and rushes to it.\nIn the room, a WOMAN is MOANING ON TV\nHEALY: Holly.

March looks puzzled before searching through the ground, eventually finding his gun and leaning against a tree.\nMARCH:(PANTING) I got it! So...There you go, March.March, March, he's our man. If he can't do it, no one can. March.\n\nJAZZ MUSIC PLAYING, as Healy walks through the party; down the slope, March then tries to light a cigarette, and his lighter illuminates a dead man's body. The cigarette starts dangling from his mouth.\nBack at the party, Healy is still searching\nHEALY: March.

I'll take you to her. Come on.\nHOLLY:Okay.\n\nDownhill, March and Healy are carrying the body.\nHEALY: What I can't figure out is how you saw him from all the way up there. You didn't fall down the fucking hill, did you? Did you fall down the hill?\nMARCH:I had like two, three drinks, tops.\nHEALY: Yeah, that's why you can't walk straight.\nMARCH:Oh, excuse me.I'm carrying a dead body and I have his schwantz in my face. So, I'm sorry I'm not Bakishnarov.\nHEALY: You can't even say Baryshnikov. You did, didn't you? You fell down that fucking hill. You get drunk, you lose your gun, you take a header off the balcony and now you're gonna tell me it's like a hallowed, time-honoured detective ploy, right?\nMARCH:It was very slippery up there, okay? I was... I was in the pool.\nHEALY: You were in the pool?\nMARCH:Yeah.\nHEALY: Why?\nMARCH: I had to question the mermaids. What were you doing while I was working? (Healy just stands silent) Thank you.\nHEALY: Let's get rid of this guy.\nMARCH: Oh, God.\nThe two dump Shadduck's body over a fence, where it crashes onto the table of a wedding reception, horrifying everyone.\nGUEST: Oh, God!

Bye.\nHealy stumbles upon the Older Guy. Once they recognize each other, Older Guy tries grabbing his gun, while Healy throws a drink at him. Everyone around screams and runs away as the two men start fighting.\nOnce Older Guy's gun goes off, MARCH turns his head. The two men keep fighting, with the gun eventually being fired at the Tree Man, who falls down the balcony. March is startled. Healy manages to make the gun fall in a hot tub, while getting punched by Older Guy. They continue their struggle,  with Older Guy even getting a knife. March tries getting to the location where they fight, but the staircase is filled with people\nMARCH : Excuse me. Excuse me.\n\nMeanwhile, in Blue Face's car...\nHOLLY: I need to go right now.\nBLUEFACE: Don't touch...\nHolly punches him in the face\nHOLLY: Get away from me.\nOutside, a worried Amelia talks to the valet.\nAMELIA: I need my keys. I need my car. Hurry.\nBLUEFACE: [to Holly] Don't fucking move.\nAMELIA (O.S.): Hurry. I need my keys.\nBlueface is SHUSHING Holly as he grabs his gun. He opens the door, points the gun at Amelia...\nAMELIA:Hello? Please! Hurry, hurry. Now!\nHolly slams the door on his hand, making the shot hit the valet's box of keys. Everyone screams, and Holly rolls out the car.\nBLUEFACE: Fuck! Motherfucker, my fucking hand!\nHOLLY: Amelia! Run!\nAmelia runs, while PEOPLE keep GROANING and Holly closes the door before rushing out of there, going  after Amelia.\nMarch runs to outside the house, pushing the obstructing people into the pool.\nInside the car, Blueface has recovered himself...\nBLUEFACE: Drive the fucking car.\n...and TYRES SCREECHING are heard as it goes away, just as March arrives. He looks both ways, finds nothing, but then  the valet calls him.\nVALET:Hey, man. The girl in your trunk, she was in that car.\nMARCH runs towards a guy standing next to his open  car and throws him on the ground\nMAN: Johnny's car!\nMarch starts the vehicle and closes the door.\nJOHNNY: Hey, man, what are you doing with my car?\nTYRES SCREECHING as March continues to leave.\nBy the hot tub, Healy manages to stick Older Guy's knife into a fusebox, making him fall on his back unarmed, while Healy is thrown into the edge of the tub. When Older Guy recovers, he punches Healy in the head, presses him towards the tub, trying to drown him.\nOLDER GUY: Motherfucker!\nIt all stops once a shot is fired from within the tub, hitting Older Guy's knee. He falls on his back,while Healy returns to the surface, the gun in his hand.\nOLDER GUY: Oh, shit.\nHealy throws more punches into Older Guy, making him fall on his back.\nHEALY: I swear to God, you get up, I'll shoot you in the cock.\nOLDER GUY: (SLURRING) I can pay you.\nHEALY:Trying to negotiate with me?\nOLDER GUY: You'll never see me again.\nHEALY:Where are you gonna be?\nOLDER GUY: Michigan.\nHEALY:Michigan works.\n\nHealy walks away, tossing the gun back into the hot tub. When he gets by the balcony, he can see the street below, where Amelia, followed by Holly, are running away. A screeching limo stops, and Blue Face gets out to run after the girls. Healy starts going away from the house.\nOn the road, Blue Face hears TYRES SCREECHING - it's March in the car he hijacked. Blue Face shoots the windshield, leading March to skid, and then run up a tiny hill to crash the car. A startled March tries to recover, Blue Face runs for the women again, and as March groans, Healy appears in front of the car.\n\nHEALY: You okay? Does the car still go? Well, stop fucking around. Come on.\n\nHealy continues his run, and then March gets a determined look in his face before starting the engine. But the car is stuck between the dirt and the sidewalk.\nMARCH: Fuck!\n\nNot far, Blue Face catches up with Amelia and Holly, who are now side by side.\nBLUEFACE: Freeze!You guys are fast.\nAmelia embraces Holly.\nBLUEFACE Whoo! (LAUGHS)\nHOLLY:There's a...\nAmelia tries shutting her up. As We hear a CAR HONKING, and said vehicle, a van, runs over Blueface. The driver stops as the girls run for the van...\nDRIVER: Holy shit!\n...which then goes away, making AMELIA put her arms up and GROAN. She goes for Holly's wrist...\nAMELIA: Come on.\nHOLLY: Wait. Wait.\nAMELIA: What the hell are you doing?\nHOLLY: He's hurt. We need to help him.\nAMELIA: Are you crazy? Stay away from him.\nHOLLY: Just... Just hang on. We need to help him.\nAs Holly goes for Blueface, Amelia SIGHS and runs away. She grabs the fallen man's hand.\nHOLLY: It's okay.\nBLUEFACE COUGHS\nHOLLY: You're gonna be all right. I'll... I'll get help. It's all right.\nHealy arrives.\nHOLLY: A car hit him. We need an ambulance.\nHEALY: Holly, go and see if you can flag somebody down. He's in a bad way.\nHolly agrees and runs away, and Healy crouches to take Blueface's dropped gun, unload it and clean the fingerprints.\nBLUEFACE: (GROANS)You.\nHEALY:Yeah, me.\nBLUEFACE:You ever hear of John Boy? By now he's heard of you. They're flying him in. (CHUCKLES) Now he's gonna kill that private cop and his whole fucking family. And then he's gonna come for you. You ain't got long to live.\nHEALY:Well, buddy, none of us do.\nHEALY chokes Blueface using the handkerchief that cleaned the gun; Holly returns\nHOLLY: Healy, there's no one here.\nHEALY:He didn't make it.\nHolly looks at Blueface, and then notices a CAR APPROACHING. It's March. Holly breathes in relief, and runs to embrace her father.\nMARCH: Are you okay?\nHOLLY: Yeah.\nHealy nods to March, and they hear SIRENS WAILING\nHEALY:(SIGHS) And that'll be the cops.\n\nCut to FRONT OF THE HOUSE\nThe police have surrounded the street.\nMAN: Okay, Holly...\nOFFICER: What do you want me to do with them?\nMARCH: Look, pal, you already got our statements. Can I go see my daughter now?\nOFFICER:Sir, I was told to keep you here, so I'm keeping you here. Just following orders.\nMARCH: You know who else was just following orders? Hitler.\nAn African American woman, Tally (Yaya DaCosta), approaches\nTALLY:Officer. You're Mr March, I think. And you are... Wait, I know you. (STAMMERS) You're the guy. The diner guy, right? From last year, right?\nHEALY: Yeah.\nTALLY: Yeah. My name is Tally. If you'll follow me, my boss would like a word. Please.\nMARCH: I'm sorry. The diner guy?\nHEALY: I'll tell you later. Don't worry about it.\n\nThey approach a limousine with  its window down, revealing its passenger, Judith Kuttner (Kim Basinger)\nJUDITH: How do you do?\nMARCH: About this good most of the time.\nJUDITH: My name is Judith Kuttner. I work for the Department of Justice.\nMARCH: Okay. Well, that explains basically nothing.\nJUDITH: I... I'm Amelia's mother.\n\nCut to DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nIn the reception, Tally is doing magic tricks to distract Holly...\nTALLY: Holly, are you still frowning? (GASPS) What's in my hand? What? (she makes a card appear in her hand, Holly GASPS, Tally LAUGHS)\nHOLLY: I know how you do that.\n...while in Judith office, Judith talks to Healy and March.\nJUDITH: Hello. Sit. First of all, I wanna say thank you. We've been watching interviews, and it sounds like you might have saved my daughter's life.\nHEALY: That was mostly Holly.  His daughter.\nMARCH:It's genetics.\nJUDITH: Would you like a mint?\nMARCH:Uh, yeah.\nJUDITH: I need your help. But I wanna know if I can trust you.\nHEALY: I'm kinda getting the idea that, you know, you might not have much choice.\nJUDITH: Well, my situation is very delicate.\nHEALY: Hey, that's where I know you from, right? The TV. You're prosecuting that car company thing.\nJUDITH: The lawsuit for the catalytic converter. Yes. That's half my day. The other half I spend on pornography.\nMARCH: Hmm. What kind? Like which films? What's your favourite?\nHEALY: No, no. Uh, anti. Anti-porn.\nMARCH: Right.  Like a crusader.  Should I be writing this down?\nHEALY: Yeah, write it down.\n[he grabs a pen and paper]\nJUDITH: The Vegas mob is trying to spread its porn operation to Hollywood Boulevard. (SCOFFS)  And I'm doing everything I can to stop it.\nMARCH:Thank you. Porn is bad.\nHEALY: Something I don't understand. Your daughter, she did a film with Sid Shattuck. Now, why would she do that when she knows that's just gonna be extremely professionally\nembarrassing for you?\nJUDITH: 'Cause she wanted to. She lashes out. We have a difficult relationship.\nMARCH: Mothers and daughters, it's tough.\nJUDITH: But there's no film, not any more. There was a fire. Um... A friend of Amelia's, he...\nHEALY: Dean. Yeah, we went to his house. Well, what's left of his house.\nMARCH: Mrs Kuttner, why do you think everyone involved with this film is dying?\nJUDITH: I have no idea, Mr March. I wish I did. I only know that Amelia's in danger.\nHEALY: Why don't you put her in protective custody? I mean, after tonight, she's probably very scared. She... She might wanna be at home.\nJUDITH: She doesn't trust me. She thinks I am the government. She thinks I'm behind all of this. Somewhere she's out there and she won't call home because she thinks her mother's going to have her killed.\n(JUDITH SNIFFLING as Healy and March look at each other)\nHEALY (extending the bloody handkerchief): Here. You wanna use that?\nJUDITH: No, thank you.\nHEALY:No?\nJUDITH: I wanna hire you both. Please, find her, protect her.\nMARCH: Okay, you can hire us, but we're not cheap. (Judith is writing a check, with \"TEN THOUSAND\" in the value) This is very intensive work and something like this, I'd say couldn't do it for less than $5,000.\nJUDITH: Okay. (throws away the check)\n(March leans over to check reception, as Holly is doing card tricks as TALLY LAUGHS)\nHOLLY: Yes, I got it.\nTALLY: Okay, I gotta get mine now.\nMARCH: Can I take this?\nJUDITH: Fine.\nMARCH: Does Tally have one of... Shall we have hers as well? Just in case you're not... You know, we need to get in touch with somebody.\n\nCut to MARCH'S HOUSE\nHealy walks to March, who is tossing cigarette buns into an empty pool and drinking.\nHEALY: So what's this? World's biggest ashtray?\nMARCH: (SIGHS) Fuck it, it's... It's a rental. We're only here until we rebuild the old place anyway.\nHEALY:Rebuild?\nMARCH: Yeah. It burned down.\nHEALY:Hey, you know, something's actually bugging me. I found this in Shattuck's office.\nHe shows the cow note.\nMARCH: What is that, a pig? (CHUCKLES)\nHEALY:No, it's a pink cow.\nMARCH: Oh, it's a cow.\nHEALY:When Amelia gave me your address, she gave it to me on a piece of paper like this, handwriting like that.\nMARCH: I think you're onto something.\nHEALY:Mmm-hmm.\nMARCH: Can we talk about it tomorrow afternoon?\nHEALY:Yeah, we can do that.\nMARCH: Thanks.\n(JACKSON CLEARS THROAT and starts walking away)\nMARCH: Hey, aren't you that diner guy? Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. I gotta know.\nHEALY:I don't wanna get into it right now.\nMARCH: You gotta get into it. I gotta know. You're the diner guy.\nHEALY: (SIGHS)All right.\nMARCH: Yes.\nHEALY:All right, about a year ago...\nMARCH: Yes.\nAs Healy tells the story, flashbacks showing the events also appear\nHEALY:...I was at a diner in Hollywood and this asshole with a shotgun started threatening people.\nMarch is lying on his back.\nMARCH:  I love it. It's the best story I've ever heard.\nIn the flashback, Healy grabs the shotgun, and hits the guy in the face with it\nHEALY: So I did something about it. I acted. I didn't plan to, I didn't, you know. I just did it. I took that guy out. I didn't even get paid for it. So I ended up with a bullet in the bicep and 500 bucks of hospital bills. It was stupid, really. When I think about it, it was the best day of my life.\nMarch is SNORING\nHEALY: Just for a moment, I felt useful. All right.\n\nCut to EMPTY LOT\nHealy is driving back, when he notes Holly in the lot again. There, she is reading, this time holding with a flashlight.\nHOLLY: \"Had Mademoiselle Blanche been in England before? What part of France did she come from? Mademoiselle Blanche replied politely but with reserve.\"\nHEALY:Hey.\nHOLLY:Hey.You've got your foot in the toilet.\nHEALY:I have? (SIGHS)\nHOLLY:Now you're getting the carpet all wet.\nHEALY:Was this your room?\nHOLLY:No, it was Mom and Dad's.\nHEALY:Your dad tells me you're rebuilding.\nHOLLY:Does it look rebuilt to you?\nHEALY:Not especially.\nHOLLY:Dad barely ever comes here. He feels guilty, I guess.\nHEALY:Because? Hmm?\nHOLLY:Oh, the fire. Mom kept on complaining about a leak in the furnace, but Dad, you know, he's got his nose thing,\nso he couldn't smell the gas. Anyways, I should probably\nget back to my book.\nHEALY:All right.\nHOLLY:Mr Healy? Are you a bad person? What did you do to tha1t man tonight? Did you kill him?\nHEALY:Of course not.\nHOLLY:That's good. I knew you couldn't do something like that.\nHEALY:Don't stay up too late, all right?\nHe enters his car again, reflects a bit, and closes his eyes.\nCut to OUTSIDE MARCH'S HOUSE, DAY\nHolly is driving March's car as he, clearly hammered, vocalizes along with the radio and bangs on the car door. Healy is waiting outside the house, when Holly parks by hitting  somethin g in the ground loudly. They turn their heads, and get concerned as they see Healy.\nMARCH:Shit.\nNow both are outside, Holly with a box and March with a recently washed suit.\nHEALY: I didn't know what time you'd get here. You said afternoon.\nMARCH: Well, uh, we were at the bank getting your money. (Hands Healy an envelop) There it is, half, minus a few hundred, you know, for, uh, that car that we crashed. I thought you'd wanna chip in for that.\nHEALY: Sure.\nMarch shows Healy the suit.\nMARCH: What do you think?\nHEALY: It's purple.\nMARCH: It's maroon.\nHolly SIGHS as she walks towards the door.\nHOLLY: We stopped at a bar. That's why we're late.\n\nCut to MARCH'S KITCHEN\nHEALY: So, Amelia's note. Burbank Airport. Western flight D. I figure she's trying to skip town. How do you wanna do this?\nMARCH: (EXHALES) I don't know. I say we wait a couple of days, call Kuttner and see if we can squeeze a second instalment out of her. (extends his glass as if toasting and chugs)\nHEALY: A second instalment?\nHOLLY: You don't wanna call too soon. Gotta act like you're onto something, like you've been working hard. Then, day three, ask for more money. (fake smile)\nMARCH: Well, she's putting a negative spin on it, but, yeah, that's the idea.\nHEALY: Kuttner paid us. Me. She paid me to do a job, right? I'm not gonna lie to her.\nMARCH: And I respect that. That's why I'll lie to her.\nHey, I shelled out 400 bucks for a detective. Someone who finds clues, huh?\nMARCH: I found Sid Shattuck's corpse, didn't I?\nHEALY:Found it? You fell on it.\nMARCH: I guess I don't understand why we're not celebrating. I mean, we just got paid. We're all having a drink in the afternoon.\nMarch and Healy stare at him\nMARCH: What?\nHEALY:Forget about it, all right?\nMARCH:  (SIGHS) Oh, would you just... Would you hold on for a goddamn second?\nHOLLY:You're the world's worst detective.\nMARCH: I'm the worst?\nHOLLY:Yeah.\nMARCH: The world's worst?\nHOLLY:Didn't you hear me the first time?\nMarch opens the the fridge to show his newspaper ad.\nMARCH: Got a cool ad, though. So...\nHOLLY:(SCOFFS) Why do you have to be such a fuck-up, huh? You go around and you drink and you lie and stuff and people hate you.\nMARCH: Sweetheart, don't say, \"and stuff.\" Just say...\nHOLLY:I hate you!\nShe SIGHS and turns her back on him.\nMARCH: That works.\nHEALY: I'll find the girl myself.\nMARCH: You're gonna find her yourself. Okay. Well, say hi to her when you do.\nHEALY:I will.\nHealy is almost going through the open door...\nMARCH: Course, you're not gonna find her at the airport, seeing as how it's not a flight.\n...and walks back\nMARCH: Did he stop?\nHOLLY:Yeah.\nMARCH: Your note, look at it. It's not a flight. Every airport has an overflight curfew from 10:00 to 6:00, Burbank included. And that top number is today's date but reversed like the European way, which makes sense when you look at FLT and you think it's not \"flight,\" it's probably \"flat,\" like apartment.\nHEALY: And Burbank APT West?\nMARCH: Burbank Apartments West. It's a dump. Fuck it, I'll show you.Holly, go to Janet's this time. But for real.\nHOLLY:Jessica's.\nMARCH: Jessica's. We've gotta go to work.\nHOLLY: Do you want your keys?\nHEALY: I'm driving.\nHolly smiles once the DOOR SHUTS\nCut to CONSTRUCTION SITE, NIGHT\nMarch and Healy drive and get to where Burbank Apartments West was supposed to be, but there is only an empty lot with an excavator and a billboard. They get off the car and ask a man walking his dog\nHEALY: Excuse me. We're lo oking for the Burbank Apartments.\nMAN: Oh, they're gone. Tore them babies down, um, going on about two years now.\nThe frustrated Healy turns to March, not saying a word...\nMARCH: To the airport, then? (CLEARS THROAT)\n\nCut to HEALY'S CAR, ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT\nMARCH: Well, they used to have an overflight curfew.\nHEALY: It's all right. It's all right. It's okay.\nMARCH:They did.\nHEALY: Yeah.\nMARCH:And they still should if they changed them. They should, they should change them back.\nAs a descending AIRCRAFT's ENGINE ROARS, March notices something...\nMARCH:Pull over.\nHEALY: What?\nMARCH:Pull over.\nHe grabs the wheel to force the car to stop.\nHEALY:  Hey, what the fuck?\nHealy then notes the building in front of them...\nHOLLAND: The Western Hotel. The Burbank Airport Western Hotel.\nHEALY: She's meeting somebody. Okay.\n\nCut to HOTEL BAR\nAfter the two go through the door they head to the bar.\nBARTENDER: Evening. What can I get you?\nMARCH: Information. Have you seen this girl? She probably came in in the last half hour.\nBARTENDER:(SCOFFS) Hey, I just work here.\nMARCH:Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. That's why I'm asking you.\nBARTENDER:Hmm. Memory gets a little foggy, you know.What's in it for me?\nMARCH:He'll stop doing it.\nBARTENDER:(CHUCKLES) Doing what?\nHealy slams his face onto the counter.\nBARTENDER:Ow!\nMARCH: That.\nBARTENDER:Fuck!\nHEALY:Now, we can do this the easy way or we can... We're currently doing it the easy way.\nBARTENDER:Okay. Jesus. The penthouse. She's in the penthouse, top floor.(SIGHS) Are you happy?\nMARCH: Yeah.\nBARTENDER:Guys, listen. You... You don't wanna go up there, all right? Trust me. These New York guys are up there. Uh, business guys. They got fucking bodyguards. Kind that had their balls removed. What's that called? Huh?\nHEALY: Marriage?\nBARTENDER:Yeah. Uh... Just chill here, you know. She's gotta come back down. Have a couple of cold ones on me?\nHEALY: Oh, not for me.\nHOLLAND: He makes a strong argument, though.\nBARTENDER:You see? Reasonable. Very reasonable. Now, your buddy, that was the problem, he wasn't reasonable.\nHEALY: Our buddy?\nHOLLAND: Yeah, we don't have friends.\nBARTENDER:The other guy looking for Amelia, he wasn't with you?\nHEALY:Where'd he go?\nBARTENDER:Got in the elevator right before you guys came in.\nHEALY:Did you get a name?\nBARTENDER:John something.\nHEALY:Did you actually witness him getting into the elevator?\nBARTENDER:No, it was told to me by a wise old Indian. Of course I fucking witnessed it.\nHEALY:Right.\nMARCH: What the hell's going on?\nHEALY:Oh, it just makes sense. It connects up.\nMARCH:What makes sense?\nHEALY:John Boy. Oh, just something that Blueface mentioned, yeah.\nMARCH:What do you mean, he mentioned?Mentioned how?\nHEALY:Oh, you know, he... \"There's a guy coming to kill you.\" That kind of crap.\nMARCH: Yeah. We should probably just stay here.\nHEALY: Smart move. Unless, of course, he's up there killing her right now.\nMARCH:Nobody's getting killed at the Burbank Airport Hotel.\nHEALY:Because?\nMARCH:That would be national news.\nHEALY:Yeah, so?\nMARCH:Oh, so when's the last time you were on national news?\nHEALY:February.\nMARCH:Really?\nHEALY:Yeah.\nMARCH:For what?\nHEALY:I got shot, in a diner.\nMARCH:Where?\nHEALY:In my arm. I told you this last night.\nMARCH:We should call the cops.\nHEALY:No. It'll take too long. I mean, she could die.\nMARCH: You just said it was the right move to stay down here.\nHEALY:No, I said smart move. Different.\nThe two then walk to elevator.\nCut to ELEVATOR\nThey enter, BREATHE DEEPLY and stand in the regular pose.\nMARCH: Munich.\nHEALY: What?\nMARCH: A guy without his balls. It's a Munich.\nHEALY: Munich is a city in Germany. M\u00fcnchen. Munich. Yeah.\nMARCH: Right. Hitler only had one ball.\n(ELEVATOR DINGS.)\n\nCut to PENTHOUSE FLOOR\nJACKSON: All right, here we go.\nOn the corridor, a MAN is CHOKING, with his throat slit\nMAN: Hey! (GRUNTING) Whoa!\nThe man who just yelled is hit with MUFFLED GUNSHOTS. March and Healy just press the elevator button and walk back inside... witnessing besides them a man being thrown out the window.\nCut to HEALY'S CAR, OUTSIDE HOTEL\nHealy is rushing away, the TYRES SCREECHING. Then they hear SIRENS WAILING...\nHEALY: Oh, shit.\nHealy enters in a nearby one-way alley, BRAKES SCREECHING, as the police cars are coming to the hotel. After they all pass...\nMARCH:What are we doing?\nHEALY: I can't just leave.\nMARCH:Why?\nHEALY: She's in danger, man. We have to do something about it.\nMARCH:She's dead.\nHEALY: What do you mean, she's dead?\nMARCH:Come on!\nHEALY: She's not dead.\nMARCH:Open your eyes, man.\nHEALY: You don't know that.\nMARCH: She's fucking dead!\nHEALY: You don't know she's...\nAmelia lands feet-first on the car. She walks to the hood, tries to shoot at them, but the recoil knocks her off her feet and she goes unconscious on the street below. They open the car and retrieve her\nCut to LIVING ROOM\nTelevision BEEPING on a game of PONG. It's Holly and Jessica in March's house. March and Healy enter, the latter carrying Amelia.\nMARCH: What are you doing here?\nHOLLY: Holy shit, you got her.\nMARCH: You're supposed to be at Jessica's.\nJESSICA: Yeah, sorry, Mr March. My sister kicked us out. She's having a guy over.\nMARCH:  Your sister's such a slut.\nJESSICA: Yeah, I know.\n\nCut to Holly's bedroom\nAmelia is put on Holly's bed\nHEALY: Hello? Amelia. Should you shake her shoulder? Maybe... You know, my brother used to flick my ear. Like that. I hated that.\nHOLLY: We shouldn't be violent.\nMARCH:You got a brother?\nJESSICA: You could just hit her.\nHEALY:Yeah.\nMARCH:Really?\nJESSICA: Like really hard.\nHEALY:I've got a family.\nHOLLY: It's not practical.\nJACKSON: We probably shouldn't hit her if we want her to talk to us.\nAmelia awakens\nHEALY: It's okay.\nAMELIA:You were supposed to get those guys off of me.\nMARCH: Do you know who they were? Do you know who sent them?\nAMELIA:Yeah. It was my mother.\nHEALY: Would you mind starting from the top because...\nAMELIA:Why? It doesn't matter.\nMARCH: I'm sorry, it doesn't matter? You just shot at us. I think it matters.\nAMELIA:Okay, okay. I made a film. I made a film with Dean, my boyfriend. And the idea was that we were gonna, you know, like make this experimental film, like an artistic film.\nMARCH:Porno film.\nAMELIA:It's not a porno. (SIGHS) Look, do you even know who my mother is?\nHEALY: Yes, we do. We... We've actually met your mother.\nAMELIA:(SCOFFING) What did she tell you, that I'm crazy?(STAMMERS) That I was just lashing out?\nHEALY: Something like that. She might have mentioned...\nAMELIA:Yeah, well, my mother is a criminal. She's one of them.\nMARCH: Who's them? What's them?\nAMELIA: One of the insiders. One of the capitalist, corporate suppressors. You know, they want us dead, man. We're just in their crosshairs, you know. We're just pawns.\nJESSICA: Gosh.\nAMELIA: (SIGHS) Ow.\nMARCH: Hey. (WHISTLES SLOWLY, the girls leave) And what does this have to do with the birds?\nJACKSON: Yeah.\nAMELIA:My mom's supposed to be working for the Justice Department, right?\nHEALY: Sure, she's prosecuting the catalytic converter case.\nAMELIA:Yeah, only she's not. She's not prosecuting it. The auto makers, she's gonna let 'em walk.\nMARCH: But they have the evidence.\nAMELIA:Yes, they have evidence. They have memos proving that Detroit conspired to suppress the converter, proving they would rather poison our air than spend a little bit of money. But my mom, she's gonna say that's not enough. She's gonna lie because... Because she's on the take. Money again, right? Mammon, that's her god. That fascist crony...\nMARCH: Okay, okay.\nAMELIA:...bogart!\nMARCH: All right, all right, just... Just back up a little bit. (SIGHS) Why not just go straight to the police?\nAMELIA:(LAUGHING) She is the police. She's the head of the Justice Department.\nHEALY: You... You've got a point.\nMARCH: Okay, or the newspaper?\nAMELIA:They all work together. God, have you been living under a rock?\nHEALY:All right, so then your solution -was you make a porn film.\nAMELIA:(SIGHS) It's not a porno!\nMARCH: You know, I have neighbours.\nAMELIA:I made a statement.\nHEALY: Right.\nAMELIA:And yeah, yeah, my statement contained nudity.\nMARCH:Porno nudity.\nAMELIA: Art. That's just the commercial element, okay? Okay? Sid said we had to have that. And the reality was we were getting our message out there. And... And it was all in the film, names and dates and everything, everything that my mom was doing, and once it was out there, once it was in theatres, there's no way that they could suppress it. There's no way that they could cover it up.\nMARCH: So let me get this straight. You made a porno film where the point was the plot?\nAMELIA:(SIGHS) What's your hang-up, man?\nJACKSON: It's not the sex. It's... It's what's in the story.\nAMELIA:My mom found out. (SIGHS) She killed Dean and destroyed the film.\nHEALY: Your mom killed Dean?\nAMELIA:Of course. She killed Misty, too.\nHOLLY: And Sid Shattuck?\nAMELIA: Yeah.\nMARCH: Okay, so it's like Jack the Ripper and then your mom, basically.\n(Amelia SIGHS)\nHOLLY: So what are you gonna do?\nAMELIA: I don't know. I'm just really tired, you know.\nHEALY: Uh, all right, okay. So, uh, you... We're just gonna talk about it and we'll think and you get some rest.\nMARCH: Yeah, just get some rest.\n\nThey all walk back to the corridor.\nMARCH:What do you think?\nHOLLY:I like her.\nJESSICA:I like her dress.\nMARCH:It's a nice dress. But she's a loon. According to her, her mother's single-handedly gonna wipe out all of Western society.\nHEALY: Well, yeah. However, there are people trying to kill her, right?\nMARCH: Like John Boy.\nHOLLY: Who's John Boy?\nJESSICA: He's on The Waltons.\nHEALY: No, different John Boy.\nMARCH: Well, we think.\nHEALY: Think, yeah. Pretty sure.\n(TELEPHONE RINGING)\nMARCH: Can't be sure, though. Yeah.\n\nThe call is from Judith's office.\nTALLY: Mr March, I just got a call from Judith. She didn't explain herself. Said she needed $100,000 in cash.\nMARCH: $100,000? Why?\nTALLY: I don't know. -I think she's involved in something shady maybe.\nMARCH: Well, her daughter certainly seems to think so.\nTALLY: What, Amelia? You found Amelia?\nMARCH: Yes. She fell on our car. We were just talking and she fell on our car. Anyway, she's here. You should come over.\nTALLY: I... I'll send the family doctor.\n(SIGHS)\nTALLY: Okay, look, Mr March...\nMARCH: Holland, please.\nTALLY: I've got a bad feeling about this. Would you be willing to carry the money for me?\n\nCut to OUTSIDE DEPT OF JUSTICE\nHEALY: I wish I knew who to believe on this one.\nMARCH: Well, the kid's a write-off, I'll tell you that much.\nHEALY: Maybe they're both telling the truth.\nMARCH: We're downstairs. She's coming down. What do you mean, they're both telling the truth? What the fuck does that mean?\nHEALY: I got a friend, right? Secret Service. Worked the Nixon detail. This was after they threw him out of office. No. Anyway, you know, Nixon's driving around one day around San Clemente. Just him and a few agents.\nMARCH: Yeah.\nHEALY: And they come across this car accident, right? There's a guy pinned under a car. Anyway, Nixon gets out, runs over to check on the guy, you know, leans down, and Nixon says to him, \"You're gonna be okay, son. You're gonna be all right.\" And right then the guy dies.\nMARCH: I don't get it.\nHEALY: Think about it from that guy's point of view, okay? The guy who died. He's lying there on the ground, staring up at the sky, near death, and then former president Richard Nixon appears before him and tells him he's gonna be fine. Now, did he think that's normal, right, that before they die, everybody sees Nixon?\nMARCH: You're expecting an angel and you get Nixon.\nHEALY: Exactly. Right?\nMARCH: Yeah.\nHEALY: It's the same situation, just a vastly different point of view.\nMARCH: So there's two ways to look at something.\nHEALY: Yeah.\nMARCH: That's the point of the story?\nHEALY: Yeah.\nMARCH: Yeah, just say that.\nHEALY: What?\nMARCH: Well, you just lead me on this epic fucking journey with this story, and 10 minutes later, the point is that there's two ways to look at something. Just... You could just say that.\nHEALY: You didn't like that story?\nMARCH: That would be awful.\nHEALY: Wouldn't it, right?\nMARCH: Yeah.\nHEALY: It would suck, right?\nMARCH: Oh.\nTally then appears, handing them a briefcase.\nMARCH: Hey.\nTALLY: Thank God. $100,000. Packed it myself. Just... It's not common you find such nice people in the world.\nMARCH: (LAUGHS)I'm sorry about him. He just wanted to come along. I don't know why. But I'll call you, you know, when we make the drop.\nTALLY: Thank you.\n\nCut to MARCH'S CAR\nMARCH:  Are you nervous at all?\nHEALY: Me? No. I got insurance. [shows a holster in his ankle] This baby right here.\nMARCH: Is that an ankle gun?\nHEALY: That is an ankle gun, yeah.\nMARCH: That's pretty sweet.\nHEALY: Uh-huh.\nMARCH: I'm falling asleep at the wheel here, man. I'm gonna need you to drive. I'm gonna pull over up here.\nHEALY: You don't have to pull over. The car can drive itself.\nMARCH: What?\nHEALY: Just take your hands off the wheel, man.\nSaid and done, the car is driving itself\nMARCH: Hmm. I didn't know it could do that.\nHe then lights a cigarette\nHEALY: Where you been, man? Every car can do this.\nWe then see a (smoking) giant bee is in the backseat.\nBUMBLE: Yeah, March, where the fuck have you been, man? Idiot. You didn't know that?\nMARCH: You fly everywhere. You don't even drive.What do you know?\nHEALY:  He's got a point there, Bumble.\nBUMBLE: Yeah, whatever. I used to fly all the time, but now the smog is just disgusting, man. It's just this pollution is out of control. All the bees are riding around in cars these days.\nHEALY: Wake up! Wake up!\nA sleeping March is revealed on the wheel\nHEALY: March! Wake up! (TYRES SQUEALING, cones being hit and flying, we're back to reality...) March! Wake up!\nMarch wakes up, sees he's losing control and tries to put the car back on the road, SHRIEKING like a girl again\nHEALY: Shit. Shit.\nBut they end up crashing against water barrels, causing the briefcase to fall out and spill the contents everywhere. It's not money, but a bunch of paper clippings.\nHEALY: That's not money.\nMARCH: Tally packed it herself. She said so. Why? Why would she send us off on some wild fucking goose chase?\nHEALY:Amelia.\nMarch in a payphone. The LINE is only BEEPING, he angrily puts it back and rushes to the car\nCut to MARCH'S HOUSE\nJessica is on the phone while Holly plays Solitaire.\nJESSICA: No, like The Waltons. Yeah? Yeah, on TV. Richard something? Yeah. Who's that actor?\nHOLLY: Jessica, get off the phone.\nJESSICA:  Yeah. Anyway, so this new John Boy's like a murderer or something. Uh-huh.\n(DOORBELL RINGS)\nJESSICA: Shit. Now it's gonna bug me.\nHolly opens the door, it's a man in black with a mole in his face (Matt Bomer)\nMAN:You must be Holly. Dr Malek.\nHOLLY:Hi.\n\"MALEK\":Hi.\nHOLLY:She's inside. Come in.\n\"MALEK\":Thank you.\nHe enters\nJESSICA: Yeah, I don't know...\n\"MALEK\":You mind fetching your dad?\nHOLLY:Uh, he's running an errand.\n\"MALEK\":Back anytime soon?\nHOLLY:Oh, hour, tops.\n\"MALEK\":Fine. Now, then, Nurse Holly, how's our patient? [nods to Jessica] That's her?\nHOLLY:Oh, no, that's Jessica.  What she's got you can't fix.\n\"MALEK\":(CHUCKLES) You are very funny.\nHOLLY: (points to the bedrooom) In there. Asleep. Slight fever.\n\"MALEK\":Hmm. On drugs you think? Maybe smoking the reefer? What was she saying?Was she making sense?\nJESSICA: Hold on. Um... Holly, what's the name of the guy on The Waltons that plays John Boy? With the hockey puck on his face?\nHOLLY: (CHUCKLES) That show's for retards. Dr Malek, would you like a cookie? Just baked them.\nJESSICA:There's none left. I looked, remember?\nHOLLY: No, there's a couple. Doctor?\nHolly goes to the kitchen...\nJOHN-BOY:I could be persuaded. After I have a look at Sleeping Beauty.\n...and takes the gun from the cookie pot, cocks it as she points it at John-Boy, who extends his arms and SIGHS\nJOHN-BOY:Nurse Holly.\nHe drops his suitcase, which makes a THUDDING noise\nJOHN-BOY:Holly, what are you doing? Are you crazy?\nHOLLY: There are handcuffs behind the bar, asshole. Get them.\nJOHN-BOY:This is really slowing me down, Holly.\nJESSICA: What's going on?\nHOLLY: Jessica, it's him. He's the guy.\nJOHN-BOY:Jessica, if you help me with this,[takes out a knife] I'll only kill Holly.\nCut to March's car approaching, and then back to the house\nHOLLY: Jessica, dial 911.\nJOHN-BOY:Jessica, I wouldn't do that if I were you.\nMarch parks just as Jessica runs towards them. John-Boys tackles her and throws the girl through the window besides the door.\nCut to OUTSIDE MARCH'S HOUSE\nJessica is thrown out the window, just as March and Healy have stopped outside the house\nMARCH:You hear that?\nThey see John-Boy walk in front of the house\nMARCH: Excuse me.\nJOHN-BOY:Evening.\nMARCH: You hear that sound just a second ago?\nJohn-Boy opens his car's trunk, goes down to get something\nJOHN-BOY:Oh, yeah, just now. That was me. [he rises again, wielding a Tommy Gun] I threw that little girl out the window.\nJohn-Boy fires the machine gun, hitting only the car as March and Healy take cover. Eventually his magazine is depleted\nMARCH: Cover me.\nAs March leaves, Healy shoots a pistol, hitting John Boy's car. John Boy reloads his tommy gun and fires again. Healy is forced to duck quickly.\nHEALY: God.\nWhile March keeps running back, John-Boy continues shooting, and Healy returns fire once the assassin's bullets stop again. When March gets near the door, he grabs Jessica and carries her. Healy starts running towards the house as John-Boy reloads, eventually hiding behind a generator under a palmtree.\nCut to INSIDE MARCH'S HOUSE\nMarch enters the house, carrying Jessica.\nMARCH: Holly!\nHolly rushes from a nearby room\nHOLLY: Dad!\nMarch points at a closet\nMARCH: Get in.\nHOLLY: Is she okay?\nMARCH:  Get down.\nOutside, Healy is hiding from John Boy's attack while taking bullets from his pocket. Back inside, as March and Holly approach the closet, Amelia comes out of it screaming\nAMELIA:Fucking fascists! (GASPS when he sees March with Jessica)\nMARCH: Jesus!\nAMELIA: (covering her mouth) Sorry.\nMARCH: (pointing forward) Get in.\nAmelia retreats into the closet, while March puts the unconscious Jessica in it and Holly enters as well.\nMARCH: Okay, come here. [he embraces Holly] Stay in here and don't move.\nHOLLY: Okay.\nHe closes the door\nMARCH: Okay. Okay.\nThe closet door opens, an arm carrying a handgun waving\nHOLLY: Wait, wait. Dad, Dad, here you go.\nMARCH:Jesus!\nThe startled March takes the gun\nOutside, John Boy stops firing again, March shoots, and  March comes in from the front door and does it too. John Boy looks into the trunk, grabs a pistol and fires it with one hand while shooting with the tommy gun in the other at the house, forcing March back in.\nCut to CLOSET\nJessica is rubbing her eyes while Amelia is getting up.\nHOLLY:Jessica. I think she's awake.\nAmelia moves towards the window\nHOLLY: Wait, where are you going? What are you doing?\nAMELIA: Tell Mr Healy thanks for nothing.\nshe jumps out the window\nCut to OUTSIDE\nJohn Boy now has an AK-47. He fires in the space between March and Healy, missing both but damaging the palm tree above the latter plentifully. The tree creaks, and just as it starts falling on the house, Healy runs towards the kitchen window, firing his last bullets at John Boy.\nCut to KITCHEN\nHealy GROANS after going through the window.\nHEALY: Fuck!\nBullets hit the kitchen as Healy searches for ammo. March enters.\nMARCH:Are you okay?\nHEALY: March, gun, gun!\nHe throws the gun... and hits the window, making it go through the glass\nHEALY: Fuck!\nMARCH:Shit!\n\nJohn Boy is still firing as March grabs the cookie jar and runs towards Healy. Once the shooting stops, he turns the jar around and gives bullets to Healy\nMARCH: Here.\nOutside, John Boy ran back to the car and shot with the pistol until he heard a SIREN WAILING.  He closes the trunk, and runs towards the wheel as Healy's shots hit his windshield. John Boy then runs away, TYRES SCREECHING. March rises from his crouched position...\nMARCH:He's gone.\n\n...and runs towards the closet. Holly gets out to see him.\nMARCH: He's gone.\nhe's PANTING, and then notices Jessica is awake\nMARCH:Hey.\nJessica gestures, looking both hurt and sleepy. March looks to both sides and then Holly points out the window. March goes to it, and Amelia is nowhere in sight.\nMARCH: Shit.\nJohn-Boy driving away, listening to a SIREN WAILING. Right in front of him, appears Amelia running.  She flags down the car, asking for help.\nJOHN-BOY:Wow.\nHe stops, Amelia leans on the open passenger door window.\nAMELIA:Please, I need to get out of here.\nGUNSHOT, a now dead Amelia falls on the street. John-Boy  leaves\nCut to OUTSIDE MARCH'S HOUSE\nA CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS, as a photographer takes a picture of Amelia's corpse, which then is covered by a blanket. Healy looks at it with a defeated look before walking along the police cars, while an equally desolate March stares at the horizon. Pan up, the sun starts rising\nCut to POLICE STATION, DAY\nMarch and Healy walk along with a cop in a suit.\nMARCH: She had her fucking daughter killed, Perry. Please tell me they're at least gonna question her.\nPERRY: They haven't and they're not going to.\nHEALY: Because?\nPERRY: Because she's the head of the Justice Department. Oh, and, by the way, you're welcome. (LAUGHS) You're out, free on your own recognisance. You get to walk. There should be like a statue of me in your fucking house. I'm sorry, guys. You're gonna lose this one, all right? Your word against hers. No evidence. You lose. You better seriously think about changing your story.\n\nCut to STREET\nAs \"A Horse with no Name\" plays, we see Holland, Holly and Healy in a taxi, stuck in traffic. They see the birds flying away...\nHEALY: Oh, fuck it.\nMARCH: Maybe they're right. Maybe the goddamn birds can't breathe.\nHEALY: Amelia, Misty, Dean, Shattuck, all dead. The rest of us just get to choke.\nHOLLY: (SIGHS) I need a drink.\n\nCut to OUTSIDE MARCH'S HOUSE\nThe cab stops by the house isolated with a police line.\nHEALY: How much do I owe you, buddy?\nCAB DRIVER: 12 bucks, pal.\nHOLLY: I always hated that palm tree.\nMARCH: Never trusted it.\n(Holly CHUCKLES)\nMARCH: Go inside and get your stuff.\nHOLLY:Okay.\nShe goes into the house.\nMARCH:We'll go stay in a hotel or something. We'll get room service.\nA car arrives. It's Mrs. Glenn.\nMRS. GLENN: Mr March.\nMARCH:Mrs Glenn.\nMRS. GLENN:I need to talk to you.\nMARCH:(CHUCKLING) What a wonderful surprise.\nMRS. GLENN:Is that your house?\nMARCH:We're remodelling. Listen, this isn't a great time.\nMRS. GLENN:It is a great time. He is supposed to be looking for my niece.\nHEALY: Really?\nMRS. GLENN:Because I saw her. But nobody believes me. Why will nobody believe me?\nHEALY:I'm sure I don't know, ma'am.\nMRS. GLENN:I saw her in her house through the front window as clear as day, writing something at a desk. She was wearing a blue pinstriped jacket.\nHEALY: I've seen that jacket, sure, yeah.\nMARCH: What do you mean, you saw that jacket?\nHEALY:In Shattuck's office. It was there with a bunch of other clothes.\nMARCH: That jacket was in Sid Shattuck's office?\nHEALY:Yeah. It was bagged up. It had Misty's name on it and the name of the movie.\nMARCH: It's wardrobe for the film. It's wardrobe for the film. Holy fucking shit.\nMRS. GLENN:Oh!\nMARCH: Sorry. Mrs Glenn, I need you to take us to Misty's house. I need you to show us exactly what you saw.\n\nCut to MISTY'S HOUSE, SUNSET\nThey park outside the house, Mrs. Glenn points at the window\nMRS GLENN: There. There. That's the window. I was coming around that corner and I saw her through that window.\nNow they're inside. Mrs. Glenn finds it different from the memory.\nMRS GLENN:But, no, it was here. The desk was here.\nHEALY: No desk there now.\nMarch is crawling on the floor.\nMRS GLENN: Well, I don't know what to say.\nHOLLY: Dad, what are you doing?\nMARCH: Give me a second.\nHe pushes a button under a table, with a WHIRRING noise it opens and reveals a projector.\nMARCH: World's worst detective, huh? You did see your niece, Mrs Glenn. You saw her on that wall, at a desk, in a pinstriped suit.\nHEALY: So what she saw was a movie?\nMARCH: Not a movie. The movie. The movie.\nHEALY: But the film burned up.\nMARCH:Well, how did she see it two days after it supposedly burned up? And the wardrobe matches perfectly.\nHEALY: So Amelia had a second print? She had a copy?\nMARCH:Wouldn't you?\nHOLLY: And she gave that copy to Misty. So she comes here, checks the film against that wall...\nMARCH:Lily sees it through that window.\nHOLLY: And Amelia splits and takes the film.\nHEALY: And goes where?\nMARCH:Oh, for fuck... I mean, can't we get to the next...\nHEALY: The Western Hotel to meet the businessman.\nMARCH:Distributors. She was screening it for the distributors. She was showing them the film. It's out there. The film exists. Now we just have to find it.\nHolly finds a note on the floor.\nHOLLY: Guys, look. \"Opening night, 9:00 p.m.\" Signed, Chet.\nMARCH: Fucking Chet.\nHEALY: The protestor guy?\nMARCH:Give me that shit. [she gives him the note] She was planning something with Chet. Opening night?\nHOLLY:The LA auto show. It's today, right?\nHEALY: Yeah. Big party. Mucky-mucks. Loads of press. If you wanted to get a story out there, right?\nMARCH: And fucking Chet's a projectionalist.\nMRS GLENN: Please stop talking. I've been listening to everything you said. Does this mean... Does this mean that my niece is dead?\nMARCH: Yes! I mean, you know, yes.\nMrs. Glenn gets sad, Holly sighs.\nMARCH: She was murdered. I'm sorry.\nJACKSON: Mmm-hmm.\nHOLLY: But we're gonna bring down the people who did it.\nMARCH: Yeah, and for a deeply discounted rate, so...\n\nCut to CAR EXPO\nTelevision footage of the vehicles showcased at the expo.\nMC: Welcome to Los Angeles and the 1978 Pacific Coast Auto Show.

[a man points to a nearby door] You seen Chet, the projectionist?\nGUY: Yeah, he just left like 10 minutes ago, went for a drink. And you are?\nMARCH: In a hurry.\nHEALY: Thanks, buddy.\nBUDDY: How'd you know my name was Buddy?\nHealy is lockpicking the door, with Holly warning him the surroundings are clear. He opens, and both men  go through.\nCut to EXPO\nWOMAN (VO): The Malibu sedan. This year's edition is looking spectacular. Come and see it, folks.\nLots of fancy people walk around the expo cars, including Bergen Paulsen, the executive interviewed on that report March watched in the bathtub.\nCut to PROJECTION ROOM\nHealy is checking the film reels.\nHEALY: It's just a bunch of cars. Motor City Pride. That's not it.\nMARCH: Shit.\nHEALY: That's not the film.\nMarch looks below the open film can before searching elsewhere.\nMARCH: Fucking Chet. He's probably still got it stashed somewhere.\nTally enters with a  gun, Holly tries to follow but  the door is closed in her face. The men turn to see Tally, the new person, who cocks her gun to point at both.\nMARCH: Tally. Oh, my God, you look incredible. How do you get your hair to... It's magnificent. (STUTTERS, as Healy gives a negative look) Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but there's been some foul play. Do you know that that suitcase that you gave us, somebody switched it out. There was no money in it.\nHealy facepalms.\nTALLY: (CHUCKLES) No shit. Weapons on the floor. Now.\nHEALY:(SIGHS) I guess you killed the projectionist, huh?\nHealy tosses his gun to the ground. March does the same\nTALLY: No. My associate's out looking for him now. We'll find him.\nHEALY:Tally, let me ask you something. You ever really killed anybody?\nTALLY: In Detroit, yeah. Three times.\nHEALY:Really?\nTALLY: That's where this all started. The Detroit show. That bitch Misty shooting her mouth off about her new movie.\nMARCH:Tally, this is not you. You're not a murderer.\nHEALY:She just said she killed three people.\nMARCH:I know, but I'm saying deep down.\nHEALY:Hey, look, one's a mistake. By the time you get to three...\nMARCH:Don't paint her with that brush. I guess it's easy to live in your world, right, where everyone sits in their place.\nHEALY:See what's in front of you. She's got a gun and she's killed three...\nMARCH:Come on, man. You don't know her upbringing.\nHEALY:You gotta face the situation.\nMARCH:You don't know what she...\n(KNOCKING ON DOOR)\nHOLLY: Room service.\nMarch gets on the floor, starts searching through Healy's ankles\nMARCH:Shit. No.\nTALLY: What's wrong with him?\nHEALY:I... I don't know. I'm gonna ask him. March?\nMARCH:Yeah?\nHEALY:Uh, what the fuck are you doing?\nMARCH:Did you move it?\nHEALY:Move what?\nMARCH:The fucking gun.\nHEALY:What gun?\nMARCH:The fucking ankle gun.\nHEALY:Who told you I had an ankle gun?\nMARCH:You did. In the car before we crashed. You were like, \"Oh, check out my ankle gun.\" You know, you showed me your ankle gun.\nHEALY:Come on. Are you serious?Are you fucking serious?\nMARCH:Oh, shit.\nHEALY:Yeah.\nMARCH:Did I dream that?\nHEALY:Yeah, you moron, you dreamt it.\nMARCH:No, no, no, no.

Holly, you can come in now.\nShe opens the door, Holly enters, pushing a food trolley.\nTALLY: (CHUCKLES) Very clever, Holly.\nHOLLY: Thanks. I thought so.\n(Holly throws coffee in Tally's face, she GASPS)\nTALLY: Why did you just throw cold coffee on me?\nHOLLY: I got it in the hallway. I thought it was hot.\nMARCH: I like where your head's at, sweetheart. That really could have worked out.\nTALLY:All right, you know, everybody, in the corner.\nCome on.\nTally ends up slipping on the poured coffee, YELPS...\nTALLY:Shit!\n...and falls, , pulling the trigger to hit a window whileknocking herself unconscious\nMARCH: Well, that really worked out.\nHEALY: Yeah.\nThey get their guns back, while Healy also disarms Tally.\nMARCH:Now we just gotta find that fucking Chet before John Boy does.\nHEALY: Yeah. Well, that guy said he was going for a drink. You take the roof bar. I'll take downstairs.Well done, kiddo.\nHOLLY:Thanks.\nAs they leave, March puts a cushion under Tally's head, and even pats her before going\nCut to DOWNSTAIRS BAR\nJohn-Boy walks to Chet, who is drinking in the bar counter.\nJOHN-BOY: You the projectionist?\nCHET: Mmm-hmm. (CLEARS THROAT)\nJOHN-BOY: Look, we got a problem on nine. Someone knocked over the projector. The film's all over the floor.\nCHET: Film's on the floor? Really?\nJOHN-BOY: Yeah, it's a mess. You follow me?\nChet takes a last sip before getting up to follow him.\nCut to UPSTAIRS BAR\n\"Escape (The Pi\u00f1a Colada Song)\" is PLAYING in the fancy location, as the ELEVATOR DINGS.

In the bar, March eventually grabs a snack near the counter, earning him the notice of...\nBARTENDER:Hey, pal, what can I do you for? [March gestures negatively] Free drinks. What do you have?\nMarch turns  with a more interested look.\nCut to STORAGE ROOM\nHealy is questioning a janitor.\nHEALY: Little guy, stringy hair.\nJANITOR: [pointing] I think they went out through those doors.\nHealy walks out to a backyard full of empty containers.\nHEALY: Hey, Chet? Chet?\nHealy hears CHET MOANING, which is emerging from a garbage can where the bloodied projectionist lies.\nHEALY: Hey. Hey, Chet.\n(CHET MOANS)\nHEALY: Amelia's film, where is it?\n\nCut to EXPO\nJOHN-BOY: (to a walkie-talkie) The film is in the projector. Repeat, it's in the projector.\n\nCut to UPSTAIRS BAR\nOlder Guy is responding in a table right behind where Holly is. She notes the conversation is interesting...\nOLDER GUY: (to walkie-talkie) But we already checked that.\n\n\nCut to STORAGE ROOM\nCHET: Spliced in.\nHEALY:What?\n\nCut to EXPO\nJOHN-BOY: [looking upwards to the projection room] It's spliced into the middle of it, right in the other film. Go get it.\n\nCut to UPSTAIRS BAR\nOLDER GUY:On my way.\nHolly tries following him, the ELEVATOR DINGS... and the Older Guy turns, noticing his pursuer.\nOLDER GUY:Don't you know it's rude to eavesdrop?\nOlder Guy brings Holly next to the now clearly wasted March in the bar counter.\nOLDER GUY:I got a gun pointed directly at your daughter's spine. Come with me. (to Holly) Come on, baby.\nThey step back, March puts on his shades and turns around to see both. He then starts VOCALISING\nMARCH: How does that song go?\nHolly SIGHS in disbelief\nCut to PROJECTION ROOM\nA timer DINGS, the projector turns on\nCut to EXPO\nThe movie is now being projected onto a film screen, as John-Boy turns around to learn.\nNARRATOR: Welcome, Los Angeles, to the finest fleet of automobiles Detroit has to offer, giving the world luxury redefined.

It's  sleazy footage, with a women moaning with the text \"A Savage Sid Shattuck production\" appears. After that comes Misty Mountains topless along with the credits \"Misty Mountains In\" and \"How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy?\"\nPAULSEN: Oh, my God.\n\n\nCut to ROOF\nMARCH: Fuck, fuck.\nOLDER GUY: Do you want her to see you like this?\n(MARCH CONTINUES CRYING)\nOLDER GUY: You fucking drunk. Oh, don't start that crying shit.\nMARCH:I fucked up.\nOLDER GUY: You drunk motherfucker, you.\nMARCH:I love you.\nOLDER GUY:  It's embarrassing.\nMARCH:I'm sorry. Duck.\nHOLLY: What?\nMARCH: [taking off his shades] Duck.\nHe punches the Older Guy.\nOLDER GUY: Motherfucker!\nOlder Guy goes for March, who is going for his gun. March punches him again beforing shooting Older Guy in the chest, who in response tries pulling Holly along as he falls down the edge; March tackles him, he lets her go. Both are falling towards the pool, Older Guy bloodily splats on the ground while March hits the water.\nCut to EXPO\nPORN ACTOR: Well, I'm Bulging Paulsen and I represent the Detroit auto manufacturers. That's who the hell I am.\nPaulsen himself is disgusted, as all the other patrons give an \"Oooh\" reaction he walks away.\nMISTY: You poison our air. The people won't stand for it.\nAngry John-Boy also walks out.\nCut to POOL\nMarch is down the water, seemingly about to pass out, when something makes him get an amused look.\nMARCH: Nixon! [he sees \"Tricky Dick\" inside the pool] No!\nHe GRUNTS and starts swimming away and out the water.\nCut to EXPO\nJohn Boy keeps on walking in the expo as the movie plays. He then turns to find the projector room...\nMISTY: (O.S.) I might be persuaded to change my mind. Perhaps if we came to a monetary arrangement. I'll take a wire transfer. It's a Union Federal account. Number 22-12. Just tell them the exact amounts.\n...and John-Boy tries shooting at the projector, while everyone else starts SCREAMING and running away in panic\n-He's got a gun!\n\nCut to POOL\nMarch is now floating in the pool, listening to gun shots before a spinning car nearby explodes.\nCut to PROJECTION ROOM\nThe bullets have hit the projector, and both the falling glass and the fire alarm wake up Tally.\nCut to POOL\nMarch now goes for the pool ladder to leave.\nCut to EXPO\nNearby, Healy has returned, and tries dodging the running people. He eventually sees March getting in the expo, and trying to shoot John-Boy, hitting the glasses near him. John-Boy crouches and tries to shoot March, who rolls over a spinning Chevrolet which is hit.\nMARCH: Oh, my God.\nMarch is BREATHING DEEPLY, preparing his next strike, when John-Boy turns around and notices he is against a car in spinning platform.\nMARCH: Three, two, one.\nMarch gets up, also sees he's spinning. John-Boy shoots, hits the rearviewmirrors next to March.\nMARCH:Jesus!\nHe falls down and starts crawling away. Healy shoots and hits the lamp near John-Boy, who cowers back. Both men keep on firing until John-Boy is out of bullets, and March is next to Healy.\nHEALY: How'd you get down here? I told you to go to the roof. Did you fall?\nMARCH: Yeah.\nMarch prepares his gun as John-Boy fires again, hitting the car between the men.\nHEALY: Jesus Christ, are you kidding?\nMARCH: I think I'm invincible. It's the only thing that makes sense. I don't think I can die.\nHEALY: Where's the film?\nMARCH: It's up there. We just gotta go get it.\nThe camera pans up back to the projector room...\nCut to PROJECTION ROOM\n...where Holly has just entered, and is seeing Tally holding a pair of scissors in front of the projector table. Tally sees Holly, and throws the scissors, which as Holly ducks quickly are impaled into the door. Once she rises up again, Holly runs for the table, eventually being grabbed by Tally in the shoulder.\nTALLY: You get out of here, you little shit.\nHOLLY kicks Tally in the knee, and she SCREAMS falling to the ground, releasing Holly, who goes on to grab the film can. Tally rises up as Holly is holding the can in front of her.\nTALLY: You give me that, you fucked-up little hippy.\nHOLLY: You want it? Go get it.\nHolly tosses the uptight can, making it roll like a wheel.\nTALLY: No!\nTally tries getting it, but it's too late: the can rolls and falls down the window\nCut to EXPO\nClose-ups of March, Healy and eventually Paulsen with two thugs behind him seeing the can falling. Once it hits the ground, it bounces until it stops by the car that exploded.\nPAULSEN:Get me that fucking film. Move it.\nThe thugs leave, and then we see March doing the same.\nMARCH: Cover me.\nHEALY (O.S.): What? March, March , March!\nMarch runs through the lobby, John Boy sees him and takes aim, with March returning fire. Then someone approaches John-Boy from behind.\nGUARD: Drop your weapon!\nJohn Boy punches the guy and shoots another guard that approaches. Paulsen's people run through the lobby, Healy tackles two of them, throwing them on the ground. March finds the film can near a fire, tries to grab it and instantly drops the hot can.\nMARCH: Fuck.\nHealy is punching the two thugs, and then turns around to talk to March\nHEALY: March, go. I got this.\nMarch wraps the movie can in some cloth, grabs it and runs away as Healy continues fighting the thugs. He passes by John Boy finishing off the guard, by punching him more and then shooting him. He then turns, seeing March leaving...\nCut to CONVENTION ROOM\n...March runs down the escalator, jumps off it into a table, which flips and drops him on the floor. Luckily, March also misses being shot by John Boy as he's picking himself up. March runs, another bullet hits the wall next to March, and when he turns around a bit, John Boy hits right in the film can, the impact pushing March into the window behind him. He breaks the window, and while falling the can slips from his hands. March crawls after the rolling can as it falls down the balcony....\nCut to ENTRANCE\n...crashing through a glass ceiling atop a car below. Sliding to stand on the street, March is hit by one of Paulsen's men, who runs towards the can and grabs it. Just as March gets near the guy, bullets hit near him.\nCut to BALCONY\nIt's John Boy in a nearby balcony.\nHEALY: Hey!\nJohn Boy turns to see who yelled, it's Healy, who jumps on him, making John Boy drop his gun.\nCut to ENTRANCE\nDown on the street, March is running when a taxi passenger opens his door, pushing March towards a nearby car.\nPASSENGER: Hey!\nAfter hitting the parked car, March is hit by a moving one. The driver honks and screams as March rolls and falls with his back at the windshield. Eventually March sees the man with the film and runs towards him. He grabs him by the shoulder, then in the waist.\nMAN: Run! Just run!\n\nCut to BALCONY\nHealy and John Boy keep on fighting. When Healy flips John Boy over, he sees a grenade pin around his finger. As he runs away, John Boy is struggling to takes off his jacket.\nCut to ENTRANCE\nThe thug attacked by March finally lets the can loose. Another one of Paulsen's men goes out the door at tries shooting at March, hitting a nearby car. Eventually John-Boy's jacket falls on this thug's arm, exploding.\nCut to BALCONY\nJohn Boy jumps back at the flames rise from the street, and is tackled by Healy.   Holly comes by the door, sees Healy atop John-Boy, choking him.\nHOLLY: Mr Healy, what are you doing?\nHEALY: Go away, Holly.\nHOLLY: Healy, stop. You don't have to kill him.\nJohn Boy tries fighting back, but fails.\nHOLLY: Mr Healy, if you kill this man, I will never speak to you again.\nHealy turns to stare at Holly...\nCut to ENTRANCE\nDown on the street March tumbles towards the can. As he grabs it, the message on his hand now reads something different as one word is smudged : \"YOU WILL BE HAPPY\". He GROANS.\nCut to BALCONY\n...and lets off of John Boy's throat. He COUGHS\nHEALY: Congratulations, buddy. You owe your life to a 13-year-old girl.\nHealy then punches him unconscious. Holly approaches Healy. Down in the street, March holds up the film can in triumph. Healy gets up, Holly smiles. Afterwards, March extends the pinky from his broken hand to Holly. She replies with the same gesture. March sits on the sidewalk, his back towards a parked car. On the balcony, Healy pats Holly in the head.\nHEALY: Come on, let's go down and see your dad.\nThey walk back inside\nCut to ENTRANCE\nThe SIRENS WAIL.\nMARCH: And that would be the cops.\nMarch grabs a cigarette as the police cars park in front of the hotel. The cops from the first car go for him as March lights the cigarette.\nOFFICER: Sir? Sir, are you all right? Sir, is anyone left in the building?\nOFFICER 2: He's not responsive.\nOFFICER: All right, let's find out who else is...\nMARCH:(VO): And sometimes, sometimes... You just win.\n\nCut to DEPT. OF JUSTICE\nMarch and Healy are sitting in the reception's chairs. Healy then sees Judith is approaching...\nHEALY: Jesus Christ. Oh, shit.\nMARCH: You know what? Don't even talk to her. Don't even look at her, man.\nMarch puts on his shades just as Judith sits in chairs backing them.\nMARCH: Fuck.\nJUDITH: Oh, boys, boys. You really think you got something done here. Do you have a clue what just happened? It was protocol. I followed protocol.\n(MARCH SPEAKING FAKE GERMAN)\nJUDITH:What's wrong with him?\nHEALY: I believe he's making a connection between you and Adolf Hitler.\nJUDITH: Read the fucking newspaper. What's good for Detroit is good for America.\nHEALY: Unbelievable.\nJUDITH:The America I love owes its life to the Big Three.\nHEALY:But it's all right for you to fail your daughter?\nJUDITH:Detroit had her killed.\nMARCH: I think I read about that. The whole city got together, took a vote. Big turnout.\nJUDITH:I wanted her safe. That's why I hired you two.\nHEALY:You're going to jail, Mrs Kuttner.\nJUDITH:I might be going to jail, but it won't make a difference. You can't take Detroit down.And if I'm not there to take care of it, someone else will be.\nMARCH: Okay. Well, we shall see.\n\nCut to STREET\n(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING as March drives to a bar. It's Christmas season,and a Santa Claus is on the street)\nSANTA: Merry Christmas, everybody. Merry Christmas!\nCut to BAR\nInside the bar, March finds Holly besides the doorstep.\nMARCH: Jesus. Where is he?\nHolly points offscreen. Healy is smoking a cigar at the bar counter. March takes a seat besides him.\nMARCH: Scotch.\nHEALY: Did you see the TV?\nMARCH:Yeah, I saw.\nHEALY: They're gonna let them off,the car companies, scot-free. Not enough evidence of collusion, you see.\nMARCH:I heard.\nHEALY: The sun went up, the sun went down. Nothing changes, just like you said.\nMARCH:Look, they got away with it. Big surprise, you know?(SIGHS) People are stupid. But they're not that stupid. The point is five years tops, we're all driving electric cars from Japan, anyway. Mark my words. Look at this. [grabs his tie] You ever see the bad-breath tie? [EXHALES on the tie, then puts in front of Healy's mouth] Breathe on it.\nHealy giggles, then exhales, leading the tie to shrivel. Healy laughs.\nMARCH: Works every time. Kills Holly. At least you're drinking again.\nHEALY:Yeah. I feel great.\nMARCH:You know, nobody got hurt.\nHEALY:A few people got hurt.\nMARCH:I'm saying I think they died quickly, though, so I don't think that they got hurt. [takes out a newspaper] Look at this.\nHe shows an ad featuring caricatures of both, 'The Nice Guys Agency'\nMARCH:I'm sorry you look Filipino.\nHEALY:I do. Or I look Mexican.\nMARCH:And we already got our first case. Old lady in Glendale.\nHEALY:Mmm-hmm.\nMARCH:Thinks her husband's sleeping with Lynda Carter.\nHEALY:Wonder Woman?\nMARCH:Or Lynda Carter. That's what we have to figure out.\nHEALY:Right.\nMARCH:But he's 82, so it's time-sensitive. What do you say?\nA bee is BUZZING on the counter.\nMARCH: Shit.\nTries to hit the bee with the paper, then CLEARS THROAT. Healy gets a drink bottle to toast with March's scotch glass.\nMARCH: To the birds.\nHEALY: Hallelujah.\nMarch sips from the glass, Healy chugs straight from the bottle.\nEND CREDITS1Embed"},

They will need\nattending to.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nNot to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper\nHagrid's more than capable of seeing\nto them.\n\nMADAME MAXIME\nBut you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink\nonly single malt whiskey.\n\nThe man seated next to Hagrid yelps. Hagrid has stabbed a fork\ninto his hand.\n\nMAN\nYou idiot!\n\n\nINT. ASSEMBLY ROOM\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nYour attention please! I would like\nto say a few words. Eternal glory, that\nis what awaits the student who wins\nthe tri-wizard tournament. But to do\nthis that student must survive three\ntasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.\n\n\nFRED\nWicked.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nFor this reason the ministry has seen\nfit to impose a new rule. To explain\nall this we have the head of the department\nof international magic cooperation Mister\nBartimus Crouch.\n\nThunder roars overhead, rain begins leaking through the roof\nand screams break out. A strange man stands in the doorway, he\ncasts some magic upwards and seals the roof. Peace is restored.\n\n\nRON\nBloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.\n\nHERMIONE\nAlastor Moody? The aura.\n\nRON\nHe was a catcher. Half the cells in\nAzkaban are full thanks to him. He's\nsupposed to be mad as a hatter though\nthese days.\n\nThis character enters the room and begins walking. We see Harry\nthrough his mechanical eye. He limps, breathing heavily as he\ngoes.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nMy dear old friend, thanks for coming.\n\n\nMAD-EYE\nThat stupid roof.\n\nMad-Eye takes a drink.\n\nPUPIL\nWhat's that he's drinking do you suppose?\n\n\nHARRY\nI don't know but I don't think it's\nPumpkin Juice.\n\nBARTY\nAfter much deliberation the ministry\nhas concluded that for their own safety\nno student under the age of seventeen\nshall be allowed to put forth their\nname for the tri-wizard tournament.\nThis decision is final.\n\nThe crowd is unsettled, people are booing.\n\nGEORGE\nThat's rubbish! You don't know what\nyou're doing!\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nSilence!\n\nDumbledore casts magic over a box which melds into a goblet containing\na blue flame.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nThe goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to\nsubmit themselves for the tournament\nmerely write their name upon a piece\nof parchment and throw it in the flame\nbefore this hour on Thursday night.\nDo not do so lightly, if choosen there's\nno turning back. As from this moment\nthe tri-wizard tournament has begun.\n\n\n\nINT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT\n\nWe see a suspicious character enter the room where the goblet\nis still burning and close the door behind him.\n\n\nINT. CLASSROOM\n\nMAD-EYE\nAlastor Moody.\n\nHe writes his name on the board.\n\nMAD-EYE\nMinistry malcontent. And your new defence\nagainst the dark arts teacher. I'm here\nbecause Dumbledore asked me, end of\nstory, goodbye, the end. Any questions?\nWhen it comes to the dark arts, I believe\nin a practical approach. But first,\nwhich of you can tell me how many unforgivable\ncurses there are?\n\nHERMIONE\nThree sir.\n\nMAD-EYE\nAnd they are so named?\n\nHERMIONE\nBecause they are unforgivable. Use of\nany one of them will...\n\nMAD-EYE\nWill earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban.\nCorrect. Now the ministry says you're\ntoo young to see what these curses do.\nI say different! You need to know what\nyou're up against, you need to be prepared,\nyou need to find somewhere else to put\nyour chewing gum other than the underside\nof your desk Mr Finnigan!\n\nPUPIL\nAw no way, the old codger can see out\nthe back of his head.\n\nMad-Eye throws the chalk in anger.\n\nMAD-EYE\nSo, which curse shall we see first?\nWEASLEY!\n\nRON\nYes...\n\nMAD-EYE\nGive us a curse.\n\nRON\nWell, my dad did tell me about one...\nThe imperious curse.\n\nMAD-EYE\nAhhh yes, your father would know all\nabout that. Gave the ministry quite\na bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps\nthis will show you why.\n\nMad-Eye pops open a jar with a spider in it.\n\nMAD-EYE\nHello. What a little beauty.\n\nHe uses his wand to send it around the class.\n\nMAD-EYE\nDon't worry. Completely harmless.\n\nThe class is unsettled.\n\nMAD-EYE\nBut if she bites... she's lethal!\n\nDraco laughs.\n\nMAD-EYE\nWhat are you laughing at?\n\nMad-Eye sends the spider onto Draco's face.\n\nMAD-EYE\nTalented isn't she? What shall I have\nher do next? Jump out the window? Drown\nherself?\n\nMad-Eye has the spider over a bucket of water, it's wriggling.\n\n\nMAD-EYE\nScores of witches and wizards have claimed\nthat they only do did you-know-whose\nbidding under the influence of the imperious\ncurse. But here's the rub, how do we\nsort out the liars? Another.. another..\nCome on come on. Longbottom is it? Up.\n\n\nNeville Longbottom stands.\n\nMAD-EYE\nProfessor Sprout tells me you have an\naptitude for herbology.\n\nNEVILLE\nThere's the um... The cruciatus curse.\n\n\nMAD-EYE\nCorrect! Correct! come come. Particularly\nnasty. The torture curse.\n\nMad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals.\n\n\nHERMIONE\nStop it! Can't you see it's bothering\nhim, stop it!\n\nMad-Eye stops. Neville is disturbed. Mad-Eye picks up the spider\nwhich is still making a noise.\n\nMAD-EYE\nPerhaps you could give us the last unforgivable\ncurse Miss Granger.\n\nHermione shakes her head. He casts a spell and the spider disintegrates.\n\n\nMAD-EYE\nThe killing curse. Only one person is\nknown to have survived it. And he's\nsitting in this room.\n\nHe approaches Harry's desk and takes a drink.\n\n\nINT. STAIRS\n\nRON\nBrilliant isn't he! Completely demented\nof course. Terrifying to be in the same\nroom with, he's really BEEN there you\nknow.\n\nHERMIONE\nThere's a reason those curses are unforgivable,\nand to perform them in a classroom.\nI mean did you see Neville's face.\n\n\nThey see a boy on the stairs facing the window.\n\nHERMIONE\nNeville?\n\nMad-Eye approaches Neville and pats him on the shoulder.\n\nMAD-EYE\nSon. You alright?\n\nNeville nods.\n\nMAD-EYE\nCome on, we'll have a cup of tea. I\nwant to show you something.\n\n\nINT. GOBLET ROOM\n\nOlder students are placing their names into the flame and others\nare applauding, Cedric is one of them.\n\nRON\nEternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't\nit?

And why's that Granger.\n\nHERMIONE\nYou see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore\ndrew it himself.\n\nFRED\nSo?\n\nHERMIONE\nSo a genius like Dumbledore couldn't\npossibly be fooled by something pathetically\ndimwitted such as an age potion.\n\nGEORGE\nThat's why it's so brilliant.\n\nGEORGE\nReady Fred?\n\nFRED\nReady George?\n\nThey jump inside the age line, and cheer. They put their names\nin the flame and do a high-five. The flame fires up and they're\nflung across the room onto the floor. When they get up they have\nfull heads of grey hair and beards.\n\nGEORGE\nYou said..\n\nFred You said..\n\nThey roll around fighting on the floor and the crowd cheer. The\nroom suddenly becomes silent as Viktor Krum walks in and puts\nhis name in the flame. He looks at Hermione and she smiles.\n\n\n\nINT. GOBLET ROOM - THURSDAY NIGHT\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nSit down please. And now the moment\nyou've all been waiting for, the champions\nselection!\n\nDumbledore approaches the blue flame and it glows red.

Another name comes out.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nThe champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur\nDelacour\n\nThe Beauxbatons girls cheer as Fleur walks up. Another name comes\nout.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nThe Hogwarts champion...

Only one will hoist this\nchalice of champions, this vessel of\nvictory the tri-wizard cup!\n\nPeople cheer, but the goblet glows red once more and another\nname flies out.

Offer him up as bait? Potter\nis a boy not a piece of meat.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nI agree with Severus. Alastor, keep\nan eye on Harry will you?\n\nMAD-EYE\nI can do that.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nDon't let him know though, he must be\nanxious enough as it is... knowing what\nlies ahead.

Did you or did\nyou not put your name into the goblet\nof fire?\n\nHARRY\nNo!\n\nSIR\nShh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about\nthis dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail\nand Voldemort, but who was the third\nman in the room?\n\nHARRY\nI dunno.\n\nSIR\nYou didn't hear a name?\n\nHARRY\nNo. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a\njob to do.

Look Harry,\nthe deatheaters at the world cup, your\nname rising from that goblet these are\nnot just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't\nsafe any more.\n\nHARRY\nWhat are you saying?\n\nSIR\nI'm saying the devils are inside the\nwalls.

He sends it up the\ntrouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable.\nEveryone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry and he laughs.\nEventually it comes back out and McGonagall turns Draco back\nto normal.\n\nDRACO\nMy father will hear about this!\n\nMAD-EYE\nIs that a threat!\n\nDraco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him.\n\nMAD-EYE\nI could tell you stories about your\nfather that would curl even your greasy\nhair boy!

HOGWARTS SKY\n\nHarry is flying at high speed around the Hogwarts buildings.\nThe dragon cuts him off and whips him off his broom, he lands\non the roof of Hogwarts, hanging on for dear life. The dragon\nis clambering across the roof, strewing tiles as it goes. Harry\nreaches his broom but it's stuck. He jerks it loose and lets\ngo of the roof just in time before the dragon swipes at him.\nHe falls a long way but regains control. He flies on to an area\nwith a bridge, he flies through a gap in the bridge but the dragon\ncrashes into it and falls into the water.\n\n\nINT. ARENA\n\nThe crowds are mostly silent.

A BRIDGE OUTSIDE HOGWARTS\n\nHERMIONE\nHarry you told me you'd figured the\negg out weeks ago. The task is two days\nfrom now.\n\nHARRY\nReally? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's\nalready figured it out.\n\nHERMIONE\nI wouldn't know, we didn't actually\ntalk about the tournament. Actually\nwe didn't really talk at all, Viktor's\nmore of a physical being. I just mean\nhe's not particularly... Mostly he watches\nme study. It's a bit annoying actually.\nYou are trying to figure this egg out\naren't you?\n\nHARRY\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\n\nHERMIONE\nI mean these tasks are supposed to test\nyou, in the most brutal way they're\nalmost cruel. And um, I'm scared for\nyou.

Kicked the habit.\nMyrtle, did you say try putting it in\nthe water?\n\nMyrtle flies around again and gets in the water.\n\nMYRTLE\nWell. That's what he did. The other\nboy, the handsome one. Cedric.\n\nHarry takes the egg and puts it under the water.\n\nMYRTLE\nWell go on, open it.\n\nHarry does so and goes underwater himself. He hears a voice singing.\n\n\nVOICE SINGING\nCome seek us where our voices sound.\nWe cannot sing above the ground. An\nhour long you'll have to look, to recover\nwhat we took.\n\nHARRY\nMyrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the\nblack lake are there?\n\nMYRTLE\nAhhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to\nriddle it out.

The three\nof us can figure it out.\n\nMad-Eye Moody appears in the doorway.\n\nMAD-EYE\nHate to break up this scholar session\nbut Professor McGonagall would like\nto see you in her office. Not you Potter,\njust Weasly and Granger.\n\nHERMIONE\nBut sir, the second task is only hours\naway and...\n\nMAD-EYE\nExactly.

Do you know there's a\nwizard in Nepal whose growing gravity\nresistant trees?\n\nHARRY\nNeville. No offense, but I really don't\ncare about plants.

Where are they anyway?\n\n\nNEVILLE\nYou seem a little tense Harry.\n\nHARRY\nDo I?\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n(Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the\nsecond task. Last night something was\nstolen from each of our champions. A\ntreasure of sorts. These four treasures,\none for each champion, now lie on the\nbottom of the black lake. In order to\nwin each champion need only find their\ntreasure and return to the surface.\nSimple enough. Except for this, they\nwill have one hour to do so and one\nhour only. After that they'll be on\ntheir own.\n\nMAD-EYE\n(To Harry) Put that in your mouth.\n\n\nHarry puts the gilliweed in his mouth and starts choking.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n(Continued) You may begin at the start\nof the cannon.\n\nThe cannon fires and the champions enter the water, three of\nthem dive in while Harry is pushed.

Viktor and Hermione\nnext, the crows chants 'Krum, Krum, Krum'. The Beauxbatons girls\nlook worried.\n\n\nEXT.

He's attacked and gets held down,\nhe pushes Ron and the girl towards the surface.\n\n\nEXT. ABOVE WATER\n\nRon and the girl come up, they are coughing but safe.

There was a Rosier,\nEvan Rosier.\n\nBARTY\nMr Rosier is dead.\n\nIGOR\nDead?\n\nMAD-EYE\n(To Dumbledore) Yeah took a piece of\nme with him though didn't he.\n\nMad-Eye points to his mechanical eye.\n\nIGOR\nI didn't know.\n\nBARTY\nIf that is all the witness has to offer...\n\n\nIGOR\nNo! No! There was Rookwood, he was a\nspy.\n\nBARTY\nAugustus Rookwood? Of the department\nof ministries.\n\nIGOR\nYa ya, the same. He passed information\nto you know who from inside the ministry\nitself.\n\nBARTY\nVery well. Counsel will deliberate.\nIn the meantime you will be returned\nto Azkaban.\n\nIGOR\nNO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape,\nSeverus Snape.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nThe counsel is very much aware you have\ngiven evidence on this matter. Severus\nSnape was indeed a deatheater and prior\nto Lord Voldemort's downfall turned\nspy for us at great personal risk. Today\nhe's no more a deatheater than I am.\n\n\nIgor protests loudly.\n\nIGOR\nIt's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful\nto the dark lord.\n\nBARTY\nSilence!\n\nBarty hits the gavel repeatedly.\n\nBARTY\nUnless the witness possesses any name\nof genuine consequence this session\nis now concluded.\n\nIGOR\nOh no no no no no. I heard about one\nmore.\n\nBARTY\nWhat's that?\n\nIGOR\nThe name...\n\nBARTY\nYes?\n\nIGOR\nI know for a fact this person took part\nin the capture, and by means of the\ncruciatus curse, torture of the aurer\nFrank Longbottom and...\n\nBARTY\nThe name! Give me the wretched name!\n\n\nIGOR\nBarty Crouch! ... Junior.\n\nBarty Crouch junior begins to run. Mad-Eye zaps him with magic,\nhe falls into the center of the court. The crowd is in uproar.\nGuards seize Barty junior.\n\nBARTY JR\nGet your hands off me you pathetic little\nmen. Hello father.\n\nBARTY\nYou are no son of mine.\n\nBARTY JR\nGAHHHH!\n\nHarry steps out of the blue pool and we're back in the darkened\nroom.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nCuriosity's not a sin Harry, but you\nshould exercise caution. It's a pensieve,\nuseful if like me you find your mind\na wee bit stretched. It allows me to\nsee what small things I've already seen.\nYou see Harry I've searched and searched\nfor something, some small detail. Something\nI might have overlooked, something that\nwould explain why these terrible things\nhave happened. Every time I get close\nto an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.\n\n\nHARRY\nSir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened\nto him?\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nHe was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty\nto do it. But he had no choice, the\nevidence was overwhelming. Why do you\nask?\n\nHARRY\nIt's just that I had a dream about him.\nIt was in the summer, before school.\nIn the dream I was in a house and Voldemort\nwas there only he wasn't quite human,\nand Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's\nson.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nHave there been other dreams like this?\n\n\nHARRY\nYes. Always the same one. Sir... these\ndreams, what I see, you don't think\nit's actually happening do you?\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nI think it's unwise for you to linger\nover these dreams Harry, I think it's\nbest that you simply...\n\nDumbledore puts up his wand and pulls a quivering string of magic\nout from his head.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nCast them away.\n\n\nINT. CORRIDOR\n\nHarry is walking along, we hear raised voices from inside the\nherbs store.\n\nIGOR\nIt's a sign Severus, you know what it\nmeans as well as I.\n\nThe door opens and they see Harry. He looks at them. Igor leaves.\n\n\nSEVERUS\nPotter! What's your hurry? Congratulations,\nyour performance in the black lake was\ninspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?\n\n\nHARRY\nYes sir.\n\nSEVERUS\nIngenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed,\nnot something found in your every day\ngarden. Nor is this, know what it is?\n\n\nHARRY\nBubble juice sir?\n\nSEVERUS\nVeritaserum. Three drops of this and\nyou-know-who himself will spill his\ndarkest secrets. The use of this on\na student is regrettably forbidden,\nhowever should you ever steal from my\npersonal stores again, my hand might\njust slip over your morning pumpkin\njuice.\n\nHARRY\nI haven't stolen anything.\n\nSEVERUS\nDon't lie to me. Gilliweed might be\ninnocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing\nflies? You and your friends are brewing\npolyjuice potion and believe me I'm\ngoing to find out why.\n\nSeverus closes the door in Harry's face.\n\n\nEXT. ARENA\n\nMusic is playing and a large crowd is gathered. The champions\nemerge.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nEarlier today Professor Moody placed\nthe tri-wizards cup deep within the\nmaze. Only he knows its exact position.\nNow as Mr Diggory...\n\nThe crowd cheer on hearing his name.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n(continued) and Mr Potter tied for first\nposition they will be the first to enter\nthe maze. Followed by Mr Krum...\n\nThe bulgarian crowd go nuts.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n(continued) The first person to touch\nthe cup will be the winner. I've instructed\nthe staff to patrol the perimeter, if\nat any point should a contestant wish\nto withdraw from the task he or she\nneed only send up red sparks with their\nwands. Contestants, gather round.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n(To the contestants) In the maze you'll\nfind not dragons or creatures of the\ndeep. Instead you'll face something\nmore challenging. You see, people change\nin the maze. Oh find the cup if you\ncan, but be very weary you could just\nlose yourselves along the way.\n\nMAD-EYE\nChampions! Prepare yourselves.\n\nCedric hugs his father.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nOn the count of three... ONE...\n\nThe cannon goes off. Mr Filch shrugs comically. Dumbledore groans.\nHarry and Cedric enter the maze through different entrances.\nThe entrance closes up behind Harry. Heavy mist sets in, we pan\nout to see the maze is many stories tall. Harry starts traversing\nthe maze, creature noises are all around.\n\nCedric is walking along, the maze walls begin to close in on\nhim. He makes a run for it. Fleur is running around scared, she\nis attacked and knocked down. Viktor comes along and sees she's\nunconscious on the ground, he walks on. Harry sees Fleur being\nswallowed into the undergrowth.\n\nHARRY\nFleur? Fleur!\n\nHe's too late she's disappeared. He sends up a red spark into\nthe air. A heavy wind starts blowing, walls are closing in, Harry\nruns. Harry sees something shining in the distance and he moves\ntowards it Viktor tries to zap him but misses.\n\nCEDRIC\nGet down!\n\nHarry ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up\nand kicks the wand out of Viktor's hand. He points his wand at\nViktor's body as if to finish him off, Harry runs up and intervenes.\n\n\nHARRY\nNo stop! He's bewitched Cedric.\n\nThey struggle.\n\nCEDRIC\nGet off me!\n\nHARRY\nHe's bewitched!\n\nThe two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth\ngrabs Cedric and he falls to the ground. Harry looks back. Cedric\nis pinned down with no means of escape.\n\nCEDRIC\nHarry! Harry!\n\nHarry zaps the plantlife and Cedric wriggles free. Harry helps\nhim up.\n\nCEDRIC\nYou know for a moment there I thought\nyou were gonna let it get me.\n\nHARRY\nFor a moment so did I.\n\nCEDRIC\nSome game huh?\n\nHARRY\nSome game.\n\nThe wind starts blowing again.\n\nCEDRIC\nGo. Take it, you saved me!\n\nHARRY\nTogether, on three. One, two, three!\n\n\n\nEXT. GRAVEYARD\n\nHarry and Cedric have ported to a graveyard.\n\nCEDRIC\nYou ok?\n\nHARRY\nYeah, you?\n\nCEDRIC\nWhere are we?\n\nHARRY\nI've been here before.\n\nCEDRIC\nIt's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey.\n\n\nHARRY\nI've been here before in a dream. Cedric,\nwe have to get back to the cup? Now!\n\n\nCEDRIC\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nHarry lets out a shout and holds his head, he is in pain.\n\nCEDRIC\nWhat is it?\n\nHARRY\nGet back to the cup!\n\nWe see Wormtail and Voldemort nearby.\n\nCEDRIC\nWho are you? What do you want?\n\nVOLDEMORT\nKill the spare.\n\nWormtail casts a spell and kills Cedric.\n\nHARRY\nCedric!\n\nCedric lays dead on the ground.\n\nWormtail pulls Harry closer, a status grabs hold of Harry and\ntraps him.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nDo it, now!\n\nWormtail drops something into a cauldron, Harry watches on.\n\n\nWORMTAIL\nBones of the father, unwillingly given.\n\n\nA bone hovers in the air under Wormtail's control, he drops it\ninto the cauldron.\n\nWORMTAIL\nFlesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.\n\n\nHe takes a knife and slashes his arm over the cauldron.\n\nWORMTAIL\nBlood of the enemy forcibly taken.\n\n\nHe takes the knife to Harry and cuts at his arm. Harry shouts.\nWormtail takes the knife over to the cauldron and lets the drops\nfall into it.\n\nWORMTAIL\nThe dark lord shall rise again.\n\nThe cauldron bursts into flame and a reformed Voldemort emerges.\n\n\nVOLDEMORT\nMy wand Wormtail.\n\nWormtail hands him the wand and bows deeply.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nHold out your arm.\n\nWORMTAIL\nMaster. Thank you master.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nThe other arm Wormtail.\n\nWormtail looks concerned, but does it anyway. Voldemort sticks\nthe wand into Wormtail's arm. The sky changes, others have been\nsummoned.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nWelcome my friends. Thirty years it's\nbeen, and yet you stand before me as\nthough it were only yesterday. I confess\nmyself disappointed, not one of you\ntried to find me.\n\nVoldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nNot even you, Lucius.\n\nLUCIUS\nMy lord. Had I detected any sign or\neven a whisper of your whereabouts.\n\n\nVOLDEMORT\nThere were signs my friend, and more\nthan whispers.\n\nLUCIUS\nI assure you I never renounced the old\nways. The face I have been obliged to\npresent each day since your absence,\nthat was my true mask.\n\nWORMTAIL\nI returned.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nOut of fear, not loyalty. Still you\nhave proved yourself useful these past\nfew months Wormtail.\n\nVoldemort grants Wormtail a new hand.\n\nWORMTAIL\nThank you master, thank you.\n\nVOLDEMORT\n(To Cedric's corpse) Oh, such a handsome\nboy.\n\nHARRY\nDon't touch him.\n\nHarry struggles to get free.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nHarry! I'd almost forgotten you were\nhere. Standing on the bones of my father.\nI'd introduce you but word has it you're\nalmost as famous as me these days. The\nboy who lived. How lies have fed your\nlegend Harry. Shall I reveal what really\nhappened that night thirteen years ago?\nShall I divulge how I truly lost my\npowers? It was love. You see when dear\nsweet Lily Potter gave her life for\nher only son she provided the ultimate\nprotection. I could not touch you. It\nwas old magic, something I should have\nforseen. But no matter, no matter. Things\nhave changed, I can touch you now!\n\n\nVoldemort puts his hand on Harry's head and he screams.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nAstonishing what a few drops of your\nblood will do eh Harry? Pick up your\nwand Potter. I said pick it up, get\nup. Get up! You've been taught how to\nduel I presume yes? First we bow to\neach other. Come on now Harry the niceties\nmust be observed, Dumbledore would not\nwant you to forget your manners now\nwould he? I said bow!\n\nVoldemort forces Harry to bow with magic.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nThat's better. And now...\n\nVoldemort casts at Harry and he wriggles in pain.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nAtta boy Harry, your parents would be\nproud. Especially your filthy mongrel\nmother. I'm going to kill you Harry\nPotter, I'm going to destroy you. After\ntonight no one will ever again question\nmy powers. After tonight if they speak\nof you they'll speak only of how you\nbegged for death, and I being a merciful\nlord obliged. Get up.\n\nVoldemort pulls Harry to his feet, Harry begins to move away.\n\n\nVOLDEMORT\nDon't you turn your back on me Harry\nPotter I want you to look at me when\nI kill you, I want to see the lights\nleave your eyes.\n\nHarry takes steps toward Voldemort.\n\nHARRY\nHave it your way.\n\nThey both cast and their streams of magic meet. They both struggle.\n\n\nVOLDEMORT\nDo nothing. He is mine to finish. He's\nmine!\n\nShapes form in the surrounding magical energy. We hear Dumbledore's\nvoice.\n\nHARRY'S DAD\n(voice) Harry when the connection is\nbroken you must get to the portkey.\nWe can delay it for a moment to give\nyou time but only a moment, do you understand?\n\n\nCEDRIC\n(voice) Harry take my body back will\nyou? Take my body back to my father.\n\n\nHARRY'S MOTHER\n(voice) Let go. Sweetheart you're ready.\nLet go! Let go!\n\nThe connection breaks, Harry runs over to Cedric's body and summons\nthe cup over to them. In an instant the port out. Voldemort looks\nangry.\n\nVOLDEMORT\nNo!\n\n\nEXT. ARENA\n\nBack at the arena Harry appears with Cedric's body. The crowd\ndon't understand what has taken place and they all cheer, triumphant\nmusic starts to play. Harry weeps on Cedric's body.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nHarry! Harry!\n\nDumbledore tries to prize Harry from Cedric's body.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nTell me what happened!\n\nHARRY\nHe's back, he's back! Voldemort's back.\nCedric, he asked me to bring his body\nback. I couldn't leave him, not there.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nIt's alright Harry. It's alright, he's\nhome, you both are.\n\nFUDGE\nKeep everybody in their seats. A boy\nhas just been killed. The body must\nbe moved Dumbledore, there are... too\nmany people.\n\nAMOS\nLet me through! That's my son! My boy!\n\n\nAmos breaks down wailing. The crowd look on distraught.\n\n\nINT. DARKENED ROOM\n\nMad-Eye Moody enters and closes the door behind him. Harry is\nin the room still sobbing. They sit.\n\nMAD-EYE\nAre you alright Potter?\n\nHarry nods.\n\nMAD-EYE\nDoes it hurt?\n\nHARRY\nNot so much now.\n\nMAD-EYE\nI'd better take a look at it.\n\nWe see Harry's arm, it has a skull and snake marking.\n\nHARRY\nThe cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched\nit.\n\nMAD-EYE\nWhat was it like? What was he like?\n\n\nHARRY\nWho?\n\nMAD-EYE\nThe dark lord. What was it like to stand\nin his presence?\n\nHARRY\nI dunno. It was like I'd fallen into\none of my dreams. One of my nightmares.\n\n\nMad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, he reaches for\nhis bottle but it's empty. He rushes to a chest with other bottles\nand struggles to find one.\n\nMAD-EYE\nWere there others? In the graveyard,\nwere there others?\n\nHARRY\nUm. I don't think I said anything about\na graveyard Professor.\n\nMAD-EYE\nMarvellous creatures dragons aren't\nthey? Do you think that miserable oaf\nwould have led you into the woods if\nI hadn't suggested it? Do you think\nCedric Diggory would have told you to\nhold the egg under the water if I hadn't\nhave told him first myself? Do you think\nNeville Longbottom the witless wonder\ncould have provided you with gilliweed\nif I hadn't have given him the book\nthat led you straight to it? Huh??\n\n\nHARRY\nIt was you from the beginning. You put\nmy name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched\nKrum. But...\n\nMad-Eye makes sobbing noises making fun of Harry.\n\nMAD-EYE\nYou won because I made it so Potter.\nYou ended up in that graveyard tonight\nbecause it was meant to be so. And now\nthe deed is done. The blood that runs\nthrough these veins runs within the\ndark lord. Imagine how he will reward\nme when he learns that I have once and\nfor all silenced the great Harry Potter.\n\n\nA flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall.\nDumbledore and Severus come rushing in. Dumbledore takes Mad-Eye\nby the neck...\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nSeverus...\n\nSeverus administers some veritaserum. Mad-Eye wriggles demonically.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nDo you know who I am?\n\nMAD-EYE\nAlbus Dumbledore.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nAre you Alastor Moody? Are ya?\n\nMAD-EYE\nNo.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nIs he in this room? Is he in this room?\n\n\nWe see a nod.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nHarry get away from there!\n\nDumbledore approaches the chest. The chest opens, it contains\na series of smaller chests. When the final chest is open we see\nthat there's a pit within holding a man the real Alastor Moody.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nAre you alright Alastor?\n\nALASTOR\nI'm sorry Albus.\n\nHARRY\nThat's Moody, but then who's...?\n\nDumbledore holds up one of Mad-Eye's Bottles.\n\nSEVERUS\nPolyjuice potion.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nNow we know who's been stealing it from\nyour store Severus.\n\nDumbledore looks into the pit.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nWe'll get you up in a minute.\n\nAlastor Moody groans. The Mad-Eye Moody they have captive in\na chair begins to twitch about restlessly making strange noises.\nHe appears to be transforming. He rips off his fake eyepiece\nwhich falls on the floor, we see that he's transformed into Barty\nCrouch Junior.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nBarty Crouch Junior.\n\nBARTY JR\nI'll show you mine if you show me yours.\n\n\nBarty Jr rolls up his sleeve to reveal a skull and snake marking.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nYour arm Harry.\n\nBARTY JR\nYou know what this means don't you?\nHe's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nSend an owl to Azkaban, think they'll\nfind they're missing a prisoner.\n\n\nBARTY JR\nI'll be welcomed back like a hero.\n\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nPerhaps. Personally I've never had much\ntime for heroes.\n\n\nINT. ASSEMBLY ROOM\n\nDUMBLEDORE\n(Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge\na really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory\nwas as you all know, exceptionally hard\nworking, intricately fair minded. And\nmost importantly a fierce fierce friend.\nI think therefore you have the right\nto know exactly how he died. You see,\nCedric Diggory was murdered by Lord\nVoldemort. The ministry of magic does\nnot wish me to tell you this. But not\nto do so I think would be an insult\nto his memory. Now the pain we all feel\nat this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds\nus that while we may come from different\nplaces and speak in different tongues,\nour hearts beat as one. In light of\nrecent events the bonds of friendship\nwe made this year will be more important\nthan ever. Remember that and Cedric\nDiggory will not have died in vain,\nyou remember that. And we'll celebrate\na boy who was kind and honest and brave\nand true right to the very end.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM\n\nHarry is sitting on a bed, Dumbledore walks in.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nI never liked these curtains. Set them\non fire in my fourth year, by accident\nof course. I put you in terrible danger\nthis year Harry I'm sorry.\n\nHARRY\nProfessor, when I was in the graveyard\nthere was a moment... um... when Voldemort's\nwand and mine sort of connected.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nPriori Incantatem. You saw your parents\nthat night didn't you? They reappeared.\n\n\nHarry nods.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\nNo spell can reawaken the dead Harry\nI trust you know that. Dark and diffiult\ntimes lie ahead. Soon we must all face\nthe choice between what is right what\nis easy. But remember this, you have\nfriends here. You're not alone.\n\n\nEXT. HOGWARTS\n\nThere's a large crowd gathered, the pupils are going home. Viktor\nKrum gives Hermione a kiss and hands her some paper.\n\nVIKTOR\nWrite to me. Promise.\n\nHERMIONE\nBye.\n\nRon is sitting alone. The french sisters approach him, they both\nin turn give him a kiss on the head.\n\nFLEUR\nAu revoir Ron.\n\nThe Beauxbatons girls leave in uniform, the crowd applauds. The\nDurmstrang boys leave too, shaking hands as they go.\n\nRON\nDo you think we'll ever just have a\nquiet year at Hogwarts?\n\nHERMIONE\nNo.\n\nHARRY\nNo I don't think so.\n\nHERMIONE\nEverything's going to change now isn't\nit?\n\nHARRY\nYes.\n\nHERMIONE\nPromise you'll write this summer. Both\nof you.\n\nRON\nWell I won't. You know I won't!\n\nHERMIONE\nHarry will won't you?\n\nHARRY\nYeah. Every week.\n\nThey look over the balcony, the flying horses pulling a carriage\nhead off into the distance. The Bulgarians' ship goes underwater.\n\n\n\nFADE OUT.4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/4314309", "artist_names": "URLtv (Ft.

careful when you get there, we hate to be bereft\nBut we're takin' down the names of everybody turnin' left\n\n[Chorus 1]\nOh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society\nHere to save our country from a communistic plot\nJoin the John Birch Society, help us fill the ranks\nTo get this movement started we need lots of tools and cranks\n[Verse 2]\nNow, there's no one that we're certain the Kremlin doesn't touch\nWe think that Westbrook Pegler doth protest a bit too much\nWe only hail the hero from whom we got our name\nWe're not sure what he did, but he's our hero just the same\n\n[Chorus 2]\nOh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society\nSocialism is the ism dismalest of all\nJoin the John Birch Society, there's so much to do\nHave you heard they're serving vodka at the WCTU?\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, you've heard about the agents that we've already named\nWell MCA has agents that are flauntedly unashamed\nWe're after Rosie Clooney, we've gotten Pinkie Lee\nAnd the day we get Red Skelton won't that be a victory?\n\n[Chorus 3]\nOh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society\nNorman Vincent Peale may think he's kidding us along\nBut the John Birch Society knows he spilled the beans\nHe keeps on preaching brotherhood, but we know what he means\n\n[Verse 4]\nWe'll teach you how to spot 'em in the cities or the sticks\nFor even Jasper Junction is just full of Bolsheviks\nThe CIA's subversive and so's the FCC\nThere's no one left but thee and we, and we're not sure of thee\nYou might also like[Chorus 4]\nOh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society\nHere to save our country from a communistic plot\nJoin the John Birch Society holding off the reds\nWe'll use our hands and hearts and if we must we'll use our heads\n\n[Verse 5]\nDo you want Justice Warren for your Commissar?\nDo you want Mrs. Krushchev in there with the DAR?\nYou cannot trust your neighbor or even next of kin\nIf mommie is a commie then you gotta turn her in\n\n[Chorus 5]\nOh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society\nFighting for the right to fight the right fight for the Right\nJoin the John Birch Society as we're marching on\nAnd we'll all be glad to see you when we're meeting in the John\nIn the John, in the John Birch Society1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1024305",

A sugarsticky girl shovelling scoopfuls of creams for a christian brother. Some school treat. Bad for their tummies. Lozenge and comfit manufacturer to His Majesty the King. God. Save. Our. Sitting on his throne sucking red jujubes white.\n\nA sombre Y.M.C.A. young man, watchful among the warm sweet fumes of Graham Lemon's, placed a throwaway in a hand of Mr Bloom.\n\nHeart to heart talks.\nBloo... Me? No.\nBlood of the Lamb.\n\nHis slow feet walked him riverward, reading. Are you saved? All are washed in the blood of the lamb. God wants blood victim. Birth, hymen, martyr, war, foundation of a building, sacrifice, kidney burntoffering, druids' altars. Elijah is coming. Dr John Alexander Dowie restorer of the church in Zion is coming.\nIs coming! Is coming!! Is coming!!! All heartily welcome. Paying game. Torry and Alexander last year. Polygamy. His wife will put the stopper on that. Where was that ad some Birmingham firm the luminous crucifix. Our Saviour. Wake up in the dead of night and see him on the wall, hanging. Pepper's ghost idea. Iron nails ran in.\n\nPhosphorus it must be done with. If you leave a bit of codfish for instance. I could see the bluey silver over it. Night I went down to the pantry in the kitchen. Don't like all the smells in it waiting to rush out. What was it she wanted? The Malaga raisins. Thinking of Spain. Before Rudy was born. The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny. Very good for the brain.\n\nFrom Butler's monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor's walk. Dedalus' daughter there still outside Dillon's auctionrooms. Must be selling off some old furniture. Knew her eyes at once from the father. Lobbing about waiting for him. Home always breaks up when the mother goes. Fifteen children he had. Birth every year almost. That's in their theology or the priest won't give the poor woman the confession, the absolution. Increase and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? Eat you out of house and home. No families themselves to feed. Living on the fat of the land. Their butteries and larders. I'd like to see them do the black fast Yom Kippur. Crossbuns. One meal and a collation for fear he'd collapse on the altar. A housekeeper of one of those fellows if you could pick it out of her. Never pick it out of her. Like getting l.s.d. out of him. Does himself well. No guests. All for number one. Watching his water. Bring your own bread and butter. His reverence: mum's the word.\n\nGood Lord, that poor child's dress is in flitters. Underfed she looks too. Potatoes and marge, marge and potatoes. It's after they feel it. Proof of the pudding. Undermines the constitution.\n\nAs he set foot on O'Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from the parapet. Brewery barge with export stout. England. Sea air sours it, I heard. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see the brewery. Regular world in itself. Vats of porter wonderful. Rats get in too. Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Dead drunk on the porter. Drink till they puke again like christians. Imagine drinking that! Rats: vats. Well, of course, if we knew all the things.\n\nLooking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls, gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben J's son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and eightpence too much. Hhhhm. It's the droll way he comes out with the things. Knows how to tell a story too.\n\nThey wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.\n\nHe threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet per sec is com. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells, floated under by the bridgepiers. Not such damn fools. Also the day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin's King picked it up in the wake fifty yards astern. Live by their wits. They wheeled, flapping.\n\nThe hungry famished gull\nFlaps o'er the waters dull.\n\nThat is how poets write, the similar sounds. But then Shakespeare has no rhymes: blank verse. The flow of the language it is. The thoughts. Solemn.\n\nHamlet, I am thy father's spirit\nDoomed for a certain time to walk the earth.\n\u2014Two apples a penny! Two for a penny!\n\nHis gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand. Australians they must be this time of year. Shiny peels: polishes them up with a rag or a handkerchief.\nWait. Those poor birds.\n\nHe halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey. See that? The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from their heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel.\n\nAware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his hands. They never expected that. Manna. Live on fish, fishy flesh they have, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swim down here sometimes to preen themselves. No accounting for tastes. Wonder what kind is swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.\n\nThey wheeled flapping weakly. I'm not going to throw any more. Penny quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread foot and mouth disease too. If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes like that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty? How is that?\n\nHis eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.\n\nKino's 11/- Trousers\n\nGood idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you own water really? It's always flowing in a stream, never the same, which in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All kinds of places are good for ads. That quack doctor for the clap used to be stuck up in all the greenhouses. Never see it now. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks. Didn't cost him a red like Maginni the dancing master self advertisement. Got fellows to stick them up or stick them up himself for that matter on the q. t. running in to loosen a button. Flybynight. Just the place too. POST NO BILLS. POST 110 PILLS. Some chap with a dose burning him.\n\nIf he...?\nO!\n\nEh?\n\nNo... No.\n\nNo, no. I don't believe it. He wouldn't surely?\n\nNo, no.\n\nMr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about that. After one. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Dunsink time. Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball's. Parallax. I never exactly understood. There's a priest. Could ask him. Par it's Greek: parallel, parallax. Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her about the transmigration. O rocks!\nMr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice. She's right after all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound. She's not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was thinking. Still, I don't know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice. He has legs like barrels and you'd think he was singing into a barrel. Now, isn't that wit. They used to call him big Ben. Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an albatross. Get outside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at stowing away number one Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.\n\nA procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S. Wisdom Hely's. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Our staple food. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street. Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are not Boyl: no, M Glade's men. Doesn't bring in any business either. I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I bet that would have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once. Everyone dying to know what she's writing. Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women too. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn't have it of course because he didn't think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree's potted under the obituaries, cold meat department. You can't lick 'em. What? Our envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you going? Can't stop, Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser Kansell, sold by Hely's Ltd, 85 Dame street. Well out of that ruck I am. Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents. Tranquilla convent. That was a nice nun there, really sweet face. Wimple suited her small head. Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes. Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman. I disturbed her at her devotions that morning. But glad to communicate with the outside world. Our great day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name too: caramel. She knew I, I think she knew by the way she. If she had married she would have changed. I suppose they really were short of money. Fried everything in the best butter all the same. No lard for them. My heart's broke eating dripping. They like buttering themselves in and out. Molly tasting it, her veil up. Sister? Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker's daughter. It was a nun they say invented barbed wire.\n\nHe crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. Rover cycleshop. Those races are on today. How long ago is that? Year Phil Gilligan died. We were in Lombard street west. Wait: was in Thom's. Got the job in Wisdom Hely's year we married. Six years. Ten years ago: ninetyfour he died yes that's right the big fire at Arnott's. Val Dillon was lord mayor. The Glencree dinner. Alderman Robert O'Reilly emptying the port into his soup before the flag fell. Bobbob lapping it for the inner alderman. Couldn't hear what the band played. For what we have already received may the Lord make us. Milly was a kiddy then. Molly had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs. Mantailored with selfcovered buttons. She didn't like it because I sprained my ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf. As if that. Old Goodwin's tall hat done up with some sticky stuff. Flies' picnic too. Never put a dress on her back like it. Fitted her like a glove, shoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out well. Rabbitpie we had that day. People looking after her.\n\nHappy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper. Dockrell's, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly's tubbing night. American soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she looked soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa's daguerreotype atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.\n\nHe walked along the curbstone.\n\nStream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always squinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in Citron's saint Kevin's parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is getting. Pen ...? Of course it's years ago. Noise of the trams probably. Well, if he couldn't remember the dayfather's name that he sees every day.\n\nBartell d'Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home after practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her that song Winds that blow from the south.\n\nWindy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin's concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings. Lucky it didn't. Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin linking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell concerts. Positively last appearance on any stage. May be for months and may be for never. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up. Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin. She did get flushed in the wind. Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked. And the mulled rum. Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.\n\nSwish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her. Always liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near two taking out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy. That was the night...\n\n\u2014O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?\n\n\u2014O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?\n\n\u2014No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven't seen her for ages.\n\n\u2014In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.\n\n\u2014Go away! Isn't that grand for her?\n\n\u2014Yes. In a photographer's there. Getting on like a house on fire. How are all your charges?\n\n\u2014All on the baker's list, Mrs Breen said.\n\nHow many has she? No other in sight.\n\n\u2014You're in black, I see. You have no...\n\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.\n\nGoing to crop up all day, I foresee. Who's dead, when and what did he die of? Turn up like a bad penny.\n\n\u2014O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn't any near relation.\n\nMay as well get her sympathy.\n\n\u2014Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly, poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.\n\nYour funeral's tomorrow While you're coming through the rye. Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle...\n\n\u2014Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen's womaneyes said melancholily.\n\nNow that's quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.\n\n\u2014And your lord and master?\n\nMrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn't lost them anyhow.\n\n\u2014O, don't be talking! she said. He's a caution to rattlesnakes. He's in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me heartscalded. Wait till I show you.\n\nHot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison's. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom's gullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they'd taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork chained to the table.\n\nOpening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on those things. Stick it in a chap's eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open. Money. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain. Husband barging. Where's the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are you feeding your little brother's family? Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she?...\n\n\u2014There must be a new moon out, she said. He's always bad then. Do you know what he did last night?\n\nHer hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.\n\n\u2014What? Mr Bloom asked.\n\nLet her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.\n\n\u2014Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.\n\nIndiges.\n\n\u2014Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.\n\n\u2014The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.\n\nShe took a folded postcard from her handbag.\n\n\u2014Read that, she said. He got it this morning.\n\n\u2014What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.P.?\n\n\u2014U.P.: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It's a great shame for them whoever he is.\n\n\u2014Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.\n\nShe took back the card, sighing.\n\n\u2014And now he's going round to Mr Menton's office. He's going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.\n\nShe folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.\n\nSame blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a tasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than Molly.\n\nSee the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.\n\nHe looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent. Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I'm hungry too. Flakes of pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek. Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie Powell that was. In Luke Doyle's long ago. Dolphin's Barn, the charades. U.P.: up.\n\nChange the subject.\n\n\u2014Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.\n\n\u2014Mina Purefoy? she said.\n\nPhilip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers' Club. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.\n\n\u2014Yes.\n\n\u2014I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She's in the lying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She's three days bad now.\n\n\u2014O, Mr Bloom said. I'm sorry to hear that.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It's a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.\n\n\u2014-O, Mr Bloom said.\n\nHis heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in compassion. Dth! Dth!\n\n\u2014I'm sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That's terrible for her.\n\nMrs Breen nodded.\n\n\u2014She was taken bad on the Tuesday...\n\nMr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:\n\n\u2014Mind! Let this man pass.\n\nA bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat, a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.\n\n\u2014Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch!\n\n\u2014Who is he if it's a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?\n\n\u2014His name is Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom said smiling. Watch!\n\n\u2014He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these days.\n\nShe broke off suddenly.\n\n\u2014There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to Molly, won't you?\n\n\u2014I will, Mr Bloom said.\n\nHe watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison's hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay. Like old times. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.\n\nMeshuggah. Off his chump.\n\nMr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two days. Watch him! Out he goes again. One way of getting on in the world. And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds. Hard time she must have with him.\n\nU.P.: up. I'll take my oath that's Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. Wrote it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything. Round to Menton's office. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a feast for the gods.\n\nHe passed the Irish Times. There might be other answers Iying there. Like to answer them all. Good system for criminals. Code. At their lunch now. Clerk with the glasses there doesn't know me. O, leave them there to simmer. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them. Wanted, smart lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work. I called you naughty darling because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the meaning. Please tell me what perfume does your wife. Tell me who made the world. The way they spring those questions on you. And the other one Lizzie Twigg. My literary efforts have had the good fortune to meet with the approval of the eminent poet A. E. (Mr Geo. Russell). No time to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of poetry.\n\nBest paper by long chalks for a small ad. Got the provinces now. Cook and general, exc. cuisine, housemaid kept. Wanted live man for spirit counter. Resp. girl (R.C.) wishes to hear of post in fruit or pork shop. James Carlisle made that. Six and a half per cent dividend. Made a big deal on Coates's shares. Ca' canny. Cunning old Scotch hunks. All the toady news. Our gracious and popular vicereine. Bought the Irish Field now. Lady Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement and rode out with the Ward Union staghounds at the enlargement yesterday at Rathoath. Uneatable fox. Pothunters too. Fear injects juices make it tender enough for them. Riding astride. Sit her horse like a man. Weightcarrying huntress. No sidesaddle or pillion for her, not for Joe. First to the meet and in at the death. Strong as a brood mare some of those horsey women. Swagger around livery stables. Toss off a glass of brandy neat while you'd say knife. That one at the Grosvenor this morning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Stonewall or fivebarred gate put her mount to it. Think that pugnosed driver did it out of spite. Who is this she was like? O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that sold me her old wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel. Divorced Spanish American. Didn't take a feather out of her my handling them. As if I was her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the Express. Scavenging what the quality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the plums thinking it was custard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few weeks after. Want to be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work for her, thanks.\n\nPoor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband. Method in his madness. Saffron bun and milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy. Y. M. C. A. Eating with a stopwatch, thirtytwo chews to the minute. And still his muttonchop whiskers grew. Supposed to be well connected. Theodore's cousin in Dublin Castle. One tony relative in every family. Hardy annuals he presents her with. Saw him out at the Three Jolly Topers marching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a marketnet. The squallers. Poor thing! Then having to give the breast year after year all hours of the night. Selfish those t.t's are. Dog in the manger. Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.\n\nHe stood at Fleet street crossing. Luncheon interval. A sixpenny at Rowe's? Must look up that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in the Burton. Better. On my way.\n\nHe walked on past Bolton's Westmoreland house. Tea. Tea. Tea. I forgot to tap Tom Kernan.\n\nSss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a vinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Phew! Dreadful simply! Child's head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out. Kill me that would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent something to stop that. Life with hard labour. Twilight sleep idea: queen Victoria was given that. Nine she had. A good layer. Old woman that lived in a shoe she had so many children. Suppose he was consumptive. Time someone thought about it instead of gassing about the what was it the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence. Flapdoodle to feed fools on. They could easily have big establishments whole thing quite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings and five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years want to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.\n\nNot stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for nothing.\n\nFunny sight two of them together, their bellies out. Molly and Mrs Moisel. Mothers' meeting. Phthisis retires for the time being, then returns. How flat they look all of a sudden after. Peaceful eyes. Weight off their mind. Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. All my babies, she said. The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them. O, that's nyumnyum. Got her hand crushed by old Tom Wall's son. His first bow to the public. Head like a prize pumpkin. Snuffy Dr Murren. People knocking them up at all hours. For God' sake, doctor. Wife in her throes. Then keep them waiting months for their fee. To attendance on your wife. No gratitude in people. Humane doctors, most of them.\n\nBefore the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of pigeons flew. Their little frolic after meals. Who will we do it on? I pick the fellow in black. Here goes. Here's good luck. Must be thrilling from the air. Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the trees near Goose green playing the monkeys. Mackerel they called me.\n\nA squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian file. Goosestep. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their truncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their belts. Policeman's lot is oft a happy one. They split up in groups and scattered, saluting, towards their beats. Let out to graze. Best moment to attack one in pudding time. A punch in his dinner. A squad of others, marching irregularly, rounded Trinity railings making for the station. Bound for their troughs. Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare to receive soup.\n\nHe crossed under Tommy Moore's roguish finger. They did right to put him up over a urinal: meeting of the waters. Ought to be places for women. Running into cakeshops. Settle my hat straight. There is not in this wide world a vallee. Great song of Julia Morkan's. Kept her voice up to the very last. Pupil of Michael Balfe's, wasn't she?\n\nHe gazed after the last broad tunic. Nasty customers to tackle. Jack Power could a tale unfold: father a G man. If a fellow gave them trouble being lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the bridewell. Can't blame them after all with the job they have especially the young hornies. That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money. My word he did! His horse's hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. Lucky I had the presence of mind to dive into Manning's or I was souped. He did come a wallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on the cobblestones. I oughtn't to have got myself swept along with those medicals. And the Trinity jibs in their mortarboards. Looking for trouble. Still I got to know that young Dixon who dressed that sting for me in the Mater and now he's in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy. Wheels within wheels. Police whistle in my ears still. All skedaddled. Why he fixed on me. Give me in charge. Right here it began.\n\n\u2014Up the Boers!\n\n\u2014Three cheers for De Wet!\n\n\u2014We'll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.\n\nSilly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill. The Butter exchange band. Few years' time half of them magistrates and civil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows used to. Whether on the scaffold high.\n\nNever know who you're talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in his eye. Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff on the invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to get in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the castle. Drop him like a hot potato. Why those plainclothes men are always courting slaveys. Easily twig a man used to uniform. Squarepushing up against a backdoor. Maul her a bit. Then the next thing on the menu. And who is the gentleman does be visiting there? Was the young master saying anything? Peeping Tom through the keyhole. Decoy duck. Hotblooded young student fooling round her fat arms ironing.\n\n\u2014Are those yours, Mary?\n\n\u2014I don't wear such things... Stop or I'll tell the missus on you. Out half the night.\n\n\u2014There are great times coming, Mary. Wait till you see.\n\n\u2014Ah, gelong with your great times coming.\n\nBarmaids too. Tobaccoshopgirls.\n\nJames Stephens' idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that a fellow couldn't round on more than his own ring. Sinn Fein. Back out you get the knife. Hidden hand. Stay in. The firing squad. Turnkey's daughter got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk. Putting up in the Buckingham Palace hotel under their very noses. Garibaldi.\n\nYou must have a certain fascination: Parnell. Arthur Griffith is a squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. Or gas about our lovely land. Gammon and spinach. Dublin Bakery Company's tearoom. Debating societies. That republicanism is the best form of government. That the language question should take precedence of the economic question. Have your daughters inveigling them to your house. Stuff them up with meat and drink. Michaelmas goose. Here's a good lump of thyme seasoning under the apron for you. Have another quart of goosegrease before it gets too cold. Halffed enthusiasts. Penny roll and a walk with the band. No grace for the carver. The thought that the other chap pays best sauce in the world. Make themselves thoroughly at home. Show us over those apricots, meaning peaches. The not far distant day. Homerule sun rising up in the northwest.\n\nHis smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly, shadowing Trinity's surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing, outgoing, clanging. Useless words. Things go on same, day after day: squads of police marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies mooching about. Dignam carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed groaning to have a child tugged out of her. One born every second somewhere. Other dying every second. Since I fed the birds five minutes. Three hundred kicked the bucket. Other three hundred born, washing the blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling maaaaaa.\n\nCityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other coming on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of pavements, piledup bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that. Landlord never dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets his notice to quit. They buy the place up with gold and still they have all the gold. Swindle in it somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away age after age. Pyramids in sand. Built on bread and onions. Slaves Chinese wall. Babylon. Big stones left. Round towers. Rest rubble, sprawling suburbs, jerrybuilt. Kerwan's mushroom houses built of breeze. Shelter, for the night.\n\nNo-one is anything.\n\nThis is the very worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate this hour. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.\n\nProvost's house. The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon. Well tinned in there. Like a mortuary chapel. Wouldn't live in it if they paid me. Hope they have liver and bacon today. Nature abhors a vacuum.\n\nThe sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the silverware opposite in Walter Sexton's window by which John Howard Parnell passed, unseeing.\n\nThere he is: the brother. Image of him. Haunting face. Now that's a coincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don't meet him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be a corporation meeting today. They say he never put on the city marshal's uniform since he got the job. Charley Kavanagh used to come out on his high horse, cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved. Look at the woebegone walk of him. Eaten a bad egg. Poached eyes on ghost. I have a pain. Great man's brother: his brother's brother. He'd look nice on the city charger. Drop into the D.B.C. probably for his coffee, play chess there. His brother used men as pawns. Let them all go to pot. Afraid to pass a remark on him. Freeze them up with that eye of his. That's the fascination: the name. All a bit touched. Mad Fanny and his other sister Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness. Bolt upright lik surgeon M'Ardle. Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath. Apply for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life. The patriot's banquet. Eating orangepeels in the park. Simon Dedalus said when they put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the grave and lead him out of the house of commons by the arm.\n\n\u2014Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks with a Scotch accent. The tentacles...\n\nThey passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. Beard and bicycle. Young woman.\n\nAnd there he is too. Now that's really a coincidence: second time. Coming events cast their shadows before. With the approval of the eminent poet, Mr Geo. Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. A. E.: what does that mean? Initials perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire. What was he saying? The ends of the world with a Scotch accent. Tentacles: octopus. Something occult: symbolism. Holding forth. She's taking it all in. Not saying a word. To aid gentleman in literary work.\n\nHis eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle, a listening woman at his side. Coming from the vegetarian. Only weggebobbles and fruit. Don't eat a beefsteak. If you do the eyes of that cow will pursue you through all eternity. They say it's healthier. Windandwatery though. Tried it. Keep you on the run all day. Bad as a bloater. Dreams all night. Why do they call that thing they gave me nutsteak? Nutarians. Fruitarians. To give you the idea you are eating rumpsteak. Absurd. Salty too. They cook in soda. Keep you sitting by the tap all night.\n\nHer stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless. Those literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic. Esthetes they are. I wouldn't be surprised if it was that kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical. For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts you couldn't squeeze a line of poetry out of him. Don't know what poetry is even. Must be in a certain mood.\n\nThe dreamy cloudy gull\nWaves o'er the waters dull.\n\nHe crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates and Son, pricing the fieldglasses. Or will I drop into old Harris's and have a chat with young Sinclair? Wellmannered fellow. Probably at his lunch. Must get those old glasses of mine set right. Goerz lenses six guineas. Germans making their way everywhere. Sell on easy terms to capture trade. Undercutting. Might chance on a pair in the railway lost property office. Astonishing the things people leave behind them in trains and cloakrooms. What do they be thinking about? Women too. Incredible. Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up that farmer's daughter's ba and hand it to her at Limerick junction. Unclaimed money too. There's a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test those glasses by.\n\nHis lids came down on the lower rims of his irides. Can't see it. If you imagine it's there you can almost see it. Can't see it.\n\nHe faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right hand at arm's length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes: completely. The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun's disk. Must be the focus where the rays cross. If I had black glasses. Interesting. There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were in Lombard street west. Looking up from the back garden. Terrific explosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn some time.\n\nNow that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time. It's the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there some first Saturday of the month. If I could get an introduction to professor Joly or learn up something about his family. That would do to: man always feels complimented. Flattery where least expected. Nobleman proud to be descended from some king's mistress. His foremother. Lay it on with a trowel. Cap in hand goes through the land. Not go in and blurt out what you know you're not to: what's parallax? Show this gentleman the door.\n\nAh.\n\nHis hand fell to his side again.\n\nNever know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about, crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then solid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock, like that pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon out, she said. I believe there is.\n\nHe went on by la maison Claire.\n\nWait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there is a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. Not bad for a Fairview moon. She was humming. The young May moon she's beaming, love. He other side of her. Elbow, arm. He. Glowworm's la-amp is gleaming, love. Touch. Fingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.\n\nStop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.\n\nMr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking passed Adam court.\n\nWith a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here middle of the day of Bob Doran's bottle shoulders. On his annual bend, M Coy said. They drink in order to say or do something or cherchez la femme. Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the rest of the year sober as a judge.\n\nYes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do him good. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the Queen's. Broth of a boy. Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon face in a poky bonnet. Three Purty Maids from School. How time flies, eh? Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts. Drinkers, drinking, laughed spluttering, their drink against their breath. More power, Pat. Coarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke. Take off that white hat. His parboiled eyes. Where is he now? Beggar somewhere. The harp that once did starve us all.\n\nI was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was. She twentythree. When we left Lombard street west something changed. Could never like it again after Rudy. Can't bring back time. Like holding water in your hand. Would you go back to then? Just beginning then. Would you? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? Wants to sew on buttons for me. I must answer. Write it in the library.\n\nGrafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints, silkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in the baking causeway. Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings. Hope the rain mucks them up on her. Countrybred chawbacon. All the beef to the heels were in. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out of plumb.\n\nHe passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers. Cascades of ribbons. Flimsy China silks. A tilted urn poured from its mouth a flood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. The huguenots brought that here. La causa \u00e8 santa! Tara tara. Great chorus that. Taree tara. Must be washed in rainwater. Meyerbeer. Tara: bom bom bom.\n\nPincushions. I'm a long time threatening to buy one. Sticking them all over the place. Needles in window curtains.\n\nHe bared slightly his left forearm. Scrape: nearly gone. Not today anyhow. Must go back for that lotion. For her birthday perhaps. Junejulyaugseptember eighth. Nearly three months off. Then she mightn't like it. Women won't pick up pins. Say it cuts lo.\n\nGleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk stockings.\n\nUseless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.\n\nHigh voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home and houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. Agendath Netaim. Wealth of the world.\n\nA warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded. Perfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he mutely craved to adore.\n\nDuke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.\n\nHe turned Combridge's corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds. Perfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas, creaking beds.\n\n\u2014Jack, love!\n\n\u2014Darling!\n\n\u2014Kiss me, Reggy!\n\n\u2014My boy!\n\n\u2014Love!\n\nHis heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens. See the animals feed.\n\nMen, men, men.\n\nPerched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A pallid suetfaced young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin. New set of microbes. A man with an infant's saucestained napkin tucked round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet. A man spitting back on his plate: halfmasticated gristle: gums: no teeth to chewchewchew it. Chump chop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad booser's eyes. Bitten off more than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves as others see us. Hungry man is an angry man. Working tooth and jaw. Don't! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what he was eating. Something galoptious. Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity. Couldn't swallow it all however.\n\n\u2014Roast beef and cabbage.\n\n\u2014One stew.\n\nSmells of men. His gorge rose. Spaton sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarette smoke, reek of plug, spilt beer, men's beery piss, the stale of ferment.\n\nCouldn't eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all before him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing the cud. Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then on that. Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it off the plate, man! Get out of this.\n\nHe gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of his nose.\n\n\u2014Two stouts here.\n\n\u2014One corned and cabbage.\n\nThat fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended on it. Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat from his three hands. Tear it limb from limb. Second nature to him. Born with a silver knife in his mouth. That's witty, I think. Or no. Silver means born rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.\n\nAn illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the head bailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard. Well up: it splashed yellow near his boot. A diner, knife and fork upright, elbows on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the foodlift across his stained square of newspaper. Other chap telling him something with his mouth full. Sympathetic listener. Table talk. I munched hum un thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday. Ha? Did you, faith?\n\nMr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said:\n\n\u2014Not here. Don't see him.\n\nOut. I hate dirty eaters.\n\nHe backed towards the door. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne's. Stopgap. Keep me going. Had a good breakfast.\n\n\u2014Roast and mashed here.\n\n\u2014Pint of stout.\n\nEvery fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.\n\nHe came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street. Eat or be eaten. Kill! Kill!\n\nSuppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down with porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the street. John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every mother's son don't talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity women and children cabmen priests parsons fieldmarshals archbishops. From Ailesbury road, Clyde road, artisans' dwellings, north Dublin union, lord mayor in his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. My plate's empty. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. Like sir Philip Crampton's fountain. Rub off the microbes with your handkerchief. Next chap rubs on a new batch with his. Father O'Flynn would make hares of them all. Have rows all the same. All for number one. Children fighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a souppot as big as the Phoenix park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of it. Hate people all round you. City Arms hotel table d'h\u00f4te she called it. Soup, joint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you're chewing. Then who'd wash up all the plates and forks? Might be all feeding on tabloids that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.\n\nAfter all there's a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from the earth garlic of course it stinks after Italian organgrinders crisp of onions mushrooms truffles. Pain to the animal too. Pluck and draw fowl. Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe to split their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering bob. Bubble and squeak. Butchers' buckets wobbly lights. Give us that brisket off the hook. Plup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed sheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling nosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers going out. Don't maul them pieces, young one.\n\nHot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed. Insidious. Lick it up smokinghot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.\n\nAh, I'm hungry.\n\nHe entered Davy Byrne's. Moral pub. He doesn't chat. Stands a drink now and then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.\n\nWhat will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?\n\n\u2014Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.\n\n\u2014Hello, Flynn.\n\n\u2014How's things?\n\n\u2014Tiptop... Let me see. I'll take a glass of burgundy and... let me see.\n\nSardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham and his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is home without Plumtree's potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam's potted meat. Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like pickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of honour. Ought to be tough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch the effect. There was a right royal old nigger. Who ate or something the somethings of the reverend Mr MacTrigger. With it an abode of bliss. Lord knows what concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked and minced up. Puzzle find the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together. Hygiene that was what they call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside. Peace and war depend on some fellow's digestion. Religions. Christmas turkeys and geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be merry. Then casual wards full after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all but itself. Mity cheese.\n\n\u2014Have you a cheese sandwich?\n\n\u2014Yes, sir.\n\nLike a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of burgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber, Tom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served me that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God made food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.\n\n\u2014Wife well?\n\n\u2014Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?\n\n\u2014Yes, sir.\n\nNosey Flynn sipped his grog.\n\n\u2014Doing any singing those times?\n\nLook at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match. Music. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him. Does no harm. Free ad.\n\n\u2014She's engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard perhaps.\n\n\u2014No. O, that's the style. Who's getting it up?\n\nThe curate served.\n\n\u2014How much is that?\n\n\u2014Seven d., sir... Thank you, sir.\n\nMr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. Mr MacTrigger. Easier than the dreamy creamy stuff. His five hundred wives. Had the time of their lives.\n\n\u2014Mustard, sir?\n\n\u2014Thank you.\n\nHe studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. Their lives. I have it. It grew bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\n\u2014Getting it up? he said. Well, it's like a company idea, you see. Part shares and part profits.\n\n\u2014Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket to scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn't Blazes Boylan mixed up in it?\n\nA warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom's heart. He raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock five minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.\n\nHis midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly, longingly.\n\nWine.\n\nHe smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.\n\n\u2014Yes, he said. He's the organiser in point of fact.\n\nNo fear: no brains.\n\nNosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.\n\n\u2014He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello barracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he was telling me...\n\nHope that dewdrop doesn't come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.\n\n\u2014For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God till further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is a hairy chap.\n\nDavy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves, cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring's blush. Whose smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat on the parsnips.\n\n\u2014And here's himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give us a good one for the Gold cup?\n\n\u2014I'm off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a horse.\n\n\u2014You're right there, Nosey Flynn said.\n\nMr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his wine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather with the chill off.\n\nNice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like the way it curves there.\n\n\u2014I wouldn't do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined many a man, the same horses.\n\nVintners' sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.\n\n\u2014True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you're in the know. There's no straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He's giving Sceptre today. Zinfandel's the favourite, lord Howard de Walden's, won at Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one against Saint Amant a fortnight before.\n\n\u2014That so? Davy Byrne said...\n\nHe went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned its pages.\n\n\u2014I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of horseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm, Rothschild's filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow cap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O'Gaunt. He put me off it. Ay.\n\nHe drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.\n\n\u2014Ay, he said, sighing.\n\nMr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull. Will I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him forget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down again. Cold nose he'd have kissing a woman. Still they might like. Prickly beards they like. Dogs' cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling stomach's Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling him in her lap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!\n\nWine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish cheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I'm not thirsty. Bath of course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o'clock I can. Six. Six. Time will be gone then. She...\n\nMild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy lobsters' claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing in a thousand years. If you didn't know risky putting anything into your mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you think good. Gaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so on. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting fruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need artificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters. Unsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too. Who found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank oysters. Effect on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this morning. Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed no June has no ar no oysters. But there are people like things high. Tainted game. Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs fifty years old, blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each dish harmless might mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That archduke Leopold was it no yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs? Or who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch in town. Of course aristocrats, then the others copy to be in the fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour. Raw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price. Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the grand. Hock in green glasses. Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom pearls. The \u00e9lite. Cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. They want special dishes to pretend they're. Hermit with a platter of pulse keep down the stings of the flesh. Know me come eat with me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff, Coffey, the butcher, right to venisons of the forest from his ex. Send him back the half of a cow. Spread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls' kitchen area. Whitehatted chef like a rabbi. Combustible duck. Curly cabbage \u00e0 la duchesse de Parme. Just as well to write it on the bill of fare so you can know what you've eaten. Too many drugs spoil the broth. I know it myself. Dosing it with Edwards' desiccated soup. Geese stuffed silly for them. Lobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan. Wouldn't mind being a waiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress, halfnaked ladies. May I tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do bedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect that. A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney, I remember. Du, de la French. Still it's the same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out of making money hand over fist finger in fishes' gills can't write his name on a cheque think he was painting the landscape with his mouth twisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of brogues, worth fifty thousand pounds.\n\nStuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.\n\nGlowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the winepress grapes of Burgundy. Sun's heat it is. Seems to a secret touch telling me memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under wild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky. The bay purple by the Lion's head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards Sutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities. Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you'll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle. Joy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft warm sticky gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants. Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman's breasts full in her blouse of nun's veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.\n\nMe. And me now.\n\nStuck, the flies buzzed.\n\nHis downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab. Beauty: it curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the round hall, naked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don't care what man looks. All to see. Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like Flynn. Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first? Mortal! Put you in your proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes, all ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it drinking electricity: gods' food. Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine. They have no. Never looked. I'll look today. Keeper won't see. Bend down let something drop see if she.\n\nDribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.\n\nWhen the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:\n\n\u2014What is this he is? Isn't he in the insurance line?\n\n\u2014He's out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for the Freeman.\n\n\u2014I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?\n\n\u2014Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?\n\n\u2014I noticed he was in mourning.\n\n\u2014Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at home. You're right, by God. So he was.\n\n\u2014I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.\n\n\u2014It's not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan's wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half. She's well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.\n\n\u2014And is he doing for the Freeman? Davy Byrne said.\n\nNosey Flynn pursed his lips.\n\n\u2014-He doesn't buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of that.\n\n\u2014How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.\n\nNosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He winked.\n\n\u2014He's in the craft, he said.\n\n\u2014-Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.\n\n\u2014Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He's an excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg up. I was told that by a\u2014well, I won't say who.\n\n\u2014Is that a fact?\n\n\u2014O, it's a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you're down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they're as close as damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.\n\nDavy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:\n\n\u2014Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!\n\n\u2014There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.\n\nDavy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:\n\n\u2014And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here and I never once saw him\u2014you know, over the line.\n\n\u2014God Almighty couldn't make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips off when the fun gets too hot. Didn't you see him look at his watch? Ah, you weren't there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he does.\n\n\u2014There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He's a safe man, I'd say.\n\n\u2014He's not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He's been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O, Bloom has his good points. But there's one thing he'll never do.\n\nHis hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.\n\n\u2014I know, Davy Byrne said.\n\n\u2014Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.\n\nPaddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.\n\n\u2014Day, Mr Byrne.\n\n\u2014Day, gentlemen.\n\nThey paused at the counter.\n\n\u2014Who's standing? Paddy Leonard asked.\n\n\u2014I'm sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.\n\n\u2014Well, what'll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.\n\n\u2014I'll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.\n\n\u2014How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God' sake? What's yours, Tom?\n\n\u2014How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.\n\nFor answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.\n\n\u2014Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.\n\n\u2014Certainly, sir.\n\nPaddy Leonard eyed his alemates.\n\n\u2014Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I'm standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg. He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.\n\n\u2014Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.\n\nTom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.\n\n\u2014That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.\n\n\u2014Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.\n\nTom Rochford nodded and drank.\n\n\u2014Is it Zinfandel?\n\n\u2014Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I'm going to plunge five bob on my own.\n\n\u2014Tell us if you're worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said. Who gave it to you?\n\nMr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.\n\n\u2014So long! Nosey Flynn said.\n\nThe others turned.\n\n\u2014That's the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.\n\n\u2014Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we'll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...\n\n\u2014Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.\n\n\u2014Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.\n\nMr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with those Rontgen rays searchlight you could.\n\nAt Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom coasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they move. Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his? Wasting time explaining it to Flynn's mouth. Lean people long mouths. Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free. Course then you'd have all the cranks pestering.\n\nHe hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:\n\nDon Giovanni, a cenar teco M'invitasti.\n\nFeel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap in the blues. Dutch courage. That Kilkenny People in the national library now I must.\n\nBare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show. Science.\n\n\u2014A cenar teco.\n\nWhat does that teco mean? Tonight perhaps.\n\nDon Giovanni, thou hast me invited\nTo come to supper tonight,\nThe rum the rumdum.\n\nDoesn't go properly.\n\nKeyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That'll be two pounds ten about two pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott's dyeworks van over there. If I get Billy Prescott's ad: two fifteen. Five guineas about. On the pig's back.\n\nCould buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.\n\nToday. Today. Not think.\n\nTour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton, Margate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely seaside girls. Against John Long's a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages. Will eat anything.\n\nMr Bloom turned at Gray's confectioner's window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan's bookstore. Why I left the church of Rome? Birds' Nest. Women run him. They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight. Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews. Same bait. Why we left the church of Rome.\n\nA blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No tram in sight. Wants to cross.\n\n\u2014Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.\n\nThe blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He moved his head uncertainly.\n\n\u2014You're in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite. Do you want to cross? There's nothing in the way.\n\nThe cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom's eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks' van drawn up before Drago's. Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in John Long's. Slaking his drouth.\n\n\u2014There's a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it's not moving. I'll see you across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?\n\n\u2014Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.\n\n\u2014Come, Mr Bloom said.\n\nHe touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.\n\nSay something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust what you tell them. Pass a common remark.\n\n\u2014The rain kept off.\n\nNo answer.\n\nStains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different for him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child's hand, his hand. Like Milly's was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder if he has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse's legs: tired drudge get his doze. That's right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a horse.\n\n\u2014Thanks, sir.\n\nKnows I'm a man. Voice.\n\n\u2014Right now? First turn to the left.\n\nThe blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.\n\nMr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there? Must have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonder would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn't that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.\n\nPenrose! That was that chap's name.\n\nLook at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers. Tune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say. Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People ought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly's birthday. Hates sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.\n\nSense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched together. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the spring, the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can't taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.\n\nAnd with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have them all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his mind's eye. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair, for instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black. Then passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of white.\n\nPostoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer's just here too. Wait. Think over it.\n\nWith a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough. The belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick street. Perhaps to Levenston's dancing academy piano. Might be settling my braces.\n\nWalking by Doran's publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly. But I know it's whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to see.\n\nHe withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.\n\nPoor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would he have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being born that way? All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York. Holocaust. Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses. Dear, dear, dear. Pity, of course: but somehow you can't cotton on to them someway.\n\nSir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons' hall. Solemn as Troy. After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. Old legal cronies cracking a magnum. Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school. I sentenced him to ten years. I suppose he'd turn up his nose at that stuff I drank. Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle. Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder's court. Wellmeaning old man. Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime. Sends them to the rightabout. The devil on moneylenders. Gave Reuben J. a great strawcalling. Now he's really what they call a dirty jew. Power those judges have. Crusty old topers in wigs. Bear with a sore paw. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.\n\nHello, placard. Mirus bazaar. His Excellency the lord lieutenant. Sixteenth. Today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer's hospital. The Messiah was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out there: Ballsbridge. Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a leech. Wear out my welcome. Sure to know someone on the gate.\n\nMr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.\n\nStraw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.\n\nHis heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved to the right.\n\nIs it? Almost certain. Won't look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too heady. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Get on.\n\nMaking for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes. Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?\n\nDidn't see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.\n\nThe flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold statues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.\n\nNo. Didn't see me. After two. Just at the gate.\n\nMy heart!\n\nHis eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.\n\nLook for something I.\n\nHis hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded Agendath Netaim.

p.3 LyricsCumberland Plateau, Tennessee Valley and\nUnaka Mountains Region -\nBluegrass and String Band Music\n\nBluegrass and string band music has one of the most fiercely loyal audiences in American music.  Followers don't look at it so much as entertainment as they do a way of life.  You'll frequently see the makeup of these bands are family members, and many make it their life's work.  That kind of devotion says a lot about the values they see in the music. Whether it's history and tradition they hear, or that they hear it as a true expression of Americana, the performers and their audiences are passionate. You'll find a great presentation of this in a thesis by Leslie Blake Price entitled Bluegrass Nation: A Historical and Cultural Analysis of America's Truest Music.\n\nAny discussion of country or bluegrass music must acknow-ledge the contributions of the Carter Family.  They were one of the most influential groups in country music history, and they moved the emphasis from hillbilly instrumentals to \"folk stories in song\".  The original group consisted of A.P., his wife Sara, and her sister Maybelle.  They influenced all that followed in country and folk music, from Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Doc Watson all the way up to Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris and Ketch Secor.\n\nIt's unlikely that bluegrass music would exist today without the Carter Family's contributions. A.P. collected hundreds of Appalachian folk songs and rearranged them into the classics we have today.  They recorded hundreds of songs. but \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\", \"Wildwood Flower\", and \"Keep on the Sunny Side\" will give you a good sense of what their music did to build the folk tradition in country music.\n\nThat foundation work was built-up by those who followed.  In bluegrass, there are no better examples of where we are today today than Earl Skruggs' \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\", the Foggy Mountain Boys' \"Rollin' in My Sweet Baby's Arms\" or the Osborne Brothers' \"Rocky Top\", but here is a short list of more recent (and also great) examples of bluegrass and string music:Old Crow Medicine Show's \"Sweet Amarillo\"The SteelDrivers' \"Wearin' a Hole\"The Grascals' \"Old Friend of Mine\"Dailey & Vincent's \"Take Me Back (And Leave Me There)\"Aly Bain, Jerry Douglas and Russ Barenberg's\n\"St. Anne's Reel\"Wilson Banjo Company's \"95 Years\"Yonder Mountain String Band's \"Alison\"Top Ten Music Shrines in Tennessee\nIf you're into music and history, here are some great places to visit when you're in Tennessee:In the Coastal Plains region:Graceland - Memphis\nElvis promised his parents he'd build them the finest house in town, and put an end to years of struggle.

It's a full-immersion experience.Ryman Auditorium - Nashville\nThe first Grand Ole Opry started here in 1925. It's almost like being in a cathedral.Johnny Cash Museum - Nashville\nIt's captivating, real and raw - just like Cash himself.Jack Daniel's Distillery - Lynchburg\nWhat, you ask, does Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 have to do with Tennessee music?In the Cumberland/TN Valley/Unaka Mtns region:Cumberland Caverns - McMinnville\nBluegrass concerts are presented every month in the Volcano Room of Cumberland Caverns. They've been featured on NBC and PBS.Dollywood - Pigeon Forge\nThink of it as Disneyland with a bluegrass soundtrack.Birthplace of Country Music Museum - Bristol\nTells the story of the 1927 Bristol Sessions recordings that included the Carter Family and Jimmie RodgersTennessee Artists:Here's a list of some of the most famous musicians that were born in Tennessee or made the state their home. Each artist is listed with one - three songs to give you a sampler of their music. The list is long, but not comprehensive. Think of it as a primer.

I learn from you, I admire you and I love you.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis is a small hymn to an exaltation of women.\nR'lene Dahlberg fanned the embers.\nLisa Schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me.\nMary Breasted Smyth, elegant novelist herself, read the first third\nand passed it on to Molly Friedrich, who became my agent and thought that Nan Graham, Editor-in-Chief at Scribner, would be just the right person to put the book on the road.\nAnd Molly was right.\nMy daughter, Maggie, has shown me how life can be a grand adventure, while exquisite moments with my granddaughter, Chiara, have helped me recall a small child's wonder.\nMy wife, Ellen, listened while I read and cheered me to the final\npage.\nI am blessed among men.\n\nI\nMy father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born. Instead, they returned to Ireland when I was four, my brother, Malachy, three, the twins, Oliver and Eugene, barely one, and my sister, Margaret, dead and gone.\nWhen I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\nPeople everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years.\nAbove all-we were wet.\nOut in the Atlantic Ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick. The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve.\nIt created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges. It provoked cures galore; to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper; for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles, wrapped it in a rag, and slapped it, sizzling, on the chest.\nFrom October to April the walls of Limerick glistened with the damp. Clothes never dried: tweed and woolen coats housed living things, sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations. In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week's wages.\nThe rain drove us into the church-our refuge, our strength, our only dry place. At Mass, Benediction, novenas, we huddled in great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone, while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense, flowers and candles.\nLimerick gained a reputation for piety, but we knew it was only the\nrain.\nMy father, Malachy McCourt, was born on a farm in Toome, County\nAntrim. Like his father before, he grew up wild, in trouble with the English, or the Irish, or both. He fought with the Old IRA and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head.\nWhen I was a child I would look at my father, the thinning hair, the collapsing teeth, and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that. When I was thirteen my father's mother told me a secret: as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head. It was an accident, he was never the same after, and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar.\nBecause of the price on the head he had been dropped on, he had to be spirited out of Ireland via cargo ship from Galway. In New York, with Prohibition in full swing, he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins. Then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced.\nAfter wandering and drinking in America and England he yearned for peace in his declining years. He returned to Belfast, which erupted all around him. He said, A pox on all their houses, and chatted with the ladies of Andersontown. They tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea. He no longer smoked or touched alcohol, so what was the use? It was time to go and he died in the Royal Victoria Hospital.\nMy mother, the former Angela Sheehan, grew up in a Limerick slum with her mother, two brothers, Thomas and Patrick, and a sister, Agnes. She never saw her father, who had run off to Australia weeks before her birth.\nAfter a night of drinking porter in the pubs of Limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song, Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder?\nNobody spoke so he said it all the louder It's a dirty Irish trick and I can lick the Mick Who threw the overalls in Murphy's chowder.\nHe's in great form altogether and he thinks he'll play a while with little Patrick, one year old. Lovely little fella. Loves his daddy. Laughs when Daddy throws him up in the air. Upsy daisy, little Paddy, upsy daisy, up in the air in the dark, so dark, oh, Jasus, you miss the child on the way down and poor little Patrick lands on his head, gurgles\na bit, whimpers, goes quiet. Grandma heaves herself from the bed, heavy with the child in her belly, my mother. She's barely able to lift little Patrick from the floor. She moans a long moan over the child and turns on Grandpa. Get out of it. Out. If you stay here a minute longer I'll take the hatchet to you, you drunken lunatic. By Jesus, I'll swing at the end of a rope for you. Get out.\nGrandpa stands his ground like a man. I have a right, he says, to stay in me own house.\nShe runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside. He stumbles from the house, up the lane, and doesn't stop till he reaches Melbourne in Australia.\nLittle Pat, my uncle, was never the same after. He grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way, his body the other. He never learned to read or write but God blessed him in another way. When he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. No one knew why he was called Ab Sheehan, The Abbot, but all Limerick loved him.\nMy mother's troubles began the night she was born. There is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains, praying to St. Gerard Majella, patron saint of expectant mothers. There is Nurse O'Halloran, the midwife, all dressed up in her finery. It's New Year's Eve and Mrs. O'Halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations. She tells my grandmother: Will you push, will you, push. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph, if you don't hurry with this child it won't be born till the New Year and what good is that to me with me new dress? Never mind St. Gerard Majella. What can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint? St. Gerard Majella my arse.\nMy grandmother switches her prayers to St. Ann, patron saint of difficult labor. But the child won't come. Nurse O'Halloran tells my grandmother, Pray to St. Jude, patron saint of desperate cases.\nSt. Jude, patron of desperate cases, help me. I'm desperate. She grunts and pushes and the infant's head appears, only the head, my mother, and it's the stroke of midnight, the New Year. Limerick City erupts with whistles, horns, sirens, brass bands, people calling and singing, Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and church bells all over ring out the Angelus and Nurse O'Halloran weeps for the waste of a dress, that child still in there and me in me finery. Will you come out, child, will you? Grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world, a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes.\nAh, Lord above, says Nurse O'Halloran, this child is a time straddler, born with her head in the New Year and her arse in the Old or was it her head in the Old Year and her arse in the New. You'll have to write to the Pope, missus, to find out what year this child was born in and I'll save this dress for next year.\nAnd the child was named Angela for the Angelus which rang the midnight hour, the New Year, the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway.\nLove her as in childhood\nThough feeble, old and grey.\nFor you'll never miss a mother's love\nTill she's buried beneath the clay.\nAt the St. Vincent de Paul School, Angela learned to read, write, and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done. She tried her hand at being a charwoman, a skivvy, a maid with a little white hat opening doors, but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said, You don't have the knack of it. You're pure useless. Why don't you go to America where there's room for all sorts of uselessness? I'll give you the fare.\nShe arrived in New York just in time for the first Thanksgiving Day of the Great Depression. She met Malachy at a party given by Dan MacAdorey and his wife, Minnie, on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn. Malachy liked Angela and she liked him. He had a hangdog look, which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck. He and his friend John McErlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy, that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans. Neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along Myrtle Avenue they pulled it over. The police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing, not pork and beans, but cases of buttons.\nWith Angela drawn to the hangdog look and Malachy lonely after three months in jail, there was bound to be a knee-trembler.\nA knee-trembler is the act itself done up against a wall, man and woman up on their toes, straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that's in it.\nThat knee-trembler put Angela in an interesting condition and, of course, there was talk. Angela had cousins, the MacNamara sisters, Delia and Philomena, married, respectively, to Jimmy Fortune of County Mayo, and Tommy Flynn, of Brooklyn itself.\nDelia and Philomena were large women, great-breasted and fierce. When they sailed along the sidewalks of Brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside, respect was shown. The sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They knew that Angela, unmarried, had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps.\nSteps they took. With Jimmy and Tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where Malachy could be found on Friday, payday when he had a job. The man in the speak, Joey Cacciamani, did not want to admit the sisters but Philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he'd better open up for they were there on God's business. Joey said, Awright, awright, you Irish. Jeezoz! Trouble, trouble.\nMalachy, at the far end of the bar, turned pale, gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile, offered them a drink. They resisted the smile and spurned the offer. Delia said, We don't know what class of a tribe you come from in the North of Ireland.\nPhilomena said, There is a suspicion you might have Presbyterians in your family, which would explain what you did to our cousin.\nJimmy said, Ah, now, ah, now. 'Tisn't his fault if there's Presbyterians in his family.\nDelia said, You shuddup.\nTommy had to join in. What you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the Irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself.\nOch, I am, said Malachy. I am.\nNobody asked you to talk, said Philomena. You done enough damage with your blather, so shut your yap.\nAnd while your yap is shut, said Delia, we're here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin, Angela Sheehan.\nMalachy said, Och, indeed, indeed. The right thing is the right thing and I'd be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little\ntalk.\nTake the drink, said Tommy, and shove it up your ass.\nPhilomena said, Our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than\nyou are at her. We have morals in Limerick, you know, morals. We're not like jackrabbits from Antrim, a place crawling with Presbyterians.\nJimmy said, He don't look like a Presbyterian.\nYou shuddup, said Delia.\nAnother thing we noticed, said Philomena. You have a very odd\nmanner.\nMalachy smiled. I do?\nabout\nYou do, says Delia. I think 'tis one of the first things we noticed you, that odd manner, and it gives us a very uneasy feeling.\n'Tis that sneaky little Presbyterian smile, said Philomena.\nOch, said Malachy, it's just the trouble I have with my teeth. Teeth or no teeth, odd manner or no odd manner, you're gonna marry\nthat girl, said Tommy. Up the middle aisle you're going.\nOch, said Malachy, I wasn't planning to get married, you know.\nThere's no work and I wouldn't be able to support... Married is what you're going to be, said Delia. Up the middle aisle, said Jimmy.\nYou shuddup, said Delia.\nMalachy watched them leave. I'm in a desperate pickle, he told Joey Cacciamani.\nBet your ass, said Joey. I see them babes comin' at me I jump inna Hudson River.\nMalachy considered the pickle he was in. He had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in San Francisco or one of the other California Sans. Wouldn't he be better off in California, far from the great breasted MacNamara sisters and their grim husbands? He would, indeed, and he'd have a drop of the Irish to celebrate his decision and departure. Joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off Malachy's gullet. Irish, indeed! He told Joey it was a Prohibition concoction from the devil's own still. Joey shrugged. I don't know nothing. I only pour. Still, it was better than nothing and Malachy would have another and one for yourself, Joey, and ask them two decent Italians what they'd like and what are you talking about, of course, I have the money to pay for it.\nHe awoke on a bench in the Long Island Railroad Station, a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick, his escape money gone, the MacNamara sisters ready to eat him alive in Brooklyn.\nOn the feast of St. Joseph, a bitter day in March, four months after the knee-trembler, Malachy married Angela and in August the child was born. In November Malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child's birth. He thought he might name the child Malachy, after himself, but his North of Ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name Male on the certificate.\nNot until late December did they take Male to St. Paul's Church to be baptized and named Francis after his father's father and the lovely saint of Assisi. Angela wanted to give him a middle name, Munchin, after the patron saint of Limerick but Malachy said over his dead body. No son of his would have a Limerick name. It's hard enough going through life with one name. Sticking on middle names was an atrocious American habit and there was no need for a second name when you're christened after the man from Assisi.\nThere was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather, John McErlaine, got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities. Philomena told her husband, Tommy, he'd have to be godfather. Child's soul is in danger, she said. Tommy put his head down and grumbled. All right. I'll be godfather but I'm not goin' to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin' trouble and goin' through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to John McErlaine at the speakeasy. The priest said, True for you, Tom, decent man that you are, fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy. Malachy, fresh from the speakeasy himself, felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest, one sacrilege on top of another. Take off that collar and we'll see who's the man. He had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim. Angela, new mother, agitated, forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font, a total immersion of the Protestant type. The altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to Angela, who sobbed and clutched him, dripping, to her bosom. The priest laughed, said he had never seen the likes, that the child was a regular little Baptist now and hardly needed a priest. This maddened Malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a Protestant. The priest said, Quiet, man, you're in God's house, and when Malachy said, God's house, my arse, he was thrown out on Court Street because you can't say arse in God's house.\nAfter baptism Philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner. Malachy said, Tea? and she said, Yes, tea, or is it whiskey you want? He said tea was grand but first he'd have to go and deal with John McErlaine, who didn't have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather. Angela said, You're only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy, and he said, As God is my witness, the drink is the last thing on my mind. Angela started to cry. Your son's christening day and you have to go drinking. Delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the North of Ireland.\nMalachy looked from one to the other, shifted on his feet, pulled his cap down over his eyes, shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets, said, Och, aye, the way they do in the far reaches of County Antrim, turned, hurried up Court Street to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where he was sure they'd ply him with free drink in honor of his son's baptism.\nAt Philomena's house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while Angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying. Philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at Angela, That's what you get for being such a fool. Hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic. You shoulda stayed single, put the child up for adoption, and you'd be a free woman today. Angela cried harder and Delia took up the attack, Oh, stop it, Angela, stop it. You have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin' into trouble with a drunkard from the North, a man that doesn't even look like a Catholic, him with his odd manner. I'd say\nthat... that... Malachy has a streak of the Presbyterian in him right enough. You shuddup, Jimmy.\nIf I was you, said Philomena, I'd make sure there's no more children. He don't have a job, so he don't, an' never will the way he drinks. So... no more children, Angela. Are you listenin' to me?\nI am, Philomena.\nA year later another child was born. Angela called him Malachy after his father and gave him a middle name, Gerard, after his father's brother.\nThe MacNamara sisters said Angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses.\nTheir husbands agreed.\nI'm in a playground on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn with my brother, Malachy. He's two, I'm three. We're on the seesaw.\nUp, down, up, down.\nMalachy goes up.\nI get off.\nMalachy goes down. Seesaw hits the ground. He screams. His hand is\non his mouth and there's blood.\nOh, God. Blood is bad. My mother will kill me.\nAnd here she is, trying to run across the playground. Her big belly\nslows her.\nShe says, What did you do? What did you do to I don't know what to say. I don't know what I She pulls my ear. Go home. Go to bed. Bed?\nIn the middle of the day?\nShe pushes me toward the playground gate. Go. She picks up Malachy and waddles off.\nMy father's friend, Mr. MacAdorey, is outside\nthe child?\ndid.\nour building. He's standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife, Minnie, looking at a\ndog lying in the gutter. There is blood all around the dog's head. It's the color of the blood from Malachy's mouth.\nMalachy has dog blood and the dog has Malachy blood.\nI pull Mr. MacAdorey's hand. I tell him Malachy has blood like the\ndog.\nOh, he does, indeed, Francis. Cats have it, too. And Eskimos. All\nthe same blood.\nMinnie says, Stop that, Dan. Stop confusing the wee fellow. She\ntells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died. Wanted to come home, the poor wee creature.\nMr. MacAdorey says, You'd better go home, Francis. I don't know what you did to your wee brother, but your mother took him off to the hospital. Go home, child.\nWill Malachy die like the dog, Mr. MacAdorey? Minnie says, He bit his tongue. He won't die. Why did the dog die?\nIt was his time, Francis.\nThe apartment is empty and I wander between the two rooms, the bedroom and the kitchen. My father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with Malachy. I wish I had something to eat but there's nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice. My father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it. I fall asleep on my parents' bed and when my mother\nshakes me it's nearly dark. Your little brother is going to sleep a while. Nearly bit his tongue off. Stitches galore. Go into the other\nroom.\nMy father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white\nenamel mug. He lifts me to his lap.\nDad, will you tell me the story about Coo Coo?\nCuchulain. Say it after me, Coo-hoo-lin. I'll tell you the story\nwhen you say the name right. Coo-hoo-lin.\nI say it right and he tells me the story of Cuchulain, who had a\ndifferent name when he was a boy, Setanta. He grew up in Ireland where Dad lived when he was a boy in County Antrim. Setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to Culain and choked him. Oh, Culain was angry and he said, What am I to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs, hens, sheep?\nSetanta said, I'm sorry. I'll guard your house with my stick and ball and I'll change my name to Cuchulain, the Hound of Culain. He did. He guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero, the Hound of Ulster itself. Dad said he was a greater hero than Hercules or Achilles that the Greeks were always bragging about and he could take on King Arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which, of course, you could never get with an Englishman anyway.\nThat's my story. Dad can't tell that story to Malachy or any other children down the hall.\nHe finishes the story and lets me sip his tea. It's bitter, but I'm happy there on his lap.\nFor days Malachy's tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk. But even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night. The neighbors say, Ooh, Ah, they're lovely boys, look at those big eyes.\nMalachy stands in the middle of the room, looking up at everyone, pointing to his tongue and saying, Uck, uck. When the neighbors say, Can't you see we're looking at your little brothers? he cries, till Dad pats him on the head. Put in your tongue, son, and go out and play with Frankie. Go on.\nIn the playground I tell Malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth. Malachy shakes his head. No uck ball. Car uck kill dog. He cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it's terrible when you can't talk. He won't let me push him on the swing. He says, You uck kill me uck on seesaw. He gets Freddie Leibowitz to push him and he's happy, laughing when he swings to the sky. Freddie is big, he's seven, and I ask him to push me. He says, No, you tried to kill your brother.\nI try to get the swing going myself but all I can do is move it back and forth and I'm angry because Freddie and Malachy are laughing at the way I can't swing. They're great pals now, Freddie, seven, Malachy, two. They laugh every day and Malachy's tongue gets better with all the laughing.\nWhen he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine. He has blue eyes like my mother. He has golden hair and pink cheeks. I have brown eyes like Dad. I have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror. My mother tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall that Malachy is the happiest child in the world.\nShe tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall, Frankie has the odd manner like his father. I wonder what the odd manner is but I can't ask because I'm not supposed to be listening.\nI wish I could swing up into the sky, up into the clouds. I might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers, Oliver and Eugene, cry in the middle of the night anymore. My mother says they're always hungry. She cries in the middle of the night, too. She says she's worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her. She wishes she had one little girl all for herself. She'd give anything for one little girl.\nI'm in the playground with Malachy. I'm four, he's three. He lets me push him on the swing because he's no good at swinging himself and Freddie Leibowitz is in school. We have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she's worn out. Go out and play, she says, and give me some rest. Dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey, singing all the songs about suffering Ireland. Mam gets angry and says Ireland can kiss her arse. He says that's nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language, food on the table is what she wants, not suffering Ireland. She says it was a sad day Prohibition ended because Dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer. Sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch, rye bread, corned beef, pickles. He puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself. He says food is a shock to the system and he doesn't know where we get our appetites. Mam\nsays,\nThey get their appetites because they're starving half the time.\nWhen Dad gets a job Mam is cheerful and she sings, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,\nIt had to be and the reason is this\nCould it be true, someone like you\nCould love me, love me?\nWhen Dad brings home the first week's wages Mam is delighted she can pay the lovely Italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there's nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone. She cleans the kitchen, washes the mugs and plates, brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table, cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another Italian. She buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that, she says, is better than having the headlines from the Daily News blackening your arse. She boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks, diapers for the twins, our two sheets, our three towels. She hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun. She says you wouldn't want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there's nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun.\nWhen Dad brings home the first week's wages on a Friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful. On Saturday night Mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and Dad will dry us. Malachy will turn around and show his behind. Dad will pretend to be shocked and we'll all laugh. Mam will make hot cocoa and we'll be able to stay up while Dad tells us a story out of his head. All we have to do is\nsay a name, Mr. MacAdorey or Mr. Leibowitz down the hall, and Dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in Brazil chased by Indians with green noses and puce shoulders. On nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs, fried tomatoes and fried bread, tea with lashings of sugar and milk and, later in the day, a big dinner of mashed potatoes, peas and ham, and a trifle Mam makes, layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry.\nWhen Dad brings home the first week's wages and the weather is fine Mam takes us to the playground. She sits on a bench and talks to Minnie MacAdorey. She tells Minnie stories about characters in Limerick and Minnie tells her about characters in Belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in Ireland, North and South. Then they teach each other sad songs and Malachy and I leave the swings and see-saws to sit with them on the bench and sing, A group of young soldiers one night in a camp Were talking of sweethearts they had.\nAll seemed so merry except one young lad, And he was downhearted and sad.\nCome and join us, said one of the boys, Surely there's someone for you.\nBut Ned shook his head and proudly he said I am in love with two, Each like a mother to me,\nFrom neither of them shall I part.\nFor one is my mother,\nGod bless her and love her,\nThe other is my sweetheart.\nMalachy and I sing that song and Mam and Minnie laugh till they cry at the way Malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to Mam at the end. Dan MacAdorey comes along on his way home from work and says Rudy Vallee better start worrying about the competition.\nWhen we go home Mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt. Dad drinks the tea and eats nothing. Mam says, God above, How can you work all day and not eat? He says, The tea is enough. She says, You'll ruin your health, and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system. He drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the Daily News or he smokes a cigarette, stares at the wall, runs his tongue over his lips.\nWhen Dad's job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages. On Friday night we wait for him and Mam gives us bread and tea. The darkness comes down and the lights come on along Classon Avenue. Other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can't have meat on a Friday. You can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and Bing Crosby is singing on the radio, Brother, can you spare a dime?\nMalachy and I play with the twins. We know Mam won't sing Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table talking to herself, What am I going to do? till it's late and Dad rolls up the stairs singing Roddy McCorley. He pushes in the door and calls for us, Where are my troops? Where are my four warriors?\nMam says, Leave those boys alone. They're gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey.\nHe comes to the bedroom door. Up, boys, up. A nickel for everyone who promises to die for Ireland.\nDeep in Canadian woods we met\nFrom one bright island flown.\nGreat is the land we tread, but yet\nOur hearts are with our own.\nUp, boys, up. Francis, Malachy, Oliver, Eugene. The Red Branch Knights, the Fenian Men, the IRA. Up, up.\nMam is at the kitchen table, shaking, her hair hanging damp, her face wet. Can't you leave them alone? she says. Jesus, Mary and Joseph,\nisn't it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it? She comes to us. Go back to bed, she\nI want them up, he says. I want them\nbe free from the center to the sea.\nDon't cross me, she says, for if you your mother's house.\na penny in your pocket without\nsays.\nready for the day Ireland will\ndo it'll be a sorry day in\nHe pulls his cap down over his face and cries, My poor mother. Poor Ireland. Och, what are we going to do?\nMam says, You're pure stone mad, and she tells us again to go to bed.\nOn the morning of the fourth Friday of Dad's job Mam asks him if he'll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again? He looks at us and shakes his head at Mam as if to say, Och, you shouldn't talk like that in front of the children.\nMam keeps at him. I'm asking you, Are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing Kevin Barry and the rest of the sad songs?\nHe puts on his cap, shoves his hands into his trouser pockets, sighs and looks up at the ceiling. I told you before I'll be home, he\nsays.\nLater in the day Mam dresses us. She puts the twins into the pram\nand off we go through the long streets of Brooklyn. Sometimes she lets Malachy sit in the pram when he's tired of trotting along beside her. She tells me I'm too big for the pram. I could tell her I have pains in my legs from trying to keep up with her but she's not singing and I know this is not the day to be talking about my pains.\nWe come to a big gate where there's a man standing in a box with windows all around. Mam talks to the man. She wants to know if she can go inside to where the men are paid and maybe they'd give her some of Dad's wages so he wouldn't spend it in the bars. The man shakes his head. I'm sorry, lady, but if we did that we'd have half the wives in Brooklyn storming the place. Lotta men have the drinking problem but there's nothing we can do long as they show up sober and do their work.\nWe wait across the street. Mam lets me sit on the sidewalk with my back against the wall. She gives the twins their bottles of water and sugar but Malachy and I have to wait till she gets money from Dad and we can go to the Italian for tea and bread and eggs.\nWhen the whistle blows at half five men in caps and overalls swarm through the gate, their faces and hands black from the work. Mam tells us watch carefully for Dad because she can hardly see across the street\nherself, her eyes are that bad. There are dozens of men, then a few, then none. Mam is crying, Why couldn't ye see him? Are ye blind or what?\nShe goes back to the man in the box. Are you sure there wouldn't be one man left inside?\nNo, lady, he says. They're out. I don't know how he got past you.\nWe go back through the long streets of Brooklyn. The twins hold up their bottles and cry for more water and sugar. Malachy says he's hungry and Mam tells him wait a little, we'll get money from Dad and we'll all have a nice supper. We'll go to the Italian and get eggs and make toast with the flames on the stove and we'll have jam on it. Oh, we will, and we'll all be nice and warm.\nIt's dark on Atlantic Avenue and all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station are bright and noisy. We go from bar to bar looking for Dad. Mam leaves us outside with the pram while she goes in or she sends me. There are crowds of noisy men and stale smells that remind me of Dad when he comes home with the smell of the whiskey on him.\nThe man behind the bar says, Yeah, sonny, whaddya want? You're not supposeta be in here, y'know.\nI'm looking for my father. Is my father here?\nNaw, sonny, how'd I know dat? Who's your fawdah?\nHis name is Malachy and he sings Kevin Barry.\nMalarkey?\nNo, Malachy.\nMalachy? And he sings Kevin Barry?\nHe calls out to the men in the bar, Youse guys, youse know guy\nMalachy what sings Kevin Barry?\nMen shake their heads. One says he knew a guy Michael sang Kevin\nBarry but he died of the drink which he had because of his war wounds. The barman says, Jeez, Pete, I didn't ax ya to tell me history o'\nda woild, did I? Naw, kid. We don't let people sing in here. Causes trouble. Specially the Irish. Let 'em sing, next the fists are flying. Besides, I never hoid a name like dat Malachy. Naw, kid, no Malachy here.\nThe man called Pete holds his glass toward me. Here, kid, have a sip, but the barman says, Whaddya doin', Pete? Tryina get the kid drunk? Do that again, Pete, an' I'll come out an' break y'ass.\nMam tries all the bars around the station before she gives up. She leans against a wall and cries. Jesus, we still have to walk all the way to Classon Avenue and I have four starving children. She sends me back into the bar where Pete offered me the sip to see if the barman would fill the twins' bottles with water and maybe a little sugar in each. The men in the bar think it's very funny that the barman should be filling baby bottles but he's big and he tells them shut their lip. He tells me babies should be drinking milk not water and when I tell him Mam doesn't have the money he empties the baby bottles and fills them with milk. He says, Tell ya mom they need that for the teeth an' bones. Ya drink water an' sugar an' all ya get is rickets. Tell ya Mom.\nMam is happy with the milk. She says she knows all about teeth and bones and rickets but beggars can't be choosers.\nWhen we reach Classon Avenue she goes straight to the Italian grocery shop. She tells the man her husband is late tonight, that he's probably working overtime, and would it be at all possible to get a few things and she'll be sure to see him tomorrow?\nThe Italian says, Missus, you always pay your bill sooner or later and you can have anything you like in this store.\nOh, she says, I don't want much.\nAnything you like, missus, because I know you're an honest woman and you got a bunch o' nice kids there.\nWe have eggs and toast and jam though we're so weary walking the long streets of Brooklyn we can barely move our jaws to chew. The twins fall asleep after eating and Mam lays them on the bed to change their diapers. She sends me down the hall to rinse the dirty diapers in the lavatory so that they can be hung up to dry and used the next day. Malachy helps her wash the twins' bottoms though he's ready to fall asleep himself.\nI crawl into bed with Malachy and the twins. I look out at Mam at the kitchen table, smoking a cigarette, drinking tea, and crying. I want to get up and tell her I'll be a man soon and I'll get a job in the place with the big gate and I'll come home every Friday night with money for eggs and toast and jam and she can sing again Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss.\nThe next week Dad loses the job. He comes home that Friday night, throws his wages on the table and says to Mam, Are you happy now? You hang around the gate complaining and accusing and they sack me. They were looking for an excuse and you gave it to them.\nHe takes a few dollars from his wages and goes out. He comes home late roaring and singing. The twins cry and Mam shushes them and cries a long time herself.\nWe spend hours in the playground when the twins are sleeping, when Mam is tired, and when Dad comes home with the whiskey smell on him, roaring about Kevin Barry getting hanged on a Monday morning or the Roddy McCorley song, Up the narrow street he stepped Smiling and proud and young About the hemp rope on his neck The golden ringlets clung, There's never a tear in the blue eyes Both glad and bright are they, As Roddy McCorley goes to die On the bridge of Toome today.\nWhen he sings he marches around the table, Mam cries and the twins howl with her. She says, Go out, Frankie, go out, Malachy. You shouldn't see your father like this. Stay in the playground. We don't mind going to the playground.\nWe can play with the leaves piling up on the ground and we can push each other on the swings but then winter comes to Classon Avenue and the swings are frozen and won't even move. Minnie MacAdorey says, God help these poor wee boys.\nThey don't have a glove between them. That makes me laugh because I know Malachy and I have four hands between us and one glove would be silly. Malachy doesn't know what I'm laughing at: He won't know anything till he's four going on five.\nMinnie brings us in and gives us tea and porridge with jam in it. Mr. MacAdorey sits in an armchair with their new baby, Maisie. He holds her bottle and sings, Clap hands, clap hands, Till Daddy comes home, With buns in his pocket For Maisie alone.\nClap hands, clap hands,\nTill Daddy comes home,\nFor Daddy has money\nAnd Mammy has none.\nMalachy tries to sing that song but I tell him stop, it's Maisie's song. He starts to cry and Minnie says, There, there. You can sing the\nsong.\nand I\nsong.\nThat's a song for all the children. Mr. MacAdorey smiles at Malachy wonder what kind of world is it where anyone can sing anyone else's\nMinnie says, Don't frown, Frankie. It makes your face dark and God it's dark enough. Some day you'll have a little sister and you can\nknows\nsing that song to her. Och, aye. You'll have a little sister, surely.\nMinnie is right and Mam gets her wish. There's a new baby soon, a little girl, and they call her Margaret. We all love Margaret. She has black curly hair and blue eyes like Mam and she waves her little hands and chirps like any little bird in the trees along Classon Avenue. Minnie says there was a holiday in heaven the day this child was made. Mrs. Leibowitz says the world never saw such eyes, such a smile, such happiness. She makes me dance, says Mrs. Leibowitz.\nsings\nWhen Dad comes home from looking for a job he holds Margaret and to her: In a shady nook one moonlit night A leprechaun I spied.\nWith scarlet cap and coat of green\nA cruiskeen by his side.\n'Twas tick tock tick his hammer went Upon a tiny shoe.\nOh, I laugh to think he was caught at last, But the fairy was laughing, too.\nHe walks around the kitchen with her and talks to her. He tells her how lovely she is with her curly black hair and the blue eyes of her mother. He tells her he'll take her to Ireland and they'll walk the Glens of Antrim and swim in Lough Neagh. He'll get a job soon, so he will, and she'll have dresses of silk and shoes with silver buckles.\nThe more Dad sings to Margaret the less she cries and as the days pass she even begins to laugh. Mam says, Look at him trying to dance with that child in his arms, him with his two left feet. She laughs and we all laugh.\nThe twins cried when they were small and Dad and Mam would say Whisht and Hush and feed them and they'd go back to sleep. But when Margaret cries there's a high lonely feeling in the air and Dad is out of bed in a second, holding her to him, doing a slow dance around the table, singing to her, making sounds like a mother. When he passes the window where the streetlight shines in you can see tears on his cheeks and that's strange because he never cries for anyone unless he has the drink taken and he sings the Kevin Barry song and the Roddy McCorley song. Now he cries over Margaret and he has no smell of drink on him.\nMam tells Minnie MacAdorey, He's in heaven over that child. He hasn't touched a drop since she was born. I should've had a little girl a long time ago.\nOch, they're lovely, aren't they? says Minnie. The little boys are grand, too, but you need a little girl for yourself.\nMy mother laughs, For myself? Lord above, if I didn't nurse her I wouldn't be able to get near her the way he wants to be holding her day and night.\nMinnie says it's lovely, all the same, to see a man so charmed with his little girl for isn't everyone charmed with her?\nEveryone.\nThe twins are able to stand and walk and they have accidents all the time. Their bottoms are sore because they're always wet and shitty. They put dirty things in their mouths, bits of paper, feathers, shoelaces, and they get sick. Mam says we're all driving her crazy. She dresses the twins, puts them in the pram, and Malachy and I take them to the playground. The cold weather is gone and the trees have green leaves up and down Classon Avenue.\nWe race the pram around the playground and the twins laugh and make goo-goo sounds till they get hungry and start to cry. There are two bottles in the pram filled with water and sugar and that keeps them quiet for awhile till they're hungry again and they cry so hard I don't know what to do because they're so small and I wish I could give them all kinds of food so that they'd laugh and make the baby sounds. They love the mushy food Mam makes in a pot, bread mashed up in milk and water and sugar. Mam calls it bread and goody.\nIf I take the twins home now Mam will yell at me for giving her no rest or for waking Margaret. We are to stay in the playground till she sticks her head out the window and calls for us. I make funny faces for the twins to stop their crying. I put a piece of paper on my head and let it fall and they laugh and laugh. I push the pram over to Malachy playing on the swings with Freddie Leibowitz. Malachy is trying to tell Freddie all about the way Setanta became Cuchulain. I tell him stop telling that story, it's my story. He won't stop. I push him and he cries, Waah, waah, I'll tell Mam. Freddie pushes me and everything turns dark in my head and I run at him with fists and knees and feet till he yells, Hey, stop, stop, and I won't because I can't, I don't know how, and if I stop Malachy will go on taking my story from me. Freddie pushes me away and runs off, yelling, Frankie tried to kill me. Frankie tried to kill me. I don't know what to do because I never tried to kill anyone before and now Malachy, on the swing, cries, Don't kill me, Frankie, and he looks so helpless I put my arms around him and help him off the swing. He hugs me. I won't tell your story anymore. I won't tell Freddie about Coo, Coo. I want to laugh but I can't because the twins are crying in the pram and it's dark in the playground and what's the use of trying to make funny faces and letting things fall off your head when they can't see you in the dark?\nThe Italian grocery shop is across the street and I see bananas, apples, oranges. I know the twins can eat bananas. Malachy loves bananas and I like them myself. But you need money, Italians are not known for giving away bananas especially to the McCourts who owe them money already for groceries.\nMy mother tells me all the time, Never, never leave that playground except to come home. But what am I to do with the twins bawling with the hunger in the pram? I tell Malachy I'll be back in a minute. I make sure no one is looking, grab a bunch of bananas outside the Italian grocery shop and run down Myrtle Avenue, away from the playground, around the block and back to the other end where there's a hole in the fence. We push the pram to a dark corner and peel the bananas for the twins. There are five bananas in the bunch and we feast on them in the dark corner. The twins slobber and chew and spread banana over their faces, their hair, their clothes. I realize then that questions will be asked. Mam will want to know why the twins are smothered in bananas, where did you get them? I can't tell her about the Italian shop on the corner. I will have to say, A man.\nThat's what I'll say. A man.\nThen the strange thing happens. There's a man at the gate of the playground. He's calling me. Oh, God, it's the Italian. Hey, sonny, come 'ere. Hey, talkin' to ya. Come 'ere.\nI go to him.\nYou the kid wid the little bruddas, right? Twins?\nYes, sir.\nHeah. Gotta bag o' fruit. I don' give it to you I trow id out.\nRight? So, heah, take the bag. Ya got apples, oranges, bananas. Ya like bananas, right? I think ya like bananas, eh? Ha, ha. I know ya like the bananas. Heah, take the bag. Ya gotta nice mother there. Ya father? Well, ya know, he's got the problem, the Irish thing. Give them twins a banana. Shud 'em up. I hear 'em all the way cross the street.\nThank you, sir.\nJeez. Polite kid, eh? Where ja loin dat?\nMy father told me to say thanks, sir.\nYour father? Oh, well.\nDad sits at the table reading the paper. He says that President\nRoosevelt is a good man and everyone in America will soon have a job. Mam is on the other side of the table feeding Margaret with a bottle. She has the hard look that frightens me.\nWhere did you get that fruit?\nThe man.\nWhat man?\nThe Italian man gave it to me.\nDid you steal that fruit?\nMalachy says, The man. The man\nAnd what did you do to Freddie\nLovely woman. I don't know what we'd\nAnd you had to attack poor Freddie.\ngave Frankie the bag.\nLeibowitz? His mother was here.\ndo without her and Minnie MacAdorey.\nMalachy jumps up and down. He din't. He din't. Din't try to kill Freddie. Din't try to kill me.\nDad says, Whisht, Malachy, whisht. Come over here. And he takes Malachy on his lap.\nMy mother says, Go down the hall and tell Freddie you're sorry.\nBut Dad says, Do you want to tell Freddie you're sorry?\nI don't.\nMy parents look at one another. Dad says, Freddie is a good boy. He\nwas only pushing your little brother on the swing. Isn't that right? He was trying to steal my Cuchulain story.\nOch, now. Freddie doesn't care about the Cuchulain story. He has\nhis own story. Hundreds of stories. He's Jewish. What's Jewish?\nDad laughs. Jewish is, Jewish is people with their own stories. They don't need Cuchulain. They have Moses. They have Samson.\nWhat's Samson?\nIf you go down and talk to Freddie I'll tell you about Samson later. You can tell Freddie you're sorry and you'll never do it again and you can even ask him about Samson. Anything you like as long as you talk to Freddie. Will you?\nThe baby gives a little cry in my mother's arms and Dad jumps up, dropping Malachy to the floor. Is she all right? My mother says, Of course she's all right. She's feeding. God above, you're a bundle of nerves.\nThey're talking about Margaret now and I'm forgotten. I don't care. I'm going down the hall to ask Freddie about Samson, to see if Samson is as good as Cuchulain, to see if Freddie has his own story or if he still wants to steal Cuchulain. Malachy wants to go with me now that my father is standing and doesn't have a lap anymore.\nMrs. Leibowitz says, Oh, Frankie, Frankie, come in, come in. And little Malachy. And tell me, Frankie, what did you do to Freddie? Tried to kill him? Freddie is a good boy, Frankie. Reads his book. Listens to radio with his papa. He swinks you brother on swink. And you try to kill him. Oh, Frankie, Frankie. And you poor mother and her sick baby.\nShe's not sick, Mrs. Leibowitz.\nSick she is. Zat is one sick baby. I know from sick babies. I work in hoztipal. Don't tell me, Frankie. Come in, come in. Freddie, Freddie, Frankie is here. Come out. Frankie won't kill you no more. You and little Malachy. Nice Chewish name, have piece cake, eh? Why they give you a Chewish name, eh? So, glass milk, piece cake. You boys so thin, Irish don't eat.\nWe sit at the table with Freddie, eating cake, drinking milk. Mr. Leibowitz sits in an armchair reading the paper, listening to the radio. Sometimes he speaks to Mrs. Leibowitz and I don't understand because strange sounds come from his mouth. Freddie understands. When Mr. Leibowitz makes the strange sounds Freddie gets up and takes him a piece of cake. Mr. Leibowitz smiles at Freddie and pats his head and Freddie smiles back and makes the strange sounds.\nMrs. Leibowitz shakes her head at Malachy and me. Oy, so thin. She says Oy so much Malachy laughs and says Oy and the Leibowitzes laugh and Mr. Leibowitz says words we can understand, When Irish oyes are smiling. Mrs. Leibowitz laughs so hard her body shakes and she holds her stomach and Malachy says Oy again because he knows that makes everyone laugh. I say Oy but no one laughs and I know Oy belongs to Malachy the way Cuchulain belongs to me and Malachy can have his Oy.\nMrs. Leibowitz, my father said Freddie has a favorite story.\nMalachy says, Sam, Sam, Oy. Everyone laughs again but I don't because I can't remember what comes after Sam. Freddie mumbles through his cake, Samson, and Mrs. Leibowitz tells him, Don't talk wiz you mouse full, and I laugh because she's grown-up and she says mouse instead of mouth. Malachy laughs because I laugh and the Leibowitzes look at each other and smile. Freddie says, Not Samson. My favorite story is David and the giant, Goliath. David killed him dead with a slingshot, a stone in his head. His brains was on the ground.\nWere on the ground, says Mr. Leibowitz.\nYes, Papa. Papa.\nThat's what Freddie calls his father and Dad is what I call my\nfather.\nMy mother's whisper wakes me. What's up with the child? It's still\nearly and there isn't much morning in the room but you can see Dad over by the window with Margaret in his arms. He's rocking her and sighing,\nOch.\nMam says, Is she, is she sick?\nOch, she's very quiet and she's a wee bit cold.\nMy mother is out of the bed, taking the child. Go for the doctor.\nGo for God's sake, and my father is pulling on his trousers over his shirt, no jacket, shoes, no socks on this bitter day.\nWe wait in the room, the twins asleep at the bottom of the bed, Malachy stirring beside me. Frankie, I want a drink of water. Mam rocks in her bed with the baby in her arms. Oh, Margaret, Margaret, my own little love. Open your lovely blue eyes, my little leanv.\nI fill a cup of water for Malachy and me and my mother wails, Water for you and your brother. Oh, indeed, Water, is it? And nothing for your sister. Your poor little sister. Did you ask if she had a mouth in her head? Did you ask if she'd like a drop of water? Oh, no. Go on and drink your water, you and your brother, as if nothing happened. A regular day for the two of you, isn't it? And the twins sleeping away as if they didn't have a care and their poor little sister sick here in my arms. Sick in my arms. Oh, sweet Jesus in heaven.\nWhy is she talking like this? She's not talking like my mother today. I want my father. Where is my father?\nI get back into bed and start to cry. Malachy says, Why you cry? Why you cry? till Mam is at me again. Your sister is sick in my arms and you're there whining and whinging. If I go over to that bed I'll give you something to whinge about.\nDad is back with the doctor. Dad has the whiskey smell. The doctor examines the baby, prods her, raises her eyelids, feels her neck, arms, legs. He straightens up and shakes his head. She's gone. Mam reaches for the baby, hugs her, turns to the wall. The doctor wants to know, Was there any kind of accident? Did anyone drop the baby? Did the boys play too hard with her? Anything?\nMy father shakes his head. Doctor says he'll have to take her to examine her and Dad signs a paper. My mother begs for another few minutes with her baby but the doctor says he doesn't have all day. When Dad reaches for Margaret my mother pulls away against the wall. She has the wild look, her black curly hair is damp on her forehead and there is sweat all over her face, her eyes are wide open and her face is shiny with tears, she keeps shaking her head and moaning, Ah, no, ah, no, till Dad eases the baby from her arms. The doctor wraps Margaret completely in a blanket and my mother cries, Oh, Jesus, you'll smother her. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me. The doctor leaves. My mother turns to the wall and doesn't make a move or sound. The twins are awake, crying with the hunger, but Dad stands in the middle of the room, staring at the ceiling. His face is white and he beats on his thighs with his fists. He comes to the bed, puts his hand on my head. His hand is shaking. Francis, I'm going out for cigarettes.\nMam stays in the bed all day, hardly moving. Malachy and I fill the twins' bottles with water and sugar. In the kitchen we find a half loaf of stale bread and two cold sausages. We can't have tea because the milk is sour in the icebox where the ice is melted again and everyone knows you can't drink tea without milk unless your father gives it to you out of his mug while he's telling you about Cuchulain.\nThe twins are hungry again but I know I can't give them water and sugar all day and night. I boil sour milk in a pot, mash in some of the stale bread, and try to feed them from a cup, bread and goody. They make faces and run to Mam's bed, crying. She keeps her face to the wall and they run back to me, still crying. They won't eat the bread and goody till I kill the taste of the sour milk with sugar. Now they eat and smile and rub the goody over their faces. Malachy wants some and if he can eat it, so can I. We all sit on the floor eating the goody and chewing on the\ncold sausage and drinking water my mother keeps in a milk bottle in the icebox.\nAfter we eat and drink we have to go to the lavatory down the hall but we can't get in because Mrs. Leibowitz is inside, humming and singing. She says, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Won't be two seconds. Malachy claps his hands and dances around, singing, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Mrs. Leibowitz opens the lavatory door. Look at him. Little actor awready. So, chiltren, how's you mother?\nShe's in bed, Mrs. Leibowitz. The doctor took Margaret and my father went for cigarettes.\nOh, Frankie, Frankie. I said that was one sick child.\nMalachy is clutching himself. Have to pee. Have to pee.\nSo, pee awready. You boys pee and we see you mother.\nAfter we pee Mrs. Leibowitz comes to see Mam. Oh, Mrs. McCourt. Oy\nvey, darlink. Look at this. Look at these twins. Naked. Mrs. McCourt, what is mazzer, eh? The baby she is sick? So talk to me. Poor woman. Here turn around, missus. Talk to me. Oy, this is one mess. Talk to me, Mrs. McCourt.\nShe helps my mother sit up against the wall. Mam seems smaller. Mrs. Leibowitz says she'll bring some soup and tells me get some water to wash my mother's face. I dip a towel in cold water and pat her forehead. She presses my hand against her cheeks. Oh, Jesus, Frankie. Oh, Jesus. She won't let my hand go and I'm frightened because I've never seen her like this before. She's saying Frankie only because it's my hand she's holding and it's Margaret she's thinking about, not me. Your lovely little sister is dead, Frankie. Dead. And where is your father? She lets my hand drop. I said where is your father? Drinking. That's where he is. There isn't a penny in the house. He can't get a job but he finds money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink. She rears back, knocks her head on the wall and screams, Where is she? Where is she? Where is my little girl? Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me this night. I'll go mad, so I will, I'll go pure mad.\nMrs. Leibowitz rushes in. Missus, missus, what is it? The little girl. Where is she?\nMy mother screams again, Dead, Mrs. Leibowitz. Dead. Her head drops and she rocks back and forth. Middle of the night, Mrs. Leibowitz. In her pram. I should have been watching her. Seven weeks she had in this world and died in the middle of the night, alone, Mrs. Leibowitz, all alone in that pram.\nMrs. Leibowitz holds my mother in her arms. Shush, now, shush. Babies go like that. It happens, missus. God takes them.\nIn the pram, Mrs. Leibowitz. Near my bed. I could have picked her up and she didn't have to die, did she? God doesn't want little babies. What is God going to do with little babies?\nI don't know, missus. I don't know from God. Have soup. Good soup. Make you strong. You boys. Get bowls. I give you soup.\nWhat's bowls, Mrs. Leibowitz?\nOh, Frankie. You don't know bowl? For the soup, darlink. You don' have a bowl? So get cups for the soup. I mix pea soup and lentil soup. No ham. Irish like the ham. No ham, Frankie. Drink, missus. Drink you soup.\nShe spoons the soup into my mother's mouth, wipes the dribble from her chin. Malachy and I sit on the floor drinking from mugs. We spoon the soup into the twins' mouths. It is lovely and hot and tasty. My mother never makes soup like this and I wonder if there's any chance Mrs.\nLeibowitz could ever be my mother. Freddie could be me and have my mother and my father, too, and he could have Malachy and the twins for brothers. He can't have Margaret anymore because she's like the dog in the street that was taken away. I don't know why she was taken away. My mother said she died in her pram and that must be like getting hit by a car because they take you away.\nI wish little Margaret could be here for the soup. I could give it to her with a spoon the way Mrs. Leibowitz is giving it to my mother and she'd gurgle and laugh the way she did with Dad. She wouldn't cry anymore and my mother wouldn't be in the bed day and night and Dad would be telling me Cuchulain stories and I wouldn't want Mrs. Leibowitz to be my mother anymore. Mrs. Leibowitz is nice but I'd rather have my father telling me Cuchulain stories and Margaret chirping and Mam laughing when Dad dances with two left feet.\nMinnie MacAdorey comes in to help. Mother o' God, Mrs. Leibowitz, these twins smell to the high heavens.\nI don't know about Mother o' God, Minnie, but these twins need a wash. They need clean diapers. Frankie, where are the clean diapers?\nI don't know.\nMinnie says, They're just wearing rags for diapers. I'll get some of Maisie's. Frankie, you take off those rags and throw them out.\nMalachy removes Oliver's rag and I struggle with Eugene. The safety pin is stuck and when he wriggles it comes loose, sticks him in the hip, and starts him screaming for Mam. But Minnie is back with a towel and soap and hot water. I help her wash away the caked shit and she lets me shake talcum powder on the twins' raw sore skin. She says they're good little boys and she has a big surprise for them. She goes down the hall and brings back a pot of mashed potatoes for all of us. There is plenty of salt and butter in the potatoes and I wonder if there's any chance Minnie could be my mother so that I could eat like this all the time. If I could have Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie for mothers at the same time I'd have no end of soup and mashed potatoes.\nMinnie and Mrs. Leibowitz sit at the table. Mrs. Leibowitz says something has to be done. These children are running wild and where is the father? I hear Minnie whisper he's out for the drink. Mrs. Leibowitz says terrible, terrible, the way the Irish drink. Minnie says her Dan doesn't drink. Never touches the stuff and Dan told her that when the baby died that poor man, Malachy McCourt, went mad all over Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue, that he was thrown out of all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station, that the cops would have thrown him in jail if it was anything else but the death of that lovely little baby.\nHere he has four lovely little boys, says Minnie, but it's no comfort to him. That little girl brought out something in him. You know he didn't even drink after she was born and that was a miracle.\nMrs. Leibowitz wants to know where Mam's cousins are, the big women with the quiet husbands. Minnie will find them and tell them the children are neglected, running wild, sore arses and everything.\nTwo days later Dad returns from his cigarette hunt. It's the middle of the night but he gets Malachy and me out of the bed. He has the smell of the drink on him. He has us stand at attention in the kitchen. We are soldiers. He tells us we must promise to die for Ireland.\nWe will, Dad, we will.\nAll together we sing Kevin Barry,\nOn Mountjoy one Monday morning,\nHigh upon the gallows tree,\nKevin Barry gave his young life\nFor the cause of liberty.\nJust a lad of eighteen summers\nSure there's no one can deny\nAs he marched to death that morning\nHow he held his head on high.\nThere's a knock at the door, Mr. MacAdorey. Och, Malachy, for God's sake, it's three in the morning. You have the whole house woke with the singing.\nOch, Dan, I'm only teaching the boys to die for Ireland.\nYou can teach them to die for Ireland in the daytime, Malachy. 'Tis urgent, Dan, 'tis urgent.\nI know, Malachy, but they're only children. Babies. You go to bed\nnow like a dacent man.\nBed, Dan! What am I to do in bed? Her little face is there day and\nnight, her curly black hair and her lovely blue eyes. Oh, Jesus, Dan, what will I do? Was it the hunger that killed her, Dan?\nOf course not. Your missus was nursing her. God took her. He has his reasons.\nOne more song, Dan, before we go to bed. Good night, Malachy.\nCome on, boys. Sing.\nBecause he loved the motherland, Because he loved the green\nHe goes to meet a martyr's fate With proud and joyous mien;\nTrue to the last, oh! true to the last He treads the upward way;\nYoung Roddy McCorley goes to die\nOn the bridge at Toome today.\nYou'll die for Ireland, won't you, boys?\nWe will, Dad.\nAnd we'll all meet your little sister in heaven, won't we, boys? We will, Dad.\nMy brother is standing with his face pressed against a leg of the\ntable and he's asleep. Dad lifts him, staggers across the room, places him in the bed by my mother. I climb into bed and my father, still in his clothes, lies beside me. I'm hoping he'll put his arms around me but he goes on singing about Roddy McCorley and talking to Margaret, Oh, my little curly-haired, blue-eyed love, I would dress you in silks and take you to Lough Neagh, till day is at the window and I fall asleep.\nThat night Cuchulain comes to me. There's a big green bird on his shoulder that keeps singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley and I don't like that bird because there's blood dripping from his mouth when he sings. In one hand Cuchulain carries the gae bolga, the spear that is so mighty only he can throw it. In the other hand he carries a banana, which he keeps offering to the bird, who just squawks and spits blood at\nhim. You'd wonder why Cuchulain puts up with a bird like that. If the twins ever spat blood at me when I offered them a banana I think I'd hit them on the head with it.\nIn the morning my father is at the kitchen table and I tell him my dream. He says there were no bananas in Ireland in the old times and even if there were Cuchulain would never offer one to that bird because that was the one that came over from England for the summer and perched on his shoulder when he was dying and propped up against a stone and when the men of Erin which is Ireland wanted to kill him they were afraid till they saw the bird drinking Cuchulain's blood and then they knew it was safe to attack him, the dirty bloody cowards. So you have to be wary of birds, Francis, birds and Englishmen.\nMost of the day Mam lies in bed with her face to the wall. If she drinks tea or eats anything she throws up in the bucket under the bed and I have to empty it and rinse it in the lavatory down the hall. Mrs. Leibowitz brings her soup and funny bread that is twisted. Mam tries to slice it but Mrs. Leibowitz laughs and tells her just pull. Malachy calls it pull bread but Mrs. Leibowitz says, No, it's challah, and teaches us how to say it. She shakes her head. Oy, you Irish. You'll live forever but you'll never say challah like a Chew.\nMinnie MacAdorey brings potatoes and cabbage and sometimes a piece of meat. Och, times are hard, Angela, but that lovely man, Mr. Roosevelt, will find a job for everyone and your husband will have work. Poor man, it's not his fault there's a Depression. He looks for work day and night. My Dan is lucky, four years with the city and he don't drink. He grew up in Toome with your husband. Some drink. Some don't. Curse of the Irish. Now eat, Angela. Build yourself up after your loss.\nMr. MacAdorey tells Dad there's work with the WPA and when he gets the work there's money for food and Mam leaves the bed to clean the twins and to feed us. When Dad comes home with the drink smell there's no money and Mam screams at him till the twins cry, and Malachy and I run out to the playground. On those nights Mam crawls back into bed and Dad sings the sad songs about Ireland. Why doesn't he hold her and help her sleep the way he did with my little sister who died? Why doesn't he sing a Margaret song or a song that will dry Mam's tears? He still gets Malachy and me out of bed to stand in our shirts promising to die for Ireland. One night he wanted to make the twins promise to die for Ireland but they can't even talk and Mam screamed at him, You mad oul' bastard, can't you leave the children alone?\nHe'll give us a nickel for ice cream if we promise to die for Ireland and we promise but we never get the nickel.\nWe get soup from Mrs. Leibowitz and mashed potatoes from Minnie MacAdorey and they show us how to take care of the twins, how to wash their bottoms and how to wash diaper rags after they get them all shitty. Mrs. Leibowitz calls them diapers and Minnie calls them nappies but it doesn't matter what they call them because the twins get them shitty anyway. If Mam stays in the bed and Dad goes out looking for a job we can do what we like all day. We can put the twins in the small swings in the park and swing them till they get hungry and cry. The Italian man calls to me from across the street, Hey, Frankie, c'mere. Watch out crossing da street. Dem twins hungry again? He gives us bits of cheese and ham and bananas but I can't eat bananas anymore after the way the bird spat blood at Cuchulain.\nThe man says his name is Mr. Dimino and that's his wife, Angela, behind the counter. I tell him that's my mother's name. No kiddin', kid. Your mother is Angela? I didn't know the Irish had any Angelas. Hey, Angela, his mother's name is Angela. She smiles. She says, Thatsa nice.\nMr. Dimino asks me about Mam and Dad and who cooks for us. I tell him we get food from Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. I tell him all about the diapers and the nappies and how they get shitty anyway and he laughs. Angela, you listenin' to this? Thank God you're Italian, Angela. He says, Kid, I gotta talk to Mrs. Leibowitz. Ya gotta have relations can take care of you. Ya see Minnie MacAdorey, tell her come in see me. You kids runnin' wild.\nTwo big women are at the door. They say, Who are you? I'm Frank. Frank! How old are you?\nI'm four going on five.\nYou're not very big for your age, are you?\nI don't know.\nIs your mother here?\nShe's in the bed.\nWhat is she doing in the bed on a fine day in the middle of the\nday?\nShe's sleeping. Well, we'll come in. We have to talk to your\nmother.\nThey brush past me into the room. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, the smell\nof this place. And who are these children?\nMalachy runs smiling to the big women. When he smiles you can see\nhow white and straight and pretty his teeth are and you can see the shiny blue of his eyes, the pink of his cheeks. All that makes the big women smile and I wonder why they didn't smile when they talked to me.\nMalachy says, I'm Malachy and this is Oliver and this is Eugene, they're twins, and that's Frankie over there.\nThe big woman with the brown hair says, Well, you're not a bit shy, are you? I'm your mother's cousin, Philomena, and this is your mother's cousin, Delia. I'm Mrs. Flynn and she's Mrs. Fortune and that's what you call us.\nGood God, says Philomena. Those twins are naked. Don't you have clothes for them?\nMalachy says, They're all shitty.\nDelia barks. See. That's what happens. A mouth like a sewer, and no wonder with a father from the North. Don't use that word. That's a bad word, a curse word. You could go to hell using a word like that.\nWhat's hell? says Malachy. You'll know soon enough, says Delia.\nThe big women sit at the table with Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. Philomena says it's terrible what happened to Angela's little baby. They heard all about it and you'd wonder, wouldn't you, what they did with the little body. You might wonder and I might wonder but Tommy Flynn didn't wonder. Tommy said that Malachy from the North got money for that baby. Money? says Mrs. Leibowitz. That's right, says Philomena. Money. They take bodies any age and do experiments on them and there's not much left to give back nor would you want back bits of baby when they can't be buried in consecrated ground in that condition.\nThat's terrible, says Mrs. Leibowitz. A father or mother would never give the baby for something like that.\nThey would, says Delia, when they have the craving for the drink. They'd give their own mothers when they have the craving so what's a baby that's dead and gone in the first place?\nMrs. Leibowitz shakes her head and rocks in her chair. Oy, she says, oy, oy, oy. The poor baby. The poor mother. I thank God my husband don'have no what you call it? Craving? Right, craving. It's the Irish have the craving.\nNot my husband, says Philomena. I'd break his face if he came home with the craving. Of course, Delia's Jimmy has the craving. Every Friday night you see him slipping into the saloon.\nYou needn't start insulting my Jimmy, says Delia. He works. He brings home his wages.\nYou'd want to keep an eye on him, says Philomena. The craving could get the better of him and you'd have another Malachy from the North on your hands.\nMind your own bloody business, says Delia. At least Jimmy is Irish, not born in Brooklyn like your Tommy.\nAnd Philomena has no answer for that.\nMinnie is holding her baby and the big women say she's a lovely baby, clean, not like this pack of Angela's running around this place. Philomena says she doesn't know where Angela got her dirty habits because Angela's mother was spotless, so clean you could eat your dinner off her floor.\nI wonder why you'd want to eat your dinner off the floor when you had a table and a chair.\nDelia says something has to be done about Angela and these children for they are a disgrace, so they are, enough to make you ashamed to be related. A letter has to be written to Angela's mother. Philomena will write it because a teacher in Limerick told her once she had a fine fist. Delia has to tell Mrs. Leibowitz that a fine fist means good handwriting.\nMrs. Leibowitz goes down the hall to borrow her husband's fountain pen, paper and an envelope. The four women sit at the table and make up a letter to send to my mother's mother: Dear Aunt Margaret, I take pen in hand to write you this letter and hope this finds you as it leaves us in the best of health. My husband Tommy is in fine form working away and Delia's husband Jimmy is in fine form working away and we hope this finds you in fine form. I am very sorry to tell you that Angela is not in fine form as the baby died, the little girl that was called Margaret after yourself, and Angela has not been the same since lying in the bed with her face to the wall. To make matters worser we think she's expecting again and that's too much altogether. The minute she losses one child there is another one on the way. We don't know how she does it. She's married four years, five children and another on the way. That shows you what can happen when you marry someone from the North for they have no control over themselves up there a bunch of Protestands that they are. He goes out for work every day but we know he spends all his time in the saloons and gets a few dollars for sweeping floors and lifting barrels and spends the money right back on the drink. It's terrible, Aunt Margaret, and we all think Angela and the children would be better off in her native land. We don't have the money to buy the tickets ourselves for times is hard but you might be able to see your way. Hopping this finds you in fine form as it leaves us thank God and His Blessed Mother.\nI remain your loving neice\nPhilomena Flynn (what was MacNamara) and last but not least your neice Delia Fortune (what was MacNamara, too, ha ha ha)\nGrandma Sheehan sent money to Philomena and Delia. They bought the tickets, found a steamer trunk at the St. Vincent de Paul Society, hired a van to take us to the pier in Manhattan, put us on the ship, said Good- bye and good riddance, and went away.\nThe ship pulled away from the dock. Mam said, That's the Statue of Liberty and that's Ellis Island where all the immigrants came in. Then she leaned over the side and vomited and the wind from the Atlantic blew it all over us and other happy people admiring the view. Passengers cursed and ran, seagulls came from all over the harbor and Mam hung limp and pale on the ship's rail.\nII\nIn a week we arrived at Moville, County Donegal, where we took a bus to Belfast and from there another bus to Toome in County Antrim. We left the trunk in a shop and set out to walk the two miles up the road to Grandpa McCourt's house. It was dark on the road, the dawn barely stirring on the hills beyond.\nDad carried the twins in his arms and they took turns crying with the hunger. Mam stopped every few minutes to sit and rest on the stone wall along the road. We sat with her and watched the sky turn red and then blue. Birds started to chirp and sing in the trees and as the dawn came up we saw strange creatures in the fields, standing, looking at us. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?\nCows, son.\nWhat are cows, Dad?\nCows are cows, son.\nWe walked farther along the brightening road and there were other\ncreatures in the fields, white furry creatures. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?\nSheep, son.\nWhat are sheep, Dad?\nMy father barked at him, Is there any end to your questions? Sheep are sheep, cows are cows, and that over there is a goat. A goat is a goat. The goat gives milk, the sheep gives wool, the cow gives everything. What else in God's name do you want to know?\nAnd Malachy yelped with fright because Dad never talked like that, never spoke sharply to us. He might get us up in the middle of the night and make us promise to die for Ireland but he never barked like this. Malachy ran to Mam and she said, There, there, love, don't cry. Your father is just worn out carrying the twins and 'tis hard answering all those questions when you're carting twins through the world.\nDad set the twins on the road and held out his arms to Malachy. Now the twins started to cry and Malachy clung to Mam, sobbing. The cows mooed, the sheep maaed, the goat ehehed, the birds twittered in the trees, and the beep beep of a motor car cut through everything. A man called from the motor car, Good Lord, what are you people doing on this road at this hour of an Easter Sunday morning?\nDad said, Good morning, Father.\nFather? I said. Dad, is that your father?\nMam said, Don't ask him any questions.\nDad said, No, no, this is a priest.\nMalachy said, What's a-? but Mam put her hand over his mouth. The priest had white hair and a white collar. He said, Where are\nyou going?\nDad said, Up the road to McCourts of Moneyglass, and the priest\ntook us in his motor car. He said he knew the McCourts, a fine family, good Catholics, some daily communicants, and he hoped he'd see us all at Mass, especially the little Yankees who didn't know what a priest was, God help us.\nAt the house my mother reaches for the gate latch. Dad says, No, no, not that way. Not the front gate. They use the front door only for visits from the priest or funerals.\nWe make our way around the house to the kitchen door. Dad pushes in the door and there's Grandpa McCourt drinking tea from a big mug and Grandma McCourt frying something.\nOch, says Grandpa, you're here.\nOch, we are, says Dad. He points to my mother. This is Angela, he says. Grandpa says, Och, you must be worn out, Angela. Grandma says nothing, she turns back to the frying pan. Grandpa leads us through the kitchen to a large room with a long table and chairs. He says, Sit down and have some tea. Would you like boxty?\nMalachy says, What's boxty?\nDad laughs. Pancakes, son. Pancakes made with potatoes.\nGrandpa says, We have eggs. It's Easter Sunday and you can have all\nthe eggs you can hold.\nWe have tea and boxty and boiled eggs and we all fall asleep. I\nwake up in a bed with Malachy and the twins. My parents are in another bed over by the window. Where am I? It's getting dark. This is not the ship. Mam snores hink, Dad snores honk. I get up and poke at Dad. I have to pee. He says, Use the chamber pot.\nWhat?\nUnder the bed, son. The chamber pot. It has roses on it and maidens cavorting in the glen. Pee in that, son.\nI want to ask him what he's talking about for even if I'm bursting I feel strange peeing into a pot with roses and maidens cavorting, whatever they are. We had nothing like this in Classon Avenue where Mrs. Leibowitz sang in the lavatory while we clutched ourselves in the hall.\nNow Malachy has to use the chamber pot but he wants to sit on it. Dad says, No, you can't do that, son. You have to go outside. When he says that I have to go, too, to sit. He leads us downstairs and through the big room where Grandpa is sitting reading by the fire and Grandma is dozing in her chair. It's dark outside, though the moon is bright enough for us to see where we're going. Dad opens the door of a little house that has a seat with a hole in it. He shows Malachy and me how to sit on the hole and how to wipe ourselves with squares of newspaper stuck on a nail. Then he tells us wait while he goes inside, closes the door and grunts. The moon is so bright I can look down the field and see the things called cows and sheep and I wonder why they don't go home.\nIn the house there are other people in the room with my grandparents. Dad says, These are your aunts: Emily, Nora, Maggie, Vera. Your aunt Eva is in Ballymena with children like you. My aunts are not like Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey, they nod their heads but they don't hug us or smile. Mam comes into the room with the twins and when\nDad tells his sisters, This is Angela and these are the twins, they just nod again.\nGrandma goes to the kitchen and soon we have bread and sausages and tea. The only one who speaks at the table is Malachy. He points his spoon at the aunts and asks their names again. When Mam tells him eat his sausage and be quiet his eyes fill with tears and Aunt Nora reaches over to comfort him. She says, There, there, and I wonder why everyone says there there when Malachy cries. I wonder what there there means.\nIt's quiet at the table till Dad says, Things are terrible in America. Grandma says, Och, aye. I read it in the paper. But they say Mr. Roosevelt is a good man and if you stayed you might have work by now.\nDad shakes his head and Grandma says, I don't know what you're going to do, Malachy. Things are worse here than they are in America. No work here and, God knows, we don't have room in this house for six more people.\nDad says, I thought I might get work on some of the farms. We could get a small place.\nWhere would you stay in the meantime? says Grandma. And how would you support yourself and your family?\nOch, I could go on the dole, I suppose.\nYou can't get off a ship from America and go on the dole, says Grandpa. They make you wait a while and what would you do while you're waiting?\nDad says nothing and Mam looks straight ahead at the wall.\nYou'd be better off in the Free State, says Grandma. Dublin is big and surely there's work there or in the farms around.\nYou're entitled to money from the IRA, too, says Grandpa. You did your bit and they've been handing out money to men all over the Free State. You could go to Dublin and ask for help. We can loan you the bus fare to Dublin. The twins can sit on your lap and you won't have to pay for them.\nDad says, Och, aye, and Mam stares at the wall with tears in her eyes.\nAfter we ate we went back to bed and next morning, all the grown- ups sat around looking sad. Soon a man came in a motor car and took us back down the road to the shop which had our trunk. They lifted the trunk up on the roof of a bus and we got into the bus. Dad said we were going to Dublin. Malachy said, What's Dublin? but no one answered him. Dad held Eugene on his lap and Mam held Oliver. Dad looked out at the fields and told me this is where Cuchulain liked to go for a walk. I asked him where Cuchulain hit the ball into the dog's mouth and he said a few miles away.\nMalachy said, Look, look, and we looked. It was a great silvery sheet of water and Dad said it was Lough Neagh, the largest lake in Ireland, the lake where Cuchulain used to swim after his great battles. Cuchulain would get so hot that when he jumped into Lough Neagh it boiled over and warmed the surrounding countryside for days. Some day we'd all come back and go swimming like Cuchulain himself. We'd fish for eels and fry them in a pan not like Cuchulain, who would pluck them from the lough and swallow them, wriggling, because there's great power in an eel.\nIs that right, Dad?\n'Tis.\nMam didn't look out the window at Lough Neagh. Her cheek rested on\ntop of Oliver's head and she stared at the floor of the bus.\nSoon the bus is rolling into a place where there are big houses, motor cars, horses pulling carts, people on bicycles and hundreds walking. Malachy is excited. Dad, Dad, where's the playground, the swings? I want to see Freddie Leibowitz.\nOch, son, you're in Dublin now, far from Classon Avenue. You're in Ireland, a long way from New York.\nWhen the bus stops the trunk is lifted down and set on the floor of the bus station. Dad tells Mam she can sit on a bench in the station while he goes to see the IRA man in a place called Terenure. He says there are lavatories in the station for the boys, he won't be long, he'll have money when he returns and we'll all have food. He tells me go with him and Mam says, No, I need him to help. But when Dad says, I'll need help carrying all that money, she laughs and says, All right, go with your Pop.\nYour Pop. That means she's in a good mood. If she says your father it means she's in a bad mood.\nDad holds my hand as I trot along beside him. He's a fast walker, it's a long way to Terenure and I'm hoping he'll stop and carry me the way he did with the twins in Toome. But he lopes along and says nothing except to ask people where Terenure is. In awhile he says we're in Terenure and now we have to find Mr. Charles Heggarty of the IRA. A man with a pink patch on his eye tells us we're on the right street, Charlie Heggarty lives at number fourteen, God blast him. The man tells Dad, I can see you're a man that did his bit. Dad says, Och, I did my bit, and the man says, I did me bit, too, and what did it get me but one eye less and a pension that wouldn't feed a canary.\nBut Ireland is free, says Dad, and that's a grand thing.\nFree, my arse, the man says. I think we were better off under the English. Good luck to you anyway, mister, for I think I know what you're here for.\nA woman opens the door at number fourteen. I'm afraid, she says, that Mr. Heggarty is busy. Dad tells her he just walked all the way from the middle of Dublin with his small son, that he left wife and three children waiting for him at the bus place, and if Mr. Heggarty is that busy then we'll wait for him on the doorstep.\nThe woman is back in a minute to say Mr. Heggarty has a little time to spare and would you come this way. Mr. Heggarty is sitting at a desk near a glowing fire. He says, What can I do for you? Dad stands before the desk and says, I have just returned from America with wife and four children. We have nothing. I fought with a Flying Column during the Troubles and I'm hoping you can help me now in the time of need.\nMr. Heggarty takes Dad's name and turns the pages of a big book on his desk. He shakes his head, No, no record of your service here. Dad makes a long speech. He tells Mr. Heggarty how he fought, where, when, how he had to be smuggled out of Ireland because of the price on his head, how he was raising his sons to love Ireland.\nMr. Heggarty says he's sorry but he can't be handing out money to every man who wanders in claiming he did his bit. Dad says to me, Remember this, Francis. This is the new Ireland. Little men in little chairs with little bits of paper. This is the Ireland men died for. Mr. Heggarty says he'll look into Dad's claim and he'll be sure to let him know what turns up. He'll let us have money to take the bus back into the city. Dad looks at the coins in Mr. Heggarty's hand and says, You could add to that and make the price of a pint.\nOh, it's the drink you want, is it?\nOne pint is hardly drink.\nYou'd walk the miles back and make the boy walk because you want a\npint, wouldn't you?\nWalking never killed anyone.\nI want you to leave this house, says Mr. Heggarty, or I'll call a\nguard, and you can be sure you'll never hear from me again. We're not handing out money to support the Guinness family.\nNight falls along the streets of Dublin. Children laugh and play under streetlights, mothers call from doorways, smells of cooking come at us all the way, through windows we see people around tables, eating. I'm tired and hungry and I want Dad to carry me but I know there's no use asking him now the way his face is tight and set. I let him hold my hand and I run to keep up with him till we reach the bus place where Mam is waiting with my brothers.\nThey're all asleep on the bench, my mother and three brothers. When Dad tells Mam there's no money she shakes her head and sobs, Oh, Jesus, what are we going to do? A man in a blue uniform comes over and asks her, What's up, missus? Dad tells him we're stranded there at the bus station, we have no money and no place to stay and the children are hungry. The man says he's going off duty now, he'll take us to the police barracks where he has to report anyway, and they'll see what can be done.\nThe man in uniform tells us we can call him guard. That's what you call policemen in Ireland. He asks us what you call policemen in America and Malachy says, cop. The guard pats him on the head and tells him he's a clever little Yankee.\nAt the police barracks the sergeant tells us we can spend the night. He's sorry but all he can offer is the floor. It's Thursday and the cells are filled with men who drank their dole money and wouldn't leave the pubs.\nThe guards give us hot sweet tea and thick slices of bread slathered with butter and jam and we're so happy we run around the barracks, playing. The guards say we're a great bunch of little Yanks and they'd like to take us home but I say, No, Malachy says, No, the twins say, No, No, and all the guards laugh. Men in cells reach out and pat our heads, they smell like Dad when he comes home singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley going to die. The men say, Jasus, will ye listen to them. They sound like bloody fillum stars. Did yez fall outa the sky or what? Women in cells at the other end tell Malachy he's gorgeous and the twins are dotes. One woman talks to me. C'mere, love, would you like a sweet? I nod, and she says, All right, put your hand out. She takes something sticky from her mouth and puts it on my hand. There you are now, she says, a nice bit of butterscotch. Put that in your mouth. I don't want to put it in my mouth because it's sticky and wet from her mouth but I don't know what you're supposed to do when a woman in a cell offers you sticky butterscotch and I'm about to put it in my mouth when a guard comes, takes the butterscotch and throws it back at the woman. You drunken hoor, he says, leave the child alone, and all the women laugh.\nThe sergeant gives my mother a blanket and she sleeps stretched out on a bench. The rest of us lie on the floor. Dad sits with his back to the wall, his eyes open under the peak of his cap, and he smokes when the guards give him cigarettes. The guard who threw the butterscotch at the woman says he's from Ballymena in the north and he talks with Dad about people they know there and in other places like Cushendall and Toome. The\nguard says he'll have a pension some day and he'll live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away. Eels, he says, eels galore. Jasus, I love a fried eel. I ask Dad, Is this Cuchulain? and the guard laughs till his face turns red. Ah, Mother o' God, did yez hear this? The lad wants to know if I'm Cuchulain. A little Yank and he knows all about Cuchulain.\nDad says, No, he's not Cuchulain but he's a fine man who will live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away.\n****\nDad is shaking me. Up, Francis, up. It is noisy in the barracks. A boy mopping the floor is singing, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this, Could it be true, someone like you Could love me, love me?\nI tell him that's my mother's song and he's to stop singing it but he just puffs on his cigarette and walks away and I wonder why people have to sing other people's songs. Men and women coming out of the cells are yawning and grunting. The woman who offered me the butterscotch stops and says, I had a drop taken, child. I'm sorry I made a fool of you, but the guard from Ballymena tells her, Move on, you oul' hoor, before I lock you up again.\nOh, lock me up, she says. In, out. What does it matter, you blue arsed bastard.\nMam is sitting up on the bench, the blanket wrapped around her. A woman with gray hair brings her a mug of tea and tells her, Sure, I'm the sergeant's wife and he said you might need help. Would you like a nice soft-boiled egg, missus?\nMam shakes her head, no.\nAh, now, missus, surely you should have a nice egg in your condition.\nBut Mam shakes her head and I wonder how she can say no to a soft- boiled egg when there's nothing in the world like it.\nAll right, ma'am, says the sergeant's wife, a bit of toast, then, and something for the children and your poor husband.\nShe goes back to another room and soon there's tea and bread. Dad drinks his tea but gives us his bread and Mam says, Will you eat your bread, for God's sake. You won't be much use to us falling down with the hunger. He shakes his head and asks the sergeant's wife is there any chance of a cigarette. She brings him the cigarette and tells Mam the guards in the barracks have taken up a collection to pay our train fares to Limerick. There will be a motor car to pick up our trunk and leave us at Kingsbridge Railway Station and, You'll be in Limerick in three or four hours.\nMam puts up her arms and hugs the sergeant's wife. God bless you and your husband and all the guards, Mam says. I don't know what we'd do without you. God knows 'tis a lovely thing to be back among our own.\n'Tis the least we could do, says the sergeant's wife. These are lovely children you have and I'm from Cork meself and I know what 'tis to be in Dublin without two pennies to rub together.\nDad sits at the other end of the bench, smoking his cigarette, drinking his tea. He stays that way till the motor car comes to take us through the streets of Dublin. Dad asks the driver if he'd mind going by way of the G. P. O. and the driver says, Is it a stamp you want or what? No, says Dad. I hear they put up a new statue of Cuchulain to honor the men who died in 1916 and I'd like to show it to my son here who has a great admiration for Cuchulain.\nThe driver says he has no notion of who this Cuchulain was but he wouldn't mind stopping one bit. He might come in himself and see what the commotion is all about for he hasn't been in the G. P. O. since he was a boy and the English nearly wrecked it with their big guns firing up from the Liffey River. He says you'll see the bullet holes all over the front and they should be left there to remind the Irish of English perfidy. I ask the man what's perfidy and he says ask your father and I would but we're stopping outside a big building with columns and that's the G. P. O.\nMam stays in the motor car while we follow the driver into the G. P. O. There he is, he says, there's your man Cuchulain.\nAnd I feel tears coming because I'm looking at him at last, Cuchulain, there on his pedestal in the G. P. O. He's golden and he has long hair, his head is hanging and there's a big bird perched on his shoulder.\nThe driver says, Now what in God's name is this all about? What's this fellow doin' with the long hair and the bird on his shoulder? And will you kindly tell me, mister, what this has to do with the men of 1916?\nDad says, Cuchulain fought to the end like the men of Easter Week. His enemies were afraid to go near him till they were sure he was dead and when the bird landed on him and drank his blood they knew.\nWell, says the driver, 'tis a sad day for the men of Ireland when they need a bird to tell them a man is dead. I think we better go now or we'll be missing that train to Limerick.\nThe sergeant's wife said she'd send a telegram to Grandma to meet us in Limerick and there she was on the platform, Grandma, with white hair, sour eyes, a black shawl, and no smile for my mother or any of us, even my brother, Malachy, who had the big smile and the sweet white teeth. Mam pointed to Dad. This is Malachy, she said, and Grandma nodded and looked away. She called two boys who were hanging around the railway station and paid them to carry the trunk. The boys had shaved heads, snotty noses, and no shoes and we followed them through the streets of Limerick. I asked Mam why they had no hair and she said their heads were shaved so that the lice would have no place to hide. Malachy said, What's a lice? and Mam said, Not lice. One of them is a louse. Grandma said, Will ye stop it! What kind o' talk is this? The boys whistled and laughed and trotted along as if they had shoes and Grandma told them, Stop that laughin' or 'tis droppin' an' breakin' that trunk ye'll be. They stopped the whistling and laughing and we followed them into a park with a tall pillar and a statue in the middle and grass so green it dazzled you.\nDad carried the twins, Mam carried a bag in one hand and held Malachy's hand with the other. When she stopped every few minutes to catch her breath, Grandma said, Are you still smokin' them fags? Them fags will be the death of you. There's enough consumption in Limerick without people smokin' fags on top of it an'\n'tis a rich man's foolishness.\nAlong the path through the park there were hundreds of flowers of different colors that excited the twins. They pointed and made squeaky noises and we laughed, everyone except Grandma, who pulled her shawl over her head. Dad stopped and put the twins down so that they could be closer to the flowers. He said, Flowers, and they ran back and forth, pointing, trying to say Flowers. One of the boys with the trunk said, God, are they Americans? and Mam said, They are. They were born in New York. All the\nboys were born in New York. The boy said to the other boy, God, they're Americans. They put the trunk down and stared at us and we stared back at them till Grandma said, Are ye goin' to stand here all day lookin' at flowers an' gawkin' at each other? And we all moved on again, out of the park, down a narrow lane and into another lane to Grandma's house.\nThere is a row of small houses on each side of the lane and Grandma lives in one of the small houses. Her kitchen has a shiny polished black iron range with a fire glowing in the grate. There is a table along the wall under the window and a press opposite with cups and saucers and vases. This press is always locked and she keeps the key in her purse because you're not supposed to use anything in there unless someone dies or returns from foreign parts or there's a visit by a priest.\nThere is a picture on the wall by the range of a man with long brown hair and sad eyes. He is pointing to his chest where there is a big heart with flames coming out of it. Mam tells us, That's the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and I want to know why the man's heart is on fire and why doesn't He throw water on it? Grandma says, Don't these children know anything about their religion? and Mam tells her it's different in America. Grandma says the Sacred Heart is everywhere and there's no excuse for that kind of ignorance.\nUnder the picture of the man with the burning heart there is a shelf with a red glass holding a flickering candle and next to it a small statue. Mam tells us, That's the Baby Jesus, the Infant of Prague, and if ye ever need anything pray to Him.\nMalachy says, Mam, could I tell Him I'm hungry, and Mam puts her finger to her lips.\nGrandma grumbles around the kitchen making tea and telling Mam to cut the loaf of bread and don't make the cuts too thick. Mam sits by the table with her breath coming hard and says she'll cut the bread in a minute. Dad takes the knife and starts slicing the bread and you can see Grandma doesn't like that. She frowns at him but says nothing even though he makes thick slices.\nThere aren't enough chairs for everyone so I sit on the stairs with my brothers to have bread and tea. Dad and Mam sit at the table and Grandma sits under the Sacred Heart with her mug of tea. She says, I don't know under God what I'm goin' to do with ye. There is no room in this house. There isn't room for even one of ye.\nMalachy says, Ye, ye, and starts to giggle and I say, Ye, ye, and the twins say, Ye, ye, and we're laughing so hard we can hardly eat our bread.\nGrandma glares at us. What are ye laughin' at? There's nothin' to laugh at in this house. Ye better behave yeerselves before I go over to\nye.\nShe won't stop saying Ye, and now Malachy is helpless with\nlaughter, spewing out his bread and tea, his face turning red.\nDad says, Malachy and the rest of you, stop it. But Malachy can't, he goes on laughing till Dad says, Come over here. He rolls up Malachy's\nsleeve and raises his hand to slap his arm.\nAre you going to behave yourself?\nMalachy's eyes fill with tears and he nods, I will, because Dad\nnever raised his hand like that before. Dad says, Be a good boy and go sit with your brothers, and he pulls down the sleeve and pats Malachy on the head.\nThat night Mam's sister, Aunt Aggie, came home from her job in the clothing factory. She was big like the MacNamara sisters, and she had flaming red hair. She wheeled a large bicycle into the little room behind the kitchen and came out to her supper. She was living in Grandma's because she had a fight with her husband, Pa Keating, who told her, when he had drink taken, You're a great fat cow, go home to your mother. That's what Grandma told Mam and that's why there was no room for us in Grandma's house. She had herself, Aunt Aggie, and her son Pat, who was my uncle and who was out selling newspapers.\nAunt Aggie complained when Grandma told her Mam would have to sleep with her that night. Grandma said, Oh, will you shut your gob. 'Tis only for one night an' that won't kill you an' if you don't like it you can go back to your husband where you belong anyway instead of runnin' home to me. Jesus, Mary an' Holy St. Joseph, look at this house- you an' Pat an' Angela and her clatther of Americans. Will I have any peace in the latter end of my life?\nShe spread coats and rags on the floor of the little back room and we slept there with the bicycle. Dad stayed on a chair in the kitchen, took us to the lavatory in the backyard when we needed it, and in the night hushed the twins when they cried from the cold.\nIn the morning, Aunt Aggie came for her bicycle telling us, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of my way?\nWhen she left, Malachy kept saying, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of the way, will ye? and I could hear Dad laughing out in the kitchen till Grandma came down the stairs and he had to tell Malachy be quiet.\nThat day Grandma and Mam went out and found a furnished room on Windmill Street where Aunt Aggie had a flat with her husband, Pa Keating. Grandma paid the rent, ten shillings for two weeks. She gave Mam money for food, loaned us a kettle, a pot, a frying pan, knives and spoons, jam jars to be used for mugs, a blanket and a pillow. She said that was all she could afford anymore, that Dad would have to get up off his arse, get a job, go on the dole, go for the charity at the St. Vincent de Paul Society or go on the relief.\nThe room had a fireplace where we could boil water for our tea or an egg in case we ever came into money. We had a table and three chairs and a bed, which Mam said was the biggest she had ever seen. We were glad of the bed that night, worn out after nights on floors in Dublin and in Grandma's. It didn't matter that there were six of us in the bed, we were together, away from grandmothers and guards, Malachy could say ye ye ye and we could laugh as much as we liked.\nDad and Mam lay at the head of the bed, Malachy and I at the bottom, the twins wherever they could find comfort. Malachy made us laugh again. Ye, ye, ye, he said, and oy oy oy, and then fell asleep. Mam made the little hink hink snore sound that told us she was sleeping. In the moonlight I could look up the length of the bed and see Dad still awake and when Oliver cried in his sleep Dad reached for him and held him. Whisht, he said. Whisht.\nThen Eugene sat up, screaming, tearing at himself. Ah, ah, Mommy, Mommy. Dad sat up. What? What's up, son? Eugene went on crying and when Dad leaped from the bed and turned on the gaslight we saw the fleas, leaping, jumping, fastened to our flesh. We slapped at them and slapped but they hopped from body to body, hopping, biting. We tore at the bites till they bled. We jumped from the bed, the twins crying, Mam moaning,\nOh, Jesus, will we have no rest! Dad poured water and salt into a jam jar and dabbed at our bites. The salt burned but he said we'd feel better\nsoon.\nMam sat by the fireplace with the twins on her lap. Dad pulled on\nhis trousers and dragged the mattress off the bed and out to the street. He filled the kettle and the pot with water, stood the mattress against the wall, pounded it with a shoe, told me to keep pouring water on the ground to drown the fleas dropping there. The Limerick moon was so bright I could see bits of it shimmering in the water and I wanted to scoop up moon bits but how could I with the fleas leaping on my legs. Dad kept pounding with the shoe and I had to run back through the house to the backyard tap for more water in the kettle and the pot. Mam said, Look at you. Your shoes are drenched and you'll catch your death and your father will surely get the pneumonia without a shoe to his foot.\nA man on a bicycle stopped and wanted to know why Dad was beating that mattress. Mother o' God, he said, I never heard such a cure for fleas. Do you know that if a man could jump like a flea one lep would take him halfway to the moon? The thing to do is this, when you go back inside with that mattress stick it on the bed upside down and that will confuse the little buggers. They won't know where they are and they'll be biting the mattress or each other, which is the best cure of all. After they bite the human being they have the frenzy, you know, for there are other fleas around them that also bit the human being and the smell of the blood is too much for them and they go out of their minds. They're a right bloody torment an' I should know for didn't I grow up in Limerick, down in the Irishtown, an' the fleas there were so plentiful an' forward they'd sit on the toe of your boot an' discuss Ireland's woeful history with you. It is said there were no fleas in ancient Ireland, that they were brought in be the English to drive us out of our wits entirely, an'I wouldn't put it past the English. An'isn't it a very curious thing that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland an' the English brought in the fleas. For centuries Ireland was a lovely peaceful place, snakes gone, not a flea to be found. You could stroll the four green fields of Ireland without fear of snakes an' have a good night's sleep with no fleas to bother you. Them snakes were doin' no harm, they wouldn't bother you unless you cornered them an' they lived off other creatures that move under bushes an'such places, whereas the flea sucks the blood from you mornin' noon an' night for that's his nature an' he can't help himself. I hear for a fact that places that have snakes galore have no fleas. Arizona, for instance. You're forever hearing about the snakes of Arizona but when did you ever hear of fleas in Arizona? Good luck to you. I have to be careful standin' here for if one of them gets on my clothes I might as well invite his whole family home. They multiply faster than Hindus.\nDad said, You wouldn't by any chance have a cigarette, would you?\nA cigarette? Oh, sure, of course. Here you are. Aren't I nearly destroyed from the fags myself. The oul' hacking cough, you know. So powerful it nearly knocks me off the bicycle. I can feel that cough stirring in me solar plexus an' workin' its way up through me entrails till the next thing it takes off the top o' me head.\nHe struck a match on a box, lit a cigarette for himself and held out the match for Dad. Of course, he said, you're bound to have the cough when you live in Limerick because this is the capital city of the weak chest and the weak chest leads to the consumption. If all the people that has consumption in Limerick were to die this would be a ghost town,\nthough I don't have consumption meself. No, this cough was a present from the Germans. He paused, puffed on his cigarette, and struggled with a cough. Bejesus, excuse the language, but the fags'll get me in the end. Well, I'll leave you now to the mattress an' remember what I told you, confuse the little buggers.\nHe wobbled away on his bicycle, the cigarette dangling from his mouth, the cough racking his body. Dad said, Limerickmen talk too much. Come on, we'll put this mattress back and see if there's any sleep in this night.\nMam sat by the fireplace with the twins asleep on her lap, and Malachy lay curled up on the floor by her feet. She said, Who was that you were talking to? It sounded very like Pa Keating, Aggie's husband. I could tell by the cough. He got that cough in France in the war when he swallowed the gas.\nWe slept the rest of that night, and in the morning we saw where the fleas had feasted, our flesh pink with flea welts and bright with the blood of our scratches.\nMam made tea and fried bread, and once more Dad dabbed at our bites with the salty water. He hauled the mattress outside again to the backyard. On a cold day like this the fleas would surely freeze to death and we'd all have a good night's sleep.\nA few days later when we're settled into the room Dad is shaking me out of my dreams. Up, Francis, up. Put on your clothes and run over for your aunt Aggie. Your mother needs her. Hurry.\nMam is moaning in the bed, her face pure white. Dad has Malachy and the twins out of the bed and sitting on the floor by the dead fire. I run across the street and knock on Aunt Aggie's door till Uncle Pat Keating comes coughing and grumbling, What's up? What's up?\nMy mother is moaning in the bed. I think she's sick.\nNow Aunt Aggie comes grumbling. Ye are nothing but trouble since ye came from America.\nLeave him alone, Aggie, he's only a child that's doing what he's told.\nShe tells Uncle Pa go back to bed, that he has to go to work in the morning not like some from the North that she won't mention. He says, No, no, I'm coming. There's something wrong with Angela.\nDad tells me sit over there with my brothers. I don't know what's up with Mam because everyone is whispering and I can barely hear Aunt\nAggie\nPa is\nabout\nnever looks at him.\ntelling Uncle Pa the child is lost run for the ambulance and Uncle out the door, Aunt Aggie telling Mam you can say what you like Limerick but the ambulance is fast. She doesn't talk to my father,\nMalachy says, Dad, is Mammy sick?\nOch, she'll be all right, son. She has to see the doctor.\nI wonder what child is lost because we're all here, one two three\nfour of us, not a lost child anywhere and why can't they tell me what's wrong with my mother. Uncle Pa comes back and the ambulance is right behind him. A man comes in with a stretcher and after they carry Mam away there are blood spots on the floor by the bed. Malachy bit his tongue and there was blood and the dog on the street had blood and he died. I want to ask Dad to tell me if Mam will be gone forever like my sister Margaret but he's going with Mam and there's no use asking Aunt Aggie anything for fear she'd bite your head off. She wipes away the blood spots and tells us get back into bed and stay there till Dad comes home.\nIt's the middle of the night and the four of us are warm in the bed and we fall asleep till Dad comes home and tells us Mam is nice and comfortable in the hospital and she'll be home in no time.\nLater, Dad goes to the Labour Exchange for the dole. There is no hope of a laboring man with a North of Ireland accent getting a job in Limerick.\nWhen he returns, he tells Mam we'll be getting nineteen shillings a week. She says that's just enough for all of us to starve on. Nineteen shillings for six of us? That's less than four dollars in American money and how are we supposed to live on that? What are we to do when we have to pay rent in a fortnight? If the rent for this room is five shillings a week we'll have fourteen shillings for food and clothes and coal to boil the water for the tea.\nDad shakes his head, sips his tea from a jam jar, stares out the window and whistles \"The Boys of Wexford. \" Malachy and Oliver clap their hands and dance around the room and Dad doesn't know whether to whistle or smile because you can't do both and he can't help himself. He has to stop and smile and pat Oliver's head and then go back to the whistling. Mam smiles, too, but it's a very quick smile and when she looks into the ashes you can see the worry where the corners of her mouth turn down.\nNext day she tells Dad to mind the twins and takes Malachy and me with her to the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We stand in a queue with women wearing black shawls. They ask our names and smile when we talk. They say, Lord above, would you listen to the little Yankees, and they wonder why Mam in her American coat would be looking for charity since there's hardly enough for the poor people of Limerick without Yanks coming over and taking the bread out of their mouths.\nMam tells them a cousin gave her that coat in Brooklyn, that her husband has no work, that she has other children at home, twin boys. The women sniff and pull their shawls about them, they have their own troubles. Mam tells them she had to leave America because she couldn't stand it after her baby girl died. The women sniff again but now it's because Mam is crying. Some say they lost little ones, too, and there's nothing worse in the world, you could live as long as Methuselem's wife but you never get over it. No man can ever know what it is to be a mother that has lost a child, not if the man lived longer than two Methuselems.\nThey all have a good cry till a red-haired woman passes a little box around. The women pick something from the box between their fingers and stuff it up their noses. A young woman sneezes and the red-haired woman laughs. Ah, sure, Biddy, you're not able for that snuff. Come here, little Yankee boys, have a pinch. She plants the brown stuff in our nostrils and we sneeze so hard the women stop crying and laugh till they have to wipe their eyes with their shawls. Mam tells us, That's good for ye, 'twill clear yeer heads.\nThe young woman, Biddy, tells Mam we're two lovely boys. She points at Malachy. That little fella with the goldy ringlet, isn't he gorgeous? He could be a film star with Shirley Temple. And Malachy smiles and warms up the queue.\nThe woman with the snuff says to Mam, Missus, I don't want to be forward but I think you should be sitting down for we heard about your\nloss.\nAnother woman worries, Ah, no, they don't like that. Who don't like what?\nAh, sure, Nora Molloy, the Society don't like us sittin' on the steps. They want us to be standin' respectful against the wall.\nThey can kiss my arse, says Nora, the red-haired woman. Sit down there, missus, on that step an' I'll sit next to you an' if there's one word out of the St. Vincent de Paul Society I'll take the face off 'em, so I will. Do you smoke, missus?\nI do, says Mam, but I don't have them.\nNora takes a cigarette from a pocket in her apron, breaks it, and offers half to Mam.\nThe worried woman says, They don't like that either. They say every fag you smoke is taking food from the mouth of your child. Mr. Quinlivan inside is dead against it. He says if you have money for the fags you have money for food.\nQuinlivan can kiss my arse, too, the grinny oul' bastard. Is he going to begrudge us a puff of a fag, the only comfort we have in the world?\nA door opens at the end of the hall and a man appears. Are any of ye waiting for children's boots?\nWomen raise their hands, I am. I am.\nWell, the boots are all gone. Ye'll have to come back next month. But my Mikey needs boots for school.\nThey're all gone, I told you.\nBut 'tis freezin' abroad, Mr. Quinlivan.\nThe boots are all gone. Nothing I can do. What's this? Who's\nsmoking?\nNora waves her cigarette. I am, she says, and enjoying it down to\nthe last ash.\nEvery puff you take, he starts.\nI know, she says, I'm taking food out of the mouths of my children. You're insolent, woman. You'll get no charity here.\nIs that a fact? Well, Mr. Quinlivan, if I don't get it here I know\nwhere I will.\nWhat are you talking about?\nI'll go to the Quakers. They'll give me the charity.\nMr. Quinlivan steps toward Nora and points a finger. Do you know\nwhat we have here? We have a souper in our midst. We had the soupers in the Famine. The Protestants went round telling good Catholics that if they gave up their faith and turned Protestant they'd get more soup than their bellies could hold and, God help us, some Catholics took the soup, and were ever after known as soupers and lost their immortal souls doomed to the deepest part of hell. And you, woman, if you go to the Quakers you'll lose your immortal soul and the souls of your children.\nother\nThen, Mr. Quinlivan, you'll have to save us, won't you?\nHe stares at her and she stares back at him. His eyes wander to the\nwomen. One puts her hand to her mouth to smother a laugh.\nWhat are you tittering about? he barks.\nOh, nothing, Mr. Quinlivan. Honest to God.\nI'm telling ye once more, no boots. And he slams the door behind\nhim.\nOne by one the women are called into the room. When Nora comes out\nshe's smiling and waving a piece of paper. Boots, she says. Three pairs I'm gettin' for my children. Threaten the men in there with the Quakers and they'll give you the drawers off their arses.\nWhen Mam is called she brings Malachy and me in with her. We stand before a table where three men are sitting asking questions. Mr. Quinlivan starts to say something but the man in the middle says, Enough out of you, Quinlivan. If we left it up to you we'd have the poor people of Limerick jumping into the arms of the Protestants.\nHe turns to Mam, he wants to know where she got that fine red coat. She tells him what she told the women outside and when she comes to the death of Margaret she shakes and sobs. She tells the men she's very sorry for crying like that but it was only a few months ago and she's not over it yet, not even knowing where her baby was buried if she was buried at all, not knowing even if she was baptized itself because she was so weak from having the four boys she didn't have the energy to be going to the church for the baptism and it's a heart scald to think Margaret might be in Limbo forever with no hope of her ever seeing the rest of us whether we're in heaven, hell, or Purgatory itself.\nMr. Quinlivan brings her his chair. Ah, now, missus. Ah, now. Sit down, will you. Ah, now.\nThe other men look at the table, the ceiling. The man in the middle says he's giving Mam a docket to get a week's groceries at McGrath's shop on Parnell Street. There will be tea, sugar, flour, milk, butter and a separate docket for a bag of coal from Sutton's coal yard on the Dock Road.\nThe third man says, Of course you won't be getting this every week, missus. We will be visiting your house to see if there's a real need. We have to do that, missus, so we can review your claim.\nMam wipes her face on the back of her sleeve and takes the docket. She tells the men, God bless you for your kindness. They nod and look at the table, the ceiling, the walls and tell her send in the next woman.\nThe women outside tell Mam, When you go to McGrath's, keep an eye on the oul' bitch for she'll cheat you on the weight. She'll put stuff on a paper on the scale with the paper hanging down on her side behind the counter where she thinks you can't see it. She'll pull on that paper so that you're lucky if you get half of what you're supposed to get. And she has pictures of the Virgin Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus all over the shop, and she's forever on her knees abroad in St. Joseph's chapel clackin' her rosary beads an' breathing like a virgin martyr, the oul' bitch.\nNora says, I'll go with you, missus. I'm on to the same Mrs. McGrath and I'll know if she's cheating you.\nShe leads the way to the shop in Parnell Street. The woman behind the counter is pleasant to Mam in her American coat till Mam shows the St. Vincent de Paul docket. The woman says, I don't know what you're doing here at this hour of the day. I never serve the charity cases before six in the evening. But this is your first time and I'll make an exception.\nShe says to Nora, Do you have a docket, too?\nNo. I'm a friend helping this poor family with their first docket from the St. Vincent de Paul.\nThe woman lays a sheet of newspaper on the scale and pours on flour from a large bag. When she finishes pouring, she says, There's a pound of flour.\nI don't think so, says Nora. That's a very small pound of flour. The woman flushes and glares, Are you accusin' me?\nAh, no, Mrs. McGrath, says Nora. I think there was a little accident there the way your hip was pressed against that paper and you didn't even know the paper was pulled down a bit. Oh, God, no. A woman like you that's forever on her knees before the Virgin Mary is an inspiration to us all and is that your money I see on the floor there?\nMrs. McGrath steps back quickly and the needle on the scale jumps and quivers. What money? she says, till she looks at Nora, and knows. Nora smiles. Must be a trick of the shadows, she says, and smiles at the scale. There was a mistake right enough for that shows barely half a pound of flour.\nThat scale gives me more trouble, says Mrs. McGrath.\nI'm sure it does, says Nora.\nBut my conscience is clear before God, says Mrs. McGrath.\nI'm sure it is, says Nora, and you're admired by one and all at the\nSt. Vincent de Paul Society and the Legion of Mary.\nI try to be a good Catholic.\nTry? God knows 'tis little trying you'd have for you're well known\nfor having a kind heart and I was wondering if you could spare a couple of sweets for the little boys here.\nWell, now, I'm not a millionaire, but here...\nGod bless you, Mrs. McGrath, and I know it's asking a lot but could you possibly lend me a couple of cigarettes?\nWell, now, they're not on the docket. I'm not here to supply luxuries.\nIf you could see your way, missus, I'd be sure to mention your kindness to the St. Vincent de Paul.\nAll right, all right, says Mrs. McGrath. Here. One time for the cigarettes and one time only.\nGod bless you, says Nora, and I'm sorry you had so much trouble with that scale.\nOn the way home we stopped in the People's Park and sat on a bench while Malachy and I sucked on our sweets and Mam and Nora smoked their cigarettes. The smoking brought on Nora's cough and she told Mam the fags would kill her in the end, that there was a touch of consumption in her family and no one lived to a ripe old age, though who would want to in Limerick, a place where you could look around and the first thing you noticed was a scarcity of gray hairs, all the gray hairs either in the graveyard or across the Atlantic working on railroads or sauntering around in police uniforms.\nYou're lucky, missus, that you saw a bit of the world. Oh, God, I'd give anything to see New York, people dancing up and down Broadway without a care. No, I had to go and fall for a boozer with the charm, Peter Molloy, a champion pint drinker that had me up the pole and up the aisle when I was barely seventeen. I was ignorant, missus. We grew up ignorant in Limerick, so we did, knowing feck all about anything and signs on, we're mothers before we're women. And there's nothing here but rain and oul' biddies saying the rosary. I'd give me teeth to get out, go to America or even England itself. The champion pint drinker is always on the dole and sometimes he even drinks that and drives me so demented I wind up in the lunatic asylum.\nShe drew on her cigarette and gagged, coughing till her body rocked back and forth, and in between the coughs she whimpered, Jesus, Jesus. When the cough died away she said she had to go home and take her medicine. She said, I'll see you next week, missus, at the St. Vincent de\nPaul. If you're stuck for anything send a message to me at Vize's Field. Ask anyone for the wife of Peter Molloy, champion pint drinker.\nEugene is sleeping under a coat on the bed. Dad sits by the fireplace with Oliver on his lap. I wonder why Dad is telling Oliver a Cuchulain story. He knows the Cuchulain stories are mine, but when I look at Oliver I don't mind. His cheeks are bright red, he's staring into the dead fire, and you can see he has no interest in Cuchulain. Mam puts her hand on his forehead. I think he has a fever, she says. I wish I had an onion and I'd boil it in milk and pepper. That's good for the fever. But even if I had what would I boil the milk on? We need coal for that fire.\nShe gives Dad the docket for the coal down the Dock Road. He takes me with him but it's dark and all the coal yards are closed.\nWhat are we going to do now, Dad?\nI don't know, son.\nAhead of us women in shawls and small children are picking up coal\nalong the road.\nThere, Dad, there's coal.\nOch, no, son. We won't pick coal off the road. We're not beggars. He tells Mam the coal yards are closed and we'll have to drink milk\nand eat bread tonight, but when I tell her about the women on the road she passes Eugene to him.\nIf you're too grand to pick coal off the road I'll put on my coat and go down the Dock Road.\nShe gets a bag and takes Malachy and me with her. Beyond the Dock Road there is something wide and dark with lights glinting in it. Mam says that's the River Shannon. She says that's what she missed most of all in America, the River Shannon. The Hudson was lovely but the Shannon sings. I can't hear the song but my mother does and that makes her happy. The other women are gone from the Dock Road and we search for the bits of coal that drop from lorries. Mam tells us gather anything that burns, coal, wood, cardboard, paper. She says, There are them that burn the horse droppings but we're not gone that low yet. When her bag is nearly full she says, Now we have to find an onion for Oliver. Malachy says he'll find one but she tells him, No, you don't find onions on the road, you get them in shops.\nThe minute he sees a shop he cries out, There's a shop, and runs\nin.\nOonyen, he says. Oonyen for Oliver.\nMam runs into the shop and tells the women behind the counter, I'm\nsorry. The woman says, Lord, he's a dote. Is he an American or what? Mam says he is. The woman smiles and shows two teeth, one on each\nside of her upper gum. A dote, she says, and look at them gorgeous goldy curls. And what is it he wants now? A sweet?\nAh, no, says Mam. An onion.\nThe woman laughs, An onion? I never heard a child wanting an onion before. Is that what they like in America?\nMam says, I just mentioned I wanted to get an onion for my other child that's sick. Boil the onion in milk, you know.\nTrue for you, missus. You can't beat the onion boiled in milk. And look, little boy, here's a sweet for yourself and one for the other little boy, the brother, I suppose.\nMam says, Ah, sure, you shouldn't. Say thank you, boys.\nThe woman says, Here's a nice onion for the sick child, missus.\nMam says, Oh, I can't buy the onion now, missus. I don't have a penny on me.\nI'm giving you the onion, missus. Let it never be said a child went sick in Limerick for want of an onion. And don't forget to sprinkle in a little pepper. Do you have pepper, missus?\nAh, no, I don't but I should be getting it any day now.\nWell, here, missus. Pepper and a little salt. Do the child all the good in the world.\nMam says, God bless you, ma'am, and her eyes are watery.\nDad is walking back and forth with Oliver in his arms and Eugene is playing on the floor with a pot and a spoon. Dad says, Did you get the onion?\nI did, says Mam, and more. I got coal and the way of lighting it. I knew you would. I said a prayer to St. Jude. He's my favorite saint, patron of desperate cases.\nI got the coal. I got the onion, no help from St. Jude.\nDad says, You shouldn't be picking up coal off the road like a common beggar. It isn't right. Bad example for the boys.\nThen you should have sent St. Jude down the Dock Road.\nMalachy says, I'm hungry, and I'm hungry, too, but Mam says, Ye'll wait till Oliver has his onion boiled in milk.\nShe gets the fire going, cuts the onion in half, drops it in the boiling milk with a little butter and sprinkles the milk with pepper. She takes Oliver on her lap and tries to feed him but he turns away and looks into the fire.\nAh, come on, love, she says. Good for you. Make you big and strong.\nHe tightens his mouth against the spoon. She puts the pot down, rocks him till he's asleep, lays him on the bed and tells the rest of us be quiet or she'll demolish us. She slices the other half of the onion and fries it in butter with slices of bread. She lets us sit on the floor around the fire where we eat the fried bread and sip at the scalding sweet tea in jam jars. She says, That fire is good and bright so we can turn off that gaslight till we get money for the meter.\nThe fire makes the room warm and with the flames dancing in the coal you can see faces and mountains and valleys and animals leaping. Eugene falls asleep on the floor and Dad lifts him to the bed beside Oliver. Mam puts the boiled onion pot up on the mantelpiece for fear a mouse or rat might be at it. She says she's tired out from the day, the Vincent de Paul Society, Mrs. McGrath's shop, the search for coal down the Dock Road, the worry over Oliver not wanting the boiled onion, and if he's like this tomorrow she's taking him to the doctor, and now she's going to bed.\nSoon we're all in bed and if there's the odd flea I don't mind because it's warm in the bed with the six of us and I love the glow of the fire the way it dances on the walls and ceiling and makes the room go red and black, red and black, till it dims to white and black and all you can hear is a little cry from Oliver turning in my mother's arms.\nIn the morning Dad is lighting the fire, making tea, cutting the bread. He's already dressed and he's telling Mam hurry up and get dressed. He says to me, Francis, your little brother Oliver is sick and we're taking him to the hospital. You are to be a good boy and take care of your two brothers. We'll be back soon.\nMam says, When we're out go easy with that sugar. We're not millionaires.\nWhen Mam picks up Oliver and wraps him in a coat Eugene stands on the bed. I want Ollie, he says. Ollie play.\nOllie will be back soon, she says, and you can play with him. Now you can play with Malachy and Frank.\nOllie, Ollie, I want Ollie.\nHe follows Oliver with his eyes and when they're gone he sits on the bed looking out the window. Malachy says, Genie, Genie, we have bread, we have tea. Sugar on your bread, Genie. He shakes his head and pushes away the bread Malachy is offering. He crawls to the place where Oliver slept with Mam, puts his head down and stares out the window.\nGrandma is at the door. I heard your father and mother were running down Henry Street with the child in their arms. Now where are they gone to?\nOliver is sick, I said. He wouldn't eat the boiled onion in milk. What are you blatherin' about?\nWouldn't eat the boiled onion and got sick.\nAnd who's minding ye?\nI am.\nAnd what's up with the child in the bed? What's That's Eugene. He misses Oliver. They're twins. I know they're twins. That child looks starved.\nhis name?\nHave ye any\nporridge here?\nWhat's porridge? says Malachy.\nJesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! What's porridge! Porridge is\nporridge. That's what porridge is. Ye are the most ignorant bunch o' Yanks I ever seen. Come on, put on yeer clothes and we'll go across the street to your aunt Aggie. She's there with the husband, Pa Keating, and she'll give ye some porridge.\nShe picks up Eugene, wraps him in her shawl and we cross the street to Aunt Aggie's. She's living with Uncle Pa again because he said she wasn't a fat cow after all.\nDo you have any porridge? Grandma says to Aunt Aggie.\nPorridge? Am I supposed to be feeding porridge to a crowd of Yanks? Pity about you, says Grandma. It won't kill you to give them a\nlittle porridge.\nAnd I suppose they'll be wanting sugar and milk on top of\neverything or they might be banging on my door looking for an egg if you don't mind. I don't know why we have to pay for Angela's mistakes.\nJesus, says Grandma, 'tis a good thing you didn't own that stable in Bethlehem or the Holy Family would still be wanderin' the world crumblin' with the hunger.\nGrandma pushes her way past Aunt Aggie, puts Eugene on a chair near the fire and makes the porridge. A man comes in from another room. He has black curly hair and his skin is black and I like his eyes because they're very blue and ready to smile. He's Aunt Aggie's husband, the man who stopped the night we were attacking the fleas and told us all about fleas and snakes, the man with the cough he got from swallowing gas in the war.\nMalachy says, Why are you all black? and Uncle Pa Keating laughs and coughs so hard he has to ease himself with a cigarette. Oh, the little Yanks, he says. They're not a bit shy. I'm black because I work at the Limerick Gas Works shoveling coal and coke into the furnaces. Gassed in France and back to Limerick to work in the gas works. When you grow up you'll laugh.\nMalachy and I have to leave the table so the big people can sit and have tea. They have their tea but Uncle Pa Keating, who is my uncle because he's married to my aunt Aggie, picks up Eugene and takes him on his lap. He says, This is a sad little fella, and makes funny faces and silly sounds. Malachy and I laugh but Eugene only reaches up to touch the blackness of Pa Keating's skin, and then when Pa pretends to bite his little hand, Eugene laughs and everyone in the room laughs. Malachy goes to Eugene and tries to make him laugh even more but Eugene turns away and hides his face in Pa Keating's shirt.\nI think he likes me, says Pa, and that's when Aunt Aggie puts down her teacup and starts to bawl, Waah, waah, waah, big teardrops tumbling down her fat red face.\nAw, Jesus, says Grandma, there she is again. What's up with you this time?\nAnd Aunt Aggie blubbers, To see Pa there with a child on his lap an' me with no hope of having my own.\nGrandma barks at her, Stop talkin' like that in front of the children. Have you no shame? When God is good and ready He'll send you your family.\nAunt Aggie sobs, Angela with five born an' one just gone an' her so useless she couldn't scrub a floor an' me with none an' I can scrub an' clean with the best and make any class of a stew or a fry.\nPa Keating laughs, I think I'll keep this little fella.\nMalachy runs to him. No, no, no. That's my brother, that's Eugene. And I say, No, no, no, that's our brother. Aunt Aggie pats the tears on her cheeks. She says, I don't want nothing of Angela's. I don't want nothing that's half Limerick and half North of Ireland, so I don't, so ye can take him home. I'll have me own someday if I have to do a hundred novenas to the Virgin Mary and her mother, St. Ann, or if I have to crawl from here to Lourdes on me two bended knees.\nGrandma says, That's enough. Ye have had yeer porridge and 'tis time to go home and see if yeer father and mother are back from the hospital.\nShe puts on her shawl and goes to pick up Eugene but he clutches so hard at Pa Keating's shirt she has to pull him away though he keeps looking back at Pa till we're out the door.\n***\nWe followed Grandma back to our room. She put Eugene in the bed and gave him a drink of water. She told him to be a good boy and go to sleep for his little brother, Oliver, would be home soon and they'd be playing again there on the floor.\nBut he kept looking out the window.\nShe told Malachy and me we could sit on the floor and play but to be quiet because she was going to say her prayers. Malachy went to the bed and sat by Eugene and I sat on a chair at the table making out words on the newspaper that was our tablecloth. All you could hear in the room was Malachy whispering to make Eugene happy and Grandma mumbling to the click of her rosary beads. It was so quiet I put my head on the table and fell asleep.\nDad is touching my shoulder. Come on, Francis, you have to take care of your little brothers.\nMam is slumped on the edge of the bed, making small crying sounds like a bird. Grandma is pulling on her shawl. She says, I'll go down to\nThompson the undertaker about the coffin and the carriage. The St. Vincent de Paul Society will surely pay for that, God knows.\nShe goes out the door. Dad stands facing the wall over the fire, beating on his thighs with his fists, sighing, Och, och, och.\nDad frightens me with his och, och, och, and Mam frightens me with her small bird sounds and I don't know what to do though I wonder if anyone will light the fire in the grate so that we can have tea and bread because it's a long time since we had the porridge. If Dad would move away from the fireplace I could light the fire myself. All you need is paper, a few bits of coal or turf, and a match. He won't move so I try to go around his legs while he's beating on his thighs but he notices me and wants to know why I'm trying to light the fire. I tell him we're all hungry and he lets out a crazy laugh. Hungry? he says. Och, Francis, your wee brother Oliver is dead. Your wee sister is dead and your wee brother is dead.\nHe picks me up and hugs me so hard I cry out. Then Malachy cries, my mother cries, Dad cries, I cry, but Eugene stays quiet. Then Dad sniffles, We'll have a feast. Come on, Francis.\nHe tells my mother we'll be back in awhile but she has Malachy and Eugene on her lap in the bed and she doesn't look up. He carries me through the streets of Limerick and we go from shop to shop with him asking for food or anything they can give to a family that has two children dead in a year, one in America, one in Limerick, and in danger of losing three more for the want of food and drink. Most shopkeepers shake their heads. Sorry for your troubles but you could go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or get the public assistance.\nDad says he's glad to see the spirit of Christ alive in Limerick and they tell him they don't need the likes of him with his northern accent to be telling them about Christ and he should be ashamed of himself dragging a child around like that like a common beggar, a tinker, a knacker.\nA few shopkeepers give bread, potatoes, tins of beans and Dad says, We'll go home now and you boys can eat something, but we meet Uncle Pa Keating and he tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and would Dad like to have a pint in this pub here?\nThere are men sitting in this pub with great glasses of black stuff before them. Uncle Pa Keating and Dad have the black stuff, too. They lift their glasses carefully and slowly drink. There is creamy white stuff on their lips, which they lick with little sighs. Uncle Pa gets me a bottle of lemonade and Dad gives me a piece of bread and I don't feel hungry anymore. Still, I wonder how long we'll sit here with Malachy and Eugene hungry at home, hours from the porridge, which Eugene didn't eat anyway.\nDad and Uncle Pa drink their glass of black stuff and have another. Uncle Pa says, Frankie, this is the pint. This is the staff of life. This is the best thing for nursing mothers and for those who are long weaned.\nHe laughs and Dad smiles and I laugh because I think that's what you're supposed to do when Uncle Pa says something. He doesn't laugh when he tells the other men about Oliver dying. The other men tip their hats to Dad. Sorry for your troubles, mister, and surely you'll have a pint.\nDad says yes to the pints and soon he's singing Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry and song after song I never heard before and crying over his lovely little girl, Margaret, that died in America and his little boy, Oliver, dead beyond in the City Home Hospital. It frightens me the way he\nyells and cries and sings and I wish I could be at home with my three brothers, no, my two brothers, and my mother.\nThe man behind the bar says to Dad, I think now, mister, you've had enough. We're sorry for your troubles but you have to take that child home to his mother that must be heartbroken by the fire.\nDad says, One, one more pint, just one, eh? and the man says no. Dad shakes his fist. I did me bit for Ireland, and when the man comes out and takes Dad's arm, Dad tries to push him away.\nUncle Pa says, Come on now, Malachy, stop the blaguarding. You have to go home to Angela. You have a funeral tomorrow and the lovely children waiting for you.\nBut Dad struggles till a few men push him out into the darkness. Uncle Pa stumbles out with the bag of food. Come on, he says. We'll go back to your room.\nDad wants to go to another place for a pint but Uncle Pa says he has no more money. Dad says he'll tell everyone his sorrows and they'll give him pints. Uncle Pa says that's a disgraceful thing to do and Dad cries on his shoulder. You're a good friend, he tells Uncle Pa. He cries again till Uncle Pa pats him on the back. It's terrible, terrible, says Uncle Pa, but you'll get over this in time.\nDad straightens up and looks at him. Never, he says. Never.\nNext day we rode to the hospital in a carriage with a horse. They put Oliver in a white box that came with us in the carriage and we took him to the graveyard. They put the white box into a hole in the ground and covered it with earth. My mother and Aunt Aggie cried, Grandma looked angry, Dad, Uncle Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat Sheehan looked sad but did not cry and I thought that if you're a man you can cry only when you have the black stuff that is called the pint.\nI did not like the jackdaws that perched on trees and gravestones and I did not want to leave Oliver with them. I threw a rock at a jackdaw that waddled over toward Oliver's grave. Dad said I shouldn't throw rocks at jackdaws, they might be somebody's soul. I didn't know what a soul was but I didn't ask him because I didn't care. Oliver was dead and I hated jackdaws. I'd be a man someday and I'd come back with a bag of rocks and I'd leave the graveyard littered with dead jackdaws.\nThe morning after Oliver's burial Dad went to the Labour Exchange to sign and collect the week's dole, nineteen shillings and sixpence. He said he'd be home by noon, that he'd get coal and make a fire, that we'd have rashers and eggs and tea in honor of Oliver, that we might even have a sweet or two.\nHe wasn't home by noon, or one, or two, and we boiled and ate the few potatoes the shopkeepers had given the day before. He wasn't home anytime before the sun went down that day in May. There was no sign of him till we heard him, long after the pubs closed, rolling along Windmill Street, singing, When all around a vigil keep, The West's asleep, the West's asleep- Alas, and well may Erin weep When Connacht lies in slumber deep.\nThere lake and plain smile fair and free, 'Mid rocks their guardian chivalry.\nSing, Oh, let man learn liberty\nFrom crashing wind and lashing sea.\nHe stumbled into the room, hanging on to the wall. A snot oozed from his nose and he wiped it away with the back of his hand. He tried to speak. Zeeze shildren should be in bed. Lishen to me. Shildren go to bed.\nMam faced him. These children are hungry. Where's the dole money? We'll get fish and chips so they'll have something in their bellies when they go to sleep.\nShe tried to stick her hands into his pockets but he pushed her away. Have respheck, he said. Reshpeck in front of shildren.\nShe struggled to get at his pockets. Where's the money? The children are hungry. You mad oul' bastard, did you drink all the money again? Just what you did in Brooklyn.\nHe blubbered, Och, poor Angela. And poor wee Margaret and poor wee Oliver.\nHe staggered to me and hugged me and I smelled the drink I used to smell in America. My face was wet from his tears and his spit and his snot and I was hungry and I didn't know what to say when he cried all over my head.\nThen he let me go and hugged Malachy, still going on about the wee sister and the wee brother cold in the ground, and how we all have to pray and be good, how we have to be obedient and do what our mother tells us. He said we have our troubles but it's time for Malachy and me to start school because there's nothing like an education, it will stand to you in the end, and you have to get ready to do your bit for Ireland.\n***\nMam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Windmill Street. She can't sleep with the memory of Oliver in that room, Oliver in the bed, Oliver playing on the floor, Oliver sitting on Dad's lap by the fire. She says it's not good for Eugene to be in that place, that a twin will suffer more over the loss of his brother than even a mother can understand. There's a room going on Hartstonge Street with two beds instead of the one we have here for the six of us, no, the five of us. We're getting that room and to make sure she's going to the Labour Exchange on Thursday to stand in the queue to take the dole money the minute it's handed to Dad. He says she can't do that, he'd be disgraced with the other men. The Labour Exchange is a place for men not for women taking the money from under their noses. She says, Pity about you. If you didn't squander the money in the pubs I wouldn't have to follow you the way I did in Brooklyn.\nHe tells her he'll be shamed forever. She says she doesn't care. She wants that room on Hartstonge Street, a nice warm comfortable room with a lavatory down the hall like the one in Brooklyn, a room without fleas and the dampness that kills. She wants that room because it's on the same street as Leamy's National School and Malachy and I can come home at the dinner hour, which is noon, for a cup of tea and a cut of fried bread.\nOn Thursday Mam follows Dad to the Labour Exchange. She marches in behind him and when the man pushes the money toward Dad she takes it. The other men on the dole nudge each other and grin and Dad is disgraced because a woman is never supposed to interfere with a man's dole money. He might want to put sixpence on a horse or have a pint and if all the women start acting like Mam the horses will stop running and Guinness will go broke. But she has the money now and we move to Hartstonge Street. Then she carries Eugene in her arms and we go up the street to Leamy's National School. The headmaster, Mr. Scallan, says we are to\nreturn on Monday with a composition book, a pencil, and a pen with a good nib on it. We are not to come to school with ringworm or lice and our noses are to be blown at all times, not on the floor, that spreads the consumption, or on our sleeves, but in a handkerchief or a clean rag. He asks us if we are good boys and when we say we are, he says, Good Lord, what's this? Are they Yanks or what?\nMam tells him about Margaret and Oliver and he says, Lord above, Lord above, there's great suffering in the world. Anyway, we'll put the little fellow, Malachy, in the infants' class and his brother in first class. They're in the same room with one master. Monday morning, then, nine o'clock prompt.\nThe boys in Leamy's want to know why we talk like that. Are ye Yanks or what? And when we tell them we came from America they want to know, Are ye gangsters or cowboys?\nA big boy sticks his face up to mine. I'm asking ye a question, he says. Are ye gangsters or cowboys?\nI tell him I don't know and when he pokes his finger into my chest Malachy says, I'm a gangster, Frank's a cowboy. The big boy says, Your little brother is smart and you're a stupid Yank.\nThe boys around him are excited. Fight, they yell, fight, and he pushes me so hard I fall. I want to cry but the blackness comes over me the way it did with Freddie Leibowitz and I rush at him, kicking and punching. I knock him down and try to grab his hair to bang his head on the ground but there's a sharp sting across the backs of my legs and I'm pulled away from him.\nMr. Benson, the master, has me by the ear and he's whacking me across the legs. You little hooligan, he says. Is that the kind of behavior you brought from America? Well, by God, you'll behave yourself before I'm done with you.\nHe tells me hold out one hand and then the other and hits me with his stick once on each hand. Go home now, he says, and tell your mother what a bad boy you were. You're a bad Yank. Say after me, I'm a bad boy.\nI'm a bad boy.\nNow say, I'm a bad Yank.\nI'm a bad Yank.\nMalachy says, He's not a bad boy. It's that big boy. He said we\nwere cowboys and gangsters.\nIs that what you did, Heffernan?\nI was only jokin', sir.\nNo more joking, Heffernan. It's not their fault that they're Yanks. 'Tisn't, sir.\nAnd you, Heffernan, should get down on your two knees every night\nand thank God you're not a Yank for if you were, Heffernan, you'd be the greatest gangster on two sides of the Atlantic. Al Capone would be coming to you for lessons. You're not to be bothering these two Yanks anymore, Heffernan.\nI won't, sir.\nAnd if you do, Heffernan, I'll hang your pelt on the wall. Now go home, all of ye.\nThere are seven masters in Leamy's National School and they all have leather straps, canes, blackthorn sticks. They hit you with the sticks on the shoulders, the back, the legs, and, especially, the hands. If they hit you on the hands it's called a slap. They hit you if you're\nlate, if you have a leaky nib on your pen, if you laugh, if you talk, and if you don't know things.\nThey hit you if you don't know why God made the world, if you don't know the patron saint of Limerick, if you can't recite the Apostles' Creed, if you can't add nineteen to forty-seven, if you can't subtract nineteen from forty-seven, if you don't know the chief towns and products of the thirty-two counties of Ireland, if you can't find Bulgaria on the wall map of the world that's blotted with spit, snot, and blobs of ink thrown by angry pupils expelled forever.\nThey hit you if you can't say your name in Irish, if you can't say the Hail Mary in Irish, if you can't ask for the lavatory pass in Irish. It helps to listen to the big boys ahead of you. They can tell you\nabout the master you have now, what he likes and what he hates.\nOne master will hit you if you don't know that Eamon De Valera is\nthe greatest man that ever lived. Another master will hit you if you don't know that Michael Collins was the greatest man that ever lived.\nMr. Benson hates America and you have to remember to hate America or he'll hit you.\nMr. O'Dea hates England and you have to remember to hate England or he'll hit you.\nIf you ever say anything good about Oliver Cromwell they'll all hit\nyou.\nEven if they slap you six times on each hand with the ash plant or\nthe blackthorn with the knobs you must not cry. You'll be a sissy. There are boys who might jeer at you and mock you on the street but even they have to be careful because the day will come when the master hits and slaps them and they have to keep the tears behind their eyes or be disgraced forever. Some boys say it is better to cry because that pleases the masters. If you don't cry the masters hate you because you've made them look weak before the class and they promise themselves the next time they have you up they'll draw tears or blood or both.\nBig boys in fifth class tell us Mr. O'Dea likes to get you in front of the class so that he can stand behind you, pinch your sideburns, which are called cossicks, pull up on them. Up, up, he says, till you're on tiptoe and the tears are filling your eyes. You don't want the boys in the class to see you cry but pulling on the cossicks makes the tears come whether you like it or not and the master likes that. Mr. O'Dea is the one master who can always bring the tears and the shame.\nIt is better not to cry because you have to stick with the boys in the school and you never want to give the masters any satisfaction.\nIf the master hits you there's no use complaining to your father or mother. They always say, You deserve it. Don't be a baby.\nI know Oliver is dead and Malachy knows Oliver is dead but Eugene is too small to know anything. When he wakes in the morning he says, Ollie, Ollie, and toddles around the room looking under the beds or he climbs up on the bed by the window and points to children on the street, especially children with fair hair like him and Oliver. Ollie, Ollie, he says, and Mam picks him up, sobs, hugs him. He struggles to get down because he doesn't want to be picked up and hugged. He wants to find Oliver.\nDad and Mam tell him Oliver is in heaven playing with angels and we'll all see him again someday but he doesn't understand because he's only two and doesn't have the words and that's the worst thing in the whole world.\nMalachy and I play with him. We try to make him laugh. We make funny faces. We put pots on our heads and pretend to let them fall off. We run across the room and pretend to fall down. We take him to the People's Park to see the lovely flowers, play with dogs, roll in the grass.\nHe sees small children with fair hair like Oliver. He doesn't say Ollie anymore. He only points.\nDad says Eugene is lucky to have brothers like Malachy and me because we help him forget and soon, with God's help, he'll have no memory of Oliver at all.\n***\nHe died anyway.\nSix months after Oliver went, we woke on a mean November morning\nand there was Eugene, cold in the bed beside us. Dr. Troy came and said that child died of pneumonia and why wasn't he in the hospital long ago? Dad said he didn't know and Mam said she didn't know and Dr. Troy said that's why children die. People don't know. He said if Malachy or I showed the slightest sign of a cough or the faintest rattle in the throat we were to be brought to him no matter what time of day or night. We were to be kept dry at all times because there seemed to be a bit of a weakness in the chest in this family. He told Mam he was very sorry for her troubles and he'd give her a prescription for something to ease the pain of the days to come. He said God was asking too much, too damn much.\nGrandma came over to our room with Aunt Aggie. She washed Eugene, and Aunt Aggie went to a shop for a little white gown and a set of rosary beads. They dressed him in a white gown and laid him on the bed by the window where he used to look out for Oliver. They placed his hands on his chest, one hand on top of the other, bound in the little white rosary beads. Grandma brushed the hair back from his eyes and forehead and she said, Doesn't he have lovely soft silky hair? Mam went to the bed and pulled a blanket over his legs to keep him warm. Grandma and Aunt Aggie looked at each other and said nothing. Dad stood at the end of the bed beating his fists against his thighs, talking to Eugene, telling him, Och, it was the River Shannon that harmed you, the dampness from that river that came and took you and Oliver. Grandma said, Will you stop that? You're making the whole house nervous. She took Dr. Troy's prescription and told me run over to O'Connor the chemist for the pills, that there would be no charge due to the kindness of Dr. Troy. Dad said he'd come with me, that we'd go to the Jesuit church and say a prayer for Margaret and Oliver and Eugene, all happy in heaven. The chemist gave us the pills, we stopped to say the prayers, and when we returned to the room, Grandma gave Dad money to bring a few bottles of stout from the pub. Mam said, No, no, but Grandma said, He doesn't have the pills to ease him, God help us, and a bottle of stout will be some small comfort. Then she told him he'd have to go to the undertaker tomorrow to bring the coffin back in a carriage. She told me to go with my father and make sure he didn't stay in the pub all night and drink all the money. Dad said, Och, Frankie shouldn't be in pubs, and she said, Then don't stay there. He put on his cap and we went to South's pub and he told me at the door I could go home now, that he'd be home after one pint. I said, No, and he said, Don't be disobedient. Go home to your poor mother. I said, No, and he said I was a bad boy and God would be displeased. I said I wasn't going home without him and he said, Och, what is the world coming to? He had one quick pint of porter in the pub and we went home with the bottles\nof stout. Pa Keating was in our room with a small bottle of whiskey and bottles of stout and Uncle Pat Sheehan brought two bottles of stout for himself. Uncle Pat sat on the floor with his arms around his bottles and he kept saying, They're mine, they're mine, for fear they'd be taken from him. People who were dropped on their heads always worry someone will steal their stout. Grandma said, All right, Pat, drink your stout yourself. No one will bother you. She and Aunt Aggie sat on the bed by Eugene. Pa Keating sat at the kitchen table drinking his stout and offering everyone a sip of his whiskey. Mam took her pills and sat by the fire with Malachy on her lap. She kept saying Malachy had hair like Eugene and Aunt Aggie said no he did not till Grandma drove her elbow into Aunt Aggie's chest and told her shut up. Dad stood against the wall drinking his stout between the fireplace and the bed with Eugene. Pa Keating told stories and the big people laughed even though they didn't want to laugh or they weren't supposed to laugh in the presence of a dead child. He said when he was in the English army in France the Germans sent gas over which made him so sick they had to take him to the hospital. They kept him in the hospital a while and then sent him back to the trenches. English soldiers were sent home but they didn't give a fiddler's fart about the Irish soldiers, whether they lived or died. Instead of dying Pa made a vast fortune. He said he solved one of the great problems of trench warfare. In the trenches it was so wet and muddy they had no way of boiling the water for the tea. He said to himself, Jasus, I have all this gas in my system and 'tis a great pity to waste it. So he shoved a pipe up his arse, lit a match to it, and there in a second he had a fine flame ready to boil water in any billycan. Tommies came running from trenches all around when they heard the news and they gave him any amount of money if he'd let them boil water. He made so much money he was able to bribe the generals to let him out of the army and off he went to Paris where he had a fine time drinking wine with artists and models. He had such a high time of it he spent all his money and when he came back to Limerick the only job he could get was in the gas works shoveling coal into the furnaces. He said there was so much gas in his system now he could supply light to a small town for a year. Aunt Aggie sniffed and said that was not a proper story to be telling in the presence of a dead child and Grandma said it was better to have a story like that than to be sitting around with the long face. Uncle Pat Sheehan, sitting on the floor with his stout, said he was going to sing a song. More power to you, said Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat sang \"The Road to Rasheen. \" He kept saying, Rasheen, Rasheen, mavourneen mean, and the song made no sense because his father dropped him on his head long ago and every time he sang that song he had different words. Grandma said that was a fine song and Pa Keating said Caruso better look over his shoulder. Dad went over to the bed in the corner where he slept with Mam. He sat on the edge, put his bottle on the floor, covered his face with his hands and cried. He said, Frank, Frank, come here, and I had to go to him so that he could hug me the way Mam was hugging Malachy. Grandma said, We better go now and sleep a bit before the funeral tomorrow. They each knelt by the bed and said a prayer and kissed Eugene's forehead. Dad put me down, stood up and nodded to them as they left. When they were gone he lifted each of the stout bottles to his mouth and drained it. He ran his finger inside the whiskey bottle and licked it. He turned down the flame in the paraffin oil lamp on the table and said it was time for Malachy and me to be in bed. We'd have to sleep with him and Mam that\nnight as little Eugene would be needing the bed for himself. It was dark in the room now except for the sliver of streetlight that fell on Eugene's lovely soft silky hair.\nDad lights the fire in the morning, makes the tea, toasts the bread in the fire. He brings Mam's toast and tea but she waves it away and turns to the wall. He brings Malachy and me to Eugene to kneel and say a prayer. He says the prayers of one child like us are worth more in heaven than the prayers of ten cardinals and forty bishops. He shows us how to bless ourselves, In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen, and he says, Dear God, this is what you want, isn't it? You want my son, Eugene. You took his brother, Oliver, You took his sister, Margaret. I'm not supposed to question that, am I? Dear God above, I don't know why children have to die but that is Your will. You told the river to kill and the Shannon killed. Could You at last be merciful? Could You leave us the children we have? That is all we ask. Amen.\nHe helps Malachy and me wash our heads and feet so that we'll be clean for Eugene's funeral. We have to be very quiet even when he hurts us cleaning our ears with the corner of the towel we brought from America. We have to be quiet because Eugene is there with his eyes closed and we don't want him to be waking up and looking out the window for Oliver.\nGrandma comes and tells Mam she has to get up. There are children dead, she says, but there are children alive and they need their mother. She brings Mam a little tea in a mug to wash down the pills that ease the pain. Dad tells Grandma it's Thursday and he has to go to the Labour Exchange for the dole and then down to the undertaker to bring the mourning carriage and the coffin. Grandma tells him to take me with him but he says it's better for me to stay with Malachy so that I can pray for my little brother dead in the bed. Grandma says, Is it coddin' me you are? Pray for a little child that's barely two and already playing with his little brother in heaven? You'll take your son with you and he'll remind you this is no day for the pubs. She looks at him and he looks at her and he puts on his cap.\nAt the Labour Exchange we stand at the end of the queue till a man comes from behind the counter and tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and he should go ahead of everyone else on this sorrowful day. Men touch their caps and say they're sorry for his troubles and some pat my head and give me pennies, twenty-four pennies, two shillings. Dad tells me I'm rich now and I should buy myself a sweet while he goes into this place for a minute. I know this place is a pub and I know he wants to get the black stuff that is called a pint but I don't say anything because I want to go to the shop next door for a piece of toffee. I chew my toffee till it melts and leaves my mouth all sweet and sticky. Dad is still in the pub and I wonder if I should get another piece of toffee as long as he's in there with the pint. I'm about to give the money to the woman in the shop when my hand is slapped down and there's Aunt Aggie, raging. Is this what you do, she says, on the day of your brother's funeral? Gorgin' yourself on sweets. And where's that father of yours?\nHe's, he's, in the pub.\nOf course he's in the pub. You out here stuffin' yourself with sweets and him in there gettin' himself into a staggerin' condition the day your poor little brother goes to the graveyard.\nShe tells the shop woman, Just like his father, the same odd manner, the same oul' northern jaw. She tells me get into that pub and tell my father to stop the drinking and get the coffin and the carriage. She will not set foot inside the pub for the drink is the curse of this poor godforsaken country.\nDad is sitting at the back of the pub with a man who has a dirty face and hair growing out of his nose. They're not talking but staring straight ahead and their black pints are resting on a small white coffin on the seat between them. I know that's Eugene's coffin because Oliver had one like it and I want to cry when I see the black pints on top of it. I'm sorry now I ever ate that toffee and I wish I could take it out of my stomach and give it back to the woman in the shop because it's not right to be eating toffee when Eugene is dead in the bed and I'm frightened by the two black pints on his white coffin. The man with Dad is saying, No, mister, you can't leave a child's coffin in a carriage no more. I did that once, went in for a pint and they robbed that little coffin out of the bloody carriage. Can you credit that? It was empty, thank God, but there you are. Desperate times we live in, desperate. The man with Dad lifts his pint and takes a long swallow and when he puts his glass down there's a hollow sound in the coffin. Dad nods at me. We'll be going in a minute, son, but when he goes to put his glass on the coffin after the long swallow I push it away.\nThat's Eugene's coffin. I'll tell Mam you put your glass on Eugene's coffin.\nNow, son. Now, son.\nDad, that's Eugene's coffin. The other man says, Will we have another pint, mister?\nDad says to me, Wait outside another few minutes, Francis. No.\nDon't be a bad boy.\nNo.\nThe other man says, By Jesus, if that was my son I'd kick his arse from here to the County Kerry. He have no right to be talkin' to his father in that manner on a sorrowful day. If a man can't have a pint the day of a funeral what's the use of livin' at all, at all.\nDad says, All right. We'll go.\nThey finish their pints and wipe the wet brown stains off the coffin with their sleeves. The man climbs up to the driver's seat of the carriage and Dad and I ride inside. He has the coffin on his lap and he presses it against his chest. At home our room is filled with big people, Mam, Grandma, Aunt Aggie, her husband, Pa Keating, Uncle Pat Sheehan, Uncle Tom Sheehan, who is Mam's oldest brother and who never came near us before because he hates people from the North of Ireland. Uncle Tom has his wife, Jane, with him. She's from Galway and people say she has the look of a Spaniard and that's why no one in the family talks to her.\nThe man takes the coffin from Dad and when he brings it into the room Mam moans, Oh, no, oh, God, no. The man tells Grandma he'll be back in awhile to take us to the graveyard. Grandma tells him he'd better not come back to this house in a drunken state because this child that's going to the graveyard suffered greatly and deserves a bit of dignity and she won't put up with a driver that's drunk and ready to fall out of the high seat.\nThe man says, Missus, I drove dozens o' children to the graveyard an' never once fell out of any seat, high or low.\nThe men are drinking stout from bottles again and the women are sipping sherry from jam jars. Uncle Pat Sheehan tells everyone, This is my stout, this is my stout, and Grandma says, 'Tis all right, Pat. No one will take your stout. Then he says he wants to sing \"The Road to Rasheen\" till Pa Keating says, No, Pat, you can't sing on the day of a funeral. You can sing the night before. But Uncle Pat keeps saying, This is my stout and I want to sing \"The Road to Rasheen, \" and everyone knows he talks like that because he was dropped on his head. He starts to sing his song but stops when Grandma takes the lid off the coffin and Mam sobs, Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus, will it ever stop? Will I be left with one child?\nMam is sitting on a chair at the head of the bed. She's stroking Eugene's hair and face and hands. She tells him that of all the children in the world he was the sweetest and the most delicate and loving. She tells him 'tis a terrible thing to lose him but isn't he in heaven now with his brother and his sister and isn't that a comfort to us, knowing Oliver is no longer lonesome for his twin. Still, she puts her head down next to Eugene and cries so hard all the women in the room cry with her. She cries till Pa Keating tells her we have to go before the darkness falls, that we can't be in graveyards in the dark.\nGrandma whispers to Aunt Aggie, Who'll put the child in the coffin? and Aunt Aggie whispers, I won't. That's the job for the mother.\nUncle Pat hears them. I'll put the child in the coffin, he says. He limps to the bed and places his arms around Mam's shoulders. She looks up at him and her face is drenched. He says, I'll put the child in the coffin, Angela.\nOh, Pat, she says. Pat.\nI can do it, he says. Sure he's only a small child an' I never lifted a small child before in my life. I never had a small child in me arms. I won't drop him, Angela. I won't. Honest to God, I won't.\nI know you won't, Pat. I know you won't.\nI'll lift him an' I won't be singin'\"The Road to Rasheen.\"\nI know you won't, Pat, Mam says.\nPat pulls down the blanket Mam put there to keep Eugene warm.\nEugene's feet are white and bright with little blue veins. Pat bends over, picks up Eugene and holds him against his chest. He kisses Eugene's forehead and then everyone in the room kisses Eugene. He places Eugene in the coffin and steps back. We are all gathered around looking at Eugene for the last time.\nUncle Pat says, See, I didn't drop him, Angela, and she touches his\nface.\nAunt Aggie goes to the pub for the driver. He puts the lid on the\ncoffin and screws it down. He says, Who's comin' in the carriage? and takes the coffin to the carriage. There's room only for Mam and Dad, Malachy and me. Grandma says, Ye go ahead to the graveyard and we'll wait here.\nI don't know why we can't keep Eugene. I don't know why they have to send him away with that man who puts his pint on the white coffin. I don't know why they had to send Margaret away and Oliver. It is a bad thing to put my sister and my brothers in a box and I wish I could say something to someone.\nThe horse clop-clopped through the streets of Limerick. Malachy said, Are we going to see Oliver? and Dad said, No, Oliver is in heaven and don't ask me what heaven is because I don't know.\nMam said, Heaven is a place where Oliver and Eugene and Margaret are happy and warm and we'll see them there some day.\nMalachy said, The horse did his doodoo on the street and there was a smell, and Mam and Dad had to smile.\nAt the graveyard the driver climbs down and opens the door of the carriage. Gimme that coffin, he says, an' I'll carry it up to the grave. He yanks at the coffin and stumbles. Mam says, You're not carrying my child in the condition you're in. She turns to Dad. You carry him, she says. Do what you like, says the driver.\nDo what you bloody well like, and he climbs up to his seat.\nIt's getting dark now and the coffin seems whiter than ever in Dad's arms. Mam takes our hands and we follow Dad through the graves. The jackdaws are quiet in the trees because their day is nearly over and they have to rest so that they can get up early in the morning and feed their babies.\nTwo men with shovels are waiting by a small open grave. One man says, Ye are very late. Good thing this is a small job or we'd be gone. He climbs into the grave. Hand it to me, he says, and Dad hands him the coffin.\nThe man sprinkles some straw and grass on the coffin and as he climbs out the other man shovels in the earth. Mam lets out a long cry, Oh, Jesus, Jesus, and a jackdaw croaks in a tree. I wish I had a rock to hit that jackdaw. When the men finish shoveling in the earth they wipe their foreheads and wait. One says, Ah, well, now, there's usually a little something for the thirst that's in it.\nDad says, Oh, yes, yes, and gives them money. They say, Sorry for your troubles, and they leave.\nWe make our way back to the carriage at the graveyard gate but the carriage is gone. Dad looks around in the darkness and comes back shaking his head. Mam says, That driver is nothing but a dirty old drunkard, God forgive me.\nIt's a long walk from the graveyard to our room. Mam tells Dad, These children need some nourishment and you have money left from the dole this morning. If you're thinking of going to the pubs tonight you can forget it. We're taking them to Naughton's and they can have fish and chips and lemonade for 'tisn't every day they bury a brother.\nThe fish and chips are delicious with vinegar and salt and the lemonade is tart in our throats.\nWhen we get home the room is empty. There are empty stout bottles on the table and the fire is out. Dad lights the paraffin oil lamp and you can see the hollow left in the pillow by Eugene's head. You expect to hear him and see him toddling across the room, climbing up on the bed to look out the window for Oliver.\nDad tells Mam he's going out for a walk. She says no. She knows what he's up to, that he can't wait to spend his last few shillings in the pubs. All right, he says. He lights the fire and Mam makes tea and soon we're in bed.\nMalachy and I are back in the bed where Eugene died. I hope he's not cold in that white coffin in the graveyard though I know he's not there anymore because angels come to the graveyard and open the coffin and he's far from the Shannon dampness that kills, up in the sky in heaven with Oliver and Margaret where they have plenty of fish and chips and toffee and no aunts to bother you, where all the fathers bring home\nthe money from the Labour Exchange and you don't have to be running around to pubs to find them.\nIII\nMam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Hartstonge Street. She sees Eugene morning, noon and night. She sees him climbing the bed to look out at the street for Oliver and sometimes she sees Oliver outside and Eugene inside, the two of them chatting away. She's happy they're chatting like that but she doesn't want to be seeing and hearing them the rest of her life. It's a shame to move when we're so near Leamy's National School but if she doesn't move soon she'll go out of her mind and wind up in the lunatic asylum.\nWe move to Roden Lane on top of a place called Barrack Hill. There are six houses on one side of the lane, one on the opposite side. The houses are called two up, two down, two rooms on top, two on the bottom. Our house is at the end of the lane, the last of the six. Next to our door is a small shed, a lavatory, and next to that a stable.\nMam goes to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to see if there's any chance of getting furniture. The man says he'll give us a docket for a table, two chairs, and two beds. He says we'll have to go to a second- hand furniture shop down in the Irishtown and haul the furniture home ourselves. Mam says we can use the pram she had for the twins and when she says that she cries. She wipes her eyes on her sleeves and asks the man if the beds we're getting are secondhand. He says of course they are, and she says she's very worried about sleeping in beds someone might have died in, especially if they had the consumption. The man says, I'm very sorry, but beggars can't be choosers.\nIt takes us all day to haul the furniture on the pram from one end of Limerick to the other. There are four wheels on the pram but one is bockety, it wants to go in a different direction. We have two beds, one sideboard with a mirror, a table and two chairs. We're happy with the house. We can walk from room to room and up and down the stairs. You feel very rich when you can go up and down the stairs all day as much as you please. Dad lights the fire and Mam makes the tea. He sits at the table on one chair, she sits on the other and Malachy and I sit on the trunk we brought from America. While we're drinking our tea an old man passes our door with a bucket in his hand. He empties the bucket into the lavatory and flushes and there's a powerful stink in our kitchen. Mam goes to the door and says, Why are you emptying your bucket in our lavatory? He raises his cap to her. Your lavatory, missus? Ah, no. You're making a bit of a mistake there, ha, ha. This is not your lavatory. Sure, isn't this the lavatory for the whole lane. You'll see passing your door here the buckets of eleven families and I can tell you it gets very powerful here in the warm weather, very powerful altogether. 'Tis December now, thank God, with a chill in the air and Christmas around the corner and the lavatory isn't that bad, but the day will come when you'll be calling for a gas mask. So, good night to you, missus, and I hope you'll be happy in your house.\nMam says, Wait a minute, sir. Could you tell me who cleans this lavatory?\nCleans? Ah, Jasus, that's a good one. Cleans, she says. Is it joking you are? These houses were built in the time of Queen Victoria herself and if this lavatory was ever cleaned it must have been done by someone in the middle of the night when no one was lookin'.\nAnd he shuffles up the lane laughing away to himself.\nMam comes back to her chair and her tea. We can't stay here, she says. That lavatory will kill us with all diseases.\nDad says, We can't move again. Where will we get a house for six shillings a week? We'll keep the lavatory clean ourselves. We'll boil buckets of water and throw them in there.\nOh, will we? says Mam, and where will we get the coal or turf or blocks to be boiling water?\nDad says nothing. He finishes his tea and looks for a nail to hang our one picture. The man in the picture has a thin face. He wears a yellow skullcap and a black robe with a cross on his chest. Dad says he was a Pope, Leo the Thirteenth, a great friend of the workingman. He brought this picture all the way from America where he found it thrown out by someone who had no time for the workingman. Mam says he's talking a lot of bloody nonsense and he says she shouldn't say bloody in front of the children. Dad finds a nail but wonders how he's going to get it into the wall without a hammer. Mam says he could go borrow one from the people next door but he says you don't go around borrowing from people you don't know. He leans the picture against the wall and drives the nail with the bottom of a jam jar. The jam jar breaks and cuts his hand and a blob of blood falls on the Pope's head. He wraps his hand in the dish rag and tells Mam, Quick, quick, wipe the blood off the Pope before it dries. She tries to wipe the blood away with her sleeve but it's wool and spreads the blood till the whole side of the Pope's face is smeared. Dad says, Lord above, Angela, you've destroyed the Pope entirely, and she says, Arrah, stop your whining, we'll get some paint and go over his face some day, and Dad says, He's the only Pope that was ever a friend to the workingman and what are we to say if someone from the St. Vincent de Paul Society comes in and sees blood all over him? Mam says, I don't know. It's your blood and 'tis a sad thing when a man can't even drive a nail straight. It just goes to show how useless you are. You'd be better off digging fields and anyway I don't care. I have pain in my back and I'm going to bed.\nOch, what am I going to do? Dad says.\nTake down the Pope and hide him in the coal hole under the stairs where he won't be seen and he'll be out of harm's way.\nI can't, says Dad. It would be bad luck. Coal hole is no place for a Pope. When the Pope is up, he's up.\nSuit yourself, says Mam.\nI will, says Dad.\nThis is our first Christmas in Limerick and the girls are out in\nthe lane, skipping rope and singing, Christmas is coming And the goose is getting fat, Please put a penny In the old man's hat.\nIf you haven't a penny\nA ha'penny will do\nAnd if you haven't a ha'penny\nGod bless you.\nBoys tease the girls and call out,\nMay your mother have an accident\nAbroad in the loo.\nMam says she'd like to have a nice Christmas dinner but what can you do when the Labour Exchange reduces the dole to sixteen shillings after Oliver and Eugene died? You pay the rent of six shillings, you have ten shillings left, and what use is that to four people?\nDad can't get any work. He gets up early on weekdays, lights the fire, boils water for the tea and his shaving mug. He puts on a shirt and attaches a collar with studs. He puts on his tie and his cap and goes to the Labour Exchange to sign for the dole. He will never leave the house without collar and tie. A man without collar and tie is a man with no respect for himself. You never know when the clerk at the Labour Exchange might tell you there's a job going at Rank's Flour Mills or the Limerick Cement Company, and even if it's a laboring job what will they think if you appear without collar and tie?\nBosses and foremen always show him respect and say they're ready to hire him, but when he opens his mouth and they hear the North of Ireland accent, they take a Limerickman instead. That's what he tells Mam by the fire and when she says, Why don't you dress like a proper workingman? he says he'll never give an inch, never let them know, and when she says, Why can't you try to talk like a Limerickman? he says he'll never sink that low and the greatest sorrow of his life is that his sons are now afflicted with the Limerick accent. She says, Sorry for your troubles and I hope that's all you'll ever have, and he says that some day, with God's help, we'll get out of Limerick and far from the Shannon that kills.\nI ask Dad what afflicted means and he says, Sickness, son, and things that don't fit.\nWhen he's not looking for work Dad goes for long walks, miles into the country. He asks farmers if they need any help, that he grew up on a farm and can do anything. If they hire him he goes to work right away with his cap on and his collar and tie. He works so hard and long the farmers have to tell him to stop. They wonder how a man can work through a long hot day with no thought of food or drink. Dad smiles. He never brings home the money he earns on farms. That money seems to be different from the dole, which is supposed to be brought home. He takes the farm money to the pub and drinks it. If he's not home when the Angelus rings at six o'clock Mam knows he had a day of work. She hopes he might think of his family and pass the pub even once, but he never does. She hopes he might bring home something from the farm, potatoes, cabbage, turnips, carrots, but he'll never bring home anything because he'd never stoop so low as to ask a farmer for anything. Mam says 'tis all right for her to be begging at the St. Vincent de Paul Society for a docket for food but he can't stick a few spuds in his pocket. He says it's different for a man. You have to keep the dignity. Wear your collar and tie, keep up the appearance, and never ask for anything. Mam says, I hope it keeps fine for you.\nWhen the farm money is gone he rolls home singing and crying over Ireland and his dead children, mostly about Ireland. If he sings Roddy McCorley, it means he had only the price of a pint or two. If he sings Kevin Barry, it means he had a good day, that he is now falling down drunk and ready to get us out of bed, line us up and make us promise to die for Ireland, unless Mam tells him leave us alone or she'll brain him with the poker.\nYou wouldn't do that, Angela.\nI would and more. You better stop the nonsense and go to bed.\nBed, bed, bed. What's the use of going to bed? If I go to bed I'll\nonly have to get up again and I can't sleep in a place where there's a river sending poison to us in mist and fog.\nHe goes to bed, pounds the wall with his fist, sings a woeful song, falls asleep. He's up at daylight because no one should sleep beyond the dawn. He wakes Malachy and me and we're tired from being kept up the night before with his talking and singing. We complain and say we're sick, we're tired, but he pulls back the overcoats that cover us and forces us out on the floor. It's December and it's freezing and we can see our breath. We pee into the bucket by the bedroom door and run down stairs for the warmth of the fire Dad has already started. We wash our faces and hands in a basin that sits under the water tap by the door. The pipe that leads to the tap has to be held to the wall by a piece of twine looped around a nail. Everything around the tap is damp, the floor, the wall, the chair the basin sits on. The water from the tap is icy and our fingers turn numb. Dad says this is good for us, it will make men of us. He throws the icy water on his face and neck and chest to show there's nothing to fear. We hold our hands to the fire for the heat that's in it but we can't stay there long because we have to drink our tea and eat our bread and go to school. Dad makes us say grace before meals and grace after meals and he tells us be good boys at school because God is watching every move and the slightest disobedience will send us straight to hell where we'll never have to worry about the cold again.\nAnd he smiles.\nTwo weeks before Christmas Malachy and I come home from school in a heavy rain and when we push in the door we find the kitchen empty. The table and chairs and trunk are gone and the fire is dead in the grate. The Pope is still there and that means we haven't moved again. Dad would never move without the Pope. The kitchen floor is wet, little pools of water all around, and the walls are twinkling with the damp. There's a noise upstairs and when we go up we find Dad and Mam and the missing furniture. It's nice and warm there with a fire blazing in the grate, Mam sitting in the bed, and Dad reading The Irish Press and smoking a cigarette by the fire. Mam tells us there was a terrible flood, that the rain came down the lane and poured in under our door. They tried to stop it with rags but they only turned sopping wet and let the rain in. People emptying their buckets made it worse and there was a sickening stink in the kitchen. She thinks we should stay upstairs as long as there is rain. We'll be warm through the winter months and then we can go downstairs in the springtime if there is any sign of a dryness in the walls or the floor. Dad says it's like going away on our holidays to a warm foreign place like Italy. That's what we'll call the upstairs from now on, Italy. Malachy says the Pope is still on the wall downstairs and he's going to be all cold and couldn't we bring him up? but Mam says, No, he's going to stay where he is because I don't want him on the wall glaring at me in the bed. Isn't it enough that we dragged him all the way from Brooklyn to Belfast to Dublin to Limerick? All I want now is a little peace, ease and comfort....\nMam takes Malachy and me to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to stand in the queue and see if there's any chance of getting something for the Christmas dinner-a goose or a ham, but the man says everyone in\nLimerick is desperate this Christmas. He gives her a docket for groceries at McGrath's shop and another one for the butcher.\nNo goose, says the butcher, no ham. No fancy items when you bring the docket from the St. Vincent de Paul. What you can have now, missus, is black pudding and tripe or a sheep's head or a nice pig's head. No harm in a pig's head, missus, plenty of meat and children love it, slice that cheek, slather it with mustard and you're in heaven, though I suppose they wouldn't have the likes of that in America where they're mad for the steak and all classes of poultry, flying, walking or swimming itself.\nHe tells Mam, no, she can't have boiled bacon or sausages and if she has any sense she'll take the pig's head before they're all gone the way the poor people of Limerick are clamoring for them.\nMam says the pig's head isn't right for Christmas and he says 'tis more than the Holy Family had in that cold stable in Bethlehem long ago. You wouldn't find them complaining if someone offered them a nice fat pig's head.\nNo, they wouldn't complain, says Mam, but they'd never eat the pig's head. They were Jewish.\nAnd what does that have to do with it? A pig's head is a pig's head.\nAnd a Jew is a Jew and 'tis against their religion and I don't blame them.\nThe butcher says, Are you a bit of an expert, missus, on the Jews and the pig.\nI am not, says Mam, but there was a Jewish woman, Mrs. Leibowitz, in New York, and I don't know what we would have done without her.\nThe butcher takes the pig's head off a shelf and when Malachy says, Ooh, look at the dead dog, the butcher and Mam burst out laughing. He wraps the head in newspaper, hands it to Mam and says, Happy Christmas. Then he wraps up some sausages and tells her, Take these sausages for your breakfast on Christmas Day. Mam says, Oh, I can't afford sausages, and he says, Am I asking you for money? Am I? Take these sausages. They might help make up for the lack of a goose or a ham.\nSure, you don't have to do that, says Mam.\nI know that, missus. If I had to do it, I wouldn't.\nMam says she has a pain in her back, that I'll have to carry the\npig's head. I hold it against my chest but it's damp and when the newspaper begins to fall away everyone can see the head. Mam says, I'm ashamed of me life that the world should know we're having pig's head for Christmas. Boys from Leamy's National School see me and they point and laugh. Aw, Gawd, look at Frankie McCourt an'his pig's snout. Is that what the Yanks ate for Christmas dinner, Frankie?\nOne calls to another, Hey, Christy, do you know how to ate a pig's\nhead?\nNo, I don't, Paddy.\nGrab him by the ears an' chew the face offa him.\nAnd Christy says, Hey, Paddy, do you know the only part of the pig the McCourts don't ate?\nNo, I don't, Christy.\nThe only part they don't ate is the oink.\nAfter a few streets the newspaper is gone altogether and everyone\ncan see the pig's head. His nose is flat against my chest and pointing up at my chin and I feel sorry for him because he's dead and the world is\nlaughing at him. My sister and two brothers are dead, too, but if anyone laughed at them I'd hit them with a rock.\nI wish Dad would come and help us because Mam has to stop every few steps and lean against a wall. She's holding her back and telling us she'll never be able to climb Barrack Hill. Even if Dad came he wouldn't be much use because he never carries anything, parcels, bags, packages. If you carry such things you lose your dignity. That's what he says. He carried the twins when they were tired and he carried the Pope, but that was not the same as carrying ordinary things like a pig's head. He tells Malachy and me that when you grow up you have to wear a collar and tie and never let people see you carry things.\nHe's upstairs sitting by the fire, smoking a cigarette, reading The Irish Press, which he loves because it's De Valera's paper and he thinks De Valera is the greatest man in the world. He looks at me and the pig's head and tells Mam it's a disgraceful thing to let a boy carry an object like that through the streets of Limerick. She takes off her coat and eases herself into the bed and tells him that next Christmas he can go out and find the dinner. She's worn out and gasping for a cup of tea so would he drop his grand airs, boil the water for the tea and fry some bread before his two small sons starve to death.\nOn Christmas morning he lights the fire early so that we can have sausages and bread and tea. Mam sends me to Grandma to see if we can borrow a pot for the pig's head. Grandma says, What are ye having for yeer dinner? Pig's head! Jesus, Mary an' Joseph, that's goin' beyond the beyonds. Couldn't your father get out and find a ham or a goose at least? What kind of man is he at all, at all?\nMam puts the head in the pot, just covered with water, and while the pig is boiling away Dad takes Malachy and me to Mass at the Redemptorist church. It's warm in the church and sweet with flowers and incense and candles. He takes us to see the Baby Jesus in the crib. He's a big fat baby with fair curls like Malachy. Dad tells us that's Jesus' mother there, Mary, in the blue dress, and his father, St. Joseph, the old man with the beard. He says they're sad because they know Jesus will grow up and be killed so that we can all go to heaven. I ask why the Baby Jesus has to die and Dad says you can't ask questions like that. Malachy says, Why? and Dad tells him be quiet.\nMam is in a terrible state at home. There isn't enough coal to cook the dinner, the water isn't boiling anymore and she says she's demented with worry. We'll have to go down the Dock Road again to see if there's any coal or turf lying around from the lorries. Surely we'll find something on the road this day of all days. Even the poorest of the poor don't go out on Christmas Day picking coal off the road. There's no use asking Dad to go because he will never stoop that low and even if he did he won't carry things through the streets. It's a rule he has. Mam can't go because of the pain in her back.\nShe says, You'll have to go, Frank, and take Malachy with you.\nIt's a long way to the Dock Road but we don't mind because our bellies are filled with sausages and bread and it's not raining. We carry a canvas bag Mam borrowed from Mrs. Hannon next door and Mam is right, there is no one on the Dock Road. The poor are all at home having pig's head or maybe a goose and we have the Dock Road to ourselves. We find bits of coal and turf stuck in cracks on the road and in the walls of the coal yards. We find bits of paper and cardboard that will be useful in starting the fire again. We're wandering around trying to fill the bag\nwhen Pa Keating comes along. He must have washed himself for Christmas because he's not as black as he was when Eugene died. He wants to know what we're doing with that bag and when Malachy tells him he says, Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! Christmas Day and ye don't have a fire for yeer pig's head. That's a bloody disgrace.\nHe takes us to South's pub, which is not supposed to be open, but he's a regular customer and there's a back door for men who want their pint to celebrate the birthday of the Baby Jesus above in the crib. He orders his pint and lemonade for us and asks the man if there's any chance of getting a few lumps of coal. The man says he's been serving drink for twenty-seven years and nobody ever asked him for coal before. Pa says it would be a favor and the man says if Pa asked for the moon he'd fly up and bring it back. The man leads us to the coal hole under the stairs and tells us take what we can carry. It's real coal and not bits from the Dock Road and if we can't carry it we can drag it along the ground.\nIt takes us a long time to go from South's pub to Barrack Hill because of a hole in the bag. I pull the bag and it's Malachy's job to pick up the lumps that fall through the hole and put them back again. Then it starts to rain and we can't stand in a doorway till it passes because we have that coal and it's leaving a black trail along the pavement and Malachy is turning black from picking up the lumps, pushing them into the bag and wiping the rain from his face with his wet black hands. I tell him he's black, he tells me I'm black, and a woman in a shop tells us get away from that door, 'tis Christmas Day and she doesn't want to be looking at Africa.\nWe have to keep dragging the bag or we'll never have our Christmas dinner. It will take ages to get a fire going and ages more to get our dinner because the water has to be boiling when Mam puts in the head of cabbage and the potatoes to keep the pig company in the pot. We drag the bag up O'Connell Avenue and we see people in their houses sitting around tables with all kinds of decorations and bright lights. At one house they push up the window and the children point and laugh and call to us, Look at the Zulus. Where are yeer spears?\nMalachy makes faces at them and wants to throw coal at them but I tell him if he throws coal there's less for the pig and we'll never get our dinner.\nThe downstairs in our house is a lake again from the rain pouring under the door but it doesn't matter because we're drenched anyway and we can wade through the water. Dad comes down and drags the bag upstairs to Italy. He says we're good boys for getting so much coal, that the Dock Road must have been covered with it. When Mam sees us she starts to laugh, and then she cries. She's laughing because we're so black and crying because we're sopping wet. She tells us take off all our clothes and she washes the coal off our hands and faces. She tells Dad the pig's head can wait a while so that we can have a jam jar of hot tea.\nIt's raining outside and there's a lake downstairs in our kitchen but up here in Italy the fire is going again and the room is so dry and warm that, after our tea, Malachy and I doze off in the bed and we don't wake till Dad tells us the dinner is ready. Our clothes are still wet, so Malachy sits on the trunk at the table wrapped in Mam's red American overcoat and I'm wrapped in an old coat that Mam's father left behind when he went to Australia.\nThere are delicious smells in the room, cabbage, potatoes, and the pig's head, but when Dad lifts the head from the pot to a plate Malachy says, Oh, the poor pig. I don't want to eat the poor pig.\nMam says, If you were hungry you'd eat it. Now stop the nonsense and eat your dinner.\nDad says, Wait a minute. He takes slices from the two cheeks, places them on our plates and smears them with mustard. He takes the plate that holds the pig's head and puts it on the floor under the table. Now, he says to Malachy, that's ham, and Malachy eats it because he's not looking at what it came from and it isn't pig's head anymore. The cabbage is soft and hot and there are plenty of potatoes with butter and salt. Mam peels our potatoes but Dad eats his skin and all. He says all the nourishment of a potato is in the skin and Mam says it's a good thing he's not eating eggs, he'd be chewing the shells and all.\nHe says he would, and it's a disgrace that the Irish throw out millions of potato skins every day and that's why thousands are dying of consumption and surely there's nourishment in the shell of an egg since waste is the eighth deadly sin. If he had his way, and Mam says, Never mind your way. Eat your dinner.\nHe eats half a potato with its skin on and puts the other half back in the pot. He eats a small slice of the pig's cheek and a leaf of cabbage and leaves the rest on his plate for Malachy and me. He makes more tea and we have that with bread and jam so that no one can say we didn't have a sweet on Christmas Day.\nIt's dark now and still raining outside and the coal is glowing in the grate where Mam and Dad sit and smoke their cigarettes. There's nothing to do when your clothes are wet but get back into bed where it's cozy and your father can tell you a story about how Cuchulain became a Catholic and you fall asleep and dream about the pig standing in the crib at the Redemptorist church crying because he and the Baby Jesus and Cuchulain all have to grow up and die.\nThe angel that brought Margaret and the twins comes again and brings us another brother, Michael. Dad says he found Michael on the seventh step of the stairs to Italy. He says that's what you have to watch for when you ask for a new baby, the Angel on the Seventh Step.\nMalachy wants to know how you can get a new brother from the Angel on the Seventh Step if you don't have any stairs in your house and Dad tells him that asking too many questions is an affliction.\nMalachy wants to know what an affliction is.\nAffliction. I'd like to know what that word means. Affliction, but Dad says, Och, child, the world is an affliction and everything in it, puts on his cap and goes to the Bedford Row Hospital to see Mam and Michael. She's in the hospital with the pain in her back and she has the baby with her to make sure he was healthy when he was left on the seventh step. I don't understand this because I'm sure angels would never leave a sick baby on the seventh step. There's no use asking Dad or Mam about this. They say, You're getting as bad as your brother for asking questions. Go play.\nI know that big people don't like questions from children. They can ask all the questions they like, How's school? Are you a good boy? Did you say your prayers? but if you ask them did they say their prayers you might be hit on the head.\nDad brings Mam home with the new baby and she has to stay in bed for a few days with the pain in her back. She says this baby is the\nspitting image of our sister who died, with his wavy black hair, his lovely blue eyes, and the gorgeous eyebrows. That's what Mam says.\nI want to know if the baby will be spitting. I also want to know which is the seventh step because there are nine steps on the stairs and I'd like to know if you count from the bottom or the top. Dad doesn't mind answering this question. Angels come down from above, he says, and not up from kitchens like ours which are lakes from October till April.\nSo I find the seventh step by counting from the top.\nThe baby Michael has a cold. His head is stuffed and he can barely breathe. Mam worries because it's Sunday and the Dispensary for the poor is closed. If you go to the doctor's house and the maid sees you're from the lower classes she tells you go to the Dispensary where you belong. If you tell her the child is dying in your arms she'll say the doctor is in the country riding his horse.\nMam cries because the baby is struggling to get air through his mouth. She tries to clear his nostrils with a bit of rolled up paper but she's afraid to push it too far up. Dad says, There's no need for that. You're not supposed to be pushing things inside a child's head. It looks like he's going to kiss the baby. Instead, he has his mouth on the little nose and he's sucking sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head. He spits it into the fire, Michael gives out a loud cry and you can see him drawing the air into his head and kicking his legs and laughing. Mam looks at Dad as if he just came down from heaven and Dad says, That's what we did in Antrim long before there were doctors riding their horses.\nMichael entitles us to a few extra shillings on the dole but Mam says it isn't enough and now she has to go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society for food. One night there is a knock on the door and Mam sends me down to see who it is. There are two men from the St. Vincent de Paul and they want to see my mother and father. I tell them my parents are upstairs in Italy and they say, What?\nUpstairs where 'tis dry. I'll tell them.\nThey want to know what that little shed is beside our front door. I tell them it's the lavatory. They want to know why it isn't in the back of the house and I tell them it's the lavatory for the whole lane and it's a good thing it's not in the back of our house or we'd have people traipsing through our kitchen with buckets that would make you sick.\nThey say, Are you sure there's one lavatory for the whole lane? I am.\nThey say, Mother of God.\nMam calls down from Italy. Who's down there?\nThe men.\nWhat men? From the St. Vincent de Paul.\nThey're careful the way they step into the lake in the kitchen and\nthey make tsk tsk and tut tut noises and they tell one another, Isn't this a disgrace? till they get upstairs to Italy. They tell Mam and Dad they're sorry to disturb them but the Society has to be sure they're helping deserving cases. Mam offers them a cup of tea but they look around and say, No, thank you. They want to know why we're living upstairs. They want to know about the lavatory. They ask questions because big people can ask all the questions they like and write in notebooks, especially when they're wearing collars and ties and suits. They ask how old Michael is, how much Dad gets at the Labour Exchange, when did he last have a job, why doesn't he have a job now and what class of an accent is that he has?\nDad tells them the lavatory could kill us with every class of disease, that the kitchen floods in the winter and we have to move upstairs to stay dry. He says the River Shannon is responsible for all the dampness in the world and killing us one by one.\nMalachy tells them we're living in Italy and they smile.\nMam asks if there's any chance of getting boots for Malachy and me and they say she'll have to come down to Ozanam House and apply. She says she hasn't been feeling well since the baby came and she wouldn't be able to stand long in a queue, but they say everyone has to be treated the same, even a woman down in the Irishtown that had triplets and, thank you, we'll make our report to the Society.\nWhen they're leaving Malachy wants to show them where the angel left Michael on the seventh step but Dad tells him, Not now, not now. Malachy cries and one of the men gives him a piece of toffee from his pocket and I wish I had something to cry about so that I'd get a piece, too.\nI have to go downstairs again and show the men where to step to keep their feet dry. They keep shaking their heads and saying, God Almighty and Mother of God, this is desperate. That's not Italy they have upstairs, that's Calcutta.\nDad is telling Mam up in Italy she should never beg like that. What do you mean, beg?\nDon't you have any pride, begging for boots like that?\nAnd what would you do, Mr. Grand Manner? Would you let them go\nbarefoot?\nI'd rather fix the shoes they have.\nThe shoes they have are falling to pieces.\nI can fix them, he says.\nYou can't fix anything. You're useless, she says.\nHe comes home the next day with an old bicycle tire. He sends me to\nMr. Hannon next door for the loan of a last and a hammer. He takes Mam's sharp knife and he hacks at the tire till he has pieces to fit on the soles and heels of our shoes. Mam tells him he's going to destroy the shoes altogether but he pounds away with the hammer, driving the nails through the rubber pieces and into the shoes. Mam says, God above, if you left the shoes alone they'd last till Easter, at least, and we might get the boots from the St. Vincent de Paul. But he won't stop till the soles and heels are covered with squares of rubber tire which stick out on each side of the shoe and flop before and behind. He makes us put on the shoes and tells us our feet will be good and warm but we don't want to wear them anymore because the tire pieces are so lumpy we stumble when we walk around Italy. He sends me back to Mr. Hannon with the last and hammer and Mrs. Hannon says, God above, what's up with your shoes? She laughs and Mr. Hannon shakes his head and I feel ashamed. I don't want to go to school next day and I pretend to be sick but Dad gets us up and gives us our fried bread and tea and tells us we should be grateful we have any shoes at all, that there are boys in Leamy's National School who go to school barefoot on bitter days. On our way to school Leamy's boys laugh at us because the tire pieces are so thick they add a few inches to our height and the boys say, How's the air up there? There are six or seven barefoot boys in my class and they don't say anything and I wonder if it's better to have shoes with rubber tires that make you trip and stumble or to go barefoot. If you have no shoes at all you'll have all the barefoot boys on your side. If you have rubber tires on your shoes\nyou're all alone with your brother and you have to fight your own battles. I sit on a bench in the schoolyard shed and take off my shoes and stockings but when I go into the class the master wants to know where my shoes are. He knows I'm not one of the barefoot boys and he makes me go back to the yard, bring in the shoes and put them on. Then he says to the class, There is sneering here. There is jeering at the misfortunes of others. Is there anyone in this class that thinks he's perfect? Raise your hands.\nThere are no hands. Is there anyone in this class that comes from a rich family with money galore to spend on shoes? Raise your hands.\nThere are no hands.\nHe says, There are boys here who have to mend their shoes whatever way they can. There are boys in this class with no shoes at all. It's not their fault and it's no shame. Our Lord had no shoes. He died shoeless. Do you see Him hanging on the cross sporting shoes? Do you, boys?\nNo, sir.\nWhat is it you don't see Our Lord doing?\nHanging on the cross and sporting shoes, sir.\nNow if I hear of one boy in this class jeering and sneering at\nMcCourt or his brother over their\nwill come out, boys?\nThe stick, sir.\nThe stick will sting, boys.\nair, it will land on the backside\nsneers. Where will it land, boys?\nshoes the stick will come out. What\nThe ash plant will whistle through the\nof the boy that jeers, the boy that\nOn the boy that jeers, sir.\nAnd?\nThe boy that sneers, sir.\nThe boys bother us no more and we wear our shoes with the rubber\ntires the few weeks to Easter when the St. Vincent de Paul Society gives us the gift of boots.\nIf I have to get up in the middle of the night to pee in the bucket I go to the top of the stairs and look down to see if the angel might be on the seventh step. Sometimes I'm sure there's a light there and if everyone's asleep I sit on the step in case the angel might be bringing another baby or just coming for a visit. I ask Mam if the angel just brings the babies and then forgets about them. She says, Of course not. The angel never forgets the babies and comes back to make sure the baby is happy.\nI could ask the angel all kinds of questions and I'm sure he'd answer, unless it's a girl angel. But I'm sure a girl angel would answer questions, too. I never heard anyone say they didn't.\nI sit on the seventh step a long time and I'm sure the angel is there. I tell him all the things you can't tell your mother or father for fear of being hit on the head or told go out and play. I tell him all about school and how I'm afraid of the master and his stick when he roars at us in Irish and I still don't know what he's talking about because I came from America and the other boys were learning Irish a year before me.\nI stay on the seventh step till it gets too cold or Dad gets up and tells me go back to bed. He's the one who told me the angel comes to the seventh step in the first place and you'd think he'd know why I'm sitting there. I told him one night that I was waiting for the angel, and he said, Och, now, Francis, you're a bit of a dreamer.\nI get back into bed but I can hear him whisper to my mother. The poor wee lad was sitting on the stairs talking away to an angel.\nHe laughs and my mother laughs and I think, Isn't it curious the way big people laugh over the angel who brought them a new child.\nBefore Easter we move back downstairs to Ireland. Easter is better than Christmas because the air is warmer, the walls are not dripping with the damp, and the kitchen isn't a lake anymore, and if we're up early we might catch the sun slanting for a minute through the kitchen window.\nIn fine weather men sit outside smoking their cigarettes if they have them, looking at the world and watching us play. Women stand with their arms folded, chatting. They don't sit because all they do is stay at home, take care of the children, clean the house and cook a bit and the men need the chairs. The men sit because they're worn out from walking to the Labour Exchange every morning to sign for the dole, discussing the world's problems and wondering what to do with the rest of the day. Some stop at the bookie to study the form and place a shilling or two on a sure thing. Some spend hours in the Carnegie Library reading English and Irish newspapers. A man on the dole needs to keep up with things because all the other men on the dole are experts on what's going on in the world. A man on the dole must be ready in case another man on the dole brings up Hitler or Mussolini or the terrible state of the Chinese millions. A man on the dole goes home after a day with the bookie or the newspaper and his wife will not begrudge him a few minutes with the ease and peace of his cigarette and his tea and time to sit in his chair and think of the world.\nEaster is better than Christmas because Dad takes us to the Redemptorist church where all the priests wear white and sing. They're happy because Our Lord is in heaven. I ask Dad if the baby in the crib is dead and he says, No, He was thirty-three when He died and there He is, hanging on the cross. I don't understand how He grew up so fast that He's hanging there with a hat made of thorns and blood everywhere, dripping from His head, His hands, His feet, and a big hole near His belly.\nDad says I'll understand when I grow up. He tells me that all the time now and I want to be big like him so that I can understand everything. It must be lovely to wake up in the morning and understand everything. I wish I could be like all the big people in the church, standing and kneeling and praying and understanding everything.\nAt the Mass people go up to the altar and the priest puts something into their mouths. They come back to their seats with their heads down, their mouths moving. Malachy says he's hungry and he wants some, too. Dad says, Shush, that's Holy Communion, the body and blood of Our Lord.\nBut, Dad.\nShush, it's a mystery.\nThere's no use asking more questions. If you ask a question they\ntell you it's a mystery, you'll understand when you grow up, be a good boy, ask your mother, ask your father, for the love o' Jesus leave me alone, go out and play.\nDad gets his first job in Limerick at the cement factory and Mam is happy. She won't have to stand in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society asking for clothes and boots for Malachy and me. She says it's not begging, it's charity, but Dad says it's begging and shameful. Mam says she can now pay off the few pounds she owes at Kathleen O'Connell's shop and she can pay back what she owes her own mother. She hates to be under obligation to anyone, especially her own mother.\nThe cement factory is miles outside Limerick and that means Dad has to be out of the house by six in the morning. He doesn't mind because he's used to the long walks. The night before Mam makes him a flask of tea, a sandwich, a hard-boiled egg. She feels sorry for him the way he has to walk three miles out and three miles back. A bicycle would be handy but you'd have to be working a year for the price of it.\nFriday is payday and Mam is out of the bed early, cleaning the house and singing.\nAnyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this...\nThere isn't much to clean in the house. She sweeps the kitchen floor and the floor of Italy upstairs. She washes the four jam jars we use for mugs. She says if Dad's job lasts we'll get proper cups and maybe saucers and some day, with the help of God and His Blessed Mother, we'll have sheets on the bed and if we save a long time a blanket or two instead of those old coats which people must have left behind during the Great Famine. She boils water and washes the rags that keep Michael from shitting all over the pram and the house itself. Oh, she says, we'll have a lovely tea when your Pop brings home the wages tonight.\nPop. She's in a good mood.\nSirens and whistles go off all over the city when the men finish work at half-past five. Malachy and I are excited because we know that when your father works and brings home the wages you get the Friday Penny. We know this from other boys whose fathers work and we know that after your tea you can go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and buy sweets. If your mother is in a good mood she might even give you tuppence to go to the Lyric Cinema the next day to see a film with James Cagney.\nThe men who work in factories and shops in the city are coming into the lanes to have their supper, wash themselves and go to the pub. The women go to the films at the Coliseum or the Lyric Cinema. They buy sweets and Wild Woodbine cigarettes and if their husbands are working a long time they treat themselves to boxes of Black Magic chocolates. They love the romance films and they have a great time crying their eyes out when there's an unhappy ending or a handsome lover goes away to be shot by Hindus and other non-Catholics.\nWe have to wait a long time for Dad to walk the miles from the cement factory. We can't have our tea till he's home and that's very hard because you smell the cooking of other families in the lane. Mam says it's a good thing payday is Friday when you can't eat meat because the smell of bacon or sausages in other houses would drive her out of her mind. We can still have bread and cheese and a nice jam jar of tea with lashings of milk and sugar and what more do you want?\nThe women are gone to the cinemas, the men are in the pubs, and still Dad isn't home. Mam says it's a long way to the cement factory even if he's a fast walker. She says that but her eyes are watery and she's not singing anymore. She's sitting by the fire smoking a Wild Woodbine she got on credit from Kathleen O'Connell. The fag is the only luxury she has and she'll never forget Kathleen for her goodness. She doesn't know how long she can keep the water boiling in this kettle. There's no use making the tea till Dad gets home because it will be stewed, coddled, boiled and unfit to drink. Malachy says he's hungry and she gives him a piece of bread and cheese to keep him going. She says, This job could be\nthe saving of us. 'Tis hard enough for him to get a job with his northern accent and if he loses this one I don't know what we're going to do.\nThe darkness is in the lane and we have to light a candle. She has to give us our tea and bread and cheese because we're so hungry we can't wait another minute. She sits at the table, eats a bit of bread and cheese, smokes her Wild Woodbine. She goes to the door to see if Dad is coming down the lane and she talks about the paydays when we searched for him all over Brooklyn. She says, Some day we'll all go back to America and we'll have a nice warm place to live and a lavatory down the hall like the one in Classon Avenue and not this filthy thing outside our door.\nThe women are coming home from the cinemas, laughing, and the men, singing, from the pubs. Mam says there's no use waiting up any longer. If Dad stays in the pubs till closing time there will be nothing left from his wages and we might as well go to bed. She lies in her bed with Michael in her arms. It's quiet in the lane and I can hear her crying even though she pulls an old coat over her face and I can hear in the distance, my father.\nI know it's my father because he's the only one in Limerick who sings that song from the North, Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today. He comes round the corner at the top of the lane and starts Kevin Barry. He sings a verse, stops, holds on to a wall, cries over Kevin Barry. People stick their heads out windows and doors and tell him, For Jasus' sake, put a sock in it. Some of us have to get up in the morning for work. Go home and sing your feckin' patriotic songs.\nHe stands in the middle of the lane and tells the world to step outside, he's ready to fight, ready to fight and die for Ireland, which is more than he can say for the men of Limerick, who are known the length and breadth of the world for collaborating with the perfidious Saxons.\nHe's pushing in our door and singing,\nAnd if, when all a vigil keep,\nThe West's asleep, the West's asleep! Alas! and well my Erin weep,\nThat Connacht lies in slumber deep,\nBut hark! a voice like thunder spake 'The West's awake! the West's awake! Sing, Oh, hurrah, let England quake, We'll watch till death for Erin's sake!'\nHe calls from the bottom of the stairs, Angela, Angela, is there a drop of tea in this house?\nShe doesn't answer and he calls again, Francis, Malachy, come down here, boys. I have the Friday Penny for you.\nI want to go down and get the Friday Penny but Mam is sobbing with the coat over her mouth and Malachy says, I don't want his old Friday Penny. He can keep it.\nDad is stumbling up the stairs, making a speech about how we all have to die for Ireland. He lights a match and touches it to the candle by Mam's bed. He holds the candle over his head and marches around the room, singing, See who comes over the red-blossomed heather, Their green banners kissing the pure mountain air, Heads erect, eyes to front,\nstepping proudly together, Sure freedom sits throned on each proud spirit there.\nMichael wakes and lets out a loud cry, the Hannons are banging on the wall next door, Mam is telling Dad he's a disgrace and why doesn't he get out of the house altogether.\nHe stands in the middle of the floor with the candle over his head. He pulls a penny from his pocket and waves it to Malachy and me. Your Friday Penny, boys, he says. I want you to jump out of that bed and line up here like two soldiers and promise to die for Ireland and I'll give the two of you the Friday Penny.\nMalachy sits up in the bed. I don't want it, he says.\nAnd I tell him I don't want it, either.\nDad stands for a minute, swaying, and puts the penny back in his\npocket. He turns toward Mam and she says, You're not sleeping in this bed tonight. He makes his way downstairs with the candle, sleeps on a chair, misses work in the morning, loses the job at the cement factory, and we're back on the dole again.\nIV\nThe master says it's time to prepare for First Confession and First Communion, to know and remember all the questions and answers in the catechism, to become good Catholics, to know the difference between right and wrong, to die for the Faith if called on.\nThe master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says, Och, Angela, puts on his cap and goes for a long walk.\nThe master says we're each to bring threepence for the First Communion catechism with the green cover. The catechism has all the questions and answers we have to know by heart before we can receive First Communion. Older boys in the fifth class have the thick Confirmation catechism with the red cover and that costs sixpence. I'd love to be big and important and parade around with the red Confirmation catechism but I don't think I'll live that long the way I'm expected to die for this or that. I want to ask why there are so many big people who haven't died for Ireland or the Faith but I know if you ask a question like that you get you the thump on the head or you're told go out and play.\nIt's very handy to have Mikey Molloy living around the corner from me. He's eleven, he has fits and behind his back we call him Molloy the Fit. People in the lane say the fit is an affliction and now I know what affliction means. Mikey knows everything because he has visions in his fits and he reads books. He's the expert in the lane on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General and he promises, I'll tell you everything, Frankie, when you're eleven like me and you're not so thick and ignorant.\nIt's a good thing he says Frankie so I'll know he's talking to me because he has crossed eyes and you never know who he's looking at. If he's talking to Malachy and I think he's talking to me he might go into a\nrage and have a fit that will carry him off. He says it's a gift to have crossed eyes because you're like a god looking two ways at once and if you had crossed eyes in the ancient Roman times you had no problem getting a good job. If you look at pictures of Roman emperors you'll see there's always a great hint of crossed eyes. When he's not having the fit he sits on the ground at the top of the lane reading the books his father brings home from the Carnegie Library. His mother says books books books, he's ruining his eyes with the reading, he needs an operation to straighten them but who'll pay for it. She tells him if he keeps on straining his eyes they'll float together till he has one eye in the middle of his head. Ever after his father calls him Cyclops, who is in a Greek story.\nNora Molloy knows my mother from the queues at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. She tells Mam that Mikey has more sense than twelve men drinking pints in a pub. He knows the names of all the Popes from St. Peter to Pius the Eleventh. He's only eleven but he's a man, oh, a man indeed. Many a week he saves the family from pure starvation. He borrows a handcart from Aidan Farrell and knocks on doors all over Limerick to see if there are people who want coal or turf delivered, and down the Dock Road he'll go to haul back great bags a hundredweight or more. He'll run messages for old people who can't walk and if they don't have a penny to give him a prayer will do.\nIf he earns a little money he hands it over to his mother, who loves her Mikey. He is her world, her heart's blood, her pulse, and if anything ever happened to him they might as well stick her in the lunatic asylum and throw away the key.\nMikey's father, Peter, is a great champion. He wins bets in the pubs by drinking more pints than anyone. All he has to do is go out to the jakes, stick his finger down his throat and bring it all up so that he can start another round. Peter is such a champion he can stand in the jakes and throw up without using his finger. He's such a champion they could chop off his fingers and he'd carry on regardless. He wins all that money but doesn't bring it home. Sometimes he's like my father and drinks the dole itself and that's why Nora Molloy is often carted off to the lunatic asylum demented with worry over her hungry famishing family. She knows as long as you're in the asylum you're safe from the world and its torments, there's nothing you can do, you're protected, and what's the use of worrying. It's well known that all the lunatics in the asylum have to be dragged in but she's the only one that has to be dragged out, back to her five children and the champion of all pint drinkers.\nYou can tell when Nora Molloy is ready for the asylum when you see her children running around white with flour from poll to toe. That happens when Peter drinks the dole money and leaves her desperate and she knows the men will come to take her away. You know she's inside frantic with the baking. She wants to make sure the children won't starve while she's gone and she roams Limerick begging for flour. She goes to priests, nuns, Protestants, Quakers. She goes to Rank's Flour Mills and begs for the sweepings from the floor. She bakes day and night. Peter begs her to stop but she screams, This is what comes of drinking the dole. He tells her the bread will only go stale. There's no use talking to her. Bake bake bake. If she had the money she'd bake all the flour in Limerick and regions beyond. If the men didn't come from the lunatic asylum to take her away she'd bake till she fell to the floor.\nThe children stuff themselves with so much bread people in the lane say they're looking like loaves. Still the bread goes stale and Mikey is so bothered by the waste he talks to a rich woman with a cookbook and she tells him make bread pudding. He boils the hard bread in water and sour milk and throws in a cup of sugar and his brother loves it even if that's all they have the fortnight their mother is in the lunatic asylum.\nMy father says, Do they take her away because she's gone mad baking bread or does she go mad baking bread because they're taking her away?\nNora comes home calm as if she had been at the seaside. She always says, Where's Mikey? Is he alive? She worries over Mikey because he's not a proper Catholic and if he had a fit and died who knows where he might wind up in the next life. He's not a proper Catholic because he could never receive his First Communion for fear of getting anything on his tongue that might cause a fit and choke him. The master tried over and over with bits of the Limerick Leader but Mikey kept spitting them out till the master got into a state and sent him to the priest, who wrote to the bishop, who said, Don't bother me, handle it yourself. The master sent a note home saying Mikey was to practice receiving Communion with his father or mother but even they couldn't get him to swallow a piece of the Limerick Leader in the shape of a wafer. They even tried a piece of bread shaped like the wafer with bread and jam and it was no use. The priest tells Mrs. Molloy not to worry. God moves in mysterious ways His wonders to perform and surely He has a special purpose for Mikey, fits and all. She says, Isn't it remarkable he can swally all kinds of sweets and buns but if he has to swally the body of Our Lord he goes into a fit? Isn't that remarkable? She worries Mikey might have the fit and die and go to hell if he has any class of a sin on his soul though everyone knows he's an angel out of heaven. Mikey tells her God is not going to afflict you with the fit and then boot you into hell on top of it. What kind of a God would do a thing like that?\nAre you sure, Mikey?\nI am. I read it in a book.\nHe sits under the lamppost at the top of the lane and laughs over\nhis First Communion day, which was all a cod. He couldn't swallow the wafer but did that stop his mother from parading him around Limerick in his little black suit for The Collection? She said to Mikey, Well, I'm not lying so I'm not. I'm only saying to the neighbors, Here's Mikey in his First Communion suit. That's all I'm saying, mind you. Here's Mikey. If they think you swallied your First Communion who am I to contradict them and disappoint them? Mikey's father said, Don't worry, Cyclops. You have loads of time. Jesus didn't become a proper Catholic till he took the bread and wine at the Last Supper and He was thirty-three years of age. Nora Molloy said, Will you stop calling him Cyclops? He has two eyes in his head and he's not a Greek. But Mikey's father, champion of all pint drinkers, is like my uncle Pa Keating, he doesn't give a fiddler's fart what the world says and that's the way I'd like to be myself.\nMikey tells me the best thing about First Communion is The Collection. Your mother has to get you a new suit somehow so she can show you off to the neighbors and relations and they give you sweets and money and you can go to the Lyric Cinema to see Charlie Chaplin.\nWhat about James Cagney?\nNever mind James Cagney. Lots of blather. Charlie Chaplin is your only man. But you have to be with your mother on The Collection. The grown-up people of Limerick are not going to be handing out money to\nevery little Tom Dick and Mick with a First Communion suit that doesn't have his mother with him.\nMikey got over five shillings on his First Communion day and ate so many sweets and buns he threw up in the Lyric Cinema and Frank Goggin, the ticket man, kicked him out. He says he didn't care because he had money left over and went to the Savoy Cinema the same day for a pirate film and ate Cadbury chocolate and drank lemonade till his stomach stuck out a mile. He can't wait for Confirmation day because you're older, there's another collection and that brings more money than First Communion. He'll go to the cinema the rest of his life, sit next to girls from lanes and do dirty things like an expert. He loves his mother but he'll never get married for fear he might have a wife in and out of the lunatic asylum. What's the use of getting married when you can sit in cinemas and do dirty things with girls from lanes who don't care what they do because they already did it with their brothers. If you don't get married you won't have any children at home bawling for tea and bread and gasping with the fit and looking in every direction with their eyes. When he's older he'll go to the pub like his father, drink pints galore, stick the finger down the throat to bring it all up, drink more pints, win the bets and bring the money home to his mother to keep her from going demented.\nHe says he's not a proper Catholic which means he's doomed so he can do anything he bloody well likes. He says, I'll tell you more when you grow up, Frankie. You're too young now and you don't know your arse from your elbow.\nThe master, Mr. Benson, is very old. He roars and spits all over us every day. The boys in the front row hope he has no diseases for it's the spit that carries all the diseases and he might be spreading consumption right and left. He tells us we have to know the catechism backwards, forwards and sideways. We have to know the Ten Commandments, the Seven Virtues, Divine and Moral, the Seven Sacraments, the Seven Deadly Sins. We have to know by heart all the prayers, the Hail Mary, the Our Father, the Confiteor, the Apostles' Creed, the Act of Contrition, the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary. We have to know them in Irish and English and if we forget an Irish word and use English he goes into a rage and goes at us with the stick. If he had his way we'd be learning our religion in Latin, the language of the saints who communed intimately with God and His Holy Mother, the language of the early Christians, who huddled in the catacombs and went forth to die on rack and sword, who expired in the foaming jaws of the ravenous lion. Irish is fine for patriots, English for traitors and informers, but it's the Latin that gains us entrance to heaven itself. It's the Latin the martyrs prayed in when the barbarians pulled out their nails and cut their skin off inch by inch. He tells us we're a disgrace to Ireland and her long sad history, that we'd be better off in Africa praying to bush or tree. He tells us we're hopeless, the worst class he ever had for First Communion but as sure as God made little apples he'll make Catholics of us, he'll beat the idler out of us and the Sanctifying Grace into us.\nBrendan Quigley raises his hand. We call him Question Quigley because he's always asking questions. He can't help himself. Sir, he says, what's Sanctifying Grace?\nThe master rolls his eyes to heaven. He's going to kill Quigley. Instead he barks at him, Never mind what's Sanctifying Grace, Quigley. That's none of your business. You're here to learn the catechism and do\nwhat you're told. You're not here to be asking questions. There are too many people wandering the world asking questions and that's what has us in the state we're in and if I find any boy in this class asking questions I won't be responsible for what happens. Do you hear me, Quigley?\nI do.\nI do what?\nI do, sir.\nHe goes on with his speech, There are boys in this class who will\nnever know the Sanctifying Grace. And why? Because of the greed. I have heard them abroad in the schoolyard talking about First Communion day, the happiest day of your life. Are they talking about receiving the body and blood of Our Lord? Oh, no. Those greedy little blaguards are talking about the money they'll get, The Collection. They'll go from house to house in their little suits like beggars for The Collection. And will they take any of that money and send it to the little black babies in Africa? Will they think of those little pagans doomed forever for lack of baptism and knowledge of the True Faith? Little black babies denied knowledge of the Mystical Body of Christ? Limbo is packed with little black babies flying around and crying for their mothers because they'll never be admitted to the ineffable presence of Our Lord and the glorious company of saints, martyrs, virgins. Oh, no. It's off to the cinemas, our First Communion boys run to wallow in the filth spewed across the world by the devil's henchmen in Hollywood. Isn't that right, McCourt?\n'Tis, sir.\nQuestion Quigley raises his hand again. There are looks around the room and we wonder if it's suicide he's after.\nWhat's henchmen, sir?\nThe master's face goes white, then red. His mouth tightens and opens and spit flies everywhere. He walks to Question and drags him from his seat. He snorts and stutters and his spit flies around the room. He flogs Question across the shoulders, the bottom, the legs. He grabs him by the collar and drags him to the front of the room.\nLook at this specimen, he roars.\nQuestion is shaking and crying. I'm sorry, sir.\nThe master mocks him. I'm sorry, sir. What are you sorry for? I'm sorry I asked the question. I'll never ask a question again,\nsir.\nThe day you do, Quigley, will be the day you wish God would take\nyou to His bosom. What will you wish, Quigley?\nThat God will take me to His bosom, sir.\nGo back to your seat, you omadhaun, you poltroon, you thing from\nthe far dark corner of a bog.\nHe sits down with the stick before him on the desk. He tells\nQuestion to stop the whimpering and be a man. If he hears a single boy in this class asking foolish questions or talking about The Collection again he'll flog that boy till the blood spurts.\nwhat?\nWhat will I do, boys?\nFlog the boy, sir.\nTill?\nTill the blood spurts, sir.\nNow, Clohessy, what is the Sixth Commandment?\nThou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not commit adultery\nThou shalt not commit adultery, sir.\nAnd what is adultery, Clohessy?\nImpure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, sir.\nGood, Clohessy. You're a good boy. You may be slow and forgetful in\nthe sir department and you may not have a shoe to your foot but you're powerful with the Sixth Commandment and that will keep you pure.\nPaddy Clohessy has no shoe to his foot, his mother shaves his head to keep the lice away, his eyes are red, his nose always snotty. The sores on his kneecaps never heal because he picks at the scabs and puts them in his mouth. His clothes are rags he has to share with his six brothers and a sister and when he comes to school with a bloody nose or a black eye you know he had a fight over the clothes that morning. He hates school. He's seven going on eight, the biggest and oldest boy in the class, and he can't wait to grow up and be fourteen so that he can run away and pass for seventeen and join the English army and go to India where it's nice and warm and he'll live in a tent with a dark girl with the red dot on her forehead and he'll be lying there eating figs, that's what they eat in India, figs, and she'll cook the curry day and night and plonk on a ukulele and when he has enough money he'll send for the whole family and they'll all live in the tent especially his poor father who's at home coughing up great gobs of blood because of the consumption. When my mother sees Paddy on the street she says, Wisha, look at that poor child. He's a skeleton with rags and if they were making a film about the famine he'd surely be put in the middle of it.\nI think Paddy likes me because of the raisin and I feel a bit guilty because I wasn't that generous in the first place. The master, Mr. Benson, said the government was going to give us the free lunch so we wouldn't have to be going home in the freezing weather. He led us down to a cold room in the dungeons of Leamy's School where the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, was handing out the half pint of milk and the raisin bun. The milk was frozen in the bottles and we had to melt it between our thighs. The boys joked and said the bottles would freeze our things off and the master roared, Any more of that talk and I'll warm the bottles on the backs of yeer heads. We all searched our raisin buns for a raisin but Nellie said they must have forgotten to put them in and she'd inquire from the man who delivered. We searched again every day till at last I found a raisin in my bun and held it up. The boys started grousing and said they wanted a raisin and Nellie said it wasn't her fault. She'd ask the man again. Now the boys were begging me for the raisin and offering me everything, a slug of their milk, a pencil, a comic book. Toby Mackey said I could have his sister and Mr. Benson heard him and took him out to the hallway and knocked him around till he howled. I wanted the raisin for myself but I saw Paddy Clohessy standing in the corner with no shoes and the room was freezing and he was shivering like a dog that had been kicked and I always felt sad over kicked dogs so I walked over and gave Paddy the raisin because I didn't know what else to do and all the boys yelled that I was a fool and a feckin' eejit and I'd regret the day and after I handed the raisin to Paddy I longed for it but it was too late now because he pushed it right into his mouth and gulped it and looked at me and said nothing and I said in my head what kind of an eejit are you to be giving away your raisin.\nMr. Benson gave me a look and said nothing and Nellie Ahearn said, You're a great oul'Yankee, Frankie.\nThe priest will come soon to examine us on the catechism and everything else. The master himself has to show us how to receive Holy\nCommunion. He tells us gather round him. He fills his hat with the Limerick Leader torn into little bits. He gives Paddy Clohessy the hat, kneels on the floor, tells Paddy to take one bit of paper and place it on his tongue. He shows us how to stick out the tongue, receive the bit of paper, hold it a moment, draw in the tongue, fold your hands in prayer, look toward heaven, close your eyes in adoration, wait for the paper to melt in your mouth, swallow it, and thank God for the gift, the Sanctifying Grace wafting in on the odor of sanctity. When he sticks out his tongue we have to hold in the laugh because we never saw a big purple tongue before. He opens his eyes to catch the boys who are giggling but he can't say anything because he still has God on his tongue and it's a holy moment. He gets off his knees and tells us kneel around the classroom for the Holy Communion practice. He goes around the room placing bits of paper on our tongues and mumbling in Latin. Some boys giggle and he roars at them that if the giggling doesn't stop it's not Holy Communion they'll be getting but the Last Rites and what is that sacrament called, McCourt?\nExtreme Unction, sir.\nThat's right, McCourt. Not bad for a Yank from the sinful shores of Amerikay.\nHe tells us we have to be careful to stick out our tongues far enough so that the Communion wafer won't fall to the floor. He says, That's the worst thing that can happen to a priest. If the wafer slides off your tongue that poor priest has to get down on his two knees, pick it up with his own tongue and lick the floor around it in case it bounced from one spot to another. The priest could get a splinter that would make his tongue swell to the size of a turnip and that's enough to choke you and kill you entirely.\nHe tells us that next to a relic of the True Cross the Communion wafer is the holiest thing in the world and our First Communion is the holiest moment in our lives. Talking about First Communion makes the master all excited. He paces back and forth, waves his stick, tells us we must never forget that the moment the Holy Communion is placed on our tongues we become members of that most glorious congregation, the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church, that for two thousand years men, women and children have died for the Faith, that the Irish have nothing to be ashamed of in the martyr department. Haven't we provided martyrs galore? Haven't we bared our necks to the Protestant ax? Haven't we mounted the scaffold, singing, as if embarking on a picnic, haven't we, boys?\nWe have, sir.\nWhat have we done, boys?\nBared our necks to the Protestant ax, sir.\nAnd?\nMounted the scaffold singing, sir.\nAs if?\nEmbarking on a picnic, sir.\nHe says that, perhaps, in this class there is a future priest or a\nmartyr for the Faith, though he doubts it very much for we are the laziest gang of ignoramuses it has ever been his misfortune to teach.\nBut it takes all kinds, he says, and surely God had some purpose when He sent the likes of ye to infest this earth. Surely God had a purpose when among us He sent Clohessy with no shoes, Quigley with his damnable questions and McCourt heavy with sin from America. And remember\nthis, boys, God did not send His only begotten Son to hang on the cross so that ye can go around on yeer First Communion day with the paws clutching for The Collection. Our Lord died so that ye might be redeemed. It is enough to receive the gift of Faith. Are ye listening to me?\nWe are, sir.\nAnd what's enough?\nThe gift of Faith, sir.\nGood. Go home.\nAt night three of us sit under the light pole at the top of the\nlane reading, Mikey, Malachy and I. The Molloys are like us with their father drinking the dole money or the wages and leaving no money for candles or paraffin oil for the lamp. Mikey reads books and the rest of us read comic books. His father, Peter, brings books from the Carnegie Library so that he'll have something to do when he's not drinking pints or when he's looking after the family anytime Mrs. Molloy is in the lunatic asylum. He lets Mikey read any book he likes and now Mikey is reading this book about Cuchulain and talking as if he knows everything about him. I want to tell him I knew all about Cuchulain when I was three going on four, that I saw Cuchulain in Dublin, that Cuchulain thinks nothing of dropping into my dreams. I want to tell him stop talking about Cuchulain, he's mine, he was mine years ago when I was young, but I can't because Mikey reads us a story I never heard of before, a dirty story about Cuchulain which I can never tell my father or mother, the story of how Emer became Cuchulain's wife.\nCuchulain was getting to be an old man of twenty-one. He was lonely and wanted to get married, which made him weak, says Mikey, and got him killed in the end. All the women in Ireland were mad about Cuchulain and they wanted to marry him. He said that would be grand, he wouldn't mind marrying all the women of Ireland. If he could fight all the men of Ireland why couldn't he marry all the women? But the King, Conor MacNessa, said, That's all very well for you, Cu, but the men of Ireland don't want to be lonely in the far reaches of the night. The King decided there would have to be a contest to see who would marry Cuchulain and it would be a pissing contest. All the women of Ireland assembled on the plains of Muirthemne to see who could piss the longest and it was Emer. She was the champion woman pisser of Ireland and married Cuchulain and that's why to this day she is called Great Bladdered Emer.\nMikey and Malachy laugh over this story though I don't think Malachy understands it. He's young and far from his First Communion and he's only laughing over the piss word. Then Mikey tells me I've committed a sin by listening to a story that has that word in it and when I go to my First Confession I'll have to tell the priest. Malachy says, That's right. Piss is a bad word and you have to tell the priest because 'tis a sin word.\nI don't know what to do. How can I go to the priest and tell him this terrible thing in my First Confession? All the boys know what sins they're going to tell so that they'll get the First Communion and make The Collection and go to see James Cagney and eat sweets and cakes at the Lyric Cinema. The master helped us with our sins and everyone has the same sins. I hit my brother. I told a lie. I stole a penny from my mother's purse. I disobeyed my parents, I ate a sausage on Friday.\nBut now I have a sin no one else has and the priest is going to be shocked and drag me out of the confession box into the aisle and out into the street where everyone will know I listened to a story about\nCuchulain's wife being the champion woman pisser in all Ireland. I'll never be able to make my First Communion and mothers will hold their small children up and point at me and say, Look at him. He's like Mikey Molloy, never made his First Communion, wandering around in a state of sin, never made The Collection, never saw James Cagney.\nI'm sorry I ever heard of First Communion and The Collection. I'm sick and I don't want any tea or bread or anything. Mam tells Dad it's a strange thing when a child won't have his bread and tea and Dad says, Och, he's just nervous over the First Communion. I want to go over to him and sit on his lap and tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me but I'm too big to be sitting on laps and if I did Malachy would go out in the lane and tell everyone I was a big baby. I'd like to tell my troubles to the Angel on the Seventh Step but he's busy bringing babies to mothers all over the world. Still, I'll ask Dad.\nDad, does the Angel on the Seventh Step have other jobs besides bringing babies?\nHe does.\nWould the Angel on the Seventh Step tell you what to do if you didn't know what to do?\nOch, he would, son, he would. That's the job of an angel, even the one on the seventh step.\nDad goes for a long walk, Mam takes Michael and goes to see Grandma, Malachy plays in the lane, and I have the house to myself so that I can sit on the seventh step and talk to the angel. I know he's there because the seventh step feels warmer than the other steps and there's a light in my head. I tell him my troubles and I hear a voice. Fear not, says the voice.\nHe's talking backward and I tell him I don't know what he's talking about.\nDo not fear, says the voice. Tell the priest your sin and you'll be forgiven.\nNext morning I'm up early and drinking tea with Dad and telling him about the Angel on the Seventh Step. He places his hand on my forehead to see if I'm feeling all right. He asks if I'm sure I had a light in my head and heard a voice and what did the voice say?\nI tell him the voice said Fear not and that means Do not fear.\nDad tells me the angel is right, I shouldn't be afraid, and I tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me. I tell him all about Great Bladdered Emer and I even use the piss word because the angel said, Fear not. Dad puts down his jam jar of tea and pats the back of my hand. Och, och, och, he says, and I wonder if he's going demented like Mrs. Molloy, in and out of the lunatic asylum, but he says, Is that what you were worried about last night?\nI tell him it is and he says it's not a sin and I don't have to tell the priest.\nBut the Angel on the Seventh Step said I should.\nAll right. Tell the priest if you like but the Angel on the Seventh Step said that only because you didn't tell me first. Isn't it better to be able to tell your father your troubles rather than an angel who is a light and a voice in your head?\n'Tis, Dad.\nThe day before First Communion the master leads us to St. Joseph's Church for First Confession. We march in pairs and if we so much as move a lip on the streets of Limerick he'll kill us on the spot and send us to\nhell bloated with sin. That doesn't stop the bragging about the big sins. Willie Harold is whispering about his big sin, that he looked at his sister's naked body. Paddy Hartigan says he stole ten shillings from his aunt's purse and made himself sick with ice cream and chips. Question Quigley says he ran away from home and spent half the night in a ditch with four goats. I try to tell them about Cuchulain and Emer but the master catches me talking and gives me a thump on the head.\nWe kneel in the pews by the confession box and I wonder if my Emer sin is as bad as looking at your sister's naked body because I know now that some things in the world are worse than others. That's why they have different sins, the sacrilege, the mortal sin, the venial sin. Then the masters and grown-up people in general talk about the unforgivable sin, which is a great mystery. No one knows what it is and you wonder how you can know if you've committed it if you don't know what it is. If I tell a priest about Great Bladdered Emer and the pissing contest he might say that's the unforgivable sin and kick me out of the confession box and I'll be disgraced all over Limerick and doomed to hell tormented forever by devils who have nothing else to do but stab me with hot pitchforks till I'm worn out.\nI try to listen to Willie's confession when he goes in but all I can hear is a hissing from the priest and when Willie comes out he's crying.\nIt's my turn. The confession box is dark and there's a big crucifix hanging over my head. I can hear a boy mumbling his confession on the other side. I wonder if there's any use trying to talk to the Angel on the Seventh Step. I know he's not supposed to be hanging around confession boxes but I feel the light in my head and the voice is telling me, Fear not.\nThe panel slides back before my face and the priest says, Yes, my child?\nBless me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my First Confession. Yes, my child, and what sins have you committed?\nI told a lie. I hit my brother. I took a penny from my mother's\npurse. I said a curse.\nYes, my child. Anything else?\nI, I listened to a story about Cuchulain and Emer.\nSurely that's not a sin, my child. After all we are assured by\ncertain writers that Cuchulain turned Catholic in his last moments as did his King, Conor MacNessa.\n'Tis about Emer, Father, and how she married him.\nHow was that, my child?\nShe won him in a pissing contest.\nThere is heavy breathing. The priest has his hand over his mouth\nand he's making choking sounds and talking to himself, Mother o' God. Who, who told you that story, my child?\nMikey Molloy, Father.\nAnd where did he hear it?\nHe read it in a book, Father.\nAh, a book. Books can be dangerous for children, my child. Turn your mind from those silly stories and think of the lives of the saints. Think of St. Joseph, the Little Flower, the sweet and gentle St. Francis of Assisi, who loved the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. Will you do that, my child?\nI will, Father.\nAre there any other sins, my child?\nNo, Father.\nFor your penance say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, and say a\nspecial prayer for me.\nI will. Father, was that the worst sin?\nWhat do you mean?\nAm I the worst of all the boys, Father?\nNo, my child, you have a long way to go. Now say an Act of\nContrition and remember Our Lord watches you every minute. God bless you, my child.\nFirst Communion day is the happiest day of your life because of The Collection and James Cagney at the Lyric Cinema. The night before I was so excited I couldn't sleep till dawn. I'd still be sleeping if my grandmother hadn't come banging at the door.\nGet up! Get up! Get that child outa the bed. Happiest day of his life an' him snorin' above in the bed.\nI ran to the kitchen. Take off that shirt, she said. I took off the shirt and she pushed me into a tin tub of icy cold water. My mother scrubbed me, my grandmother scrubbed me. I was raw, I was red.\nThey dried me. They dressed me in my black velvet First Communion suit with the white frilly shirt, the short pants, the white stockings, the black patent leather shoes. Around my arm they tied a white satin bow and on my lapel they pinned the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a picture of the Sacred Heart, with blood dripping from it, flames erupting all around it and on top a nasty looking crown of thorns.\nCome here till I comb your hair, said Grandma. Look at that mop, it won't lie down. You didn't get that hair from my side of the family. That's that North of Ireland hair you got from your father. That's the kind of hair you see on Presbyterians. If your mother had married a proper decent Limerickman you wouldn't have this standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair.\nShe spat twice on my head.\nGrandma, will you please stop spitting on my head. If you have anything to say, shut up. A little spit won't kill you. Come on, we'll be late for the Mass.\nWe ran to the church. My mother panted along behind with Michael in her arms. We arrived at the church just in time to see the last of the boys leaving the altar rail where the priest stood with the chalice and the host, glaring at me. Then he placed on my tongue the wafer, the body and blood of Jesus. At last, at last.\nIt's on my tongue. I draw it back.\nIt stuck.\nI had God glued to the roof of my mouth. I could hear the master's\nvoice, Don't let that host touch your teeth for if you bite God in two you'll roast in hell for eternity.\nI tried to get God down with my tongue but the priest hissed at me, Stop that clucking and get back to your seat.\nGod was good. He melted and I swallowed Him and now, at last, I was a member of the True Church, an official sinner.\nWhen the Mass ended there they were at the door of the church, my mother with Michael in her arms, my grandmother. They each hugged me to their bosoms. They each told me it was the happiest day of my life. They each cried all over my head and after my grandmother's contribution that morning my head was a swamp.\nMam, can I go now and make The Collection?\nShe said, After you have a little breakfast.\nNo, said Grandma. You're not making no collection till you've had a\nproper First Communion breakfast at my house. Come on.\nWe followed her. She banged pots and rattled pans and complained\nthat the whole world expected her to be at their beck and call. I ate the egg, I ate the sausage, and when I reached for more sugar for my tea she slapped my hand away.\nGo aisy with that sugar. Is it a millionaire you think I am? An American? Is it bedecked in glitterin' jewelry you think I am? Smothered in fancy furs?\nThe food churned in my stomach. I gagged. I ran to her backyard and threw it all up. Out she came.\nLook at what he did. Thrun up his First Communion breakfast. Thrun up the body and blood of Jesus. I have God in me backyard. What am I goin' to do? I'll take him to the Jesuits for they know the sins of the Pope himself.\nShe dragged me through the streets of Limerick. She told the neighbors and passing strangers about God in her backyard. She pushed me into the confession box.\nIn the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's a day since my last confession.\nA day? And what sins have you committed in a day, my child?\nI overslept. I nearly missed my First Communion. My grandmother said I have standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair. I threw up my First Communion breakfast. Now Grandma says she has God in her backyard and what should she do.\nThe priest is like the First Confession priest. He has the heavy breathing and the choking sounds.\nAh... ah... tell your grandmother to wash God away with a little water and for your penance say one Hail Mary and one Our Father. Say a prayer for me and God bless you, my child.\nGrandma and Mam were waiting close to the confession box. Grandma said, Were you telling jokes to that priest in the confession box? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you were telling jokes to Jesuits I'll tear the bloody kidneys outa you. Now what did he say about God in me backyard?\nHe said wash Him away with a little water, Grandma. Holy water or ordinary water?\nHe didn't say, Grandma.\nWell, go back and ask him.\nBut, Grandma...\nShe pushed me back into the confessional.\nBless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a minute since my last\nconfession.\nA minute! Are you the boy that was just here?\nI am, Father.\nWhat is it now?\nMy grandma says, Holy water or ordinary water? Ordinary water, and\ntell your grandmother not to be bothering me again.\nI told her, Ordinary water, Grandma, and he said don't be bothering\nhim again.\nDon't be bothering him again. That bloody ignorant bogtrotter.\nI asked Mam, Can I go now and make The Collection? I want to see James Cagney.\nGrandma said, You can forget about The Collection and James Cagney because you're not a proper Catholic the way you left God on the ground. Come on, go home.\nMam said, Wait a minute. That's my son. That's my son on his First Communion day. He's going to see James Cagney.\nNo he's not.\nYes he is.\nGrandma said, Take him then to James Cagney and see if that will\nsave his Presbyterian North of Ireland American soul. Go ahead.\nShe pulled her shawl around her and walked away.\nMam said, God, it's getting very late for The Collection and you'll\nnever see James Cagney. We'll go to the Lyric Cinema and see if they'll let you in anyway in your First Communion suit.\nWe met Mikey Molloy on Barrington Street. He asked if I was going to the Lyric and I said I was trying. Trying? he said. You don't have money?\nI was ashamed to say no but I had to and he said, That's all right. I'll get you in. I'll create a diversion.\nWhat's a diversion?\nI have the money to go and when I get in I'll pretend to have the fit and the ticket man will be out of his mind and you can slip in when I let out the big scream. I'll be watching the door and when I see you in I'll have a miraculous recovery. That's a diversion. That's what I do to get my brothers in all the time.\nMam said, Oh, I don't know about that, Mikey. Wouldn't that be a sin and surely you wouldn't want Frank to commit a sin on his First Communion day.\nMikey said if there was a sin it would be on his soul and he wasn't a proper Catholic anyway so it didn't matter. He let out his scream and I slipped in and sat next to Question Quigley and the ticket man, Frank Goggin, was so worried over Mikey he never noticed. It was a thrilling film but sad in the end because James Cagney was a public enemy and when they shot him they wrapped him in bandages and threw him in the door, shocking his poor old Irish mother, and that was the end of my First Communion day.\nV\nGrandma won't talk to Mam anymore because of what I did with God in her backyard. Mam doesn't talk to her sister, Aunt Aggie, or her brother Uncle Tom. Dad doesn't talk to anyone in Mam's family and they don't talk to him because he's from the North and he has the odd manner. No one talks to Uncle Tom's wife, Jane, because she's from Galway and she has the look of a Spaniard. Everyone talks to Mam's brother Uncle Pat, because he was dropped on his head, he's simple, and he sells newspapers. Everyone calls him The Abbot or Ab Sheehan and no one knows why. Everyone talks to Uncle Pa Keating because he was gassed in the war and married Aunt Aggie and if they didn't talk to him he wouldn't give a fiddler's fart anyway and that's why the men in South's pub call him a gas man.\nThat's the way I'd like to be in the world, a gas man, not giving a fiddler's fart, and that's what I tell the Angel on the Seventh Step till I remember you're not supposed to say fart in the presence of an angel.\nUncle Tom and Galway Jane have children but we're not supposed to talk to them because our parents are not talking. They have a son and daughter, Gerry and Peggy, and Mam will yell at us for talking to them but we don't know how not to talk to our cousins.\nPeople in families in the lanes of Limerick have their ways of not talking to each other and it takes years of practice. There are people who don't talk to each other because their fathers were on opposite sides in the Civil War in 1922. If a man goes off and joins the English army his family might as well move to another part of Limerick where there are families with men in the English army. If anyone in your family was the least way friendly to the English in the last eight hundred years it will be brought up and thrown in your face and you might as well move to Dublin where no one cares. There are families that are ashamed of themselves because their forefathers gave up their religion for the sake of a bowl of Protestant soup during the Famine and those families are known ever after as soupers. It's a terrible thing to be a souper because you're doomed forever to the souper part of hell. It's even worse to be an informer. The master at school said that everytime the Irish were about to demolish the English in a fair fight a filthy informer betrayed them. A man who's discovered to be an informer deserves to be hanged or, even worse, to have no one talk to him for if no one talks to you you're better off hanging at the end of a rope.\nIn every lane there's always someone not talking to someone or everyone not talking to someone or someone not talking to everyone. You can always tell when people are not talking by the way they pass each other. The women hoist their noses, tighten their mouths and turn their faces away. If the woman is wearing a shawl she takes a corner and flings it over her shoulder as if to say, One word or look from you, you ma faced bitch, and I'll tear the countenance from the front of your head.\nIt's bad when Grandma won't talk to us because we can't run to her when we need to borrow sugar or tea or milk. There's no use going to Aunt Aggie. She'll only bite your head off. Go home, she'll say, and tell your father to get off his northern arse and get a job like the decent men of Limerick.\nThey say she's always angry because she has red hair or she has red hair because she's always angry.\nMam is friendly with Bridey Hannon, who lives next door with her mother and father. Mam and Bridey talk all the time. When my father goes for his long walk Bridey comes in and she and Mam sit by the fire drinking tea and smoking cigarettes. If Mam has nothing in the house Bridey brings tea, sugar and milk. Sometimes they use the same tea leaves over and over and Mam says the tea is stewed, coddled and boiled.\nMam and Bridey sit so close to the fire their shins turn red and purple and blue. They talk for hours and they whisper and laugh over secret things. We're not supposed to hear the secret things so we're told go out and play. I often sit on the seventh step listening and they have no notion I'm there. It might be lashing rain out but Mam says, Rain or no, out you go, and she'll tell us, If you see your father coming, run in and tell me. Mam says to Bridey, Did you ever hear that poem that someone must have made up about me and him?\nWhat poem, Angela?\n'Tis called \"The Man from the North. \" I got this poem from Minnie MacAdorey in America.\nI never heard that poem. Say it for me.\nMam says the poem but she laughs all through it and I don't know why, He came from the North so his words were few But his voice was kind and his heart was true.\nAnd I knew by his eyes that no guile had he, So I married my man from the North Country.\nOh, Garryowen may be more gay\nThan this quiet man from beside Lough Neagh And I know that the sun shines softly down\nOn the river that runs through my native town.\nBut there's not-and I say it with joy and with pride A better man in all Munster wide\nAnd Limerick town has no happier hearth\nThan mine has been with my man from the North.\nI wish that in Limerick they only knew The kind kind neighbors I came unto. Small hate or scorn would there ever be Between the South and the North Country.\nShe always repeats the third verse and laughs so hard she's crying and I don't know why. She goes into hysterics when she says, And Limerick town has no happier hearth Than mine has been with my man from the North.\nIf he comes back early and sees Bridey in the kitchen the man from the North says, Gossip, gossip, gossip, and stands there with his cap on till she leaves.\nBridey's mother and other people in our lane and lanes beyond will come to the door to ask Dad if he'll write a letter to the government or a relation in a distant place. He sits at the table with his pen and bottle of ink and when the people tell him what to write he says, Och, no, that's not what you want to say, and he writes what he feels like writing. The people tell him that's what they wanted to say in the first place, that he has a lovely way with the English language and a fine fist for the writing. They offer him sixpence for his trouble but he waves it away and they hand it to Mam because he's too grand to be taking sixpence. When the people leave he takes the sixpence and sends me to Kathleen O'Connell's shop for cigarettes.\nGrandma sleeps in a big bed upstairs with a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus over her head and a statue of the Sacred Heart on the mantel piece. She wants to switch from gaslight to electric light someday so that she'll have a little red light under the statue forever. Her devotion to the Sacred Heart is known up and down the lane and in lanes beyond.\nUncle Pat sleeps in a small bed in a corner of the same room where Grandma can make sure he comes in at a proper hour and kneels by the bed to say his prayers. He might have been dropped on his head, he may not know how to read and write, he may drink one pint too many, but there's no excuse for not saying his prayers before he goes to sleep.\nUncle Pat tells Grandma he met a man who is looking for a place to stay that will let him wash himself morning and night and give him two\nmeals a day, dinner and tea. His name is Bill Galvin and he has a good job down at the lime kiln. He's covered all the time with white lime dust but surely that's better than coal dust.\nGrandma will have to give up her bed and move into the small room. She'll take the Sacred Heart picture and leave the statue to watch over the two men. Besides, she has no place for a statue in her little room.\nBill Galvin comes after work to see the place. He's small, all white, and he snuffles like a dog. He asks Grandma if she'd mind taking down that statue because he's a Protestant and he wouldn't be able to sleep. Grandma barks at Uncle Pat for not telling her he was dragging a Protestant into the house. Jesus, she says, there will be gossip up and down the lane and beyond.\nUncle Pat says he didn't know Bill Galvin was a Protestant. You could never tell by looking at him especially the way he's covered with lime. He looks like an ordinary Catholic and you'd never imagine a Protestant would be shoveling lime.\nBill Galvin says his poor wife that just died was a Catholic and she had the walls covered with pictures of the Sacred Heart and the Virgin Mary showing their hearts. He's not against the Sacred Heart himself, it's just that seeing the statue will remind him of his poor wife and give him the heartache.\nGrandma says, Ah, God help us, why didn't you tell me that in the first place? Sure I can put the statue on the windowsill in my room and your heart won't be tormented at the sight of it.\nEvery morning Grandma cooks Bill's dinner and takes it to him at the lime kiln. Mam wonders why he can't take it with him in the morning and Grandma says, Do you expect me to get up at dawn and boil cabbage and pig's toes for his lordship to take in his dinner can?\nMam tells her, In another week school will be over and if you give Frank sixpence a week he'll surely be glad to take Bill Galvin his dinner.\nI don't want to go to Grandma's every day. I don't want to take Bill Galvin his dinner all the way down the Dock Road, but Mam says that's sixpence we could use and if I don't do it I'm going nowhere else.\nYou're staying in the house, she says. You're not playing with your\npals.\nGrandma warns me to take the dinner can directly and not be\nmeandering, looking this way and that, kicking canisters and ruining the toes of my shoes. This dinner is hot and that's the way Bill Galvin wants\nit.\nThere's a lovely smell from the dinner can, boiled bacon and\ncabbage and two big floury white potatoes. Surely he won't notice if I try half a potato. He won't complain to Grandma because he hardly ever talks outside of a snuffle or two.\nIt's better if I eat the other half potato so that he won't be asking why he got a half. I might as well try the bacon and cabbage too and if I eat the other potato he'll surely think she didn't send one at all.\nThe second potato melts in my mouth and I'll have to try another bit of cabbage, another morsel of bacon. There isn't much left now and he'll be very suspicious so I might as well finish off the rest.\nWhat am I going to do now? Grandma will destroy me, Mam will keep me in for a year. Bill Galvin will bury me in lime. I'll tell him I was\nattacked by a dog on the Dock Road and he ate the whole dinner and I'm lucky I escaped without being eaten myself.\nOh, is that so? says Bill Galvin. And what's that bit of cabbage hanging on your gansey? Did the dog lick you wit his cabbagey gob? Go home and tell your grandmother you ate me whole dinner and I'm falling down with the hunger here in this lime kiln.\nShe'll kill me.\nTell her don't kill you till she sends me some class of a dinner and if you don't go to her now and get me a dinner I'll kill you and throw your body into the lime there and there won't be much left for your mother to moan over.\nGrandma says, What are you doin' back with that can? He could bring that back by himself.\nHe wants more dinner.\nWhat do you mean more dinner? Jesus above, is it a hole he has in his leg?\nHe's falling down with the hunger below in the lime kiln. Is it coddin' me you are?\nHe says send him any class of a dinner.\nI will not. I sent him his dinner.\nHe didn't get it.\nHe didn't? Why not?\nI ate it.\nWhat?\nI was hungry and I tasted it and I couldn't stop.\nJesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph.\nShe gives me a clout on the head that brings tears to my eyes. She\nscreams at me like a banshee and jumps around the kitchen and threatens to drag me to the priest, the bishop, the Pope himself if he lived around the corner. She cuts bread and waves the knife at me and makes sandwiches of brawn and cold potatoes.\nTake these sandwiches to Bill Galvin and if you even look cross- eyed at them I'll skin your hide.\nOf course she runs to Mam and they agree the only way I can make up for my terrible sin is to deliver Bill Galvin's dinner for a fortnight without pay. I'm to bring back the can every day and that means I have to sit watching him stuff the food into his gob and he's not one that would ever ask you if you had a mouth in your head.\nEvery day I take the can back Grandma makes me kneel to the statue of the Sacred Heart and tell Him I'm sorry and all this over Bill Galvin, a Protestant.\nMam says, I'm a martyr for the fags and so is your father.\nThere may be a lack of tea or bread in the house but Mam and Dad always manage to get the fags, the Wild Woodbines. They have to have the Woodbines in the morning and anytime they drink tea. They tell us every day we should never smoke, it's bad for your lungs, it's bad for your chest, it stunts your growth, and they sit by the fire puffing away. Mam says, If 'tis a thing I ever see you with a fag in your gob I'll break your face. They tell us the cigarettes rot your teeth and you can see they're not lying. The teeth turn brown and black in their heads and fall out one by one. Dad says he has holes in his teeth big enough for a sparrow to raise a family. He has a few left but he gets them pulled at the clinic and applies for a false set. When he comes home with the new teeth he shows his big new white smile that makes him look like an\nAmerican and whenever he tells us a ghost story by the fire he pushes the lower teeth up beyond his lip to his nose and frightens the life out of us. Mam's teeth are so bad she has to go to Barrington's Hospital to have them all pulled at the same time and when she comes home she's holding at her mouth a rag bright with blood. She has to sit up all night by the fire because you can't lie down when your gums are pumping blood or you'll choke in your sleep. She says she'll give up smoking entirely when this bleeding stops but she needs one puff of a fag this minute for the comfort that's in it. She tells Malachy go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and ask her would she ever let her have five Woodbines till Dad collects the dole on Thursday. If anyone can get the fags out of Kathleen, Malachy can. Mam says he has the charm, and she tells me, There's no use sending you with your long puss and your father's odd manner.\nWhen the bleeding stops and Mam's gums heal she goes to the clinic for her false teeth. She says she'll give up the smoking when her new teeth are in but she never does. The new teeth rub on her gums and make them sore and the smoke of the Woodbines eases them. She and Dad sit by the fire when we have one and smoke their cigarettes and when they talk their teeth clack. They try to stop the clacking by moving their jaws back and forth but that only makes it worse and they curse the dentists and the people above in Dublin who made the teeth and while they curse they clack. Dad claims these teeth were made for rich people in Dublin and didn't fit so they were passed on to the poor of Limerick who don't care because you don't have much to chew when you're poor anyway and you're grateful you have any class of a tooth in your head. If they talk too long their gums get sore and the teeth have to come out. Then they sit talking by the fire with their faces collapsed. Every night they leave the teeth in the kitchen in jam jars filled with water. Malachy wants to know why and Dad tells him it cleans them. Mam says, No, you can't have teeth in your head while you're sleeping for they'll slip and choke you to death entirely.\nThe teeth are the cause of Malachy going to Barrington's Hospital and me having an operation. Malachy whispers to me in the middle of the night, Do you want to go downstairs and see if we can wear the teeth?\nThe teeth are so big we have trouble getting them into our mouths but Malachy won't give up. He forces Dad's upper teeth into his mouth and can't get them out again. His lips are drawn back and the teeth make a big grin. He looks like a monster in a film and it makes me laugh but he pulls at them and grunts, Uck, uck, and tears come to his eyes. The more he goes Uck, uck, the harder I laugh till Dad calls from upstairs, What are you boys doing? Malachy runs from me, up the stairs, and now I hear Dad and Mam laughing till they see he can choke on the teeth. They both stick their fingers in to pull out the teeth but Malachy gets frightened and makes desperate uck uck sounds. Mam says, We'll have to take him to the hospital, and Dad says he'll take him. He makes me go in case the doctor has questions because I'm older than Malachy and that means I must have started all the trouble. Dad rushes through the streets with Malachy in his arms and I try to keep up. I feel sorry for Malachy up there on Dad's shoulder, looking back at me, tears on his cheeks and Dad's teeth bulging in his mouth. The doctor at Barrington's Hospital says, No bother. He pours oil into Malachy's mouth and has the teeth out in a minute. Then he looks at me and says to Dad, Why is that child standing there with his mouth hanging open?\nDad says, That's a habit he has, standing with his mouth open.\nThe doctor says, Come here to me. He looks up my nose, in my ears, down my throat, and feels my neck.\nThe tonsils, he says. The adenoids. They have to come out. The sooner the better or he'll look like an idiot when he grows up with that gob wide as a boot.\nNext day Malachy gets a big piece of toffee as a reward for sticking in teeth he can't get out and I have to go to the hospital to have an operation that will close my mouth.\nOn a Saturday morning Mam finishes her tea and says, You're going to dance.\nDance? Why?\nYou're seven years old, you made your First Communion, and now 'tis time for the dancing. I'm taking you down to Catherine Street to Mrs. O'Connor's Irish dancing classes. You'll go there every Saturday morning and that'll keep you off the streets. That'll keep you from wandering around Limerick with hooligans.\nShe tells me wash my face not forgetting ears and neck, comb my hair, blow my nose, take the look off my face, what look? never mind, just take it off, put on my stockings and my First Communion shoes which, she says, are destroyed because I can't pass a canister or a rock without kicking it. She's worn out standing in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society begging for boots for me and Malachy so that we can wear out the toes with the kicking. Your father says it's never too early to learn the songs and dances of your ancestors.\nWhat's ancestors?\nNever mind, she says, you're going to dance.\nI wonder how I can die for Ireland if I have to sing and dance for\nIreland, too. I wonder why they never say, You can eat sweets and stay home from school and go swimming for Ireland.\nMam says, Don't get smart or I'll warm your ear.\nCyril Benson dances. He has medals hanging from his shoulders to his kneecaps. He wins contests all over Ireland and he looks lovely in his saffron kilt. He's a credit to his mother and he gets his name in the paper all the time and you can be sure he brings home the odd few pounds. You don't see him roaming the streets kicking everything in sight till the toes hang out of his boots, oh, no, he's a good boy, dancing for his poor mother.\nMam wets an old towel and scrubs my face till it stings, she wraps the towel around her finger and sticks it in my ears and claims there's enough wax there to grow potatoes, she wets my hair to make it lie down, she tells me shut up and stop the whinging, that these dancing lessons will cost her sixpence every Saturday, which I could have earned bringing Bill Galvin his dinner and God knows she can barely afford it. I try to tell her, Ah, Mam, sure you don't have to send me to dancing school when you could be smoking a nice Woodbine and having a cup of tea, but she says, Oh, aren't you clever. You're going to dance if I have to give up the fags forever.\nIf my pals see my mother dragging me through the streets to an Irish dancing class I'll be disgraced entirely. They think it's all right to dance and pretend you're Fred Astaire because you can jump all over the screen with Ginger Rogers. There is no Ginger Rogers in Irish dancing and you can't jump all over. You stand straight up and down and keep your arms against yourself and kick your legs up and around and never smile.\nMy uncle Pa Keating said Irish dancers look like they have steel rods up their arses, but I can't say that to Mam, she'd kill me.\nThere's a gramophone in Mrs. O'Connor's playing an Irish jig or a reel and boys and girls are dancing around kicking their legs out and keeping their hands to their sides. Mrs. O'Connor is a great fat woman and when she stops the record to show the steps all the fat from her chin to her ankles jiggles and I wonder how she can teach the dancing. She comes over to my mother and says, So, this is little Frankie? I think we have the makings of a dancer here. Boys and girls, do we have the makings of a dancer here?\nWe do, Mrs. O'Connor.\nMam says, I have the sixpence, Mrs. O'Connor.\nAh, yes, Mrs. McCourt, hold on a minute.\nShe waddles to a table and brings back the head of a black boy with\nkinky hair, big eyes, huge red lips and an open mouth. She tells me put the sixpence in the mouth and take my hand out before the black boy bites me. All the boys and girls watch and they have little smiles. I drop in the sixpence and pull my hand back before the mouth snaps shut. Everyone laughs and I know they wanted to see my hand caught in the mouth. Mrs. O'Connor gasps and laughs and says to my mother, Isn't that a howl, now? Mam says it's a howl. She tells me behave myself and come home dancing. I don't want to stay in this place where Mrs. O'Connor can't take the sixpence herself instead of letting me nearly lose my hand in the black boy's mouth.\nI don't want to stay in this place where you have to stand in line with boys and girls, straighten your back, hands by your sides, look ahead, don't look down, move your feet, move your feet, look at Cyril, look at Cyril, and there goes Cyril, all dressed up in his saffron kilt and the medals jingling, medals for this and medals for that and the girls love Cyril and Mrs. O'Connor loves Cyril for didn't he bring her fame and didn't she teach him every step he knows, oh, dance, Cyril, dance, oh, Jesus, he floats around the room, he's an angel out of heaven and stop the frowning, Frankie McCourt, or you'll have a puss on you like a pound of tripe, dance, Frankie, dance, pick up your feet for the love o' Jesus, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree, Maura, will you help that Frankie McCourt before he ties his two feet around his poll entirely, help him, Maura.\nMaura is a big girl about ten. She dances up to me with her white teeth and her dancer's dress with all the gold and yellow and green figures that are supposed to come from olden times and she says, Give me your hand, little boy, and she wheels me around the room till I'm dizzy and making a pure eejit of myself and blushing and foolish till I want to cry but I'm saved when the record stops and the gramophone goes hoosh hoosh.\nMrs. O'Connor says, Oh, thank you, Maura, and next week, Cyril, you can show Frankie a few of the steps that made you famous. Next week, boys and girls, and don't forget the sixpence for the little black boy.\nBoys and girls leave together. I make my own way down the stairs and out the door hoping my pals won't see me with boys who wear kilts and girls with white teeth and fancy dresses from olden times.\nMam is having tea with Bridey Hannon, her friend from next door. Mam says, What did you learn? and makes me dance around the kitchen, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree. She has a good\nlaugh with Bridey. That's not too bad for your first time. In a month you'll be like a regular Cyril Benson.\nI don't want to be Cyril Benson. I want to be Fred Astaire.\nThey turn hysterical, laughing and squirting tea out of their mouths, Jesus love him, says Bridey. Doesn't he have a great notion of himself. Fred Astaire how are you.\nMam says Fred Astaire went to his lessons every Saturday and didn't go around kicking the toes out of his boots and if I wanted to be like him I'd have to go to Mrs. O'Connor's every week.\nThe fourth Saturday morning Billy Campbell knocks at our door. Mrs. McCourt, can Frankie come out and play? Mam tells him, No, Billy. Frankie is going to his dancing lesson.\nHe waits for me at the bottom of Barrack Hill. He wants to know why I'm dancing, that everyone knows dancing is a sissy thing and I'll wind up like Cyril Benson wearing a kilt and medals and dancing all over with girls. He says next thing I'll be sitting in the kitchen knitting socks. He says dancing will destroy me and I won't be fit to play any kind of football, soccer, rugby or Gaelic football itself because the dancing teaches you to run like a sissy and everyone will laugh.\nI tell him I'm finished with the dancing, that I have sixpence in my pocket for Mrs. O'Connor that's supposed to go into the black boy's mouth, that I'm going to the Lyric Cinema instead. Sixpence will get the two of us in with tuppence left over for two squares of Cleeves' toffee, and we have a great time looking at Riders of the Purple Sage.\nDad is sitting by the fire with Mam and they want to know what steps I learned today and what they're called. I already did \"The Siege of Ennis\" and \"The Walls of Limerick, \" which are real dances. Now I have to make up names and dances. Mam says she never heard of a dance called \"The Siege of Dingle\"but if that's what I learned go ahead, dance it, and I dance around the kitchen with my hands down by my sides making my own music, diddley eye di eye di eye diddley eye do you do you, Dad and Mam clapping in time with my feet. Dad says, Och, that's a fine dance and you'll be a powerful Irish dancer and a credit to the men who died for their country. Mam says, That wasn't much for a sixpence.\nNext week it's a George Raft film and the week after that a cowboy film with George O'Brien. Then it's James Cagney and I can't take Billy because I want to get a bar of chocolate to go with my Cleeves' toffee and I'm having a great time till there's a terrible pain in my jaw and it's a tooth out of my gum stuck in my toffee and the pain is killing me. Still, I can't waste the toffee so I pull out the tooth and put it in my pocket and chew the toffee on the other side of my mouth blood and all. There's pain on one side and delicious toffee on the other and I remember what my uncle Pa Keating would say, There are times when you wouldn't know whether to shit or go blind.\nI have to go home now and worry because you can't go through the world short a tooth without your mother knowing. Mothers know everything and she's always looking into our mouths to see if there's any class of disease. She's there by the fire and Dad is there and they're asking me the same old questions, the dance and the name of the dance. I tell them I learned \"The Walls of Cork\" and I dance around the kitchen trying to hum a made up tune and dying with the pain of my tooth. Mam says, \"Walls o' Cork, \" my eye, there's no such dance, and Dad says, Come over here. Stand there before me. Tell us the truth, Did you go to your dancing classes today?\nI can't tell a lie anymore because my gum is killing me and there's blood in my mouth. Besides, I know they know everything and that's what they're telling me now. Some snake of a boy from the dancing school saw me going to the Lyric Cinema and told and Mrs. O'Connor sent a note to say she hadn't seen me in ages and was I all right because I had great promise and could follow in the footsteps of the great Cyril Benson.\nDad doesn't care about my tooth or anything. He says I'm going to confession and drags me over to the Redemptorist church because it's Saturday and confessions go on all day. He tells me I'm a bad boy, he's ashamed of me that I went to the pictures instead of learning Ireland's national dances, the jig, the reel, the dances that men and women fought and died for down those sad centuries. He says there's many a young man that was hanged and now moldering in a lime pit that would be glad to rise up and dance the Irish dance.\nThe priest is old and I have to yell my sins at him and he tells me I'm a hooligan for going to the pictures instead of my dancing lessons although he thinks himself that dancing is a dangerous thing almost as bad as the films, that it stirs up thoughts sinful in themselves, but even if dancing is an abomination I sinned by taking my mother's sixpence and lying and there's a hot place in hell for the likes of me, say a decade of the rosary and ask God's forgiveness for you're dancing at the gates of hell itself, child.\nI'm seven, eight, nine going on ten and still Dad has no work. He drinks his tea in the morning, signs for the dole at the Labour Exchange, reads the papers at the Carnegie Library, goes for his long walks far into the country. If he gets a job at the Limerick Cement Company or Rank's Flour Mills he loses it in the third week. He loses it because he goes to the pubs on the third Friday of the job, drinks all his wages and misses the half day of work on Saturday morning.\nMam says, Why can't he be like the other men from the lanes of Limerick? They're home before the Angelus rings at six o'clock, they hand over their wages, change their shirts, have their tea, get a few shillings from the wife and they're off to the pub for a pint or two.\nMam tells Bridey Hannon that Dad can't be like that and won't be like that. She says he's a right bloody fool the way he goes to pubs and stands pints to other men while his own children are home with their bellies stuck to their backbones for the want of a decent dinner. He'll brag to the world he did his bit for Ireland when it was neither popular nor profitable, that he'll gladly die for Ireland when the call comes, that he regrets he has only one life to give for his poor misfortunate country and if anyone disagrees they're invited to step outside and settle this for once and for all.\nOh, no, says Mam, they won't disagree and they won't step outside, that bunch of tinkers and knackers and begrudgers that hang around the pubs. They tell him he's a grand man, even if he's from the North, and 'twould be an honor to accept a pint from such a patriot.\nMam tells Bridey, I don't know under God what I'm going to do. The dole is nineteen shillings and sixpence a week, the rent is six and six, and that leaves thirteen shillings to feed and clothe five people and keep us warm in the winter.\nBridey drags on her Woodbine, drinks her tea and declares that God is good. Mam says she's sure God is good for someone somewhere but He hasn't been seen lately in the lanes of Limerick.\nBridey laughs. Oh, Angela, you could go to hell for that, and Mam says, Aren't I there already, Bridey?\nAnd they laugh and drink their tea and smoke their Woodbines and tell one another the fag is the only comfort they have.\n'Tis.\nQuestion Quigley tells me I have to go to the Redemptorist church on Friday and join the boys' division of the Arch Confraternity. You have to join. You can't say no. All the boys in the lanes and back streets that have fathers on the dole or working in laboring jobs have to join.\nQuestion says, Your father is a foreigner from the North and he don't matter but you still have to join.\nEveryone knows Limerick is the holiest city in Ireland because it has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family, the biggest sodality in the world. Any city can have a Confraternity, only Limerick has the Arch.\nOur Confraternity fills the Redemptorist church five nights a week, three for the men, one for the women, one for the boys. There is Benediction and hymn singing in English, Irish and Latin and best of all the big powerful sermon Redemptorist priests are famous for. It's the sermon that saves millions of Chinese and other heathens from winding up in hell with the Protestants.\nThe Question says you have to join the Confraternity so that your mother can tell the St. Vincent de Paul Society and they'll know you're a good Catholic. He says his father is a loyal member and that's how he got a good pensionable job cleaning lavatories at the railway station and when he grows up himself he'll get a good job too unless he runs away and joins the Royal Canadian Mounted Police so that he can sing \"I'll Be Calling You Ooo Ooo Ooo, \" like Nelson Eddy singing to Jeanette MacDonald expiring with consumption there on the sofa. If he brings me to the Confraternity the man in the office will write his name in a big book and some day he might be promoted to prefect of a section, which is all he wants in life next to wearing the Mountie uniform.\nThe prefect is head of a section which is thirty boys from the same lanes and streets. Every section has the name of a saint whose picture is painted on a shield stuck on top of a pole by the prefect's seat. The prefect and his assistant take the attendance and keep an eye on us so that they can give us a thump on the head in case we laugh during Benediction or commit any other sacrileges. If you miss one night the man in the office wants to know why, wants to know if you're slipping away from the Confraternity or he might say to the other man in the office, I think our little friend here has taken the soup. That's the worst thing you can say to any Catholic in Limerick or Ireland itself because of what happened in the Great Famine. If you're absent twice the man in the office sends you a yellow summons to appear and explain yourself and if you're absent three times he sends The Posse, which is five or six big boys from your section who search the streets to make sure you're not out enjoying yourself when you should be on your knees at the Confraternity praying for the Chinese and other lost souls. The Posse will go to your house and tell your mother your immortal soul is in danger. Some mothers worry but others will say, Get away from my door or I'll come out and give every one o' ye a good fong in the hole of yeer arse. These are not good Confraternity mothers and the director will say we should pray for them that they'll see the error of their ways.\nThe worst thing of all is a visit from the director of the Confraternity himself, Father Gorey. He'll stand at the top of the lane\nand roar in the voice that converted the Chinese millions, Where is the house of Frank McCourt? He roars even though he has your address in his pocket and knows very well where you live. He roars because he wants the world to know you're slipping away from the Confraternity and putting your immortal soul in danger. The mothers are terrified and the fathers will whisper, I'm not here, I'm not here, and they'll make sure you go to the Confraternity from this on out so they won't be disgraced and shamed entirely with the neighbors muttering behind their hands.\nThe Question takes me to the section St. Finbar's, and the prefect tells me sit over there and shut up. His name is Declan Collopy, he's fourteen and he has lumps on his forehead that look like horns. He has thick ginger eyebrows that meet in the middle and hang over his eyes and his arms hang down to his kneecaps. He tells me he's making this the best section in the Confraternity and if I'm ever absent he'll break my arse and send the bits to my mother. There's no excuse for absence because there was a boy in another section that was dying and still they brought him in on a stretcher. He says, If you're ever absent it better be a death, not a death in the family but your own death. Do you hear me?\nI do, Declan.\nBoys in my section tell me that prefects get rewards if there is perfect attendance. Declan wants to get out of school as soon as he can and get a job selling linoleum at Cannock's big shop on Patrick Street. His uncle, Foncey, sold linoleum there for years and made enough money to start his own shop in Dublin, where he has his three sons selling linoleum. Father Gorey, the director, can easily get Declan the reward of a job at Cannock's if he's a good prefect and has perfect attendance in his section and that's why Declan will destroy us if we're absent. He tells us, No one will stand between me and the linoleum.\nDeclan likes Question Quigley and lets him miss an occasional Friday night because the Question said, Declan, when I grow up and get married I'm going to cover my house in linoleum and I'll buy it all from you.\nOther boys in the section try this trick with Declan but he says, Bugger off, ye'll be lucky enough to have a pot to piss in never mind yards of linoleum.\nDad says when he was my age in Toome he served Mass for years and it's time for me to be an altar boy. Mam says, What's the use? The child doesn't have proper clothes for school never mind the altar. Dad says the altar boy robes will cover the clothes and she says we don't have the money for robes and the wash they need every week.\nHe says God will provide and makes me kneel on the kitchen floor. He takes the part of the priest for he has the whole Mass in his head and I have to know the responses. He says, Introibo ad altare Dei, and I have to say, Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam.\nEvery evening after tea I kneel for the Latin and he won't let me move till I'm perfect. Mam says he could at least let me sit but he says Latin is sacred and it is to be learned and recited on the knees. You won't find the Pope sitting around drinking tea while he speaks the Latin.\nThe Latin is hard and my knees are sore and scabby and I'd like to be out in the lane playing though still I'd like to be an altar boy helping the priest vest in the sacristy, up there on the altar all decked out in my red and white robes like my pal Jimmy Clark, answering the priest in Latin, moving the big book from one side of the tabernacle to\nthe other, pouring water and wine into the chalice, pouring water over the priest's hands, ringing the bell at Consecration, kneeling, bowing, swinging the censer at Benediction, sitting off to the side with the palms of my hands on my knees all serious while he gives his sermon, everyone in St. Joseph's looking at me and admiring my ways.\nIn a fortnight I have the Mass in my head and it's time to go to St. Joseph's to see the sacristan, Stephen Carey, who is in charge of altar boys. Dad polishes my boots. Mam darns my socks and throws an extra coal on the fire to heat up the iron to press my shirt. She boils water to scrub my head, neck, hands and knees and any inch of skin that shows. She scrubs till my skin burns and tells Dad she wouldn't give it to the world to say her son went on the altar dirty. She wishes I didn't have scabby knees from running around kicking canisters and falling down pretending I was the greatest footballer in the world. She wishes we had a drop of hair oil in the house but water and spit will keep my hair from sticking up like black straw in a mattress. She warns me speak up when I go to St. Joseph's and don't be mumbling in English or Latin. She says, 'Tis a great pity you grew out of your First Communion suit but you have nothing to be ashamed of, you come from good blood, McCourts, Sheehans, or my mother's family the Guilfoyles that owned acre after acre in County Limerick before the English took it away and gave it to footpads from London.\nDad holds my hand going through the streets and people look at us because of the way we're saying Latin back and forth. He knocks at the sacristy door and tells Stephen Carey, This is my son, Frank, who knows the Latin and is ready to be an altar boy.\nStephen Carey looks at him, then me. He says, We don't have room for him, and closes the door.\nDad is still holding my hand and squeezes till it hurts and I want to cry out. He says nothing on the way home. He takes off his cap, sits by the fire and lights a Woodbine. Mam is smoking, too. Well, she says, is he going to be an altar boy?\nThere's no room for him.\nOh. She puffs on her Woodbine. I'll tell you what it is, she says. 'Tis class distinction. They don't want boys from lanes on the altar. They don't want the ones with scabby knees and hair sticking up. Oh, no, they want the nice boys with hair oil and new shoes that have fathers with suits and ties and steady jobs. That's what it is and 'tis hard to hold on to the Faith with the snobbery that's in it.\nOch, aye.\nOh, och aye my arse. That's all you ever say. You could go to the priest and tell him you have a son that has a head stuffed with Latin and why can't he be an altar boy and what is he going to do with all that Latin?\nOch, he might grow up to be a priest.\nI ask him if I can go out and play. Yes, he says, go out and play. Mam says, You might as well.\nVI\nMr. O'Neill is the master in the fourth class at school. We call him Dotty because he's small like a dot. He teaches in the one classroom with\na platform so that he can stand above us and threaten us with his ash plant and peel his apple for all to see. The first day of school in September he writes on the blackboard three words which are to stay there the rest of the year, Euclid, geometry, idiot. He says if he catches any boy interfering with these words that boy will go through the rest of his life with one hand. He says anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Now, repeat after me, Anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Of course we all know what an idiot is because that's what the masters keep telling us we are.\nBrendan Quigley raises his hand. Sir, what's a theorem and what's a Euclid?\nWe expect Dotty to lash at Brendan the way all the masters do when you ask them a question but he looks at Brendan with a little smile. Ah, now, here's a boy with not one but two questions. What is your name, boy?\nBrendan Quigley, sir.\nThis is a boy who will go far. Where will he go, boys?\nFar, sir.\nIndeed and he will. The boy who wants to know something about the\ngrace, elegance and beauty of Euclid can go nowhere but up. In what direction and no other can this boy go, boys?\nUp, sir.\nWithout Euclid, boys, mathematics would be a poor doddering thing. Without Euclid we wouldn't be able to go from here to there. Without Euclid the bicycle would have no wheel. Without Euclid St. Joseph could not have been a carpenter for carpentry is geometry and geometry is carpentry. Without Euclid this very school could never have been built.\nPaddy Clohessy mutters behind me, Feckin' Euclid.\nDotty barks at him. You, boy, what is your name?\nClohessy, sir.\nAh, the boy flies on one wing. What is your Christian name? Paddy.\nPaddy what?\nPaddy, sir.\nAnd what, Paddy, were you saying to McCourt? I said we\ndown on our two knees and thank God for Euclid.\nI'm sure you did, Clohessy. I see the lie festering in\nWhat do I see, boys?\nThe lie, sir.\nAnd what is the lie doing, boys?\nFestering, sir.\nWhere, boys, where?\nIn his teeth, sir.\nEuclid, boys, was a Greek. What, Clohessy, is a Greek? Some class of a foreigner, sir.\nClohessy, you are a half-wit. Now, Brendan, surely you\nshould get\nyour teeth.\nknow what a\nGreek is?\nYes, sir. Euclid was a Greek.\nDotty gives him the little smile. He tells Clohessy he should model\nhimself on Quigley, who knows what a Greek is. He draws two lines side by side and tells us these are parallel lines and the magical and mysterious thing is that they never meet, not if they were to be extended to infinity, not if they were extended to God's shoulders and that, boys, is a long way though there is a German Jew who is upsetting the whole world with his ideas on parallel lines.\nWe listen to Dotty and wonder what all this has to do with the state of the world with the Germans marching everywhere and bombing everything that stands. We can't ask him ourselves but we can get Brendan Quigley to do it. Anyone can see Brendan is the master's pet and that means he can ask any question he likes. After school we tell Brendan he has to ask the question tomorrow, What use is Euclid and all those lines that go on forever when the Germans are bombing everything? Brendan says he doesn't want to be the master's pet, he didn't ask for it, and he doesn't want to ask the question. He's afraid if he asks that question Dotty will attack him. We tell him if he doesn't ask the question we'll attack him.\nNext day Brendan raises his hand. Dotty gives him the little smile. Sir, what use is Euclid and all the lines when the Germans are bombing everything that stands?\nThe little smile is gone. Ah, Brendan. Ah, Quigley. Oh, boys, oh, boys.\nHe lays his stick on the desk and stands on the platform with his eyes closed. What use is Euclid? he says. Use? Without Euclid the Messerschmitt could never have taken to the sky. Without Euclid the Spitfire could not dart from cloud to cloud. Euclid brings us grace and beauty and elegance. What does he bring us, boys?\nGrace, sir.\nAnd?\nBeauty, sir.\nAnd?\nElegance, sir.\nEuclid is complete in himself and divine in application. Do you\nunderstand that, boys?\nWe do, sir.\nI doubt it, boys, I doubt it. To love Euclid is to be alone in this world.\nHe opens his eyes and sighs and you can see the eyes are a little watery.\nPaddy Clohessy is leaving the school that day and he's stopped by Mr. O'Dea, who teaches the fifth class. Mr. O'Dea says, You, what's your\nname?\nClohessy, sir.\nWhat class are you in?\nFourth class, sir.\nNow tell me, Clohessy, is that master of yours talking to you about\nEuclid?\nHe is, sir.\nAnd what is he saying?\nHe's saying he's a Greek.\nOf course he is, you diddering omadhaun. What else is he saying? He's saying there would be no school without Euclid.\nAh. Now is he drawing anything on the board?\nHe's drawing lines side by side that will never meet even if they\nland on God's shoulders.\nMother o' God.\nNo, sir. God's shoulders.\nI know, you idiot. Go home.\nThe next day there's a great noise at our classroom door and Mr. O'Dea is yelling, Come out, O'Neill, you chancer, you poltroon. We can hear everything he's saying because of the broken glass over the door.\nThe new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, is saying, Now, now, Mr. O'Dea. Control yourself. No quarreling in front of our pupils.\nWell, then, Mr. O'Halloran, tell him stop teaching the geometry. The geometry is for the fifth form and not the fourth. The geometry is mine. Tell him to teach the long division and leave Euclid to me. Long division will stretch his intellect such as it is, God help us. I don't want the minds of these boys destroyed by that chancer up there on the platform, him handing out apple skins and causing diarrhea right and left. Tell him Euclid is mine, Mr. O'Halloran, or I'll put a stop to his gallop.\nMr. O'Halloran tells Mr. O'Dea to return to his classroom and asks Mr. O'Neill to step into the hall. Mr. O'Halloran says, Now, Mr. O'Neill, I have asked you before to stay away from Euclid.\nYou have, Mr. O'Halloran, but you might as well ask me to stop eating my daily apple.\nI'll have to insist, Mr. O'Neill. No more Euclid.\nMr. O'Neill comes back to the room and his eyes are watery again. He says little has changed since the time of the Greeks for the barbarians are within the gates and their names are legion. What has changed since the time of the Greeks, boys?\nIt is torture to watch Mr. O'Neill peel the apple every day, to see the length of it, red or green, and if you're up near him to catch the freshness of it in your nose. If you're the good boy for that day and you answer the questions he gives it to you and lets you eat it there at your desk so that you can eat it in peace with no one to bother you the way they would if you took it into the yard. Then they'd torment you, Gimme a piece, gimme a piece, and you'd be lucky to have an inch left for yourself.\nThere are days when the questions are too hard and he torments us by dropping the apple peel into the wastebasket. Then he borrows a boy from another class to take the wastebasket down to the furnace to burn papers and apple peel or he'll leave it for the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, to take it all away in her big canvas sack. We'd like to ask Nellie to keep the peel for us before the rats get it but she's weary from cleaning the whole school by herself and she snaps at us, I have other things to be doin' with me life besides watchin' a scabby bunch rootin' around for the skin of an apple. Go 'way.\nHe peels the apple slowly. He looks around the room with the little smile. He teases us, Do you think, boys, I should give this to the pigeons on the windowsill? We say, No, sir, pigeons don't eat apples. Paddy Clohessy calls out, 'Twill give them the runs, sir, and we'll have it on our heads abroad in the yard.\nClohessy, you are an omadhaun. Do you know what an omadhaun is?\nI don't, sir.\nIt's the Irish, Clohessy, your native tongue, Clohessy. An omadhaun\nis a fool, Clohessy. You are an omadhaun. What is he, boys? An omadhaun, sir.\nClohessy says, That's what Mr. O'Dea called me, sir, a diddering omadhaun.\nHe pauses in his peeling to ask us questions about everything in the world and the boy with the best answers wins. Hands up, he says, who is the President of the United States of America?\nEvery hand in the class goes up and we're all disgusted when he asks a question that any omadhaun would know. We call out, Roosevelt.\nThen he says, You, Mulcahy, who stood at the foot of the cross when Our Lord was crucified?\nMulcahy is slow. The Twelve Apostles, sir. Mulcahy, what is the Irish word for fool? Omadhaun, sir.\nAnd what are you, Mulcahy?\nAn omadhaun, sir.\nFintan Slattery raises his hand. I know who stood at the foot of the cross, sir.\nOf course Fintan knows who stood at the foot of the cross. Why wouldn't he? He's always running off to Mass with his mother, who is known for her holiness. She's so holy her husband ran off to Canada to cut down trees, glad to be gone and never to be heard from again. She and Fintan say the rosary every night on their knees in the kitchen and read all kinds of religious magazines: The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart, The Lantern, The Far East, as well as every little book printed by the Catholic Truth Society. They go to Mass and Communion rain or shine and every Saturday they confess to the Jesuits who are known for their interest in intelligent sins not the usual sins you hear from people in lanes who are known for getting drunk and sometimes eating meat on Fridays before it goes bad and cursing on top of it. Fintan and his mother live on Catherine Street and Mrs. Slattery's neighbors call her Mrs. Offer-It-Up because no matter what happens, a broken leg, a spilled cup of tea, a disappeared husband, she says, Well, now, I'll offer that up and I'll have no end of Indulgences to get me into heaven. Fintan is just as bad. If you push him in the schoolyard or call him names he'll smile and tell you he'll pray for you and he'll offer it up for his soul and yours. The boys in Leamy's don't want Fintan praying for them and they threaten to give him a good fong in the arse if they catch him praying for them. He says he wants to be a saint when he grows up, which is ridiculous because you can't be a saint till you're dead. He says our grandchildren will be praying to his picture. One big boy says, My grandchildren will piss on your picture, and Fintan just smiles. His sister ran away to England when she was seventeen and everyone knows he wears her blouse at home and curls his hair with hot iron tongs every Saturday night so that he'll look gorgeous at Mass on Sunday. If he meets you going to Mass he'll say, Isn't my hair gorgeous, Frankie? He loves that word, gorgeous, and no other boy will ever use it.\nOf course he knows who stood at the foot of the cross. He probably knows what they were wearing and what they had for breakfast and now he's telling Dotty O'Neill it was the three Marys. Dotty says, Come up here, Fintan, and take your reward. He takes his time going to the platform and we can't believe our eyes when he takes out a pocketknife to cut the apple peel into little bits so that he can eat them one by one and not be stuffing the whole thing into his mouth like the rest of us when we win. He raises his hand, Sir, I'd like to give some of my apple away.\nThe apple, Fintan? No, indeed. You do not have the apple, Fintan. You have the peel, the mere skin. You have not nor will you ever achieve\nheights so dizzy you'll be feasting on the apple itself. Not my apple, Fintan. Now did I hear you say you want to give away your reward?\nYou did, sir. I'd like to give three pieces, to Quigley, Clohessy and McCourt.\nWhy, Fintan?\nThey're my friends, sir.\nThe boys around the room are sneering and nudging each other and I\nfeel ashamed because they'll say I curl my hair and I'll be tormented in the schoolyard and why does he think I'm his friend? If they say I wear my sister's blouse there's no use telling them I don't have a sister because they'll say, You'd wear it if you had a sister. There's no use saying anything in the schoolyard because there's always someone with an answer and there's nothing you can do but punch them in the nose and if you were to punch everyone who has an answer you'd be punching morning noon and night.\nQuigley takes the bit of peel from Fintan. Thanks, Fintan.\nThe whole class is looking at Clohessy because he's the biggest and the toughest and if he says thanks I'll say thanks. He says, Thanks very much, Fintan, and blushes and I say, Thanks very much, Fintan, and I try to stop myself from blushing but I can't and all the boys sneer again and I'd like to hit them.\nAfter school the boys call to Fintan, Hoi, Fintan, are you goin'home to curl your gorgeous hair? Fintan smiles and climbs the steps of the schoolyard. A big boy from seventh class says to Paddy Clohessy, I suppose you'd be curlin' your hair too if you wasn't a baldy with a shaved head.\nPaddy says, Shurrup, and the boy says, Oh, an' who's goin' to make me? Paddy tries a punch but the big boy hits his nose and knocks him down and there's blood. I try to hit the big boy but he grabs me by the throat and bangs my head against the wall till I see lights and black dots. Paddy walks away holding his nose and crying and the big boy pushes me after him. Fintan is outside on the street and he says, Oh, Francis, Francis, oh, Patrick, Patrick, what's up? Why are you crying, Patrick? and Paddy says, I'm hungry. I can't fight nobody because I'm starving with the hunger an' fallin' down an' I'm ashamed of meself.\nFintan says, Come with me, Patrick. My mother will give us something, and Paddy says, Ah, no, me nose is bleedin'.\nDon't worry. She'll put something on your nose or a key on the back of your neck. Francis, you must come, too. You always look hungry.\nAh, no, Fintan.\nAh, do, Francis.\nAll right, Fintan.\nFintan's flat is like a chapel. There are two pictures, the Sacred\nHeart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Jesus is showing His heart with the crown of thorns, the fire, the blood. His head is tilted to the left to show His great sorrow. The Virgin Mary is showing her heart and it would be a pleasant heart if it didn't have that crown of thorns. Her head is tilted to the right to show her sorrow because she knows her Son will come to a sad end.\nThere's a picture on another wall of a man with a brown robe and birds sitting all over him. Fintan says, Do you know who that is, Francis? No? That's your patron, St. Francis of Assisi, and do you know what today is?\nThe fourth of October.\nThat's right and it's his feast day and special for you because you can ask St. Francis for anything and he'll surely give it to you. That's why I wanted you to come here today. Sit down, Patrick, sit down, Francis.\nMrs. Slattery comes in with her rosary beads in her hand. She's happy to meet Fintan's new friends and would we like a cheese sandwich? And look at your poor nose, Patrick. She touches his nose with the cross on her rosary beads and says a little prayer. She tells us these rosary beads were blessed by the Pope himself and would stop the flow of a river if requested never mind Patrick's poor nose.\nFintan says he won't have a sandwich because he's fasting and praying for the boy who hit Paddy and me. Mrs. Slattery gives him a kiss on the head and tells him he's a saint out of heaven and asks if we'd like mustard on our sandwiches and I tell her I never heard of mustard on cheese and I'd love it. Paddy says, I dunno. I never had a sangwidge in me life, and we all laugh and I wonder how you could live ten years like Paddy and never have a sandwich. Paddy laughs, too, and you can see his teeth are white and black and green.\nWe eat the sandwich and drink tea and Paddy wants to know where the lavatory is. Fintan takes him through the bedroom to the backyard and when they come back Paddy says, I have to go home. Me mother'll kill me. I'll wait for you outside, Frankie.\nNow I have to go to the lavatory and Fintan leads me to the backyard. He says, I have to go, too, and when I unbutton my fly I can't pee because he's looking at me and he says, You were fooling. You don't have to go at all. I like to look at you, Francis. That's all. I wouldn't want to commit any class of a sin with our Confirmation coming next year.\nPaddy and I leave together. I'm bursting and run behind a garage to pee. Paddy is waiting for me and as we walk along Hartstonge Street he says, That was a powerful sangwidge, Frankie, an' him an' his mother is very holy but I wouldn't want to go to Fintan's flat anymore because he's very odd, isn't he, Frankie?\nHe is, Paddy.\nThe way he looks at it when you take it out, that's odd, isn't it, Frankie?\n'Tis, Paddy.\nA few days later Paddy whispers, Fintan Slattery said we could come to his flat at lunchtime. His mother won't be there and she leaves his lunch for him. He might give us some too and he has lovely milk. Will we go?\nFintan sits two rows from us. He knows what Paddy is saying to me and he moves his eyebrows up and down as if to say, Will you come? I whisper yes to Paddy and he nods to Fintan and the master barks at us to stop waggling our eyebrows and our lips or the ash plant will sing across our backsides.\nBoys in the schoolyard see the three of us walk out and they pass remarks. Oh, Gawd, look at Fintan and his ingles. Paddy says, Fintan, what's an ingle? and Fintan says it's just a boy from olden times who sits in a corner, that's all. He tells us sit at the table in his kitchen and we can read his comic books if we like, Film Fun, the Beano, the Dandy, or the religious magazines or his mother's romance magazines, the Miracle and the Oracle, which always have stories about factory girls who are poor but beautiful in love with sons of earls and vice versa and the factory girl ends up throwing herself into the Thames with the\nhopelessness only to be rescued by a passing carpenter who is poor but honest and will love the factory girl for her own humble self though it turns out the passing carpenter is really the son of a duke, which is much higher than an earl, so that now the poor factory girl is a duchess and can look down her nose at the earl who spurned her because she's happy tending her roses on her twelve-thousand-acre estate in Shropshire and being kind to her poor old mother, who refuses to leave her humble little cottage for all the money in the world.\nPaddy says, I don't want to read nothing, it's all a cod, all them stories. Fintan removes the cloth covering his sandwich and glass of milk. The milk looks creamy and cool and delicious and the sandwich bread is almost as white. Paddy says, Is that a ham sangwidge? and Fintan says, 'Tis. Paddy says, That's a lovely looking sangwidge and is there mustard on it? Fintan nods and slices the sandwich in two. Mustard seeps out. He licks it off his fingers and takes a nice mouthful of milk. He cuts the sandwich again into quarters, eighths, sixteenths, takes The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart from the pile of magazines and reads while he eats his sandwich bits and drinks his milk and Paddy and I look at him and I know Paddy is wondering what we're doing here at all, at all, because that's what I'm wondering myself hoping Fintan will pass over the plate to us but he doesn't, he finishes the milk, leaves bits of sandwich on the plate, covers it with the cloth and wipes his lips in his dainty way, lowers his head, blesses himself and says grace after meals and, God, we'll be late for school, and blesses himself again on the way out with holy water from the little china font hanging by the door with the little image of the Virgin Mary showing her heart and pointing at it with two fingers as if we couldn't make it out for ourselves.\nIt's too late for Paddy and me to run and get the bun and milk from Nellie Ahearn and I don't know how I'm going to last from now till I can run home after school and get a piece of bread. Paddy stops at the school gate. He says, I can't go in there starving with the hunger. I'd fall asleep and Dotty'd kill me.\nFintan is anxious. Come on, come on, we'll be late. Come on, Francis, hurry up.\nI'm not going in, Fintan. You had your lunch. We had nothing.\nPaddy explodes. You're a feckin' chancer, Fintan. That's what you are an' a feckin' begrudger too with your feckin' sangwidge an' your feckin' Sacred Heart of Jesus on the wall an' your feckin' holy water. You can kiss my arse, Fintan.\nOh, Patrick.\nOh, Patrick my feckin' arse, Fintan. Come on, Frankie.\nFintan runs into school and Paddy and I make our way to an orchard\nin Ballinacurra. We climb a wall and a fierce dog comes at us till Paddy talks to him and tells him he's a good dog and we're hungry and go home to your mother. The dog licks Paddy's face and trots away waving his tail and Paddy is delighted with himself. We stuff apples into our shirts till we can barely get back over the wall to run into a long field and sit under a hedge eating the apples till we can't swallow another bit and we stick our faces into a stream for the lovely cool water. Then we run to opposite ends of a ditch to shit and wipe ourselves with grass and thick leaves. Paddy is squatting and saying, There's nothing in the world like a good feed of apples, a drink of water and a good shit, better than any sangwidge of cheese and mustard and Dotty O'Neill can shove his apple up his arse.\nThere are three cows in a field with their heads over a stone wall and they say moo to us. Paddy says, Bejasus, 'tis milkin' time, and he's over the wall, stretched on his back under a cow with her big udder hanging into his face. He pulls on a teat and squirts milk into his mouth. He stops squirting and says, Come on, Frankie, fresh milk. 'Tis lovely. Get that other cow, they're all ready for the milkin'.\nI get under the cow and pull on a teat but she kicks and moves and I'm sure she's going to kill me. Paddy comes over and shows me how to do it, pull hard and straight and the milk comes out in a powerful stream. The two of us lie under the one cow and we're having a great time filling ourselves with milk when there's a roar and there's a man with a stick charging across the field. We're over the wall in a minute and he can't follow us because of his rubber boots. He stands at the wall and shakes his stick and shouts that if he ever catches us we'll have the length of his boot up our arses and we laugh because we're out of harm's way and I'm wondering why anyone should be hungry in a world full of milk and apples.\nIt's all right for Paddy to say Dotty can shove the apple up his arse but I don't want to rob orchards and milk cows forever and I'll always try to win Dotty's apple peel so that I can go home and tell Dad how I answered the hard questions.\nWe're walking back through Ballinacurra. There's rain and lightning and we run but it's hard for me with the sole of my shoe flapping and threatening to trip me. Paddy can run all he wants in his long bare feet and you hear them slapping on the pavement. My shoes and stockings are soaked and they make their own sound, squish, squish. Paddy notices that and we make a song from our two sounds, slap slap, squish, squish, slap squish, squish slap. We laugh so hard over our song we have to hold on to one another. The rain gets heavier and we know we can't stand under a tree or we'll be fried entirely so we stand by a door which is opened in a minute by a big fat maid in a little white hat and a black dress with a little white apron who tells us get away from this door we're a disgrace. We run from the door and Paddy calls back, Mullingar heifer, beef to the heels, and he laughs till he chokes and has to lean against a wall with the weakness. There's no sense in standing in from the rain anymore, we're soaked to the skin, so we take our time down O'Connell Avenue. Paddy says he learned that Mullingar heifer thing from his uncle Peter, the one that was in India in the English army and they have a photo of him standing with a group of soldiers with their helmets and guns and bandoliers around their chests and there are dark men in uniform who are Indians and loyal to the King. Uncle Peter had a great time for himself in a place called Kashmir, which is lovelier than Killarney that they're always bragging about and singing. Paddy goes on again about running away and winding up in India in a silken tent with the girl with the red dot and the curry and the figs and he's making me hungry even if I'm stuffed with apples and milk.\nThe rain is clearing and there are birds honking over our heads. Paddy says they're ducks or geese or something on their way to Africa where it's nice and warm. The birds have more sense than the Irish. They come to the Shannon for their holidays and then they go back to the warm places, maybe even India. He says he'll write me a letter when he's over there and I can come to India and have my own girl with a red dot.\nWhat's that dot for, Paddy?\nIt shows they're high class, the quality.\nBut, Paddy, would the quality in India talk to you if they knew you were from a lane in Limerick and had no shoes?\nCourse they would, but the English quality wouldn't. The English quality wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.\nSteam of their piss? God, Paddy, did you think of that yourself?\nNaw, naw, that's what my father says below in the bed when he's coughin' up the gobs and blamin' the English for everything.\nAnd I think, Steam of their piss. I'll keep that for myself. I'll go around Limerick saying it, Steam of their piss, Steam of their piss, and when I go to America some day I'll be the only one who knows it.\nQuestion Quigley is wobbling toward us on a big woman's bicycle and calls to me, Hoi, Frankie McCourt, you're going to be killed. Dotty O'Neill sent a note to your house and said you didn't come back to school after lunch, that you went on the mooch with Paddy Clohessy. Your mother is going to kill you. Your father is out looking for you and he's going to kill you, too.\nOh, God, I feel cold and empty and I wish I could be in India where it's nice and warm and there's no school and my father could never find me to kill me. Paddy tells the Question, He didn't go on the mooch and I didn't either. Fintan Slattery starved us to death and we were too late for the bun and the milk. Then Paddy says to me, Don't mind 'em, Frankie, 'tis all a cod. They're always sendin' notes to our house and we wipe our arses with them.\nMy mother and father would never wipe their arses with a note from the master and I'm afraid now to go home. The Question rides off on the bicycle, laughing, and I don't know why because he once ran away from home and slept in a ditch with four goats and that's worse than mooching from school half a day anytime.\nI could turn up the Barrack Road now and go home and tell my parents I'm sorry I went on the mooch and I did it because of the hunger but Paddy says, Come on, we'll go down the Dock Road and throw rocks in the Shannon.\nWe throw rocks in the river and we swing on the iron chains along the bank. It's getting dark and I don't know where I'm going to sleep. I might have to stay there by the Shannon or find a door or I might have to go back out the country and find a ditch like Brendan Quigley with four goats. Paddy says I can go home with him, I can sleep on the floor and I'll dry out.\nPaddy lives in one of the tall houses on Arthur's Quay looking at the river. Everyone in Limerick knows these houses are old and might fall down at any minute. Mam often says, I don't want any of ye going down to Arthur's Quay and if I find ye there I'll break yeer faces. The people down there are wild and ye could get robbed and killed.\nIt's raining again and small children are playing in the hallway and up the stairs. Paddy says, Mind yourself, because some of the steps are missing and there is shit on the ones that are still there. He says that's because there's only one privy and it's in the backyard and children don't get down the stairs in time to put their little arses on the bowl, God help us.\nThere's a woman with a shawl sitting on the fourth flight smoking a cigarette. She says, Is that you, Paddy?\n'Tis, Mammy.\nI'm fagged out, Paddy. Them steps is killin' me. Did you have your tea?\nI didn't.\nWell, I don't know if there's any bread left. Go up an' see. Paddy's family live in one big room with a high ceiling and a small\nfireplace. There are two tall windows and you can see out to the Shannon. His father is in a bed in the corner, groaning and spitting into a bucket. Paddy's brothers and sisters are on mattresses on the floor, sleeping, talking, looking at the ceiling. There's a baby with no clothes crawling over to Paddy's father's bucket and Paddy pulls him away. His mother comes in, gasping, from the stairs. Jesus, I'm dead, she says.\nShe finds some bread and makes weak tea for Paddy and me. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. They don't say anything. They don't say what are you doing here or go home or anything till Mr. Clohessy says, Who's that? and Paddy tells him, 'Tis Frankie McCourt.\nMr. Clohessy says, McCourt? What class of a name is that? My father is from the North, Mr. Clohessy.\nAnd what's your mother's name?\nAngela, Mr. Clohessy.\nAh, Jaysus, 'twouldn't be Angela Sheehan, would it?\n'Twould, Mr. Clohessy. Ah, Jaysus, he says, and he has a coughing fit which brings up all kinds of stuff from his insides and has him hanging over the bucket. When the cough passes he falls back on the pillow. Ah, Frankie, I knew your mother well. Danced with her, Mother o' Christ, I'm dying inside, danced with her I did below in the Wembley Hall and a champion dancer she was too.\nHe hangs over the bucket again. He gasps for air and reaches his arms out to get it. He suffers but he won't stop talking.\nChampion dancer she was, Frankie. Not skinny mind you but a feather in my arms and there was many a sorry man when she left Limerick. Can you dance, Frankie?\nAh, no, Mr. Clohessy.\nPaddy says, He can, Dada. He had the lessons from Mrs. O'Connor and Cyril Benson.\nWell, dance, Frankie. Round the house an' mind the dresser, Frankie. Lift the foot, lad.\nI can't, Mr. Clohessy. I'm no good.\nNo good? Angela's Sheehan's son? Dance, Frankie, or I'll get outa this bed an' wheel you round the house.\nMy shoe is broken, Mr. Clohessy.\nFrankie, Frankie, you're bringin' the cough on me. Will you dance for the love o' Jesus so I can remember me youth with your mother in the Wembley Hall. Take off the feckin' shoe, Frankie, an' dance.\nI have to make up dances and tunes to go with them the way I did a long time ago when I was young. I dance around the room with one shoe because I forgot to take it off. I try to make up words, Oh, The Walls of Limerick are falling down, falling down, falling down, The Walls of Limerick falling down and the River Shannon kills us.\nMr. Clohessy is laughing in the bed. Oh, Jaysus, I never heard likes o' that on land or sea. That's a great leg for the dancing you have there, Frankie. Oh, Jaysus. He coughs and brings up ropes of green and yellow stuff. It makes me sick to look at it and I wonder if I should go home from all this sickness and this bucket and let my parents kill me if they want to.\nPaddy lies down on a mattress by the window and I lie beside him. I keep my clothes on like everybody else and I even forget to take off my\nother shoe, which is wet and squishy and stinks. Paddy falls asleep right away and I look at his mother sitting by the bit of a fire smoking another cigarette. Paddy's father groans and coughs and spits into the bucket. He says, Feckin' blood, and she says, You'll have to go into the sanatorium sooner or later.\nI will not. The day they put you in there is the end of you.\nYou could be givin'the consumption to the children. I could get the guards to take you away you're that much of a danger to the children.\nIf they were to get it they'd have it be now.\nThe fire dies and Mrs. Clohessy climbs over him into the bed. In a minute she's snoring even if he's still coughing and laughing about the days of his youth when he danced with Angela Sheehan light as a feather in the Wembley Hall.\nIt's cold in the room and I'm shivering in my wet clothes. Paddy is shivering too but he's asleep and he doesn't know he's cold. I don't know if I should stay here or get up and go home but who wants to be wandering the streets when a guard might ask you what you're doing out. It's my first time away from my family and I know I'd rather be in my own house with the smelly lavatory and stable next door. It's bad when our kitchen is a lake and we have to go up to Italy but it's worse in the Clohessys' when you have to go down four flights to the lavatory and slip on shit all the way down. I'd be better off with four goats in a ditch.\nI drift in and out of sleep but I have to wake up for good when Mrs. Clohessy goes around pulling at her family to get them up. They all went to bed with their clothes on so they don't have to get dressed and there's no fighting. They grumble and run out the door to get downstairs to the backyard lavatory. I have to go too and I run down with Paddy but his sister Peggy is on the bowl and we have to piss against a wall. She says, I'll tell Ma what ye did, and Paddy says, Shurrup or I'll push you down into that feckin' lavatory. She jumps off the lavatory, pulls her drawers up and runs up the stairs crying, I'll tell, I'll tell, and when we get back to the room Mrs. Clohessy gives Paddy a belt on the head for what he did to his poor little sister. Paddy says nothing because Mrs. Clohessy is spooning porridge into mugs and jam jars and one bowl and telling us to eat up and go to school. She sits at the table eating her porridge. Her hair is gray black and dirty. It dangles in the bowl and picks up bits of porridge and drops of milk. The children slurp the porridge and complain they didn't get enough, they're starving with the hunger. They have snotty noses and sore eyes and scabby knees. Mr. Clohessy coughs and squirms on the bed and brings up the great gobs of blood and I run out of the room and puke on the stairs where there's a step missing and there's a shower of porridge and bits of apple to the floor below where people go back and forth to the lavatory in the yard. Paddy comes down and says, Sure that's all right. Everywan gets sick an' shits on them stairs an' the whole feckin' place is falling down anyway.\nI don't know what I'm supposed to do now. If I go back to school I'll be killed and why should I go back to school or go home to get killed when I can go out the road and live on milk and apples the rest of my life till I go to America. Paddy says, Come on. School is all a cod anyway an' the masters is all madmen.\nThere's a knock at the Clohessys' door and it's Mam holding my little brother, Michael, by the hand, and Guard Dennehy, who is in charge of school attendance. Mam sees me and says, What are you doing with one shoe on? and Guard Dennehy says, Ah, now, missus, I think a more\nimportant question would be, What are you doing with one shoe off, ha,\nha.\nMichael runs to me. Mammy was crying. Mammy was crying for you,\nFrankie.\nShe says, Where were you all night?\nI was here.\nYou had me demented. Your father walked every street in Limerick\nlooking for you.\nMr. Clohessy says, Who's at the door?\nIt's my mother, Mr. Clohessy.\nGod above, is that Angela?\n'Tis, Mr. Clohessy.\nHe struggles up on his elbows. Well, for the love of God, will you\ncome in, Angela. Don't you know me?\nMam looks puzzled. It's dark in the room and she tries to make out\nwho is in the bed. He says, 'Tis me, Dennis Clohessy, Angela. Ah, no.\n'Tis, Angela.\nAh, no.\nI know, Angela. I'm changed. The cough is killin' me. But I\nremember the nights at the Wembley Hall. Aw, Jaysus, you were a great dancer. Nights at the Wembley Hall, Angela, and the fish and chips after. Oh, boys, oh, boys, Angela.\nMy mother has tears running down her face. She says, You were a great dancer yourself, Dennis Clohessy.\nWe could have won competitions, Angela. Fred and Ginger would have been lookin' over their shoulders but you had to run off to America. Aw, Jaysus.\nHe has another coughing fit and we have to stand and watch him hang over the bucket again and bring up the bad stuff from his insides. Guard Dennehy says, I think, missus, we found the by an' I'll be going. He says to me, If you ever go on the mooch again, by, we'll have you in the jail above. Are you listenin' to me, by?\nI am, Guard.\nDon't be tormentin' your mother, by. That's wan thing the guards won't put up with, the tormentin' of mothers.\nI won't, Guard. I won't torment her.\nHe leaves and Mam goes to the bed to take Mr. Clohessy's hand. His face is caved in all around his eyes and his hair is shiny black with the sweat running from the top of his head. His children stand around the bed looking at him and looking at Mam. Mrs. Clohessy sits by the fire rattling the poker in the grate and pushing the baby away from the fire. She says, 'Tis his own bloody fault for not goin' into hospital, so 'tis.\nMr. Clohessy gasps, I'd be all right if I could live in a dry place. Angela, is America a dry place?\n'Tis, Dennis.\nThe doctor told me go to Arizona. A funny man that doctor. Arizona how are you. I don't have the money to go around the corner for a pint.\nMam says, You'll be all right, Dennis. I'll light a candle for you. Save your money, Angela. My dancin' days are done.\nI have to go now, Dennis. My son has to go to school.\nBefore you go, Angela, will you do one thing for me?\nI will, Dennis, if 'tis in my power.\nWould you ever give us a verse of that song you sang the night before you went to America?\nThat's a hard song, Dennis. I wouldn't have the wind for it.\nAh, come on, Angela. I never hear a song anymore. There isn't a song in this house. The wife there doesn't have a note in her head an' no step in her foot.\nMam says, All right. I'll try.\nOh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune, Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.\nWhen the boys began to gather in the glen of a Summer night, And the Kerry piper's tuning made us long with wild delight.\nShe stops and presses her hand to her chest, Oh, God, my wind is gone. Help me, Frank, with the song, and I sing along, Oh, to think of it, Oh, to dream of it, fills my heart with tears.\nOh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.\nMr. Clohessy tries to sing with us, gone, alas, like our youth too soon, but it brings on the cough. He shakes his head and cries, I wouldn't doubt you, Angela. It takes me back. God bless you.\nGod bless you, too, Dennis, and thanks, Mrs. Clohessy, for having Frankie here off the streets.\n'Twas no trouble, Mrs. McCourt. He's quiet enough.\nQuiet enough, says Mr. Clohessy, but he's not the dancer his mother\nwas.\nMam says, 'Tis hard to dance with one shoe, Dennis.\nI know, Angela, but you'd wonder why he didn't take it off. Is he a\nbit strange?\nAh, sometimes he has the odd manner like his father. Oh, yes. The\nfather is from the North, Angela, and that would account for it. They'd think nothing of dancing with one shoe in the North.\nWe walk up Patrick Street and O'Connell Street, Paddy Clohessy and Mam and Michael and myself, and Mam sobs all the way. Michael says, Don't cry, Mammy. Frankie won't run away.\nShe lifts him up and hugs him. Oh, no, Michael, 'tisn't Frankie I'm crying about. 'Tis Dennis Clohessy and the dancing nights at the Wembley Hall and the fish and chips after.\nShe comes into the school with us. Mr. O'Neill looks cross and tells us sit down he'll be with us in a minute. He talks a long time at the door with my mother and when she leaves he walks between the seats and pats Paddy Clohessy on the head.\nI'm very sorry for the Clohessys and all their troubles but I think they saved me from getting into trouble with my mother.\nVII\nThere are Thursdays when Dad gets his dole money at the Labour Exchange and a man might say, Will we go for a pint, Malachy? and Dad will say, One, only one, and the man will say, Oh, God, yes, one, and before the night is over all the money is gone and Dad comes home singing and getting us out of bed to line up and promise to die for Ireland when the\ncall comes. He even gets Michael up and he's only three but there he is singing and promising to die for Ireland at the first opportunity. That's what Dad calls it, the first opportunity. I'm nine and Malachy is eight and we know all the songs. We sing all the verses of Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley, \"The West's Asleep, \"\n\"O'Donnell Abu, \"\n\"The Boys of Wexford. \" We sing and promise to die because you never know when Dad might have a penny or two left over from the drinking and if he gives it to us we can run to Kathleen O'Connell's next day for toffee. Some nights he says Michael is the best singer of all and he gives him the penny. Malachy and I wonder what's the use of being eight and nine and knowing all the songs and ready to die when Michael gets the penny so that he can go to the shop next day and stuff his gob with toffee galore. No one can ask him to die for Ireland at the age of three, not even Padraig Pearse, who was shot by the English in Dublin in 1916 and expected the whole world to die with him. Besides, Mikey Molloy's father said anyone who wants to die for Ireland is a donkey's arse. Men have been dying for Ireland since the beginning of time and look at the state of the country.\nIt's bad enough that Dad loses jobs in the third week but now he drinks all the dole money once a month. Mam gets desperate and in the morning she has the bitter face and she won't talk to him. He has his tea and leaves the house early for the long walk into the country. When he returns in the evening she still won't talk to him and she won't make his tea. If the fire is dead for the want of coal or turf and there's no way of boiling water for the tea, he says, Och, aye, and drinks water out of a jam jar and smacks his lips the way he would with a pint of porter. He says good water is all a man needs and Mam makes a snorting sound. When she's not talking to him the house is heavy and cold and we know we're not supposed to talk to him either for fear she'll give us the bitter look. We know Dad has done the bad thing and we know you can make anyone suffer by not talking to him. Even little Michael knows that when Dad does the bad thing you don't talk to him from Friday to Monday and when he tries to lift you to his lap you run to Mam.\nI'm nine years old and I have a pal, Mickey Spellacy, whose relations are dropping one by one of the galloping consumption. I envy Mickey because every time someone dies in his family he gets a week off from school and his mother stitches a black diamond patch on his sleeve so that he can wander from lane to lane and street to street and people will know he has the grief and pat his head and give him money and sweets for his sorrow.\nBut this summer Mickey is worried. His sister, Brenda, is wasting away with the consumption and it's only August and if she dies before September he won't get his week off from school because you can't get a week off from school when there's no school. He comes to Billy Campbell and me to ask if we'll go around the corner to St. Joseph's Church and pray for Brenda to hang on till September.\nWhat's in it for us, Mickey, if we go around the corner praying?\nWell, if Brenda hangs on and I get me week off ye can come to the wake and have ham and cheese and cake and sherry and lemonade and everything and ye can listen to the songs and stories all night.\nWho could say no to that? There's nothing like a wake for having a good time. We trot around to the church where they have statues of St. Joseph himself as well as the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and\nSt. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, the Little Flower. I pray to the Little Flower because she died of the consumption herself and she'd understand.\nOne of our prayers must have been powerful because Brenda stays alive and doesn't die till the second day of school. We tell Mickey we're sorry for his troubles but he's delighted with his week off and he gets the black diamond patch which will bring the money and sweets.\nMy mouth is watering at the thought of the feast at Brenda's wake. Billy knocks on the door and there's Mickey's aunt. Well?\nWe came to say a prayer for Brenda and Mickey said we could come to the wake.\nShe yells, Mickey! What? Come here. Did you tell this gang they could come to your sister's wake?\nNo.\nBut, Mickey, you promised...\nShe slams the door in our faces. We don't know what to do till\nBilly Campbell says, We'll go back to St. Joseph's and pray that from now on everyone in Mickey Spellacy's family will die in the middle of the summer and he'll never get a day off from school for the rest of his life.\nOne of our prayers is surely powerful because next summer Mickey himself is carried off by the galloping consumption and he doesn't get a day off from school and that will surely teach him a lesson.\nProddy Woddy ring the bell,\nNot for heaven but for hell.\nOn Sunday mornings in Limerick I watch them go to church, the Protestants, and I feel sorry for them, especially the girls, who are so lovely, they have such beautiful white teeth. I feel sorry for the beautiful Protestant girls, they're doomed. That's what the priests tell us. Outside the Catholic Church there is no salvation. Outside the Catholic Church there is nothing but doom. And I want to save them. Protestant girl, come with me to the True Church. You'll be saved and you won't have the doom. After Mass on Sunday I go with my friend Billy Campbell to watch them play croquet on the lovely lawn beside their church on Barrington Street. Croquet is a Protestant game. They hit the ball with the mallet, pock and pock again, and laugh. I wonder how they can laugh or don't they even know they're doomed? I feel sorry for them and I say, Billy, what's the use of playing croquet when you're doomed?\nHe says, Frankie, what's the use of not playing croquet when you're doomed?\nGrandma says to Mam, Your brother Pat, bad leg an' all, was selling papers all over Limerick by the time he was eight and that Frank of yours is big and ugly enough to work.\nBut he's only nine and still in school.\nSchool. 'Tis school that has him the way he is talkin' back an' goin' around with the sour puss an' the odd manner like his father. He could get out an' help poor Pat of a Friday night when the Limerick Leader is a ton weight. He could run up the long garden paths of the quality an' save Pat's poor legs an' earn a few pennies into the bargain.\nHe has to go to the Confraternity on Friday nights.\nNever mind the Confraternity. There's nothin' in the catechism about confraternities.\nI meet Uncle Pat at the Limerick Leader on Friday evening at five. The man handing out the papers says my arms are that skinny I'd be lucky to carry two stamps but Uncle Pat sticks eight papers under each arm. He tells me, I'll kill you if you drop 'em for 'tis raining abroad, pelting out of the heavens. He tells me hug the walls going up O'Connell Street to keep the papers dry. I'm to run in where there's a delivery, climb the outside steps, in the door, up the stairs, yell Paper, get the money they owe him for the week, down the stairs, give him the money and on to the next stop. Customers give him tips for his troubles and he keeps them for himself.\nWe make our way up O'Connell Avenue, out Ballinacurra, in by the South Circular Road, down Henry Street and back to the office for more papers. Uncle Pat wears a cap and a thing like a cowboy poncho to keep his papers dry but he complains his feet are killing him and we stop in a pub for a pint for his poor feet. Uncle Pa Keating is there all black and having a pint and he says to Uncle Pat, Ab, are you going to let that boy stand there with his face hanging out for the want of a lemonade?\nUncle Pat says, Wha? and Uncle Pa Keating gets impatient. Christ, he's dragging your feckin' papers all over Limerick and you can't-Oh, never mind. Timmy, give the child a lemonade. Frankie, don't you have a raincoat at home?\nNo, Uncle Pa.\nYou're not supposed to be out in this weather. You're drenched entirely. Who sent you out in this muck?\nGrandma said I had to help Uncle Pat because of his bad leg. Course she did, the oul' bitch, but don't tell them I said that. Uncle Pat is struggling off the seat and gathering up his papers.\nCome on, 'tis gettin' dark.\nHe hobbles along the streets calling, Anna Lie Sweets Lie, which\ndoesn't sound a bit like Limerick Leader and it doesn't matter because everyone knows this is Ab Sheehan that was dropped on his head. Here, Ab, give us a Leader, how's your poor leg, keep the change an' get yourself a fag for 'tis an awful feckin' night to be out sellin' the feckin' papers.\nTanks, says Ab, my uncle. Tanks, tanks, tanks, and it's hard to keep up with him on the streets bad as his leg is. He says, How many Leaders have you under your oxter?\nOne, Uncle Pat.\nTake that Leader in to Mr. Timoney. He owes me for a fortnight now. Get that money an' there's a tip. He's a good man for the tip an' don't be shovin' it in your pocket like your cousin Gerry. Shoved it in his pocket, the little bugger.\nI bang on the door with the knocker and there's a great howl from a dog so big he makes the door shake. A man's voice says, Macushla, quit the bloody racket or I'll give you a good fong in the arse for yourself. The racket stops, the door opens and the man is there, white hair, thick glasses, white sweater, a stick in his hand. He says, Who is it? Who do we have?\nThe paper, Mr. Timoney.\nWe don't have Ab Sheehan here, do we?\nI'm his nephew, sir.\nIs it Gerry Sheehan we have here?\nNo, sir. I'm Frank McCourt.\nAnother nephew? Does he make them? Is there a little nephew factory\nin the backyard? Here's the money for the fortnight and give me the paper\nor keep it. What's the use? I can't read anymore and Mrs. Minihan that's supposed to read to me didn't come. Legless with the sherry, that's what she is. What's your name?\nFrank, sir.\nCan you read?\nI can, sir.\nDo you want to earn a sixpence?\nI do, sir.\nCome here tomorrow. Your name is Francis, isn't it? Frank, sir.\nYour name is Francis. There was never a St. Frank. That's a name for gangsters and politicians. Come here tomorrow at eleven and read to me.\nI will, sir.\nAre you sure you can read?\nI am, sir.\nYou can call me Mr. Timoney.\nI will, Mr. Timoney.\nUncle Pat is mumbling at the gate, rubbing his leg. Where's me\nmoney an' you're not supposed to be chattin' with the customers an' me here with the leg destroyed be the rain. He has to stop at the pub at Punch's Cross to have a pint for the destroyed leg. After the pint he says he can't walk another inch and we get on a bus. The conductor says, Fares, please, fares, but Uncle Pat says, Go 'way an' don't be botherin' me, can't you see the state o' me leg?\nOh, all right, Ab, all right.\nThe bus stops at the O'Connell Monument and Uncle Pat goes to the Monument Fish and Chip Caf\u00e9 where the smells are so delicious my stomach beats with the hunger. He gets a shilling's worth of fish and chips and my mouth is watering but when we get to Grandma's door he gives me a threepenny bit, tells me meet him again next Friday and go home now to my mother.\nThe dog Macushla is lying outside Mr. Timoney's door and when I open the little garden gate to go up the path she rushes at me and knocks me back out on the pavement and she'd eat my face if Mr. Timoney didn't come out and flail at her with his stick and yell, Come in out of it, ye hoor, ye overgrown man eatin' bitch. Didn't you have your breakfast, you hoor? Are you all right, Francis? Come in. That dog is a right Hindu, so she is, and that's where I found her mother wandering around Bangalore. If ever you're getting a dog, Francis, make sure it's a Buddhist. Good natured dogs, the Buddhists. Never, never get a Mahommedan. They'll eat you sleeping. Never a Catholic dog. They'll eat you every day including Fridays. Sit down and read to me.\nThe Limerick Leader, Mr. Timoney?\nNo, not the bloody Limerick Leader. I wouldn't wipe the hole of my arse with the Limerick Leader. There's a book over there on the table, Gulliver's Travels. That's not what I want you to read. Look in the back for another thing, A Modest Proposal. Read that to me. It begins, It is a melancholy object to those who walk... Do you have that? I have the whole bloody thing in my head but I still want you to read to me.\nHe stops me after two or three pages. You're a good reader. And what do you think of that, Francis, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled, eh? Macushla would love a dinner of a nice plump Irish infant, wouldn't you, you oul' hoor?\nHe gives me sixpence, and tells me return next Saturday.\nMam is delighted I earned sixpence for reading to Mr. Timoney and what was it he wanted read, the Limerick Leader? I tell her I had to read A Modest Proposal from the back of Gulliver's Travels and she says, That's all right, 'tis only a children's book. You'd expect him to want something strange for he's a little off in the head after years in the sun in the English army in India and they say he was married to one of them Indian women and she was accidentally shot by a soldier during some class of a disturbance. That's the kind of thing that would drive you to children's books. She knows this Mrs. Minihan who lives next door to Mr. Timoney and used to clean house but couldn't stand it anymore the way he laughed at the Catholic Church and said one man's sin was another man's romp. Mrs. Minihan didn't mind the odd drop of sherry of a Saturday morning but then he tried to turn her into a Buddhist, which he said he was himself and the Irish would be much better off in general if they sat under a tree and watched the Ten Commandments and the Seven Deadly Sins float down the Shannon and far out to sea.\nThe next Friday Declan Collopy from the Confraternity sees me on the street delivering the papers with my uncle Pat Sheehan. Hoi, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' with Ab Sheehan?\nHe's my uncle.\nYou're supposed to be at the Confraternity.\nI'm working, Declan.\nYou're not supposed to be working. You're not even ten and you're\ndestroyin' the perfect attendance in our section. If you're not there next Friday I'll give you a good thump in the gob, do you hear me?\nUncle Pat says, Go 'way, go 'way, or I'll walk on you.\nAh, shut up, Mr. Stupid that was dropped on your head. He pushes Uncle Pat on the shoulder and knocks him back against the wall. I drop the papers and run at him but he steps aside and punches me on the back of the neck and my forehead is rammed into the wall and it puts me in such a rage I can't see him anymore. I go at him with arms and legs and if I could tear his face off with my teeth I would but he has long arms like a gorilla and he just keeps pushing me away so that I can't touch him. He says, You mad feckin' eejit. I'll destroy you in the Confraternity, and he runs away.\nUncle Pat says, You shouldn't be fightin' like that an' you dropped all me papers an' some o' them is wet an' how am I supposed to sell wet papers, and I wanted to jump on him too and hit him for talking about papers after I stood up to Declan Collopy.\nAt the end of the night he gives me three chips from his bag and sixpence instead of threepence. He complains it's too much money and it's all my mother's fault for going on to Grandma about the low pay.\nMam is delighted I'm getting sixpence on Fridays from Uncle Pat and sixpence on Saturdays from Mr. Timoney. A shilling a week makes a big difference and she gives me tuppence to see the Dead End Kids at the Lyric after I'm finished the reading.\nNext morning Mr. Timoney says, Wait till we get to Gulliver, Francis. You'll know Jonathan Swift is the greatest Irish writer that ever lived, no, the greatest man to put pen to parchment. A giant of a man, Francis. He laughs all through A Modest Proposal and you'd wonder what he's laughing at when it's all about cooking Irish babies. He says, You'll laugh when you grow up, Francis.\nYou're not supposed to talk back to grown-ups but Mr. Timoney is different and he doesn't mind when I say, Mr. Timoney, big people are\nalways telling us that. Oh, you'll laugh when you grow up. You'll understand when you grow up. Everything will come when you grow up.\nHe lets out such a roar of a laugh I think he's going to collapse. Oh, Mother o' God, Francis. You're a treasure. What's up with you? Do you have a bee up your arse? Tell me what's up.\nNothing, Mr. Timoney.\nI think you have the long puss, Francis, and I wish I could Go over to the mirror on the wall, Snow White, and tell me if you the long puss. Never mind. Just tell me what's up.\nDeclan Collopy was at me last night and I got into a fight.\nHe makes me tell him about the Confraternity and Declan and\nuncle Pat Sheehan, who was dropped on his head, and then he tells\nknows my uncle Pa Keating, who was gassed in the war and works in\nworks. He says, Pa Keating is a jewel of a man. And I'll tell you\nI'll do, Francis. I'll talk to Pa Keating and we'll go to the crawthumpers at the Confraternity. I'm a Buddhist myself and I don't hold with fighting but I haven't lost it. They're not going to interfere with my little reader, oh, by Jesus, no.\nMr. Timoney is an old man but he talks like a friend and I can say what I feel. Dad would never talk to me like Mr. Timoney. He'd say, Och, aye, and go for a long walk.\nUncle Pat Sheehan tells Grandma he doesn't want me to help with the papers anymore, he can get another boy much cheaper and he thinks I should be giving him some of my Saturday morning sixpence anyway since I'd never have the reading job without him.\nA woman next door to Mr. Timoney tells me I'm wasting my time knocking on the door, Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun on the same day and Mr. Timoney couldn't stop laughing though he cried when the dog was taken away to be put down. You can bite postmen and milkmen all you like but the case of the passing nun goes all the way to the bishop and he takes steps especially if the owner of the dog is a known Buddhist and a danger to good Catholics around him. Mr. Timoney was told this and cried and laughed so hard the doctor came and said he was gone beyond recall so they carted him off to the City Home, where they keep old people who are helpless or demented.\nThat's the end of my Saturday sixpence but I'll read to Mr. Timoney money or no money. I wait down the street till the woman next door goes in, I climb in Mr. Timoney's window for Gulliver'sTravels and walk miles to the City Home so that he won't miss his reading. The man at the gate says, What? You want to come in an' read to an oul' man? Is it coddin' me you are? Get outa here before I call the guards.\nCould I leave the book for someone else to read to Mr. Timoney? Leave it. Leave it for Jaysus sake an' don't be botherin' me. I'll send it up to him.\nAnd he laughs.\nMam says, What's up with you? Why are you moping? And I tell her how Uncle Pat doesn't want me anymore and how they put Mr. Timoney in the City Home for laughing just because Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun. She laughs too and I'm sure the world is gone mad. Then she says, Ah, I'm sorry and it's a pity you lost two jobs. You might as well start going to the Confraternity again to keep The Posse away and, worse, the director, Father Gorey.\nDeclan tells me sit in front of him and if there's any blaguarding he'll break my feckin' neck for he'll be watching me as long as he's\nsee it. have\nmy\nme he\nthe gas\nwhat\nprefect and no little shit like me is going to keep him from a life in linoleum.\nMam says she has trouble climbing the stairs and she's moving her bed to the kitchen. She laughs, I'll come back up to Sorrento when the walls are damp and the rain runs under the door. School is over and she can stay in bed in the kitchen as long as she likes because she doesn't have to get up for us. Dad lights the fire, makes the tea, cuts the bread, makes sure we wash our faces and tells us go out and play. He lets us stay in bed if we like but you never want to stay in bed when there's no school. We're ready to run out and play in the lane the minute we wake.\nThen one day in July he says we can't go downstairs. We have to stay up here and play.\nWhy, Dad?\nNever mind. Play here with Malachy and Michael and you can go down later when I tell you.\nHe stands at the door in case we might get a notion to wander down the stairs. We push our blanket up in the air with our feet and pretend we're in a tent, Robin Hood and his Merry Men. We hunt fleas and squash them between our thumbnails.\nThen there's a baby's cry and Malachy says, Dad, did Mam get a new\nbaby?\nOch, aye, son.\nI'm older so I tell Malachy the bed is in the kitchen so that the angel can fly down and leave the baby on the seventh step but Malachy doesn't understand because he's only eight going on nine and I'll be ten next month.\nMam is in the bed with the new baby. He has a big fat face and he's red all over. There's a woman in the kitchen in a nurse's uniform and we know she's there to wash new babies who are always dirty from the long journey with the angel. We want to tickle the baby but she says, No, no, ye can look at him but don't lay a finger.\nDon't lay a finger. That's the way nurses talk.\nWe sit at the table with our tea and bread looking at our new brother but he won't even open his eyes to look back at us so we go out and play.\nIn a few days Mam is out of the bed holding the baby on her lap by the fire. His eyes are open and when we tickle him he makes a gurgling sound, his belly shakes and that makes us laugh. Dad tickles him and sings a Scottish song, Oh, oh, stop your ticklin', Jock, Stop your ticklin', Jock.\nStop your ticklin',\nIckle ickle icklin\nStop your ticklin', Jock.\nDad has a job so Bridey Hannon is able to visit Mam and the baby any time she likes and for once Mam doesn't tell us go out and play so they can talk about secret things. They sit by the fire smoking and talking about names. Mam says she likes the names Kevin and Sean but Bridey says, Ah, no, there's too many of them in Limerick. Jesus, Angela, if you stuck your head out the door and called, Kevin or Sean, come in for your tea, you'd have half o' Limerick running to your door.\nBridey says if she had a son which please God she will some day she'll call him Ronald because she's mad about Ronald Colman that you see in the Coliseum Cinema. Or Errol, now that's another lovely name, Errol Flynn.\nMam says, Will you go way outa that, Bridey. I'd never be able to stick my head out the door and say, Errol, Errol, come in for your tea. Sure the poor child would be a laughingstock.\nRonald, says Bridey, Ronald. He's gorgeous.\nNo, says Mam, it has to be Irish. Isn't that what we fought for all these years? What's the use of fighting the English for centuries if we're going to call our children Ronald?\nJesus, Angela, you're starting to talk like himself with his Irish this and his English that.\nStill an' all, Bridey, he's right.\nSuddenly Bridey is gasping, Jesus, Angela, there's something wrong with that child. Mam is out of the chair, hugging the child, moaning. Oh, Jesus, Bridey, he's choking.\nBridey says, I'll run for my mother, and she's back in a minute with Mrs. Hannon. Castor oil, says Mrs. Hannon. Do you have it? Any oil. Cod liver oil? That'll do.\nShe pours the oil into the baby's mouth, turns him over, presses on his back, turns him back over, sticks a spoon down his throat and brings up a white ball. That's it now, she says. The milk. It collects and gets hard in their little throats so you have to ease it with any class of an oil.\nMam is crying, Jesus, I nearly lost him. Oh, I'd die so I would.\nShe's clutching the baby and crying and trying to thank Mrs. Hannon.\nYerra, don't mention it, missus. Take the child and get back into that bed for the two o' ye had a great shock.\nWhile Bridey and Mrs. Hannon are helping Mam to the bed I notice spots of blood on her chair. Is my mother bleeding to death? Is it all right to say, Look, there's blood on Mam's chair? No, you can't say anything because they always have secrets. I know if you say anything the grown-up people will tell you, Never mind, you're always gawking, none of your business, go out and play.\nI have to keep it inside or I can talk to the angel. Mrs. Hannon and Bridey leave and I sit on the seventh step. I try to tell the angel Mam is bleeding to death. I want him to tell me, Fear not, but the step is cold and there's no light, no voice. I'm sure he's gone forever and I wonder if that happens when you go from nine to ten.\nMam doesn't bleed to death. She's out of the bed next day getting the baby ready for baptism, telling Bridey she could never forgive herself if the baby died and went to Limbo, a place for unbaptized babies, where it may be nice and warm but, still, dark forever and no hope of escape even on the Judgment Day.\nGrandma is there to help and she says, That's right, no hope in heaven for the infant that's not baptized.\nBridey says it would be a hard God that would do the likes of that.\nHe has to be hard, says Grandma, otherwise you'd have all kinds of babies clamorin' to get into heaven, Protestants an' everything, an' why should they get in after what they did to us for eight hundred years?\nThe babies didn't do it, says Bridey. They're too small.\nThey would if they got the chance, says Grandma. They're trained for it.\nThey dress the baby in the Limerick lace dress we were all baptized in. Mam says we can all go to St. Joseph's and we're excited because there will be lemonade and buns after.\nMalachy says, Mam, what's the baby's name?\nAlphonsus Joseph.\nThe words fly out of my mouth, That's a stupid name. It's not even\nIrish.\nGrandma glares at me with her old red eyes. She says, That fella\nneeds a good clitther on the gob. Mam slaps me across the face and sends me flying across the kitchen. My heart is pounding and I want to cry but I can't because my father isn't there and I'm the man of the family. Mam says, You go upstairs with your big mouth and don't move from that room.\nI stop at the seventh step but it's still cold, no light, no voice.\nThe house is quiet with everyone gone to the chapel. I sit and wait upstairs, knocking the fleas off my arms and legs, wishing I had Dad here, thinking of my little brother and his foreign name, Alphonsus, an affliction of a name.\nIn awhile there are voices downstairs and there is talk of tea, sherry, lemonade, buns, and isn't that child the loveliest little fella in the world, little Alphie, foreign name but still an' all still an' all not a sound outa him the whole time he's that good-natured God bless him sure he'll live forever with the sweetness that's in him the little dote spittin' image of his mother his father his grandma his little brothers dead an' gone.\nMam calls from the bottom of the stairs, Frank, come down and have lemonade and a bun.\nI don't want it. You can keep it.\nI said come down this minute for if I have to climb these stairs I'll warm your behind and you'll rue the day.\nRue? What's rue?\nNever mind what's rue. Come down here at once.\nHer voice is sharp and rue sounds dangerous. I'll go down.\nIn the kitchen Grandma says, Look at the long puss on him. You'd\nthink he'd be happy for his little brother except that a boy that's going from nine to ten is always a right pain in the arse an' I know for didn't I have two of 'em.\nThe lemonade and bun are delicious and Alphie the new baby is chirping away enjoying his baptism day too innocent to know his name is an affliction.\nGrandpa in the North sends a telegram money order for five pounds for the baby Alphie. Mam wants to cash it but she can't go far from the bed. Dad says he'll cash it at the post office. She tells Malachy and me to go with him. He cashes it and tells us, All right, boys, go home and tell your mother I'll be home in a few minutes.\nMalachy says, Dad, you're not to go to the pub. Mam said you're to bring home the money. You're not to drink the pint.\nNow, now, son. Go home to your mother. Dad, give us the money. That money is for the baby.\nNow, Francis, don't be a bad boy. Do what your father tells you.\nHe walks away from us and into South's pub. Mam is sitting by the fireplace with Alphie in her arms. She shakes her head. He went to the pub, didn't he? He did. I want ye to go back down to that pub and read\nhim out of it. I want ye to stand in the middle of the pub and tell every man your father is drinking the money for the baby. Ye are to tell the world there isn't a scrap of food in this house, not a lump of coal to start the fire, not a drop of milk for the baby's bottle.\nWe walk through the streets and Malachy practices his speech at the top of his voice, Dad, Dad, that five pounds is for the new baby. That's not for the drink. The child is above in the bed bawling and roaring for his milk and you're drinking the pint.\nHe's gone from South's pub. Malachy still wants to stand and make his speech but I tell him we have to hurry and look in other pubs before Dad drinks the whole five pounds. We can't find him in other pubs either. He knows Mam would come for him or send us and there are so many pubs at this end of Limerick and beyond we could be looking for a month. We have to tell Mam there's no sign of him and she tells us we're pure useless. Oh, Jesus, I wish I had my strength and I'd search every pub in Limerick. I'd tear the mouth out of his head, so I would. Go on, go back down and try all the pubs around the railway station and try Naughton's fish and chip shop.\nI have to go by myself because Malachy has the runs and can't stray far from the bucket. I search all the pubs on Parnell Street and around. I look into the snugs where the women drink and in all the men's lavatories. I'm hungry but I'm afraid to go home till I find my father. He's not in Naughton's fish and chip shop but there's a drunken man asleep at a table in the corner and his fish and chips are on the floor in their Limerick Leader wrapping and if I don't get them the cat will so I shove them under my jersey and I'm out the door and up the street to sit on the steps at the railway station eat my fish and chips watch the drunken soldiers pass by with the girls that giggle thank the drunken man in my mind for drowning the fish and chips in vinegar and smothering them in salt and then remember that if I die tonight I'm in a state of sin for stealing and I could go straight to hell stuffed with fish and chips but it's Saturday and if the priests are still in the confession boxes I can clear my soul after my feed.\nThe Dominican church is just up Glentworth Street.\nBless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession. I tell him the usual sins and then, I stole fish and chips from a drunken man.\nWhy, my child?\nI was hungry, Father.\nAnd why were you hungry?\nThere was nothing in my belly, Father.\nHe says nothing and even though it's dark I know he's shaking his\nhead. My dear child, why can't you go home and ask your mother for something? Because she sent me out looking for my father in the pubs, Father, and I couldn't find him and she hasn't a scrap in the house because he's drinking the five pounds Grandpa sent from the North for the new baby and she's raging by the fire because I can't find my father.\nI wonder if this priest is asleep because he's very quiet till he says, My child, I sit here. I hear the sins of the poor. I assign the penance. I bestow absolution. I should be on my knees washing their feet. Do you understand me, my child?\nI tell him I do but I don't.\nGo home, child. Pray for me.\nNo penance, Father?\nNo, my child.\nI stole the fish and chips. I'm doomed.\nYou're forgiven. Go. Pray for me. He blesses me in Latin, talks to\nhimself in English and I wonder what I did to him. I wish I could find my father so I could say to Mam, Here he is and he has three pounds left in his pocket. I'm not hungry now so I can go up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and search pubs on the side streets and there he is in Gleeson's, how could I miss him with his singing, 'Tis alone my concern if the grandest surprise Would be shining at me out of somebody's eyes.\n'Tis my private affair what my feelings would be While the Green Glens of Antrim were welcoming me.\nMy heart is banging away in my chest and I don't know what to do because I know I'm raging inside like my mother by the fire and all I can think of doing is running in and giving him a good kick in the leg and running out again but I don't because we have the mornings by the fire when he tells me about Cuchulain and De Valera and Roosevelt and if he's there drunk and buying pints with the baby's money he has that look in his eyes Eugene had when he searched for Oliver and I might as well go home and tell my mother a lie that I never saw him couldn't find him.\nShe's in the bed with the baby. Malachy and Michael are up in Italy asleep. I know I don't have to tell Mam anything, that soon when the pubs close he'll be home singing and offering us a penny to die for Ireland and it will be different now because it's bad enough to drink the dole or the wages but a man that drinks the money for a new baby is gone beyond the beyonds as my mother would say.\nVIII\nI'm ten years old and ready to go to St. Joseph's Church for my Confirmation. In school the master, Mr. O'Dea, prepares us. We have to know all about Sanctifying Grace, a pearl of great price, bought for us by Jesus in His dying. Mr. O'Dea's eyes roll in his head when he tells us that with Confirmation we will become part of Divinity. We will have the Gifts of the Holy Ghost: Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, the Fear of the Lord. Priests and masters tell us Confirmation means you're a true soldier of the Church and that entitles you to die and be a martyr in case we're invaded by Protestants or Mahommedans or any other class of a heathen. More dying. I want to tell them I won't be able to die for the Faith because I'm already booked to die for Ireland.\nMikey Molloy says, Is it jokin' you are? That thing about dying for the Faith is all a cod. 'Tis only a saying they made up to frighten you. Ireland too. No one dies for anything anymore. All the dying is done. I wouldn't die for Ireland or the Faith. I might die for my mother but that's all.\nMikey knows everything. He's going on fourteen. He gets the fits. He has visions.\nThe grown-ups tell us it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith, only we're not ready for that yet because Confirmation day is like First Communion day, you make the rounds of lanes and back streets and you get cakes and sweets and money, The Collection.\nThat's where poor Peter Dooley comes in. We call him Quasimodo because he has a hump on his back like the one on the hunchback of Notre Dame, whose real name we know is Charles Laughton.\nQuasimodo has nine sisters and it is said his mother never wanted him but that was what the angel brought her and it's a sin to question what's sent. Quasimodo is old, he's fifteen. His red hair sticks up in all directions. He has green eyes and one rolls around in his head so much he's constantly tapping his temple to keep it where it's supposed to be. His right leg is short and twisted and when he walks he does a little twirly dance and you never know when he'll fall. That's when you're surprised. He curses his leg, he curses the world, but he curses in a lovely English accent which he got from the radio, the BBC. Before he leaves his house he always sticks his head out the door and tells the lane, Here's me head, me arse is coming. When he was twelve Quasimodo decided that with the way he looked and the way the world looked at him the best thing would be to prepare for a job where he could be heard and not seen and what better than sitting behind a microphone at the BBC in London reading the news?\nBut you can't get to London without money and that's why he hobbles up to us that Friday, the day before Confirmation. He has an idea for Billy and me. He knows the next day we'll be getting Confirmation money and if we promise to pay him a shilling each he'll let us climb up the rainspout behind his house this very night to look in the window and see his sisters' naked bodies when they take their weekly wash. I sign right away. Billy says, I have my own sister. Why should I pay to see your naked sisters?\nQuasimodo says that looking at your own sister's naked body is the worst sin of all and he's not sure if there's a priest in the world can forgive you, that you might have to go to the bishop, who everyone knows is a holy terror.\nBilly signs.\nFriday night we climb the wall of Quasimodo's backyard. It's a lovely night with the June moon floating high over Limerick and you can feel a warm breeze off the Shannon River. Quasimodo is about to let Billy up the spout and who comes clambering over the wall but Mikey Molloy the Fit himself hissing at Quasimodo, Here's a shilling, Quasimodo. Let me up the spout. Mikey is fourteen now, bigger than any of us and strong from his job delivering coal. He's black from the coal like Uncle Pa Keating and all you can see are the whites of his eyes and the white froth on his lower lip, which means he could have the fit anytime.\nQuasimodo says, Wait, Mikey. They're first. Wait, my arse, says Mikey, and he's away up the spout. Billy complains but Quasimodo shakes his head, I can't help it. He comes every week with the shilling. I have to let him up the spout or he'll beat me up and tell my mother and the next thing she locks me in the coal hole all day with the rats. The Fit is up hanging on to the spout with one hand. The other hand is in his pocket moving, moving and when the spout itself starts to move and creak Quasimodo hisses, Molloy, there's to be no whankin' up the spout. He hops around the yard cackling. His BBC accent is gone and he's pure Limerick. Jaysus, Molloy, come down off that spout or I'll tell me mother. Mikey's hand goes faster in his pocket, so fast the spout gives a lurch and collapses and Mikey is rolling on the ground yelping, I'm dead. I'm destroyed. Oh, God. You can see the froth on his lips and the blood that comes from biting his tongue.\nQuasimodo's mother comes screaming through the door, What in the name of Jesus! and the kitchen light fills the yard. The sisters are squawking from the window above. Billy tries to escape and she drags him off the wall. She tells him run to O'Connor the chemist around the corner to ring up an ambulance or a doctor or something for Mikey. She screams at us to get into the kitchen. She kicks Quasimodo into the hall. He's on his hands and knees and she drags him to the coal hole under the stairs and locks him in. Stay there till you come to your senses.\nHe's crying and calling to her in a pure Limerick accent. Ah, Mamma, Mamma, let me out. The rats is here. I only want to go to the BBC, Mamma. Aw, Jasus, Mamma, Jasus. I'll never let anyone up the spout again. I'll send money from London, Mamma. Mamma!\nMikey is still on his back, jerking and twisting around the yard. The ambulance takes him off to the hospital with a broken shoulder and his tongue in ribbons.\nOur mothers are there in no time. Mrs. Dooley says, I'm disgraced, so I am, disgraced. My daughters can't wash theirselves of a Friday night without the whole world gawking in the window and them boys there are in a state of sin and should be taken to the priest for confession before their Confirmation tomorrow.\nBut Mam says, I don't know about the rest of the world but I saved a whole year for Frank's Confirmation suit and I'm not going to the priest to have him tell me my son is not fit for Confirmation so that I'll have to wait another year when he grows out of this suit and all because he climbed a spout for an innocent gawk at the scrawny arse of Mona Dooley.\nShe drags me home by the ear and makes me kneel before the Pope. Swear, she says, swear to that Pope that you didn't look at Mona Dooley in her pelt.\nI swear.\nIf you're lying you won't be in a state of grace for Confirmation tomorrow and that's the worst kind of sacrilege.\nI swear.\nOnly the bishop himself could forgive a sacrilege like that.\nI swear.\nAll right. Go to bed and from this day out stay far away from that\nmisfortunate Quasimodo Dooley.\nWe are all confirmed the next day. The bishop asks me a catechism\nquestion, What is the Fourth Commandment? and I tell him, Honor thy father and thy mother. He pats my cheek and that makes me a soldier of the True Church. I kneel in the pew and think of Quasimodo locked in the coal hole under the stairs and I wonder, Should I give him the shilling anyway for his career at the BBC?\nBut I forget all about Quasimodo because my nose starts bleeding and I feel dizzy. Confirmation boys and girls are outside St. Joseph's with their parents and there is hugging and kissing in the bright sun and I don't care. My father is working and I don't care. My mother kisses me and I don't care. The boys talk about The Collection and I don't care. My nose won't stop and Mam is worried I'll ruin my suit. She runs into the church to see if Stephen Carey, the sacristan, would spare her a rag and he gives her some kind of canvas cloth that makes my nose sore. She says, Do you want to make your collection? and I tell her I don't care. Malachy says, Do, do, Frankie, and he's sad because I promised I'd take him to the Lyric Cinema to see the film and stuff ourselves with sweets. I want\nto lie down. I could lie down there on the steps of St. Joseph's and sleep forever. Mam says, Grandma is making a nice breakfast, and the mention of food makes me so sick I run to the edge of the pavement to throw up and the whole world is looking at me and I don't care. Mam says she'd better take me home and put me to bed and my pals look surprised that anyone can go to bed when there's a collection to be made.\nShe helps me take off my Confirmation suit and puts me to bed. She wets a rag and places it under my neck and after awhile the bleeding stops. She brings tea but the look of it makes me sick and I have to throw up in the bucket. Mrs. Hannon comes in from next door and I can hear her say that's a very sick child and he should have a doctor. Mam says it's Saturday, the Dispensary is closed and where would you get a doctor?\nDad comes home from his job at Rank's Flour Mills and tells Mam I'm going through a stage, growing pains. Grandma comes up and says the same thing. She says when boys go from the one number year, which is nine, to the two number year, which is ten, they're changing and prone to the nosebleed. She says I might have too much blood in me anyway and a good cleaning out wouldn't do me one bit of harm.\nThe day passes and I'm in and out of sleep. Malachy and Michael come into the bed at night and I can hear Malachy say, Frankie is very hot. Michael says, He's bleeding on my leg. Mam puts the wet rag on my nose and a key on my neck but it won't stop the bleeding. On Sunday morning there's blood on my chest and all around me. Mam tells Dad I'm bleeding through my bottom and he says I might have a case of the runs, which is common with the growing pains.\nDr. Troy is our doctor but he's away on holiday and the man that comes to see me on Monday has a smell of whiskey on him. He examines me and tells my mother I have a bad cold and keep me in bed. Days pass and I sleep and bleed. Mam makes tea and beef tea and I don't want it. She even brings ice cream and the look of it makes me sick. Mrs. Hannon comes in again and says that doctor doesn't know what he's talking about, see if Dr. Troy is back.\nMam comes with Dr. Troy. He feels my forehead, rolls up my eyelids, turns me over to see my back, picks me up and runs to his motor car. Mam runs after him and he tells her I have typhoid fever. Mam cries, Oh, God, oh, God, am I to lose the whole family? Will it ever end? She gets into the car, holds me in her lap and moans all the way to the Fever Hospital at the City Home.\nThe bed has cool white sheets. The nurses have clean white uniforms and the nun, Sister Rita, is all in white. Dr. Humphrey and Dr. Campbell have white coats and things hanging from their necks which they stick against my chest and all over. I sleep and sleep but I'm awake when they bring in jars of bright red stuff that hang from tall poles above my bed and they stick tubes into my ankles and the back of my right hand. Sister Rita says, You're getting blood, Francis. Soldier's blood from the Sarsfield Barracks.\nMam is sitting by the bed and the nurse is saying, You know, missus, this is very unusual. No one is ever allowed into the Fever Hospital for fear they'd catch something but they made an exception for you with his crisis coming. If he gets over this he'll surely recover.\nI fall asleep. Mam is gone when I wake but there's movement in the room and it's the priest, Father Gorey, from the Confraternity saying Mass at a table in the corner. I drift off again and now they're waking\nme and pulling down the bedclothes. Father Gorey is touching me with oil and praying in Latin. I know it's Extreme Unction and that means I'm going to die and I don't care. They wake me again to receive Communion. I don't want it, I'm afraid I might get sick. I keep the wafer on my tongue and fall asleep and when I wake up again it's gone.\nIt's dark and Dr. Campbell is sitting by my bed. He's holding my wrist and looking at his watch. He has red hair and glasses and he always smiles when he talks to me. He sits now and hums and looks out the window. His eyes close and he snores a little. He tilts over on the chair and farts and smiles to himself and I know now I'm going to get better because a doctor would never fart in the presence of a dying boy.\nSister Rita's white habit is bright in the sun that comes in the window. She's holding my wrist, looking at her watch, smiling. Oh, she says, we're awake, are we? Well, Francis, I think we've come through the worst. Our prayers are answered and all the prayers of those hundreds of little boys at the Confraternity. Can you imagine that? Hundreds of boys saying the rosary for you and offering up their communion.\nMy ankles and the back of my hand are throbbing from the tubes bringing in the blood and I don't care about boys praying for me. I can hear the swish of Sister Rita's habit and the click of her rosary beads when she leaves the room. I fall asleep and when I wake it's dark and Dad is sitting by the bed with his hand on mine.\nSon, are you awake?\nI try to talk but I'm dry, nothing will come out and I point to my mouth. He holds a glass of water to my lips and it's sweet and cool. He presses my hand and says I'm a great old soldier and why wouldn't I? Don't I have the soldier's blood in me?\nThe tubes are not in me anymore and the glass jars are gone.\nSister Rita comes in and tells Dad he has to go. I don't want him to go because he looks sad. He's like Paddy Clohessy the day I gave him the raisin. When he looks sad it's the worst thing in the world and I start crying. Now what's this? says Sister Rita. Crying with all that soldier blood in you? There's a big surprise for you tomorrow, Francis. You'll never guess. Well, I'll tell you, we're bringing you a nice biscuit with your tea in the morning. Isn't that a treat? And your father will be back in a day or two, won't you, Mr. McCourt?\nDad nods and puts his hand on mine again. He looks at me, steps away, stops, comes back, kisses me on the forehead for the first time in my life and I'm so happy I feel like floating out of the bed.\nThe other two beds in my room are empty. The nurse says I'm the only typhoid patient and I'm a miracle for getting over the crisis.\nThe room next to me is empty till one morning a girl's voice says, Yoo hoo, who's there?\nI'm not sure if she's talking to me or someone in the room beyond. Yoo hoo, boy with the typhoid, are you awake?\nI am.\nAre you better?\nI am.\nWell, why are you here?\nI don't know. I'm still in the bed. They stick needles in me and\ngive me medicine.\nWhat do you look like?\nI wonder, What kind of a question is that? I don't know what to tell her.\nYoo hoo, are you there, typhoid boy?\nI am.\nWhat's your name?\nFrank.\nThat's a good name. My name is Patricia Madigan. How old are you? Ten. Oh. She sounds disappointed.\nBut I'll be eleven in August, next month.\nWell, that's better than ten. I'll be fourteen in September. Do you\nwant to know why I'm in the Fever Hospital? I do.\nI have diphtheria and something else.\nWhat's something else?\nThey don't know. They think I have a disease from foreign parts\nbecause my father used to be in Africa. I nearly died. Are you going to tell me what you look like?\nI have black hair.\nYou and millions.\nI have brown eyes with bits of green that's called hazel.\nYou and thousands.\nI have stitches on the back of my right hand and my two feet where\nthey put in the soldier's blood.\nOh, God, did they?\nThey did.\nYou won't be able to stop marching and saluting.\nThere's a swish of habit and click of beads and then Sister Rita's\nvoice. Now, now, what's this? There's to be no talking between two rooms especially when it's a boy and a girl. Do you hear me, Patricia?\nI do, Sister.\nDo you hear me, Francis?\nI do, Sister.\nYou could be giving thanks for your two remarkable recoveries. You\ncould be saying the rosary. You could be reading The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart that's beside your beds. Don't let me come back and find you talking.\nShe comes into my room and wags her finger at me. Especially you, Francis, after thousands of boys prayed for you at the Confraternity. Give thanks, Francis, give thanks.\nShe leaves and there's silence for awhile. Then Patricia whispers, Give thanks, Francis, give thanks, and say your rosary, Francis, and I laugh so hard a nurse runs in to see if I'm all right. She's a very stern nurse from the County Kerry and she frightens me. What's this, Francis? Laughing? What is there to laugh about? Are you and that Madigan girl talking? I'll report you to Sister Rita. There's to be no laughing for you could be doing serious damage to your internal apparatus.\nShe plods out and Patricia whispers again in a heavy Kerry accent, No laughing, Francis, you could be doin' serious damage to your internal apparatus. Say your rosary, Francis, and pray for your internal apparatus.\nMam visits me on Thursdays. I'd like to see my father, too, but I'm out of danger, crisis time is over, and I'm allowed only one visitor. Besides, she says, he's back at work at Rank's Flour Mills and please God this job will last a while with the war on and the English desperate for flour. She brings me a chocolate bar and that proves Dad is working. She could never afford it on the dole. He sends me notes. He tells me my\nbrothers are all praying for me, that I should be a good boy, obey the doctors, the nuns, the nurses, and don't forget to say my prayers. He's sure St. Jude pulled me through the crisis because he's the patron saint of desperate cases and I was indeed a desperate case.\nPatricia says she has two books by her bed. One is a poetry book and that's the one she loves. The other is a short history of England and do I want it? She gives it to Seamus, the man who mops the floors every day, and he brings it to me. He says, I'm not supposed to be bringing anything from a dipteria room to a typhoid room with all the germs flying around and hiding between the pages and if you ever catch dipteria on top of the typhoid they'll know and I'll lose my good job and be out on the street singing patriotic songs with a tin cup in my hand, which I could easily do because there isn't a song ever written about Ireland's sufferings I don't know and a few songs about the joy of whiskey too.\nOh, yes, he knows Roddy McCorley. He'll sing it for me right enough but he's barely into the first verse when the Kerry nurse rushes in. What's this, Seamus? Singing? Of all the people in this hospital you should know the rules against singing. I have a good mind to report you to Sister Rita.\nAh, God, don't do that, nurse.\nVery well, Seamus. I'll let it go this one time. You know the singing could lead to a relapse in these patients.\nWhen she leaves he whispers he'll teach me a few songs because singing is good for passing the time when you're by yourself in a typhoid room. He says Patricia is a lovely girl the way she often gives him sweets from the parcel her mother sends every fortnight. He stops mopping the floor and calls to Patricia in the next room, I was telling Frankie you're a lovely girl, Patricia, and she says, You're a lovely man, Seamus. He smiles because he's an old man of forty and he never had children but the ones he can talk to here in the Fever Hospital. He says, Here's the book, Frankie. Isn't it a great pity you have to be reading all about England after all they did to us, that there isn't a history of Ireland to be had in this hospital.\nThe book tells me all about King Alfred and William the Conqueror and all the kings and queens down to Edward, who had to wait forever for his mother, Victoria, to die before he could be king. The book has the first bit of Shakespeare I ever read.\nI do believe, induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy.\nThe history writer says this is what Catherine, who is a wife of Henry the Eighth, says to Cardinal Wolsey, who is trying to have her head cut off. I don't know what it means and I don't care because it's Shakespeare and it's like having jewels in my mouth when I say the words. If I had a whole book of Shakespeare they could keep me in the hospital for a year.\nPatricia says she doesn't know what induced means or potent circumstances and she doesn't care about Shakespeare, she has her poetry book and she reads to me from beyond the wall a poem about an owl and a pussycat that went to sea in a green boat with honey and money and it makes no sense and when I say that Patricia gets huffy and says that's the last poem she'll ever read to me. She says I'm always reciting the lines from Shakespeare and they make no sense either. Seamus stops mopping again and tells us we shouldn't be fighting over poetry because we'll have enough to fight about when we grow up and get married.\nPatricia says she's sorry and I'm sorry too so she reads me part of another poem which I have to remember so I can say it back to her early in the morning or late at night when there are no nuns or nurses about, The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees, The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, And the highwayman came riding Riding riding The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn door.\nHe'd a French cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,\nA coat of the claret velvet,\nand breeches of brown doe skin,\nThey fitted with never a wrinkle,\nhis boots were up to the thigh.\nAnd he rode with a jewelled twinkle,\nHis pistol butts a-twinkle,\nHis rapier hilt a-twinkle,\nunder the jewelled sky.\nEvery day I can't wait for the doctors and nurses to leave me alone so I can learn a new verse from Patricia and find out what's happening to the highwayman and the landlord's red lipped daughter. I love the poem because it's exciting and almost as good as my two lines of Shakespeare. The redcoats are after the highwayman because they know he told her, I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.\nI'd love to do that myself, come by moonlight for Patricia in the next room not giving a fiddler's fart though hell should bar the way. She's ready to read the last few verses when in comes the nurse from Kerry shouting at her, shouting at me, I told ye there was to be no talking between rooms. Dipthteria is never allowed to talk to typhoid and visa versa. I warned ye. And she calls out, Seamus, take this one. Take the by. Sister Rita said one more word out of him and upstairs with him. We gave ye a warning to stop the blathering but ye wouldn't. Take the by, Seamus, take him.\nAh, now, nurse, sure isn't he harmless. 'Tis only a bit o' poetry. Take that by, Seamus, take him at once.\nHe bends over me and whispers, Ah, God, I'm sorry, Frankie. Here's\nyour English history book. He slips the book under my shirt and lifts me from the bed. He whispers that I'm a feather. I try to see Patricia when we pass through her room but all I can make out is a blur of dark head on a pillow.\nSister Rita stops us in the hall to tell me I'm a great disappointment to her, that she expected me to be a good boy after what God had done for me, after all the prayers said by hundreds of boys at the Confraternity, after all the care from the nuns and nurses of the Fever Hospital, after the way they let my mother and father in to see me, a thing rarely allowed, and this is how I repaid them lying in the bed reciting silly poetry back and forth with Patricia Madigan knowing very well there was a ban on all talk between typhoid and diphtheria. She says I'll have plenty of time to reflect on my sins in the big ward upstairs and I should beg God's forgiveness for my disobedience reciting a pagan English poem about a thief on a horse and a maiden with red lips who commits a terrible sin when I could have been praying or reading the life\nof a saint. She made it her business to read that poem so she did and I'd be well advised to tell the priest in confession.\nThe Kerry nurse follows us upstairs gasping and holding on to the banister. She tells me I better not get the notion she'll be running up to this part of the world every time I have a little pain or a twinge.\nThere are twenty beds in the ward, all white, all empty. The nurse tells Seamus put me at the far end of the ward against the wall to make sure I don't talk to anyone who might be passing the door, which is very unlikely since there isn't another soul on this whole floor. She tells Seamus this was the fever ward during the Great Famine long ago and only God knows how many died here brought in too late for anything but a wash before they were buried and there are stories of cries and moans in the far reaches of the night. She says 'twould break your heart to think of what the English did to us, that if they didn't put the blight on the potato they didn't do much to take it off. No pity. No feeling at all for the people that died in this very ward, children suffering and dying here while the English feasted on roast beef and guzzled the best of wine in their big houses, little children with their mouths all green from trying to eat the grass in the fields beyond, God bless us and save us and guard us from future famines.\nSeamus says 'twas a terrible thing indeed and he wouldn't want to be walking these halls in the dark with all the little green mouths gaping at him. The nurse takes my temperature, 'Tis up a bit, have a good sleep for yourself now that you're away from the chatter with Patricia Madigan below who will never know a gray hair.\nShe shakes her head at Seamus and he gives her a sad shake back.\nNurses and nuns never think you know what they're talking about. If you're ten going on eleven you're supposed to be simple like my uncle Pat Sheehan who was dropped on his head. You can't ask questions. You can't show you understand what the nurse said about Patricia Madigan, that she's going to die, and you can't show you want to cry over this girl who taught you a lovely poem which the nun says is bad.\nThe nurse tells Seamus she has to go and he's to sweep the lint from under my bed and mop up a bit around the ward. Seamus tells me she's a right oul' bitch for running to Sister Rita and complaining about the poem going between the two rooms, that you can't catch a disease from a poem unless it's love ha ha and that's not bloody likely when you're what? ten going on eleven? He never heard the likes of it, a little fella shifted upstairs for saying a poem and he has a good mind to go to the Limerick Leader and tell them print the whole thing except he has this job and he'd lose it if ever Sister Rita found out. Anyway, Frankie, you'll be outa here one of these fine days and you can read all the poetry you want though I don't know about Patricia below, I don't know about Patricia, God help us.\nHe knows about Patricia in two days because she got out of the bed to go to the lavatory when she was supposed to use a bedpan and collapsed and died in the lavatory. Seamus is mopping the floor and there are tears on his cheeks and he's saying, 'Tis a dirty rotten thing to die in a lavatory when you're lovely in yourself. She told me she was sorry she had you reciting that poem and getting you shifted from the room, Frankie. She said 'twas all her fault.\nIt wasn't, Seamus.\nI know and didn't I tell her that.\nPatricia is gone and I'll never know what happened to the highwayman and Bess, the landlord's daughter. I ask Seamus but he doesn't know any poetry at all especially English poetry. He knew an Irish poem once but it was about fairies and had no sign of a highwayman in it. Still he'll ask the men in his local pub where there's always someone reciting something and he'll bring it back to me. Won't I be busy meanwhile reading my short history of England and finding out all\ntheir perfidy. That's what Seamus says, perfidy, and I don't know\nmeans and he doesn't know what it means but if it's something the\ndo it must be terrible.\nHe comes three times a week to mop the floor and the nurse is there every morning to take my temperature and pulse. The doctor listens to my chest with the thing hanging from his neck. They all say, And how's our little soldier today? A girl with a blue dress brings meals three times a day and never talks to me. Seamus says she's not right in the head so don't say a word to her.\nThe July days are long and I fear the dark. There are only two ceiling lights in the ward and they're switched off when the tea tray is taken away and the nurse gives me pills. The nurse tells me go to sleep but I can't because I see people in the nineteen beds in the ward all dying and green around their mouths where they tried to eat grass and moaning for soup Protestant soup any soup and I cover my face with the pillow hoping they won't come and stand around the bed clawing at me and howling for bits of the chocolate bar my mother brought last week.\nNo, she didn't bring it. She had to send it in because I can't have any more visitors. Sister Rita tells me a visit to the Fever Hospital is a privilege and after my bad behavior with Patricia Madigan and that poem I can't have the privilege anymore. She says I'll be going home in a few weeks and my job is to concentrate on getting better and learn to walk again after being in bed for six weeks and I can get out of bed tomorrow after breakfast. I don't know why she says I have to learn how to walk when I've been walking since I was a baby but when the nurse stands me by the side of the bed I fall to the floor and the nurse laughs, See, you're a baby again.\nI practice walking from bed to bed back and forth back and forth. I don't want to be a baby. I don't want to be in this empty ward with no Patricia and no highwayman and no red lipped landlord's daughter. I don't want the ghosts of children with green mouths pointing bony fingers at me and clamoring for bits of my chocolate bar.\nSeamus says a man in his pub knew all the verses of the highwayman poem and it has a very sad end. Would I like him to say it because he never learned how to read and he had to carry the poem in his head? He stands in the middle of the ward leaning on his mop and recites, Tlot- tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot in the echoing night!\nNearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!\nHer eyes grew wide for a moment, she drew one last deep breath, Then her finger moved in the moonlight, Her musket shattered the moonlight, Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him-with her death.\nHe hears the shot and escapes but when he learns at dawn how Bess died he goes into a rage and returns for revenge only to be shot down by the redcoats.\nBlood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine red was his velvet coat, When they shot him down on the highway, Down like a dog on\nabout\nwhat it\nEnglish\nthe highway, And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.\nSeamus wipes his sleeve across his face and sniffles. He says, There was no call at all to shift you up here away from Patricia when you didn't even know what happened to the highwayman and Bess. 'Tis a very sad story and when I said it to my wife she wouldn't stop crying the whole night till we went to bed. She said there was no call for them redcoats to shoot that highwayman, they are responsible for half the troubles of the world and they never had any pity on the Irish, either. Now if you want to know any more poems, Frankie, tell me and I'll get them from the pub and bring 'em back in my head.\nThe girl with the blue dress who's not right in the head suddenly says one day, Would you like a book for to read? and she brings me The Amazing Quest of Mr. Ernest Bliss by E. Phillips Oppenheim, which is all about an Englishman who is fed up and doesn't know what to do with himself every day even though he's so rich he can't count his money. His manservant brings him the morning paper the tea the egg the toast and marmalade and he says, Take it away, life is empty. He can't read his paper, he can't eat his egg, and he pines away. His doctor tells him go and live among the poor in the East End of London and he'll learn to love life, which he does and falls in love with a girl who is poor but honest and very intelligent and they get married and move into his house in the West End which is the rich part because it's easier to help the poor and not be fed up when you're nice and comfortable.\nSeamus likes me to tell him what I'm reading. He says that story about Mr. Ernest Bliss is a made-up story because no one in his right mind would have to go to a doctor over having too much money and not eating his egg though you never know. It might be like that in England. You'd never find the likes of that in Ireland. If you didn't eat your egg here you'd be carted off to the lunatic asylum or reported to the bishop.\nI can't wait to go home and tell Malachy about this man who won't eat his egg. Malachy will fall down on the floor laughing because such a thing could never happen. He'll say I'm making it up but when I tell him this story is about an Englishman he'll understand.\nI can't tell the girl in the blue dress that this story was silly because she might have a fit. She says if you're finished with that book I'll bring you another one because there's a whole box of books left behind by patients from the old days. She brings me a book called Tom Brown's School-Days, which is hard to read, and no end of books by P. G. Wodehouse, who makes me laugh over Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and Jeeves and all the Mulliners. Bertie Wooster is rich but he eats his egg every morning for fear of what Jeeves might say. I wish I could talk to the girl in the blue dress or anyone about the books but I'm afraid the Kerry nurse or Sister Rita might find out and they'd move me to a bigger ward upstairs with fifty empty beds and Famine ghosts galore with green mouths and bony fingers pointing. At night I lie in bed thinking about Tom Brown and his adventures at Rugby School and all the characters in P. G. Wodehouse. I can dream about the red lipped landlord's daughter and the highwayman, and the nurses and nuns can do nothing about it. It's lovely to know the world can't interfere with the inside of your head.\nIt's August and I'm eleven. I've been in this hospital for two months and I wonder if they'll let me out for Christmas. The Kerry nurse tells me I should get down on my two knees and thank God I'm alive at all at all and not be complaining.\nI'm not complaining, nurse, I'm only wondering if I'll be home for Christmas.\nShe won't answer me. She tells me behave myself or she'll send Sister Rita up to me and then I'll behave myself.\nMam comes to the hospital on my birthday and sends up a package with two chocolate bars and a note with names of people in the lane telling me get better and come home and you're a great soldier, Frankie. The nurse lets me talk to her through the window and it's hard because the windows are high and I have to stand on Seamus's shoulders. I tell Mam I want to go home but she says I'm a bit too weak and surely I'll be out in no time. Seamus says, 'Tis a grand thing to be eleven because any day now you'll be a man shaving and all and ready to get out and get a job and drink your pint good as any man.\nAfter fourteen weeks Sister Rita tells me I can go home and aren't I a lucky boy that the day will be the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. She tells me I was a very good patient, except for that little problem with the poem and Patricia Madigan, God rest her, and I'm invited to come back and have a big Christmas dinner in the hospital. Mam comes for me and with my weak legs it takes us a long time to walk to the bus at Union Cross. She says, Take your time. After three and a half months we can spare an hour.\nPeople are at their doors on Barrack Road and Roden Lane telling me it's grand to see me back, that I'm a great soldier, a credit to my father and mother. Malachy and Michael run up to me in the lane and say, God, you're walking very slow. Can't you run anymore?\nIt's a bright day and I'm happy till I see Dad sitting in the kitchen with Alphie on his lap and there's an empty feeling in my heart because I know he's out of work again. All along I was sure he had a job, Mam told me he did, and I thought there would be no shortage of food and shoes. He smiles at me and tells Alphie, Och, there's your big brother home from the hospital.\nMam tells him what the doctor said, that I'm to have plenty of nourishing food and rest. The doctor said beef would be the right thing for building me up again. Dad nods. Mam makes beef tea from a cube and Malachy and Mike watch me drink it. They say they'd like some too but Mam says go away, ye didn't have the typhoid. She says the doctor wants me to go to bed early. She tried to get rid of the fleas but they're worse than ever with the warm weather we're having. Besides, she says, they won't get much out of you all bones and little skin.\nI lie in bed and think of the hospital where the white sheets were changed every day and there wasn't a sign of a flea. There was a lavatory where you could sit and read your book till someone asked if you were dead. There was a bath where you could sit in hot water as long as you liked and say, I do believe, Induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy, And saying that helps me fall asleep.\nWhen Malachy and Michael get up for school in the morning Mam tells me I can stay in bed. Malachy is in fifth class now with Mr. O'Dea and he likes to tell everyone he's learning the big red catechism for Confirmation and Mr. O'Dea is telling them all about state of grace and Euclid and how the English tormented the Irish for eight hundred long years.\nI don't want to stay in bed anymore. The October days are lovely and I want to sit outside looking up the lane at the way the sun slants along the wall opposite our house. Mikey Moloney brings me P. G.\nWodehouse books his father gets from the library and I have great days with Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and all the Mulliners. Dad lets me read his favorite book, John Mitchel's Jail Journal, which is all about a great Irish rebel the English condemned to exile in Van Diemen's land in Australia. The English tell John Mitchel he's free to come and go as he pleases all over Van Diemen's land if he gives his word of honor as a gentleman he won't try to escape. He gives his word till a ship comes to help him escape and he goes to the office of the English magistrate and says, I'm escaping, jumps on his horse and winds up in New York. Dad says he doesn't mind if I read silly English books by P. G. Wodehouse as long as I don't forget the men who did their bit and gave their lives for Ireland.\nI can't stay at home forever and Mam takes me back to Leamy's School in November. The new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, says he's sorry, I've missed over two months of school and I have to be put back in fifth class. Mam says surely I'm ready for sixth class. After all, she says, he's missed only a few weeks. Mr. O'Halloran says he's sorry, take the boy next door to Mr. O'Dea.\nWe walk along the hallway and I tell Mam I don't want to be in fifth class. Malachy is in that class and I don't want to be in a class with my brother who is a year younger. I made my Confirmation last year. He didn't. I'm older. I'm not bigger anymore because of the typhoid but I'm older.\nMam says, It won't kill you.\nShe doesn't care and I'm put into that class with Malachy and I know all his friends are there sneering at me because I was put back. Mr. O'Dea makes me sit in the front and tells me get that sour look off my puss or I'll feel the end of his ash plant.\nThen a miracle happens and it's all because of St. Francis of Assisi, my favorite saint, and Our Lord Himself. I find a penny in the street that first day back at school and I want to run to Kathleen O'Connell's for a big square of Cleeves' toffee but I can't run because my legs are still weak from the typhoid and sometimes I have to hold on to a wall. I'm desperate for the Cleeves'toffee but I'm also desperate to get out of fifth class.\nI know I have to go to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi. He's the only one who will listen but he's at the other end of Limerick and it takes me an hour to walk there, sitting on steps, holding on to walls. It's a penny to light a candle and I wonder if I should just light the candle and keep the penny. No, St. Francis would know. He loves the bird in the air and the fish in the stream but he's not a fool. I light the candle, I kneel at his statue and beg him to get me out of fifth class where I'm stuck with my brother, who is probably going around the lane now bragging that his big brother was kept back. St. Francis doesn't say a word but I know he's listening and I know he'll get me out of that class. It's the least he could do after all my trouble coming to his statue, sitting on steps, holding on to walls, when I could have gone to St. Joseph's Church and lit a candle to the Little Flower or the Sacred Heart of Jesus Himself. What's the use of being named after him if he's going to desert me in my hour of need?\nI have to sit in Mr. O'Dea's class listening to the catechism and all the other stuff he taught last year. I'd like to raise my hand and give the answers but he says, Be quiet, let your brother answer. He gives them tests in arithmetic and makes me sit there and correct them. He\ndictates to them in Irish and makes me correct what they've written. Then he gives me special compositions to write and makes me read them to the class because of all I learned from him last year. He tells the class, Frank McCourt is going to show you how well he learned to write in this class last year. He's going to write a composition on Our Lord, aren't you, McCourt? He's going to tell us what it would be like if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick which has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family and is the holiest city in Ireland. We know that if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick He would never have been crucified because the people of Limerick were always good Catholics and not given to crucifixion. So, McCourt, you are to go home and write that composition and bring it in tomorrow.\nDad says Mr. O'Dea has a great imagination but didn't Our Lord suffer enough on the cross without sticking Him in Limerick on top of it with the damp from the River Shannon. He puts on his cap and goes for a long walk and I have to think about Our Lord by myself and wonder what I'm going to write tomorrow.\nThe next day Mr. O'Dea says, All right, McCourt, read your composition to the class.\nThe name of my composition is-\nThe title, McCourt, the title.\nThe title of my composition is, \"Jesus and the Weather. \"\nWhat?\n\"Jesus and the Weather. \"\nAll right, read it.\nThis is my composition. I don't think Jesus Who is Our Lord would\nhave liked the weather in Limerick because it's always raining and the Shannon keeps the whole city damp. My father says the Shannon is a killer river because it killed my two brothers. When you look at pictures of Jesus He's always wandering around ancient Israel in a sheet. It never rains there and you never hear of anyone coughing or getting consumption or anything like that and no one has a job there because all they do is stand around and eat manna and shake their fists and go to crucifixions.\nAnytime Jesus got hungry all He had to do was walk up the road to a fig tree or an orange tree and have His fill. If He wanted a pint He could wave His hand over a big glass and there was the pint. Or He could visit Mary Magdalene and her sister, Martha, and they'd give Him His dinner no questions asked and He'd get his feet washed and dried with Mary Magdalene's hair while Martha washed the dishes, which I don't think is fair. Why should she have to wash the dishes while her sister sits out there chatting away with Our Lord? It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place because if he was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have to learn the catechism and write compositions about Him. The End.\nMr. O'Dea is quiet and gives me a strange look and I'm worried because when he's quiet like that it means someone is going to suffer. He says, McCourt, who wrote that composition?\nI did, sir.\nDid your father write that composition? He didn't, sir.\nCome here, McCourt.\nI follow him out the door, along the hall to the headmaster's room. Mr. O'Dea shows him my composition and Mr. O'Halloran gives me the strange look, too. Did you write this composition?\nI did, sir.\nI'm taken out of the fifth class and put into Mr. O'Halloran's sixth class with all the boys I know, Paddy Clohessy, Fintan Slattery, The Question Quigley, and when school is over that day I have to go back down to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi to thank him even if my legs are still weak from the typhoid and I have to sit on steps and hold on to walls and I wonder was it something good I said in that composition or something bad.\nMr. Thomas L. O'Halloran teaches three classes in one room, sixth, seventh, eighth. He has a head like President Roosevelt and he wears gold glasses. He wears suits, navy blue or gray, and there's a gold watch chain that hangs across his belly from pocket to pocket in his waistcoat. We call him Hoppy because he has a short leg and hops when he walks. He knows what we call him and he says, Yes, I'm Hoppy and I'll hop on you. He carries a long stick, a pointer, and if you don't pay attention or give a stupid answer he gives you three slaps on each hand or whacks you across the backs of your legs. He makes you learn everything by heart, everything, and that makes him the hardest master in the school. He loves America and makes us know all the American states in alphabetical order. He makes charts of Irish grammar, Irish history and algebra at home, hangs them on an easel and we have to chant our way through the cases, conjugations and declensions of Irish, famous names and battles, proportions, ratios, equations. We have to know all the important dates in Irish history. He tells us what is important and why. No master ever told us why before. If you asked why you'd be hit on the head. Hoppy doesn't call us idiots and if you ask a question he doesn't go into a rage. He's the only master who stops and says, Do ye understand what I'm talking about? Do ye want to ask a question?\nIt's a shock to everyone when he says, the Battle of Kinsale in sixteen nought one was the saddest moment in Irish history, a close battle with cruelty and atrocities on both sides.\nCruelty on both sides? The Irish side? How could that be? All the other masters told us the Irish always fought nobly, they always fought the fair fight. He recites and makes us remember, They went forth to battle, but they always fell, Their eyes were fixed above the sullen shields.\nNobly they fought and bravely, but not well, And sank heart wounded by a subtle spell.\nIf they lost it was because of traitors and informers. But I want to know about these Irish atrocities.\nSir, did the Irish commit atrocities at the Battle of Kinsale?\nThey did, indeed. It is recorded that they killed prisoners but they were no better nor worse than the English.\nMr. O'Halloran can't lie. He's the headmaster. All these years we were told the Irish were always noble and they made brave speeches before the English hanged them. Now Hoppy O'Halloran is saying the Irish did bad things. Next thing he'll be saying the English did good things. He says, You have to study and learn so that you can make up your own mind about history and everything else but you can't make up an empty mind. Stock your mind, stock your mind. It is your house of treasure and no one in the world can interfere with it. If you won the Irish Sweepstakes and\nbought a house that needed furniture would you fill it with bits and pieces of rubbish? Your mind is your house and if you fill it with rubbish from the cinemas it will rot in your head. You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace.\nHe calls us one by one to the front of the room and looks at our shoes. He wants to know why they're broken or why we have no shoes at all. He tells us this is a disgrace and he's going to have a raffle to raise money so that we can have strong warm boots for the winter. He gives us books of tickets and we swarm all over Limerick for Leamy's School boot fund, first prize five pounds, five prizes of a pound each. Eleven boys with no boots get new boots. Malachy and I don't get any because we have shoes on our feet even if the soles are worn away and we wonder why we ran all over Limerick selling tickets so that other boys could get boots. Fintan Slattery says we gain plenary Indulgences for works of charity and Paddy Clohessy says, Fintan, would you ever go and have a good shit for yourself.\nI know when Dad does the bad thing. I know when he drinks the dole money and Mam is desperate and has to beg at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and ask for credit at Kathleen O'Connell's shop but I don't want to back away from him and run to Mam. How can I do that when I'm up with him early every morning with the whole world asleep? He lights the fire and makes the tea and sings to himself or reads the paper to me in a whisper that won't wake up the rest of the family. Mikey Molloy stole Cuchulain, the Angel on the Seventh Step is gone someplace else, but my father in the morning is still mine. He gets the Irish Press early and tells me about the world, Hitler, Mussolini, Franco. He says this war is none of our business because the English are up to their tricks again. He tells me about the great Roosevelt in Washington and the great De Valera in Dublin. In the morning we have the world to ourselves and he never tells me I should die for Ireland. He tells me about the old days in Ireland when the English wouldn't let the Catholics have schools because they wanted to keep the people ignorant, that the Catholic children met in hedge schools in the depths of the country and learned English, Irish, Latin and Greek. The people loved learning. They loved stories and poetry even if none of this was any good for getting a job. Men, women and children would gather in ditches to hear those great masters and everyone wondered at how much a man could carry in his head. The masters risked their lives going from ditch to ditch and hedge to hedge because if the English caught them teaching they might be transported to foreign parts or worse. He tells me school is easy now, you don't have to sit in a ditch learning your sums or the glorious history of Ireland. I should be good in school and some day I'll go back to America and get an inside job where I'll be sitting at a desk with two fountain pens in my pocket, one red and one blue, making decisions. I'll be in out of the rain and I'll have a suit and shoes and a warm place to live and what more could a man want? He says you can do anything in America, it's the land of opportunity. You can be a fisherman in Maine or a farmer in California. America is not like Limerick, a gray place with a river that kills.\nWhen you have your father to yourself by the fire in the morning you don't need Cuchulain or the Angel on the Seventh Step or anything.\nAt night he helps us with our exercises. Mam says they call it homework in America but here it's exercises, the sums, the English, the Irish, the history. He can't help us with Irish because he's from the North and lacking in the native tongue. Malachy offers to teach him all\nthe Irish words he knows but Dad says it's too late, you can't teach an old dog a new bark. Before bed we sit around the fire and if we say, Dad, tell us a story, he makes up one about someone in the lane and the story will take us all over the world, up in the air, under the sea and back to the lane. Everyone in the story is a different color and everything is upside down and backward. Motor cars and planes go under water and submarines fly through the air. Sharks sit in trees and giant salmon sport with kangaroos on the moon. Polar bears wrestle with elephants in Australia and penguins teach Zulus how to play bagpipes. After the story he takes us upstairs and kneels with us while we say our prayers. We say the Our Father, three Hail Marys, God bless the Pope. God bless Mam, God bless our dead sister and brothers, God bless Ireland, God bless De Valera, and God bless anyone who gives Dad a job. He says, Go to sleep, boys, because holy God is watching you and He always knows if you're not good.\nI think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, the one in the morning with the paper, the one at night with the stories and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland.\nI feel sad over the bad thing but I can't back away from him because the one in the morning is my real father and if I were in America I could say, I love you, Dad, the way they do in the films, but you can't say that in Limerick for fear you might be laughed at. You're allowed to say you love God and babies and horses that win but anything else is a softness in the head.\nDay and night we're tormented in that kitchen with people emptying their buckets. Mam says it's not the River Shannon that will kill us but the stink from that lavatory outside our door. It's bad enough in the winter when everything flows over and seeps under our door but worse in the warm weather when there are flies and bluebottles and rats.\nThere is a stable next to the lavatory where they keep the big horse from Gabbett's coal yard. His name is Finn the Horse and we all love him but the stable man from the coal yard doesn't take proper care of the stable and the stink travels to our house. The stink from the lavatory and the stable attracts rats and we have to chase them with our new dog, Lucky. He loves to corner the rats and then we smash them to bits with rocks or sticks or stab them with the hay fork in the stable. The horse himself is frightened by the rats and we have to be careful when he rears up. He knows we're not rats because we bring him apples when we rob an orchard out the country.\nSometimes the rats escape and run into our house and into the coal hole under the stairs where it's pitch dark and you can't see them. Even when we bring in a candle we can't find them because they dig holes everywhere and we don't know where to look. If we have a fire we can boil water and pour it slowly in from the kettle spot and that will drive them out of the hole between our legs and out the door again unless Lucky is there to catch them in his teeth and shake the life out of them. We expect him to eat the rats but he'll leave them in the lane with their guts hanging out and run to my father for a piece of bread dipped in tea. People in the lane say that's a peculiar way for a dog to behave but then what would you expect from a dog of the McCourts.\nThe minute there's a sign of a rat or a mention of one Mam is out the door and up the lane. She'd rather walk the streets of Limerick forever than stay one minute in a house that has a rat in it and she can\nnever rest because she knows that with the stable and the lavatory there's always a rat nearby with his family waiting for their dinner.\nWe fight the rats and we fight the stink from that lavatory. We'd like to keep our door open in the warm weather but you can't when people are trotting down the lane to empty their brimming buckets. Some families are worse than others and Dad hates all of them even though Mam tells him it's not their fault if the builders a hundred years ago put up houses with no lavatories but this one outside our door. Dad says the people should empty their buckets in the middle of the night when we are asleep so that we won't be disturbed by the stink.\nThe flies are nearly as bad as the rats. On warm days they swarm to the stable and when a bucket is emptied they swarm to the lavatory. If Mam cooks anything they swarm into the kitchen and Dad says it's disgusting to think the fly sitting there on the sugar bowl was on the toilet bowl, or what's left of it, a minute ago. If you have an open sore they find it and torment you. By day you have the flies, by night you have the fleas. Mam says there's one good thing about fleas, they're clean, but flies are filthy, you never know where they came from and they carry diseases galore. We can chase the rats and kill them.\nWe can slap at the flies and the fleas and kill them but there's nothing we can do about the neighbors and their buckets. If we're out in the lane playing and we see someone with a bucket we call to our own house, Bucket coming, close the door, close the door, and whoever is inside runs to the door. In warm weather we run to close the door all day because we know which families have the worst buckets. There are families whose fathers have jobs and if they get into the habit of cooking with curry we know their buckets will stink to the heavens and make us sick. Now with the war on and men sending money from England more and more families are cooking with curry and our house is filled with the stink day and night. We know the families with the curry, we know the ones with the cabbage. Mam is sick all the time, Dad takes longer and longer walks into the country, and we play outside as much as we can and far from the lavatory. Dad doesn't complain about the River Shannon anymore. He knows now the lavatory is worse and he takes me with him to the Town Hall to complain. The man there says, Mister, all I can tell you is you can move. Dad says we can't afford to move and the man says there's nothing he can do. Dad says, This is not India. This is a Christian country. The lane needs more lavatories. The man says, Do you expect Limerick to start building lavatories in houses that are falling down anyway, that will be demolished after the war? Dad says that lavatory could kill us all. The man says we live in dangerous times.\nMam says it's hard enough keeping a fire going to cook the Christmas dinner but if I'm going to Christmas dinner at the hospital I'll have to wash myself from top to bottom. She wouldn't give it to Sister Rita to say I was neglected or ripe for another disease. She boils a pot of water early in the morning before Mass and nearly scalds the scalp off me. She scours my ears and scrubs my skin so hard it tingles. She can afford tuppence for the bus out to the hospital but I'll have to walk back and that will be good for me because I'll be stuffed with food and now she has to get the fire going again for the pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes which she got once again through the kindness of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and she's determined this will be the last time we celebrate the birth of Our Lord with pig's head.\nNext year we'll have a goose or a nice ham and why wouldn't we, isn't Limerick famous the world over for the ham?\nSister Rita says, Now would you look at this, our little soldier looking so healthy. No meat on the bones but still. Now tell me, did you go to Mass this morning?\nI did, Sister.\nAnd did you receive?\nI did, Sister.\nShe takes me into an empty ward and tells me sit there on that\nchair it won't be long now till I get my dinner. She leaves and I wonder if I'll be eating with nuns and nurses or will I be in a ward with children having their Christmas dinner. In awhile my dinner is brought in by the girl in the blue dress who brought me the books. She places the tray on the side of a bed and I pull up a chair. She frowns at me and screws up her face. You, she says, that's your dinner an' I'm not bringin' you any books.\nThe dinner is delicious, turkey, mashed potatoes, peas, jelly and custard, and a pot of tea. The jelly and custard dish looks delicious and I can't resist it so I'll have it first there's no one there to notice but when I'm eating it the girl in the blue dress comes in with bread and says, What are you doin'?\nNothing.\nYes, you are. You're atin' the sweet before the dinner, and she runs out calling, Sister Rita, Sister Rita, come in quick, and the nun rushes in, Francis, are you all right?\nI am, Sister.\nHe's not all right, Sister. He do be atin' his jelly an custard before his dinner. That's a sin, Sister.\nAh, now, dear, you run along and I'll talk to Francis about that.\nDo, Sister, talk to him or all the childer in the hospital will be atin' their sweet before their dinner an' then where will we be?\nIndeed, indeed, where will we be? Run along now.\nThe girl leaves and Sister Rita smiles at me. God love her, she doesn't miss a thing even in her confusion. We have to be patient with her, Francis, the way she's touched.\nShe leaves and it's quiet in that empty ward and when I'm finished I don't know what to do because you're not supposed to do anything till they tell you. Hospitals and schools always tell you what to do. I wait a long time till the girl in the blue dress comes in for the tray. Are you finished? she says.\nand I tells\nI am.\nWell, that's all you're gettin' an' now you can go home.\nSurely girls who are not right in the head can't tell you go home\nwonder if I should wait for Sister Rita. A nurse in the hallway\nme Sister Rita is having her dinner and is not to be bothered. It's a long walk from Union Cross to Barrack Hill and when I get\nhome my family are up in Italy and well into their pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes. I tell them about my Christmas dinner. Mam wants to know if I had it with the nurses and nuns and she gets a bit angry when I tell her I ate alone in a ward and that's no way to treat a child. She tells me sit down and have some pig's head and I force it into my mouth and I'm so stuffed I have to lie on the bed with my belly sticking out a mile.\nIt's early in the morning and there's a motor car outside our door, the first one we've ever seen in the lane. There are men in suits looking in the door of the stable of Finn the Horse and there must be something wrong because you never see men with suits in the lane.\nIt's Finn the Horse. He's lying on the floor of the stable looking up the lane and there's white stuff like milk around his mouth. The stable man who takes care of Finn the Horse says he found him like that this morning and it's strange because he's always up and ready for his feed. The men are shaking their heads. My brother Michael says to one of the men, Mister, what's up with Finn?\nSick horse, son. Go home.\nThe stable man who takes care of Finn has the whiskey smell on him. He says to Michael, That horse is a goner. We have to shoot him.\nMichael pulls at my hand. Frank, they're not to shoot him. Tell them. You're big.\nThe stable man says, Go home, boy. Go home.\nMichael attacks him, kicks him, scrawbs the back of his hand, and the man sends Michael flying. Hould that brother of yours, he tells me, hould him.\nOne of the other men takes something yellow and brown from a bag, goes to Finn, puts it to his head and there's a sharp crack. Finn shivers. Michael screams at the man and attacks him too but the man says, The horse was sick, son. He's better off.\nThe men in suits drive away and the stable man says he has to wait for the lorry to take Finn away, he can't leave him alone or the rats will be at him. He wants to know if we'd keep an eye on the horse with our dog Lucky while he goes to the pub, he's blue mouldy for a pint.\nNo rat has a chance to get near Finn the Horse the way Michael is there with a stick small as he is. The man comes back smelling of porter and then there's the big lorry to take the horse away, a big lorry with three men and two great planks that slope from the back of the lorry to Finn's head. The three men and the stable man tie ropes around Finn and pull him up the planks and the people in the lane yell at the men because of the nails and broken wood in the planks that catch at Finn and tear out bits of his hide and streak the planks with bright pink horse blood.\nYe are destroyin' that horse.\nCan't ye have respect for the dead?\nGo easy with that poor horse.\nThe stable man says, For the love o' Jaysus what are ye squawkin'\nabout? 'Tis only a dead horse, and Michael runs at him again with his head down and his small fists flying till the stable man gives him a shove that sends him on his back and Mam goes at the stable man in such a rage he runs up the planks and over Finn's body to escape. He comes back drunk in the evening to sleep it off and after he leaves there's a smoldering in the hay and the stable burns down the rats running up the lane with every boy and dog chasing them till they escape into the streets of respectable people.\nIX\nMam says, Alphie is enough. I'm worn out. That's the end of it. No more children.\nDad says, The good Catholic woman must perform her wifely duties and submit to her husband or face eternal damnation.\nMam says, As long as there are no more children eternal damnation sounds attractive enough to me.\nWhat is Dad to do? There's a war on. English agents are recruiting Irishmen to work in their munitions factories, the pay is good, there are no jobs in Ireland, and if the wife turns her back to you there's no shortage of women in England where the able men are off fighting Hitler and Mussolini and you can do anything you like as long as you remember you're Irish and lower class and don't try to rise above your station.\nFamilies up and down the lane are getting telegram money orders from their fathers in England. They rush to the post office to cash the money orders so they can shop and show the world their good fortune on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The boys get their hair cut on Saturdays, the women curl their hair with iron tongs hot from the fire. They're very grand now the way they pay sixpence or even a shilling for seats at the Savoy Cinema where you'll meet a better class of people than the lower classes who fill the tuppenny seats in the gods at the Lyric Cinema and are never done shouting at the screen, the kind of people if you don't mind who are liable to cheer on the Africans when they throw spears at Tarzan or the Indians when they're scalping the United States Cavalry. The new rich people go home after Mass on Sundays all airs and stuff themselves with meat and potatoes, sweets and cakes galore, and they think nothing of drinking their tea from delicate little cups which stand in saucers to catch the tea that overflows and when they lift the cups they stick out their little fingers to show how refined they are. Some stop going to fish and chip shops altogether because you see nothing in those places but drunken soldiers and night girls and men that drank their dole and their wives screeching at them to come home. The brave new rich will be seen at the Savoy Restaurant or the Stella drinking tea, eating little buns, patting their lips with serviettes if you don't mind, coming home on the bus and complaining the service is not what it used to be. They have electricity now so they can see things they never saw before and when darkness falls they turn on the new wireless to hear how the war is going. They thank God for Hitler because if he hadn't marched all over Europe the men of Ireland would still be at home scratching their arses on the queue at the Labour Exchange.\nSome families sing,\nYip aye aidy aye ay aye oh\nYip aye aidy aye ay,\nWe don't care about England or France, All we want is the German advance.\nIf there's a chill in the air they'll turn on the electric fire for the comfort that's in it and sit in their kitchens listening to the news declaring how sorry they are for the English women and children dying under the German bombs but look what England did to us for eight hundred years.\nThe families with fathers in England are able to lord it over the families that don't. At dinnertime and teatime the new rich mothers stand at their doors and call to their children, Mikey, Kathleen, Paddy, come in for yeer dinner. Come in for the lovely leg o'lamb and the gorgeous green peas and the floury white potatoes.\nSean, Josie, Peggy, come in for yeer tea, come in at wanst for the fresh bread and butter and the gorgeous blue duck egg what no one else in the lane have.\nBrendan, Annie, Patsy, come in for the fried black puddin', the sizzlin' sausages and the lovely trifle soaked in the best of Spanish sherry.\nAt times like this Mam tells us to stay inside. We have nothing but bread and tea and she doesn't want the tormenting neighbors to see us with our tongues hanging out, suffering over the lovely smells floating up and down the lane. She says 'tis easy to see they're not used to having anything the way they brag about everything. 'Tis a real low-class mind that will call out the door and tell the world what they're having for the supper. She says 'tis their way of getting a rise out of us because Dad is a foreigner from the North and he won't have anything to do with any of them. Dad says all that food comes from English money and no luck will come to those who took it but what could you expect from Limerick anyway, people who profit from Hitler's war, people who will work and fight for the English. He says he'll never go over there and help England win a war. Mam says, No, you'll stay here where there's no work and hardly a lump of coal to boil water for the tea. No, you'll stay here and drink the dole when the humor is on you. You'll watch your sons going around with broken shoes and their arses hanging out of their trousers. Every house in the lane has electricity and we're lucky if we have a candle. God above, if I had the fare I'd be off to England myself for I'm sure they need women in the factories.\nDad says a factory is no place for a woman.\nMam says, Sitting on your arse by the fire is no place for a man. I say to him, Why can't you go to England, Dad, so we can have\nelectricity and a wireless and Mam can stand at the door and tell the world what we're having at dinnertime?\nHe says, Don't you want to have your father here at home with you?\nI do but you can come back at the end of the war and we can all go to America.\nHe sighs, Och, aye, och, aye. All right he'll go to England after Christmas because America is in the war now and the cause must be just. He'd never go if the Americans hadn't gone in. He tells me I'll have to be the man of the house, and he signs up with an agent to work in a factory in Coventry which, everyone says, is the most bombed city in England. The agent says, There's plenty of work for willing men. You can work overtime till you drop and if you save it up, mate, you'll be Rockefeller at the end of the war.\nWe're up early to see Dad off at the railway station. Kathleen O'Connell at the shop knows Dad is off to England and money will be flowing back so she's happy to let Mam have credit for tea, milk, sugar, bread, butter and an egg.\nAn egg.\nMam says, This egg is for your father. He needs the nourishment for the long journey before him.\nIt's a hard-boiled egg and Dad peels off the shell. He slices the egg five ways and gives each of us a bit to put on our bread. Mam says, Don't be such a fool. Dad says, What would a man be doing with a whole egg to himself? Mam has tears on her eyelashes. She pulls her chair over to the fireplace. We all eat our bread and egg and watch her cry till she says, What are ye gawkin' at? and turns away to look into the ashes. Her\nbread and egg are still on the table and I wonder if she has any plans for them. They look delicious and I'm still hungry but Dad gets up and brings them to her with the tea. She shakes her head but he presses them on her and she eats and drinks, snuffling and crying. He sits opposite her a while, silent, till she looks up at the clock and says, 'Tis time to go. He puts on his cap and picks up his bag. Mam wraps Alphie in an old blanket and we set off through the streets of Limerick.\nThere are other families in the streets. The going away fathers walk ahead, the mothers carry babies or push prams. A mother with a pram will say to other mothers, God above, missus, you must be fagged out carrying that child. Sure, why don't you stick him into the pram here and rest your poor arms.\nPrams might be packed with four or five babies squalling away because the prams are old and the wheels bockety and the babies are rocked till they get sick and throw up their goody.\nThe men call to each other. Grand day, Mick. Lovely day for the journey, Joe. 'Tis, indeed, Mick. Arrah, we might as well have a pint before we go, Joe. We might as well, Mick. Might as well be drunk as the way we are, Joe.\nThey laugh and the women behind them are teary eyed and red nosed.\nIn the pubs around the railway station the men are packed in drinking the money the agents gave them for travel food. They're having the last pint, the last drop of whiskey on Irish soil, For God knows it might be the last we'll ever have, Mick, the way the Jerries are bombing the bejesus outa England and not a minute too soon after what they did to us and isn't it a tragic thing entirely the way we have to go over there and save the arse of the ancient foe.\nThe women stay outside the pubs talking. Mam tells Mrs. Meehan, The first telegram money order I get I'll be in the shop buying a big breakfast so that we can all have our own egg of a Sunday morning.\nI look at my brother Malachy. Did you hear that? Our own egg of a Sunday morning. Oh, God, I already had plans for my egg. Tap it around the top, gently crack the shell, lift with a spoon, a dab of butter down into the yolk, salt, take my time, a dip of the spoon, scoop, more salt, more butter, into the mouth, oh, God above, if heaven has a taste it must be an egg with butter and salt, and after the egg is there anything in the world lovelier than fresh warm bread and a mug of sweet golden tea?\nSome men are already too drunk to walk and the English agents are paying sober men to drag them out of the pubs and throw them on a great horse drawn float to be hauled to the station and dumped into the train. The agents are desperate to get everyone out of the pubs. Come on, men. Miss this train and you'll miss a good job. Come on, men, we have the Guinness in England. We have the Jameson. Now, men, please, men. You're drinking your food money and you'll get no more.\nThe men tell the agents to kiss their Irish arses, that the agents are lucky they're alive, lucky they're not hanging from the nearest lamppost after what they did to Ireland. And the men sing, On Mountjoy one Monday morning High upon the gallows tree, Kevin Barry gave his young life For the cause of liberty.\nThe train wails in the station and the agents beg the women to get their men out of the pubs and the men stumble out singing and crying and hugging their wives and children and promising to send so much money Limerick will be turned into another New York. The men climb the station\nsteps and the women and children call after them, Kevin, love, mind yourself and don't be wearing damp shirts.\nDry your socks, Michael, or the bunions will destroy you entirely. Paddy, go easy on the drink, are you listenin', Paddy?\nDad, Dad, don't go, Dad.\nTommy, don't forget to send the money. The children are skin and\nbones.\nPeter, don't forget to be takin' the medicine for your weak chest,\nGod help us.\nLarry, mind them bloody bombs.\nChristy, don't be talkin' to them Englishwomen. They're full of\ndiseases.\nJackie, come back. Sure we'll manage somehow. Don't go, Jack-e-e,\nJack-e-e, oh, Jesus, don't go.\nDad pats our heads. He tells us remember our religious duties but,\nabove all, obey our mother. He stands before her. She has the baby Alphie in her arms. She says, Mind yourself. He drops the bag and puts his arms around her. They stay that way a moment till the baby yelps between them. He nods, picks up his bag, climbs the steps to the station, turns to wave and he's gone.\nBack at home Mam says, I don't care. I know it sounds extravagant but I'm going to light the fire and make more tea for it isn't every day your father goes to England.\nWe sit around the fire and drink our tea and cry because we have no father, till Mam says, Don't cry, don't cry. Now that your father is gone to England surely our troubles will be over.\nSurely.\nMam and Bridey Hannon sit by the fire upstairs in Italy smoking Woodbines, drinking tea, and I sit on the stairs listening. We have a father in England so that we can get all we want from Kathleen O'Connell's shop and pay when he starts sending the money in a fortnight. Mam tells Bridey she can't wait to get out of this bloody lane to a place with a decent lavatory that we don't have to share with half the world. We'll all have new boots and coats to keep off the rain so we won't be coming home from school famished. We'll have eggs and rashers on Sunday for breakfast and ham and cabbage and potatoes for dinner. We'll have electric light and why shouldn't we? Weren't Frank and Malachy born to it in America where everyone has it?\nAll we have to do now is wait for two weeks till the telegram boy knocks at the door. Dad will have to settle into his job in England, buy work clothes and get a place to stay, so the first money order won't be big, three pounds or three pounds ten, but soon we'll be like other families in the lane, five pounds a week, paying off debts, buying new clothes, putting something in the savings against the time we'll pack up and move to England entirely and save there to go to America. Mam herself could get a job in an English factory making bombs or something and God knows we wouldn't know ourselves with the money pouring in. She wouldn't be happy if we grew up with English accents but better an English accent than an empty belly.\nBridey says it doesn't matter what class of an accent an Irishman has for he'll never forget what the English did to us for eight hundred long years.\nWe know what Saturdays are in the lane. We know some families like the Downeses across from us get their telegram early because Mr. Downes\nis a steady man who knows how to have a pint or two on a Friday and go home to his bed. We know men like him run to the post office the minute they're paid so their families won't know a minute of waiting or worry. Men like Mr. Downes send their sons RAF wings to wear on their coats. That's what we want and that's what we told Dad before he left, Don't forget the RAF badges, Dad.\nWe see the telegram boys on their bicycles swing into the lane. They're happy telegram boys because the tips they get in the lanes are bigger than anything they get in the grand streets and avenues where rich people will begrudge you the steam of their piss.\nThe families that get the early telegrams have that contented look. They'll have all day Saturday to enjoy the money. They'll shop, they'll eat, they'll have all day to think about what they'll do that night and that's almost as good as the thing itself because Saturday night when you have a few shillings in your pocket is the most delicious night of the week.\nThere are families don't get the telegram every week and you know them by the anxious look. Mrs. Meagher has waited at her door every Saturday for two months. My mother says she'd be ashamed of her life to wait at the door like that. All the children play in the lane and keep an eye out for the telegram boy. Hoi, telegram boy, do you have anything for Meagher? and when he says no they say, Are you sure? and he'll say, Course I'm sure. I know what I have in my feckin' pouch.\nEveryone knows the telegram boys stop coming when the Angelus rings at six and darkness brings desperation to the women and children.\nTelegram boy, will you look in your pouch again? Please. Aw, God. I did. I have nothing for ye.\nAw, God, please look. Our name is Meagher. Will you look?\nI know bloody well yeer name is Meagher and I looked.\nThe children claw at him up on his bicycle and he kicks at them, Jesus, will ye get away from me.\nOnce the Angelus rings at six in the evening the day is over. The ones with the telegrams are having their supper with the electric light blazing away and the ones that didn't get the telegrams have to light candles and see if Kathleen O'Connell might let them have tea and bread till this time next week when surely with the help of God and His Blessed Mother the telegram will come.\nMr. Meehan at the top of the lane went to England with Dad and when the telegram boy stops at Meehan's we know we'll be next. Mam has her coat ready to go to the post office but she won't leave the chair by the fire in Italy till she has the telegram in her hand. The telegram boy rides down the lane and swings over to Downeses'. He hands them their telegram, takes the tip and turns his bicycle around to head back up the lane. Malachy calls, Telegram boy, do you have something for McCourt? Ours is coming today. The telegram boy shakes his head and rides away.\nMam puffs on her Woodbine. Well, we have all day though I'd like to do a bit of shopping early before the best hams are gone at Barry the butcher. She can't leave the fire and we can't leave the lane for fear the telegram boy might come and find no one at home. Then we'd have to wait till Monday to cash the money order and that would destroy the weekend entirely. We'd have to watch the Meehans and everyone else parading around in their new clothes and staggering home with eggs and potatoes and sausages for Sunday and sailing off to the films on Saturday night. No, we can't move an inch till that telegram boy comes. Mam says\ndon't be too worried between noon and two because so many telegram boys go for their dinner and there will surely be a big rush between two and the Angelus. We don't have a thing to worry about till six. We stop every telegram boy. We tell them our name is McCourt, that this is our first telegram, it should be three pounds or more, they might have forgotten to put our name on it or our address, is he sure? is he sure? One boy tells us he'll inquire at the post office. He says he knows what 'tis like to wait for the telegram because his own father is a drunken oul' shit over in England that never sent a penny. Mam hears him inside and tells us you should never talk about your father like that. The same telegram boy comes back just before the Angelus at six and tells us he asked Mrs. O'Connell at the post office if they had anything for McCourt all day and they didn't. Mam turns toward the dead ashes in the fire and sucks at the last bit of goodness in the Woodbine butt caught between the brown thumb and the burnt middle finger. Michael who is only five and won't understand anything till he's eleven like me wants to know if we're having fish and chips tonight because he's hungry. Mam says, Next week, love, and he goes back out to play in the lane.\nYou don't know what to do with yourself when the first telegram doesn't come. You can't stay out in the lane playing with your brothers all night because everyone else is gone in and you'd be ashamed to stay out in the lane to be tormented with smells of sausages and rashers and fried bread. You don't want to look at electric light coming through the windows after dark and you don't want to hear the news from the BBC or Radio Eireann from other people's wirelesses. Mrs. Meagher and her children are gone in and there's only the dim light of a candle from their kitchen. They're ashamed too. They stay inside on Saturday nights and they don't even go to Mass on Sunday mornings. Bridey Hannon told Mam that Mrs. Meagher is in a constant state of shame over the rags they wear and so desperate she goes down to the Dispensary for the public assistance. Mam says that's the worst thing that could happen to any family. It's worse than going on the dole, it's worse than going to the St. Vincent de Paul Society, it's worse than begging on the streets with the tinkers and the knackers. It's the last thing you'd do to keep yourself out of the poor house and the children from the orphanage.\nThere's a sore at the top of my nose between my eyebrows, gray and red and itching. Grandma says, Don't touch that sore and don't put water near it or it'll spread. If you broke your arm she'd say don't touch that with water it'll spread. The sore spreads into my eyes anyway and now they're red and yellow from the stuff that oozes and makes them stick in the morning. They stick so hard I have to force my eyelids open with my fingers and Mam has to scrub off that yellow stuff with a damp rag and boric powder. The eyelashes fall off and every bit of dust in Limerick blows into my eyes on windy days. Grandma tells me I have naked eyes and she says it's my own fault, all that eye trouble comes from sitting up there at the top of the lane under the light pole in all kinds of weather with my nose stuck in books and the same thing will happen to Malachy if he doesn't give over with the reading. You can see little Michael is getting just as bad sticking his nose in books when he should be out playing like a healthy child. Books, books, books, says Grandma, ye will ruin yeer eyes entirely.\nShe's having tea with Mam and I hear her whisper, The thing to do is give him St. Anthony's spit.\nWhat's that? says Mam.\nYour fasting spit in the morning. Go to him before he wakes and spit on his eyes for the spit of a fasting mother has powerful cures in\nit.\nBut I'm always awake before Mam. I force my eyes open long before\nshe stirs. I can hear her coming across the floor and when she stands over me for the spit I open my eyes. God, she says, your eyes are open.\nI think they're getting better.\nThat's good, and she goes back to bed.\nThe eyes don't heal and she takes me to the Dispensary where the\npoor people see doctors and get their medicines. It's the place to apply for public assistance when a father is dead or disappeared and there's no dole money, no wages.\nThere are benches along the walls by the doctors' offices. The benches are always packed with people talking about their ailments. Old men and women sit and groan and babies scream and mothers say hush, love, hush. There's a high platform in the middle of the Dispensary with a counter circling it chest high. When you want anything you stand in a queue before that platform to see Mr. Coffey or Mr. Kane. The women in the queue are like the women at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. They wear shawls and they're respectful to Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane because if they're not they might be told go away and come back next week when it's this minute you need the public assistance or a docket to see the doctor. Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane love to have a good laugh with the women. They'll decide if you're desperate enough for the public assistance or if you're sick enough to see a doctor. You have to tell them in front of everyone what's wrong with you and they often have a good laugh with that. They'll say, And what is it you want, Mrs. O'Shea? A docket for the doctor, is it? And what is your trouble, Mrs. O'Shea? A pain, is it? A touch of the wind, maybe. Or maybe too much cabbage. Oh, the cabbage will do it right enough. They laugh and Mrs. O'Shea laughs and all the women laugh and say Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane are funny men, they'd give Laurel and Hardy a run for their money.\nMr. Coffey says, Now, woman, what's your name? Angela McCourt, sir.\nAnd what's up with you?\n'Tis my son, sir. He has two bad eyes.\nOh, by God, he does, woman. They're desperate looking eyes altogether. They look like two rising suns. The Japs could use him on their flag, ha ha ha. Did he pour acid on his face or what?\n'Tis some class of infection, sir. He had the typhoid last year and then this came.\nAll right, all right, we don't need the life story. Here's your docket to Dr. Troy.\nTwo long benches are filled with patients for Dr. Troy. Mam sits next to a woman who has a big sore on her nose that won't go away. I tried everything, missus, every known cure on God's lovely earth. I'm eighty-three years of age and I'd like to go to my grave healthy. Is it too much to ask that I meet my Redeemer with a healthy nose? And what's up with yourself, missus?\nMy son. The eyes.\nAh, God bless us and save us, look at them eyes. They're the sorest two eyes I ever seen in me life. I never seen that color red before.\n'Tis an infection, missus.\nSure there's a cure for that. You need the caul.\nWhat's that now?\nBabies are born with this thing on their heads, a class of a hood, rare and magical. Get a caul and put that on his head any day that has a three in it, make him hold his breath for three minutes even if you have to clap your hand over his face, sprinkle him with holy water three times head to toenail and his two eyes will shine in the dawn.\nAnd where would I get a caul?\nDon't all the midwives have cauls, missus. What's a midwife without a caul? It cures all classes of disease and keeps off more.\nMam says she'll talk to Nurse O'Halloran and see if she has a spare caul.\nDr. Troy looks at my eyes. Into the hospital with this boy at once. Take him to the eye ward at the City Home. Here's the docket to get him\nin.\nWhat does he have, Doctor?\nThe worst case of conjunctivitis I've ever seen in my life and\nsomething else in there I can't make out. He needs the eye man.\nHow long will he be in, Doctor?\nOnly God knows that. I should have seen this child weeks ago. There are twenty beds in the ward and there are men and boys with\nbandages around their heads, black patches on their eyes, thick glasses. Some walk around tapping at beds with sticks. A man cries all the time that he'll never see again, he's too young, his children are babies, he'll never see them again. Jesus Christ, oh, Jesus Christ, and the nuns are shocked at the way he takes the name of the Lord in vain. Stop that, Maurice, stop the blasphemy. You have your health. You're alive. We all have our problems. Offer it up and think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the nails in His poor hands and feet, the wound in His side. Maurice says, Oh, Jesus, look down and have pity on me. Sister Bernadette warns him if he doesn't mind his language they'll put him in a ward alone and he says, Heavenly God, and that isn't as bad as Jesus Christ so she's satisfied.\nIn the morning I have to go downstairs for drops. The nurse says, Sit in this high chair and here's a nice sweet. The doctor has a bottle with brown stuff in it. He tells me put my head back, that's right, now open up, open your eyes and he pours the stuff into my right eye and it's a flame going through my skull. The nurse says, Open the other eye, come on be a good boy, and she has to force the eyelids open so the doctor can set fire to the other side of my skull. She wipes my cheeks and tells me run along upstairs but I can barely see and I want to stick my face into an icy stream. The doctor says, Run along, be a man, be a good trooper.\nThe whole world is brown and blurry on the stairs. The other patients are sitting by their beds with dinner trays and mine is there too but I don't want it with the way my skull is raging. I sit by my bed and a boy across the way says, Hoi, don't you want your dinner? I'll take it, and he comes for it.\nI try to lie on the bed but a nurse says, Now, now, no lying on the bed in the middle of the day. Your case isn't that serious.\nI have to sit with my eyes closed and everything going brown and black, black and brown and I'm sure I must be having a dream because Lord God above, is that the little fella with the typhoid, little Frankie, the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, is that yourself, Frankie, for wasn't I promoted out of the Fever Hospital, thank God, where there's every class of disease and you never know what germs you\nmight be bringing home to the wife in your clothes and what's up with you, Frankie, and the two eyes in your head all gone brown?\nI have an infection, Seamus.\nYerra, you'll be over that before you're married, Frankie. The eyes need exercise. The blink is great value for the eyes. I had an uncle with bad eyes and the blink saved him. He sat an hour ever day and blinked and it stood to him in the end. Wound up with powerful eyes, so he did.\nI want to ask him more about the blink and the powerful eyes but he says, Now do you remember the poem, Frankie, the lovely poem of Patricia? He stands in the aisle between the beds with his mop and his bucket\nand says the highwayman poem and all the patients stop their moaning and the nuns and nurses stand and listen and on and on goes Seamus till he comes to the end and everyone goes mad clapping and cheering him and he tells the world he loves that poem he'll have it in his head forever no matter where he goes and if it wasn't for Frankie McCourt and his typhoid there and poor Patricia Madigan with the dipteria that's gone God rest her he'd never know the poem and there I am famous in the eye ward of the City Home Hospital and all because of Seamus.\nMam can't come to visit every day, it's a long way out, she doesn't always have the money for the bus and the walk is hard on her corns. She thinks my eyes look better though you can't tell with all that brown stuff, which looks and smells like iodine and if it's anything like iodine it must burn. Still, they say the bitterer the medicine the quicker the cure. She gets permission to take me for a walk around the grounds when the weather clears and there's a strange sight, Mr. Timoney standing against the wall where the old people are with his eyes raised to the sky. I want to talk to him and I have to ask Mam because you never know what's right or wrong in a hospital.\nMr. Timoney.\nWho is it? Who do we have?\nFrank McCourt, sir.\nFrancis, ah, Francis.\nMam says, I'm his mother, Mr. Timoney.\nWell, then, the two of ye are blessed. I have neither kith nor kin\nnor Macushla my dog. And what are you doing in this place, Francis?\nI have an infection in my eyes.\nAh, Jesus, Francis, not the eyes, not the eyes. Mother of Christ,\nyou're too young for that.\nMr. Timoney, would you like me to read to you?\nWith them eyes, Francis? Ah, no, son, Save the eyes. I'm beyond\nreading. In my head I have everything I need. I was smart enough to put things in my head in my youth and now I have a library in my head. The English shot my wife. The Irish put down my poor innocent Macushla. Isn't it a joke of a world?\nMam says, Terrible world but God is good.\nIndeed, missus. God made the world, it's a terrible world, but God is good. Good-bye, Francis. Rest your eyes and then read till they fall out of your head. We had good times with old Jonathan Swift, didn't we, Francis?\nWe did, Mr. Timoney.\nMam takes me back to the eye ward. She tells me, Don't be crying over Mr. Timoney, he's not even your father. Besides you'll be ruining your eyes.\nSeamus comes to the ward three times a week and brings new poems in his head. He says, You made Patricia sad, Frankie, when you didn't like the one about the owl and the pussycat.\nI'm sorry, Seamus.\nI have it in my head, Frankie, and I'll say it for you if you don't say 'tis foolish.\nI won't, Seamus.\nHe says the poem and everyone in the ward loves it. They want the words and he says it three more times till the whole ward is saying, The Owl and the Pussy cat went to sea In a beautiful pea-green boat.\nThey took some honey, and plenty of money Wrapped up in a five-pound note.\nThe Owl looked up to the stars above,\nAnd sang to a small guitar,\nO lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,\nWhat a beautiful Pussy you are,\nYou are,\nYou are.\nWhat a beautiful Pussy you are.\nThey say it along with Seamus now and when it's finished they cheer and clap and Seamus laughs, delighted with himself. When he's gone with his mop and bucket you can hear them at all hours of the day and night O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love, What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are.\nWhat a beautiful Pussy you are.\nThen Seamus comes with no mop and no bucket and I'm afraid he's sacked over the poetry but he's smiling and telling me he's off to England to work in a factory and earn decent wages for a change. He'll work for two months and bring the wife over and God might be pleased to send them children for he has to do something with all the poems in his head and what better than saying them to small ones in memory of that sweet Patricia Madigan dead of the dipteria.\nGood-bye, Francis. If I had the right fist I'd write to you but I'll get the wife to write when she comes over. I might even learn to read and write myself so that the child that comes won't have a fool for a father.\nI want to cry but you can't cry in the eye ward with brown stuff in your eyes and nurses saying, What's this what's this be a man, and nuns going on, Offer it up, think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the lance in the side, the hands and feet torn to bits with nails.\nI'm a month in the hospital and the doctor says I can go home even if there's still a bit of infection but if I keep the eyes clean with soap and clean towels and build up my health with nourishing food plenty of beef and eggs I'll have a pair of sparkling eyes in no time ha ha.\nMr. Downes across the way comes back from England for his mother's funeral. He tells Mrs. Downes about my father. She tells Bridey Hannon and Bridey tells my mother. Mr. Downes says that Malachy McCourt is gone pure mad with the drink, that he squanders his wages in pubs all over Coventry, that he sings Irish rebel songs which the English don't mind because they're used to the way the Irish carry on about the hundreds of years of suffering, but they won't put up with any man that stands up in\na pub and insults the King and Queen of England, their two lovely daughters and the Queen Mother herself. Insulting the Queen Mother is going beyond the beyonds. What did she ever do to anyone, that poor old lady? Time after time Malachy drinks away his rent money and winds up sleeping in parks when the landlord throws him out. He's a regular disgrace, so he is, and Mr. Downes is glad McCourt is not a Limerickman bringing shame to this ancient city. The magistrates in Coventry are losing their patience and if Malachy McCourt doesn't stop the bloody nonsense he'll be kicked out of the country entirely.\nMam tells Bridey she doesn't know what she's going to do with these stories from England, she never felt so desperate in her life. She can see Kathleen O'Connell doesn't want to give any more credit at the shop and her own mother barks at her if she asks for the loan of a shilling and the St. Vincent de Paul Society want to know when she'll stop asking for charity especially with a husband in England. She's ashamed of the way we look with the dirty old torn shirts, raggedy ganseys, broken shoes, holes in our stockings. She lies awake at night thinking the most merciful thing of all would be to put the four boys in an orphanage so that she could go to England herself and find some type of work where she could bring us all over in a year for the better life. There might be bombs but she'd prefer bombs anytime to the shame of begging from this one and that one.\nNo, no matter what she can't bear the thought of putting us in the orphanage. That might be all right if you had the likes of Boys' Town in America with a nice priest like Spencer Tracy but you could never trust the Christian Brothers out in Glin who get their exercise beating boys and starving the life out of them.\nMam says there's nothing left but the Dispensary and the public assistance, the relief, and she's ashamed of her life to go and ask for it. It means you're at the end of your rope and maybe one level above tinkers, knackers and street beggars in general. It means you have to crawl before Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane and thank God the Dispensary is at the other end of Limerick so that people in our lane won't know we're getting the relief.\nShe knows from other women it's wise to be there early in the morning when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane might be in a good mood. If you go late in the morning they're liable to be cranky after seeing hundreds of men women and children sick and asking for help. She will take us with her to prove she has four children to feed. She gets us up early and tells us for once in our lives don't wash our faces, don't comb our hair, dress in any old rag. She tells me give my sore eyes a good rub and make them as red as I can for the worse you look at the Dispensary the more pity you get and the better your chances of getting the public assistance. She complains that Malachy Michael and Alphie look too healthy and you'd wonder why on this day of days they couldn't have their usual scabby knees or the odd cut bruise or black eye. If we meet anyone in the lane or the streets of Limerick we are not to tell them where we're going. She feels ashamed enough without telling the whole world and wait till her own mother hears.\nThere is a queue already outside the Dispensary. There are women like Mam with children in their arms, babies like Alphie, and children playing on the pavement. The women comfort the babies against the cold and scream at the ones playing in case they run into the street and get hit by a motor car or a bicycle. There are old men and women huddled\nagainst the wall talking to themselves or not talking at all. Mam warns us not to wander from her and we wait half an hour for the big door to open. A man tells us move inside in proper order and queue up before the platform, that Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane will be there in a minute when they finish their tea in the room beyond. A woman complains her children are freezing with the cold and couldn't Coffey and Kane bloody well hurry up with their tea. The man says she's a troublemaker but he won't take her name this time with the cold that's in the morning but if there's another word she'll be a sorry woman.\nMr. Coffey and Mr. Kane get up on the platform and pay no attention to the people. Mr. Kane puts on his glasses, takes them off, polishes them, puts them on, looks at the ceiling. Mr. Coffey reads papers, writes something, passes papers to Mr. Kane. They whisper to each other. They take their time. They don't look at us.\nThen Mr. Kane calls the first old man to the platform. What's your\nname?\nTimothy Creagh, sir.\nCreagh, hah? A fine old Limerick name you have there.\nI do, sir. Indeed I do.\nAnd what do you want, Creagh?\nAh, sure, I do be havin' them pains in me stomach again an' I'd\nlike to see Dr. Feeley.\nWell, now, Creagh, are you sure it's not the pints of porter that\nare going against your stomach.\nAh, no, indeed, sir. Sure I hardly touch the pint at all with the\npains. My wife is home in the bed and I have to take care of her too. There's great laziness in the world, Creagh. And Mr. Kane says to\nthe people on the queue, Did ye hear that, ladies? Great laziness, isn't there?\nAnd the women say, Oh, there is, indeed, Mr. Kane, great laziness. Mr. Creagh gets his docket to see the doctor, the queue moves ahead\nand Mr. Kane is ready for Mam.\nThe public assistance, is\n'Tis, Mr. Kane.\nAnd where's your husband?\nOh, he's in England, but-\nEngland, is it? And where\nthat what you want, woman, the relief?\nis the weekly telegram, the big five\npounds?\nHe didn't send us a penny in months, Mr. Kane.\nIs that a fact? Well, we know why, don't we? We know what the men\nof Ireland are up to in England. We know there's the occasional Limerickman seen trotting around with a Piccadilly tart, don't we?\nHe looks out at the people on the queue and they know they're supposed to say, We do, Mr. Kane, and they know they're supposed to smile and laugh or things will go hard with them when they reach the platform. They know he might turn them over to Mr. Coffey and he's notorious for saying no to everything.\nMam tells Mr. Kane that Dad is in Coventry and nowhere near Piccadilly and Mr. Kane takes off his glasses and stares at her. What's this? Are we having a little contradiction here?\nOh, no, Mr. Kane, God no.\nI want you to know, woman, that it is the policy here to give no relief to women with husbands in England. I want you to know you're\ntaking the bread from the mouths of more deserving people who stayed in this country to do their bit.\nOh, yes, Mr. Kane.\nAnd what's your name?\nMcCourt, sir.\nThat's not a Limerick name. Where did you get a name like that? My husband, sir. He's from the North.\nHe's from the North and he leaves you here to get the relief from\nthe Irish Free State. Is this what we fought for, is it? I don't know, sir.\nWhy don't you go up to Belfast and see what the Orangemen will do for you, ah?\nI don't know, sir.\nYou don't know. Of course you don't know. There's great ignorance in the world.\nHe looks out at the people, I said there's great ignorance in the world, and the people nod their heads and agree there's great ignorance in the world.\nHe whispers to Mr. Coffey and they look at Mam, they look at us. He tells Mam at last that she can have the public assistance but if she gets a single penny from her husband she's to drop all claims and give the money back to the Dispensary. She promises she will and we leave.\nWe follow her to Kathleen O'Connell's shop to get tea and bread and a few sods of turf for the fire. We climb the stairs to Italy and get the fire going and it's cozy when we have our tea. We're all very quiet, even the baby Alphie, because we know what Mr. Kane did to our mother.\nX\nIt's cold and wet down in Ireland but we're up in Italy. Mam says we should bring the poor Pope up to hang on the wall opposite the window. After all he's a friend of the workingman, he's Italian, and they're a warm weather people. Mam sits by the fire, shivering, and we know something is wrong when she makes no move for a cigarette. She says she feels a cold coming and she'd love to have a tarty drink, a lemonade. But there's no money in the house, not even for bread in the morning. She drinks tea and goes to bed.\nThe bed creaks all night with her twistings and turnings and she keeps us awake with her moaning for water. In the morning, she stays in bed, still shivering, and we keep quiet. If she sleeps long enough Malachy and I will be too late for school. Hours pass and still she makes no move and when I know it's well past school time I start the fire for the kettle. She stirs and calls for lemonade but I give her a jam jar of water. I ask her if she'd like some tea and she acts like a woman gone deaf. She looks flushed and it's odd she doesn't even mention cigarettes.\nWe sit quietly by the fire, Malachy, Michael, Alphie, myself. We drink our tea while Alphie chews the last bit of bread covered with sugar. He makes us laugh the way he smears the sugar all over his face and grins at us with his fat sticky cheeks. But we can't laugh too much or Mam will jump out of the bed and order Malachy and me off to school where we'll be killed for being late. We don't laugh long, there is no more bread and we're hungry, the four of us. We can get no more credit at\nO'Connell's shop. We can't go near Grandma, either. She yells at us all the time because Dad is from the North and he never sends money home from England where he is working in a munitions factory. Grandma says we could starve to death for all he cares. That would teach Mam a lesson for marrying a man from the North with sallow skin, an odd manner and a look of the Presbyterian about him.\nStill, I'll have to try Kathleen O'Connell once more. I'll tell her my mother is sick above in the bed, my brothers are starving and we'll all be dead for the want of bread.\nI put on my shoes and run quickly through the streets of Limerick to keep myself warm against the February frost. You can look in people's windows and see how cozy it is in their kitchens with fires glowing or ranges black and hot everything bright in the electric light cups and saucers on the tables with plates of sliced bread pounds of butter jars of jam smells of fried eggs and rashers coming through the windows enough to make the water run in your mouth and families sitting there digging in all smiling the mother crisp and clean in her apron everyone washed and the Sacred Heart of Jesus looking down on them from the wall suffering and sad but still happy with all that food and light and good Catholics at their breakfast.\nI try to find music in my own head but all I can find is my mother moaning for lemonade.\nLemonade. There's a van pulling away from South's pub leaving crates of beer and lemonade outside and there isn't a soul on the street. In a second I have two bottles of lemonade up under my jersey and I saunter away trying to look innocent.\nThere's a bread van outside Kathleen O'Connell's shop. The back door is open on shelves of steaming newly baked bread. The van driver is inside the shop having tea and a bun with Kathleen and it's no trouble for me to help myself to a loaf of bread. It's wrong to steal from Kathleen with the way she's always good to us but if I go in and ask her for bread she'll be annoyed and tell me I'm ruining her morning cup of tea, which she'd like to have in peace ease and comfort thank you. It's easier to stick the bread up under my jersey with the lemonade and promise to tell everything in confession.\nMy brothers are back in bed playing games under the overcoats but they jump when they see the bread. We tear at the loaf because we're too hungry to slice it and we make tea from this morning's leaves. When my mother stirs Malachy holds the lemonade bottle to her lips and she gasps till she finishes it. If she likes it that much I'll have to find more lemonade.\nWe put the last of the coal on the fire and sit around telling stories which we make up the way Dad did. I tell my brothers about my adventures with the lemonade and bread and I make up stories about how I was chased by pub owners and shopkeepers and how I ran into St. Joseph's Church where no one can follow you if you're a criminal, not even if you killed your own mother. Malachy and Michael look shocked over the way I got the bread and lemonade but then Malachy says it was only what Robin Hood would have done, rob the rich and give to the poor. Michael says I'm an outlaw and if they catch me they'll hang me from the highest tree in the People's Park the way outlaws are hanged in films at the Lyric Cinema. Malachy says I should make sure I'm in a state of grace because it might be hard to find a priest to come to my hanging. I tell him a priest would have to come to the hanging. That's what priests are for.\nRoddy McCorley had a priest and so did Kevin Barry. Malachy says there were no priests at the hanging of Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry because they're not mentioned in the songs and he starts singing the songs to prove it till my mother groans in the bed and says shut up.\nAlphie the baby is asleep on the floor by the fire. We put him into the bed with Mam so that he'll be warm though we don't want him to catch her disease and die. If she wakes up and finds him dead in the bed beside her there will be no end to the lamentations and she'll blame me on top of it.\nThe three of us get back into our own bed, huddling under the overcoats and trying not to roll into the hole in the mattress. It's pleasant there till Michael starts to worry over Alphie getting Mam's disease and me getting hanged for an outlaw. He says it isn't fair because that would leave him with only one brother and everyone in the world has brothers galore. He falls asleep from the worry and soon Malachy drifts off and I lie there thinking of jam. Wouldn't it be lovely to have another loaf of bread and a jar of strawberry jam or any kind of jam. I can't remember ever seeing a jam van making a delivery and I wouldn't want to be like Jesse James blasting my way into a shop demanding jam. That would surely lead to a hanging.\nThere's a cold sun coming through the window and I'm sure it must be warmer outside and wouldn't my brothers be surprised if they woke and found me there with more bread and jam. They'd gobble everything and then go on about my sins and the hanging.\nMam is still asleep though her face is red and there's a strangling sound when she snores.\nI have to be careful going through the street because it's a school day and if Guard Dennehy sees me he'll drag me off to school and Mr. O'Halloran will knock me all over the classroom. The guard is in charge of school attendance and he loves chasing you on his bicycle and dragging you off to school by the ear.\nThere's a box sitting outside the door of one of the big houses on Barrington Street. I pretend to knock on the door so that I can see what's in the box, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, cheese, tomatoes and, oh, God, a jar of marmalade. I can't shove all that under my jersey. Oh, God. Should I take the whole box? The people passing by pay me no attention. I might as well take the whole box. My mother would say you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I lift the box and try to look like a messenger boy making a delivery and no one says a word.\nMalachy and Michael are beside themselves when they see what's in the box and they're soon gobbling thick cuts of bread slathered with golden marmalade. Alphie has the marmalade all over his face and hair and a good bit on his legs and belly. We wash down the food with cold tea because we have no fire to heat it.\nMam mumbles again for lemonade and I give her half the second bottle to keep her quiet. She calls for more and I mix it with water to stretch it because I can't be spending my life running around lifting lemonade from pubs. We're having a fine time of it till Mam begins to rave in the bed about her lovely little daughter taken from her and her twin boys gone before they were three and why couldn't God take the rich for a change and is there any lemonade in the house? Michael wants to know if Mam will die and Malachy tells him you can't die till a priest comes. Then Michael wonders if we'll ever have a fire and hot tea again because he's freezing in the bed even with the overcoats left over from\nolden times. Malachy says we should go from house to house asking for turf and coal and wood and we could use Alphie's pram to carry the load. We should take Alphie with us because he's small and he smiles and people will see him and feel sorry for him and us. We try to wash all the dirt and lint and feathers and sticky marmalade but when we touch him with water he howls. Michael says he'll only get dirty again in the pram so what's the use of washing him. Michael is small but he's always saying remarkable things like that.\nWe push the pram out to the rich avenues and roads but when we knock on the doors the maids tell us go away or they'll call the proper authorities and it's a disgrace to be dragging a baby around in a wreck of a pram that smells to the heavens a filthy contraption that you wouldn't use to haul a pig to the slaughterhouse and this is a Catholic country where babies should be cherished and kept alive to hand down the faith from generation to generation. Malachy tells one maid to kiss his arse and she gives him such a clout the tears leap to his eyes and he says he'll never in his life ask the rich for anything again. He says there's no use asking anymore, that we should go around the backs of the houses and climb over the walls and take what we want. Michael can ring the front doorbells to keep the maids busy and Malachy and I can throw coal and turf over the walls and fill the pram all around Alphie.\nWe collect that way from three houses but then Malachy throws a piece of coal over a wall and hits Alphie and he starts screaming and we have to run forgetting Michael, still ringing doorbells and getting abuse from maids. Malachy says we should take the pram home first and then go back for Michael. We can't stop now with Alphie bawling and people giving us dirty looks and telling us we're a disgrace to our mother and Ireland in general.\nWhen we're back home it takes a while to dig Alphie out from under the load of coal and turf and he won't stop screaming till I give him bread and marmalade. I'm afraid Mam will leap from her bed but she only mumbles on about Dad and drink and babies dead.\nMalachy is back with Michael, with stories of his adventures ringing doorbells. One rich woman answered the door herself and invited him into the kitchen for cake and milk and bread and jam. She asked him all about his family and he told her his father had a big job in England but his mother is in the bed with a desperate disease and calling for lemonade morning noon and night. The rich woman wanted to know who was taking care of us and Michael bragged we were taking care of ourselves, that there was no shortage of bread and marmalade. The rich woman wrote down Michael's name and address and told him be a good boy and go home to his brothers and his mother in the bed.\nMalachy barks at Michael for being such a fool as to tell a rich woman anything. She'll go now and tell on us and before we know it we'll have the priests of the world banging on the door and disturbing us.\nThere's the banging on the door already. But it isn't a priest, it's Guard Dennehy. He calls up, Hello, hello, is anybody home? Are you there, Mrs. McCourt?\nMichael knocks on the window and waves at the guard. I give him a good kick for himself and Malachy thumps him on the head and he yells, I'll tell the guard. I'll tell the guard. They're killing me, guard. They're thumping and kicking.\nHe won't shut up and Guard Dennehy shouts at us to open the door. I call out the window and tell him I can't open the door because my mother is in bed with a terrible disease.\nWhere's your father?\nHe's in England.\nWell, I'm coming in to talk to your mother.\nYou can't. You can't. She has the disease. We all have the disease.\nIt might be the typhoid. It might be the galloping consumption. We're getting spots already. The baby has a lump. It could kill.\nHe pushes in the door and climbs the stairs to Italy just as Alphie crawls out from under the bed covered with marmalade and dirt. He looks at him and my mother and us, takes off his cap and scratches his head. He says, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, this is a desperate situation. How did your mother get sick like that?\nI tell him he shouldn't go near her and when Malachy says we might not be able to go to school for ages the guard says we'll go to school no matter what, that we're on the earth to go to school the way he's on the earth to make sure we go to school. He wants to know if we have any relations and he sends me off to tell Grandma and Aunt Aggie to come to our house.\nThey scream at me and tell me I'm filthy. I try to explain that Mam has the disease and I'm worn out trying to make ends meet, keeping the home fires burning, getting lemonade for Mam and bread for my brothers. There's no use telling them about the marmalade for they'll only scream again. There's no use telling them about the nastiness of rich people and their maids.\nThey push me all the way back to the lane, barking at me and disgracing me on the streets of Limerick. Guard Dennehy is still scratching his poll. He says, Look at this, a disgrace. You wouldn't see the likes of this in Bombay or the Bowery of New York itself.\nGrandma is wailing at my mother, Mother o' God, Angela, what's up with you in the bed? What did they do to you?\nMy mother runs her tongue over her dry lips and gasps for more lemonade.\nShe wants lemonade, says Michael, and we got it for her and bread and marmalade and we're all outlaws now. Frankie was the first outlaw till we went raiding for coal all over Limerick.\nGuard Dennehy looks interested and takes Michael downstairs by the hand and in a few minutes we hear him laughing. Aunt Aggie says that's a disgraceful way to behave with my mother sick in the bed. The guard comes back and tells her go for a doctor. He keeps covering his face with his cap whenever he looks at me or my brothers. Desperadoes, he says, desperadoes.\nThe doctor comes with Aunt Aggie in his motor car and he has to rush my mother to the hospital with her pneumonia. We'd all like to go riding in the doctor's car but Aunt Aggie says, No, ye are all coming to my house till yeer mother comes home from the hospital.\nI tell her not to bother. I'm eleven and I can easily look after my brothers. I'd be glad to stay at home from school and make sure everyone is fed and washed. But Grandma screams I will do no such a thing and Aunt Aggie gives me a thump for myself. Guard Dennehy says I'm too young yet to be an outlaw and a father but I have a promising future in both departments.\nGet your clothes, says Aunt Aggie, ye are coming to my house till yeer mother is out of the hospital. Jesus above, that baby is a disgrace.\nShe finds a rag and ties it around Alphie's bottom for fear he might shit all over the pram. Then she looks at us and wants to know why we're standing there with our faces hanging out after she told us get our clothes. I'm afraid she'll hit me or yell at me when I tell her it's all right, we have our clothes, they're on us. She stares at me and shakes her head. Here, she says, put some sugar and water in the child's bottle. She tells me I have to push Alphie through the streets, she can't manage the pram with that bockety wheel that makes it rock back and forth and besides 'tis a disgraceful looking object she'd be ashamed to put a mangy dog in. She takes the three old coats from our bed and piles them on the pram till you can hardly see Alphie at all.\nGrandma comes with us and barks at me all the way from Roden Lane to Aunt Aggie's flat in Windmill Street. Can't you push that pram properly? Jesus, you're going to kill that child. Stop goin' from side to side or I'll give you a good clitther on the gob. She won't come into Aunt Aggie's flat. She can't stand the sight of us one more minute. She's fed up with the whole McCourt clan from the days when she had to send six fares to bring us all back from America, dishing out more money for funerals for dead children, giving us food every time our father drank the dole or the wages, helping Angela carry on while that blaguard from the North drinks his wages all over England. Oh, she's fed up, so she is, and off she goes across Henry Street with her black shawl pulled up around her white head, limping along in her black high laced boots.\nWhen you're eleven and your brothers are ten, five and one, you don't know what to do when you go to someone's house even if she's your mother's sister. You're told to leave the pram in the hall and bring the baby into the kitchen but if it's not your house you don't know what to do once you get into the kitchen for fear the aunt will yell at you or hit you on the skull. She takes off her coat and takes it to the bedroom and you stand with the baby in your arms waiting to be told. If you take one step forward or one step to the side she might come out and say where are you going and you don't know what to answer because you don't know yourself. If you say anything to your brothers she might say who do you think you're talking to in my kitchen? We have to stand and be quiet and that's hard when there's a tinkling sound from the bedroom and we know she's on the chamber pot peeing away. I don't want to look at Malachy. If I do I'll smile and he'll smile and Michael will smile and there's danger we'll start laughing and if we do we won't be able to stop for days at the picture in our heads of Aunt Aggie's big white bum perched on a flowery little chamber pot. I'm able to control myself. I won't laugh. Malachy and Michael won't laugh and it's easy to see we're all proud of ourselves for not laughing and getting into trouble with Aunt Aggie till Alphie in my arms smiles and says Goo goo and that sets us off. The three of us burst out laughing and Alphie grins with his dirty face and says Goo goo again till we're helpless and Aunt Aggie roars out of the room pulling her dress down and gives me a thump on the head that sends me against the wall baby and all. She hits Malachy too and she tries to hit Michael but he runs to the other side of her round table and she can't get at him. Come over here, she says, and I'll wipe that grin off your puss, but Michael keeps running around the table and she's too fat to catch him. I'll get you later, she says, I'll warm your arse, and you, Lord Muck, she says to me, put that child down on the floor over there by\nthe range. She puts the old coats from the pram on the floor and Alphie lies there with his sugary water and says Goo goo and smiles. She tells us take off every scrap of our clothes, get out to the tap in the backyard and scrub every inch of our bodies. We are not to come back into this house till we're spotless. I want to tell her it's the middle of February, it's freezing outside, we could all die, but I know if I open my mouth I might die right here on the kitchen floor.\nWe're out in the yard naked dousing ourselves with icy water from the tap. She opens the kitchen window and throws out a scrub brush and a big bar of brown soap like the one they used on Finn the Horse. She orders us to scrub each other's backs and don't stop till she tells us. Michael says his hands and feet are falling off with the cold but she doesn't care. She keeps telling us we're still dirty and if she has to come out to scrub us we'll rue the day. Another rue. I scrub myself harder. We all scrub till we're pink and our jaws chatter. It's not enough for Aunt Aggie. She comes out with a bucket and sloshes cold water all over us. Now, she says, get inside and dry yeerselves. We stand in the little shed next to her kitchen drying ourselves with one towel. We stand and shiver and wait because you can't go marching into her kitchen till she tells you. We hear her inside starting the fire, rattling the poker in the range, then yelling at us, Are ye goin' to stand in there all day? Come in here and put on yeer clothes.\nShe gives us mugs of tea and cuts of fried bread and we sit at the table eating quietly because you're not supposed to say a word unless she tells you. Michael asks her for a second cut of fried bread and we expect her to knock him off the chair for his cheek but she just grumbles, 'Tis far from two cuts of fried bread ye were brought up, and gives each of us another cut. She tries to feed Alphie bread soaked in tea but he won't eat it till she sprinkles it with sugar and when he's finished he smiles and pees all over her lap and we're delighted. She runs out to the shed to dab at herself with a towel and we're able to grin at each other at the table and tell Alphie he's the champion baby in the world. Uncle Pa Keating comes in the door all black from his job at the gas works. Oh, bejay, he says, what's this?\nMichael says, My mother is in the hospital, Uncle Pa. Is that so? What's up with her?\nPneumonia, says Malachy.\nWell, now, that's better than oldmonia.\nWe don't know what he's laughing at and Aunt Aggie comes in from the shed and tells him how Mam is in the hospital and we're to stay with them till she gets out. He says, Grand, grand, and goes to the shed to wash himself though when he comes back you'd never know he touched himself with water at all he's that black.\nHe sits at the table and Aunt Aggie gives him his supper, which is fried bread and ham and sliced tomatoes. She tells us get away from the table and stop gawking at him having his tea and tells him to stop giving us bits of ham and tomato. He says, Arrah, for Jaysus sake, Aggie, the children are hungry, and she says, 'Tis none of your business. They're not yours. She tells us go out and play and be home for bed by half-past eight. We know it's freezing outside and we'd like to stay in by that warm range but it's easier to be in the streets playing than inside with Aunt Aggie and her nagging.\nShe calls me in later and sends me upstairs to borrow a rubber sheet from a woman who had a child that died. The woman says tell your\naunt I'd like that rubber sheet back for the next child. Aunt Aggie says, Twelve years ago that child died and she still keeps the rubber sheet. Forty-five she is now and if there's another child we'll have to look for a star in the East. Malachy says, What's that? and she tells him mind his own business, he's too young.\nAunt Aggie places the rubber sheet on her bed and puts Alphie on it between herself and Uncle Pa. She sleeps inside against the wall and Uncle Pa outside because he has to get up in the morning for work. We are to sleep on the floor against the opposite wall with one coat under us and two over. She says if she hears a word out of us during the night she'll warm our arses and we're to be up early in the morning because it's Ash Wednesday and it wouldn't do us any harm to go to Mass and pray for our poor mother and her pneumonia.\nThe alarm clock shocks us out of our sleep. Aunt Aggie calls from her bed, The three of ye are to get up and go to Mass. Do ye hear me? Up. Wash yeer faces and go to the Jesuits.\nHer backyard is all frost and ice and our hands sting from the tap water. We throw a little on our faces and dry with the towel that's still damp from yesterday. Malachy whispers our wash was a lick and a promise, that's what Mam would say.\nThe streets are frosty and icy, too, but the Jesuit church is warm. It must be grand to be a Jesuit, sleeping in a bed with sheets blankets pillows and getting up to a nice warm house and a warm church with nothing to do but say Mass hear confessions and yell at people for their sins have your meals served up to you and read your Latin office before you go to sleep. I'd like to be a Jesuit some day but there's no hope of that when you grow up in a lane. Jesuits are very particular. They don't like poor people. They like people with motor cars who stick out their little fingers when they pick up their teacups.\nThe church is crowded with people at seven o'clock Mass getting the ashes on their foreheads. Malachy whispers that Michael shouldn't get the ashes because he won't be making his First Communion till May and it would be a sin. Michael starts to cry, I want the ashes, I want the ashes. An old woman behind us says, What are ye doin' to that lovely child? Malachy explains the lovely child never made his First Communion and he's not in a state of grace. Malachy is getting ready for Confirmation himself, always showing off his knowledge of the catechism, always going on about state of grace. He won't admit I knew all about the state of grace a year ago, so long ago I'm starting to forget it. The old woman says you don't have to be in a state of grace to get a few ashes on your forehead and tells Malachy stop tormenting his poor little brother. She pats Michael on the head and tells him he's a lovely child and go up there and get your ashes. He runs to the altar and when he comes back the woman gives him a penny to go with his ashes.\nAunt Aggie is still in the bed with Alphie. She tells Malachy to fill Alphie's bottle with milk and bring it to him. She tells me to start the fire in the range, that there's paper and wood in a box and coal in the coal scuttle. If the fire won't start sprinkle it with a little paraffin oil. The fire is slow and smoky and I sprinkle it with the paraffin oil, it flares up, whoosh, and nearly takes my eyebrows off. There is smoke everywhere and Aunt Aggie rushes into the kitchen. She shoves me away from the range. Jesus above, can't you do anything right? You're supposed to open the damper, you eejit.\nI don't know anything about dampers. In our house we have a fireplace in Ireland downstairs and a fireplace in Italy upstairs and no sign of a damper. Then you go to your aunt's house and you're supposed to know all about dampers. There's no use telling her this is the first time you ever lit a fire in a range. She'll just give you another thump on the skull and send you flying. It's hard to know why grown people get so angry over little things like dampers. When I'm a man I won't go around thumping small children over dampers or anything else. Now she yells at me, Look at Lord Muck standing there. Would you ever think of opening the window and letting out the smoke? Of course you wouldn't. You have a puss on you like your father from the North. Do you think now you can boil the water for the tea without burning the house down?\nShe cuts three slices from a loaf, smears them with margarine for us and goes back to bed. We have the tea and bread and it's one morning we're glad to go to school where it's warm and there are no yelling aunts.\nAfter school she tells me sit at the table and write my father a letter about Mam in the hospital and how we're all at Aunt Aggie's till Mam comes home. I'm to tell him we're all happy and in the best of health, send money, food is very dear, growing boys eat a lot, ha ha, Alphie the baby needs clothes and nappies.\nI don't know why she's always angry. Her flat is warm and dry. She has electric light in the house and her own lavatory in the backyard. Uncle Pa has a steady job and he brings home his wages every Friday. He drinks his pints at South's pub but never comes home singing songs of Ireland's long woeful history. He says, A pox on all their houses, and he says the funniest thing in the world is that we all have arses that have to be wiped and no man escapes that. The minute a politician or a Pope starts his blather Uncle Pa thinks of him wiping his arse. Hitler and Roosevelt and Churchill all wipe their arses. De Valera, too. He says the only people you can trust in that department are the Mahommedans for they eat with one hand and wipe with the other. The human hand itself is a sneaky bugger and you never know what it's been up to.\nThere are good times with Uncle Pa when Aunt Aggie goes to the Mechanics' Institute to play cards, forty-five. He says, To hell with the begrudgers. He gets himself two bottles of stout from South's, six buns and a half pound of ham from the shop on the corner. He makes tea and we sit by the range drinking it, eating our ham sandwiches and buns and laughing over Uncle Pa and the way he goes on about the world. He says, I swallowed the gas, I drink the pint, I don't give a fiddler's fart about the world and its cousin. If little Alphie gets tired and cranky and cries Uncle Pa pulls his shirt back from his chest and tells him, Here, have a suck of diddy momma. The sight of that flat chest and the nipple shocks Alphie and makes him good again.\nBefore Aunt Aggie comes home we have to wash the mugs and clean up so she won't know we were stuffing ourselves with buns and ham sandwiches. She'd nag Uncle Pa for a month if she ever found out and that's what I don't understand. Why does he let her nag him like that? He went to the Great War, he was gassed, he's big, he has a job, he makes the world laugh. It's a mystery. That's what the priests and the masters tell you, everything is a mystery and you have to believe what you're told.\nI could easily have Uncle Pa for a father. We'd have great times sitting by the fire in the range drinking tea and laughing over the way he farts and says, Light a match. That's a present from the Germans.\nAunt Aggie torments me all the time. She calls me scabby eyes. She says I'm the spitting image of my father, I have the odd manner, I have the sneaky air of a northern Presbyterian, I'll probably grow up and build an altar to Oliver Cromwell himself, I'll run off and marry an English tart and cover my house with pictures of the royal family.\nI want to get away from her and I can think of only one way, to make myself sick and go to the hospital. I get up in the middle of the night and go to her backyard. I can pretend I'm going to the lavatory. I stand out in the open in the freezing weather and hope I'll catch pneumonia or the galloping consumption so that I'll go to the hospital with the nice clean sheets and the meals in the bed and books brought by the girl in the blue dress. I might meet another Patricia Madigan and learn a long poem. I stand in the backyard for ages in my shirt and bare feet looking up at the moon which is a ghostly galleon riding upon cloudy seas and go back to bed shivering hoping I'll wake up in the morning with a terrible cough and flushed cheeks. But I don't. I feel fresh and lively and I'd be in great form if I could be at home with my mother and brothers.\nThere are days when Aunt Aggie tells us she can't stand the sight of us another minute, Get away from me. Here, scabby eyes, take Alphie out in his pram, take your brothers, go to the park and play, do anything ye like and don't come back till teatime when the Angelus is ringing, not a minute later, do ye hear me, not a minute later. It's cold but we don't care. We push the pram up O'Connell Avenue out to Ballinacurra or the Rosbrien Road. We let Alphie crawl around in fields to look at cows and sheep and we laugh when the cows nuzzle him. I get under the cows and squirt the milk into Alphie's mouth till he's full and throws it up. Farmers chase us till they see how small Michael and Alphie are. Malachy laughs at the farmers. He says, Hit me now with the child in me arms. Then he has a great notion, Why can't we go to our own house and play a while? We find twigs and bits of wood in the fields and rush to Roden Lane. There are matches by the fireplace in Italy and we have a good fire going in no time. Alphie falls asleep and soon the rest of us drift off till the Angelus booms out of the Redemptorist church and we know we're in trouble with Aunt Aggie for being late.\nWe don't care. She can yell at us all she wants but we had a grand time out the country with the cows and the sheep and then the lovely fire above in Italy.\nYou can tell she never has grand times like that. Electric light and a lavatory but no grand times.\nGrandma comes for her on Thursdays and Sundays and they take the bus to the hospital to see Mam. We can't go because children are not allowed and if we say, How's Mam? they look cranky and tell us she's all right, she'll live. We'd like to know when she's getting out of hospital so that we can all go back home but we're afraid to open our mouths.\nMalachy tells Aunt Aggie one day he's hungry and could he have a piece of bread. She hits him with a rolled up Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart and there are tears on his eyelashes. He doesn't come home from school the next day and he's still gone at bedtime. Aunt Aggie says, Well, I suppose he ran away. Good riddance. If he was hungry he'd be here. Let him find comfort in a ditch.\nNext day Michael runs in from the street, Dad's here, Dad's here, and runs back out and there's Dad sitting on the hall floor hugging Michael, crying, Your poor mother, your poor mother, and there's a smell of drink on him. Aunt Aggie is smiling, Oh, you're here, and she makes tea and eggs and sausages. She sends me out for a bottle of stout for Dad and I wonder why she's so pleasant and generous all of a sudden. Michael says, Are we going to our own house, Dad?\nWe are, son.\nAlphie is back in the pram with the three old coats and coal and wood for the fire. Aunt Aggie stands at her door and tells us be good boys, come back for tea anytime, and there's a bad word for her in my head, Oul' bitch. It's in my head and I can't help it and I'll have to tell the priest in confession.\nMalachy isn't in a ditch, he's there in our own house eating fish and chips a drunken soldier dropped at the gate of the Sarsfield Barracks.\nMam comes home in two days. She's weak and white and walks slowly. She says, The doctor told me keep warm, have plenty of rest and nourishing food, meat and eggs three times a week. God help us, those poor doctors don't have a notion of not having. Dad makes tea and toasts bread for her on the fire. He fries bread for the rest of us and we have a lovely night up in Italy where it's warm. He says he can't stay forever, he has to go back to work in Coventry. Mam wonders how he'll get to Coventry without a penny in his pocket. He's up early on Holy Saturday and I have tea with him by the fire. He fries four cuts of bread and wraps them in pages of the Limerick Chronicle, two cuts in each coat pocket. Mam is still in bed and he calls to her from the bottom of the stairs, I'm going now. She says, All right. Write when you land. My father is going to England and she won't even get out of the bed. I ask if I can go with him to the railway station. No, he's not going there. He's going to the Dublin road to see if he can get a lift. He pats my head, tells me take care of my mother and brothers and goes out the door. I watch him go up the lane till he turns the corner. I run up the lane to see him go down Barrack Hill and down St. Joseph's Street. I run down the hill and follow him as far as I can. He must know I'm following him because he turns and calls to me, Go home, Francis. Go home to your mother.\nIn a week there's a letter to say he arrived safely, that we are to be good boys, attend to our religious duties and above all obey our mother. In another week there's a telegram money order for three pounds and we're in heaven. We'll be rich, there will be fish and chips, jelly and custard, films every Saturday at the Lyric, the Coliseum, the Carlton, the Atheneum, the Central and the fanciest of all, the Savoy. We might even wind up having tea and cakes at the Savoy Caf\u00e9 with the nobs and toffs of Limerick. We'll be sure to hold our teacups with our little fingers sticking out.\nThe next Saturday there's no telegram nor the Saturday after nor any Saturday forever. Mam begs again at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and smiles at the Dispensary when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane have their bit of a joke about Dad having a tart in Piccadilly. Michael wants to know what a tart is and she tells him it's something you have with tea. She spends most of the day by the fire with Bridey Hannon puffing on her Woodlbines, drinking weak tea. The bread crumbs from the morning are always on the table when we come home from school. She never washes the\njam jars or mugs and there are flies in the sugar and wherever there is sweetness.\nShe says Malachy and I have to take turns looking after Alphie, taking him out in the pram for a bit of fresh air. The child can't be kept in Italy from October to April. If we tell her we want to play with our pals she might let fly with a right cross to the head that stings the ears.\nWe play games with Alphie and the pram. I stand at the top of Barrack Hill and Malachy is at the bottom. When I give the pram a push down the hill Malachy is supposed to stop it but he's looking at a pal on roller skates and it speeds by him across the street and through the doors of Leniston's pub where men are having a peaceful pint and not expecting a pram with a dirty faced child saying Goo goo goo goo. The barman shouts this is a disgrace, there must be a law against this class of behavior, babies roaring through the door in bockety prams, he'll call the guards on us, and Alphie waves at him and smiles and he says, all right, all right, the child can have a sweet and a lemonade, the brothers can have lemonade too, that raggedy pair, and God above, 'tis a hard world, the minute you think you're getting ahead a pram comes crashing through the door and you're dishing out sweets and lemonade right and left, the two of ye take that child and go home to yeer mother.\nMalachy has another powerful idea, that we could go around Limerick like tinkers pushing Alphie in his pram into pubs for the sweets and lemonade, but I don't want Mam finding out and hitting me with her right cross. Malachy says I'm not a sport and runs off. I push the pram over to Henry Street and up by the Redemptorist church. It's a gray day, the church is gray and the small crowd of people outside the door of the priests' house is gray. They're waiting to beg for any food left over from the priests' dinner.\nThere in the middle of the crowd in her dirty gray coat is my mother.\nThis is my own mother, begging. This is worse than the dole, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Dispensary. It's the worst kind of shame, almost as bad as begging on the streets where the tinkers hold up their scabby children, Give us a penny for the poor child, mister, the poor child is hungry, missus.\nMy mother is a beggar now and if anyone from the lane or my school sees her the family will be disgraced entirely. My pals will make up new names and torment me in the schoolyard and I know what they'll say, Frankie McCourt beggar woman's boy scabby-eyed dancing blubber-gob Jap.\nThe door of the priests' house swings open and the people rush with their hands out. I can hear them, Brother, brother, here, brother, ah, for the love o' God, brother. Five children at home, brother. I can see my own mother pushed along. I can see the tightness of her mouth when she snatches at a bag and turns from the door and I push the pram up the street before she can see me.\nI don't want to go home anymore. I push the pram down to the Dock Road, out to Corkanree where all the dust and garbage of Limerick is dumped and burned. I stand a while and look at boys chase rats. I don't know why they have to torture rats that are not in their houses. I'd keep going on into the country forever if I didn't have Alphie bawling with the hunger, kicking his chubby legs, waving his empty bottle.\nMam has the fire going and something boiling in a pot. Malachy smiles and says she brought home corned beef and a few spuds from\nKathleen O'Connell's shop. He wouldn't be so happy if he knew he was the son of a beggar. She calls us in from the lane and when we sit at the table it's hard for me to look at my mother the beggar. She lifts the pot to the table, spoons out the potatoes one each and uses a fork to lift out the corned beef.\nIt isn't corned beef at all. It's a great lump of quivering gray fat and the only sign of corned beef is a little nipple of red meat on top. We stare at that bit of meat and wonder who will get it. Mam says, That's for Alphie. He's a baby, he's growing fast, he needs it. She puts it on a saucer in front of him. He pushes it away with his finger, then pulls it back. He lifts it to his mouth, looks around the kitchen, sees Lucky the dog and throws it to him.\nThere's no use saying anything. The meat is gone. We eat our potatoes with plenty of salt and I eat my fat and pretend it's that nipple of red meat.\nXI\nMam warns us, Ye are to keep yeer paws out of that trunk for there's nothing in there that's of the slightest interest or any of yeer business.\nAll she has in that trunk is a lot of papers, certificates of birth and baptism, her Irish passport, Dad's English passport from Belfast, our American passports and her bright red flapper dress with spangles and black frills she brought all the way from America. She wants to keep that dress forever to remind herself she was young and dancing.\nI don't care what she has in the trunk till I start a football team with Billy Campbell and Malachy. We can't afford uniforms or boots and Billy says, How will the world know who we are? We don't even have a name.\nI remember the red dress and a name comes to me, The Red Hearts of Limerick. Mam never opens the trunk so what does it matter if I cut off a piece of the dress to make seven red hearts we can stick on our chests? What you don't know won't bother you, she always says herself.\nThe dress is buried under the papers. I look at my passport picture when I was small and I can see why they call me Jap. There's a paper that says Marriage Certificate, that Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan were joined in Holy Matrimony on the twenty-eighth of March, 1930. How could that be? I was born on the nineteenth of August and Billy Campbell told me the father and mother have to be married nine months before there's a sign of a child. Here I am born into the world in half the time. That means I must be a miracle and I might grow up to be a saint with people celebrating the feast of St. Francis of Limerick.\nI'll have to ask Mikey Molloy, still the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.\nBilly says if we're to be great soccer players we have to practice and we're to meet over in the park. The boys complain when I hand out the hearts and I tell them if they don't like it they can go home and cut up their own mother's dresses and blouses.\nWe have no money for a proper ball so one of the boys brings a sheep's bladder stuffed with rags. We kick the bladder up and down the meadow till there are holes and rags start falling out and we get fed up\nkicking a bladder that's hardly there anymore. Billy says we're to meet tomorrow morning which is Saturday and go out Ballinacurra to see if we can challenge rich Crescent College boys to a proper game, seven a side. He says we're to pin our red hearts to our shirts even if they're red rags.\nMalachy is going home for tea but I can't go because I have to see Mikey Molloy and find out why I was born in half the time. Mikey is coming out of his house with his father, Peter. It's Mikey's sixteenth birthday and his father is taking him to Bowles's pub for his first pint. Nora Molloy is inside screeching after Peter that if they go they can stay gone, she's done baking bread, she's never going to the lunatic asylum again, if he brings that child home drunk she'll go to Scotland and disappear from the face of the earth.\nPeter tells Mikey, Pay no attention to her, Cyclops. The mothers of Ireland are always enemies of the first pint. My own mother tried to kill my father with a frying pan when he took me for the first pint.\nMikey asks Peter if I can come with them and have a lemonade.\nPeter tells everyone in the pub that Mikey is there for his first pint and when all the men want to stand Mikey a pint Peter says, Ah, no, 'twould be a terrible thing if he had too much and turned against it entirely.\nThe pints are drawn and we sit against the wall, the Molloys with their pints and I with my lemonade. The men wish Mikey all the best in the life to come and wasn't it a gift from God that he fell off that spout years ago and never had the fit since and wasn't it a great pity about that poor little bugger, Quasimodo Dooley, carried off with the consumption after all his trouble talking for years like an Englishman so he could be on the BBC which is no fit place for an Irishman anyway.\nPeter is talking to the men and Mikey, sipping his first pint, whispers to me, I don't think I like it, but don't tell my father. Then he tells me how he practices the English accent in secret so that he can be a BBC announcer, Quasimodo's dream. He tells me I can have Cuchulain back, that he's no use to you when you're reading the news on the BBC. Now that he's sixteen he wants to go to England and if ever I get a wireless that will be him on the BBC Home Service.\nI tell him about the marriage certificate, how Billy Campbell said it has to be nine months but I was born in half the time and would he know if I was some class of a miracle.\nNaw, he says, naw. You're a bastard. You're doomed.\nYou don't have to be cursing me, Mikey.\nI'm not. That's what they call people who aren't born inside the\nnine months of the marriage, people conceived beyond the blanket. What's that?\nWhat's what?\nConceived.\nThat's when the sperm hits the egg and it grows and there you are\nnine months later.\nI don't know what you're talking about.\nHe whispers, The thing between your legs is the excitement. I don't\nlike the other names, the dong, the prick, the dick, the langer. So your father shoves his excitement into your mother and there's a spurt and these little germs go up into your mother where there's an egg and that grows into you.\nI'm not an egg.\nYou are an egg. Everyone was an egg once.\nWhy am I doomed? 'Tisn't my fault I'm a bastard.\nAll bastards are doomed. They're like babies that weren't baptized.\nThey're sent to Limbo for eternity and there's no way out and it's not their fault. It makes you wonder about God up there on His throne with no mercy for the little unbaptized babies. That's why I don't go near the chapel anymore. Anyway, you're doomed. Your father and mother had the excitement and they weren't married so you're not in a state of grace.\nWhat am I going to do?\nNothing. You're doomed.\nCan't I light a candle or something.\nYou could try the Blessed Virgin. She's in charge of the doom.\nBut I don't have a penny for the candle.\nAll right, all right, here's a penny. You can give it back when you\nget a job a million years from now. 'Tis costing me a fortune to be the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.\nThe barman is doing a crossword puzzle and he says to Peter, What's the opposite of advance?\nRetreat, says Peter.\nThat's it, says the barman. Everything has an opposite. Mother o' God, says Peter.\nWhat's up with you, Peter? says the barman.\nWhat was that you said before, Tommy?\nEverything has an opposite.\nMother o' God.\nAre you all right, Peter? Is the pint all right?\nThe pint is grand, Tommy, and I'm the champion of all pint\ndrinkers, amn't I?\nBegod an' you are, Peter. No denyin' that to you.\nThat means I could be the champion in the opposite department. What are you talking about, Peter?\nI could be the champion of no pints at all.\nAh, now, Peter, I think you're going a bit far. Is the wife all\nright at home?\nTommy, take this pint away from me. I'm the champion of no pints at\nall.\nPeter turns and takes the glass from Mikey. We're going home to\nyour mother, Mikey.\nYou didn't call me Cyclops, Dad.\nYou're Mikey. You're Michael. We're going to England. No more pints\nfor me, no pints for you, no more bread baking for your mother. Come on. We're leaving the pub and Tommy the barman calls after us, You know\nwhat 'tis, Peter. 'Tis all them bloody books you're reading. They have your head destroyed.\nPeter and Mikey turn to go home. I have to go to St. Joseph's to light the candle that will save me from the doom but I look in the window of Counihan's shop and there in the middle is a great slab of Cleeves' toffee and a sign, TWO PIECES FOR A PENNY. I know I'm doomed but the water is running along the sides of my tongue and when I put my penny on the counter for Miss Counihan I promise the Virgin Mary the next penny I get I'll be lighting a candle and would she please talk to her Son and delay the doom for awhile.\nA penn'orth of Cleeves' toffee doesn't last forever and when it's gone I have to think of going home to a mother who let my father push his\nexcitement into her so that I could be born in half the time and grow up to be a bastard. If she ever says a word about the red dress or anything I'll tell her I know all about the excitement and she'll be shocked.\nSaturday morning I meet The Red Hearts of Limerick and we wander out the road looking for a football challenge. The boys are still grousing that the bits of red dress don't look like hearts till Billy tells them if they don't want to play football go home and play with their sisters' dolls.\nThere are boys playing football in a field in Ballinacurra and Billy challenges them. They have eight players and we have only seven but we don't mind because one of them has one eye and Billy tells us stay on his blind side. Besides, he says, Frankie McCourt is nearly blind with his two bad eyes and that's worse. They're all togged out in blue and white jerseys and white shorts and proper football boots. One of them says we look like something the cat brought in and Malachy has to be held back from fighting them. We agree to play half an hour because the Ballinacurra boys say they have to go to lunch. Lunch. The whole world has dinner in the middle of the day but they have lunch. If no one scores in half an hour it's a draw. We play back and forth till Billy gets the ball and goes speeding and dancing up the sideline so fast no one can catch him and in goes the ball for a goal. The half hour is nearly up but the Ballinacurra boys want another half hour and they manage to score well into the second half hour. Then the ball goes over the line for touch. It's our ball. Billy stands on the touch line with the ball over his head. He pretends to look at Malachy but throws the ball to me. It comes to me as if it's the only thing that exists in the whole world. It comes straight to my foot and all I have to do is swivel to the left and swing that ball straight into the goal. There's a whiteness in my head and I feel like a boy in heaven. I'm floating over the whole field till The Red Hearts of Limerick clap me on the back and tell me that was a great goal, Frankie, you too, Billy.\nWe walk back along O'Connell Avenue and I keep thinking of the way the ball came to my foot and surely it was sent by God or the Blessed Virgin Mary who would never send such a blessing to one doomed for being born in half the time and I know as long as I live I'll never forget that ball coming from Billy Campbell, that goal.\nMam meets Bridey Hannon and her mother going up the lane and they tell her about Mr. Hannon's poor legs. Poor John, it's a trial for him to cycle home every night after delivering coal and turf all day on the great float for the coal merchants on the Dock Road. He's paid from eight in the morning till half five in the evening though he has to get the horse ready well before eight and settle him for the night well after half five. He's up and down on that float all day hoisting bags of coal and turf, desperate to keep the bandages in place on his legs so the dirt won't get into the open sores. The bandages are forever sticking and have to be ripped away and when he comes home she washes the sores with warm water and soap, covers them with ointment and wraps them in clean bandages. They can't afford new bandages every day so she keeps washing the old ones over and over till they're gray.\nMam says Mr. Hannon should see the doctor and Mrs. Hannon says, Sure, he seen the doctor a dozen times and the doctor says he has to stay off them legs. That's all. Stay off them legs. Sure how can he stay off them legs? He has to work. What would we live on if he didn't work?\nMam says maybe Bridey could get some kind of a job herself and Bridey is offended. Don't you know I have a weak chest, Angela? Don't you know I had rheumatic fever an' I could go at any time? I have to be careful.\nMam often talks about Bridey and her rheumatic fever and weak chest. She says, That one is able to sit here by the hour and complain about her ailments but it doesn't stop her from puffing away on the Woodbines.\nMam tells Bridey she's very sorry over the weak chest and it's terrible the way her father suffers. Mrs. Hannon tells my mother that John is getting worse every day, And what would you think, Mrs. McCourt, if your boy Frankie went on the float with him a few hours a week and helped him with the bags? We can barely afford it but Frankie could earn a shilling or two and John could rest his poor legs.\nMam says, I don't know, he's only eleven and he had that typhoid and the coal dust wouldn't be good for his eyes.\nBridey says, He'd be out in the air and there's nothing like fresh air for someone with bad eyes or getting over the typhoid, isn't that right, Frankie?\n'Tis, Bridey.\nI'm dying to go around with Mr. Hannon on the great float like a real workingman. If I'm good at it they might let me stay at home from school forever but Mam says, He can do it as long as it doesn't interfere with school and he can start on a Saturday morning.\nI'm a man now so I light the fire early on Saturday morning and make my own tea and fried bread. I wait next door for Mr. Hannon to come out with his bicycle and there's a lovely smell of rashers and eggs coming through the window. Mam says Mr. Hannon gets the best of food because Mrs. Hannon is as mad about him as she was the day she married him. They're like two lovers out of an American film the way they go on. Here he is pushing the bicycle and puffing away on the pipe in his mouth. He tells me climb up on the bar of his bike and off we go to my first job as a man. His head is over mine on the bike and the smell of the pipe is lovely. There's a coal smell on his clothes and that makes me sneeze.\nMen are walking or cycling toward the coal yards and Rank's Flour Mills and the Limerick Steamship Company on the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon takes his pipe from his mouth and tells me this is the best morning of all, Saturday, half day. We'll start at eight and be finished by the time the Angelus rings at twelve.\nFirst we get the horse ready, give him a bit of a rub, fill the wooden tub with oats and the bucket with water. Mr. Hannon shows me how to put on the harness and lets me back the horse into the shafts of the float. He says, Jaysus, Frankie, you have the knack of it.\nThat makes me so happy I want to jump up and down and drive a float the rest of my life.\nThere are two men filling bags with coal and turf and weighing them on the great iron scale, a hundredweight in each bag. It's their job to stack the bags on the float while Mr. Hannon goes to the office for the delivery dockets. The bag men are fast and we're ready for our rounds. Mr. Hannon sits up on the left side of the float and flicks the whip to show where I'm to sit on the right side. It's hard to climb up the way the float is so high and packed with bags and I try to get up by climbing the wheel. Mr. Hannon says I should never do the likes of that again. Never put your leg or hand near a wheel when the horse is harnessed in\nthe shafts. A horse might take a notion to go for a walk for himself and there you are with the leg or the arm caught in the wheel and twisted off your body and you looking at it. He says to the horse, G'up ower that, and the horse shakes his head and rattles the harness and Mr. Hannon laughs. That fool of a horse loves to work, he says. He won't be rattling his harness in a few hours.\nWhen the rain starts we cover ourselves with old coal bags and Mr. Hannon turns his pipe upside down in his mouth to keep the tobacco dry. He says the rain makes everything heavier but what's the use of complaining. You might as well complain about the sun in Africa.\nWe cross the Sarsfield Bridge for deliveries to the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road. Rich people, says Mr. Hannon, and very slow to put their hands in their pockets for a tip.\nWe have sixteen bags to deliver. Mr. Hannon says we're lucky today because some houses get more than one and he doesn't have to be climbing on and off that float destroying his legs. When we stop he gets down and I pull the bag to the edge and lay it on his shoulders. Some houses have areas outside where you pull up a trap door and tip the bag till it empties and that's easy. There are other houses with long backyards and you can see Mr. Hannon suffering with his legs when he has to carry the bags from the float to the sheds near the back doors. Ah, Jaysus, Frankie, ah, Jaysus, is the only complaint out of him and he asks me to give him a hand to climb back on the float. He says if he had a handcart he could wheel the bags from float to house and that would be a blessing but a handcart would cost two weeks' wages and who could afford that?\nThe bags are delivered and the sun is out, the float is empty, and the horse knows his workday is over. It's lovely to sit on the float looking along the length of the horse from his tail to his head rocking along the Ennis Road over the Shannon and up the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon says the man who delivered sixteen hundredweights of coal and turf deserves a pint and the boy who helped him deserves a lemonade. He tells me I should go to school and not be like him working away with the two legs rotting under him. Go to school, Frankie, and get out of Limerick and Ireland itself. This war will be over some day and you can go to America or Australia or any big open country where you can look up and see no end to the land. The world is wide and you can have great adventures. If I didn't have these two legs I'd be over in England making a fortune in the factories like the rest of the Irishmen, like your father. No, not like your father. I hear he left you high and dry, eh? I don't know how a man in his right mind can go off and leave a wife and family to starve and shiver in a Limerick winter. School, Frankie, school. The books, the books, the books. Get out of Limerick before your legs rot and your mind collapses entirely.\nThe horse clops along and when we get to the coal yard we feed and water him and give him a rubdown. Mr. Hannon talks to him all the time and calls him Me oul' segosha, and the horse snuffles and pushes his nose against Mr. Hannon's chest. I'd love to bring this horse home and let him stay downstairs when we're up in Italy but even if I could get him in the door my mother would yell at me that the last thing we need in this house is a horse.\nThe streets going up from the Dock Road are too hilly for Mr. Hannon to ride the bicycle and carry me, so we walk. His legs are sore from the day and it takes a long time to get up to Henry Street. He leans\non the bicycle or sits on the steps outside houses, grinding down on the pipe in his mouth.\nI'm wondering when I'll get the money for the day's work because Mam might let me go to the Lyric Cinema if I get home in time with my shilling or whatever Mr. Hannon gives me. Now we're at the door of South's pub and he tells me come in, didn't he promise me a lemonade?\nUncle Pa Keating is sitting in the pub. He's all black as usual and he's sitting next to Bill Galvin, all white as usual, snuffling and taking great slugs out of his black pint. Mr. Hannon says, How're you? and sits on the other side of Bill Galvin and everyone in the pub laughs. Jaysus, says the barman, look at that, two lumps of coal and a snowball. Men come in from other parts of the pub to see the two coal black men with the lime white man in the middle and they want to send down to the Limerick Leader for a man with a camera.\nUncle Pa says, What are you doing all black yourself, Frankie? Did you fall down a coal mine?\nI was helping Mr. Hannon on the float.\nYour eyes look atrocious, Frankie. Piss holes in the snow. 'Tis the coal dust, Uncle Pa.\nWash them when you go home.\nI will, Uncle Pa.\nMr. Hannon buys me a lemonade, gives me the shilling for my\nmorning's work and tells me I can go home now, I'm a great worker and I can help him again next week after school.\nOn the way home I see myself in the glass of a shop window all black from the coal, and I feel like a man, a man with a shilling in his pocket, a man who had a lemonade in a pub with two coal men and a lime man. I'm not a child anymore and I could easily leave Leamy's School forever. I could work with Mr. Hannon every day and when his legs got too bad I could take over the float and deliver coal to the rich people the rest of my life and my mother wouldn't have to be a beggar at the Redemptorist priests' house.\nPeople on the streets and lanes give me curious looks. Boys and girls laugh and call out, Here's the chimney sweep. How much do you want for cleaning our chimney? Did you fall into a coal hole? Were you burned by the darkness?\nThey're ignorant. They don't know I spent the day delivering hundredweights of coal and turf. They don't know I'm a man.\nMam is sleeping up in Italy with Alphie and there's a coat over the window to keep the room dark. I tell her I earned a shilling and she says I can go to the Lyric, I deserve it. Take tuppence and leave the rest of the shilling on the mantelpiece downstairs so that she can send out for a loaf of bread for the tea. The coat suddenly drops from the window and the room is bright. Mam looks at me, God above, look at your eyes. Go downstairs and I'll be down in a minute to wash them.\nShe heats water in the kettle and dabs at my eyes with boric acid powder and tells me I can't go to the Lyric Cinema today or any day till my eyes clear up though God knows when that will be. She says, You can't be delivering coal with the state of your eyes. The dust will surely destroy them.\nI want the job. I want to bring home the shilling. I want to be a man.\nYou can be a man without bringing home a shilling. Go upstairs and lie down and rest your two eyes or it's a blind man you'll be.\nI want that job. I wash my eyes three times a day with the boric acid powder. I remember Seamus in the hospital and how his uncle's eyes were cured with the blink exercise and I make sure to sit and blink for an hour every day. You can't beat the blink for the strong eye, he said. And now I blink and blink till Malachy runs to my mother, talking out in the lane with Mrs. Hannon, Mam, something is up with Frankie, he's upstairs blinking and blinking.\nShe comes running up. What's wrong with you? I'm making my eyes strong with the exercise. What exercise?\nThe blinking.\nBlinking is not exercise.\nSeamus in the hospital says you can't beat the blink for the strong eye. His uncle had powerful eyes from the blinking. She says I'm getting odd and goes back to the lane and her chat with Mrs. Hannon and I blink and bathe my eyes with the boric acid powder in warm water. I can hear Mrs. Hannon through the window, Your little Frankie is a godsend to John for 'tis the climbing up and down on that float that was ruining his legs entirely.\nMam doesn't say anything and that means she feels so sorry for Mr. Hannon she'll let me help him again on his heavy delivery day, Thursday. I wash my eyes three times a day and I blink till I get a pain in my eyebrows. I blink in school when the master isn't looking and all the boys in my class are calling me Blinky and adding that to the list of names.\nBlinky McCourt beggar woman's son scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing\nJap.\nI don't care what they call me anymore as long as my eyes are\nclearing up and I have a regular job lifting hundredweights of coal on a float. I wish they could see me on Thursday after school when I'm on the float and Mr. Hannon hands me the reins so that he can smoke his pipe in comfort. Here you are, Frankie, nice and gentle for this is a good horse and he doesn't need to be pulled at.\nHe hands me the whip too but you never need the whip with this horse. It's all for show and I just flick it at the air like Mr. Hannon or I might knock a fly off the horse's great golden rump swinging between the shafts.\nSurely the world is looking at me and admiring the way I rock with the float, the cool way I have with the reins and the whip. I wish I had a pipe like Mr. Hannon and a tweed cap. I wish I could be a real coal man with black skin like Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa Keating so that people would say, There goes Frankie McCourt that delivers all the coal in Limerick and drinks his pint in South's pub. I'd never wash my face. I'd be black every day of the year even Christmas when you're supposed to give yourself a good wash for the coming of the Infant Jesus. I know He wouldn't mind because I saw the Three Wise Men in the Christmas crib at the Redemptorist church and one of them was blacker than Uncle Pa Keating, the blackest man in Limerick, and if a Wise Man is black it means that everywhere you go in the world someone is delivering coal.\nThe horse lifts his tail and great lumps of steaming yellow shit drop from his behind. I start to pull on the reins so that he can stop and have a bit of comfort for himself but Mr. Hannon says, No, Frankie, let him trot. They always shit on the trot. That's one of the blessings horses have, they shit on the trot, and they're not dirty and stinking\nlike the human race, not at all, Frankie. The worst thing in the world is to go into a lavatory after a man that had a feed of pig's feet and a night of pints. The stink from that could twist the nostrils of a strong man. Horses are different. All they have is oats and hay and what they drop is clean and natural.\nI work with Mr. Hannon after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the half day on Saturday morning and that means three shillings for my mother though she worries all the time over my eyes. The minute I get home she washes them and makes me rest them for half an hour.\nMr. Hannon says he'll wait near Leamy's School for me on Thursdays after his deliveries on Barrington Street. Now the boys will see me. Now they'll know I'm a workingman and more than a scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing Jap. Mr. Hannon says, Up you get, and I climb up on the float like any workingman. I look at the boys gawking at me. Gawking. I tell Mr. Hannon if he wants to smoke his pipe in comfort I'll take the reins and when he hands them over I'm sure I hear the boys gasping. I tell the horse, G'up ower that, like Mr. Hannon. We trot away and I know dozens of Leamy's boys are committing the deadly sin of envy. I tell the horse again, G'up ower that, to make sure everyone heard, to make sure they know I'm driving that float and no one else, to make sure they'll never forget it was me they saw on that float with the reins and the whip. It's the best day of my life, better than my First Communion day, which Grandma ruined, better than my Confirmation day when I had the typhoid.\nThey don't call me names anymore. They don't laugh at my scabby eyes. They want to know how I got such a good job at eleven years of age and what I'm paid and if I'll have that job forever. They want to know if there are any other good jobs going in the coal yards and would I put in a good word for them.\nThen there are big boys of thirteen who stick their faces in mine and say they should have that job because they're bigger and I'm nothing but a scrawny little runt with no shoulders. They can talk as much as they like. I have the job and Mr. Hannon tells me I'm powerful.\nThere are days his legs are so bad he can hardly walk at all and you can see Mrs. Hannon worries. She gives me a mug of tea and I watch her roll up his trouser legs and peel away the dirty bandages. The sores are red and yellow and clogged with coal dust. She washes them with soapy water and smears them with a yellow ointment. She props the legs up on a chair and that's where he stays the rest of the night reading the paper or a book from the shelf above his head.\nThe legs are getting so bad he has to get up an hour earlier in the morning to get the stiffness out, to put on another dressing. It's still dark one Saturday morning when Mrs. Hannon knocks at our door and asks me if I'd go to a neighbor and borrow their handcart to take on the float for Mr. Hannon will never be able to carry the bags today and maybe I'd just roll them on the handcart for him. He won't be able to carry me on his bicycle so I can meet him at the yard with the handcart.\nThe neighbor says, Anything for Mr. Hannon, God bless him.\nI wait at the gate of the coal yard and watch him cycle toward me, slower than ever. He's so stiff he can hardly get off the bike and he says, You're a great man, Frankie. He lets me get the horse ready though I still have trouble getting on the harness. He lets me handle the float out of the yard and into the frosty streets and I wish I could drive forever and never go home. Mr. Hannon shows me how to pull the bags to the edge of the float and drop them on the ground so that I can pull them\non to the handcart and push them to the houses. He tells me how to lift and push the bags without straining myself and we have the sixteen bags delivered by noon.\nI wish the boys at Leamy's could see me now, the way I drive the horse and handle the bags, the way I do everything while Mr. Hannon rests his legs. I wish they could see me pushing the handcart to South's pub and having my lemonade with Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa and me all black and Bill Galvin all white. I'd like to show the world the tips Mr. Hannon lets me keep, four shillings, and the shilling he gives me for the morning's work, five shillings altogether.\nMam is sitting by the fire and when I hand her the money she looks at me, drops it in her lap and cries. I'm puzzled because money is supposed to make you happy. Look at your eyes, she says. Go to that glass and look at your eyes.\nMy face is black and the eyes are worse than ever. The whites and the eyelids are red, and the yellow stuff oozes to the corners and out over the lower lids. If the ooze sits a while it forms a crust that has to be picked off or washed away.\nMam says that's the end of it. No more Mr. Hannon. I try to explain that Mr. Hannon needs me. He can barely walk anymore. I had to do everything this morning, drive the float, wheel the handcart with the bags, sit in the pub, drink lemonade, listen to the men discussing who is the best, Rommel or Montgomery.\nShe says she's sorry for Mr. Hannon's troubles but we have troubles of our own and the last thing she needs now is a blind son stumbling through the streets of Limerick. Bad enough you nearly died of typhoid, now you want to go blind on top of it.\nAnd I can't stop crying now because this was my one chance to be a man and bring home the money the telegram boy never brought from my father. I can't stop crying because I don't know what Mr. Hannon is going to do on Monday morning when he has no one to help him pull the bags to the edge of the float, to push the bags into the houses. I can't stop crying because of the way he is with that horse he calls sweet because he's so gentle himself and what will the horse do if Mr. Hannon isn't there to take him out, if I'm not there to take him out? Will that horse fall down hungry for the want of oats and hay and the odd apple?\nMam says I shouldn't be crying, it's bad for the eyes. She says, We'll see. That's all I can tell you now. We'll see.\nShe washes my eyes and gives me sixpence to take Malachy to the Lyric to see Boris Karloff in The Man They Could Not Hang and have two pieces of Cleeves' toffee. It's hard to see the screen with the yellow stuff oozing from my eyes and Malachy has to tell me what's happening. People around us tell him shut up, they'd like to hear what Boris Karloff is saying, and when Malachy talks back to them and tells them he's only helping his blind brother they call the man in charge, Frank Goggin, and he says if he hears another word out of Malachy he'll throw the two of us out.\nI don't mind. I have a way of squeezing the stuff out of one eye and clearing it so that I can see the screen while the other eye fills up and I go back and forth, squeeze, look, squeeze, look, and everything I see is yellow.\nMonday morning Mrs. Hannon is knocking on our door again. She asks Mam if Frank would ever go down to the coal yard and tell the man in the office that Mr. Hannon can't come in today, that he has to see a doctor\nabout his legs, that he'll surely be in tomorrow and what he can't deliver today he will tomorrow. Mrs. Hannon always calls me Frank now. Anyone that delivers hundredweights of coal is not a Frankie.\nThe man in the office says, Humph. I think we're very tolerant with Hannon. You, what's your name?\nMcCourt, sir.\nTell Hannon we'll need a note from the doctor. Do you understand\nthat?\nI do, sir.\nThe doctor tells Mr. Hannon he has to go to the hospital or it's a case of gangrene he'll have and the doctor won't be responsible. The ambulance takes Mr. Hannon away and my big job is gone. Now I'll be white like everyone else in Leamy's, no float, no horse, no shillings to bring home to my mother.\nIn a few days Bridey Hannon comes to our door. She says her mother would like me to come and see her, have a cup of tea with her. Mrs. Hannon is sitting by the fire with her hand on the seat of Mr. Hannon's chair. Sit down, Frank, she says, and when I go to sit on one of the ordinary kitchen chairs she says, No, sit here. Sit here on the chair of himself. Do you know how old he is, Frank?\nOh, he must be very old, Mrs. Hannon. He must be thirty-five.\nShe smiles. She has lovely teeth. He's forty-nine, Frank, and a man that age shouldn't have legs like that.\nHe shouldn't, Mrs. Hannon.\nDid you know you were a joy to him going around on that float?\nI didn't, Mrs. Hannon.\nYou were. We had two daughters, Bridey that you know, and Kathleen,\nthe nurse above in Dublin. But no son and he said you gave him the feeling of a son.\nI feel my eyes burning and I don't want her to see me crying especially when I don't know why I'm crying. That's all I do lately. Is it the job? Is it Mr. Hannon? My mother says, Oh, your bladder is near your eye.\nI think I'm crying because of the quiet way Mrs. Hannon is talking and she's talking like that because of Mr. Hannon.\nLike a son, she says, and I'm glad he had that feeling. His working days are over, you know. He has to stay at home from this out. There might be a cure and if there is sure he might be able to get a job as a watchman where he doesn't have to be lifting and hauling.\nI won't have a job anymore, Mrs. Hannon.\nYou have a job, Frank. School. That's your job.\nThat's not a job, Mrs. Hannon.\nYou'll never have another job like it, Frank. It breaks Mr.\nHannon's heart to think of you dragging bags of coal off a float and it breaks your mother's heart and 'twill destroy your eyes. God knows I'm sorry I ever got you into this for it had your poor mother caught between your eyes and Mr. Hannon's legs.\nCan I go to the hospital to see Mr. Hannon?\nThey might not let you in but surely you can come here to see him. God knows he won't be doing much but reading and looking out the window.\nMam tells me at home, You shouldn't cry but then again tears are salty and they'll wash the bad stuff from your eyes.\nXII\nThere's a letter from Dad. He's coming home two days before Christmas. He says everything will be different, he's a new man, he hopes we're good boys, obeying our mother, attending to our religious duties, and he's bringing us all something for Christmas.\nMam takes me to the railway station to meet him. The station is always exciting with all the coming and going, people leaning from carriages, crying, smiling, waving good-bye, the train hooting and calling, chugging away in clouds of steam, people sniffling on the platform, the railway tracks silvering into the distance, on to Dublin and the world beyond.\nNow it's near midnight and cold on the empty platform. A man in a railway cap asks us if we'd like to wait in a warm place. Mam says, Thank you very much, and laughs when he leads us to the end of the platform where we have to climb a ladder to the signal tower. It takes her a while because she's heavy and she keeps saying, Oh, God, oh, God.\nWe're above the world and it's dark in the signal tower except for the lights that blink red and green and yellow when the man bends over the board. He says, I'm just having a bit of supper and you're welcome.\nMam says, Ah, no, thanks, we couldn't take your supper from you.\nHe says, The wife always makes too much for me and if I was up in this tower for a week I wouldn't be able to eat it. Sure it's not hard work looking at lights and pulling on the odd lever.\nHe takes the top off a flask and pours cocoa into a mug. Here, he says to me, put yourself outside that cocoa.\nHe hands Mam half a sandwich. Ah, no, she says, surely you could take that home to your children.\nI have two sons, missus, and they're off there fighting in the forces of His Majesty, the King of England. One did his bit with Montgomery in Africa and the other is over in Burma or some other bloody place, excuse the language. We get our freedom from England and then we fight her wars. So here, missus, take the bit of sandwich.\nLights on the board are clicking and the man says, Your train is coming, missus.\nThank you very much and Happy Christmas.\nHappy Christmas to yourself, missus, and a Happy New Year, too. Mind yourself on that ladder, young fella. Help your mother.\nThank you very much, sir.\nWe wait again on the platform while the train rumbles into the station. Carriage doors open and a few men with suitcases step to the platform and hurry toward the gate. There is a clanking of milk cans dropped to the platform. A man and two boys are unloading newspapers and magazines.\nThere is no sign of my father. Mam says he might be asleep in one of the carriages but we know he hardly sleeps even in his own bed. She says the boat from Holyhead might have been late and that would make him miss the train. The Irish Sea is desperate at this time of the year.\nHe's not coming, Mam. He doesn't care about us. He's just drunk over there in England.\nDon't talk about your father like that.\nI say no more to her. I don't tell her I wish I had a father like the man in the signal tower who gives you sandwiches and cocoa.\nNext day Dad walks in the door. His top teeth are missing and there's a bruise under his left eye. He says the Irish Sea was rough and when he leaned over the side his teeth dropped out. Mam says, It wouldn't be the drink, would it? It wouldn't be a fight?\nOch, no, Angela.\nMichael says, You said you'd have something for us, Dad.\nOh, I do.\nHe takes a box of chocolates from his suitcase and hands it to Mam.\nShe opens the box and shows us the inside where half the chocolates are\ngone.\nCould you spare it? she says.\nShe shuts the box and puts it on the mantelpiece. We'll have\nchocolates after our Christmas dinner tomorrow.\nMam asks him if he brought any money. He tells her times are hard,\njobs are scarce, and she says, Is it coddin' me you are? There's a war on and there's nothing but jobs in England. You drank the money, didn't you?\nYou drank the money, Dad.\nYou drank the money, Dad.\nYou drank the money, Dad.\nWe're shouting so loud Alphie begins to cry. Dad says, Och, boys,\nnow boys. Respect for your father.\nHe puts on his cap. He has to see a man. Mam says, Go see your man\nbut don't come drunk to this house tonight singing Roddy McCorley or anything else.\nHe comes home drunk but he's quiet and passes out on the floor next to Mam's bed.\nWe have a Christmas dinner next day because of the food voucher Mam got from the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We have sheep's head, cabbage, floury white potatoes, and a bottle of cider because it's Christmas.\nDad says he's not hungry, he'll have tea, borrows a cigarette from Mam. She says, Eat something. It's Christmas.\nHe tells her again he's not hungry but if no one else wants them he'll eat the sheep's eyes. He says there's great nourishment in the eye and we all make sounds of disgust. He washes them down with his tea and smokes the rest of his Woodbine. He puts on his cap and goes upstairs for his suitcase.\nMam says, Where are you going?\nLondon.\nOn this day of Our Lord? Christmas Day?\nIt's the best day for travel. People in motor cars will always give\nthe workingman a lift to Dublin. They think of the hard times of the Holy Family.\nAnd how will you get on the boat to Holyhead without a penny in your pocket?\nThe way I came. There's always a time when they're not looking.\nHe kisses each of us on the forehead, tells us be good boys, obey Mam, say our prayers. He tells Mam he'll write and she says, Oh, yes, the way you always did. He stands before her with his suitcase. She gets up, takes down the box of chocolates and hands them around. She puts a chocolate in her mouth and takes it out again because it's too hard and she can't chew it. I have a soft one and I offer it for the hard one, which will last longer. It's creamy and rich and there's a nut in the middle. Malachy and Michael complain they didn't get a nut and why is it\nFrank always gets the nut? Mam says, What do you mean, always? This is the first time we ever had a box of chocolates.\nMalachy says, He got the raisin in the bun at school and all the boys said he gave it to Paddy Clohessy, so why couldn't he give us the nut?\nMam says, Because 'tis Christmas and he has sore eyes and the nut is good for the sore eyes.\nMichael says, Will the nut make his eyes better?\n'Twill.\nWill it make one eye better or will it make two eyes better?\nThe two eyes, I think.\nMalachy says, If I had another nut I'd give it to him for his eyes. Mam says, I know you would.\nDad watches us a moment eating our chocolates. He lifts the latch,\ngoes out the door and pulls it shut.\nMam tells Bridey Hannon, Days are bad but nights are worse and will\nthis rain ever stop? She tries to ease the bad days by staying in bed and letting Malachy and me light the fire in the morning while she sits up in the bed passing Alphie bits of bread and holding the mug to his mouth for the tea that's in it. We have to go downstairs to Ireland to wash our faces in the basin under the tap and try to dry ourselves in the old damp shirt that hangs over the back of a chair. She makes us stand by the bed to see if we left rings of dirt around our necks and if we did it's back down to the tap and the damp shirt. When there's a hole in a pair of pants she sits up and patches it with any rag she can find. We wear short pants till we're thirteen or fourteen and our long stockings always have holes to be darned. If she has no wool for the darning and the stockings are dark we can blacken our ankles with shoe polish for the respectability that's in it. It's a terrible thing to walk the world with skin showing through the holes of our stockings. When we wear them week after week the holes grow so big we have to pull the stocking forward under the toes so that the hole in the back is hidden in the shoe. On rainy days the stockings are soggy and we have to hang them before the fire at night and hope they'll dry by morning. Then they're hard with dirt cake and we're afraid to pull them on our feet for fear they'll fall on the floor in bits before our eyes. We might be lucky enough to get our stockings on but then we have to block the holes in our shoes and I fight with my brother, Malachy, over any scrap of cardboard or paper in the house. Michael is only six and he has to wait for anything left over unless Mam threatens us from the bed that we're to help our small brother. She says, If ye don't fix yeer brother's shoes an' I have to get out of this bed there will be wigs on the green. You'd have to feel sorry for Michael because he's too old to play with Alphie and too young to play with us and he can't fight with anyone for the same reasons.\nThe rest of the dressing is easy, the shirt I wore to bed is the shirt I wear to school. I wear it day in day out. It's the shirt for football, for climbing walls, for robbings orchards. I go to Mass and the Confraternity in that shirt and people sniff the air and move away. If Mam gets a docket for a new one at the St. Vincent de Paul the old shirt is promoted to towel and hangs damp on the chair for months or Mam might use bits of it to patch other shirts. She might even cut it up and let Alphie wear it a while before it winds up on the floor pushed against the bottom of the door to block the rain from the lane.\nWe go to school through lanes and back streets so that we won't meet the respectable boys who go to the Christian Brothers'School or the rich ones who go to the Jesuit school, Crescent College. The Christian Brothers' boys wear tweed jackets, warm woolen sweaters, shirts, ties and shiny new boots. We know they're the ones who will get jobs in the civil service and help the people who run the world. The Crescent College boys wear blazers and school scarves tossed around their necks and over their shoulders to show they're cock o' the walk. They have long hair which falls across their foreheads and over their eyes so that they can toss their quiffs like Englishmen. We know they're the ones who will go to university, take over the family business, run the government, run the world. We'll be the messenger boys on bicycles who deliver their groceries or we'll go to England to work on the building sites. Our sisters will mind their children and scrub their floors unless they go off to England, too. We know that. We're ashamed of the way we look and if boys from the rich schools pass remarks we'll get into a fight and wind up with bloody noses or torn clothes. Our masters will have no patience with us and our fights because their sons go to the rich schools and, Ye have no right to raise your hands to a better class of people so ye don't.\nYou never know when you might come home and find Mam sitting by the fire chatting with a woman and a child, strangers. Always a woman and child. Mam finds them wandering the streets and if they ask, Could you spare a few pennies, miss? her heart breaks. She never has money so she invites them home for tea and a bit of fried bread and if it's a bad night she'll let them sleep by the fire on a pile of rags in the corner. The bread she gives them always means less for us and if we complain she says there are always people worse off and we can surely spare a little from what we have.\nMichael is just as bad. He brings home stray dogs and old men. You never know when you'll find a dog in the bed with him. There are dogs with sores, dogs with no ears, no tails. There's a blind greyhound he found in the park tormented by children. Michael fought off the children, picked up the greyhound that was bigger than himself and told Mam the dog could have his supper. Mam says, What supper? We're lucky if there's a cut of bread in the house. Michael tells her the dog can have his bread. Mam says that dog has to go tomorrow and Michael cries all night and cries worse in the morning when he finds the dog dead in the bed beside him. He won't go to school because he has to dig a grave outside where the stable was and he wants all of us to dig with him and say the rosary. Malachy says it's useless saying prayers for a dog, how do you know he was even a Catholic? Michael says, Of course he was a Catholic dog. Didn't I have him in my arms? He cries so hard over the dog Mam lets us all stay at home from school. We're so delighted we don't mind helping Michael with the grave and we say three Hail Marys. We're not going to stand there wasting a good day off from school saying the rosary for a dead greyhound. Michael is only six but when he brings old men home he manages to get the fire going and give them tea. Mam says it's driving her crazy to come home and find these old men drinking out of her favorite mug and mumbling and scratching by the fire. She tells Bridey Hannon that Michael has a habit of bringing home old men all a bit gone in the head and if he doesn't have a bit of bread for them he knocks on neighbors' doors and has no shame begging for it. In the end she tells\nMichael, No more old men. One of them left us with lice and we're plagued.\nThe lice are disgusting, worse than rats. They're in our heads and ears and they sit in the hollows of our collarbones. They dig into our skin. They get into the seams of our clothes and they're everywhere in the coats we use as blankets. We have to search every inch of Alphie's body because he's a baby and helpless.\nThe lice are worse than the fleas. Lice squat and suck and we can see our blood through their skins. Fleas jump and bite and they're clean and we prefer them. Things that jump are cleaner than things that squat.\nWe all agree there will be no more stray women and children, dogs and old men. We don't want any more diseases and infections.\nMichael cries.\nGrandma's next-door neighbor, Mrs. Purcell, has the only wireless in her lane. The government gave it to her because she's old and blind. I want a radio. My grandmother is old but she's not blind and what's the use of having a grandmother who won't go blind and get a government radio?\nSunday nights I sit outside on the pavement under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to plays on the BBC and Radio Eireann, the Irish station. You can hear plays by O'Casey, Shaw, Ibsen and Shakespeare himself, the best of all, even if he is English. Shakespeare is like mashed potatoes, you can never get enough of him. And you can hear strange plays about Greeks plucking out their eyes because they married their mothers by mistake.\nOne night I'm sitting under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to Macbeth. Her daughter, Kathleen, sticks her head out the door. Come in, Frankie. My mother says you'll catch the consumption sitting on the ground in this weather.\nAh, no, Kathleen. It's all right.\nNo. Come in.\nThey give me tea and a grand cut of bread slathered with blackberry\njam. Mrs. Purcell says, Do you like the Shakespeare, Frankie?\nI love the Shakespeare, Mrs. Purcell.\nOh, he's music, Frankie, and he has the best stories in the world.\nI don't know what I'd do with meself of a Sunday night if I didn't have the Shakespeare.\nWhen the play finishes she lets me fiddle with the knob on the radio and I roam the dial for distant sounds on the shortwave band, strange whispering and hissing, the whoosh of the ocean coming and going and the Morse Code dit dit dit dot. I hear mandolins, guitars, Spanish bagpipes, the drums of Africa, boatmen wailing on the Nile. I see sailors on watch sipping mugs of hot cocoa. I see cathedrals, skyscrapers, cottages. I see Bedouins in the Sahara and the French Foreign Legion, cowboys on the American prairie. I see goats skipping along the rocky coast of Greece where the shepherds are blind because they married their mothers by mistake. I see people chatting in caf\u00e9s, sipping wine, strolling on boulevards and avenues. I see night women in doorways, monks chanting vespers, and here is the great boom of Big Ben, This is the BBC Overseas Service and here is the news.\nMrs. Purcell says, Leave that on, Frankie, so we'll know the state of the world.\nAfter the news there is the American Armed Forces Network and it's lovely to hear the American voices easy and cool and here is the music,\noh, man, the music of Duke Ellington himself telling me take the A train to where Billie Holiday sings only to me, I can't give you anything but love, baby.\nThat's the only thing I've plenty of, baby.\nOh, Billie, Billie, I want to be in America with you and all that music, where no one has bad teeth, people leave food on their plates, every family has a lavatory, and everyone lives happily ever after.\nAnd Mrs. Purcell says, Do you know what, Frankie?\nWhat, Mrs. Purcell?\nThat Shakespeare is that good he must have been an Irishman. The rent man is losing his patience. He tells Mam, Four weeks\nbehind you are, missus. That's one pound two shillings. This has to stop for I have to go back to the office and report to Sir Vincent Nash that the McCourts are a month behind. Where am I then, missus? Out on my arse jobless and a mother to support that's ninety-two and a daily communicant in the Franciscan church. The rent man collects the rents, missus, or he loses the job. I'll be back next week and if you don't have the money, one pound eight shillings and sixpence total, 'tis out on the pavement you'll be with the skies dripping on your furniture.\nMam comes back up to Italy and sits by the fire wondering where in God's name she'll get the money for a week's rent never mind the arrears. She'd love a cup of tea but there's no way of boiling the water till Malachy pulls a loose board off the wall between the two upstairs rooms. Mam says, Well, 'tis off now and we might as well chop it up for the fire. We boil the water and use the rest of the wood for the morning tea but what about tonight and tomorrow and ever after? Mam says, One more board from that wall, one more and not another one. She says that for two weeks till there's nothing left but the beam frame. She warns us we are not to touch the beams for they hold up the ceiling and the house itself.\nOh, we'd never touch the beams.\nShe goes to see Grandma and it's so cold in the house I take the hatchet to one of the beams. Malachy cheers me on and Michael claps his hands with excitement. I pull on the beam, the ceiling groans and down on Mam's bed there's a shower of plaster, slates, rain. Malachy says, Oh, God, we'll all be killed, and Michael dances around singing, Frankie broke the house, Frankie broke the house.\nWe run through the rain to tell Mam the news. She looks puzzled with Michael chanting, Frankie broke the house, till I explain there's a hole in the house and it's falling down. She says, Jesus, and runs through the streets with Grandma trying to keep up.\nMam sees her bed buried under plaster and slates and pulls at her hair, What'll we do at all, at all? and screams at me for interfering with the beams. Grandma says, I'll go to the landlord's office and tell them fix this before ye are all drowned entirely.\nShe's back in no time with the rent man. He says, Great God in heaven, where's the other room?\nGrandma says, What room?\nI rented ye two rooms up here and one is gone. Where is that room? Mam says, What room?\nThere were two rooms up here and now there's one. And what happened\nto the wall? There was a wall. Now there's no wall. I distinctly remember a wall because I distinctly remember a room. Now where is that wall? Where is that room?\nGrandma says, I don't remember a wall and if I don't remember a wall how can I remember a room?\nYe don't remember? Well, I remember. Forty years a landlord's agent and I never seen the likes of this. By God, 'tis a desperate situation altogether when you can't turn your back but tenants are not paying their rent and making walls and rooms disappear on top of it. I want to know where that wall is and what ye did with the room, so I do.\nMam turns to us. Do any of ye remember a wall?\nMichael pulls at her hand. Is that the wall we burned in the fire? The rent man says, Dear God in heaven, this beats Banagher, this\ntakes the bloody biscuit, this is goin' beyond the beyonds. No rent and what am I to tell Sir Vincent below in the office? Out, missus, I'm puttin' ye out. One week from today I'll knock on this door and I want to find nobody at home, everybody out never to return. Do you have me, missus?\nMam's face is tight. 'Tis a pity you weren't alive in the times when the English were evicting us and leaving us on the side of the road.\nNo lip, missus, or I'll send the men to put ye out tomorrow.\nHe goes out the door and leaves it open to show what he thinks of us. Mam says, I don't know in God's name what I'm going to do. Grandma says, Well, I don't have room for ye but your cousin, Gerard Griffin, is living out the Rosbrien Road in that little house of his mother's and he'd surely be able to take ye in till better times come. 'Tis all hours of the night but I'll go up and see what he says and Frank can come with me.\nShe tells me put on a coat but I don't have one and she says, I suppose there's no use in asking if ye have an umbrella either. Come on.\nShe pulls the shawl over her head and I follow her out the door, up the lane, through the rain to Rosbrien Road nearly two miles away. She knocks on the door of a little cottage in a long row of little cottages. Are you there, Laman? I know you're in there. Open the door.\nGrandma, why are you calling him Laman? Isn't his name Gerard?\nHow would I know? Do I know why the world calls your uncle Pat Ab? Everyone calls this fella Laman. Open the door. We'll go in. He might be working overtime.\nShe pushes the door. It's dark and there's a damp sweet smell in the room. This room looks like the kitchen and there's a smaller room next to it. There's a little loft above the bedroom with a skylight where the rain is beating. There are boxes everywhere, newspapers, magazines, bits of food, mugs, empty tins. We can see two beds taking up all the space in the bedroom, a great acre of a bed and a smaller one near the window. Grandma pokes at a lump in the big bed. Laman, is that you? Get up, will you, get up.\nWhat? What? What? What?\nThere's trouble. Angela is gettin' evicted with the children an' 'tis delvin'out of the heavens. They need a bit of shelter till\nthey get on their feet an' I have no room for them. You can put them up in the loft if you like but that wouldn't do because the small ones wouldn't be able to climb and they'd fall down an' get killed so you go up there an' they can move in here.\nAll right, all right, all right, all right.\nHe hoists himself from the bed and there's a whiskey smell. He goes to the kitchen and pulls the table to the wall for his climb to the loft.\nGrandma says, That's fine now. Ye can move up here tonight an' ye won't have the eviction men coming after ye.\nGrandma tells Mam she's going home. She's tired and drenched and she's not twenty-five anymore. She says there's no need to be taking beds or furniture with all the stuff that's up in Laman Griffin's. We put Alphie in the pram and pile around him the pot, the pan, the kettle, the jam jars and mugs, the Pope, two bolsters and the coats from the beds. We drape the coats over our heads and push the pram through the streets. Mam tells us be quiet going up the lane or the neighbors will know we got the eviction and there will be shame. The pram has a bockety wheel which tilts it and makes it go in different directions. We try to keep it straight and we're having a great time because it must be after midnight and surely Mam won't make us go to school tomorrow. We're moving so far from Leamy's School now maybe we'll never have to go again. Once we get away from the lane Alphie bangs on the pot with the spoon and Michael sings a song he heard in a film with Al Jolson, Swanee, how I love ya, how I love ya, my dear ol'Swanee. He makes us laugh the way he tries to sing in a deep voice like Al Jolson.\nMam says she's glad it's late and there's no one on the streets to see our shame.\nOnce we get to the house we take Alphie and everything else from the pram so that Malachy and I can run back down to Roden Lane for the trunk. Mam says she'd die if she lost that trunk and everything in it.\nMalachy and I sleep at opposite ends of the small bed. Mam takes the big bed with Alphie beside her and Michael at the bottom. Everything is damp and musty and Laman Griffin snores over our heads. There are no stairs in this house and that means no angel ever on the seventh step.\nBut I'm twelve going on thirteen and I might be too old for angels.\nIt's still dark when the alarm goes off in the morning and Laman Griffin snorts and blows his nose and hawks the stuff from his chest. The floor creaks under him and when he pisses for ages into the chamber pot we have to stuff our mouths with coats to stop the laughing and Mam hisses at us to be quiet. He grumbles away above us before he climbs down to get his bicycle and bang his way out the door. Mam whispers, The coast is clear, go back to sleep. Ye can stay at home today.\nWe can't sleep. We're in a new house, we have to pee and we want to explore. The lavatory is outside, about ten steps from the back door, our own lavatory, with a door you can close and a proper seat where you can sit and read squares of the Limerick Leader Laman Griffin left behind for wiping himself. There is a long backyard, a garden with tall grass and weeds, an old bicycle that must have belonged to a giant, tin cans galore, old papers and magazines rotting into the earth, a rusted sewing machine, a dead cat with a rope around his neck that somebody must have thrown over the fence.\nMichael gets a notion in his head that this is Africa and keeps asking, Where's Tarzan? Where's Tarzan? He runs up and down the backyard with no pants on trying to imitate Tarzan yodeling from tree to tree. Malachy looks over the fences into the other yards and tells us, They have gardens. They're growing things. We can grow things. We can have our own spuds and everything.\nMam calls from the back door, See if ye can find anything to start the fire in here.\nThere's a wooden shed built against the back of the house. It's collapsing and surely we could use some of the wood for the fire. Mam is\ndisgusted with the wood we bring in. She says it's rotten and full of white maggots but beggars can't be choosers. The wood sizzles above the burning paper and we watch the white maggots try to escape. Michael says he feels sorry for the white maggots but we know he's sorry for everything in the world.\nMam tells us this house used to be a shop, that Laman Griffin's mother sold groceries through the little window and that's how she was able to send Laman away to Rockwell College so that he could wind up as an officer in the Royal Navy. Oh, he was, indeed. An officer in the Royal Navy, and here's a picture of him with other officers all having dinner with a famous American film star Jean Harlow. He was never the same after he met Jean Harlow. He fell madly in love with her but what was the use? She was Jean Harlow and he was nothing but an officer in the Royal Navy and it drove him to drink and they threw him out of the Navy. Now look at him, a common laborer for the Electricity Supply Board and a house that's a disgrace. You'd look at this house and never know there was a human being living in it. You can see Laman never moved a thing since his mother died and now we have to clean up so that we can live in this place.\nThere are boxes packed with bottles of purple hair oil. While Mam is out in the lavatory we open a bottle and smear it on our heads. Malachy says the smell is gorgeous but when Mam comes back she says, What's that horrible stink? and wants to know why our heads are suddenly greasy. She makes us stick our heads under the tap outside and dry ourselves with an old towel pulled out from under a pile of magazines called The Illustrated London News so old they have pictures of Queen Victoria and Prince Edward waving. There are bars of Pear's soap and a thick book called Pear's Encyclopedia, which keeps me up day and night because it tells you everything about everything and that's all I want to know.\nThere are bottles of Sloan's Liniment, which Mam says will come in handy when we get cramps and pains from the damp. The bottles say, Here's the pain, Where's the Sloan's? There are boxes of safety pins and bags packed with women's hats that crumble when you touch them. There are bags with corsets, garters, women's high button shoes and different laxatives that promise glowing cheeks, bright eyes and a curl in your hair. There are letters from General Eoin O'Duffy to Gerard Griffin, Esq., saying welcome to the ranks of the National Front, the Irish Blueshirts, that it is a privilege to know a man like Gerard Griffin is interested in the movement with his excellent education, his Royal Navy training, his reputation as a great rugby player on the Young Munster team that won the national championship, the Bateman Cup. General O'Duffy is forming an Irish Brigade that will soon sail off to Spain to fight with that great Catholic Generalissimo Franco himself, and Mr. Griffin would be a powerful addition to the Brigade.\nMam says Laman's mother wouldn't let him go. She didn't spend all those years slaving away in a little shop to send him to college so that he could go gallivanting off to Spain for Franco so he stayed at home and got that job digging holes for the poles of the Electricity Supply Board along country roads and his mother was happy to have him home to herself every night but Friday when he drank his pint and moaned over Jean Harlow.\nMam is happy we'll have loads of paper for lighting the fire though the wood we burn from that collapsing shed leaves a sickening smell and she worries the white maggots will escape and breed.\nWe work all day moving boxes and bags to the shed outside. Mam opens all the windows to air the house and let out the smell of the hair oil and the years of no air. She says it's a relief to be able to see the floor again and now we can sit down and have a nice cup of tea in peace, ease and comfort, and won't it be lovely when the warm weather comes and we might be able to have a garden and sit outside with our tea the way the English do.\nLaman Griffin comes home at six every night but Friday, has his tea and goes to bed till next morning. Saturdays he goes to bed at one in the afternoon and stays there till Monday morning. He pulls the kitchen table over to the wall under the loft, climbs up on a chair, pulls the chair up to the table, climbs up on the chair again, catches a leg of the bed, pulls himself up. If he's too drunk on Fridays he makes me climb up for his pillow and blankets and sleeps on the kitchen floor by the fire or falls into bed with me and my brothers and snores and farts all night.\nWhen we first moved in he complained over how he gave up his room downstairs for the loft and he's worn out climbing up and down to go to the lavatory in the backyard. He calls down, Bring the table, the chair, I'm coming down, and we have to clear off the table and pull it to the wall. He's fed up, he's finished with the climbing, he's going to use his mother's lovely chamber pot. He lies in bed all day reading books from the library, smoking Gold Flake cigarettes and throwing Mam a few shillings to send one of us to the shop so that he can have scones with his tea or a nice bit of ham and sliced tomato. Then he calls to Mam, Angela, this chamber pot is full, and she drags chair and table to climb for the chamber pot, empty it in the lavatory outside, rinse it and climb back to the loft. Her face gets tight and she says, Is there anything else your lordship would like this day? and he laughs, Woman's work, Angela, woman's work and free rent.\nLaman throws down his library card from the loft and tells me get him two books, one on angling, one on gardening. He writes a note to the librarian to say his legs are killing him from digging holes for the Electricity Supply Board and from now on Frank McCourt will be getting his books. He knows the boy is only thirteen going on fourteen and he knows the rules are strict about allowing children into the adult part of the library but the boy will wash his hands and behave himself and do what he's told, thank you.\nThe librarian reads the note and says 'tis an awful pity about Mr. Griffin, he's a true gentleman and a man of great learning, you wouldn't believe the books he reads, sometimes four a week, that one day he took home a book in French, French, if you don't mind, on the history of the rudder, the rudder, if you don't mind, she'd give anything for a look inside his head for it must be packed with all sorts of learning, packed, if you don't mind.\nShe picks out a gorgeous book with colored pictures about English gardens. She says, I know what he likes in the fishing department, and chooses a book called In Search of the Irish Salmon by Brigadier General Hugh Colton. Oh, says the librarian, he reads hundreds of books about English officers fishing in Ireland. I've read some myself out of pure curiosity and you can see why those officers are glad to be in Ireland after all they put up with in India and Africa and other desperate\nplaces. At least the people here are polite. We're known for that, the politeness, not running around throwing spears at people.\nLaman lies in the bed, reads his books, talks down from the loft about the day his legs will heal and he'll be out there in the back planting a garden which will be famous far and wide for color and beauty and when he's not gardening he'll be roaming the rivers around Limerick and bringing home salmon that will make your mouth water. His mother left a recipe for salmon that's a family secret and if he had the time and his legs weren't killing him he'd find it someplace in this house. He says now that I'm reliable I can get a book for myself every week but don't be bringing home filth. I want to know what the filth is but he won't tell me so I'll have to find out for myself.\nMam says she wants to join the library too but it's a long walk from Laman's house, two miles, and would I mind getting her a book every week, a romance by Charlotte M. Brame or any other nice writer. She doesn't want any books about English officers looking for salmon or books about people shooting each other. There's enough trouble in the world without reading about people bothering fish and each other.\nGrandma caught a chill the night we had the trouble in the house in Roden Lane and the chill turned into pneumonia. They shifted her to the City Home Hospital and now she's dead.\nHer oldest son, my uncle Tom, thought he'd go to England to work like other men in the lanes of Limerick but his consumption got worse and he came back to Limerick and now he's dead.\nHis wife, Galway Jane, followed him, and four of their six children had to be put into orphanages. The oldest boy, Gerry, ran away and joined the Irish army, deserted and crossed to the English army. The oldest girl, Peggy, went to Aunt Aggie and lives in misery.\nThe Irish army is looking for boys who are musical and would like to train in the Army School of Music. They accept my brother, Malachy, and he goes off to Dublin to be a soldier and play the trumpet.\nNow I have only two brothers at home and Mam says her family is disappearing before her very eyes.\nXIII\nBoys from my class at Leamy's School are going on a weekend cycling trip to Killaloe. They tell me I should borrow a bicycle and come. All I need is a blanket, a few spoons of tea and sugar and a few cuts of bread to keep me going. I'll learn to cycle on Laman Griffin's bicycle every night after he goes to bed and he'll surely let me borrow it for the two days in Killaloe.\nThe best time to ask him for anything is Friday night when he's in a good mood after his night of drinking and his dinner. He brings home the same dinner in his overcoat pockets, a big steak dripping blood, four potatoes, an onion, a bottle of stout. Mam boils the potatoes and fries the steak with sliced onion. He keeps his overcoat on, sits at the table and eats the steak out of his hands. The grease and blood roll down his chin and on to the overcoat where he wipes his hands. He drinks his stout and laughs that there's nothing like a great bloody steak of a Friday night and if that's the worst sin he ever commits he'll float to heaven body and soul, ha ha ha.\nOf course you can have my bike, he says. Boy should be able to get out and see the countryside. Of course. But you have to earn it. You can't be getting something for nothing, isn't that right?\n'Tis.\nAnd I have a job for you. You don't mind doing a bit of a job, do\nyou?\nI don't.\nAnd you'd like to help your mother?\nI would.\nWell, now, that very chamber pot is full since this morning. I want\nyou to climb up and get it and take it to the lavatory and rinse it under the tap abroad and climb back up with it.\nI don't want to empty his chamber pot but I dream of cycling miles on the road to Killaloe, fields and sky far from this house, a swim in the Shannon, a night sleeping in a barn. I pull the table and chair to the wall. I climb up and under the bed there's the plain white chamber pot streaked brown and yellow, brimming with piss and shit. I lay it gently at the edge of the loft so that it won't spill, climb down to the chair, reach for the chamber pot, bring it down, turn my face away, hold it while I step down to the table, place it on the chair, step to the floor, take the chamber pot to the lavatory, empty it, and get sick behind the lavatory till I get used to this job.\nLaman says I'm a good boy and the bike is mine anytime I want it as long as the chamber pot is empty and I'm there to run to the shop for his cigarettes, go to the library for books and do whatever else he wants. He says, You have a great way with a chamber pot. He laughs and Mam stares into the dead ashes in the fireplace.\nIt's raining so hard one day, Miss O'Riordan the librarian says, Don't go out in that or you'll ruin the books you're carrying. Sit down over there and behave yourself. You can read all about the saints while you're waiting.\nThere are four big books, Butler's Lives of the Saints. I don't want to spend my life reading about saints but when I start I wish the rain would last forever. Whenever you see pictures of saints, men or women, they're always looking up to heaven where there are clouds filled with little fat angels carrying flowers or harps giving praise. Uncle Pa Keating says he can't think of a single saint in heaven he'd want to sit down and have a pint with. The saints in these books are different. There are stories about virgins, martyrs, virgin martyrs and they're worse than any horror film at the Lyric Cinema.\nI have to look in the dictionary to find out what a virgin is. I know the Mother of God is the Virgin Mary and they call her that because she didn't have a proper husband, only poor old St. Joseph. In the Lives of the Saints the virgins are always getting into trouble and I don't know why. The dictionary says, Virgin, woman (usually a young woman) who is and remains in a state of inviolate chastity.\nNow I have to look up inviolate and chastity and all I can find here is that inviolate means not violated and chastity means chaste and that means pure from unlawful sexual intercourse. Now I have to look up intercourse and that leads to intromission, which leads to intromittent, the copulatory organ of any male animal. Copulatory leads to copulation, the union of the sexes in the art of generation and I don't know what that means and I'm too weary going from one word to another in this heavy dictionary which leads me on a wild goose chase from this word to that\nword and all because the people who wrote the dictionary don't want the likes of me to know anything.\nAll I want to know is where I came from but if you ask anyone they tell you ask someone else or send you from word to word.\nAll these virgin martyrs are told by Roman judges they have to give up their faith and accept the Roman gods but they say, Nay, and the judges have them tortured and killed. My favorite is St. Christina the Astonishing who takes ages to die. The judge says, Cut off her breast, and when they do she throws it at him and he goes deaf dumb and blind. Another judge is brought on the case and he says, Cut off the other breast, and the same thing happens. They try to kill her with arrows but they just bounce off her and kill the soldiers who shot them. They try to boil her in oil but she rocks in the vat and takes a nap for herself. Then the judges get fed up and have her head cut off and that does the job. The feast of St. Christina the Astonishing is the twenty-fourth of July and I think I'll keep that for myself along with the feast of St. Francis of Assisi on the fourth of October. The librarian says, You have to go home now, the rain is stopped, and when I'm going out the door she calls me back. She wants to write a note to my mother and she doesn't mind one bit if I read it. The note says, Dear Mrs. McCourt, Just when you think Ireland is gone to the dogs altogether you find a boy sitting in the library so absorbed in the Lives of the Saints he doesn't realize the rain has stopped and you have to drag him away from the aforesaid Lives. I think, Mrs. McCourt, you might have a future priest on your hands and I will light a candle in hopes it comes true. I remain, Yours truly, Catherine O'Riordan, Asst. Librarian.\nHoppy O'Halloran is the only master in Leamy's National School who ever sits. That's because he's the headmaster or because he has to rest himself from the twisting walk that comes from the short leg. The other masters walk back and forth in the front of the room or up and down the aisles and you never know when you'll get a whack of a cane or a slap of a strap for giving the wrong answer or writing something sloppy. If Hoppy wants to do anything to you he calls you to the front of the room to punish you before three classes.\nThere are good days when he sits at the desk and talks about America. He says, My boys, from the frozen wastes of North Dakota to the fragrant orange groves of Florida, Americans enjoy all climates. He talks about American history, If the American farmer, with flintlock and musket, could wrest from the English a continent, surely we, warriors ever, can recover our island.\nIf we don't want him tormenting us with algebra or Irish grammar all we have to do is ask him a question about America and that gets him so excited he might go on for the whole day.\nHe sits at his desk and recites the tribes and chiefs he loves. Arapaho, Cheyenne, Chippewa, Sioux, Apache, Iroquois. Poetry, my boys, poetry. And listen to the chiefs, Kicking Bear, Rain-in-the-Face, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and the genius, Geronimo.\nIn seventh class he hands out a small book, a poem that goes on for pages and pages, The Deserted Village, by Oliver Goldsmith. He says that this seems to be a poem about England but it is a lament for the poet's native land, our own native land, Ireland. We are to get this poem by heart, twenty lines a night to be recited every morning. Six boys are called to the front of the room for reciting and if you miss a line you are slapped twice on each hand. He tells us put the books under the desks\nand the whole class chants the passage on the schoolmaster in the village.\nBeside yon straggling fence that skirts the way, With blossomed furze unprofitably gay,\nThere, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule\nThe village master taught his little school.\nA man severe he was and stern to view, I knew him well, and every truant knew.\nFull well the boding tremblers learned to trace The day's disaster in his morning face.\nFull well they laughed with counterfeited glee At all his jokes for many a joke had he.\nFull well the busy whisper circling round Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned.\nHe always closes his eyes and smiles when we reach the last lines of the passage, Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught, The love he bore to learning was in fault.\nThe village all declared how much he knew.\n'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too. Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage, And even the story ran that he could gauge.\nIn arguing, too, the parson owned his skill, For, even though vanquished, he could argue still, While words of learned length and thundering sound Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around.\nAnd still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, That one small head could carry all he knew.\nWe know he loves these lines because they're about a schoolmaster, about him, and he's right because we wonder how one small head could carry all he knows and we will remember him in these lines. He says, Ah, boys, boys, You can make up your own minds but first stock them. Are you listening to me? Stock your minds and you can move through the world resplendent. Clarke, define resplendent.\nI think it's shining, sir.\nPithy, Clarke, but adequate. McCourt, give us a sentence with pithy.\nClarke is pithy but adequate, sir.\nAdroit, McCourt. You have a mind for the priesthood, my boy, or politics. Think of that.\nI will, sir.\nTell your mother come and see me.\nI will, sir.\nMam says, No, I could never go near Mr. O'Halloran. I don't have a\ndecent dress or a proper coat. What does he want to see me for? I don't know.\nWell, ask him.\nI can't. He'll kill me. If he says bring your mother you have to bring your mother or out comes the stick.\nShe comes to see him and he talks to her in the hallway. He tells her that her son Frank must continue school. He must not fall into the\nmessenger boy trap. That leads nowhere. Take him up to the Christian Brothers, tell them I sent you, tell them he is a bright boy and ought to be going to secondary school and beyond that, university.\nHe tells her he did not become headmaster of Leamy's National School to preside over an academy of messenger boys.\nMam says, Thank you, Mr. O'Halloran.\nI wish Mr. O'Halloran would mind his own business. I don't want to go to the Christian Brothers. I want to quit school forever and get a job, get my wages every Friday, go to the pictures on Saturday nights like everyone.\nA few days later Mam tells me give my face and hands a good wash, we're going to the Christian Brothers. I tell her I don't want to go, I want to work, I want to be a man. She tells me stop the whining, I'm going to secondary school and we'll all manage somehow. I'm going to school if she has to scrub floors and she'll practice on my face.\nShe knocks on the door at the Christian Brothers and says she wants to see the superior, Brother Murray. He comes to the door, looks at my mother and me and says, What?\nMam says, This is my son, Frank. Mr. O'Halloran at Leamy's says he's bright and would there be any chance of getting him in here for secondary school?\nWe don't have room for him, says Brother Murray and closes the door in our faces.\nMam turns away from the door and it's a long silent walk home. She takes off her coat, makes tea, sits by the fire. Listen to me, she says. Are you listening?\nI am.\nThat's the second time a door was slammed in your face by the Church.\nIs it? I don't remember.\nStephen Carey told you and your father you couldn't and closed the door in your face. Do you remember that?\nI do.\nAnd now Brother Murray slams the door in your face. I don't mind. I want to get a job.\nHer face tightens and she's angry. You are never to\nbe an altar boy\nlet anybody\nslam the door in your face again. Do you hear me?\nShe starts to cry by the fire, Oh, God, I didn't bring ye into the\nworld to be a family of messenger boys.\nI don't know what to do or say, I'm so relieved I don't have to\nstay in school for five or six more years. I'm free.\nI'm thirteen going on fourteen and it's June, the last month of school forever. Mam takes me to see the priest, Dr. Cowpar, about getting a job as telegram boy. The supervisor in the post office, Mrs. O'Connell, says, Do you know how to cycle, and I lie that I do. She says I can't start till I'm fourteen so come back in August.\nMr. O'Halloran tells the class it's a disgrace that boys like McCourt, Clarke, Kennedy, have to hew wood and draw water. He is disgusted by this free and independent Ireland that keeps a class system foisted on us by the English, that we are throwing our talented children on the dungheap.\nYou must get out of this country, boys. Go to America, McCourt. Do you hear me?\nI do, sir.\nPriests come to the school to recruit us for the foreign missions, Redemptorists, Franciscans, Holy Ghost Fathers, all converting the distant heathen. I ignore them. I'm going to America till one priest catches my attention. He says he comes from the order of the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic Bedouin tribes and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.\nI ask for the application.\nI will need a letter from the parish priest and a physical examination by my family doctor. The parish priest writes the letter on the spot. He would have been glad to see me go last year. The doctor says, What's this?\nThat's an application to join the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic tribes of the Sahara and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.\nOh, yeh? French Foreign Legion, is it? Do you know the preferred form of transportation in the Sahara Desert?\nTrains?\nNo. It's the camel. Do you know what a camel is?\nIt has a hump. It has more than a hump. It has a nasty, mean\ndisposition and its teeth are green with gangrene and it bites. Do you know where it bites?\nIn the Sahara?\nNo, you omadhaun. It bites your shoulder, rips it right off. Leaves you standing there tilted in the Sahara. How would you like that, eh? And what class of a spectacle you'd be strolling down the street, lopsided in Limerick. What girl in her right mind will look at an ex-White Father with one miserable scrawny shoulder? And look at your eyes. They're bad enough here in Limerick. In the Sahara they'll fester and rot and fall out of your head. How old are you?\nThirteen.\nGo home to your mother.\nIt's not our house and we don't feel free in it the way we did in\nRoden Lane, up in Italy or down in Ireland. When Laman comes home he wants to read in his bed or sleep and we have to be quiet. We stay in the streets till after dark and when we come inside there's nothing to do but go to bed and read a book if we have a candle or paraffin oil for the lamp.\nMam tells us go to bed, she'll be after us in a minute as soon as she climbs to the loft with Laman's last mug of tea. We often fall asleep before she goes up but there are nights we hear them talking, grunting, moaning. There are nights when she never comes down and Michael and Alphie have the big bed to themselves. Malachy says she stays up there because it's too hard for her to climb down in the dark.\nHe's only twelve and he doesn't understand.\nI'm thirteen and I think they're at the excitement up there.\nI know about the excitement and I know it's a sin but how can it be\na sin if it comes to me in a dream where American girls pose in swimming suits on the screen at the Lyric Cinema and I wake up pushing and pumping? It's a sin when you're wide awake and going at yourself the way the boys talked about it in Leamy's schoolyard after Mr. O'Dea roared the Sixth Commandment at us, Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery, which means impure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, and that's what adultery is, Dirty Things in General.\nOne Redemptorist priest barks at us all the time about the Sixth Commandment. He says impurity is so grave a sin the Virgin Mary turns her face away and weeps.\nAnd why does she weep, boys? She weeps because of you and what you are doing to her Beloved Son. She weeps when she looks down the long dreary vista of time and beholds in horror the spectacle of Limerick boys defiling themselves, polluting themselves, interfering with themselves, abusing themselves, soiling their young bodies, which are the temples of the Holy Ghost. Our Lady weeps over these abominations knowing that every time you interfere with yourself you nail to the cross her Beloved Son, that once more you hammer into His dear head the crown of thorns, that you reopen those ghastly wounds. In an agony of thirst He hangs on the cross and what is He offered by those perfidious Romans? A lavatory sponge plunged into vinegar and gall and thrust into His poor mouth, a mouth that moves rarely except to pray, to pray even for you, boys, even for you who nailed Him to that cross. Consider Our Lord's suffering. Consider the crown of thorns. Consider a small pin driven into your skull, the agony of the piercing. Consider then twenty thorns driven into your head. Reflect, meditate on the nails tearing His hands, His feet. Could you endure a fraction of that agony? Take that pin again, that mere pin. Force it into your side. Enlarge that sensation a hundredfold and you are penetrated by that awful lance. Oh, boys, the devil wants your souls. He wants you with him in hell and know this, that every time you interfere with yourself, every time you succumb to the vile sin of self- abuse you not only nail Christ to the cross you take another step closer to hell itself. Retreat from the abyss, boys. Resist the devil and keep your hands to yourself.\nI can't stop interfering with myself. I pray to the Virgin Mary and tell her I'm sorry I put her Son back on the cross and I'll never do it again but I can't help myself and swear I'll go to confession and after that, surely after that, I'll never never do it again. I don't want to go to hell with devils chasing me for eternity jabbing me with hot pitchforks.\nThe priests of Limerick have no patience with the likes of me. I go to confession and they hiss that I'm not in a proper spirit of repentance, that if I were I'd give up this hideous sin. I go from church to church looking for an easy priest till Paddy Clohessy tells me there's one in the Dominican church who's ninety years old and deaf as a turnip. Every few weeks the old priest hears my confession and mumbles that I should pray for him. Sometimes he falls asleep and I don't have the heart to wake him up so I go to Communion the next day without penance or absolution. It's not my fault if priests fall asleep on me and surely I'm in a state of grace just for going to confession. Then one day the little panel in the confession box slides back and it's not my man at all, it's a young priest with a big ear like a seashell. He'll surely hear everything.\nBless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession.\nAnd what have you done since then, my child?\nI hit my brother, I went on the mooch from school, I lied to my mother.\nYes, my child, and what else?\nI \u2013 I - I did dirty things, Father.\nAh, my child, was that with yourself or with another or with some class of beast?\nSome class of beast. I never heard of a sin like that before. This priest must be from the country and if he is he's opening up new worlds to me.\nThe night before I'm to go to Killaloe Laman Griffin comes home drunk and eats a great bag of fish and chips at the table. He tells Mam boil water for tea and when she says she has no coal or turf he yells at her and calls her a great lump living free under his roof with her pack of brats. He throws money at me to go to the shop for a few sods of turf and wood for kindling. I don't want to go. I want to hit him for the way he treats my mother but if I say anything he won't let me have the bicycle tomorrow after I've waited three weeks.\nWhen Mam gets the fire going and boils the water I remind him of his promise to loan me the bike.\nDid you empty the chamber pot today?\nOh, I forgot. I'll do it this minute.\nHe shouts, You didn't empty my damn chamber pot. I promise you the\nbike. I give you tuppence a week to run messages for me and empty the chamber pot and you stand there with your thick gob hanging out and tell me you didn't do it.\nI'm sorry. I forgot. I'll do it now.\nYou will, will you? And how do you think you'll get up to the loft? Are you going to pull the table out from under my fish and chips?\nMam says, Sure, he was at school all day and he had to go to the doctor for his eyes.\nWell, you can bloody well forget about the bicycle. You didn't live up to the bargain.\nBut he couldn't do it, says Mam.\nHe tells her shut up and mind her own business and she goes quiet by the fire. He goes back to his fish and chips but I tell him again, You promised me. I emptied that chamber pot and did your messages for three weeks.\nShut up and go to bed.\nYou can't tell me go to bed. You're not my father, and you promised\nme.\nI'm telling you, as sure as God made little apples, that if I get\nup from this table you'll be calling for your patron saint. You promised me.\nHe pushes the chair back from the table. He stumbles toward me and sticks his finger between my eyes. I'm telling you shut your gob, scabby\neyes.\nI won't. You promised me.\nHe punches my shoulders and when I won't stop moves to my head. My\nmother jumps up, crying, and tries to pull him away. He punches and kicks me into the bedroom but I keep saying, You promised me. He knocks me to my mother's bed and punches till I cover my face and head with my arms.\nI'll kill you, you little shit.\nMam is screaming and pulling at him till he falls backward into the kitchen. She says, Come on, oh, come on. Eat your fish and chips. He's only a child. He'll get over it. I hear him go back to his chair and pull it to the table.\nI hear him snuffle and slurp when he eats and drinks. Hand me the matches, he says. By Jesus, I need a fag after that. There's a put-put sound when he puffs on the cigarette and a whimper from my mother.\nHe says, I'm going to bed, and with the drink in him it takes him a while to climb the chair to the table, pull up the chair, climb to the loft. The bed squeaks under him and he grunts when he pulls off his boots and drops them to the floor.\nI can hear Mam crying when she blows into the globe of the paraffin oil lamp and everything goes dark. After what happened she'll surely want to get into her own bed and I'm ready to go to the small one against the wall. Instead, there's the sound of her climbing the chair, the table, the chair, crying up into the loft and telling Laman Griffin, He's only a boy, tormented with his eyes, and when Laman says, He's a little shit and I want him out of the house, she cries and begs till there's whispering and grunting and moaning and nothing.\nIn awhile they're snoring in the loft and my brothers are asleep around me. I can't stay in this house for if Laman Griffin comes at me again I'll take a knife to his neck. I don't know what to do or where to go.\nI leave the house and follow the streets from the Sarsfield Barracks to the Monument Caf\u00e9. I dream of how I'll get back at Laman some day. I'll go to America and see Joe Louis. I'll tell him my troubles and he'll understand because he comes from a poor family. He'll show me how to build up my muscles, how to hold my hands and use my feet. He'll show me how to dig my chin into my shoulder the way he does and how to let go with a right uppercut that will send Laman flying. I'll drag Laman to the graveyard at Mungret where his family and Mam's family are buried and I'll cover him with earth all the way to his chin so that he won't be able to move and he'll beg for his life and I'll say, End of the road, Laman, you're going to meet your Maker, and he'll beg and beg while I trickle dirt on his face till it's covered completely and he's gasping and asking God for forgiveness for not giving me the bike and punching me all over the house and doing the excitement with my mother and I'll be laughing away because he's not in a state of grace after the excitement and he's going to hell as sure as God made little apples as he used to say himself.\nThe streets are dark and I have to keep an eye out in case I might be lucky like Malachy long ago and find fish and chips dropped by drunken soldiers. There's nothing on the ground. If I find my uncle, Ab Sheehan, he might give me some of his Friday night fish and chips, but they tell me in the caf\u00e9 he came and went already. I'm thirteen now so I don't call him Uncle Pat anymore. I call him Ab or The Abbot like everybody else. Surely if I go to Grandma's house he'll give me a piece of bread or something and maybe he'll let me stay the night. I can tell him I'll be working in a few weeks delivering telegrams and getting big tips at the post office and ready to pay my own way.\nHe's sitting up in bed finishing his fish and chips, dropping to the floor the Limerick Leader they were wrapped in, wiping his mouth and hands with the blanket. He looks at me, That face is all swole. Did you fall on that face?\nI tell him I did because there's no use telling him anything else. He wouldn't understand. He says, You can stay in me mother's bed tonight. You can't walk the streets with that face and them two red eyes in your head.\nHe says there's no food in the house, not a scrap of bread, and when he falls asleep I take the greasy newspaper from the floor. I lick the front page, which is all advertisements for films and dances in the city. I lick the headlines. I lick the great attacks of Patton and Montgomery in France and Germany. I lick the war in the Pacific. I lick the obituaries and the sad memorial poems, the sports pages, the market prices of eggs butter and bacon. I suck the paper till there isn't a smidgen of grease.\nI wonder what I'll do tomorrow.\nXIV\nIn the morning The Abbot gives me the money to go to Kathleen O'Connell's for bread, margarine, tea, milk. He boils water on the gas ring and tells me I can have a mug of tea and, Go aisy with the sugar, I'm not a millionaire. You can have a cut o' bread but don't make it too thick.\nIt's July and school is over forever. In a few weeks I'll be delivering telegrams at the post office, working like a man. In the weeks I'm idle I can do anything I like, get up in the morning, stay in bed, take long walks out the country like my father, wander around Limerick. If I had the money I'd go over to the Lyric Cinema, eat sweets, see Errol Flynn conquering everyone in sight. I can read the English and Irish papers The Abbot brings home or I can use the library cards of Laman Griffin and my mother till I'm found out.\nMam sends Michael with a milk bottle of warm tea, a few cuts of bread smeared with dripping, a note to say Laman Griffin isn't angry anymore and I can come back. Michael says, Are you coming home, Frankie?\nNo.\nAh, do, Frankie. Come on.\nI live here now. I'm never going back.\nBut Malachy is gone to the army and you're here and I have no big\nbrother. All the boys have big brothers and I only have Alphie. He's not even four and can't talk right.\nI can't go back. I'm never going back. You can come here any time you like.\nHis eyes glint with tears and that gives me such a pain in my heart I want to say, All right, I'll come with you. I'm only saying that. I know I'll never be able to face Laman Griffin again and I don't know if I can look at my mother. I watch Michael go up the lane with the sole of his shoe broken and clacking along the pavement. When I start that job at the post office I'll buy him shoes so I will. I'll give him an egg and take him to the Lyric Cinema for the film and the sweets and then we'll go to Naughton's and eat fish and chips till our bellies are sticking out a mile. I'll get money some day for a house or a flat with electric light and a lavatory and beds with sheets blankets pillows like the rest of the world. We'll have breakfast in a bright kitchen with flowers dancing in a garden beyond, delicate cups and saucers, eggcups, eggs soft in the yolk and ready to melt the rich creamery butter, a teapot with a cozy on it, toast with butter and marmalade galore. We'll take our time and listen to music from the BBC or the American Armed Forces Network. I'll buy proper clothes for the whole family so our arses won't be hanging out of our pants and we won't have the shame. The thought of the shame brings a pain\nin my heart and starts me sniffling. The Abbot says, What's up with you? Didn't you have your bread? Didn't you have your tay? What more do you want? 'Tis an egg you'll be lookin' for next.\nThere's no use talking to someone who was dropped on his head and sells papers for a living.\nHe complains he can't be feeding me forever and I'll have to get my own bread and tea. He doesn't want to come home and find me reading in the kitchen with the electric lightbulb blazing away. He can read numbers so he can and when he goes out to sell papers he reads the electric meter so he'll know how much I used and if I don't stop turning on that light he'll take the fuse out and carry it in his pocket and if I put another fuse in he'll have the electricity pulled out altogether and go back to gas, which was good enough for his poor dead mother and will surely suit him for all he does is sit up in the bed to eat his fish and chips and count his money before he goes to sleep.\nI get up early like Dad and go on long walks into the country. I walk around the graveyard in the old abbey at Mungret where my mother's relations are buried and I go up the boreen to the Norman castle at Carrigogunnell where Dad brought me twice. I climb to the top and Ireland is spread out before me, the Shannon shining its way to the Atlantic. Dad told me this castle was built hundreds of years ago and if you wait for the larks to stop their singing over there you can hear the Normans below hammering and talking and getting ready for battle. Once he brought me here in the dark so that we could hear Norman and Irish voices down through the centuries and I heard them. I did.\nSometimes I'm up there alone on the heights of Carrigogunnell and there are voices of Norman girls from olden times laughing and singing in French and when I see them in my mind I'm tempted and I climb to the very top of the castle where once there was a tower and there in full view of Ireland I interfere with myself and spurt all over Carrigogunnell and fields beyond.\nThat's a sin I could never tell a priest. Climbing to great heights and going at yourself before all of Ireland is surely worse than doing it in a private place with yourself or with another or with some class of a beast. Somewhere down there in the fields or along the banks of the Shannon a boy or a milkmaid might have looked up and seen me in my sin and if they did I'm doomed because the priests are always saying that anyone who exposes a child to sin will have a millstone tied around his neck and be cast into the sea.\nStill, the thought of someone watching me brings on the excitement again. I wouldn't want a small boy to be watching me. No, no, that would surely lead to the millstone, but if there was a milkmaid gawking up she'd surely get excited and go at herself though I don't know if girls can go at themselves when they don't have anything to go at. No equipment, as Mikey Molloy used to say.\nI wish that old deaf Dominican priest would come back so that I could tell him my troubles with the excitement but he's dead now and I'll have to face a priest who'll go on about the millstone and the doom.\nDoom. That's the favorite word of every priest in Limerick.\nI walk back along O'Connell Avenue and Ballinacurra where people have their bread and milk delivered early to their doorsteps and surely there's no harm if I borrow a loaf or a bottle with every intention of giving it back when I get my job at the post office. I'm not stealing, I'm borrowing, and that's not a mortal sin. Besides, I stood on top of a\ncastle this morning and committed a sin far worse than stealing bread and milk and if you commit one sin you might as well commit a few more because you get the same sentence in hell. One sin, eternity. A dozen sins, eternity.\nMight as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, as my mother would say. I drink the odd pint of milk and leave the bottle so that the milkman won't be blamed for not delivering. I like milkmen because one of them gave me two broken eggs which I swallowed raw with bits of shells and all. He said I'd grow up powerful if I had nothing else but two eggs in a pint of porter every day. Everything you need is in the egg and everything you want is in the pint.\nSome houses get better bread than others. It costs more and that's what I take. I feel sorry for the rich people who will get up in the morning and go to the door and find their bread missing but I can't let myself starve to death. If I starve I'll never have the strength for my telegram boy job at the post office, which means I'll have no money to put back all that bread and milk and no way of saving to go to America and if I can't go to America I might as well jump into the River Shannon. It's only a few weeks till I get my first wages in the post office and surely these rich people won't collapse with the hunger till then. They can always send the maid out for more. That's the difference between the poor and the rich. The poor can't send out for more because there's no money to send out for more and if there was they wouldn't have a maid to send. It's the maids I have to worry about. I have to be careful when I borrow the milk and the bread and they're at the front doors polishing knobs, knockers and letter boxes. If they see me they'll be running to the woman of the house, Oh, madam, madam, there's an urchin beyant that's makin' off with all the milk and bread.\nBeyant. Maids talk like that because they're all from the country, Mullingar heifers, says Paddy Clohessy's uncle, beef to the heels, and they wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.\nI bring home the bread and even if The Abbot is surprised he doesn't say, Where did you get it? because he was dropped on his head and that knocks the curiosity out of you. He just looks at me with his big eyes that are blue in the middle and yellow all around and slurps his tea from the great cracked mug his mother left behind. He tells me, That's me mug and don't be drinkin' your tay oush of ish.\nOush of ish. That's the Limerick slum talk that always worried Dad. He said, I don't want my sons growing up in a Limerick lane saying, Oush of ish. It's common and low-class. Say out of it properly.\nAnd Mam said, I hope it keeps fine for you but you're not doing much to get us oush of ish.\nOut beyond Ballinacurra I climb orchard walls for apples. If there's a dog I move on because I don't have Paddy Clohessy's way of talking to them. Farmers come at me but they're always slow in their rubber boots and even if they jump on a bicycle to chase me I jump over walls where they can't take a bike.\nThe Abbot knows where I got the apples. If you grow up in the lanes of Limerick you're bound to rob the odd orchard sooner or later. Even if you hate apples you have to rob orchards or your pals will say you're a sissy.\nI always offer The Abbot an apple but he won't eat it because of the scarcity of teeth in his head. He has five left and he won't risk leaving them in an apple. If I cut the apple into slices he still won't\neat it because that's not the proper way to eat an apple. That's what he says and if I say, You slice bread before you eat it, don't you? he says, Apples is apples and bread is bread.\nThat's how you talk when you're dropped on your head.\nMichael comes again with warm tea in a milk bottle and two cuts of fried bread. I tell him I don't need it anymore. Tell Mam I'm taking care of myself and I don't need her tea and fried bread, thank you very much. Michael is delighted when I give him an apple and I tell him come every second day and he can have more. That stops him from asking me to go back to Laman Griffin's and I'm glad it stops his tears.\nThere's a market down in Irishtown where the farmers come on Saturdays with their vegetables, hens, eggs, butter. If I'm there early they'll give me a few pennies for helping unload their carts or motor cars. At the end of the day they'll give me vegetables they can't sell, anything crushed, bruised or rotten in parts. One farmer's wife always gives me cracked eggs and tells me, Fry them eggs tomorrow when you come back from Mass in a state of grace for if you ate them eggs with a sin on your sowl they'll stick in your gullet, so they will.\nShe's a farmer's wife and that's how they talk.\nI'm not much better than a beggar now myself the way I stand at the doors of fish and chip shops when they're closing in hopes they might have burnt chips left over or bits of fish floating around in the grease. If they're in a hurry the shop owners will give me the chips and a sheet of paper for wrapping.\nThe paper I like is the News of the World. It's banned in Ireland but people sneak it in from England for the shocking pictures of girls in swimming suits that are almost not there. Then there are stories of people committing all kinds of sins you wouldn't find in Limerick, getting divorces, committing adultery.\nAdultery. I still have to find out what that word means, look it up in the library. I'm sure it's worse than what the masters taught us, bad thoughts, bad words, bad deeds. I take my chips home and get into bed like The Abbot. If he has a few pints taken he sits up eating his chips from the Limerick Leader and singing \"The Road to Rasheen. \" I eat my chips. I lick the News of the World. I lick the stories about people doing shocking things. I lick the girls in their bathing suits and when there's nothing left to lick I look at the girls till The Abbot blows out the light and I'm committing a mortal sin under the blanket.\nI can go to the library any time with Mam's card or Laman Griffin's. I'll never be caught because Laman is too lazy to get out of bed on a Saturday and Mam will never go near a library with the shame of her clothes.\nMiss O'Riordan smiles. The Lives of the Saints are waiting for you, Frank. Volumes and volumes. Butler, O'Hanlon, Baring Gould. I've told the head librarian all about you and she's so pleased she's ready to give you your own grown-up card. Isn't that wonderful?\nThanks, Miss O'Riordan.\nI'm reading all about St. Brigid, virgin, February first. She was so beautiful that men from all over Ireland panted to marry her and her father wanted her to marry someone important. She didn't want to marry anyone so she prayed to God for help and He caused her eye to melt in her head so that it dribbled down her cheek and left such a great welt the men of Ireland lost interest.\nThen there's St. Wilgefortis, virgin martyr, July twentieth. Her mother had nine children, all at the same time, four sets of twins and Wilgefortis the odd one, all winding up martyrs for the faith. Wilgefortis was beautiful and her father wanted to marry her off to the King of Sicily. Wilgefortis was desperate and God helped her by allowing a beard and a mustache to grow on her face, which made the King of Sicily think twice but sent her father into such a rage he had her crucified beard and all.\nSt. Wilgefortis is the one you pray to if you're an Englishwoman with a troublesome husband.\nThe priests never tell us about virgin martyrs like St. Agatha, February fifth. February is a powerful month for virgin martyrs. Sicilian pagans ordered Agatha to give up her faith in Jesus and like all the virgin martyrs she said, Nay. They tortured her, stretched her on the rack, tore her sides with iron hooks, burned her with blazing torches, and she said, Nay, I will not deny Our Lord. They crushed her breasts and cut them off but when they rolled her over hot coals it was more than she could bear so she expired, giving praise.\nVirgin martyrs always died singing hymns and giving praise not minding one bit if lions tore big chunks from their sides and gobbled them on the spot.\nHow is it the priests never told us about St. Ursula and her eleven thousand maiden martyrs, October twenty-first? Her father wanted her to marry a pagan king but she said, I'll go away for awhile, three years, and think about it. So off she goes with her thousand noble ladies-in- waiting and their companions, ten thousand. They sailed around for awhile and traipsed through various countries till they stopped in Cologne where the chief of the Huns asked Ursula to marry him. Nay, she said, and the Huns killed her and the maidens with her. Why couldn't she say yes and save the lives of eleven thousand virgins? Why did virgin martyrs have to be so stubborn?\nI like St. Moling, an Irish bishop. He didn't live in a palace like the bishop of Limerick. He lived in a tree and when other saints visited him for dinner they would sit around on branches like birds having a grand time with their water and dry bread. He was walking along one day and a leper said, Hoy, St. Moling, where are you going? I'm going to Mass, says St. Moling. Well, I'd like to go to Mass too, so why don't you hoist me up on your back and carry me? St. Moling did but he no sooner had the leper up on his back than the leper started to complain. Your hair shirt, he said, is hard on my sores, take it off. St. Moling took off the shirt and off they went again. Then the leper says, I need to blow my nose. St. Moling says, I don't have any class of a handkerchief, use your hand. The leper says, I can't hold on to you and blow my nose at the same time. All right, says St. Moling, you can blow into my hand. That won't do, says the leper, I barely have a hand left with the leprosy and I can't hold on and blow into your hand. If you were a proper saint you'd twist around here and suck the stuff out of my head. St. Moling didn't want to suck the leper's snot but he did and offered it up and praised God for the privilege.\nI could understand my father sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head when he was a baby and desperate but I don't understand why God wanted St. Moling to go around sucking the snot out of lepers' heads. I don't understand God at all and even if I'd like to be a saint and have\neveryone adore me I'd never suck the snot of a leper. I'd like to be a saint but if that's what you have to do I think I'll stay the way I am.\nStill, I'm ready to spend my life in this library reading about virgins and virgin martyrs till I get into trouble with Miss O'Riordan over a book someone left on the table. The author is Lin Y\u00fctang. Anyone can tell this is a Chinese name and I'm curious to know what the Chinese talk about. It's a book of essays about love and the body and one of his words sends me to the dictionary. Turgid. He says, The male organ of copulation becomes turgid and is inserted into the receptive female orifice.\nTurgid. The dictionary says swollen and that's what I am, standing there looking at the dictionary because I know now what Mikey Molloy was talking about all along, that we're no different from the dogs that get stuck in each other in the streets and it's shocking to think of all the mothers and fathers doing the likes of this.\nMy father lied to me for years about the Angel on the Seventh Step.\nMiss O'Riordan wants to know what word I'm looking for. She always looks worried when I'm at the dictionary so I tell her I'm looking for canonize or beatific or any class of a religious word.\nAnd what's this? she says. This is not the Lives of the Saints.\nShe picks up Lin Y\u00fctang and starts reading the page where I left the book face down on the table.\nMother o' God. Is this what you were reading? I saw this in your hand.\nWell, I-I-only wanted to see if the Chinese, if the Chinese, ah, had any saints.\nOh, indeed, you did. This is disgraceful. Filth. No wonder the Chinese are the way they are. But what could you expect of slanty eyes and yellow skin and you, now that I look at you, have a bit of the slanty eye yourself. You are to leave this library at once.\nBut I'm reading the Lives of the Saints.\nOut or I'll call the head librarian and she'll have the guards on you. Out. You should be running to the priest and confessing your sins. Out, and before you go hand me the library cards of your poor mother and Mr. Griffin. I have a good mind to write to your poor mother and I would if I thought it wouldn't destroy her entirely. Lin Y\u00fctang, indeed. Out.\nThere's no use trying to talk to librarians when they're in that state. You could stand there for an hour telling them all you've read about Brigid and Wilgefortis and Agatha and Ursula and the maiden martyrs but all they think about is one word on one page of Lin Y\u00fctang.\nThe People's Park is behind the library. It's a sunny day, the grass is dry, and I'm worn out begging for chips and putting up with librarians who get into a state over turgid and I'm looking at the clouds drifting above the monument and drifting off myself all turgid till I'm having a dream about virgin martyrs in bathing suits in the News of the World pelting Chinese writers with sheeps' bladders and I wake up in a state of excitement with something hot and sticky pumping out of me oh God my male organ of copulation sticking out a mile people in the park giving me curious looks and mothers telling their children come over here love come away from that fella someone should call the guards on him.\nThe day before my fourteenth birthday I see myself in the glass in Grandma's sideboard. The way I look how can I ever start my job at the post office. Everything is torn, shirt, gansey, short pants, stockings, and my shoes are ready to fall off my feet entirely. Relics of oul'\ndecency, my mother would call them. If my clothes are bad I'm worse. No matter how I drench my hair under the tap it sticks out in all directions. The best cure for standing up hair is spit, only it's hard to spit on your own head. You have to let go with a good one up in the air and duck to catch it on your poll. My eyes are red and oozing yellow, there are matching red and yellow pimples all over my face and my front teeth are so black with rot I'll never be able to smile in my life.\nI have no shoulders and I know the whole world admires shoulders. When a man dies in Limerick the women always say, Grand man he was, shoulders that big and wide he wouldn't come in the door for you, had to come in sideways. When I die they'll say, Poor little divil, died without a sign of a shoulder. I wish I had some sign of a shoulder so that people would know I was at least fourteen years of age. All the boys in Leamy's had shoulders except for Fintan Slattery and I don't want to be like him with no shoulders and knees worn away from prayer. If I had any money left I'd light a candle to St. Francis and ask him if there's any chance God could be persuaded to perform a miracle on my shoulders. Or if I had a stamp I could write to Joe Louis and say, Dear Joe, Is there any chance you could tell me where you got your powerful shoulders even though you were poor?\nI have to look decent for my job so I take off all my clothes and stand naked in the backyard washing them under the tap with a bar of carbolic soap. I hang them on Grandma's clothesline, shirt, gansey, pants, stockings, and pray to God it won't rain, pray they'll be dry for tomorrow, which is the start of my life.\nI can't go anywhere in my pelt so I stay in bed all day reading old newspapers, getting excited with the girls in the News of the World and thanking God for the drying sun. The Abbot comes home at five and makes tea downstairs and even though I'm hungry I know he'll grumble if I ask him for anything. He knows the one thing that worries me is he might go to Aunt Aggie and complain I'm staying in Grandma's house and sleeping in her bed and if Aunt Aggie hears that she'll come over and throw me into the street.\nHe hides the bread when he's finished and I can never find it. You would think that one who was never dropped on his head would be able to find the hidden bread of one who was dropped on his head. Then I realize if the bread is not in the house he must take it with him in the pocket of the overcoat he wears winter and summer. The minute I hear him clumping from the kitchen to the backyard lavatory I run downstairs, pull the loaf from the pocket, cut off a thick slice, back into the pocket, up the stairs and into bed. He can never say a word, never accuse me. You'd have to be a thief of the worst class to steal one slice of bread and no one would ever believe him, not even Aunt Aggie. Besides, she'd bark at him and say, What are you doing anyway going around with a loaf of bread in your pocket? That's no place for a loaf of bread.\nI chew the bread slowly. One mouthful every fifteen minutes will make it last and if I wash it down with water the bread will swell in my belly and give me the full feeling.\nI look out the back window to make sure the evening sun is drying my clothes. Other backyards have lines with clothes that are bright and colorful and dance in the wind. Mine hang from the line like dead dogs.\nThe sun is bright but it's cold and damp in the house and I wish I had something to wear in the bed. I have no other clothes and if I touch anything of The Abbot's he'll surely run to Aunt Aggie. All I can find in\nthe wardrobe is Grandma's old black woolen dress. You're not supposed to wear your Grandmother's old dress when she's dead and you're a boy but what does it matter if it keeps you warm and you're in bed under the blankets where no one will ever know. The dress has the smell of old dead grandmother and I worry she might rise from the grave and curse me before the whole family and all assembled. I pray to St. Francis, ask him to keep her in the grave where she belongs, promise him a candle when I start my job, remind him the robe he wore himself wasn't too far from a dress and no one ever tormented him over it and fall asleep with the image of his face in my dream.\nThe worst thing in the world is to be sleeping in your dead grandmother's bed wearing her black dress when your uncle The Abbot falls on his arse outside South's pub after a night of drinking pints and people who can't mind their own business rush to Aunt Aggie's house to tell her so that she gets Uncle Pa Keating to help her carry The Abbot home and upstairs to where you're sleeping and she barks at you, What are you doin' in this house, in that bed? Get up and put on the kettle for tea for your poor uncle Pat that fell down, and when you don't move she pulls the blankets and falls backward like one seeing a ghost and yelling Mother o' God what are you doin' in me dead mother's dress?\nThat's the worst thing of all because it's hard to explain that you're getting ready for the big job in your life, that you washed your clothes, they're drying abroad on the line, and it was so cold you had to wear the only thing you could find in the house, and it's even harder to talk to Aunt Aggie when The Abbot is groaning in the bed, Me feet is like a fire, put water on me feet, and Uncle Pa Keating is covering his mouth with his hand and collapsing against the wall laughing and telling you that you look gorgeous and black suits you and would you ever straighten your hem. You don't know what to do when Aunt Aggie tells you, Get out of that bed and put the kettle on downstairs for tea for your poor uncle. Should you take off the dress and put on a blanket or should you go as you are? One minute she's screaming, What are you doin' in me poor mother's dress? the next she's telling you put on that bloody kettle. I tell her I washed my clothes for the big job.\nWhat big job?\nTelegram boy at the post office.\nShe says if the post office is hiring the likes of you they must be\nin a desperate way altogether, go down and put on that kettle.\nThe next worse thing is to be out in the backyard filling the\nkettle from the tap with the moon beaming away and Kathleen Purcell from next door perched up on the wall looking for her cat. God, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' in your grandmother's dress? and you have to stand there in the dress with the kettle in your hand and explain how you washed your clothes which are hanging there on the line for all to see and you were so cold in the bed you put on your grandmother's dress and your uncle Pat, The Abbot, fell down and was brought home by Aunt Aggie and her husband, Pa Keating, and she drove you into the backyard to fill this kettle and you'll take off this dress as soon as ever your clothes are dry because you never had any desire to go through life in your dead grandmother's dress.\nNow Kathleen Purcell lets out a scream, falls off the wall, forgets the cat, and you can hear her giggling into her blind mother, Mammy, Mammy, wait till I tell you about Frankie McCourt abroad in the backyard in his dead grandmother's dress. You know that once Kathleen Purcell gets\na bit of scandal the whole lane will know it before morning and you might as well stick your head out the window and make a general announcement about yourself and the dress problem.\nBy the time the kettle boils The Abbot is asleep from the drink and Aunt Aggie says she and Uncle Pa will have a drop of tea themselves and she doesn't mind if I have a drop myself. Uncle Pa says on second thought the black dress could be the cassock of a Dominican priest and he goes down on his knees and says, Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Aunt Aggie says, Get up, you oul' eejit, and stop makin' a feck of religion. Then she says, And you what are you doin' in this house?\nI can't tell her about Mam and Laman Griffin and the excitement in the loft. I tell her I was thinking of staying here a while because of the great distance from Laman Griffin's house to the post office and as soon as I get on my feet we'll surely find a decent place and we'll all move on, my mother and brothers and all.\nWell, she says, that's more than your father would do.\nXV\nIt's hard to sleep when you know the next day you're fourteen and starting your first job as a man. The Abbot wakes at dawn moaning. Would I ever make him some tay and if I do I can have a big cut of bread from the half loaf in his pocket which he was keeping there out of the way of the odd rat and if I look in Grandma's gramophone where she used to keep the records I'll find a jar of jam.\nHe can't read, he can't write, but he knows where to hide the jam.\nI bring The Abbot his tea and bread and make some for myself. I put on my damp clothes and get into the bed hoping that if I stay there the clothes will dry from my own heat before I go to work. Mam always says it's the damp clothes that give you the consumption and an early grave. The Abbot is sitting up telling me he has a terrible pain in his head from a dream where I was wearing his poor mother's black dress and she flying around screaming, Sin, sin, 'tis a sin. He finishes his tea and falls into a snore sleep and I wait for his clock to say half-past eight, time to get up and be at the post office at nine even if the clothes are still damp on my skin.\nOn my way out I wonder why Aunt Aggie is coming down the lane. She must be coming to see if The Abbot is dead or needing a doctor. She says, What time do you have to be at that job?\nNine.\nAll right.\nShe turns and walks with me to the post office on Henry Street. She\ndoesn't say a word and I wonder if she's going to the post office to denounce me for sleeping in my grandmother's bed and wearing her black dress. She says, Go up and tell them your aunt is down here waiting for you and you'll be an hour late. If they want to argue I'll go up and argue.\nWhy do I have to be an hour late?\nDo what you're bloody well told.\nThere are telegram boys sitting on a bench along a wall. There are\ntwo women at a desk, one fat, one thin. The thin one says, Yes? My name is Frank McCourt, miss, and I'm here to start work.\nWhat kind of work would that be now?\nTelegram boy, miss.\nThe thin one cackles, Oh, God, I thought you were here to clean the\nlavatories.\nNo, miss. My mother brought a note from the priest, Dr. Cowpar, and\nthere's supposed to be a job.\nOh, there is, is there? And do you know what day this is?\nI do, miss. 'Tis my birthday. I'm fourteen.\nIsn't that grand, says the fat woman. Today is Thursday, says the\nthin woman.\nYour job starts on Monday. Go away and wash yourself and come back then.\nThe telegram boys along the wall are laughing. I don't know why but I feel my face turning hot. I tell the women, Thank you, and on the way out I hear the thin one, Jesus above, Maureen, who dragged in that specimen? and they laugh along with the telegram boys.\nAunt Aggie says, Well? and I tell her I don't start till Monday. She says my clothes are a disgrace and what did I wash them in.\nCarbolic soap.\nThey smell like dead pigeons and you're making a laughingstock of the whole family.\nShe takes me to Roche's Stores and buys me a shirt, a gansey, a pair of short pants, two pairs of stockings and a pair of summer shoes on sale. She gives me two shillings to have tea and a bun for my birthday. She gets on the bus to go back up O'Connell Street too fat and lazy to walk. Fat and lazy, no son of her own, and still she buys me the clothes for my new job.\nI turn toward Arthur's Quay with the package of new clothes under my arm and I have to stand at the edge of the River Shannon so that the whole world won't see the tears of a man the day he's fourteen.\nMonday morning I'm up early to wash my face and flatten my hair with water and spit. The Abbot sees me in my new clothes. Jaysus, he says, is it gettin' married you are? and goes back to sleep.\nMrs. O'Connell, the fat woman, says, Well, well, aren't we the height of fashion, and the thin one, Miss Barry, says, Did you rob a bank on the weekend? and there's a great laugh from the telegram boys sitting on the bench along the wall.\nI'm told to sit at the end of the bench and wait for my turn to go out with telegrams. Some telegram boys in uniforms are the permanent ones who took the exam. They can stay in the post office forever if they like, take the next exam for postman and then the one for clerk that lets them work inside selling stamps and money orders behind the counter downstairs. The post office gives permanent boys big waterproof capes for the bad weather and they get two weeks holiday every year. Everyone says these are good jobs, steady and pensionable and respectable, and if you get a job like this you never have to worry again in your whole life, so you don't.\nTemporary telegram boys are not allowed to stay in the job beyond the age of sixteen. There are no uniforms, no holidays, the pay is less, and if you stay out sick a day you can be fired. No excuses. There are no waterproof capes. Bring your own raincoat or dodge the raindrops.\nMrs. O'Connell calls me to her desk to give me a black leather belt and pouch. She says there's a great shortage of bicycles so I'll have to walk my first batch of telegrams. I'm to go to the farthest address\nfirst, work my way back, and don't take all day. She's long enough in the post office to know how long it takes to deliver six telegrams even by foot. I'm not to be stopping in pubs or bookies or even home for a cup of tea and if I do I'll be found out. I'm not to be stopping in chapels to say a prayer. If I have to pray do it on the hoof or on the bicycle. If it rains pay no attention. Deliver the telegrams and don't be a sissy.\nOne telegram is addressed to Mrs. Clohessy of Arthur's Quay and that couldn't be anyone but Paddy's mother.\nIs that you, Frankie McCourt? she says. God, I wouldn't know you you're that big. Come in, will you.\nShe's wearing a bright frock with flowers all over and shiny new shoes. There are two children on the floor playing with a toy train. On the table there is a teapot, cups with saucers, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, butter, jam. There are two beds over by the window where there were none before. The big bed in the corner is empty and she must know what I'm wondering. He's gone, she says, but he's not dead. Gone t' England with Paddy. Have a cup o' tay an' a bit o' bread. You need it, God help us. You look like one left over from the Famine itself. Ate that bread an' jam an' build yourself up. Paddy always talked about you and Dennis, my poor husband that was in the bed, never got over the day your mother came an' sang the song about the Kerry dancing. He's over in England now making sandwiches in a canteen and sending me a few bob every week. You'd wonder what the English are thinking about when they take a man that has the consumption and give him a job making sandwiches. Paddy has a grand job in a pub in Cricklewood, which is in England. Dennis would still be here if it wasn't for Paddy climbin' the wall for the tongue.\nTongue?\nDennis had the craving, so he did, for a nice sheep's head with a bit of cabbage and a spud so up with me to Barry the butcher with the last few shillings I had. I boiled that head an' sick an' all as he was Dennis couldn't wait for it to be done. He was a demon there in the bed callin' for the head an' when I gave it to him on the plate he was delighted with himself suckin' the marrow outa every inch of that head. Then he finishes an' he says, Mary, where is the tongue?\nWhat tongue? says I.\nThe tongue of this sheep. Every sheep is born with a tongue that lets him go ba ba ba and there's a great lack of tongue in this head. Go up to Barry the butcher and demand it.\nSo up with me to Barry the butcher and he said, That bloody sheep came in here bleatin'an'cryin'so much we cut the tongue from her and thrun it to the dog who gobbled it up and ever since ba bas like a sheep and if he doesn't quit I'll cut his tongue and throw it to the cat.\nBack I go to Dennis and he gets frantic in the bed. I want that tongue, he says. All the nourishment is in the tongue. And what do you think happens next but my Paddy, that was your friend, goes up to Barry the butcher after dark, climbs the wall, cuts the tongue of a sheep's head that's on a hook on the wall and brings it back to his poor father in the bed. Of course I have to boil that tongue with salt galore and Dennis, God love him, ates it, lies back in the bed a minute, throws back the blanket and stands out on his two feet announcing to the world that consumption or no consumption, he's not going to die in that bed, if he's going to die at all it might as well be under a German bomb with him\nmaking a few pounds for his family instead of whining in the bed there beyond.\nShe shows me a letter from Paddy. He's working in his uncle Anthony's pub twelve hours a day, twenty-five shillings a week and every day soup and a sandwich. He's delighted when the Germans come over with the bombs so that he can sleep while the pub is closed. At night he sleeps on the floor of the hallway upstairs. He will send his mother two pounds every month and he's saving the rest to bring her and the family to England where they'll be much better off in one room in Cricklewood than ten rooms in Arthur's Quay. She'll be able to get a job no bother. You'd have to be a sad case not to be able to get a job in a country that's at war especially with Yanks pouring in and spending money right and left. Paddy himself is planning to get a job in the middle of London where Yanks leave tips big enough to feed an Irish family of six for a week.\nMrs. Clohessy says, We have enough money for food and shoes at last, thanks be to God and His Blessed Mother. You'll never guess who Paddy met over there in England fourteen years of age an' workin' like a man. Brendan Kiely, the one ye used to call Question. Workin' he is an' savin' so he can go an' join the Mounties an' ride all over Canada like Nelson Eddy singin' I'll be callin' you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. If it wasn't for Hitler we'd all be dead an' isn't that a terrible thing to say. And how's your poor mother, Frankie?\nShe's grand, Mrs. Clohessy.\nNo, she's not. I seen her in the Dispensary and she looks worse than my Dennis did in the bed. You have to mind your poor mother. You look desperate too, Frankie, with them two red eyes starin' outa your head. Here's a little tip for you. Thruppence. Buy yourself a sweet.\nI will, Mrs. Clohessy.\nDo.\n***\nAt the end of the week Mrs. O'Connell hands me the first wages of\nmy life, a pound, my first pound. I run down the stairs and up to O'Connell Street, the main street, where the lights are on and people are going home from work, people like me with wages in their pockets. I want them to know I'm like them, I'm a man, I have a pound. I walk up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and hope they'll notice me. They don't. I want to wave my pound note at the world so they'll say, There he goes, Frankie McCourt the workingman, with a pound in his pocket.\nIt's Friday night and I can do anything I like. I can have fish and chips and go to the Lyric Cinema. No, no more Lyric. I don't have to sit up in the gods anymore with people all around me cheering on the Indians killing General Custer and the Africans chasing Tarzan all over the jungle. I can go to the Savoy Cinema now, pay sixpence for a seat down front where there's a better class of people eating boxes of chocolates and covering their mouths when they laugh. After the film I can have tea and buns in the restaurant upstairs.\nMichael is across the street calling me. He's hungry and wonders if there's any chance he could go to The Abbot's for a bit of bread and stay there for the night instead of going all the way to Laman Griffin's. I tell him he doesn't have to worry about a bit of bread. We'll go to the Coliseum Caf\u00e9 and have fish and chips, all he wants, lemonade galore, and then we'll go to see Yankee Doodle Dandy with James Cagney and eat two big bars of chocolate. After the film we have tea and buns and we sing\nand dance like Cagney all the way to The Abbot's. Michael says it must be great to be in America where people have nothing else to do but sing and dance. He's half asleep but he says he's going there some day to sing and dance and would I help him go and when he's asleep I start thinking about America and how I have to save money for my fare instead of squandering it on fish and chips and tea and buns. I'll have to save a few shillings from my pound because if I don't I'll be in Limerick forever. I'm fourteen now and if I save something every week surely I should be able to go to America by the time I'm twenty. There are telegrams for offices, shops, factories where there's no hope of a tip. Clerks take the telegrams without a look at you or a thank you. There are telegrams for the respectable people with maids along the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road where there's no hope of a tip. Maids are like clerks, they don't look at you or say thank you. There are telegrams for the houses of priests and nuns and they have maids, too, even if they say poverty is noble. If you waited for tips from priests or nuns you'd die on their doorstep.\nThere are telegrams for people miles outside the city, farmers with muddy yards and dogs who want to eat your legs. There are telegrams for rich people in big houses with gate lodges and miles of land surrounded by walls. The gatekeeper waves you in and you have to cycle for miles up long drives past lawns, flower beds, fountains to reach the big house. If the weather is fine people are playing croquet, the Protestant game, or strolling around, talking and laughing, all decked out in flowery dresses and blazers with crests and golden buttons and you'd never know there was a war on. There are Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked outside the great front door where a maid tells you go around to the servants' entrance don't you know any better.\nPeople in the big houses have English accents and they don't tip telegram boys.\nThe best people for tips are widows, Protestant ministers' wives and the poor in general. Widows know when the telegram money order is due from the English government and they wait by the window. You have to be careful if they ask you in for a cup of tea because one of the temporary boys, Scrawby Luby, said an old widow of thirty-five had him in for tea and tried to take down his pants and he had to run out of the house though he was really tempted and had to go to confession the next Saturday. He said it was very awkward hopping up on the bike with his thing sticking out but if you cycle very fast and think of the sufferings of the Virgin Mary you'll go soft in no time.\nProtestant ministers' wives would never carry on like Scrawby Luby's old widow unless they're widows themselves. Christy Wallace, who is a permanent telegram boy and ready to be a postman any day, says Protestants don't care what they do even if they're ministers' wives. They're doomed anyway, so what does it matter if they have a bit of a romp with a telegram boy. All the telegram boys like Protestant ministers' wives. They might have maids but they answer doors themselves and say, One moment, please, and give you sixpence. I'd like to talk to them and ask them how it feels to be doomed but they might get offended and take back the sixpence.\nThe Irishmen working in England send their telegram money orders on Friday nights and all day Saturday and that's when we get the good tips. The minute we deliver one batch we're out with another.\nThe worst lanes are in the Irishtown, off High Street or Mungret Street, worse than Roden Lane or O'Keeffe's Lane or any lane I lived in. There are lanes with channels running down the middle. Mothers stand at doors and yell gardyloo when they empty their slop buckets. Children make paper boats or float matchboxes with little sails on the greasy water.\nWhen you ride into a lane the children call out, Here's the telegram boy, here's the telegram boy. They run to you and the women wait at the door. If you give a small child a telegram for his mother he's the hero of the family. Little girls know they're supposed to wait till the boys get their chance though they can get the telegram if they have no brothers. Women at the door will call to you that they have no money now but if you're in this lane tomorrow knock on the door for your tip, God bless you an' all belongin' to you.\nMrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry at the post office tell us every day our job is to deliver telegrams and nothing else. We are not to be doing things for people, going to the shop for groceries or any other kind of message. They don't care if people are dying in the bed. They don't care if people are legless, lunatic or crawling on the floor. We are to deliver the telegram and that's all. Mrs. O'Connell says, I know everything ye do, everything, for the people of Limerick have their eye on ye and there are reports which I have here in my drawers.\nA fine place to keep reports, says Toby Mackey under his breath.\nBut Mrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry don't know what it's like in the lane when you knock on a door and someone says come in and you go in and there's no light and there's a pile of rags on a bed in a corner the pile saying who is it and you say telegram and the pile of rags tells you would you ever go to the shop for me I'm starving with the hunger and I'd give me two eyes for a cup of tea and what are you going to do say I'm busy and ride off on your bike and leave the pile of rags there with a telegram money order that's pure useless because the pile of rags is helpless to get out of the bed to go to the post office to cash the bloody money order.\nWhat are you supposed to do?\nYou're told never never go to the post office to cash one of those money orders for anyone or you'll lose your job forever. But what are you supposed to do when an old man that was in the Boer War hundreds of years ago says his legs are gone and he'd be forever grateful if you'd go to Paddy Considine in the post office and tell him the situation and Paddy will surely cash the money order and keep two shillings for yourself grand boy that you are. Paddy Considine says no bother but don't tell anyone or I'd be out on my arse and so would you, son. The old man from the Boer War says he knows you have telegrams to deliver now but would you ever come back tonight and maybe go to the shop for him for he doesn't have a thing in the house and he's freezing on top of it. He sits in an old armchair in the corner covered with bits of blankets and a bucket behind the chair that stinks enough to make you sick and when you look at that old man in the dark corner you want to get a hose with hot water and strip him and wash him down and give him a big feed of rashers and eggs and mashed potatoes with loads of butter salt and onions.\nI want to take the man from the Boer War and the pile of rags in the bed and put them in a big sunny house in the country with birds chirping away outside the window and a stream gurgling.\nMrs. Spillane in Pump Lane off Carey's Road has two crippled twin children with big blond heads, small bodies, and bits of legs that dangle\nover the edges of the chairs. They look into the fire all day and say, Where's Daddy? They speak English like everybody else but they babble away to one another in a language they made up, Hung sup tea tea sup hung. Mrs. Spillane says that means, When are we getting our supper? She tells me she's lucky if her husband sends four pounds a month and she's beside herself with the abuse she gets from the Dispensary over him being in England. The children are only four and they're very bright even if they can't walk or take care of themselves. If they could walk, if they were any way normal, she'd pack up and move to England out of this godforsaken country that fought so long for freedom and look at the state of us, De Valera in his mansion above in Dublin the dirty oul' bastard and the rest of the politicians that can all go to hell, God forgive me. The priests can go to hell too and I won't ask God to forgive me for saying the likes of that. There they are, the priests and the nuns telling us Jesus was poor and 'tis no shame, lorries driving up to their houses with crates and barrels of whiskey and wine, eggs galore and legs of ham and they telling us what we should give up for Lent. Lent, my arse. What are we to give up when we have Lent all year long?\nI want to take Mrs. Spillane and her two blond crippled children and put them in that house in the country with the pile of rags and the man from the Boer War and wash everyone and let them all sit in the sun with the birds singing and the streams gurgling.\nI can't leave the pile of rags alone with a useless money order because the pile is an old woman, Mrs. Gertrude Daly, all twisted with every class of disease you can get in a Limerick lane, arthritis, rheumatism, falling hair, a nostril half gone from her jabbing at it with her finger, and you wonder what kind of a world is it when this old woman sits up from the rags and smiles at you with teeth that gleam white in the dark, her own teeth and perfect.\nThat's right, she says, me own teeth, and when I rot in the grave they'll find me teeth a hundred years from now all white an' shiny an' I'll be declared a saint.\nThe telegram money order, three pounds, is from her son. It has a message, Happy Birthday, Mammy, Your fond son, Teddy. She says, A wonder he can spare it, the little shit, trottin' around with every tart in Piccadilly. She asks if I'd ever do her a favor and cash the money order and get her a little Baby Powers whiskey at the pub, a loaf of bread, a pound of lard, seven potatoes, one for each day of the week. Would I boil\na potato for\nbread, bring\nO'Connor the\nsome soap so\ngrateful and\nmy troubles.\nher, mash it up with a lump of lard, give her a cut of\nher a drop of water to go with the whiskey? Would I go to chemist for ointment for her sores and while I'm at it bring she can give her body a good scrub and she'll be forever\nsay a prayer for me and here's a couple of shillings for all\nAh, no thanks, ma'am.\nTake the money. Little tip. You did me great favors.\nI couldn't, ma'am, the way you are.\nTake the money or I'll tell the post office you're not to deliver\nmy telegram anymore.\nOh, all right, ma'am. Thanks very much.\nGood night, son. Be good to your mother.\nGood night, Mrs. Daly.\nSchool starts in September and some days Michael stops at The\nAbbot's before the walk home to Laman Griffin's. On rainy days he says,\nCan I stay here tonight? and soon he doesn't want to go back to Laman Griffin's at all. He's worn out and hungry with two miles out and two miles back.\nWhen Mam comes looking for him I don't know what to say to her. I don't know how to look at her and I keep my eyes off to one side. She says, How's the job? as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's and I say, Grand, as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's. If the rain is too heavy for her to go home she stays in the small room upstairs with Alphie. She goes back to Laman's the next day but Michael stays and soon she's moving in herself bit by bit till she stops going to Laman's altogether.\nThe Abbot pays the rent every week. Mam gets the relief and the food dockets till someone informs on her and she's cut off from the Dispensary. She's told that if her son is bringing in a pound a week that's more than some families get on the dole and she should be grateful he has a job. Now I have to hand over my wages. Mam says, A pound? Is that all you get for riding around in all kinds of weather? This would be four dollars in America. Four dollars. And you couldn't feed a cat for four dollars in New York. If you were delivering telegrams for Western Union in New York you'd be earning twenty-five dollars a week and living in luxury. She always translates Irish money into American so that she won't forget and tries to convince everyone times were better over there. Some weeks she lets me keep two shillings but if I go to a film or buy a secondhand book there's nothing left, I won't be able to save for my fare, and I'll be stuck in Limerick till I'm an old man of twenty-five.\nMalachy writes from Dublin to say he's fed up and doesn't want to spend the rest of his life blowing a trumpet in the army band. He's home in a week and complains when he has to share the big bed with Michael, Alphie and me. He had his own army cot up there in Dublin with sheets and blankets and a pillow. Now he's back to overcoats and a bolster that sends up a cloud of feathers when you touch it. Mam says, Pity about you. I'm sorry for your troubles. The Abbot has his own bed, and my mother has the small room. We're all together again, no Laman tormenting us. We make tea and fried bread and sit on the kitchen floor. The Abbot says you're not supposed to be sitting on kitchen floors, what are tables and chairs for? He tells Mam that Frankie is not right in the head and Mam says we'll all catch our death from the damp of the floor. We sit on the floor and sing and Mam and The Abbot sit on chairs. She sings \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" and the Abbot sings \"The Road to Rasheen\" and we still don't know what his song is about. We sit on the floor and tell stories about things that happened, things that never happened and things that will happen when we all go to America.\nThere are slow days at the post office and we sit on the bench and talk. We can talk but we are not to laugh. Miss Barry says we should be grateful we're getting paid to sit there, bunch of idlers and streetboys that we are, and that there is to be no laughing. Getting paid for sitting and chatting is no laughing matter and the first titter out of any of us and out we go till we come to our senses and if the tittering continues we'll be reported to the proper authorities.\nThe boys talk about her under their breath. Toby Mackey says, What that oul' bitch needs is a good rub o' the relic, a good rub o' the brush. Her mother was a streetwalking flaghopper and her father escaped from a lunatic asylum with bunions on his balls and warts on his wank.\nThere is laughing along the bench and Miss Barry calls to us, I warned ye against the laughing. Mackey, what is it you're prattling about over there?\nI said we'd all be better off out in the fresh air on this fine day delivering telegrams, Miss Barry.\nI'm sure you did, Mackey. Your mouth is a lavatory. Did you hear\nme?\nI did, Miss Barry.\nYou have been heard on the stairs, Mackey. Yes, Miss Barry.\nShut up, Mackey.\nI will, Miss Barry.\nNot another word, Mackey.\nNo, Miss Barry.\nI said shut up, Mackey.\nAll right, Miss Barry.\nThat's the end of it, Mackey. Don't try me. I won't, Miss Barry.\nMother o' God give me patience.\nYes, Miss Barry.\nTake the last word, Mackey. Take it, take it, take it.\nI will, Miss Barry.\nToby Mackey is a temporary telegram boy like me. He saw a film\ncalled The Front Page and now he wants to go to America some day and be a tough newspaper reporter with a hat and a cigarette. He keeps a notebook in his pocket because a good reporter has to write down what happens. Facts. He has to write down facts not a lot of bloody poetry, which is all you hear in Limerick with men in pubs going on about our great sufferings under the English. Facts, Frankie. He writes down the number of telegrams he delivers and how far he travels. We sit on the bench making sure we don't laugh and he tells me that if we deliver forty telegrams a day that's two hundred a week and that's ten thousand a year and twenty thousand in our two years at the job. If we cycle one hundred and twenty-five miles in a week that's thirteen thousand miles in two years and that's halfway around the world, Frankie, and no wonder there isn't a scrap of flesh on our arses.\nToby says nobody knows Limerick like the telegram boy. We know every avenue, road, street, terrace, mews, place, close, lane. Jasus, says Toby, there isn't a door in Limerick we don't know. We knock on all kinds of doors, iron, oak, plywood. Twenty thousand doors, Frankie. We rap, kick, push. We ring and buzz bells. We shout and whistle, Telegram boy, telegram boy. We drop telegrams in letter boxes, shove them under doors, throw them over the transom. We climb in windows where people are bedridden. We fight off every dog who wants to turn us into dinner. You never know what's going to happen when you hand people their telegrams. They laugh and sing and dance and cry and scream and fall down in a weakness and you wonder if they'll wake up at all and give you the tip. It's not a bit like delivering telegrams in America where Mickey Rooney rides around in a film called The Human Comedy and people are pleasant and falling over themselves to give you a tip, inviting you in, giving you a cup of tea and a bun.\nToby Mackey says he has facts galore in his notebook and he doesn't give a fiddler's fart about anything and that's the way I'd like to be myself.\nMrs. O'Connell knows I like the country telegrams and if a day is sunny she gives me a batch of ten that will keep me away all morning and I don't have to return till after the dinner hour at noon. There are fine autumn days when the Shannon sparkles and the fields are green and glinting with silver morning dew. Smoke blows across fields and there's the sweet smell of turf fires. Cows and sheep graze in the fields and I wonder if these are the beasts the priest was talking about. I wouldn't be surprised because there's no end to the bulls climbing on cows, rams on sheep, stallions on mares, and they all have such big things it makes me break out in a sweat to look at them and I feel sorry for all the female creatures in the world who have to suffer like that though I wouldn't mind being a bull myself because they can do what they like and it's never a sin for an animal. I wouldn't mind going at myself here but you never know when a farmer might come along the road driving cows and sheep to a fair or to another field raising his stick and bidding you, Good day, young fella, grand morning, thank God and His Blessed Mother. A farmer that religious might be offended if he saw you breaking the Sixth Commandment forninst his field. Horses like to stick their heads over fences and hedges to see what's passing by and I stop and talk to them because they have big eyes and long noses that show how intelligent they are. Sometimes two birds will be singing to each other across a field and I have to stop and listen to them and if I stay long enough more birds will join till every tree and bush is alive with birdsong. If there's a stream gurgling under a bridge on the road, birds singing and cows mooing and lambs baaing, that's better than any band in a film. The smell of dinner bacon and cabbage wafting from a farmhouse makes me so weak with the hunger I climb into a field and stuff myself with blackberries for half an hour. I stick my face into the stream and drink icy water that's better than the lemonade in any fish and chip shop.\nWhen I'm finished delivering the telegrams there's enough time to go to the ancient monastery graveyard where my mother's relations are buried, the Guilfoyles and the Sheehans, where my mother wants to be buried. I can see from here the high ruins of Carrigogunnell Castle and there's plenty of time to cycle there, sit up on the highest wall, look at the Shannon flowing out to the Atlantic on its way to America and dream of the day I'll be sailing off myself.\nThe boys at the post office tell me I'm lucky to get the Carmody family telegram, a shilling tip, one of the biggest tips you'll ever get in Limerick. So why am I getting it? I'm the junior boy. They say, Well, sometimes Theresa Carmody answers the door. She has the consumption and they're afraid of catching it from her. She's seventeen, in and out of the sanatorium, and she'll never see eighteen. The boys at the post office say sick people like Theresa know there's little time left and that makes them mad for love and romance and everything. Everything. That's what the consumption does to you, say the boys at the post office.\nI cycle through wet November streets thinking of that shilling tip, and as I turn into the Carmody street the bicycle slides out from under me and I skid along the ground scraping my face and tearing open the back of my hand. Theresa Carmody opens the door. She has red hair. She had green eyes like the fields beyond Limerick. Her cheeks are bright pink and her skin is a fierce white. She says, Oh, you're all wet and bleeding.\nI skidded on my bike.\nCome in and I'll put something on your cuts.\nI wonder, Should I go in? I might get the consumption and that will be the end of me. I want to be alive when I'm fifteen and I want the shilling tip. Come in. You'll perish standing there.\nShe puts on the kettle for the tea. Then she dabs iodine on my cuts and I try to be a man and not whimper. She says, Oh, you're a great bit of a man. Go into the parlor and dry yourself before the fire. Look, why don't you take off your pants and dry them on the screen of the fire?\nAh, no.\nAh, do.\nI will.\nI drape my pants over the screen. I sit there watching the steam\nrise and I watch myself rise and I worry she might come in and see me in my excitement.\nThere she is with a plate of bread and jam and two cups of tea. Lord, she says, you might be a scrawny bit of a fellow but that's a fine boyo you have there.\nShe puts the plate and the cups on a table by the fire and there they stay. With her thumb and forefinger she takes the tip of my excitement and leads me across the room to a green sofa against the wall and all the time my head is filled with sin and iodine and fear of consumption and the shilling tip and her green eyes and she's on the sofa don't stop or I'll die and she's crying and I'm crying for I don't know what's happening to me if I'm killing myself catching consumption from her mouth I'm riding to heaven I'm falling off a cliff and if this is a sin I don't give a fiddler's fart.\nWe take our ease on the sofa a while till she says, Don't you have more telegrams to deliver? and when we sit up she gives a little cry, Oh, I'm bleeding.\nWhat's up with you?\nI think it's because it's the first time.\nI tell her, Wait a minute. I bring the bottle from the kitchen and\nsplash the iodine on her injury. She leaps from the sofa, dances around the parlor like a wild one and runs into the kitchen to douse herself with water. After she dries herself she says, Lord, you're very innocent. You're not supposed to be pouring iodine on girls like that.\nI thought you were cut.\nFor weeks after that I deliver the telegram. Sometimes we have the excitement on the sofa but there are other days she has the cough and you can see the weakness on her. She never tells me she has the weakness. She never tells me she has the consumption. The boys at the post office say I must have been having a great time with the shilling tip and Theresa Carmody. I never tell them I stopped taking the shilling tip. I never tell them about the green sofa and the excitement. I never tell them of the pain that comes when she opens the door and I can see the weakness on her and all I want to do then is make tea for her and sit with my arms around her on the green sofa.\nOne Saturday I'm told to deliver the telegram to Theresa's mother at her job in Woolworth's. I try to be casual. Mrs. Carmody, I always deliver the telegram to your, I think your daughter, Theresa?\nYes, she's in the hospital.\nIs she in the sanatorium?\nI said she's in the hospital.\nShe's like everyone else in Limerick, ashamed of the TB, and she\ndoesn't give me a shilling or any kind of tip. I cycle out to the\nsanatorium to see Theresa. They say you have to be a relation and you have to be adult. I tell them I'm her cousin and I'll be fifteen in August. They tell me go away. I cycle to the Franciscan church to pray for Theresa. St. Francis, would you please talk to God. Tell Him it wasn't Theresa's fault. I could have refused that telegram Saturday after Saturday. Tell God Theresa was not responsible for the excitement on the sofa because that's what the consumption does to you. It doesn't matter anyway, St. Francis, because I love Theresa. I love her as much as you love any bird or beast or fish and will you tell God take the consumption away and I promise I'll never go near her again.\nThe next Saturday they give me the Carmody telegram. From halfway up the street I can see the blinds are drawn. I can see the black crepe wreath on the door. I can see the white purple-lined mourning card. I can see beyond the door and walls where Theresa and I tumbled naked and wild on the green sofa and I know now she is in hell and all because of me.\nI slip the telegram under the door and cycle back down to the Franciscan church to beg for the repose of Theresa's soul. I pray to every statue, to the stained glass windows, the Stations of the Cross. I swear I'll lead a life of faith, hope and charity, poverty, chastity and obedience.\nNext day, Sunday, I go to four Masses. I do the Stations of the Cross three times. I say rosaries all day. I go without food and drink and wherever I find a quiet place I cry and beg God and the Virgin Mary to have mercy on the soul of Theresa Carmody.\nOn Monday I follow the funeral to the graveyard on my post office bicycle. I stand behind a tree a distance from the grave. Mrs. Carmody weeps and moans. Mr. Carmody snuffles and looks puzzled. The priest recites the Latin prayers and sprinkles the coffin with holy water.\nI want to go to the priest, to Mr. and Mrs. Carmody. I want to tell them how I'm the one who sent Theresa to hell. They can do whatever they like with me. Abuse me. Revile me. Throw grave dirt at me. But I stay behind the tree till the mourners leave and the grave diggers fill in the grave.\nFrost is already whitening the fresh earth on the grave and I think of Theresa cold in the coffin, the red hair, the green eyes. I can't understand the feelings going through me but I know that with all the people who died in my family and all the people who died in the lanes around me and all the people who left I never had a pain like this in my heart and I hope I never will again.\nIt's getting dark. I walk my bicycle out of the graveyard. I have telegrams to deliver.\nXVI\nMrs. O'Connell gives me telegrams to deliver to Mr. Harrington, the Englishman with the dead wife that was born and bred in Limerick. The boys at the post office say sympathy telegrams are a waste of time. People just cry and moan with the grief and they think they're excused from the tip. They'll ask you if you'd like to come in for a look at the departed and a prayer by the bed. That wouldn't be so bad if they offered you a drop of sherry and a ham sandwich. Oh, no, they're happy to get your prayer but you're only a telegram boy and you're lucky if you get a\ndry biscuit. Older boys at the post office say you have to play your cards right to get the grief tip. If you're asked in to say a prayer you have to kneel by the corpse, give a powerful sigh, bless yourself, drop your forehead to the bedclothes so they won't see your face, let your shoulders shake like one collapsing with sorrow, hold on to the bed with your two hands as if they're going to have to tear you away to deliver the rest of your telegrams, make sure your cheeks are glinting with tears or the spit you dabbed on, and if you don't get a tip after all that push the next batch of telegrams under the door or fire them over the transom and leave them to their grief.\nThis isn't my first time delivering telegrams to the Harrington house. Mr. Harrington is always away on business for the insurance company and Mrs. Harrington is generous with the tip. But she's gone and Mr. Harrington answers the doorbell. His eyes are red and he sniffles. He says, Are you Irish?\nIrish? What else would I be standing there on his doorstep in Limerick with a batch of telegrams in my hand? I am, sir. He says, Come in. Put the telegrams on the hall stand. He shuts the hall door, locks it, puts the key in his pocket and I think, Aren't Englishmen very peculiar.\nYou'll want to see her, of course. You'll want to see what you people have done to her with your damn tuberculosis. Race of ghouls. Follow me.\nHe leads me first to the kitchen where he picks up a plate of ham sandwiches and two bottles, and then upstairs. Mrs. Harrington looks lovely in the bed, blond, pink, peaceful.\nThis is my wife. She may be Irish but she doesn't look it, thank God. Like you. Irish. You'll need a drink, of course. You Irish quaff at every turn. Barely weaned before you clamor for the whiskey bottle, the pint of stout. You'll have what, whiskey, sherry?\nAh, a lemonade will be lovely.\nI am mourning my wife not celebrating the bloody citrus. You'll have a sherry. Swill from bloody Catholic fascist Spain.\nI gulp the sherry. He refills my glass and goes to refill his own with whiskey. Damn. Whiskey all gone. Stay here. Do you hear me? I'm going to the pub for another bottle of whiskey. Stay till I come back. Don't move.\nI'm confused, dizzy from the sherry. I don't know what you're supposed to do with grieving Englishmen. Mrs. Harrington, you look lovely in the bed. But you're a Protestant, already doomed, in hell, like Theresa. Priest said, Outside the Church there is no salvation. Wait, I might be able to save your soul. Baptize you Catholic. Make up for what I did to Theresa. I'll get some water. Oh, God, the door is locked. Why? Maybe you're not dead at all? Watching me. Are you dead, Mrs. Harrington? I'm not afraid. Your face is icy. Oh, you're dead all right. I'll baptize you with sherry from bloody Catholic fascist Spain. I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son, the- What the bloody hell are you doing? Get off my wife, you wretched Papist twit. What primitive Paddy ritual is this? Did you touch her? Did you? I'll wring your scrawny neck.\nI - I, -\nOi, Oi, speak English, you scrap.\nI was just, a little sherry to get her into heaven.\nHeaven? We had heaven, Ann, I, our daughter, Emily. You'll never lay your pink piggy eyes on her. Oh, Christ, I can't stand it. Here, more sherry.\nAh, no, thanks.\nAh, no thanks. That puny Celtic whine. You people love your alcohol. Helps you crawl and whine better. Of course you want food. You have the collapsed look of a starving Paddy. Here. Ham. Eat.\nAh, no thanks.\nAh, no thanks. Say that again and I'll ram the ham up your arse. He waves a ham sandwich at me, with the heel of his hand pushes it\ninto my mouth.\nHe collapses into a chair. Oh, God, God, what am I to do? Must rest\na moment.\nMy stomach heaves. I rush to the window, stick my head out and\nthrow up. He leaps from the chair and charges me.\nYou, you, God blast you to hell, you vomited on my wife's rosebush. He lunges at me, misses, falls to the floor. I climb out the\nwindow, hang on to the ledge. He's at the window, grabbing at my hands. I let go, drop to the rosebush, into the ham sandwich and sherry I've just thrown up. I'm pricked by rose thorns, stung, my ankle is twisted. He's at the window, barking, Come back here, you Irish runt. He'll report me to the post office. He hits me in the back with the whiskey bottle, pleads, Will you not watch one hour with me?\nHe pelts me with sherry glasses, whiskey glasses, assorted ham sandwiches, items from his wife's dressing table, powders, creams, brushes.\nI climb on my bike and wobble through the streets of Limerick, dizzy with sherry and pain. Mrs. O'Connell attacks me, Seven telegrams, one address, and you're gone all day.\nI was, I was,\nYou was. You was. Drunk is what you was. Drunk is what you are. Reeking. Oh, we heard. That nice man rang, Mr. Harrington, lovely Englishman that sounds like James Mason. Lets you in to say a prayer for his poor wife and next thing you're out the window with the sherry and the ham. Your poor mother. What she brought into the world.\nHe made me eat the ham, drink the sherry.\nMade you? Jesus, that's a good one. Made you. Mr. Harrington is a refined Englishman and there is no reason for him to lie and we don't want your kind in this post office, people that can't keep their hands off the ham and sherry, so hand in your telegram pouch and bicycle for your days are done in this post office.\nBut I need the job. I have to save and go to America.\nAmerica. Sad day when America lets in the likes of you.\nI hobble through the streets of Limerick. I'd like to go back and\nthrow a brick through Mr. Harrington's window. No. Respect for the dead. I'll go across the Sarsfield Bridge and out the riverbank where I can lie down somewhere in the bushes. I don't know how I can go home and tell my mother I lost my job. Have to go home. Have to tell her. Can't stay out the riverbank all night. She'd be frantic.\nMam begs the post office to take me back. They say no. They never heard the likes. Telegram boy mauling corpse. Telegram boy fleeing scene with ham and sherry. He will never set foot in the post office again. No.\nShe gets a letter from the parish priest. Take the boy back, says the parish priest. Oh, yes, Father, indeed, says the post office. They'll\nlet me stay till my sixteenth birthday, not a minute longer. Besides, says Mrs. O'Connell, when you think of what the English did to us for eight hundred years that man had no right to complain over a little ham and sherry. Compare a little ham and sherry to the Great Famine and where are you? If my poor husband was alive and I told him what you did he'd say you struck a blow, Frank McCourt, struck a blow.\nEvery Saturday morning I swear I'll go to confession and tell the priest of my impure acts at home, on lonely boreens around Limerick with cows and sheep gawking, on the heights of Carrigogunnell with the world looking up.\nI'll tell him about Theresa Carmody and how I sent her to hell, and that will be the end of me, driven from the Church.\nTheresa is a torment to me. Every time I deliver a telegram to her street, every time I pass the graveyard I feel the sin growing in me like an abscess and if I don't go to confession soon I'll be nothing but an abscess riding around on a bicycle with people pointing and telling each other, There he is, there's Frankie McCourt, the dirty thing that sent Theresa Carmody to hell.\nI look at people going to Communion on Sundays, everyone in a state of grace, returning to their seats with God in their mouths, peaceful, easy, ready to die at any moment and go straight to heaven or go home to their rashers and eggs without a worry in the world.\nI'm worn out from being the worst sinner in Limerick. I want to get rid of this sin and have rashers and eggs and no guilt, no torment. I want to be ordinary.\nThe priests tell us all the time that God's mercy is infinite but how can any priest give absolution to someone like me who delivers telegrams and winds up in a state of excitement on a green sofa with a girl dying of the galloping consumption.\nI cycle all around Limerick with telegrams and stop at every church. I ride from Redemptorists to Jesuits to Augustinians to Dominicans to Franciscans. I kneel before the statue of St. Francis of Assisi and beg him to help me but I think he's too disgusted with me. I kneel with people in the pews next to confessionals but when my turn comes I can't breathe, my heart pounds, my forehead turns cold and clammy and I run from the church.\nI swear I'll go to confession at Christmas. I can't. Easter. I can't. Weeks and months pass and it's a year since Theresa died. I'll go on her anniversary but I can't. I'm fifteen now and I pass churches without stopping. I'll have to wait till I go to America where there are priests like Bing Crosby in Going My Way who won't kick me out of the confessional like Limerick priests.\nI still have the sin in me, the abscess, and I hope it doesn't kill me entirely before I see the American priest.\nThere's a telegram for an old woman, Mrs. Brigid Finucane. She says, How old are you, by?\nFifteen and a half, Mrs. Finucane.\nYoung enough to make a fool of yourself and ould enough to know better. Are you shmart, by? Are you anyway intelligent?\nI can read and write, Mrs. Finucane.\nArrah, there are people above in the lunatic asylum can read and write. Can you write a letter?\nI can.\nShe wants me to write letters to her customers. If you need a suit or dress for your child you can go to her. She gives you a ticket to a shop and they give you the clothes. She gets a discount and charges you the full price and interest on top. You pay her back weekly. Some of her customers fall behind in their payments and they need threatening letters. She says, I'll give you threepence for every letter you write and another threepence if it brings a payment. If you want the job come here on Thursday and Friday nights, and bring your own paper and envelopes.\nI'm desperate for that job. I want to go to America. But I have no money for paper and envelopes. Next day I'm delivering a telegram to Woolworth's and there is the answer, a whole section packed with paper and envelopes. I have no money so I have to help myself. But how? Two dogs save the day for me, two dogs at the door of Woolworth's stuck together after the excitement. They yelp and run in circles. Customers and sales clerks giggle and pretend to be looking someplace else and while they're busy pretending I slip paper and envelopes under my sweater, out the door and off on my bike far from stuck dogs.\nMrs. Finucane looks suspicious. That's very fancy stationery you have there, by. Is that your mother's? You'll give that back when you get the money, won't you, by?\nOh, I will.\nFrom now on I'm never to come to her front door. There's a lane behind her house and I'm to come in the back door for fear someone might see me.\nIn a large ledger she gives me the names and addresses of six customers behind in their payments. Threaten 'em, by. Frighten the life out of 'em.\nMy first letter,\nDear Mrs. O'Brien,\nInasmuch as you have not seen fit to pay me what you owe me I may be forced to resort to legal action. There's your son, Michael, parading around the world in his new suit which I paid for while I myself have barely a crust to keep body and soul together. I am sure you don't want to languish in the dungeons of Limerick jail far from friends and family.\nI remain, yours in litigious anticipation, Mrs. Brigid Finucane She tells me, That's a powerful letter, by, better than anything you'd read in the Limerick Leader. That word, inasmuch, that's a holy terror of a word. What does it mean?\nI think it means this is your last chance.\nI write five more letters and she gives me money for stamps. On my way to the post office I think, Why should I squander money on stamps when I have two legs to deliver the letters myself in the dead of night? When you're poor a threatening letter is a threatening letter no matter how it comes in the door.\nI run through the lanes of Limerick shoving letters under doors, praying no one will see me.\nThe next week Mrs. Finucane is squealing with joy. Four of 'em paid. Oh, sit down now and write more, by. Put the fear of God in 'em.\nWeek after week my threatening letters grow sharper and sharper. I begin to throw in words I hardly understand myself.\nDear Mrs. O'Brien,\nInasmuch as you have not succumbed to the imminence of litigation in our previous epistle be advised that we are in consultation with our barrister above in Dublin.\nNext week Mrs. O'Brien pays. She came in tremblin' with tears in her eyes, by, and she promised she'd never miss another payment.\nOn Friday nights Mrs. Finucane sends me to a pub for a bottle of sherry. You're too young for sherry, by. You can make yourself a nice cup of tea but you have to use the tea leaves left over from this morning. No, you can't have a piece of bread with the prices they're charging. Bread is it? Next thing you'll be asking for an egg.\nShe rocks by the fire, sipping her sherry, counting the money in the purse on her lap, entering payments in her ledger before she locks everything in the trunk under her bed upstairs. After a few sherries she tells me what a lovely thing it is to have a little money so you can leave it to the Church for Masses to be said for the repose of your soul. It makes her so happy to think of priests saying Masses for her years and years after she's dead and buried.\nSometimes she falls asleep and if the purse drops to the floor I help myself to an extra few shillings for the overtime and the use of all the big new words. There will be less money for the priests and their Masses but how many Masses does a soul need and surely I'm entitled to a few pounds after the way the Church slammed doors in my face? They wouldn't let me be an altar boy, a secondary school pupil, a missionary with the White Fathers. I don't care. I have a post office savings account and if I keep writing successful threatening letters, helping myself to the odd few shillings from her purse and keeping the stamp money, I'll have my escape money to America. If my whole family dropped from the hunger I wouldn't touch this money in the post office.\nOften I have to write threatening letters to neighbors and friends of my mother and I worry they might discover me. They complain to Mam, That oul' bitch, Finucane, below in Irishtown, sent me a threatening letter. What kind of a demon outa hell would torment her own kind with a class of a letter that I can't make head nor tail of anyway with words never heard on land or sea. The person that would write that letter is worse than Judas or any informer for the English.\nMy mother says anyone that writes such letters should be boiled in oil and have his fingernails pulled out by blind people.\nI'm sorry for their troubles but there's no other way for me to save the money for America. I know that someday I'll be a rich Yank and send home hundreds of dollars and my family will never have to worry about threatening letters again.\n***\nSome of the temporary telegram boys are taking the permanent exam in August. Mrs. O'Connell says, You should take that exam, Frank McCourt. You have a bit of a brain in your head and you'd pass it no bother. You'd be a postman in no time and a great help to your poor mother.\nMam says I should take it, too, become a postman, save up, go to America and be a postman over there and wouldn't that be a lovely life.\nI'm delivering a telegram to South's pub on a Saturday and Uncle Pa Keating is sitting there, all black as usual. He says, Have a lemonade there, Frankie, or is it a pint you want now that you're near sixteen?\nLemonade, Uncle Pa, thanks.\nYou'll want your first pint the day you're sixteen, won't you? I will but my father won't be here to get it for me.\nDon't worry about that. I know 'tis not the same without your\nfather but I'll get you the first pint. 'Tis what I'd do if I had a son. Come here the night before you're sixteen.\nI will, Uncle Pa.\nI hear you're taking that exam for the post office?\nI am.\nWhy would you do a thing like that? 'Tis a good job and I'd be a\npostman in no time and it has the pension.\nAh, pension my arse. Sixteen years of age an' talking about the\npension. Is it coddin' me you are? Do you hear what I said, Frankie? Pension my arse. If you pass the exam you'll stay in the post office nice and secure the rest of your life. You'll marry a Brigid and have five little Catholics and grow little roses in your garden. You'll be dead in your head before you're thirty and dried in your ballocks the year before. Make up your own bloody mind and to hell with the safeshots and the begrudgers. Do you hear me, Frankie McCourt?\nI do, Uncle Pa. That's what Mr. O'Halloran said.\nWhat did he say?\nMake up your own mind.\nTrue for Mr. O'Halloran. 'Tis your life, make your own decisions\nand to hell with the begrudgers, Frankie. In the heel o' the hunt you'll be going to America anyway, won't you?\nI will, Uncle Pa.\nThe day of the exam I'm excused from work. There's a sign in an office window on O'Connell Street, SMART BOY WANTED, NEAT HANDWRITING, GOOD AT SUMS, APPLY HERE TO MANAGER, MR. MCCAFFREY, EASONS LTD.\nI stand outside the place of the exam, the house of the Limerick Protestant Young Men's Association. There are boys from all over Limerick climbing the steps to take the exam and a man at the door is handing them sheets of paper and pencils and barking at them to hurry up, hurry up. I look at the man at the door, I think of Uncle Pa Keating and what he said, I think of the sign in Easons' office, SMART BOY WANTED. I don't want to go in that door and pass that exam for if I do I'll be a permanent telegram boy with a uniform, then a postman, then a clerk selling stamps for the rest of my life. I'll be in Limerick forever, growing roses with my head dead and my ballocks all dried up.\nThe man at the door says, You, are you coming in here or are you goin' to stand there with your face hanging out?\nI want to say to the man, Kiss my arse, but I still have a few weeks left in the post office and he might report me. I shake my head and walk up the street where a smart boy is wanted.\nThe manager, Mr. McCaffrey, says, I would like to see a specimen of your handwriting, to see, in short, if you have a decent fist. Sit down there at that table. Write your name and address and write me a paragraph explaining why you came here for this job and how you propose to rise in the ranks of Eason and Son, Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assiduity where there is great opportunity in this company for a boy that will keep his eye on the guidon ahead and guard his flanks from the siren call of sin.\nI write,\nFrank McCourt,\n4 Little Barrington Street,\nLimerick City,\nCounty Limerick,\nIreland\nI am applying for this job so that I can rise to the highest ranks of Easons Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assadooty knowing that if I keep my eyes ahead and protect my flanks I'll be safe from all temptation and a credit to Easons and Ireland in general.\nWhat's this? says Mr. McCaffrey. Do we have here a twisting of the truth?\nI don't know, Mr. McCaffrey.\nLittle Barrington Street. That's a lane. Why are you calling it a street? You live in a lane, not a street.\nThey call it a street, Mr. McCaffrey.\nDon't be getting above yourself, boy.\nOh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.\nYou live in a lane and that means you have nowhere to go but up. Do\nyou understand that, McCourt?\nI do, sir.\nYou have to work your way out of the lane, McCourt. I do, Mr. McCaffrey.\nYou have the cut and jib of a lane boy, McCourt. Yes, Mr. McCaffrey.\nYou have the look of the lane all over you. All over you from poll to toe cap. Don't try to fool the populace, McCourt. You'd have to rise early in the morning to fool the likes of me.\nOh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.\nThen there's the eyes. Very sore eyes you have there. Can you see? I can, Mr. McCaffrey.\nYou can read and write but can you do addition and subtraction?\nI can, Mr. McCaffrey.\nWell, I don't know what the policy is on sore eyes. I would have to\nring Dublin and see where they stand on sore eyes. But your writing is clear, McCourt. A good fist. We'll take you on pending the decision on the sore eyes. Monday morning. Half six at the railway station.\nIn the morning? In the morning. We don't give out the bloody morning papers at night, do we?\nNo, Mr. McCaffrey.\nAnother thing. We distribute The Irish Times, a Protestant paper, run by the freemasons in Dublin. We pick it up at the railway station. We count it. We take it to the newsagents. But we don't read it. I don't want to see you reading it. You could lose the Faith and by the look of those eyes you could lose your sight. Do you hear me, McCourt?\nI do, Mr. McCaffrey.\nNo IrishTimes, and when you come in next week I'll tell you about all the English filth you're not to read in this office. Do you hear me?\nI do, Mr. McCaffrey.\nMrs. O'Connell has the tight mouth and she won't look at me. She says to Miss Barry, I hear a certain upstart from the lanes walked away from the post office exam. Too good for it, I suppose.\nTrue for you, says Miss Barry.\nToo good for us, I suppose.\nTrue for you.\nDo you think he'd ever tell us why he didn't take the exam?\nOh, he might, says Miss Barry, if we went down on our two knees. I tell her, I want to go to America, Mrs. O'Connell.\nDid you hear that, Miss Barry?\nI did, indeed, Mrs. O'Connell.\nHe spoke.\nHe did, indeed.\nHe will rue the day, Miss Barry.\nRue he will, Mrs. O'Connell.\nMrs. O'Connell talks past me to the boys waiting on the bench for\ntheir telegrams, This is Frankie McCourt who thinks he's too good for the post office.\nI don't think that, Mrs. O'Connell.\nAnd who asked you to open your gob, Mr. High and Mighty? Too grand for us, isn't he, boys?\nHe is, Mrs. O'Connell.\nAnd after all we did for him, giving him the telegrams with the good tips, sending him to the country on fine days, taking him back after his disgraceful behavior with Mr. Harrington, the Englishman, disrespecting the body of poor Mrs. Harrington, stuffing himself with ham sandwiches, getting fluthered drunk on sherry, jumping out the window and destroying every rosebush in sight, coming in here three sheets to the wind, and who knows what else he did delivering telegrams for two years, who knows indeed, though we have a good idea, don't we, Miss Barry?\nWe do, Mrs. O'Connell, though 'twouldn't be a fit subject to be talking about.\nShe whispers to Miss Barry and they look at me and shake their heads.\nA disgrace he is to Ireland and his poor mother. I hope she never finds out. But what would you expect of one born in America and his father from the North. We put up with all that and still took him back.\nShe keeps talking past me again to the boys on the bench.\nGoing to work for Easons he is, working for that pack of freemasons and Protestants above in Dublin. Too good for the post office but ready and willing to deliver all kinds of filthy English magazines all over Limerick. Every magazine he touches will be a mortal sin. But he's leaving now, so he is, and a sorry day it is for his poor mother that prayed for a son with a pension to take care of her in her latter days. So here, take your wages and go from the sight of us.\nMiss Barry says, He's a bad boy, isn't he, boys?\nHe is, Miss Barry.\nI don't know what to say. I don't know what I did wrong. Should I\nsay I'm sorry? Good-bye?\nI lay my belt and pouch on Mrs. O'Connell's desk. She glares at me,\nGo on. Go to your job at Easons. Go from us. Next boy, come up for your telegrams.\nThey're back at work and I'm down the stairs to the next part of my life.\nXVII\nI don't know why Mrs. O'Connell had to shame me before the whole world, and I don't think I'm too good for the post office or anything else. How could I with my hair sticking up, pimples dotting my face, my eyes red and oozing yellow, my teeth crumbling with the rot, no shoulders, no flesh on my arse after cycling thirteen thousand miles to deliver twenty thousand telegrams to every door in Limerick and regions beyond?\nMrs. O'Connell said a long time ago she knew everything about every telegram boy. She must know about the times I went at myself on top of Carrigogunnell, milkmaids gawking, little boys looking up.\nShe must know about Theresa Carmody and the green sofa, how I got her into a state of sin and sent her to hell, the worst sin of all, worse than Carrigogunnell a thousand times. She must know I never went to confession after Theresa, that I'm doomed to hell myself.\nA person that commits a sin like that is never too good for the post office or anything else.\nThe barman at South's remembers me from the time I sat with Mr. Hannon, Bill Galvin, Uncle Pa Keating, black white black. He remembers my father, how he spent his wages and his dole while singing patriotic songs and making speeches from the dock like a condemned rebel.\nAnd what is it you'd like? says the barman.\nI'm here to meet Uncle Pa Keating and have my first pint.\nOh, begod, is that a fact? He'll be here in a minute and sure\nthere's no reason why I shouldn't draw his pint and maybe draw your first pint, is there now?\nThere isn't, sir.\nUncle Pa comes in and tells me sit next to him against the wall. The barman brings the pints, Uncle Pa pays, lifts his glass, tells the men in the pub, This is my nephew, Frankie McCourt, son of Angela Sheehan, the sister of my wife, having his first pint, here's to your health and long life, Frankie, may you live to enjoy the pint but not too much.\nThe men lift their pints, nod, drink, and there are creamy lines on their lips and mustaches. I take a great gulp of my pint and Uncle Pa tells me, Slow down for the love o' Jasus, don't drink it all, there's more where that came from as long as the Guinness family stays strong and healthy.\nI tell him I want to stand him a pint with my last wages from the post office but he says, No, take the money home to your mother and you can stand me a pint when you come home from America flushed with success and the heat from a blonde hanging on your arm.\nThe men in the pub are talking about the terrible state of the world and how in God's name Hermann Goering escaped the hangman an hour before the hanging. The Yanks are over there in Nuremberg declaring they don't know how the Nazi bastard hid that pill. Was it in his ear? Up his nostril? Up his arse? Surely the Yanks looked in every hole and cranny of every Nazi they captured and still Hermann wiped their eye. There you are. It shows you can sail across the Atlantic, land in Normandy, bomb Germany off the face of the earth, but when all's said and done they can't find a little pill planted in the far reaches of Goering's fat arse.\nUncle Pa buys me another pint. It's harder to drink because it fills me and makes my belly bulge. The men are talking about\nconcentration camps and the poor Jews that never harmed a soul, men, women, children crammed into ovens, children, mind you, what harm could they do, little shoes scattered everywhere, crammed in, and the pub is misty and the voices fading in and out. Uncle Pa says, Are you all right? You're as white as a sheet. He takes me to the lavatory and the two of us have a good long piss against the wall which keeps moving back and forth. I can't go into the pub again, cigarette smoke, stale Guinness, Goering's fat arse, small shoes scattered, can't go in again, good night, Uncle Pa, thanks, and he tells me go straight home to my mother, straight home, oh, he doesn't know about the excitement in the loft or the excitement on the green sofa or me in such a state of doom that if I died now I'd be in hell in a wink.\nUncle Pa goes back to his pint. I'm out on O'Connell Street and why shouldn't I take the few steps to the Jesuits and tell all my sins this last night I'll be fifteen. I ring the bell at the priests'house and a big man answers, Yes? I tell him, I want to go to confession, Father. He says, I'm not a priest. Don't call me father. I'm a brother.\nAll right, Brother. I want to go to confession before I'm sixteen tomorrow. State o' grace on my birthday.\nHe says, Go away. You're drunk. Child like you drunk as a lord ringing for a priest at this hour. Go away or I'll call the guards.\nAh, don't. Ah, don't. I only want to go to confession. I'm doomed. You're drunk and you're not in a proper spirit of repentance.\nHe closes the door in my face. Another door closed in the face, but\nI'm sixteen tomorrow and I ring again. The brother opens the door, swings me around, kicks my arse and sends me tripping down the steps.\nHe says, Ring this bell again and I'll break your hand.\nJesuit brothers are not supposed to talk like that. They're supposed to be like Our Lord, not walking the world threatening people's hands.\nI'm dizzy. I'll go home to bed. I hold on to railings along Barrington Street and keep to the wall going down the lane. Mam is by the fire smoking a Woodbine, my brothers upstairs in the bed. She says, That's a nice state to come home in.\nIt's hard to talk but I tell her I had my first pint with Uncle Pa. No father to get me the first pint.\nYour Uncle Pa should know better.\nI stagger to a chair and she says, Just like your father. I try to control the way my tongue moves in my mouth. I'd rather be, I'd rather, rather be like my father than Laman Griffin.\nShe turns away from me and looks into the ashes in the range but I won't leave her alone because I had my pint, two pints, and I'm sixteen tomorrow, a man.\nDid you hear me? I'd rather be like my father than Laman Griffin. She stands up and faces me. Mind your tongue, she says.\nMind your own bloody tongue.\nDon't talk to me like that. I'm your mother.\nI'll talk to you any bloody way I like.\nYou have a mouth like a messenger boy.\nDo I? Do I? Well, I'd rather be a messenger boy than the likes of\nLaman Griffin oul' drunkard with the snotty nose and his loft and people climbing up there with him.\nShe walks away from me and I follow her upstairs to the small room. She turns, Leave me alone, leave me alone, and I keep barking at her,\nLaman Griffin, Laman Griffin, till she pushes me, Get out of this room, and I slap her on the cheek so that tears jump in her eyes and there's a small whimpering sound from her, You'll never have the chance to do that again, and I back away from her because there's another sin on my long list and I'm ashamed of myself.\nI fall into my bed, clothes and all, and wake up in the middle of the night puking on my pillow, my brothers complaining of the stink, telling me clean up, I'm a disgrace. I hear my mother crying and I want to tell her I'm sorry but why should I after what she did with Laman Griffin.\nIn the morning my small brothers are gone to school, Malachy is out looking for a job, Mam is at the fire drinking tea. I place my wages on the table by her elbow and turn to go. She says, Do you want a cup of tea?\nNo.\n'Tis your birthday.\nI don't care.\nShe calls up the lane after me, You should have something in your\nstomach, but I give her my back and turn the corner without answering. I still want to tell her I'm sorry but if I do I'll want to tell her she's the cause of it all, that she should not have climbed to the loft that night and I don't give a fiddler's fart anyway because I'm still writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane and saving to go to America.\nI have the whole day before I go to Mrs. Finucane to write the threatening letters and I wander down Henry Street till the rain drives me into the Franciscan church where St. Francis stands with his birds and lambs. I look at him and wonder why I ever prayed to him. No, I didn't pray, I begged.\nI begged him to intercede for Theresa Carmody but he never did a thing, stood up there on his pedestal with the little smile, the birds, the lambs, and didn't give a fiddler's fart about Theresa or me.\nI'm finished with you, St. Francis. Moving on. Francis. I don't know why they ever gave me that name. I'd be better off if they called me Malachy, one a king, the other a great saint. Why didn't you heal Theresa? Why did you let her go to hell? You let my mother climb to the loft. You let me get into a state of doom. Little children's shoes scattered in concentration camps. I have the abscess again. It's in my chest and I'm hungry.\nSt. Francis is no help, he won't stop the tears bursting out of my two eyes, the sniffling and choking and the God oh Gods that have me on my knees with my head on the back of the pew before me and I'm so weak with the hunger and the crying I could fall on the floor and would you please help me God or St. Francis because I'm sixteen today and I hit my mother and sent Theresa to hell and wanked all over Limerick and the county beyond and I dread the millstone around my neck.\nThere is an arm around my shoulders, a brown robe, click of black rosary beads, a Franciscan priest.\nMy child, my child, my child.\nI'm a child and I lean against him, little Frankie on his father's lap, tell me all about Cuchulain, Dad, my story that Malachy can't have or Freddie Leibowitz on the swings.\nMy child, sit here with me. Tell me what troubles you. Only if you want to. I am Father Gregory.\nI'm sixteen today, Father.\nOh, lovely, lovely, and why should that be a trouble to you?\nI drank my first pint last night.\nYes? I hit my mother.\nGod help us, my child. But He will forgive you. Is there anything\nelse?\nI can't tell you, Father.\nWould you like to go to confession?\nI can't, Father. I did terrible things.\nGod forgives all who repent. He sent His only Beloved Son to die\nfor us.\nI can't tell, Father. I can't.\nBut you could tell St. Francis, couldn't you?\nHe doesn't help me anymore.\nBut you love him, don't you?\nI do. My name is Francis.\nThen tell him. We'll sit here and you'll tell him the things that\ntrouble you. If I sit and listen it will only be a pair of ears for St. Francis and Our Lord. Won't that help?\nI talk to St. Francis and tell him about Margaret, Oliver, Eugene, my father singing Roddy McCorley and bringing home no money, my father sending no money from England, Theresa and the green sofa, my terrible sins on Carrigogunnell, why couldn't they hang Hermann Goering for what he did to the little children with shoes scattered around concentration camps, the Christian Brother who closed the door in my face, the time they wouldn't let me be an altar boy, my small brother Michael walking up the lane with the broken shoe clacking, my bad eyes that I'm ashamed of, the Jesuit brother who closed the door in my face, the tears in Mam's eyes when I slapped her.\nFather Gregory says, Would you like to sit and be silent, perhaps pray a few minutes?\nHis brown robe is rough against my cheek and there's a smell of soap. He looks at St. Francis and the tabernacle and nods and I suppose he's talking to God. Then he tells me kneel, gives me absolution, tells me say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, three Glory Bes. He tells me God forgives me and I must forgive myself, that God loves me and I must love myself for only when you love God in yourself can you love all God's creatures.\nBut I want to know about Theresa Carmody in hell, Father.\nNo, my child. She is surely in heaven. She suffered like the martyrs in olden times and God knows that's penance enough. You can be sure the sisters in the hospital didn't let her die without a priest.\nAre you sure, Father?\nI am, my child.\nHe blesses me again, asks me to pray for him, and I'm happy\ntrotting through the rainy streets of Limerick knowing Theresa is in heaven with the cough gone.\nMonday morning and it's dawn in the railway station. Newspapers and magazines are piled in bundles along the platform wall. Mr. McCaffrey is there with another boy, Willie Harold, cutting the twine on the bundles, counting, entering the count in a ledger. English newspapers and The Irish Times have to be delivered early, magazines later in the morning. We count out the papers and label them for delivery to shops around the city.\nMr. McCaffrey drives the van and stays at the wheel while Willie and I run into shops with bundles and take orders for the next day, add or drop in the ledger. After the papers are delivered we unload the magazines at the office and go home to breakfast for fifty minutes.\nWhen I return to the office there are two other boys, Eamon and Peter, already sorting magazines, counting and stuffing them into news agents' boxes along the wall. Small orders are delivered by Gerry Halvey on his messenger bicycle, big orders in the van. Mr. McCaffrey tells me stay in the office so that I can learn to count magazines and enter them in the ledger. The minute Mr. McCaffrey leaves Eamon and Peter pull out a drawer where they hide cigarette butts and light up. They can't believe I don't smoke. They want to know if there's something wrong with me, the bad eyes or the consumption maybe. How can you go out with a girl if you don't smoke? Peter says, Wouldn't you be a right eejit if you were going out the road with the girl and she asked you for a fag and you said you didn't smoke, wouldn't you be a right eejit then? How would you ever get her into a field for a bit of a feel? Eamon says, 'Tis what my father says about men who don't drink, they're not to be trusted. Peter says if you find a man that won't drink or smoke that's a man that's not even interested in girls and you'd want to keep your hand over the hole of your arse, that's what you'd want to be doing.\nThey laugh and that brings on the cough and the more they laugh the more they cough till they're holding on to one another banging one another between the shoulder blades and wiping tears from their cheeks. When the fit passes we pick out English and American magazines and look at the advertisements for women's underwear, brassieres and panties and long nylon stockings. Eamon is looking at an American magazine called See with pictures of Japanese girls who keep the soldiers happy so far away from home and Eamon says he has to go to the lavatory and when he does Peter gives me a wink, You know what he's up to in there, don't you? and sometimes Mr. McCaffrey gets into a state when boys linger in the lavatory interfering with themselves and wasting the valuable time for which Easons is paying them and on top of it putting their immortal souls in danger. Mr. McCaffrey won't come right out and say, Stop that wanking, because you can't accuse someone of a mortal sin unless you have proof. Sometimes he goes snooping in the lavatory when a boy comes out. He comes back himself with the threatening look and tells the boys, Ye are not to be looking at those dirty magazines from foreign parts. Ye are to count them and put them in the boxes and that's all.\nEamon comes back from the lavatory and Peter goes in with an American magazine, Collier's, that has pictures of girls in a beauty contest. Eamon says, Do you know what he's doing in there? At himself. Five times a day he goes in. Every time a new American magazine comes in with the women's underwear he goes in. Never done going at himself. Borrows magazines to take home unbeknownst to Mr. McCaffrey and God knows what he does with himself and the magazines all night. If he fell dead in there the jaws of hell would open wide.\nI'd like to get into the lavatory myself when Peter comes out but I don't want them saying, There he goes, new boy, first day on the job, already at himself. Won't light up a fag oh no but wanks away like an oul' billygoat.\nMr. McCaffrey returns from van delivery and wants to know why all the magazines aren't counted out, bundled and ready to go. Peter tells him, We were busy teaching the new boy, McCourt. God help us, he was a\nbit slow with the bad eyes you know but we kept at him and now he's getting faster.\nGerry Halvey, the messenger boy, won't be in for a week because he's entitled to his holidays and he wants to spend the time with his girlfriend, Rose, who's coming back from England. I'm the new boy and I have to be messenger boy while he's gone, cycling around Limerick on the bicycle with the big metal basket in front. He shows me how to balance papers and magazines so that the bicycle won't tip over with me in the saddle and a lorry passing by that will run over me and leave me like a piece of salmon in the road. He saw a soldier once that was run over by an army lorry and that's what he looked like, salmon.\nGerry is making a last delivery at Easons kiosk at the railway station at noon on Saturday and that's handy because I can meet him there to get the bicycle and he can meet Rose off the train. We stand at the gate waiting and he tells me he hasn't seen Rose in a year. She's over there working in a pub in Bristol and he doesn't like that one bit because the English are forever pawing the Irish girls, hands up under the skirts and worse, and the Irish girls are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their jobs. Everyone knows Irish girls keep themselves pure especially Limerick girls known the world over for their purity who have a man to come back to like Gerry Halvey himself. He'll be able to tell if she was true to him by her walk. If a girl comes back after a year with a certain class of a walk that's different from the one she went away with then you know she was up to no good with the Englishmen dirty horny bastards that they are.\nThe train hoots into the station and Gerry waves and points to Rose coming toward us from the far end of the train, Rose smiling away with her white teeth and lovely in a green dress. Gerry stops waving and mutters under his breath, Look at the walk on her, bitch, hoor, street walker, flaghopper, trollop, and runs from the station. Rose walks up to me, Was that Gerry Halvey you were standing with?\n'Twas.\nWhere is he?\nOh, he went out.\nI know he went out. Where did he go?\nI don't know. He didn't tell me. He just ran out.\nDidn't say anything?\nI didn't hear him say anything.\nDo you work with him?\nI do. I'm taking over the bike.\nWhat bike?\nThe messenger bike.\nIs he on a messenger bike?\nHe is.\nHe told me he worked in Easons office, clerk, inside job?\nI feel desperate. I don't want to make a liar of Gerry Halvey, to\nget him into trouble with the lovely Rose. Oh, we all take turns on the messenger bike. An hour in the office, an hour on the bike. The manager says 'tis good to get out in the fresh air.\nWell, I'll just go home and put my suitcase down and go to his house. I thought he'd carry this for me.\nI have the bike here and you can stick the case in the basket and I'll walk you home.\nWe walk up to her house in Carey's Road and she tells me she's so excited about Gerry. She saved her money in England and now she wants to go back with him and get married even if he's only nineteen and she's only seventeen. What matter when you're in love. I lived like a nun in England and dreamt of him every night and thank you very much for carrying my case.\nI turn away to jump on the bike and cycle back to Easons when Gerry comes at me from behind. His face is red and he's snorting like a bull. What were you doing with my girl, you little shite? Eh? What? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you did anything with my girl I'll kill you.\nI didn't do anything. Carried her case because 'twas heavy. Don't look at her again or you're dead.\nI won't, Gerry. I don't want to look at her.\nOh, is that a fact? Is she ugly or what?\nNo, no, Gerry, she's yours and she loves you. How do you know?\nShe told me.\nShe did?\nShe did, honest to God.\nJasus.\nHe bangs on her door, Rose, Rose, are you there? and she comes out,\nOf course, I'm here, and I ride away on the messenger bicycle with the sign on the basket that says Easons wondering about the way he's kissing her now and the terrible things he said about her in the station and wondering how Peter in the office could tell Mr. McCaffrey a barefaced lie about me and my eyes when all the time he and Eamon were looking at girls in their underwear and then going at themselves in the lavatory.\nMr. McCaffrey is in a terrible state in the office. Where were you? Great God above in heaven, does it take you all day to cycle from the railway station? We have an emergency here and we should have Halvey but he's gone off on his friggin' holidays, God forgive the language, and you'll have to cycle around as fast as you can, good thing you were a telegram boy that knows every inch of Limerick, and go to every bloody shop that's a customer and walk right in grab whatever copies you see of John O'London's Weekly tear out page sixteen and if anyone bothers you tell them 'tis government orders and they're not to interfere in government business and if they lay a finger on you they're liable to arrest, imprisonment and a large fine now go for God's sake and bring back every page sixteen you tear out so that we can burn them here in the fire.\nEvery shop, Mr. McCaffrey?\nI'll do the big ones, you do the small ones all the way to Ballinacurra and out the Ennis Road and beyond, God help us. Go on, go.\nI'm jumping on the bike and Eamon runs down the steps. Hey, McCourt, wait. Listen. Don't give him all the page sixteens when you come back.\nWhy?\nWe can sell 'em, me an' Peter.\nWhy?\n'Tis all about birth control and that's banned in Ireland.\nWhat's birth control?\nAw, Christ above, don't you know anything? 'Tis condoms, you know,\nrubbers, French letters, things like that to stop the girls from getting up the pole.\nUp the pole?\nPregnant. Sixteen years of age an' you're pure ignorant. Hurry up an' get the pages before everybody starts runnin' to the shop for John O'London's Weekly.\nI'm about to push away on the bike when Mr. McCaffrey runs down the steps. Hold on, McCourt, we'll go in the van. Eamon, you come with us.\nWhat about Peter?\nLeave him. He'll wind up with a magazine in the lavatory anyway. Mr. McCaffrey talks to himself in the van. Nice bloody how do you\ndo ringing down here from Dublin on a fine Saturday to send us tearing around Limerick ripping pages out of an English magazine when I could be at home with a cup of tea and a nice bun and a read of The Irish Press with my feet up on a box under the picture of the Sacred Heart nice bloody how do you do entirely.\nMr. McCaffrey runs into every shop with us behind him. He grabs the magazines, hands each of us a pile and tells us start tearing. Shop owners scream at him, What are ye doing? Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph, is it pure mad ye are? Put back them magazines or I'll call the guards.\nMr. McCaffrey tells them, Government orders, ma'am. There is filth in John O'London this week that's not fit for any Irish eyes and we are here to do God's work. What filth?\nWhat filth? Show me the filth before ye go mutilatin' the magazines. I won't pay Easons for these magazines, so I won't.\nMa'am, we don't care at Easons. We'd rather lose large amounts than have the people of Limerick and Ireland corrupted by this filth.\nWhat filth?\nCan't tell you. Come on, boys.\nWe throw the pages on the floor of the van and when Mr. McCaffrey\nis in a shop arguing we stuff some into our shirts. There are old magazines in the van and we tear and scatter them so that Mr. McCaffrey will think they're all page sixteen from John O'London.\nThe biggest customer for the magazine, Mr. Hutchinson, tells Mr. McCaffrey get to hell out of his shop or he'll brain him, get away from them magazines, and when Mr. McCaffrey keeps on tearing out pages Mr. Hutchinson throws him into the street, Mr. McCaffrey yelling that this is a Catholic country and just because Hutchinson is a Protestant that doesn't give him the right to sell filth in the holiest city in Ireland. Mr. Hutchinson says, Ah, kiss my arse, and Mr. McCaffrey says, See, boys? See what happens when you're not a member of the True Church?\nSome shops says they've already sold all their copies of John O'London and Mr. McCaffrey says, Oh, Mother o'God, what's going to become of us all? Who did ye sell them to?\nHe demands the names and address of the customers who are in danger of losing their immortal souls from reading articles on birth control. He will go to their houses and rip out that filthy page but the shopkeepers say, 'Tis Saturday night, McCaffrey, and getting dark and would you ever take a good running jump for yourself.\nOn the way back to the office Eamon whispers to me in the back of the van, I have twenty-one pages. How many do you have? I tell him fourteen but I have over forty and I'm not telling him because you never have to tell the truth to people who lie about your bad eyes. Mr. McCaffrey tells us bring in the pages from the van. We scoop up everything on the floor and he's happy sitting at his desk at the other end of the office ringing Dublin to tell them how he stormed through\nshops like God's avenger and saved Limerick from the horrors of birth control while he watches a dancing fire of pages that have nothing to do with John O'London's Weekly.\nMonday morning I cycle through the streets delivering magazines and people see the Easons sign on the bike and stop me to see if there's any chance they could get their hands on a copy of John O'London's Weekly. They're all rich looking people, some in motor cars, men with hats, collars and ties, and two fountain pens in their pockets, women with hats and little bits of fur dangling from their shoulders, people who have tea at the Savoy or the Stella and stick out their little fingers to show how well bred they are and now want to read this page about birth control.\nEamon told me early in the day, Don't sell the bloody page for less than five shillings. I asked him if he was joking. No, he wasn't. Everyone in Limerick is talking about this page and they're dying to get their hands on it.\nFive shillings or nothing, Frankie. If they're rich charge more but that's what I'm charging so don't be going around on your bicycle and puttin' me out of business with low prices. We have to give Peter something or he'll be running to McCaffrey and spilling the beans.\nSome people are willing to pay seven shillings and sixpence and I'm rich in two days with over ten pounds in my pocket minus one for Peter the snake, who would betray us to McCaffrey. I put eight pounds in the post office for my fare to America and that night we have a big supper of ham, tomatoes, bread, butter, jam. Mam wants to know if I won the sweepstakes and I tell her people give me tips. She's not happy I'm a messenger boy because that's the lowest you can drop in Limerick but if it brings in ham like this we should light a candle in gratitude. She doesn't know the money for my fare is growing in the post office and she'd die if she knew what I was earning from writing threatening letters.\nMalachy has a new job in the stockroom of a garage handing out parts to mechanics and Mam herself is taking care of an old man, Mr. Sliney, out in the South Circular Road while his two daughters go off to work every day. She tells me if I'm delivering papers out there to come to the house for tea and a sandwich. The daughters will never know and the old man won't mind because he's only half conscious most of the time worn out from all his years in the English army in India.\nShe looks peaceful in the kitchen of this house in her spotless apron, everything clean and polished around her, flowers bobbing in the garden beyond, birds chirping away, music from Radio Eireann on the wireless. She sits at the table with a pot of tea, cups and saucers, plenty of bread, butter, cold meats of all kinds. I can have any class of a sandwich but all I know is ham and brawn. She doesn't have any brawn because that's the kind of thing you'd find people eating in lanes not in a house on the South Circular Road. She says the rich won't eat brawn because it's what they scoop off floors and counters in bacon factories and you never know what you're getting. The rich are very particular about what they stick between two slices of bread. Over in America brawn is called head cheese and she doesn't know why.\nShe gives me a ham sandwich with juicy slices of tomato and tea in a cup with little pink angels flying around shooting arrows at other little flying angels who are blue and I wonder why they can't make teacups and chamber pots without all kinds of angels and maidens cavorting in the glen. Mam says that's the way the rich are, they love\nthe bit of decoration and wouldn't we if we had the money. She'd give her two eyes to have a house like this with flowers and birds abroad in the garden and the wireless playing that lovely Warsaw Concerto or the Dream of Olwyn and no end of cups and saucers with angels shooting arrows.\nShe says she has to look in on Mr. Sliney he's so old and feeble he forgets to call for the chamber pot.\nChamber pot? You have to empty his chamber pot?\nOf course I do. There's a silence here because I think we're remembering the cause of all our troubles, Laman Griffin's chamber pot. But that was a long time ago and now it's Mr. Sliney's chamber pot, which is no harm because she's paid for this and he's harmless. When she comes back she tells me Mr. Sliney would like to see me, so come in while he's awake.\nHe's lying in a bed in the front parlor, the window blocked with a black sheet, no sign of light. He tells my mother, Lift me up a bit, missus, and pull back that bloody thing off the window so I can see the boy. He has long white hair down to his shoulders. Mam whispers he won't let anyone cut it. He says, I have me own teeth, son. Would you credit that? Do you have your own teeth, son?\nI do, Mr. Sliney.\nAh. I was in India you know. Me and Timoney up the road. Bunch of Limerick men in India. Do you know Timoney, son?\nI did, Mr. Sliney.\nHe's dead, you know. Poor bugger went blind. I have me sight. I have me teeth. Keep your teeth, son.\nI will, Mr. Sliney.\nI'm getting tired, son, but there's one thing I want to tell you. Are you listening to me?\nI am, Mr. Sliney.\nIs he listening to me, missus?\nOh, he is, Mr. Sliney.\nGood. Now here's what I want to tell you. Lean over here so I can\nwhisper in your ear. What I want to tell you is, Never smoke another man's pipe.\n***\nHalvey goes off to England with Rose and I have to stay on the messenger bike all through the winter. It's a bitter winter, ice everywhere, and I never know when the bike will go out from under me and send me flying into the street or onto the pavement, magazines and papers scattered. Shops complain to Mr. McCaffrey that The Irish Times is coming in decorated with bits of ice and dog shit and he mutters to us that's the way that paper should be delivered, Protestant rag that it is.\nEvery day after my deliveries I take The Irish Times home and read it to see where the danger is. Mam says it's a good thing Dad isn't here. He'd say, Is this what the men of Ireland fought and died for that my own son is sitting there at the kitchen table reading the freemason paper?\nThere are letters to the editor from people all over Ireland claiming they heard the first cuckoo of the year and you can read between the lines that people are calling each other liars. There are reports about Protestant weddings and pictures and the women always look lovelier than the ones we know in the lanes. You can see Protestant women have perfect teeth although Halvey's Rose had lovely teeth.\nI keep reading The Irish Times and wondering if it's an occasion of sin though I don't care. As long as Theresa Carmody is in heaven not\ncoughing I don't go to confession anymore. I read The Irish Times and TheTimes of London because that tells me what the King is up to every day and what Elizabeth and Margaret are doing.\nI read English women's magazines for all the food articles and the answers to women's questions. Peter and Eamon put on English accents and pretend they're reading from English women's magazines.\nPeter says, Dear Miss Hope, I'm going out with a fellow from Ireland named McCaffrey and he has his hands all over me and his thing pushing against my belly button and I'm demented not knowing what to do. I remain, yours anxiously, Miss Lulu Smith, Yorkshire.\nEamon says, Dear Lulu, If this McCaffrey is that tall that he's pushing his yoke against your belly button I suggest you find a smaller man who will slip it between your thighs. Surely you can find a decent short man in Yorkshire.\nDear Miss Hope, I am thirteen years old with black hair and something terrible is happening and I can't tell anyone not even my mother. I'm bleeding every few weeks you know where and I'm afraid I'll be found out. Miss Agnes Tripple, Little Biddle-on-the-Twiddle, Devon.\nDear Agnes, You are to be congratulated. You are now a woman and you can get your hair permed because you are having your monthlies. Do not fear your monthlies for all Englishwomen have them. They are a gift of God to purify us so that we can have stronger children for the empire, soldiers to keep the Irish in their place. In some parts of the world a woman with a monthly is unclean but we British cherish our women with the monthlies, oh we do indeed.\nIn the springtime there's a new messenger boy and I'm back in the office. Peter and Eamon drift off to England. Peter is fed up with Limerick, no girls, and you're driven to yourself, wank wank wank, that's all we ever do in Limerick. There are new boys. I'm senior boy and the job is easier because I'm fast and when Mr. McCaffrey is out in the van and my work is done I read the English, Irish, American magazines and papers. Day and night I dream of America.\nMalachy goes to England to work in a rich Catholic boys' boarding school and he walks around cheerful and smiling as if he's the equal of any boy in the school and everyone knows when you work in an English boarding school you're supposed to hang your head and shuffle like a proper Irish servant. They fire him for his ways and Malachy tells them they can kiss his royal Irish arse and they say that's the kind of foul language and behavior you'd expect. He gets a job in the gas works in Coventry shoveling coal into the furnaces like Uncle Pa Keating, shoveling coal and waiting for the day he can go to America after me.\nXVIII\nI'm seventeen, eighteen, going on nineteen, working away at Easons, writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane, who says she's not long for this world and the more Masses said for her soul the better she'll feel. She puts money in envelopes and sends me to churches around the city to knock on priests' doors, hand in the envelopes with the request for Masses. She wants prayers from all the priests but the Jesuits. She says, They're useless, all head and no heart. That's what they should\nhave over their door in Latin and I won't give them a penny because every penny you give a Jesuit goes to a fancy book or a bottle of wine.\nShe sends the money, she hopes the Masses are said, but she's never sure and if she's not sure why should I be handing out all that money to priests when I need the money to go to America and if I keep back a few pounds for myself and put it in the post office who will ever know the difference and if I say a prayer for Mrs. Finucane and light candles for her soul when she dies won't God listen even if I'm a sinner long past my last confession.\nI'll be nineteen in a month. All I need is a few pounds to make up the fare and a few pounds in my pocket when I land in America.\nThe Friday night before my nineteenth birthday Mrs. Finucane sends me for the sherry. When I return she is dead in the chair, her eyes wide open, and her purse on the floor wide open. I can't look at her but I help myself to a roll of money. Seventeen pounds. I take the key to the trunk upstairs. I take forty of the hundred pounds in the trunk and the ledger. I'll add this to what I have in the post office and I have enough to go to America. On my way out I take the sherry bottle to save it from being wasted.\nI sit by the River Shannon near the dry docks sipping Mrs. Finucane's sherry. Aunt Aggie's name is in the ledger. She owes nine pounds. It might have been the money she spent on my clothes a long time ago but now she'll never have to pay it because I heave the ledger into the river. I'm sorry I'll never be able to tell Aunt Aggie I saved her nine pounds. I'm sorry I wrote threatening letters to the poor people in the lanes of Limerick, my own people, but the ledger is gone, no one will ever know what they owe and they won't have to pay their balances. I wish I could tell them, I'm your Robin Hood.\nAnother sip of the sherry. I'll spare a pound or two for a Mass for Mrs. Finucane's soul. Her ledger is well on its way down the Shannon and out to the Atlantic and I know I'll follow it someday soon.\nThe man at O'Riordan's Travel Agency says he can't get me to America by air unless I travel to London first, which would cost a fortune. He can put me on a ship called the Irish Oak, which will be leaving Cork in a few weeks. He says, Nine days at sea, September October, best time of the year, your own cabin, thirteen passengers, best of food, bit of a holiday for yourself and that will cost fifty-five pounds, do you have it?\nI do.\nI tell Mam I'm going in a few weeks and she cries. Michael says, Will we all go some day?\nWe will.\nAlphie says, Will you send me a cowboy hat and a thing you throw that comes back to you?\nMichael tells him that's a boomerang and you'd have to go all the way to Australia to get the likes of that, you can't get it in America.\nAlphie says you can get it in America yes you can and they argue about America and Australia and boomerangs till Mam says, For the love o' Jesus, yeer brother is leaving us and the two of ye are there squabbling over boomerangs. Will ye give over?\nMam says we'll have to have a bit of party the night before I go. They used to have parties in the old days when anyone would go to America, which was so far away the parties were called American wakes because the family never expected to see the departing one again in this\nlife. She says 'tis a great pity Malachy can't come back from England but we'll be together in America someday with the help of God and His Blessed Mother.\nOn my days off from work I walk around Limerick and look at all the places we lived, the Windmill Street, Hartstonge Street, Roden Lane, Rosbrien Road, Little Barrington Street, which is really a lane. I stand looking at Theresa Carmody's house till her mother comes out and says, What do you want? I sit at the graves of Oliver and Eugene in the old St. Patrick's Burying Ground and cross the road to St. Lawrence's Cemetery where Theresa is buried. Wherever I go I hear voices of the dead and I wonder if they can follow you across the Atlantic Ocean.\nI want to get pictures of Limerick stuck in my head in case I never come back. I sit in St. Joseph's Church and the Redemptorist church and tell myself take a good look because I might never see this again. I walk down Henry Street to say good-bye to St. Francis though I'm sure I'll be able to talk to him in America.\nNow there are days I don't want to go to America. I'd like to go to O'Riordan's Travel Agency and get back my fifty-five pounds. I could wait till I'm twenty-one and Malachy can go with me so that I'll know at least one person in New York. I have strange feelings and sometimes when I'm sitting by the fire with Mam and my brothers I feel tears coming and I'm ashamed of myself for being weak. At first Mam laughs and tells me, Your bladder must be near your eye, but then Michael says, We'll all go to America, Dad will be there, Malachy will be there and we'll all be together, and she gets the tears herself and we sit there, the four of us, like weeping eejits.\nMam says this is the first time we ever had a party and isn't it a sad thing altogether that you have it when your children are slipping away one by one, Malachy to England, Frank to America. She saves a few shillings from her wages taking care of Mr. Sliney to buy bread, ham, brawn, cheese, lemonade and a few bottles of stout. Uncle Pa Keating brings stout, whiskey and a little sherry for Aunt Aggie's delicate stomach and she brings a cake loaded with currants and raisins she baked herself. The Abbot brings six bottles of stout and says, That's all right, Frankie, ye can all drink it as long as I have a bottle or two for meself to help me sing me song.\nHe sings \"The Road to Rasheen. \" He holds his stout, closes his eyes, and song comes out in a high whine. The words make no sense and everyone wonders why tears are seeping from his shut eyes. Alphie whispers to me, Why is he crying over a song that makes no sense?\nI don't know.\nThe Abbot ends his song, opens his eyes, wipes his cheeks and tells us that was a sad song about an Irish boy that went to America and got shot by gangsters and died before a priest could reach his side and he tells me don't be gettin' shot if you're not near a priest.\nUncle Pa says that's the saddest song he ever heard and is there any chance we could have something lively. He calls on Mam and she says, Ah, no, Pa, sure I don't have the wind.\nCome on, Angela, come on. One voice now, one voice and one voice\nonly.\nAll right. I'll try.\nWe all join in the chorus of her sad song,\nA mother's love is a blessing No matter where you roam. Keep her while you have her,\nYou'll miss her when she's gone.\nUncle Pa says one song is worse than the one before and are we turning this night into a wake altogether, is there any chance someone would sing a song to liven up the proceedings or will he be driven to drink with the sadness.\nOh, God, says Aunt Aggie, I forgot. The moon is having an eclipse abroad this minute.\nWe stand out in the lane watching the moon disappear behind a round black shadow. Uncle Pa says, That's a very good sign for you going to America, Frankie.\nNo, says Aunt Aggie, 'tis a bad sign. I read in the paper that the moon is practicing for the end of the world.\nOh, end of the world my arse, says Uncle Pa. 'Tis the beginning for Frankie McCourt. He'll come back in a few years with a new suit and fat on his bones like any Yank and a lovely girl with white teeth hangin' from his arm.\nMam says, Ah, no, Pa, ah, no, and they take her inside and comfort her with a drop of sherry from Spain.\nIt's late in the day when the Irish Oak sails from Cork, past Kinsale and Cape Clear, and dark when lights twinkle on Mizen Head, the last of Ireland I'll see for God knows how long.\nSurely I should have stayed, taken the post office examination, climbed in the world. I could have brought in enough money for Michael and Alphie to go to school with proper shoes and bellies well filled. We could have moved from the lane to a street or even an avenue where houses have gardens. I should have taken that examination and Mam would never again have to empty the chamber pots of Mr. Sliney or anyone else.\nIt's too late now. I'm on the ship and there goes Ireland into the night and it's foolish to be standing on this deck looking back and thinking of my family and Limerick and Malachy and my father in England and even more foolish that songs are going through my head Roddy McCorley goes to die and Mam gasping Oh the days of the Kerry dancing with poor Mr. Clohessy hacking away in the bed and now I want Ireland back at least I had Mam and my brothers and Aunt Aggie bad as she was and Uncle Pa, standing me my first pint, and my bladder is near my eye and here's a priest standing by me on the deck and you can see he's curious.\nHe's a Limerickman but he has an American accent from his years in Los Angeles. He knows how it is to leave Ireland, did it himself and never got over it. You live in Los Angeles with sun and palm trees day in day out and you ask God if there's any chance He could give you one soft rainy Limerick day.\nThe priest sits beside me at the table of the First Officer, who tells us ship's orders have been changed and instead of sailing to New York we're bound for Montreal.\nThree days out and orders are changed again. We are going to New York after all.\nThree American passengers complain, Goddam Irish. Can't they get it straight?\nThe day before we sail into New York orders are changed again. We are going to a place up the Hudson River called Albany.\nThe Americans say, Albany? Goddam Albany? Why the hell did we have to sail on a goddam Irish tub? Goddam.\nThe priest tells me pay no attention. All Americans are not like that.\nI'm on deck the dawn we sail into New York. I'm sure I'm in a film, that it will end and lights will come up in the Lyric Cinema. The priest wants to point out things but he doesn't have to. I can pick out the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Brooklyn Bridge. There are thousands of cars speeding along the roads and the sun turns everything to gold. Rich Americans in top hats white ties and tails must be going home to bed with the gorgeous women with white teeth. The rest are going to work in warm comfortable offices and no one has a care in the world.\nThe Americans are arguing with the captain and a man who climbed aboard from a tugboat. Why can't we get off here? Why do we have to sail all the goddam way to goddam Albany?\nThe man says, Because you're passengers on the vessel and the captain is the captain and we have no procedures for taking you ashore.\nOh, yeah. Well, this is a free country and we're American citizens.\nIs that a fact? Well, you're on an Irish ship with an Irish captain and you'll do what he goddam tells you or swim ashore.\nHe climbs down the ladder, tugboat chugs away, and we sail up the Hudson past Manhattan, under the George Washington Bridge, past hundreds of Liberty ships that did their bit in the war, moored now and ready to rot.\nThe captain announces the tide will force us to drop anchor overnight opposite a place called, the priest spells it for me, Poughkeepsie. The priest says that's an Indian name and the Americans say goddam Poughkeepsie.\nAfter dark a small boat put-puts to the ship and an Irish voice calls up, Hello, there. Bejasus, I saw the Irish flag, so I did. Couldn't believe me two eyes. Hello, there.\nHe invites the First Officer to go ashore for a drink and bring a friend and, You, too, Father. Bring a friend.\nThe priest invites me and we climb down a ladder to the small boat with the First Officer and the Wireless Officer. The man in the boat says his name is Tim Boyle from Mayo God help us and we docked there at the right time because there's a bit of a party and we're all invited. He takes us to a house with a lawn, a fountain and three pink birds standing on one leg. There are five women in a room called a living room. The women have stiff hair, spotless frocks. They have glasses in their hands and they're friendly and smile with perfect teeth. One says, Come right in. Just in time for the pawty.\nPawty. That's the way they talk and I suppose I'll be talking like that in a few years.\nTim Boyle tells us the girls are having a bit of a time while their husbands are away overnight hunting deer, and one woman, Betty, says, Yeah. Buddies from the war. That war is over nearly five years and they can't get over it so they shoot animals every weekend and drink Rheingold till they can't see. Goddam war, excuse the language, Fawder.\nThe priest whispers to me, These are bad women. We won't stay here long.\nThe bad women say, Whatcha like to drink? We got everything. What's your name, honey?\nFrank McCourt.\nNice name. So you take a little drink. All the Irish take a little drink. You like a beer?\nYes, please. Gee, so polite. I like the Irish. My grandmother was half Irish so that makes me half, quarter? I dunno. My name is Frieda. So here's your beer, honey.\nThe priest sits at the end of a sofa which they call a couch and two women talk to him. Betty asks the First Officer if he'd like to see the house and he says, Oh, I would, because we don't have houses like this in Ireland. Another woman tells the Wireless Officer he should see what they have growing in the garden, you wouldn't believe the flowers. Frieda asks me if I'm okay and I tell her yes but would she mind telling me where the lavatory is.\nThe what?\nLavatory.\nOh, you mean the bathroom. Right this way, honey, down the hall. Thanks.\nShe pushes in the door, turns on the light, kisses my cheek and\nwhispers she'll be right outside if I need anything.\nI stand at the toilet bowl firing away and wonder what I'd need at\na time like this and if this is a common thing in America, women waiting outside while you take a splash.\nI finish, flush and go outside. She takes my hand and leads me into a bedroom, puts down her glass, locks the door, pushes me down on the bed. She's fumbling at my fly. Damn buttons. Don't you have zippers in Ireland? She pulls out my excitement climbs up on me slides up and down up and down Jesus I'm in heaven and there's a knock on the door the priest Frank are you in there Frieda putting her finger to her lips and her eyes rolling to heaven Frank are you in there Father would you ever take a good running jump for yourself and oh God oh Theresa do you see what's happening to me at long last I don't give a fiddler's fart if the Pope himself knocked on this door and the College of Cardinals gathered gawking at the windows oh God the whole inside of me is gone into her and she collapses on me and tells me I'm wonderful and would I ever consider settling in Poughkeepsie.\nFrieda tells the priest I had a bit of a dizziness after going to the bathroom, that's what happens when you travel and you're drinking a strange beer like Rheingold, which she believes they don't have in Ireland. I can see the priest doesn't believe her and I can't stop the way the heat is coming and going in my face. He already wrote down my mother's name and address and now I'm afraid he'll write and say your fine son spent his first night in America in a bedroom in Poughkeepsie romping with a woman whose husband was away shooting deer for a bit of relaxation after doing his bit for America in the war and isn't this a fine way to treat the men who fought for their country.\nThe First Officer and the Wireless Officer return from their tours of the house and the garden and they don't look at the priest. The women tell us we must be starving and they go into the kitchen. We sit in the living room saying nothing to each other and listening to the women whispering and laughing in the kitchen. The priest whispers to me again, Bad women, bad women, occasion of sin, and I don't know what to say to him.\nThe bad women bring out sandwiches and pour more beer and when we finish eating they put on Frank Sinatra records and ask if anyone would like to dance. No one says yes because you'd never get up and dance with bad women in the presence of a priest, so the women dance with each other and laugh as if they all had little secrets. Tim Boyle drinks whiskey and\nfalls asleep in a corner till Frieda wakes him and tells him take us back to the ship. When we're leaving Frieda leans toward me as if she might kiss my cheek but the priest says good night in a very sharp way and no one shakes hands. As we walk down the street to the river we hear the women laughing, tinkling and bright in the night air.\nWe climb the ladder and Tim calls to us from his little boat, Mind yourselves going up that ladder. Oh, boys, oh, boys, wasn't that a grand night? Good night, boys, and good night, Father.\nWe watch his little boat till it disappears into the dark of the Pough- keepsie riverbank. The priest says good night and goes below and the First Officer follows him.\nI stand on the deck with the Wireless Officer looking at the lights of America twinkling. He says, My God, that was a lovely night, Frank. Isn't this a great country altogether?\nXIX 'Tis.3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1280054", "artist_names": "Frank Sinatra", "full_title": "Stardust

dip\n\nI want a love that's honest square\nCan't seem to find somebody to care\nI'm on a lonely road that leads me nowhere\nI want a Sunday kind of love\nI do my Sunday dreamin' and all my Sunday schemin'\nEvery minute, every hour, every day\nI'm hopin' to discover a certain kind of lover\nWho will show me the way\n\nMy arms need someone to enfold\nTo keep me warm when Mondays are cold\nA love for all my life to have and to hold\nI want a Sunday kind of love\n\nBop-p-p-bop bop bop-p-bop-p-bop bopYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

Black  boots,\nblack skin-tight pants, and a mane of\nthick, black hair presents a beautiful\nand imposing  figure. Her eyes are\nlarge and dark -- her look open and\nripe.  She knows what she's got, and\ndoesn't make any excuses for it -- but\nthe fact is she's scared as hell,\npossessing a  vulnerability that\nsurprises her by its suddenness.  An\nexpensive gold chain is fastened on one\nboot.\n\nShe scrounges through her bag -- pulls\nout her remaining cash. It's drastically\nshort of what she owes and she knows it.\nShe tosses it onto the front seat,\nJUMPS from the cab, streaks across the\nstreet.

He headlines a slick\ntechno-funk group called THE TIME which\nsports gangster suits and wide-brimmed\nhats. He's gifted with a wealth of self-\nlaudatory humor which he uses like a\nknife, moving through life with a calm,\nbut ruthless grace.\n\nMake no mistake, Morris is nobody's\nfool.   His seeming out-raceousness, his\ncharm -- every move he makes is for a\ncalculated effect.  He knows exactly\nwhat the ladies need, and doesn't mind\nreminding them should they forget ...\n\n\nHe breaks into a wide grin.  Hair\nstanding up like Don King, he wipes off\na hand mirror, regards himself\nunabashedly as he brushes his teeth.\n\n\"Let's Get Crazy\" continues as we...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n(5) INT.  BASEMENT,  PRINCE'S HOME -- NIGHT\n\nPrince sits in front of the mirror,\nfinishes applying his makeup.

He\nhoists himself through it, disappears\ninto the night.\n\n\"Let's Get Crazy\" continues as we ...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n(6) EXT.

A yellow\nbandanna holds up his hair.\n\nThe bedroom is a MESS.  A VACUUM CLEANER\nstands like a sentry in the middle of\nthe floor.  He turns it on, blazes a\npath to his closet.  He yanks out a well-\npressed suit, holds it against him,\nstrikes a sexy, half-lidded pose only a\nmother could love--\n\nMORRIS\n(awed)\nOh, Lord ...\n\n\"Let's Get Crazy\" continues as we ...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n(8) EXT.

Prince,\nriding his MOTORCYCLE, weaves between\njammed cars, then blasts down a narrow\nalley leading to the rear entrance.  His\nguitar is slung across his back.

She grabs\nher bag, rushes into a dark alley.  She\npulls a handful of CASH from her pocket,\ncounts through it quickly.\n\n'Let's Get Crazy\" -continues as we ...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n(10) EXT.  MORRIS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n\nThe DOOR opens -- Morris steps\nconfidently into the night. The change\nin his appearance is breathtaking. A\ncashmere coat is draped over his\nshoulders, a white scarf hangs loosely\nabout his neck.  Wearing a sharp,\ngangster-style suit, his hair is a\npompadour, and Stacy Adams on his feet -\n- Morris is the very picture of\nelegance.   He doesn't just walk to the\ncurb, he slides -- his promenade\npunctuated with a dip at the knees you\ncould snap your fingers to.\n\nJEROME is at the curb, buffing down the\nbumper of a yellow, 1970 Fleetwood\nCadillac.  Jerome is solidly built,\nsmooth-faced handsome with a boyish\ncharm all his own.  He's a member of The\nTime, and acts as Morris' chauffeur,\nvalet, and all-purpose shadow.\n\nHe moves quickly to the door, holds it\nopen as Morris settles himself into the\nbackseat. He closes it with a flair,\nhops behind the wheel, pulls out.\n\n'Let's Get Crazy\" continues as we...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n(11) INT.

BOBBY sits off to the side,\nhis drumsticks tapping against his knee.\nMATT puts on his doctor's smock.

MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT\n\nThe DOOR opens -- A LIGHT goes on.\nVanity stands in the hallway,  peers\ncautiously into a squalid, rundown room.\nShe hesitates briefly, seems to sigh,\nthen indicates she will take it.  The\nMANAGER closes the door as he leaves.\n\nShe stands a moment, surveys the room.\nA bed and bureau, sink, a chair,\nhotplate -- simply the essentials. She\npulls a dress from her bag, a pair of hi-\nheels, some gloves, underwear.  She\nhangs the dress on a rod, places the\nshoes beneath it, arranges the rest in a\nbureau drawer.  She looks around once\nmore -- flowered wallpaper peels from\nthe walls.\n\nShe rushes to the window, tears open the\nshutters -- iron bars obstruct her\nview...\n\n(13) EXT.

An ex-Marine,\nChick's function is obvious.  He cracks\nthe door--\n\n\nCHICK\nWhat?\n\nVANITY\nI have an appointment with the\nmanager.\n\nCHICK\nNo you don't -- he doesn't see\nanybody.\n\nSuddenly a FIGHT breaks out at the\nINSIDE MONEY WINDOW.  Chick spins\ninstantly, SLAMS the door -- but Vanity\njams her boot into the narrow space.\nThe door crashes against her instep, she\nwinces in pain --but Chick doesn't\nnotice.  He's already upon the\nOFFENDERS,  heaving them against the\nwall.\n\nVanity streaks inside, blazes up the\nstairway, ducks behind a GROUP of\nGIRLS...\n\nCHICK turns instantly -- the door is\nclosed -- VANITY, gone.

Why don't you look\nwhere you're going?\n\nShe's 18 years old, blonde and pretty in\na cute, innocent way.   A Daisy Mae-type\nwhose emotions form so quickly, she has\ntrouble sorting them out.

She walks back to Jill--\n\nVANITY\nOkay, so you got  me back,\nfine. Listen, I'm from out of\ntown. I have to see the\nmanager, it's important.  I'm\na real good singer and dancer.\nI know he could use me.\n\nJILL\nDo you have any experience?\n\nVanity simmers, enunciates every word--\n\nVANITY\nYeah...definitely.\n\nJILL\nFollow me.\n\nAnd she turns on her heels, makes her\nway through the club, moving into the\nvicinity of the stage.  Vanity follows\nher reluctantly, casts a look to the\nband.   She spots Prince for the first\ntime -- stops instantly...\n\nHis effect on her is instantaneous.\nPassion surges through her like a tidal\nwave.  His hair, face, eyes -- it all\nconspires to make her weak.  It's like\nmeeting someone for the first time, but\nseeing so much of yourself in them, that\ntheir lips, eyes, mouth -- you're\ncertain you have touched, and the desire\nto be with them becomes so strong that\nthe very act of touching will release\nyou in a way you never thought\npossible...\n\nPrince brines \"Let's Get Crazy\" to a\nrousing, blistering end.  Suddenly the\nstage is plunged into darkness. The\nCROWD goes WILD!\n\n...Vanity snaps out of it.  Jill is\ntugging at her arm, a puzzled look on\nher face--\n\nJILL\nHere, fill this out -- I'll\nhave him call you.\n\nVANITY\nI don't have a phone.  When\nwill he be back?\n\nJILL\nWell...you can try tomorrow.\n\nVANITY\nYou can count on  it.\n\nVanity hands the card back  to her --\nJill reads the name, address -- looks up\npuzzled--\n\nJILL\nVanity??\n\nBACKSTAGE\nas Morris and The Time pass Prince on\ntheir way to the stage--\n\nMORRIS\nWhy don't you stay awhile, see\nhow it's done.\n\nThe Band Members bust up -- but Prince\nignores them, then--\n\nMC\nLadies and gentlemen -- please\nwelcome The Time.\n\nCLUB\nSudden APPLAUSE and CRIES.  Vanity and\nJill turn directly into the path of\nPrince, descending the Steps of the\nstage.  Vanity gasps, LOCKS eyes with\nhim.  Jill seems to jump out of her skin\n-- it's obvious she has a crush on him\nsomething  awful--\n\nJILL\nHi ya,  Prince -- God I liked\nthat song, it's real fun.\n\nShe fidgets uncontrollably, Vanity's\ncard buring a hole into her hand.\nPrince glances at the card, then stares\nat Vanity,  the ripeness of her look\nparalyzing.   He tears his eyes away,\nputs on his sunglesses, looks toward the\nstage.\n\n(18A) INT.  CLUB -- NEAR STAGE -- NIGHT\n\nMORRIS and The Time rip into a funk tune\ncalled \"Jungle Love.\" Their stranglehold\non the audience is instantaneous.\nMorris struts across the stage like a\npanther, playing to the audience with a\nrelish.  His eyes fastened on Prince --\nhis pride umistakable.\n\nPRINCE watches Morris a moment, then\neyes Vanity again.  The heat between\nthem is apparent.  Vanity's heart is\npounding, she's not sure what to do.\nShe keeps her eyes on Morris, hoping\nthat a Solution will present itself.\n\nPRINCE watches as Jill tacks the card to\na board behind the bar.  Sizing up the\nsituation quickly, he again glances at\nVanity -- but her eyes are fastened on\nMorris.  Feeling terribly shy and\nthinking there's nothing he can do to\ndivert her attention away from him, he\nreluctantly heads for the front door.\nVanity finally hits upon something to\nsay, turns--\n\nVANITY\nI really liked your song\ntoo...\n\nBut he's gone.  Her eyes scan the room\nfrantically -- catches a glimpse of him\nleaving.  She takes a sudden step, then\nstops, paralyzed with indecision.  Jill\nregards ger coldly.\n\nMORRIS meanwhile is beside himself.\nSome gorgeous, dark-haired babe, eyes\nwide as saucers was starlng at him from\nthe bar.  Prince has left, and this girl\nis his.  He motions to Jerome,  and they\ndirect their act in her direction.\n\nJILL gazes at Vanity, fidgets intensely,\nsuspicious and resentful of her.   She\nglances up and notices Morris, look.\nShe seizes upon an idea,  forces a\nfriendly smile, taps Vanity on the\nshoulder--\n\nJILL\nHey ...\n\nShe points to the stage.  Vanity looks\nat Morris, and he goes crazy,\nentertaining her with his own special\nblend of showmanship.  The CROWD loves\nit!  Vanity is held a moment, but her\nthouchts are elsewhere. She finally\ncomes to a decision, pulls away, cuts\nthrough the club.\n\n(18B) INT.  FOYER AND STAIRWAY -- NIGHT\n\nas she runs down the stairs, cuts behind\nChick, BURSTS out the door.\n\n(19) EXT.

She starts running,\nshouts--\n\nVANITY\nHey  wait!\n\nBut Prince is too far away, the traffic\ntoo coneested for him to hear.  He whips\ndown the street, disappears around the\ncorner.\n\nVanity continues running, then slows,\ndejection overcoming her in waves.  She\nlooks around -- KIDS are staring at her,\npassing  jokes.  Embarrassed, She moves\nto the front door but Chick is there,\nhis eyes upon her cold, impassionate.\n\nExhausted and slighlty tearlul, she cuts\nacross the street, heads back to her\napartment.\n\n(20) EXT. PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\nPrince WHIPS down the street, cuts his\nmotor, coasts up the drive. He comes to\na stop against a wooden gate.  His house\nis a nondescript, one-family structure\nwith a wide front porch.  He lives in a\nneat and tidy, homogeneous, lower middle-\nclass neighborhood whose occupants are\nhard-working type fiercely protective of\ntheir privacy.\n\nHe climbs the steps to the porch, opens\nthe front door...\n\n...his mothers SCREAM is like ice in his\nveins.  Fear trickles into the hollows\nof his body like cold water,  His pain\ncommands him to move, but the impulse\nshort circuits somewhere at the waist,\nleaving his legs twitching\nuncontrollably.  Then another SCREAM\nfrom his mother, and his father's voice\nnow, LOUD and FURIOUS--\n\nFATHER (O.S.)\nListen to me!  You come home\nwhen I say come home!  You've\ngot no business in the\nstreets!\n\nWHACK!  His mother SCREAMS -- Prince\nBURSTS into the room.\n\n(21) INT. Prince's LIVING ROOM --  NIGHT\n\nPrince's MOTHER is at the far side of\nthe living room CRYING uncontrollable.\nShe's in her early 40's, a dark-haired,\nfaded beauty, with large, wild, anxious\neyes.  There's a detectable scent of\nliquor in the air, and her slurred\nspeech pins her as the source.\n\nHis FATHER is in his late 40's, a squat,\nbut solidly built black man, with a\ncherubic face, and graceful expressive\nhands.\n\nHe's upon her now, WHACKING! at her\nhorribly, trying to get to her face--\n\nFATHER\nYou do what I say, do you hear\nme?!

She topples to the floor, a\nlamp CRASHES to the ground.  Prince cuts\nthrough the room, lunges desperately in\nfront of him--\n\nPRINCE\n(pleading)\nPlease, Dad...she's heard you.\nShe's had enough!\n\nHis Mother drags herself up along the\nwall--\n\nMOTHER\n(hysterical)\nHe's  trying to kill me!

Prince's head snaps back, his\nfeet lift from the floor, his body\nCRASHES in a heap by the door...\n\nStunned SILENCE.  Prince, flat on his\nback, fights vertigo with everything\nhe's got.  His Mother lets out a YELP,\nrushes into the bedroom, SLAMS the door.\nHis Father stands motionless, sullen--\n\nFATHER\nGet up...you ain't hurt.\n\nPrince opens his Mouth, BLOOD gushes\nfrom a gash in his tongue.  He hoists\nhimself up slowly, using the wall for\nsupport.  He moves into the kitchen,\ndisappears down the basement steps.\n\n(22) BASEMENT -- HALLWAYS AND BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\nA naked LIGHT BULB snaps ON.  It dangles\nlike a pendulum, casting strange\nshadows.  The basement is partitioned\noff into a series of rooms,\ninterconnected by a labyrinthine\ncoimbination of passages.  An old washer\nand dryer stand in the corner.\n\nPrince descends the steps slowly.  He\ncomes through a door, closes it behind\nhim.  He moves down a narrow passageway,\nenters a small cramped BEDROOM.\n\nHe closes the door and locks it behind\nhim.  MOONLIGHT filters in throuch the\ncacement windows.  The total effect is\nlike entering a womb, a deep dark\nchamber of security and safety.\n\nLying heavily onto his bed, he sighs\nlong and deep, his eyes piercing the\ndarkness...\n\nFADE OUT:\n\nFADE IN:\n\n(23) INT.

It was a good\ninvestment.\n\nHe doesn't respond -- she suddenly feels\nshy--\n\nVANITY\nNo seriously -- My psychic did\ntell me.  I was in a play\nonce.\n\nPRINCE\nOh, yeah -- what did you play?\n\nVANITY\nIsadora Duncan...\n\nShe stretches her arms like a butterfly,\ndoes a little step--\n\nVANITY\nThat means I can sing and\ndance.\n(a beat)\nWant to help me?\n\nPRINCE\n(swiftly)\nNope.\n\nVANITY\n(surprised)\nPardon me?\n\nPRINCE\nNope.\n\nShe's Perplexed--\n\nPRINCE\nWant to know why?\n\nVANITY\n(defensively)\nNope.\n\nPRINCE\n(a beat)\nBecause you wouldn't pass the\ninitiation.\n\nVANITY\nWhat initiation?\n\nPRINCE\nWell, for starters ycu have to\npurify yourself in the waters\nof Lake Minnetonka.\n\nVANITY\nWhat?\n\nPRINCE\nYou have to purify yourself in\nLake Minnetonka.\n\nHer brow furrows, she looks out across\nthe lake.  He's calmly throwing stones.\nRecognizing a challenge when she sees\none, she formulates a plan, faces him\nseductively, shoots him an open look.\nHe stops suddenly, locks eyes with her,\nfeels his knees go weak.  Her hold on\nhim is unmistakable.  She pulls off her\nblouse in one fluid motion, tugs off her\nboots, drops her pants to the ground.\nShe's exquisite, takes a step toward\nhim.  Passion rings in his veins ...\n\nSuddenly she turns on her   heels, moves\npurposefully toward the water.  He's\nshocked,  realizes that she's about to\ngo in--\n\nPRINCE\nHey, wait a minute! Thats--\n\nBut she silences him savagely--\n\nVANITY\nWe made a deal!\n\nAnd before he can react she scampers\nalong a log, DIVES beneath the surface.\nHe can't believe it -- her spirit really\nimpresses him.  She breaks the surface\ncoughing and sputtering, hops and jumps\nto the shore--\n\nPRINCE\nHold it.\n\nVANITY\nWhat?\n\nPRINCE\nThat ain't Lake Minnetonka.\n\nHe tries to keep a straight face, jumps\non his motorcvcle, STARTS it up.  His\nwords take a moment to sink in, then--\n\nVANITY\n(enraged)\nYou bastard.  I don't believe\nit.  How could you do that to\nme?!\n\nShe gathers up her clothes, tries\ndesperately to put them on.  She slips\nand falls -- Prince can't help laughing-\n-\n\nVANITY\nDamn you -- I'll kill you.\n\nShe starts throwing stones.  He laughs,\nblasts up the path--\n\nVANITY\n(screaming)\nYou prick! Are you sick?! Is\nthis some kind of ritual   --\ngetting your kicks! How many\ngirls have you done this to?\n\nACCESS ROAD\n\nHe blazes up the embankment, SAILS\nthrough the air, drops expertly onto the\nroad.  He fishtails to a slick stop.\nVanity is by the lake, flailing about,\nthrowing things, trying to get into her\nboots--\n\nVANITY\nBastard!\n\nHe laughs heartily, wants to kid her,\nrides down the road as if he's leaving.\nHaving his fun, he slows, turns to go\nback ...\n\n...his smile dissolves instantly.\nVanity is in the middleof the road,\nflagging down a small PICKUP TRUCK.  She\nhops in, slams the door.  The truck\npeels out, bears down upon him.   He\ngesticulates his arms wildly --  wants\nto explain--\n\nPRINCE\nHey ...\n\nBut the truck streaks past -- Vanity's\nlook is cold, triumphant.\n\n(30) INT. CLUB (1ST AVE.  ST.  BAR) -- NIGHT\n\nMUSIC.  The CLUB is PACKED!  THE MODERN\nAIRES is onstage, a hi-techno funk\ngroup, performing their trademark, a\nfrenzied song entitled \"Modern Aire\"\nThe floor is dense with KIDS, all\nperforming the same syncopated dance.\n\nPRINCE moves through the club slowly,\nseems to be searching someone out.  His\nface is drawn and haggard, his spirits\nstrained.  He cuts past the BAR, barely\nacknowledges Jill, or the other\nWAITRESSES by her side, KIM and KATY.\nJill looks concerned--\n\nKIM\nHoney, you still chasing after\nthat fool?\n\nKim is 21 years and gorgeous, with dark\neyes, a smooth sculpted face, and taut\nshapely legs.  She is street-educated\nand doesn't need encouraging to speak\nher mind.  Katy is also in her-early\n20's, a tall, alluring Oriental, with an\nattractive, intelligent face--\n\nJILL\nI'm doing what I'm doing.\nIt's my business.\n\nKATY\nHe doesn't even look at you.\nThat's the last thing you want\nfrom a man.\n\nJILL\nYou just don't know him like I\ndo.\n\nKIM\nHoney... Look, Listen, and\nthen Feel.  If you do them in\nany other order, you're headed\nfor trouble.\n\nMatt and Bobby (members of Prince's\ngroup) stroll up--\n\nBOBBY\nHey, Jill -- where's our\ndrinks?\n\nJILL\nThey're coming -- just wait.\n\nMatt stares hungrily at her breasts--\n\nJILL\nWhat you want isn't on the\nmenu.\n\nBOBBY\nJill, in ten years they'll be\non the table.\n\nShe swats him with her order pad --\nBobby ducks, taunts her--\n\nBOBBY\nC'mon, c'mon ...\n\nShe goes to swing, Matt moves in,\nsqueezes her breasts--\n\nMATT\n(horn sound)\nBooPoo!!\n\nKIM\nGet out of here, you jerks!\n\nMATT\nSweetheart ... do you have a\nreal hot place where I could\nstick my nose?\n\nKIM\nSure -- try a microwave.\n\nThe Guys bust up, head for their tables-\n-\n\nKATY\nThose guys are deep.\n\nKIM\nYeah -- deeply retarded.\n\n(31) INT./EXT.

Her hair is swept back and\nwind-blown, her eyes dark and dancing.\nShe looks wickedly wonderful and knows\nit.\n\nCHICK stands by the window, arms folded,\nas massive as a Sequoia.  He regards her\nsuspiciously--\n\nVANITY\n(sweetly)\nI'm paying ... see?\n(to cashier, gruff)\nKeep the change.\n\nChick advances on her -- her eyes widen\nwith fear--\n\nCHICK\nThe manager wants to see you.\n\nVANITY\nReally..?  Oh, great...like to\nsee him too.\n\nShe breaths a sigh of relief.\n\nJEROME watches as Chick escorts Vanity\nto the upper level.  He stays short\ndistance behind.\n\n\n(32) INT. CLUB UPPER LEVEL -- NIGHT\n\nas Vanity and Chick come to a  halt in\nthe middle of the f Ioor--\n\nCHICK\nHe'll be right with you.\n\nChick walks away.  Jerome makes a move\ntoward her, but pulls himself up short -\n- BILLY SPARKS has approached her--\n\nBILLY SPARKS\nHi, I'm Billy Sparks, I manage\nthis place.\n\nVanity turns around -- her eyes widen\nwith surprise--\n\nHe's 38 years old, 5'3\" tall and weighs\nabout 180 pounds.  He's dressed in a\nbaby-blue running suit.and white tennis\nshoes that come to a point.  A dark-\nskinned, smooth-faced black man, he's\nwearing small, white sunglasses and a\nbase-ball cap perched on his head.  Fred\nFlintstone in Harlem.  A hip, fast-\ntalking jive motherfucker who uses\nprofanity like a light saber.  Chubby,\ncuddly, cherubic Billy Sparks.  He'd\nsell his mother if he thought he could\nmake a buck.\n\nThey size one another up in. about three\nseconds--\n\nVANITY\nHi -- I really like your club.\n\nBILLY\nReally...\n\nVANITY\nWhat time is it?\n\nBILLY\nNine, sweets.\n\nVANITY\nOh, that's a really nice\nwatch. Very pretty.\n\nBilly lights a cigarette, offers her\none, she accepts--\n\nVANITY\nYou  look like a guy I used to\ngo out with -- he was a lot\nolder, but I like older men.\n\nBILLY\nReally, what a coincidence.\n\nVANITY\nI just came off a Broadway\nplay.  My grandmother got\nsick.\n\nBILLY\nDoes she live here?\n\nVANITY\nNo, in New York ...\n(catches herself)\nBut, huh,  I have a sister\nhere, lives in Saint ... huh\n...\n\nBILLY\n...Paul.\n\nVANITY\nAmazing.\n\nBILLY\nYe-es.\n(smiles)\nWhat do you want to do?

I have\nsomething to show you.\n\nVANITY\nGreat.  See you later, Billy.\n\nShe walks away with Jerome, arm in arm--\n\nVANITY\nYou rescued me.\n\nJEROME\n(smiles)\nYe-es.\n\n(33) INT.  DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\nPrince and his band (Mark, Bobby, Matt,\nLisa) sit backstage, waiting to go on.\nAn air of tension permeates the room.\nLisa sits in the corner and fidgets,\ncasts sidelong looks to Prince.  He sits\napart from the group, deathly silent,\nlocked in thouqht.\n\nWendy walks in and shares a look with\nLisa.  She goes up to Prince, her voice\nfilled with nervousness--\n\nWENDY\nHi  ya, Prince.  I heard\nthrough the grapevine you had\na new tune written by two\ngreat girls.  By chance did\nyou hear it?\n\nHe stares at her -- if looks could kill\nWendy would be dead--\n\nLISA\nI knew it -- he didn't listen\nto it.  He probably dropped it\nunder his bike and rolled over\nit.\n\nPrince grunts, turns away -- Wendy is\namazed--\n\nWENDY\nWow! Okay...you think about\nthis.  I'm going to be real\nhonest with you.  You're\nreally being full of shit.\n\nLISA\nForget about it, Wendy.  Let's\nget out of here--\n\nBut Wendy, agitated, silences her with a\nfierce gesture--\n\nWENDY\n(to Prince)\nEvery time we give you a song,\nyou say you're going to use\nit, but you never do.  You\nalways think that we're doing\nsomething behind your back.\nYou're just being paranoid as\nusual.\n\nLISA\nWendy...\n\nWENDY\n(upset)\nShut up, Lisa, please!\n(to Prince)\nYou should know by now that we\nwouldn't hurt vou.  We're not\nout to put a dark cloud over\nyour head.  It's just to make\nyou feel good, Prince --\nthat's what it's all about.\nYou've been this way with us\nbefore, remember?\n\nPRINCE\n(maliciously)\nThe nominees for the best\nactress are--\n\nLISA\n-- Fuck it, Wendy -- let's\nbreak!\n\nWendy is shaking, tears spring to her\neyes--\n\nWENDY\nDo you know you can really,\nreally hurt people?  Doesn't\nthat mean anything to you?\nDoesn't that make you feel\nlike shit?\n\nLISA\nC'mon ...\n\nWENDY\nI'm tired of this ... I'm\nreally tired...\n\nThey leave the room, Wendy SLAMS the\ndoor behind her.  Prince casts a look to\nBobby, Mark, Matt--\n\nPRINCE\nYou tired, too?\n\nMATT\nGod got Wendy's periods\nreversed.  About every 28\ndays, she starts acting nice.\nLasts about a weekend.\n\nThud.  The joke hangs suspended like a\nball and chain.  Bobby gets up, the\nothers follow him to the door--\n\nBOBBY\nWhat difference does it make,\nPrince.  We're still a group,\nright?\n\nThey cut out the door.\n\n(34) INT.  HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n\nBobby, Matt and Mark move briskly to the\nstage--\n\nMARK\nHeadcase.  Telling\nyou...'effed up headcase.\n\nBOBBY\nPeople with talent usually\nare.\n\nMatt dons his surgeon's mask -- Mark\nrolls his eyes--\n\nMARK\nOf course, there are a number\nof headcases without great\ntalent too.\n\n(35) INT/BACKSTAGE ENTRANCE/CLUB -- NIGHT\n\nMorris stands by the door surrounded by\nseveral delicious BABES.  One of them,\nwearing a tight, red dress, looks\nespecially enticing.  Morris leans in\ncloser -- her tasty breasts strain\nagainst the spandex material--\n\nMORRIS\nHoney -- don't you ever try\nand breastfeed no baby now.\n\nGIRL\nWhy not?\n\nMORRIS\nNever mind ...\n\nJerome appears--\n\nJEROME\nWhat.\n\nMORRIS\nWhat?\n\nJEROME\nRight.  What.\n\nMORRIS\nWhat??\n\nJEROME\nYou got it.\n\nBe snaps his head to the side -- Morris\nlooks, sees Vanity sitting at a table.\nHis eyes dance mischievously--\n\nMORRIS\nYe-es\n(to Girl)\nWhat time is it?\n\nGIRL\n(coyly)\nTea time.\n\nMORRIS\nSo, right.\n\n(36) INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\nas Prince sits by himself in front of\nthe mirror, staring at a cassette on the\ncounter.  We recognize it immediately as\nthe tape Jill gave him earlier,\ncontaining Lisa's and Wendy's music.  He\npicks it up, snaps it into a ghetto\nblaster.  MUSIC, without lyrics, fills\nthe room.  He adjusts the dials, sits\nback and listens a moment.  Suddenly the\ndoor opens--\n\nSTAGEHAND\nPrince, five minutes.\n\nBe snaps off the music, drops the\ncassette into his pocket, cuts out the\nroom.\n\n(37) INT.  BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT\n\nHe comes to the stage-area.  His\nBand.Members are standing about\nanxiously, watching the final moments of\nThe Modern Aires' performance.  He cuts\nbehind the curtain, peers at the\ncrowd...\n\n...his eyes fall on Vanity -- his face\nbrightens instantly.  Just then Jerome\nand Morris approach her.  Prince shakes\nhis head knowingly, offers a wry smile,\nthen joins his band.\n\n(38) INT.  VAN1TY'S TABLE AND CLUB -- NIGHT\n\nShe sits demurely.  Morris' eyes are\nwide and shining -- her beauty up close\nastonishes him--\n\nJEROME\nVanity, I'd like you to meet\nMorris E. Day.\n\nMORRIS\nHold it now -- just leave the\n'E' alone.\n\nJEROME\n(clears throat)\nVanity...this is Morris Day\n\nMORRIS\nThe pleasure's all mine.\n\nshe offers her hand -- he takes it\ndecorously--\n\nJEROME\nIf you'd excuse me.\n\nMorris signals him -- whispers into his\near--\n\nMORRIS\nToo sexy ...\n(a beat)\nHave  a waitress bring.a\nbottle of their best\nchampacne.\n\nHe seats himself, fastens her with a\nsexy, half-lidded look--\n\nMORRIS\nYour lips would make a\nlollipop too happy.\n\nVANITY\nYou think so, huh?\n\nMORRIS\nYe-es.\n\nKim appears with a bottle of champacne\nin ice--\n\nKIM\nWho's paying for this Morris?\n\nMORRIS\nI think you know that.\n(a beat)\nJerome!\n\nJerome appears, opens the bottle with a\nflair, performs a classy taste test.\nMorris pulls out some cash, pays him,\nwho snatches the money, leaves--\n\nMORRIS\nHuh, keep the change--\n\nHe whispers to Jerome--\n\nMORRIS\nGet my change, will ya?\n\nJerome leaves, Morris purses his lips--\n\nMORRIS\nOh, Lord...either somebody put\nsomething in my drink, or you\nare the finest (motherfucker)\nI've seen in ages.\n\nVANITY\nExcuse me, what did you say?\n\nMORRIS\nHuh...you look nice tonight.\n\nHe leans in, speaks with a sexy voice--\n\nMORRIS\nIt's rare that I out my cards\non the table when it comes to\nmeeting younq ladies, but ...\nI'm going to make you love me.\n\nVANITY\nIs that a  fact?\n\nHe folds his legs dramatically, his\nStacy Adams reflecting the light--\n\nMORRIS\nJust as sure as my Stacy Adams\nare shiny.\n\nJust then--\n\nM.C. (O.S.)\nLadies and Gentlemen -- please\nwelcome Prince!\n\nThe CLUB erupts in CRIES!  Prince hits\nthe stage, launches into \"G-spot,\" a\nfast, high-spirited funk tune that gets\nthe crowd hopping.  Vanity watches as\nPrince whips the crowd into a frenzy.\nMorris listens with a complacent grin on\nhis face, his eyes searching out various\nmembers of The Time who are scattered\nthrough-out the club.  When he connects\nwith one of them he makes a series of\nabsurd faces which sends them into\nhysterics.  For Prince is playing music\nthat The Time is noted for, and, as far\nas Morris is concerned, performs better.\nNot everyone in the club is dancing, or\npaying attention, and this does not\nescape his notice.\n\nSuddenly \"G-Spot\" comes to a rousing\nend.  The CROWD cheers wildly.  Prince\nmoves quickly to the piano and launches\ninto \"Electric Intercourse,\" a love\nballad which, as it progresses, becomes\na personal statement for Vanity and\nPrince himself.\n\nShe listens intently, her eyes fastened\non him.  The words have a profound\neffect on her -- and the audience.\nWithout being consciously aware of it,\nthey're moving closer to the stage,\nsearching for their personal fix. Prince\nsurrenders himself to the music totally,\nreleasing from himself all that is\nhurtful -- releasing the sincerity and\ntruthfulness that escapes him in his\ndaily life.  We are entering  realm\nwhere life and music are inextricably\nbound, and the impact on the performer\nand listener is profound.\n\nHe's directing his music toward her, and\nshe receives it gratefully, almost\nanxiously.  It fills a void in her, hewn\nby a life of meaningless promises.  He\nsearches her face with his magnificent\neyes, and ends the song with a\nheartrending cry which connects with the\nsouls of all present.  Everyone is\npaying attention now.\n\nThe stage is plunged into darkness.  The\nCROWD goes CRAZY!  Vanity applauds\nvigorously, wipes the tears from her\neyes.  Morris, who was more affected by\nthe performance than he'd care to admit,\ndoesn't like what he sees and searches\nfor a winning line--\n\nMORRIS\nHe doesn't like girls.\n\nShe's equal to the challenge--\n\nVANITY\nI know -- he likes women.\n\nBut Morris can barely suppress a smile,\nand settles himself comfortably into his\nchair -- for he knows what Vanity has\nlost...at least this round--\n\nMORRIS\nWell ... he don't do too good\nwith them either.\n\nShe flashes him a quizzical look -- he\nsimply smiles.\n\n(39) INT.  BACKSTAGE HALLIIAY -- NIGHT\n\nJubilation time!  Prince and his Band\nmove through the hallway briskly, past\nthe outstretched arms of admiring fans.\nThere's a lot of back-slapping going on\nas the Musicians bask in the glow of\nwell-wishers.  Prince moves past Billy\nSparks, who has an angry look on his\nface--\n\nBILLY\nWhat's this intercourse, shit?\n\nPRINCE\nHey; man -- don't worry about\nit.\n\nBILLY\nI'm warning you...\n\nBut Prince ignores him, cuts into the\ndressing room--\n\n(40) INT.  DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n--then stops suddenly, surprised.  He's\nmuzzle to muzzle with a cuddly DOG, held\nup lovingly by Jill--\n\nJILL\nSurprise!\n\nOOHS! and AAHS!  by  the entire group.\nJill hesitates, then kisses Prince's\ncheek compulsively.  He's surprised,\ntouched--\n\nPRINCE\nHey -- wait till we're\nmarried, now.\n\nShe fidgets, her face blushes red.\nWendy is studying the dog--\n\nWENDY\nOh, my God -- look at this!\n\nEveryone looks -- Jill grins like the\nCheshire Cat--\n\nJILL\nNotice anything?\n\nPRINCE\nWhat?\n\nWENDY\nIt looks like you!\n\nShe thrusts the dog into his arms -- the\nBand laughs uproariously.  Jill is\nbeaming--\n\nJILL\nHis hair ...\n\nPrince gazes into the mirror -- and sure\nenough the dog's hair has been groomed\nto match his.  He can't help smiling--\n\nPRINCE\nShit ...\n\nJILL\n(softly)\nI wanted to cheer you up.\n\nPRINCE\nThanks.\n\nMATT\nI'm hungry -- where's the\nfood?!\n\nHe grabs the dog, 'a la The Werewolf,\nstarts chomping on it's neck.  The Group\nbusts up, starts fooling around.\n\nPrince glances into the mirror -- Vanity\nis there.  He whirls around to the door\n-- nothing.  A huge smile sweeps his\nface instead.  The Band continues\nfooling around, and Prince joins in with\na relish.\n\n(41) EXT.  ALLEYWAY #2, REAR CLUB -- NIGHT\n\nVanity leans against a brick wall,\nhiding in the shadows.  Suddenly\nFOOTSTEPS approach.  Prince appears,\ngets on his Motorcycle--\n\nVANITY\nHey...\n\nHe doesn't look up--\n\nPRINCE\nWe have to go to your place.\n\nVANITY\nWhat for?\n\nPRINCE\nI want to show you something.\n\nShe's embarrassed by her apartment--\n\nVANITY\nNo...no, we can't.\n\nPRINCE\nWhy -- is there someone there?\n\nVANITY\nWhy do you always think\nthere's somebody else?\n\nHe averts his eyes -- kick STARTS his\nbike--\n\nPRINCE\nLet's go.\n\nVANITY\n(Getting on)\nYeah -- but we're not going to\nmy place.\n\nHe remains silent, snaps the bike into\ngear, blasts down the ally into the\nstreet.\n\n(42) PRINCE'S HOUSE AND STREET -- NIGHT\n\nPrince and Vanity whip down a\nresidential street.  As he approaches\nhis house he slows, moves past it\nquietly.\n\nHe makes a deft U-turn, crosses his\nhouse again -- seems to be listening\nintently...\n\nAfter a moment, he cuts down a narrow\npath, turns up a back alley.  He rides\nto a wooden gate, detaches a hidden\nlever.  The wood slats rotate like a\ngarage door -- Prince coaxes his bike\nthrough.\n\nBACKYARD\n\nVanity's mesmerized.  They ride down a\nnarrow sidewalk, cut through a garden,\nand emerge from the back of a garage.\nHe leans his bike against it--\n\nVANITY\nThat was a grand entrance.\nWhere am I?\n\nHe silences her with a look, moves\nquickly across the grass, comes to a\nwindow.  He stands on a pipe, looks in--\n\n(43) PRINCE'S POV -- INT.  LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\nHis Mother and Father in the living\nroom.  His Mother is sprawled out on the\nsofa, obviously drunk, her dress hiked\nalong her thighs.  Her head rests in his\nFather's lap.\n\n(44) EXT.  BACKYARD -- NIGHT\n\nPrince hops from the pipe, leans coolly\nagainst the house. Intrigued. Vanity\nlooks in--\n\n(45) VANITY'S POV -- INT.  LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\nThe mother and father kissing\ntentatively, then violently, finally\npulling away.  The Mother seems to be\ntaunting the Father, coaxing him into a\ntrap.  He kisses her mouth lustily --\nshe pulls back snarling--.\n\n(46) EXT.  BACKYARD -- NIGHT\n\nVanity's scared -- tries to be cool--\n\nVANITY\nSo -- friends of yours?\n\nPRINCE\nYeah -- the freak show.\n\nHe walks off.  She jumps off the pipe,\nfollows.\n\nSIDE OF HOUSE\n\nas they emerge around the corner.\nPrince squats by a basement window,\nadjusts an old coal chute, then slides\ndown it--\n\nVANITY\nHey...\n\nPRINCE (O.S.)\nC'mon.\n\nShe hesitates a moment, then slides down\ntoo.\n\n(47) INT.  BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOME -- NIGHT\n\nHe turns on a LIGHT, disappears into an\nADJOINING ROOM.  Vanity looks around\namazed.  She stands in a small ANTE-\nCHAMBER whose walls are covered with\nthicks pads and foam.\n\nColorful MOBILES hang suspended from the\nceilings -- various INSTRUMENTS lie\nabout: a drumset, an electric guitar,\nand a small upright piano.  A stereo and\ncassette player. are perched on a shelf,\nand  two speakers are recessed into the\nwalls.  The entire room looks hand-\nbuilt, the wood carefully painted, or\nstained.\n\nShe peers through the doorway into the\nadjoining room.  BLUE MOONLIGHT filters\nin through the casement windows.\nVarious MURALS are painted on the walls,\nMOBILES are suspended from the ceiling.\nA bed sits in the middle of the floor, a\nvanity table and mirror nearby.\n\nShe stands idly a mement, then moves\naround the antechamber.  Various\nKNICKNACKS catch her attention. Small\nwind-up TOYS lie about:  a soldier, a\nbear banging on a drum, a tractor and\ncar.  A small MUSIC BOX sits on a shelf.\nShe turns the handle, a little TUNE\nfills the room...\n\nA cassette sits in the player.  She\nsnaps it shut, hits the play button.  A\nDRUM BEAT fills the room, followed by a\nWOMAN'S VOICE, seemingly speaking in a\nforeign tongue.  The combination is\nhypnotic and sensual -- she finds\nherself drawn in ...\n\nSuddenly Prince grabs her by the waist,\nlets out a SHRIEK.  She draws a out\nbreath, jumps--\n\nVANITY\nIf you think you scared me,\nyou didn't.\n\nPRINCE\nOh, yeah ...\n\nHe puts his index finger directly in\nfront of her nose, moves it back and\nforth hypnotically.  She follows it\nearnestly with her eyes.  Suddenly, he\npulls his hand away, stretches it to the\nceiling like an escaping bird.  They\nboth smile, lock eyes.  Passion rings in\ntheir veins...\n\nThe Woman's VOICE begins to moan deeply,\npleasurably--\n\nVANITY\nWho's the lucky girl?  Sounds\nlike she was having a good\ntime.\n\nPRINCE\nShe's crying -- it's\nbackwards.  It makes me sad\nwhen I hear it.  It sorta\nsounds like she's laughing,\ndoesn't it?\n\nVANITY\nSo what did you do to her? Do\nyou always treat your women\nlike that?\n\nPRINCE\nI don't have anybody right\nnow.\n\nHeat floods into her womb like soft fire-\n-\n\nVANITY\nYou look pretty...\n\nShe touches his chest delicately, fluffs\nup his hair--\n\nVANITY\nKing Kong?\n\nPRINCE\nStop.\n\nShe hesitates -- but he reaches out\ntentatively, touches her breast--\n\nVANITY\nNo.\n\nBut their mutual desire is too strong.\nTheir lips seek one another out timidly,\nalmost deferentially...then fervently.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n(48) INT.  BEDROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT\n\nVanity sits at the foot of the bed,\nPrince stands before her.  Her dress is\nhiked along her thighs, her stockings\nattached to garters.  Their hands search\ndelicately across the contours of their\nbodies, drawing quick breaths from their\nlips.  They kiss one another ardently,\nthen quickly, like sparrows pecking\nseed.  She goes to remove her dress, but\nPrince stays her with a gesture, moving\nhis hands along her thighs, touching\ndelicately that spot between her legs.\nA low, whispery moan escapes from her\nlips.\n\nVanity lies back, drawing Prince toward\nher.  His lips move across her mouth,\nher neck, her breasts.  She moans\nsoftly, pulls her dress above her\nthighs, goes to remove it.  Once again\nhe stops her, slowly turns her onto her\nstomach.\n\nShe stands.on her knees, her head\nresting on a pillow.  His hands move up\nalong the back of her thighs, past the\ngarters to her panties.  He tugs at them\ngently, then rubs his hand firmly\nbetween her legs.  She moans suddenly,\nthe shudder moving through her like a\nwhirlwind ...\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n(49) INT.  BEDROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT\n\nMOONLIGHT glows throuch the casement\nwindows.  MOBILES stir gently in the\nnight breeze.\n\nPrince and Vanity are asleep.  He rests\non his side, his hands gently surporting\nhis face.  She lies behind him, one leg\ndangling off the bed, one shoe discarded\non the floor\n\nSuddenly a distant MOAN...QUICK\nFOOTSTEPS -- A DOOR SLAMS.  Vanity SNAPS\nawake! Fear sweeps her like a shadow\nfrom a passing cloud.  She listens\nintently, then--\n\n-- Another DOOR SLAM, QUICK FOOTSTEPS,\nand Prince's Mother\nCRYING in the dark--\n\nMOTHER\n(o.s.)\n(upstairs)\nPlease!\n\nA bottle CRASHES to the floor.  Then\nsilence...\n\n...deep silence like snow in the room...\n\nVanity's racked with fear.  She sits up\nslowly, her eyes searching out Prince --\nhe's sleeping...\n\nSuddenly more FOOTSTEPS, a DOOR SLAMS and the\nFather's CRY--\n\nFATHER\n(o.s.)\nNo!!\n\nWHACK!  Something heavy CRASHES to the\nfloor...\n\nVanity rises from the bed in a panic!\nShe smoothes down her dress, searches\nfor her other shoe.  She shoots another\nlook to Prince, but he sleeps\npeacefully.  Casting a glance upstairs,\nshe climbs throuch the casement window,\ndisappears into the night.\n\nPRINCE is resting on his side, his eyes\nopened.\n\n(50)  EXT. PRINCE'S HOUSE AND STREET -- NIGHT\n\nVanity moves quickly along the side of\nthe house, trying desperately to find\nher wav.  Suddenly a HAND reaches out of\nthe darkness, GRABS her by the throat.\nShe SCREAMS, swings her bag desperately\n-- something CRASHES, into the bushes--\n\nVOICE\nDamn, baby, hold it!

The CADDY is parked at the\ncurb.  Jerome leans against it, reading\na newspaper--\n\nVANITY\nHi, Jerome.  Wow!  Nice\nhubcaps.\n\nHe grins proudly from ear to ear -- the\nCaddy sports new chrome wire wheels--\n\nJEROME\nYou like them, huh?\n\nVANITY\nBeautiful.\n\nMorris MOANS dismally--\n\nMORRIS\nJerome...you think these can\nbe fixed?\n\nHis shoes are badly scuffed, the leather\ntorn across the top--\n\nJEROME\nI think they're dead, man.\n\nVANITY\nGod, I'm sorry.\n\nMORRIS\nShit -- it's so rough out\nhere.\n\nJust then a PATROL CAR cruises by.

Morris and Vanity sit in\nthe backseat. He gazes at her ardently--\n\nMORRIS\nJerome!\n\nJerome snaps a look in the rear-view --\nMorris gives him a deft nod. Jerome\nopens the glove compartment, searches\nthrough the cassette tapes. He finds the\none he wants, snaps it into the player.\nRESTAURANT AMBIANCE fills the car...\n\nNote:  The restaurant ambiance will grow\nin volume, and will be followed by\nexaggerated dinner music, punctuated\nwith strings and delicate cymbals.  The\nMUSIC plays throughout this scene -- and\nMorris times his words to the ebb and\nflow of the piece to insure the proper\ndramatic effect.\n\n...dinner MUSIC begins--\n\nJEROME\nCocktails before dinner?\n\nMORRIS\nYes -- two pi\u00f1a coladas.\n\nVANITY\nUh...make mine a virgin.\n\nJEROME\nOkay...\n\nJerome braces his knees against the\nwheel, pours two premixed coladas into\nplastic glasses--\n\nJEROME\n(to Morris)\nWill you be having a virgin as\nwell?\n\nMORRIS\nYe-es!  For dessert!!\nWhawhak!\n\nJerome stifles a laugh, pours a rum\nminiature into Morris' glass.  He hands\nthem back--\n\nMORRIS\nThank you.  Here you are,\ndear.\n\nThey savor their drinks -- Morris'\nfervor grows by leaps and bounds--\n\nMORRIS\nJerome, uh, get your pad and\npencil, I think it's gonna be\nkinda right.  If my judge of\ncharacter is correct, it's\ngoing to be about loving\ntonight.\n(a beat)\nStop me when I get to\nseventeen.\n\nJerome places a pad by his side, pencil\nat the ready. He settles the Caddy to a\ncruising 55 -- Morris looks deeply into\nVanity's eyes--\n\nMORRIS\nExcuse me, baby...I bet you\ndidn't know I had a piece of\nthis restaurant, did you?\n(a beat)\nMay I taste that?\n\nHe takes Vanity's drink, slurps a\nlittle, burps--\n\nMORRIS\nHuh, excuse me, that's kind of\nweak...here, try mine.\n\nShe does, and begins coughing violently-\n-\n\nVANITY\nGood God!\n\nMORRIS\nY'know...they say that saliva\nis an aphrodisiac.\n(a beat)\nYou look so lovely tonight.\n\nVANITY\n(couching)\nWhy...thank you.\n\nMORRIS\nProbably you'd look better\nunder exotic...red...liqhts.\n(another though)\nI wish you could see my home.\nIt's...it's so exciting.\n\nHe leans close to her, speaks in a soft,\nsexy voice--\n\nMORRIS\nIn my bedroom, I have a brass\nwaterbed ...\n\nVANITY\nOooh!\n\nMORRIS\nI have an Italian cook, Gino\nIzogochograchi, or something\nlike that.\n\nShe giggles, looks at him deeply--\n\nMORRIS\nIt's funny...your eyes -- when\nyou stare at me like that, it\ncauses my stomach to qui-\nquiver.  Oh, Lord...\n\nAn idea flashes across his mind--\n\nMORRIS\nDo you like diamonds?\n\nVANITY\nUh, huh.\n\nMORRIS\nYeah ...?\n\nVANITY\nYeah.\n\nMORRIS\nI know it's rather masculine,\nbut -- try this one on.\n\nHe slides a large glass diamond on her\nfinger--\n\nVANITY\nOhhh!\n\nMORRIS\nMy God, darling it fits.\n\nHe studies her hands closely--\n\nMORRIS\nYou must have strong hands,\nbut -- they're so soft...like\noils in my bubble bath.\n(a beat)\nDamn ...\n\nHe leans close to her--\n\nMORRIS\nDarling...?\n\nVANITY\nYeah...?\n\nMORRIS\nI'm not usually so forward,\nbut -- would you like to make\nlove to me?  I can make it so\nnice ...\n\nShe giggles freely, looks at him with\nbig eyes--\n\nMORRIS\nDo you know what is meant by\nthe words, huh, I hate to use\nthem, they're so harsh, so\nAmerican...I mean, and yet on\nthe other hand, they're\nexciting words.  The words...\n(pause)\n...chili sauce.  Oh, Lord.\n(a beat)\n\nMORRIS\nYou know, I haven't made love\nin so long, but with you I\nknow it would be just like\nriding a bike.  I'd remember\neverything I've ever learned.\n(a beat)\nBaby, if the kid can't make\nyou come, nobody can.\n\nJerome checks off his pad--\n\nJEROME\n(whispers)\nMorris..!\n\nMORRIS\nYeah...?\n\nJEROME\nSeventeen.\n\nMorris fixes Vanity with his half-\nlidded, pouty-lip look--\n\nMORRIS\nHuh, what's it gonna to be\nbaby?\n\nShe's on the spot, thinks fast--\n\nVANITY\nPULL OVER THERE!\n\nMORRIS\nWhat?!\n\nJEROME\nWhat?!\n\nVANITY\nOver there -- that's where I\nlive.\n\nJerome SKIDS the car to a stop.  They're\ndirectly in front of a slick, hi-rise\napartment building--\n\nMORRIS\nHere...?\n\nVANITY\nYes.\n\nMORRIS\nUh, what one is it?\n\nVANITY\nThat one, right there, see?\nOn the 14th floor.\n\nMORRIS\nIt's nice, huh?\n\nVANITY\nOh, it's great.

C'mon!\n(a beat)\nOkay -- where are you taking\nme?\n\nMORRIS\nHome.\n(smiling)\nYou and me are a lot alike.- I\nlike that.  So, I'd like to\nhelp you out.  I think I have\nsomething you may be\ninterested,  in.\n\nVANITY\nOh yeah -- what?\n\nJerome hands Morris a cassette -- Morris\nwaves it in front of her nose--\n\nMORRIS\nA little song and dance.  That\nis, if you can sing and dance.\n\nVANITY\n(defensively)\nPrince is goinq to help me.\n\nJerome and Moris suppress their laughter-\n-\n\nJEROME\nMotherfucker needs a haircut.\n\nMORRIS\nHee, hee, uh, excuse me.

He's never done\nanything in his whole life for\nanybody but himself.\n\nVANITY\nGuys better than you have\npromised me things before.\n\nMORRIS\nI know that's right, but--\n\nJerome hands him a card with an address\non it.  Morris hands the card to her--\n\nMORRIS\n(con't)\n-- not Morris Day.\n(he smiles)\n\nJerome pulls up in front of her motel.\nVanity reads the card--\n\nMORRIS\nCome by any time.\n\n(53)  EXT. MOTEL/INT. CADDY -- TWILIGHT\n\nShe gets out of the car, stands on the\nsidewalk.  Morris pushes the window\nbutton -- nothing happens--\n\nMORRIS\nJerome!\n\nJerome leans over, taps the glass -- the\nwindow glides down--\n\nMORRIS\n(to Vanity)\nOne more thing ...\n\nJerome snaps the glove compartment,\nhands Morris a neatly folded camisole.\nMorris presents it to her--\n\nMORRIS\nHere's a little something for\nyou.  If you get cold when you\nwear it, call me.\n\nHe snaps his fingers -- Jerome pulls the\nCaddy away with a screech.\n\n(54) EXT. VANITY'S MOTEL -- TWILIGHT\n\nVanity stands on the sidewalk a moment,\nslightly bewildered and very amused.\nShe watches the Cadillac screech around\nthe bend.

VANITY'S ROOM -- DAWN\n\nShe goes inside, drops the tape and card\nin her bureau. unfolding the camisole,\nshe holds it against her, gazes into the\nmirror.  It looks beautiful.  Suddenly a\nKNOCK at the door--\n\nVANITY\nMorris...?\n\nAnother two KNOCKS, something like a\nconfirmation.  She smiles, cuts to the\ndoor, flings it open -- but Prince is\nthere. She's shocked, but recovers\ninstantly--\n\nVANITY\nI had a feeling it was you --\nI knew it!  It's amazing -- I\ncould tell it was you.\n\nHis face remains placid as he puts on\nhis sunglasses--\n\nPRINCE\nHow'd you get home?\n\nVANITY\nTook a cab.\n\nPRINCE\nOh yeah?  Where'd you get\nthat?\n\nShe stares at the camisole in her hands-\n-\n\nVANITY\nI adore camisoles.\n\nHe nods dispassionately, walks into the\nroom, gives the place the once over,\nthen--\n\nPRINCE\nLet's ride.\n\n(56)  EXT.

WOODS AND STREAM -- DAWN\n\nPRINCE AND VANITY ride cautiously\nthrough a series of hiking paths, then\ntwist down a small embankment.  A STREAM\nflows before them.

It\nreminds me of where I grew up.\nMy father used to ...\n\nHe waits for an answer, it's not\nforthcoming--\n\nPRINCE\nYour father used to what...?\n\nVANITY\nNothing...it's just...\n(changes subject)\nYou must like places like\nthis.\n\nHe goes to the stream, balances on\nseveral rocks, moves to the other side.\nThe stream flows between them--\n\nVANITY\nSo, have you reconsidered my\nproposal?\n\nPRINCE\nWhat...?\n\nVANITY\nWhat we talked about last\ntime.\n\nPRINCE\nYou can't be serious.\n\nShe starts a little dance step, climaxes\nit with spins and twirls--\n\nVANITY\nOh, come on -- you know you\nreally want to.  You've been\nwaiting for this opportunity\n...all...your...life...\n\nHe can't help laughing -- she freezes,\nlooks at him coldly--\n\nPRINCE\nI'm sorry -- excuse me.\n\nVANITY\nGod -- so why do you come\naround?  You don't want to\nhelp me, not that you have to.\nYou don't want to sleep with\nme, not that you have to do\nthat either.  So why am I\nhere?\n\nHe smiles, walks off--\n\nVANITY\nThere's a lot of things you\ndon't know about me.  You'd be\nsurprised how many things I\ncould do.\n\nHe disappears around some trees--\n\nVANITY\nTake me home immediately!  I\nwant to go home.  I can't\nstand this!  I can't take this\nanymore!  Prince!\n\nPRINCE moves through the trees smiling,\nstudying nature--\n\nVANITY(O.S.)\nI don't need this!  I was\ndoing alright before I met\nyou.  Motherfucker, you need a\nhaircut!\n\nHe comes to a tree, leans against it\ncontentedly, studies the foliage.\n\nVANITY paces back and forth frantically\nalong the stream--\n\nVANITY\n(to herself)\nI don't get this.\n(yells)\nPrince! Who do you think you\nare?!  You don't care.  You\ndon't care about anything!  I\nnever wanted you to help me\nanyway!\n\nPRINCE rests by the tree, observes TWO\nHIKERS walking down the path toward him-\n-\n\nVANITY (0.S.)\nYou think you're a good\nmusician?!

I shouldn't have\nsaid those things.  Will you\nforgive me?\n\nPRINCE\n(softly)\nYes.\n\nHe takes the flower, slips it into his\njacket, kisses her forehead.\n\n(60) EXT. GLADE AND BARN -- DAWN\n\nas they ride down a leaf-strewn path and\npull to a stop near an old, weathered,\ndilapidated BARN.  It stands laarge and\nsilent like a painting.

It begins to RAIN.\n\nVanity stands in the middle of the barn,\ngazing at the storm.  Beads of\nperspiration glisten on her forehead.\nShe turns slowly, watches as Prince\nretrieves old blankets from a nearby\nstall.  Their eyes search one another\nout, their breathing becomes short,\nexpectant.  She hesitates a moment, then\npulls off her blouse, discards it to the\nmoist, dusty floor.\n\n(62)  INT. BARN -- DAY\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\nRAIN patters srtongly against the barn.\nA deep THUNDER rolls.  She's on top of\nhim, moving deliciously, her body\nglowing in the purple, dawn light.\nMoist, purple water shadows streak and\ncourse her skin as she moves slowly,\nthen deliberately against him.  He\nwatches her avidly,  his hands firmly on\nher thighs, and thrusts into her again\nand again...and again.\n\n(62A)  EXT.

STREETS, VANITY'S MOTEL -- MORNING\n\nThe STREETS glisten with the rain.\nPrince and Vanity pull up in front of\nher motel.

She watches him a\nmoment, her eyes glowing.  She heads to\nher motel, then stops short -- a single\nCARNATION lies oon the sidewalk.  She\nlooks around quickly, almost expecting\nsomeone to claim it.  But no one's\naround, so she picks it up, goes inside.\n\n(64) INT. STAIRWELL, VANITY'S MOTEL -- MORNING\n\nShe enters the LOBBY, closes the door\nbehind her.  She turns -- another\nCARNATION is on the stairwell.  She's\nintrigued, glances up the stairs --\nthere's another one, and yet another\nfurther up.  She's confused, but grabs\nthem, disappears up the stairs.\n\nHALLWAY\nas she comes to a halt outside her room,\npicking up carnations along the way.\nShe opens her door, cuts inside.\n\n(65) INT. VANIITY'S ROOM -- MORNING\n\nShe goes into the bathroom, fills the\nsink with water, arranges the flowers\nwithin.  She smiles radiantly -- they\nlook beautiful.  Suddenly something\nseizes her thoughts.  She opens her\nbureau drawer quickly, pulls out the\nyellow pages, leafs through it\nhurriedly, We READ: Parking, Passport,\nPaving...then Pawnbrokers.  She stops,\nruns her finger down the page, then\nhunts quickly through her drawer.  Her\neyes dance mischievously when she pulls\nout her gold chain.  She places it on\nher bureau, hurries to her clothes rack.\nSuddenly, a quick KNOCK at the door--\n\nMAN(O.S.)\nMiss V.?\n\nShe looks around the corner -- a flower\ndelivery MAN stands in the hallway,\nholding a bouquet of roses--\n\nVANITY\nYes...?\n\nMAN\nDelivery.\n\nVANITY\n(surprised)\nCome in ...\n\nHe cuts inside, and is followed by\nanother MAN, holding a bouquet of\ndaisies--\n\nVANITY\nHey -- wait a minute.

They\nstand expectantly a long time.  Finally\nJerome looks at Morris--\n\nJEROME\nWell...what do you think?\n\nMorris is staring intently at the window\n-- he purses his lips sensualy--\n\nMORRIS\nChili sauce.\n\nJust then Vanity steps outside, looks\nstunning in her tight, black pants and\nboots.  Her eyes dance vivaciously, a\nred sash is tied around her waste.\nMorris gives Jerome his sexy, half-\nlidded, pouty-lip look--\n\nMORRIS\nOh, Lord...\n\n(68) INT. CLUB (1ST AVE. ST.

Wendy plays\nguitar, her back to Prince.  Lisa, at\nthe keyboards, spots him and stops--\n\nWENDY\nWhat's wrong?\n\nLisa points to Prince.

We See: 8:15.\n\nPrince sits, on his bed, staring at the\nclock, seemingly lost in thoucht.  He\ngets up, rummages through his coat\npockets, pulls out Lisa's and Wendy's\ntape.  He snaps it into the player,\nsettles back.\n\nMUSIC fills the room.  He listens\nintently a moment, his face placid.  He\ncloses his eyes, tries to relax ...\n\nSuddenly a DOOR SLAMS in the far reaches\nof the house.  Harsh FOOTSTEPS echo\nthrough the upstairs hallway.  Prince\nremains still, his eyes closed...\n\nThen another deathly DOOR SLAM!  GLASS\ndissolves in its frame and trickles to\nthe floor like icicles.  Resentment\nsurges in him like a tornado.  He rises\npurposefully, turns the MUSIC up...\n\n...And then his door SMASHES open and\nhis Mother LUNGES into the room in a\nPANIC.  She flings herself onto his bed\nas his Father streaks in and WHACKS!\nWHACKS!

His Mother buries her head in the\npillow, choking back sobs--\n\nMOTHER\nI'm just trapped here...\n\nHis Father's eyes well with tears.  He\nleans close to her, speaks softly--\n\nFATHER\nYou always got a roof\noverhead...\n\nMOTHER\nYou don't let me have any\nfun...\n\nHis Father sighs wearily, pulls himself\nto his feet.  He moves to the door--\n\nFATHER\nI could make you happy.  Just\nbelieve in me...\n\nMOTHER\nYou never...\n\nFATHER\nI would die for you.\n\nHe leaves the room, closes the door\nbehind him.\n\nPRINCE stares at  the door a moment,\ntears welling in his eyes.  His Mother\nis motionless, whimpering softly.  A\nscent of liquor permeates the air.\n\nHe moves toward her, reaches out\ntentatively...\n\nSuddenly she jumps up, starts pacing\nfranticaily--\n\nMOTHER\nIt's nice here.  It's a nice\nhouse.  Nothing wrong.\n(a beat)\nIt's a good family.  Believe\nme, I know.  Nothing wrong\nhere.\n(a beat)\nYour father is okay.  He's a\ngood man.  You could learn\nsomthing.\n\nShe catches a glimpse of herself in the\nmirror, stops--\n\nMOTHER\nMy, my!  Don't you think I\nhave a good figure?  Your\nFather did.\n\nShe sits in front of the mirror, studies\nher face, her eyes...her breasts--\n\nMOTHER\nI was beautiful when your Dad\nmet me.  I was out-a-sight!\n\nShe giggles, starts applying makeup--\n\nMOTHER\nI looked just like a movie\nstar.  The minute he saw me\nsinging, I knew just what he\nwanted.\n\nShe fixes him with a conspiratorial\nlook, whispers--\n\nMOTHER\nHe wanted to get into my\npanties.\n\nShe makes funny, \"jazzy\" eyes at him,\nthen stops suddenly, staring.  His face,\nmouth, eyes...a sudden stirring in her\nloins.  Her lips part, she moistens them\nunconsciously...\n\nShe turns from the mirror and stares at\nhim -- his look connects with her groin.\nShe rises suddenly, walks slowly toward\nthe bed, sits facing him--\n\nMOTHER\nYou look so pretty.  Just like\nme, honey.  You coulda been a\ngirl.\n\nShe outlines the mole on his cheek with\na makeup pencil, then draws one on\nherself.  She takes her earring off, and\nputs it on his ear.  They are face to\nface -- identical--\n\nMOTHER\nSo pretty...\n\nShe looks at him drunkenly.  He tries to\nhold it in, but can't.  A tear, hot and\nhard as a bullet flows down his cheek.\nShe puts her index finger in front of\nhis face, moves it back and forth\nhypnotically.   Suddenly she pulls her\nhand away, stretches it to the ceiling\nlike an escaping bird.  He swallows,\ntries to smile -- she leans close --\n\nMOTHER\n(secretly)\nI have to go now, see some\nfriends.  Don't tell your\nfather, okay?\n\nShe gets up, leaves the room--\n\nMOTHER\nBye, skipper...bye.\n\n(71) EXT. PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT (LATER)\n\nVanity climbs over a fence, moves\nthrough some bushes, emerges along side\nPrince's house.  She has an excited,\nravenous look on her face.  She hurries\nto the casement window, climbs into the\nbasement.\n\n(72) INT. PRINCE'S BEDROObt -- NIGHT\n\nShe drops down into the basement, turns\nexcitedly, leaps into Prince's arms--\n\nVANITY\nI missed you!  Missed you!\nMissed you!\n\nShe hugs him tight, showers him with\nkisses, topples them both to the bed.\nLaughing, hugging, kissing -- fast and\nfurious.  Suddenly she jumps up like a\npanther, fluffs her hair wildly in the\nmirror, fixes him with a wanton look.\nHis eyes devour her--\n\nPRINCE\nCome here.  Where were you?\n\nShe moistens her lips, walks\nlasciviously toward the bed, sits facing\nhim.  She laughs suddenly, pushes him\nback...and they're at each other again -\n- faces two inches apart;  touching,\nwhispering, kissing, hands searching --\nshutting out the rocm, shutting out the\nworld...\n\nShe jumps up suddenly.  She can't be\ncontained!  She practically levitates--\n\nVANITY\nI have a big surprise for you.\n\nShe rushes to the coal chute, climbs\nhalfway through.  Prince, puzzled,\ncracks up watching her ass and legs\ndangling.  She drops back into the room,\nholding a large PACKAGE.  His eyes\nwiden.  She struts to the bed, lays it\ndown majestically before him--\n\nVANITY\n(sings)\nDa...da..!\n\nPRINCE\nWhat is it?\n\nVANITY\nOpen it.\n\nHe starts peeling the tape off, careful\nnot to rip the paper.  Vanity's bursting\nwith excitement though, and demolishes\nit in a flash!  He laughs, opens the lid\n-- stares in shock--\n\nPRINCE\nOh, no...\n(happy)\nOh, no!\n\nHe pulls out a gleaming new GUITAR, and\nwe immediately recognize it as the one\nthey saw in the window. He's deliriously\nhappy, and speechless--\n\nPRINCE\nHow'd you do it?\n\nShe shouts with delight, attacks him\nagain, pushing the guitar aside.  Fast,\nfurious kisses and he responds in kind.\nThey're twisted in a heap on the bed.\nAfter a moment they come up for air,\nstare at each other playfully. Something\nflashes across his mind--\n\nPRINCE\nHere...\n\nHer eyes widen.  He takes off his\nMother's earring, fastens it to her ear.\nEyes dancing, she jumps up, studies it\nclosely, in the mirror--\n\nVANITY\nI love it!\n\nShe twists around, kneels beside him,\nshowers him with bites and kisses.\nSuddenly she stops--\n\nVANITY\nI'm going to join Morris'\ngroup.\n\nHis face  drops, shocked--\n\nPRINCE\nWhat?\n\nShe backs away from  him, stands,\nstrikes a defensive stance--\n\nVANITY\nI'm going to join Morris'\ngroup.\n\nHe LUNGES savagely before he knows it!\nHis hand lashes out, SMASHES her in the\nface.  She falls back, CRASHES into the\nmirror.  She slips dully to the floor,\ntries desperately to brace herself on a\nchair--\n\nHe's horrified--\n\nPRINCE\nI'm sorry!  Oh, baby, I'm\nsorry! Are you alright?\n\nHe helps her up, she turns away from him-\n-\n\nVANITY\nJust...leave me alone.\n\nHis heart staggers in his chest--\n\nPRINCE\nPlease...it's just...\n(a beat)\nI don't want you around this\nat all.  I just don't want you\nin my life this way.  You\ndon't have to prove anything\nto me or anybody else.\n(a beat)\nVanity...?  Don't I make you\nhappy?  Don.t you like the way\nwe are?\n(another thought)\nDo you know Morris?  Do you\nknow what he's about? He\ndoesn't care about you.\n\nShe  twists viciously--\n\nVANITY\nJealous..?!\n\nShe rushes into the antechamber, climbs\nthrough the coal chute, disappears into\nthe night.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n(73) INT. CLUB -- MORNING\n\nMatt, Bobby and Mark are JAMMING\nonstage.  Prince emerges from behind the\ncurtains.  He looks drawn.and haggard,\nhis face unshaven.  The Guys spot him,\nand the MUSIC trickles to a stop.\nTension fills the room in an instant.\nMark glances at his watch, fixes Prince\nwith a disgusted look.\n\nPrince climbs the steps to the stage,\ncuts across it--\n\nPRINCE\nWhere's Lisa and Wendy?\n\nBOBBY\nThey haven't shown up yet.\n\nPRINCE\nThey call?\n\nThe Guys shrug, look away.  Prince\nsimmers a moment, straps on his guitar -\n- immediately gets ear-splitting\nFEEDBACK.  He stomps on the floor pedals\nangrily.  Just then Chick comes up to\nthe stage--\n\nCHICK\nPrince.  Billy Sparks wants to\nsee you.\n\nPRINCE\nTell him I'm rehearsing.\n\nCHICK\nUh, uh -- now.\n\n(74) INT. STAIRWAY AND CLUB -- DAY\n\nas Billy cuts down the stairs quickly.\nPrince, walking to meet him, pulls\nhimself up short--\n\nBILLY\nWhat do you want?\n\nPRINCE\nYou wanted to see me?\n\nBilly still moves -- Prince keeps up--\n\nBILLY\nYou having trouble?\n\nPRINCE\n(shrugs)\nNo.\n\nBILLY\nNo?\n\nPRINCE\nNo ...\n\nBILLY\nWhere's Lisa and Wendy?\n\nHe stops abruptly at the front door,\nstudies Prince for a long time.  Then he\ncuts outside.  Prince follows.\n\n(75) EXT. STREETS, CLUB -- DAY\n\nRush hour TRAFFIC.  Billy sets the pace\ndown the sidewalk -- Prince keeps up--\n\nBILLY\nMorris called me this morning.\nSeems he's got himself a new\ngroup called Vanity Six.  You\nknow anything about them?\n\nPRINCE\n(a beat)\nNo.\n\nBILLY\nHe tells me they're great.\nThinks I'll be interested.\nThat's cool, but now I've got\na problem.\n\nPRINCE\nWhat's that?\n\nBILLY\nI book three acts -- I can't\nafford four.  If they're as\ngood as Morris says they are,\none of you will have to go...\n\nSuddenly a HORN BLARES off screen.\nBilly looks up -- a BEAUTIFUL BABE in a\nblack BMW waves--\n\nBILLY\nGo around the block!\n\nThe Babe pulls into the flow of traffic-\n-\n\nBILLY\nIt won't be The Time --\nthey're playing backup to\nVanity.  So it's either you or\nthe Modern Aires.\n(a beat)\nWhat would You do in my\nposition?\n\nPrince has a sinking feeling in his gut-\n-\n\nBILLY\n(musing)\nI like the Modern Aires.  They\nhave a good following -- they\nshow up for practice -- and\nthe kids like all their music.\n\nThe BMW sweeps up to the curb.  Billy\nopens the door, slides in--\n\nBILLY\n'Nough said.  Get smart.\nStraighten up your shit.\n\n(76) INT. REHEARSAL HALL -- DAY\n\nThe PLACE is JUMPING!  Once again The\nTime is deep in the guts of \"Sex\nShooter,\" but now there's a difference.\nThe MUSIC is fiercer and crisper -- the\nBEAT tailored, more defined.\n\nMorris and Jerome stand off to the side\nsporting huge grins.  They're avidly\nwatching...\n\n...Vanity, Susan, and Brenda dancing up\na fierce storm.  Vanity fronts the two\nGirls and moves panther-like in front of\nthe mirrors...\n\nShe's a dynamo, her face drawn tightly,\nher movements crisp and precise.  She\nurges the Girls on, suggests and\ncajoles, strengthening their resolve.\nSweat lathers their bodies and forms\nrings on their Danskins.  The act is\nstill very rough, but the potential for\nsuccess can be felt.\n\nPRINCE suddenly enters the hall.  Morris\nspots him immediately and halts the\nMUSIC.  The Girls dance on a moment,\nthen stop perplexed.  Vanity catches\nPrince's look, shakes her head in\ndisbelief--\n\nPRINCE\nI want to talk to you.\n\nShe's out of breath, waves him off--\n\nVANITY\nNot now,  I'm busy.\n\nPRINCE\nNow.\n\nA TITTER goes through the Band Members -\n- Vanity wipes her face, fixes him with\na glare--\n\nVANITY\nI said I'm busy -- we'll talk\nlater.\n\nPRINCE\nUh, uh...\n\nHe grabs her suddenly, pulls her to the\ndoor--\n\nVANITY\nLeave me alone!  I've got a\nshow to do!\n\nShe pulls away savagely--\n\nVANITY\nYOU can't just come in here\nand take me away!  We'll talk\nlater!\n\nMorris is enraged--\n\nMORRIS\nMan -- why don't you just do\nthe walk?\n\nPrince glares at him, cups his genitals-\n-\n\nPRINCE\nWhy don't you kiss the one-\neyed snake?\n\nThe Band lets out a condescending GROAN\n-- the tension rises\n\nMORRIS\nJellybean!\n\nJellybean, 6'4\", 210 pounds, steps from\nbehind the drums, moves up behind Prince-\n-\n\nJELLYBEAN\nLet's go, Jack.\n\nPRINCE\nFuck you!\n\nHe lunges, grabs Vanity again -- she\nSHRIEKS--\n\nVANITY\nLeave me alone, dammit!  Get\nout of here!\n\nJellybean lurches, grabs Prince in a\nHEAIDLOCK, lifts him off his his feet.\nPrince kicks at him wildly--\n\nJELLYBEAN\n(enraged)\nFucker!!\n\nHe twists Prince's head backwards,\nSMASHES his body to the ground--\n\nJELLYBEAN\nStay still, motherfucker!!\n\nBut Prince continues fighting him with\neverything he's got!  Jellybean is\nastonished--\n\nJELLYBEAN\nShit!!\n\nHe twists Prince's neck savagely,\nSMASHES! his legs to the floor again and\nagain--\n\nJELLYBEAN\nStop!!\n\nVanity is crying--\n\nVANITY\nJellybean, please...\n\nPrince drops to his hands and knees exhausted.  Everybody is\nfrozen now -- scared.  The Girls are crying, the incedent\nhas already gone too far...\n\nJellybean settles his weight on Prince,\ntwists his head down painfully, trying\nto break the resistance he alone can\nfeel.  Prince remains silent, the anger\ncoursing through his body in tremors--\n\nThe Guys surround them, grabbing\nPrince's arms, legs, and feet.  He's\nlike a trapped animal now--\n\nJELLYBEAN\nLift him.\n\nVANITY\n(crying)\nDon't hurt him ...\n\nThey pick him up, move him toward the\ndoor.  He resists them slightly, his\nbody lurching in fit and starts.\nSuddenly he breaks free, faces them with\nhis back to he door.  But the Band\nMembers surround him, their wills\nunited, the obviousness of the situation\napparent to all.\n\nHe searches for Vanity's eyes, but she\ncan't face him and walks away.  Anger\nagain surges in his veins.  He cuts out\nthe door, SLAMS it behind him.\n\n(77) EXT. ACCESS ROAD, TRAIN TRACKS -- DUSK\n\nPrince WHIPS down a dirt access road\nlocked in thought, the pain and anger in\nhis eyes apparent.  Suddenly a TRAIN\nWHISTLE BLASTS just behind him, sending\na shot of fear through his guts.\n\nHe twists backwards in amazement.  A\nFREIGHT TRAIN ROARS around the bend\nBLASTING its HORN violently.  Prince\nshudders with fright, loses control of\nhis cycle for an instant.  He hits a\nseries of ruts that almost topple him to\nthe ground.\n\nHe looks back at the train confused,\nwhen another BLAST seems to SOCK him in\nthe teeth.  He twists wildly to the side\nof the road, kicking up dirt and debris,\nlurching him into the handlebars\nviolently.\n\nThe TRAIN ROARS abreast of him!  Prince\nsnaps an angry look at the engineer.\nThe Guy coolly gives him the finger and\nBLASTS the HORN violently.\n\nPrince becomes enraged!  He snaps a look\nto the speedometer: 65 mph.  He snaps a\nlook to the Engineer -- the Guy sends\nhim another obscene gesture and BLASTS\nhis HORN.\n\nPrince grits his teeth, twists the\nthrottle full.  He lurches forward in an\ninstant, blazing in front of the train,\nThe Engineer BLASTS the HORN\nmercilessly, and throws on the coals.\nThey blast down the stretch neck to\nneck, twist round a wide bend.\n\nPrince edges in front!  The Engineer\nBLASTS the HORN and moves up.  Prince\nsnaps a look to him -- the Guy mouths\nthe words:  Fuck You!\n\nPrince wants to scream!  He twists the\nthrottle, snaps a look to the\nspeedometer:  75 mph.  He RIPS past ruts\nand gullies like a madman.  The TRAIN\nmoves up.  They blast around another\nbend neck to neck\n\nSuddenly Prince's eyes widen with\nhorror.  A CAR is parked across the\naccess road, waiting to cross the track.\nHe shoots a look to the Engineer -- the\nGuy is laughing hysterically now,\nBLASTING his HORN wildly, mouthing the\nwords:  Bye Bye!\n\nPrince screams like  a MADMAN!  He\ntwists his  throttle FULL!  He blazes\nahead of the train, BLASTS! up the\nembankment, SAILS through the air...\n\n...a BRICK WALL cuts the access road in\ntwo!\n\nHe SCREAMS in bloody terror!  He hits\nthe road and fishtails wildly, locking\nhis brakes.  The WALL comes at him like\na locomotive.  He's going to hit it,\nknows it and...\n\nHe twists his throttle violently BLASTS!\ndirectly into the path of the train!\n\nThe Engineer looks on in horror!  Prince\nthrows his weight forward and...\n\n...the train ROARS past him as he\nfishtails wildly to a stop.\n\nThe Engineer sails off into the dusk,\nhis mouth agape.  Prince sits there\nbreathing fiercely, the adrenaline\nshrieking though his veins, watching\nthe train disappear into the distance.\n\n(78) EXT. STREETS AND ALLEY -- DOWNTOWN -- TWILIGHT\n\nSHOPPERS flood the sidewalks, rushing for the buses that\ntake them home.  TRAFFIC clogs  at the 77 intersections\nwhile PEDESTRIANS walk against the lights.  Prince rides\ndown the streets, hugging the right shoulder, impatient with\nthe delays.  He blasts down a side street, sees FLASHING\nLIGHTS up ahead.  GAWKERS are already crowding around.\n\nHe moves through the TRAFFIC slowly,\nglides past a POLICE CAR, and a small\nCROWD.  A CAR has run onto the sidewalk,\nknocking down the marquee to a rundown,\nneighborhood bar.\n\nSomething catches his eye -- he stops\nsuddenly.  His Mother stands against the\nwall, idly watching the goings on.  He\njumps off his bike hurriedly, walks up\nbehind her, taps her on the shoulder--\n\nPRINCE\nMa...?\n\nShe turns, he gasps out loud.  Her left\neye is swollen shut--\n\nMOTHER\n(drunkenly)\nHi, ya, baby...\n\nHer drunken breath washes over him --\nhis head spins--\n\nPRINCE\nMa...what happened?\n\nShe rubs up against him--\n\nMOTHER\nCan you give me some money?\nC'mon, just some money...\n\nShe gropes for him drunkenly -- he\nsuddenly realizes she doesn't know who\nhe is--\n\nMOTHER\nHere...here...\n\nShe tugs at her wedding ring--\n\nMOTHER\nGive me something for\nthis...just a little.  It'll\nbe okay...\n\nPRINCE\nC'mon...I'll take you home.\n\nJust then a COP moves through the Crowd-\n-\n\nCOP\nOkay, c'mon now -- break it\nup.  Let's go..\n\nThe Crowd moves out.  Police RADIOS\ncackle.  Three WOMEN stagger over, one\nof them grabbing his Mother--\n\nWOMAN\nC'mon, honey -- we're goin'\nin...\n\nShe fixes Prince with a glare--\n\nWOMAN\nYou're a little young aren't\nyou?  Get out of here.  Leave\nher alone.\n\n(79) EXT. PRINCES HOME -- NIGHT\n\nPrince BLASTS down the STREET, sweeps\ninto his drive, and jumps off his bike,\npractically smashing it into the gate.\nHis eyes are burning with anger.  He\nflies up the steps three at a time, cuts\nacross the porch, bursts throuch the\nfront door and--\n\n(80) INT. PRINCE'S POME -- NIGHT\n\n-- stalks through the living room, eyes\nblazing--\n\nPRINCE\nWhere the fuck are you?\n\nHe spins like a top, streaks down the\nhallway, throws open several doors\nviolently--\n\nPRINCE\nWhere are you?\n\nHe cuts into the kitchen raging--\n\nPRINCE\nAnswer me you fucker!!\n\nHe twists around frustrated; exhaustion,\nanger, and pain competing for the same\nspace.  Suddenly he stops, listens\nintently a moment.  We HEAR it now -- a\nPIANO.  Someone's PLAYING A PIANO.\nPrince throws a look at the basement\ndoor -- it's ajar.\n\n(81) INT. BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\nA naked LIGHT BULB snaps ON.  Prince\nhesitates a moment, descends the steps,\npauses at the door.  The MUSIC wafts\ndelicately in the night breeze.  He\nmoves down the halllway uncertainly, but\nsteadily, the MUSIC growing, drawing him\nin.\n\nHe stops, peers into the antechamber.\nHis Father is at the piano, his back to\nhim.  He's perched on the broken stool,\nplaying with all he's got.\n\nPrince moves slowly into the room, his\nknees weakening, his anger flowing from\nhim with every step he takes.  Seeing\nhis Father this way, he doesn't know if\nhe should laugh or cry.  He sits down\nsilently behind him, listens as his\nFather plays.\n\nThe SONG ends.  His Father sits a\nmoment, stretching his hands idly along\nthe keys.  Feeling a presence in the\nroom, he spins around and jumps slightly\nat seeing his son.  He fixes him with a\nthreatening look, then shrugs, hunches\nover the keys--\n\nPRINCE\nIs that yours?\n\nFATHER\n'Course it's mine.  Who else's\nis it goin' to be?  Got all\nkinds of them.  They're\ndifferent too.\n\nPRINCE\nI'd like to see them.  You got\nthem written down somewhere?\n\nFATHER\nNo, man -- I don't write them\ndown -- don't need to.  That's\nthe big difference between you\nand me.\n\nPRINCE\nThought you weren't going to\nplay no more.\n\nHis Father looks at him sullenly, then\nlooks down, stares at the keys.\nPrince's eyes well with tears--\n\nPRINCE\nI saw Mom up the street.  She\nlooked pretty bad.  Any idea\nhow she got that way?\n\nHis Father bites his his lip, rubs a\nhand over his face, stares at the keys.\nHis voice comes with difficulty--\n\nPRINCE\nYeah...\n(a beat)\nI got a girlfriend.\n\nFATHER\nYou gonna get married?\n\nPRINCE\n(long pause)\nI don't know.\n\nHis Father shares a hurtful look with\nhim, then stares darkly at the floor\nbelow--\n\nFATHER\nNever get married.\n\n(82) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\nThe CLUB is THROBBING.  Prince is\nonstage, stripped to the waist, SWEAT\nseeping from his pores in torrents.\nHe's deep into the pit of \"Computer\nBlue, \" locked into a provocative,\nobscene graphic with Wendy. She's on her\nknees in front of him, his crotch moving\ndirectly in front of her lips.  She's\nmade up fiercely, looks like Prince\nhimself.  The total effect is unnerving\n-- Prince is going down on himself.\n\nBilly Sparks stands by the bar pretty\nupset.  Jill stands slack-jawed.  The\nKIDS have stopped dancing, drinking --\nthey staring at the display,.shaking\ntheir heads confused...\n\nThe BEAT is SAVAGE.  Prince is in his\nown world, living his own private hell.\nSuddenly the MUSIC crescendos, then\nwinds down like a roller coaster\nsweeping everyone along.  The BEAT\nchanges radically.  He turns his back to\nthe audience and plays ...\n\n...and we suddenly recognize the MUSIC\nas his Father's -- the song he played on\nthe piano the night before. But it's\nPrince's now, stamped with his own\nsignature.  He's bent at the waist, his\nback to the audience, alone with his\nfather's, and his, pain.\n\nThe CROWD fidgets...Billy Sparks fastens\nhis eyes on Prince angrily.\n\n(83) EXT. CLUB/INT. MORRIS' CAR (1ST AVE. ST. BAR) -- NIGHT\n\nKIDS are hanging out in front of the\nclub.  The usual queue, however, is\nnoticeably absent.\n\nThe yellow Caddy sweeps up.  Jerome is\nat the wheel, Morris and Vanity sit in\nthe back.  Morris is dressed elegantly,\nresplendent in a 5O's-style suit.  She's\nbeautiful in a sleek black dress, with\nlong black gloves, and heels--\n\nVANITY\nWhat are we doing here,\nMorris?\n\nMORRIS\nWhat do you mean?\n\nVANITY\nI don't want to be here.  I\ndon't want to hurt anybody.\n\nMORRIS\nIt's not about hurting\nanybody.  This is business.\nWe can use the exposure.\n\nJust then Brenda and Susan come up to\nthe car excitedly.  Brenda is dressed in\na 40's-style dress, Susan wears a form-\nfitting leopard one.  They both look\ngorgeous--\n\nBRENDA\nHi -- you coming in?\n\nTheir excitement and nervousness is\nendearing.  Vanity's heart goes out to\nthem.  She forces a smile, climbs out\nunaided--\n\nVANITY\nYour horns are showing,\nMorris.\n\nMORRIS\nYeah...but they're holding up\nmy halo.\n\n(84) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\nPrince is on-stage, deep into the\nclosing moments of \"Computer Blue.\"  He\npaces back and forth frantically, still\nlocked in his own private hell.  The\nCrowd's attention has wandered, however,\nand very few remain on the dance floor,\nfinding it too much trouble to keep up\nwith the changing shifts in the music.\nEven his band members are edgy, casting\nquick looks to each other, wishing to\nget on with more compelling audience-\npleasing sounds.\n\nBAR AREA\nas Billy Sparks shakes hands with Morris\nand Jerome and is introduced to Vanity\nSix for the first time.  We can tell by\nhis reaction that he likes what he sees.\nHe kisses Brenda and Susan, saves a\nspecial squeeze for Vanity herself.  He\nescorts the whole group to a table\nacross the floor.  Vanity brings up the\nrear, casts a quick look to Prince\nonstage.\n\nPRINCE\nfastens on her and brings \"Computer\nBlue\" to a rousing end.  The Crowd\napplauds, but it's more out of respect\nthan eagerness.  He doesn't seem to\nnotice though, or care.  He confers\nquickly with his group., then moves\ncenter-stage.  The Band Members trade\nfrustrated looks with each other -- it's\nobvious that they have some trouble with\nthe next song...\n\nPrince presses his lips to the mike, and\nthe MUSIC starts.  He begins SINGING\n\"Darling Nicky\"--\n\nPRINCE\nI knew a girl named Nicky,\nI guess you can say she was a\nsex fiend.\nI met her in a hotel lobby\nmasturbating in magazines.\nShe said, How'd you like to\nwaste some time,\nAnd I could not resist\nWhen I saw little Nicky grind.\n\nBILLY SPARKS\nshoots a fierce look to Prince, helps\nMorris, Jerome and the Girls to their\ntable.  Vanity is watching Prince, a\npuzzled look on her face--\n\nMORRIS\nHee, hee...little empty\ntonight, huh, Billy.  But I\nguess money isn't everything.\n\nJerome busts up--\n\nJEROME\nOh no... that's cold...\n\nBut Billy agrees--\n\nBILLY\nThe Duke of Dick is in rare\nform tonight.\n\nThey all look toward the stage--\n\nPRINCE\nis fastened on Vanity and it's apparent\nto all.  He launches into the next verse-\n-\n\nPRINCE\nShe took me to her castle\nAnd I could not believe my\neyes.\nShe had so many devices\nEverything that money could\nbuy.\nShe said,\nSign your name on the dotted\nline,\nThe lights went out,\nAnd Nicky started to grind.\n\nVANITY\nflushes with embarrassment.  Billy and\nMorris notice this and glare at Prince.\n\nPRINCE\nlooks dead-center at them, and then to\nVanily--\n\nPRINCE\nI woke up the next morning.\nNicky wasn't there.\nI looked all ov'r all I found\nWas a phone number on the\nstairs.\nIt said thank you for a funky\ntime,\nCall me up when ev'r you want\nto grind.\n\nVANITY\nstands suddenly, fighting back tears.\nShe backs from the table quickly, knocks\nthe chair over.  Morris tries to help\nher, but she sweeps past him, hurrying\nfor the exit.\n\n(85) INT. STAIRWAY/EXT.

The MUSIC is slick and fierce,\nthe Girls sexy and sure.  Wearing black\nbikini panties, black tails and boots,\nVanity dances center-stage and begins\nSINGING.  She's mesmerizing, her look so\nalluring, so profound that the audience\nsits slack-jawed in amazement.  The\nSPOTLIGHT is hers and she soaks it in,\nradiating a sexiness that has the\naudience at her feet.  The entire\nconcept -- dress, dance, music and\nstaging -- is overwhelming, with just\nthe right degree of playfulness to allow\nthe Crowd easy passage into the fantasy\nworld the Girls create.  Brenda and\nSusan play off her wonderfully, sharing\nsecret looks with the Crowd, balancing\nthe wickedness of the act with an\ninnocence that is enticing.  They're\nworking strongly as a unit now, the\nAUDIENCE roaring their approval...\n\nMORRIS\nand Jerome are beside themselves with\nhappiness.  The pull off their shades\nimmediately, sit back and glow in the\naudience's response.\n\nPRINCE\nstands in the back, his eyes glued to\nVanity.  Her strength and sureness in\nfront of the Crowd is breathtaking.  The\naudience loves her and he suddenly feels\nvery alone -- as if another wall has\ngone up between them.  He looks away a\nmoment and spots...\n\n...Morris looking at him with a self-\nsatisfied, triumphant grin on his face.\nPrince looks away, moves out of his\neyesight.\n\n\"Sex Shooter\" comes to an end.

The Girls, slighly\nover-whelmed by the response and\nflushing deep red, hold one\nanother.tightly and take repeated bows.\n\nPRINCE\nwatches the Girls bowing to thunderous\nAPPLAUSE.  Suddenly Vanity looks at him\nand touches the earring she's wearing --\nit's his Mother's.  His knees weaken\ninstantly, and he locks eyes with her.\nThe heat between them is unmistakable.\nShe smiles vividly, gives him an\nendearing wave and steps back as the\ncurtain closes.\n\nHe's MOVING through the Crowd before he\nknows it, trying to get to the backstage\ndoor.  The Crowd is thick, his path\nmomentarily blocked.

Frustrated, he cuts\noutside.\n\nBACKSTAGE\nas Vanity watches Prince leave.  A\nprofound sadness sweeps her face.\nSuddenly Susan is by her Side, hugging\nand kissing her happily.  Brenda runs\nup, pouring champagne.  Morris, Jerome\nand The Time are at the end of the\nhallway and beckon her excitedly into\nthe room.  Vanity forces a smile, goes\ndown the hallway, casting another look\nat the exit door.\n\n(96) EXT. BACK ALLEY, THE TASTE -- NIGHT\n\nMorris and Vanity stagger down the ALLEY\nobviously very drunk.  Morris pulls from\na FLASK.  Vanity is still in her\nlingerie, wears an open coat over it.\nHer speech is slurred--\n\nVANITY\nDid you hear these people\napplauding?  They loved us --\nthey wanted to rip us apart,\nand this is just our first\nnight.  I can see it now,\nwe're all going to be big\nstars.  I can feel it.\n\nMORRIS\n(singing)\nAin't nobody bad like me.\n\nShe kisses him spontaneously on the\ncheek--\n\nVANITY\nMorris, you're a genius.\n\nMORRIS\nYe-es...\n\nHe fixes her with a sexy look, takes a\nhealthy look from his flask, then gives\nit too her.  Vanity throws her head\nback, drinks fully, the liquor coursing\nover her cheeks.  He devours her with\nhis eyes, opens the door to the Caddy--\n\nMORRIS\nLet's go, Bebe.\n\nShe stops as if remembering something--\n\nVANITY\nHuh, where's Jerome?\n\nMORRIS\nIn his skin...hee, hee...\n\nHe's trying to nudge her into the Caddy-\n-\n\nVANITY\nIs he coming?\n\nMORRIS\nI gave him the night off.\n\nVANITY\nWhy?\n\nHe staggers back from the car, undulates\nhis hips wantonly--\n\nMORRIS\nWhawhak!\n\nShe busts up.  Just then a MOTORCYCLE\ncan be heard off screen.  They look\naround drunkenly, trying to discern its\ndirection.  Suddenly Prince BLASTS\naround the corner FULL OUT!  He streaks\nby Morris and KICKS him flat on his ass\ninto the garbage--\n\nMORRIS\n(wails)\nOh, no -- Oh, God...No!\n\nPrince skids to a slick stop.  Vanity is\ntransfixed.  The entire episode  took\nless than five seconds.  He twists the\nthrottle, BLASTS down upon her...\n\nShe breaks in a panic!  She runs\nclumsily down another alley, her coat\nflying.  He WHIPS after her like a\nmadman.  She flies around the corner --\na dead end!  He fishtails to a slick\nstop--\n\nPRINCE\nGet on!\n\nThere's no way out!  Suddenly she lets\nout an excited YELP, jumps on.  He guns\nthe bike, BURSTS up the alley.  Morris\njumps into his path drunkenly, his arms\nextended--\n\nMORRIS\nStop! Stop!\n\nBut Prince BLAZES down upon him, sending\nhim slipping and sliding to safety.  He\nBLASTS around the bend--\n\nMORRIS\nMotherfucker!  You long-haired\nfaggot!\n\n(97) EXT. HIGHWAY  TO EMBANKMENT -- NIGHT\n\nPrince and Vanity WHIPPING down the\nhighway.\n\n(98) EXT. EMBANKMENT -- NIGHT\n\nThey streak down the road, slow, then\nmove down a small embankment.  He stops\nthe bike and gets off.  She's in a foul\nmood, staggers around dully, her head\npounding, her speech slurred--\n\nVANITY\nSo here we are again.  So this\nis it, huh?  What do you want\nthis time?\n\nHe looks at her painfully, upset about\nher drunken state--\n\nVANITY\nWhat's your problem now?\nWhat's your main problem?\n\nPRINCE\nNo problem.  I just wanted to\ntalk, alright? I just want us\nto be okay, to really get\nalong.  No big deal.\n\nShe cackles, falls flat on her ass,\nhoists herself up--\n\nVANITY\nNo big deal, huh...\n\nShe pulls Morris' FLASK from her jacket\n-- his eyes blacken--\n\nPRINCE\nGive me that.\n\nVANITY\nNo, definitely not.  Who are\nyou?  You can't tell me what\nto do.\n\nShe puts it to her lips--\n\nPRINCE\nPlease don't drink that.  Give\nit to me.\n\nShe holds the flask to her lips\ndefiantly, then goes to drink.\n\nHe lashes out suddenly, SMASHES it from\nher grip.  She SCREAMS wildly, SLAPS him\nhard across the face.  He stands shocked\na moment, his rage surging within him,\nsmashing through every safety valve he's\nacquired in his life.  He BACKHANDS her\nsavagely across the jaw.\n\nShe hits the ground like a rag doll.  He\nlooks at her curiously, bends over her -\n- she sucker-punches him with everything\nshe's got!  He SCREAMS in rage and grabs\nher hands as they flail about his face.\nHe squeezes her fingers back while the\ntears stream down her cheeks and her\nmouth forms a silent \"ow\"!  She bares\nher teeth angrily and he sucks at her\nmouth, biting and kissing her in a fever\npitch.\n\nShe kicks at him violently, hot tears\nstreaming down her cheeks.  He jams his\nleg between hers, rubs it firmly against\nher bottom.  She struggles helplessly\nagainst him as he covers her breasts,\nher stomach, her thighs with his lips.\nQuick breaths escape from her -- her\nbreathing begins to race...\n\nHe snaps her panties in two, pulls them\nfrom between her legs.  She spreads\nherself as he releases his pants.  She\nsqueezes his buttocks, pulls him toward\nher -- but Prince resists her coldly,\nregards her with contempt.  Suddenly he\nflips her onto her stomach, forces her\nto stand painfully on her knees.  He\nrubs his hand between her buttocks, then\nthrusts into her painfully, driving\nhimself to the very depths of her...\n\n...but she stifles a cry, arches her\nback, and meets his thrusts fiercely,\nmoving quicker and quicker, banging her\nbuttocks against his thighs again and\nagain.  She's drawing from him now,\nturning the humiliation around,\nobtaining all that she needs and\ndesires.  He's powerless -- her thrusts\nset the pace.  She rises, Prince still\ninside her and tugs on him rapidly,\ncausing him to ejaculate suddenly,\ndrawing from him a sharp and sudden\ncry...\n\nShe moves away, draws her coat tightly\nabout her, fixes him with a contemptuous\nlook--\n\nVANITY\n\nYou're nothing, Prince,\nabsolutely nothing.  You think\nyou're so special --  but deep\ndown you're just like all the\nrest.\n(a beat)\nYour whole life you've been\nhiding, hiding behind your\nmusic.  But now you don't even\nhave that, because last\nnight...last night you used it\nto hurt someone, someone who\nreally cares.\n\nShe runs up the embankment, wipes away\nher tears, faces him--\n\nVANITY\nIf you put your hands on me\nlike that ever again, I'll be\nthe last person you touch.\n\nShe pulls off his Mother's earring,\nthrows it at him.  Tears flowing, she\nstreaks into the HIGHWAY blindly,\ndirectly into the path of a SPEEDING CAR-\n-\n\nTHE DRIVER\nspots her in his HEADLIGHTS, SLAMS on\nhis brakes!  He SKIDS wildly across the\nroad, comes to a SCREECHING, BURNING\nstop inches from her thigh!\n\nVANITY\nshoots a look at Prince, her lips\ntrembling, her love for him, written\nplainly on her face.  But his eyes flash\ndefiantly.  She bites her lip sadly,\nthen snaps a hot look at the Driver--\n\nVANITY\nI  need a  ride.\n\nShe cuts around the car, hops in.  The\nDriver skids off into the night.  Prince\nstands there trembling, watches as it\ndisappears into the distance.\n\nDISSOLVE   TO:\n\n(99) EXT. PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\nPrince pulls up to the wooden gate, cuts\nthe motor, gets off.  He walk wearily\nacross the porch, moves to the front\ndoor -- it's wide open.  He thinks\nnothing of it, cuts into the house,\ncloses it behind him.\n\n(100) INT. PRINCE'S HOUSE -- GROUND  FLOOR -- NIGHT\n\nHe stands by the door motionless, a\ncurious look on his face.  The STEREO is\non, the NEEDLE skipping monotonously\nalong the record.  His mouth opens into\na spasm--\n\nPRINCE\nDad...?\n\nSilence.  A sudden dread courses through\nhim, leaving a hollow in his stomach.\nHis feet are like lead.  He moves\nheavily into the room--\n\nPRINCE\nMom...?\n\nNothing.  Panic sets in.  He STREAKS\ndown the hallway, twists open the\nbedroom door -- it's empty.  Blue NIGHT\nLIGHT glows through the windows.\nCURTAINS play delicately in the breeze.\nHe's thoughtful, walks back into the\nliving room...\n\n...the COFFEE TABLE is SMASHED.  He\nlooks at it curiously, wondering\nstupidly if it had always been like\nthat.  Then sudden bolt of fear makes\nhis head swim.  A lamp, a porcelain\ndish, some knickknacks on the mantle --\nall smashed.  He rushes into the\nkitchen, looks around crazily--\n\nPRINCE\nDaddd...!\n\nNothing but the decay of his scream.\nThe BASEMENT door is ajar.

Huge white bandages are\nbunched up along the back of his head.\nHis Mother is kneeling by the gurney,\ncrying hysterically, grasping his hands\nin a white panic.  TWO COPS support her.\nSomeone is SHOUTING instructions.\nRADIOS crackle incessantly.  A MEDIC\ncries--\n\nMEDIC\nLift!\n\nAnd the gurney is hoisted up the stairs\nquickly, the bulk of the crowd\nfollowing, his Mother supported as she\nascends the stairs.\n\nPrince sits on a tattered sofa in the\ncorner, his head bowed.  Cops standing\nand kneeling beside him.  Somebody\nfinished taking notes, closes his pad.\nOne Cop rests a hand on his shoulder,\ntalks to him in soft tones.  Prince\nshakes his head slightly.  The Cop gives\nthe group a signal and everyone\ndisperses, moves up the stairs.  The Cop\nlooks at him sympathetically, then\ncloses the door behind him.\n\n(104) INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT\n\nPRINCE\nsits motionless a long time.  Moonlight\nfloods the basement with a foreboding\nlight.  A dog BARKS somewhere in the\ndistance.  He looks up suddenly, his\nface agitated, his eyes red from tears.\n\nPRINCE'S POV--\nCHALK MARKS on the floor outlining the\nbody of his Father.  There's a GUN in\nhis Father's hand clearly marked.\n\nA train WHISTLE in the distance.  He's\nstaring at the gun.  He shakes his head,\nrubs a hand over his face vigorously and\nlooks up again...\n\n...the GUN in his Father's hand.  He\ncan't get it out of his mind!

He\nsqueezes them shut, looks up...\n\nThe gun.\n\nHe bolts to his feet, paces back and\nforth in a panic!  The train is HOWLING!\nA rope in the corner of the room, his\nface, the gun...\n\nHe sits dully, gazes at the rope as if\nin a trance.  The TRAIN is ROARING past\nthe house, it's HORN BLASTING.  The\nrope, the gun, and his body dangling\nfrom the rafters in the night breeze--\n\nPRINCE\n(screaming)\nNoooooo!!\n\nHe lurches to his feet, cuts through the\nbasement like a madman.  He grabs a\nstick and starts SLASHING things\ncrazily, moving through the room\nswinging his stick wildly again and\nagain.\n\nHe's lost to himself now, deep in the\npit of an unknown terror, expurgating a\nhorror that has been festering in him\nfor years.  He flings his stick at the\nwall, unends shelves and bureaus,\ntrampling old memories that have lain\ndormant for years.\n\nDrawer after drawer is flung against the\nwall, their contents smashing and\nscattering about.  He opens a large,\noaken chest and flips over.  Thick three\ninch piles of yellowed paper fall out.\nHe snaps through the rubber bands\nholding them together and flings the\npaper at the wall again and again...\n\n...he stops suddenly, shocked.  He SEES\nmusical notes written down on the paper.\nhis heart pounding in his chest, he\nsearches frantically through the rubble\nscattered about him.  More and more\nmusical notes, sketched ideas, simple\nmelodies, entire songs and scores -- all\nmeticulously recorded on lined yellowed\npaper, dated for the last 20 years, and\nsigned...by his Father.  He's shocked to\na standstill.  Then the full\nsignificance of what's before him hits\nhim like a sledgehammer.  He collapses\nin agony against the chest, tears\nflowing down his cheeks.\n\n(105) INT.

The APPLAUSE trickles\naway.  He continues to stare in the\naudience making no attempt to direct his\nBand, or start a tune.  A nervous\nTWITTER ripples though the crowd.  Those\nwho know about the tragedy feel a\nprofound embarrassment for him -- but no\none turns away.  Then his voice comes\nclear and mellifluous--\n\nPRINCE\nI would like to do a song that\ntwo of my friends wrote.\n\nA MURMUR, cuts through the Crowd like a\nriptide.  Prince snaps a look to Lisa\nand Wendy and confirms that it is indeed\ntheir song.  They can't believe it!\nTears spring to Wendy's eyes before she\nknows it ...\n\nPrince smiles at her, then gazes at his\nentire Band.  Their eyes fasten on him\nin an instant.  He counts softly and...\n\nMUSIC.  The opening bars of \"Purple\nRain.\"  He turns to to the audience and\nSINGS....\n\nIt's a ballad, a poem really, a plea for\nunderstanding, love, and survival.  It's\na testament, a pact if you will, between\nhimself and others...\n\nThe AUDIENCE is mesmerized, all EYES are\nupon him -- but Prince doesn't notice.\nLips pressed against the mike, dark eyes\nstreaming, he's lost to himself now,\nloosening all that's within him,\ncleansing himself of his rage, hatred\nand pain...\n\nVANITY\nis crying.  Every moment she has shared\nwith him is expressed in this song, and\nthe effect on her is unnerving.  Her\nheart leaps to him in a way she never\nthought possible.  But she lets it go\nwillingly, as the words draw her in,\nseducing her somehow, making her\nfree...as if the music, his words, all\nthat he has experienced and  understood,\nis purging what is confused and ugly\nwithin herself, leaving her with an\nunderstanding and joy that burns in her\nwomb like soft fire.  A smile springs to\nher lips as tears continue to flow, and\nshe finds herself moving closer...\n\n...as the Audience moves closer, drawn\nsomehow to the stage, to the person who\nSINGS so truly, to the person who gives\nof himself unselfishly to all that he\nfeels...\n\nPrince begins a long sustained CRY that\ncuts though the hearts of all present.\nThe MUSIC builds awsomely, and he\ncontinues to sing out, emptying himself\nof all the remaining pain lying within.\nThe MUSIC crescendos and comes to a\nquiet end...\n\nStunned SILENCE.  A silence so profound\nyou could hear a pin drop.  Prince\nsighs, assumes the worse, then cuts\nacross the stage purposefully.  Now some\nCLAPPING.  And a WHISTLE from the back\nand the SHOUTING.  And more WHISTLES and\nsome even SCREAMING.  And the WHISTLES\nand the SHOUTS and the CLAPPING growing\nand growing as....\n\n(112)  INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n\nPrince cuts from the stage in a frenzy,\nrushes toward the rear exit.  The\nAPPLAUSE is building and building until\nit's a THUNDER, an onrushing ROAR, an\navalanche of HYSTERIA that rocks the\nclub mightily...\n\nPRINCE\nis still running though, his face\nstreaming with tears, past the surprised\nlook of Jill, past the FANS, past\neveryone -- stripping of his clothes\nfiercely, flinging off his jacket, his\nshirt, his scarf--\n\n(113) EXT. BACK ENTRANCE, INT. HALLWAY -- CLUB -- NIGHT\n\nHe SMASHES open the door, BURSTS\noutside.  He sucks in the night air as\nif he was drowning.  He wipes away his\ntears, rushes to his bike, starts to\nundo the chain...\n\n...they're SHOUTING his NAME...\n\nNot randomly, not haphazardly, but...in\nunison.  And relentless, very demanding,\ndownright urgent, and...it's beautiful.\n\nA wry smile crosses his lips.  He heads\nback to the door.  Jill is there,\nscared, her face a map of tears.  He\nflashes her a smile--\n\nPRINCE\nHi.\n\nShe's thunderstruck, can barely squeak\nit out--\n\nJILL\nHi.\n\nAnd he whips into the hallway.  Her face\ndissolves into a smile of pure joy.\n\n(114) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\nMOVING now, FAST and FURIOUS.  The\nHALLWAY is LINED with PEOPLE.  They\nreach for him as he passes, touching\nhim, showering him with their love.\nSomeone hands him his shirt, another his\nscarf -- it's so intense!\n\nHe's moving quickly now, his jacket up\nahead, closer...he stops suddenly,\nstunned...\n\n...Vanity is holding his jacket.  He's\nstruck speechless -- she hands it to him\nsmiling, tears streaming down her face--\n\nVANITY\nI love you.\n\nHis knees go weak, she kisses him\nspontaneously, pushes him lovingly to\nthe stage.\n\nTHE CROWD IS ROARING!\n\n(115)  INT. HALLWAY AND STAGE REAR -- NIGHT\n\nHe's half-running now like crazy -- his\nBand is on-stage, peering anxiously into\nthe hallway.  They spot him and relief\nsweeps their faces like a tidal wave.\nHe whips his jacket on, rushes up the\nstairs...\n\n(116)  INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\nSTAGE\nTHUNDER!  Prince walks center-\nstage...and bows.  The AUDIENCE goes\nBERSERK!  He acknowledges Wendy and\nLisa, and then the entire Band.  The\nCROWD is jumping out of their skin!  He\nstraps on his guitar, gives a deft\nsignal and--\n\nMUSIC.  The Band launches into \"I Would\nDie For You.\"  Vanity squeezes her way\nthrough the crowd and stands watching\nPrince from the wings.  He presses his\nlips to the mike and SINGS.\n\nThe MUSIC continues as we...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n(117)  INT. LIVING ROOM, PRINCE'S HOME -- NIGHT\n\nPrince walks through the LIVING ROOM\nslowly, gazes at the smashed table, the\nbroken lamp and dishes. Every item in\nthe room suddenly takes on a profound\nsignificance.  His father's slippers\nunder the sofa, his mother's knickknacks\non the table, her pen and ink drawings\non the wall.  After a moment, he picks\nup his father's slippers, studies them a\nlong time.\n\n(118)  INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\nThe DOOR opens -- a LIGHT snaps ON.  He\nwalks into the room, places his father's\nslippers in the CLOSET.  His Mother's\ndress is lying in a heap on the floor.\nHe picks it up, and puts it away.\n\n(119) INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT\n\nas he descends the steps hesitantly.\nThe FLOOR is covered with rubble.  He\nsits on the steps, stares at his\nfather's MUSIC on the floor.\n\n\"I Would Die For You\" continues as we...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n(120)  INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\nPrince on-stage SINGING \"I Would Die For\nYou.\"  The AUDIENCE is captivated,\nlocked into his grip again.  His eyes\nseem to be focused on something far\naway.  He closes them tightly, presses\nhis lips against the mike.\n\nThe MUSIC continues as we...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n(121)  INT. BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOME -- TWILIGHT\n\nHe's in the final stages of cleaning the\nbasement floor.  The debris has been\nswept up, shelves righted, smashed items\nthrown away...\n\nHe stacks his Father's music neatly,\ntears welling in his eyes.  He places it\nin new boxes, stands wearily, a\nfulfilled look on his face.  Suddenly he\nstops -- stares at the awful chalk marks\non the floor:  his Father lying down,\nthe gun gripped in his hand...\n\n\"I Would Die For You\" continues as we...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n(122)  INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\nPrince on-stage SINGING  \"I Would Die\nFor You.\"  He's lost to himself now,\nlocked into a personal horror he alone\ncan see.  The CROWD is pressed against\nthe stage, mesmerized by his\nperformance.  Billy Sparks is also drawn\nin, amazed at the power being generated\nfrom the stage.  Prince sweeps the\naudience with his eyes, then fastens on\nVanity earnestly, SINGS directly to her.\n\nThe MUSIC continues as we...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n(123)  INT. BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOME -- DAWN\n\nHe pulls a HOSE from behind the washer,\ndraws it on to the floor.  He hesitates\na moment, gazes one last time at his\nFather's outline, tears welling in his\neyes.  He turns the water on, watches as\nthe dusty yellow chalk gives way\nreluctantly, mixing with the water,\nswirling down the drain.  Calmness\nsweeps his face like a passing cloud.\n\nJust then SUNLIGHT blazes in through the\ncasement windows.  Water droplets\nglisten brilliantly in the morning\nlight.  He turns the water off, goes to\nput the hose back -- stops suddenly,\nsurprised...\n\n...his Mother's earring lies on the\nfloor.\n\nHe's entranced, picks it up, stares at\nit a moment.  Everything he's been\nthrough comes rushing at him like a loco\nmotive.  The confusion, the shouting and\nviolence, the darkness that eclipsed his\nparents' life -- it's all there, lying\njust below the surface, settled into his\nheart.  But now there's a difference --\nhe knows it's there and has discovered\nwhat could happen when it takes control\nof your life.\n\nSo as he stands in the basement, on the\nclean cellar floor, he realizes\nthat...he'll just take one thing at a\ntime, and do it right.  Better than\nanybody else.  He smiles, realizes that\nin the last few weeks, he's never felt\nbetter than he feels right now.  He\nturns quickly, flips the earring to the\nstairwell...\n\n...Vanity plucks it from the air.  Their\neyes lock and they share smiles of pure\njoy.  He picks up his father's music,\nand they both head up the stairs.\n\n\"I Would Die For You\" continues as we--\n\nCUT TO:\n\n(124)  INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\nCELEBRATION!  Everyone is JUMPING up and\ndown.  Prince is radiant, strutting\nacross the stage, his hands upraised.\nThe CROWD goes WILD!  He flashes a wide\ngrin to Vanity, then twists, eyeballs\nthe CROWD wickedly, wonderfully.  It's\ntoo much!\n\nEveryone is joining in now.  Even Morris\nand Jerome, standing in the wings, start\nDANCING like crazy.  Then suddenly they\ncatch themselves, stop, act dignified.\nBut Vanity sees them and busts up.  They\ncatch her look, laugh heartily and join\nin again.\n\nThe MUSIC segues into a fierce BEAT.\nThe CROWD lets out a ROAR!  Prince\nstrips off his guitar, streaks center-\nstage.  The Band launches into \"Baby,\nI'm A Star.\"\n\n...And the CROWD laughing, dancing,\nshouting and loving.  The CLUB is ALIVE!\n\nAnd the MUSIC continues...forever...1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/158878", "artist_names": "Charlotte Bront\u00eb", "full_title": "Shirley (Chap. 19) by\u00a0Charlotte\u00a0Bront\u00eb", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c51b297fd7d8347548bacb9416d65186.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c51b297fd7d8347548bacb9416d65186.329x329x1.jpg", "id": 158878, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 225672, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": null, "path": "/Charlotte-bronte-shirley-chap-19-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Charlotte-bronte-shirley-chap-19-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c51b297fd7d8347548bacb9416d65186.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c51b297fd7d8347548bacb9416d65186.329x329x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Shirley (Chap. 19)", "title_with_featured": "Shirley (Chap. 19)", "updated_by_human_at": 1370067860, "url": "https://genius.com/Charlotte-bronte-shirley-chap-19-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/38011", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f6ccc9405cee1025b9f30b4208813cc9.200x286x1.png", "id": 38011, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f6ccc9405cee1025b9f30b4208813cc9.200x286x1.png", "index_character": "c", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Charlotte Bront\u00eb", "slug": "Charlotte-bronte", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Charlotte-bronte"}, "artist": "Charlotte Bront\u00eb", "lyrics": "Shirley (Chap. 19) LyricsA Summer Night\n\nThe hour was now that of dusk. A clear air favoured the kindling of the stars.\n\n\"There will be just light enough to show me the way home,\" said Miss Keeldar, as she prepared to take leave of Caroline at the rectory garden door.\n\n\"You must not go alone, Shirley; Fanny shall accompany you.\"\n\n\"That she shall not. Of what need I be afraid in my own parish? I would walk from Fieldhead to the church any fine midsummer night, three hours later than this, for the mere pleasure of seeing the stars and the chance of meeting a fairy.\"\n\n\"But just wait till the crowd is cleared away.\"\n\"Agreed. There are the five Misses Armitage streaming by. Here comes Mrs. Sykes's phaeton, Mr. Wynne's close carriage, Mrs. Birtwhistle's car. I don't wish to go through the ceremony of bidding them all good-bye, so we will step into the garden and take shelter amongst the laburnums for an instant.\"\n\nThe rectors, their curates, and their churchwardens now issued from the church porch. There was a great confabulation, shaking of hands, congratulation on speeches, recommendation to be careful of the night air, etc. By degrees the throng dispersed, the carriages drove off. Miss Keeldar was just emerging from her flowery refuge when Mr. Helstone entered the garden and met her.\n\n\"Oh, I want you!\" he said. \"I was afraid you were already gone.\u2014Caroline, come here.\"\n\nCaroline came, expecting, as Shirley did, a lecture on not having been visible at church. Other subjects, however, occupied the rector's mind.\n\n\"I shall not sleep at home to-night,\" he continued. \"I have just met with an old friend, and promised to accompany him. I shall return probably about noon to-morrow. Thomas, the clerk, is engaged, and I cannot get him to sleep in the house, as I usually do when I am absent for a night. Now\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Now,\" interrupted Shirley, \"you want me as a gentleman\u2014the first gentleman in Briarfield, in short\u2014to supply your place, be master of the rectory and guardian of your niece and maids while you are away?\"\n\n\"Exactly, captain. I thought the post would suit you. Will you favour Caroline so far as to be her guest for one night? Will you stay here instead of going back to Fieldhead?\"\n\n\"And what will Mrs. Pryor do? she expects me home.\"\n\n\"I will send her word. Come, make up your mind to stay. It grows late; the dew falls heavily. You and Caroline will enjoy each other's society, I doubt not.\"\n\n\"I promise you, then, to stay with Caroline,\" replied Shirley. \"As you say, we shall enjoy each other's society. We will not be separated to-night. Now, rejoin your old friend, and fear nothing for us.\"\n\n\"If there should chance to be any disturbance in the night, captain; if you should hear the picking of a lock, the cutting out of a pane of glass, a stealthy tread of steps about the house (and I need not fear to tell you, who bear a well-tempered, mettlesome heart under your girl's ribbon sash, that such little incidents are very possible in the present time), what would you do?\"\n\n\"Don't know; faint, perhaps\u2014fall down, and have to be picked up again. But, doctor, if you assign me the post of honour, you must give me arms. What weapons are there in your stronghold?\"\n\n\"You could not wield a sword?\"\n\"No; I could manage the carving-knife better.\"\n\n\"You will find a good one in the dining-room sideboard\u2014a lady's knife, light to handle, and as sharp-pointed as a poniard.\"\n\n\"It will suit Caroline. But you must give me a brace of pistols. I know you have pistols.\"\n\n\"I have two pairs. One pair I can place at your disposal. You will find them suspended over the mantelpiece of my study in cloth cases.\"\n\n\"Loaded?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not on the cock. Cock them before you go to bed. It is paying you a great compliment, captain, to lend you these. Were you one of the awkward squad you should not have them.\"\n\n\"I will take care. You need delay no longer, Mr. Helstone. You may go now.\u2014He is gracious to me to lend me his pistols,\" she remarked, as the rector passed out at the garden gate. \"But come, Lina,\" she continued, \"let us go in and have some supper. I was too much vexed at tea with the vicinage of Mr. Sam Wynne to be able to eat, and now I am really hungry.\"\n\nEntering the house, they repaired to the darkened dining-room, through the open windows of which apartment stole the evening air, bearing the perfume of flowers from the garden, the very distant sound of far-retreating steps from the road, and a soft, vague murmur whose origin Caroline explained by the remark, uttered as she stood listening at the casement, \"Shirley, I hear the beck in the Hollow.\"\n\nThen she rang the bell, asked for a candle and some bread and milk\u2014Miss Keeldar's usual supper and her own. Fanny, when she brought in the tray, would have closed the windows and the shutters, but was requested to desist for the present. The twilight was too calm, its breath too balmy to be yet excluded. They took their meal in silence. Caroline rose once to remove to the window-sill a glass of flowers which stood on the sideboard, the exhalation from the blossoms being somewhat too powerful for the sultry room. In returning she half opened a drawer, and took from it something that glittered clear and keen in her hand.\n\n\"You assigned this to me, then, Shirley, did you? It is bright, keen-edged, finely tapered; it is dangerous-looking. I never yet felt the impulse which could move me to direct this against a fellow-creature. It is difficult to fancy that circumstances could nerve my arm to strike home with this long knife.\"\n\n\"I should hate to do it,\" replied Shirley, \"but I think I could do it, if goaded by certain exigencies which I can imagine.\" And Miss Keeldar quietly sipped her glass of new milk, looking somewhat thoughtful and a little pale; though, indeed, when did she not look pale? She was never florid.\n\nThe milk sipped and the bread eaten, Fanny was again summoned. She and Eliza were recommended to go to bed, which they were quite willing to do, being weary of the day's exertions, of much cutting of currant-buns, and filling of urns and teapots, and running backwards and forwards with trays. Ere long the maids' chamber door was heard to close. Caroline took a candle and went quietly all over the house, seeing that every window was fast and every door barred. She did not even evade the haunted back kitchen nor the vault-like cellars. These visited, she returned.\n\n\"There is neither spirit nor flesh in the house at present,\" she said, \"which should not be there. It is now near eleven o'clock, fully bedtime; yet I would rather sit up a little longer, if you do not object, Shirley. Here,\" she continued, \"I have brought the brace of pistols from my uncle's study. You may examine them at your leisure.\"\nShe placed them on the table before her friend.\n\n\"Why would you rather sit up longer?\" asked Miss Keeldar, taking up the firearms, examining them, and again laying them down.\n\n\"Because I have a strange, excited feeling in my heart.\"\n\n\"So have I.\"\n\n\"Is this state of sleeplessness and restlessness caused by something electrical in the air, I wonder?\"\n\n\"No; the sky is clear, the stars numberless. It is a fine night.\"\n\n\"But very still. I hear the water fret over its stony bed in Hollow's Copse as distinctly as if it ran below the churchyard wall.\"\n\n\"I am glad it is so still a night. A moaning wind or rushing rain would vex me to fever just now.\"\n\n\"Why, Shirley?\"\n\n\"Because it would baffle my efforts to listen.\"\n\n\"Do you listen towards the Hollow?\"\n\n\"Yes; it is the only quarter whence we can hear a sound just now.\"\n\n\"The only one, Shirley.\"\n\nThey both sat near the window, and both leaned their arms on the sill, and both inclined their heads towards the open lattice. They saw each other's young faces by the starlight and that dim June twilight which does not wholly fade from the west till dawn begins to break in the east.\n\n\"Mr. Helstone thinks we have no idea which way he is gone,\" murmured Miss Keeldar, \"nor on what errand, nor with what expectations, nor how prepared. But I guess much; do not you?\"\n\n\"I guess something.\"\n\n\"All those gentlemen\u2014your cousin Moore included\u2014think that you and I are now asleep in our beds, unconscious.\"\n\n\"Caring nothing about them\u2014hoping and fearing nothing for them,\" added Caroline.\n\nBoth kept silent for full half an hour. The night was silent too; only the church clock measured its course by quarters. Some words were interchanged about the chill of the air. They wrapped their scarves closer round them, resumed their bonnets, which they had removed, and again watched.\n\nTowards midnight the teasing, monotonous bark of the house-dog disturbed the quietude of their vigil. Caroline rose, and made her way noiselessly through the dark passages to the kitchen, intending to appease him with a piece of bread. She succeeded. On returning to the dining-room she found it all dark, Miss Keeldar having extinguished the candle. The outline of her shape was visible near the still open window, leaning out. Miss Helstone asked no questions; she stole to her side. The dog recommenced barking furiously. Suddenly he stopped, and seemed to listen. The occupants of the dining-room listened too, and not merely now to the flow of the mill-stream. There was a nearer, though a muffled, sound on the road below the churchyard\u2014a measured, beating, approaching sound\u2014a dull tramp of marching feet.\n\nIt drew near. Those who listened by degrees comprehended its extent. It was not the tread of two, nor of a dozen, nor of a score of men; it was the tread of hundreds. They could see nothing; the high shrubs of the garden formed a leafy screen between them and the road. To hear, however, was not enough, and this they felt as the troop trod forwards, and seemed actually passing the rectory. They felt it more when a human voice\u2014though that voice spoke but one word\u2014broke the hush of the night.\n\n\"Halt!\"\n\nA halt followed. The march was arrested. Then came a low conference, of which no word was distinguishable from the dining-room.\n\n\"We must hear this,\" said Shirley.\n\nShe turned, took her pistols from the table, silently passed out through the middle window of the dining-room, which was, in fact, a glass door, stole down the walk to the garden wall, and stood listening under the lilacs. Caroline would not have quitted the house had she been alone, but where Shirley went she would go. She glanced at the weapon on the sideboard, but left it behind her, and presently stood at her friend's side. They dared not look over the wall, for fear of being seen; they were obliged to crouch behind it. They heard these words,\u2014\n\n\"It looks a rambling old building. Who lives in it besides the damned parson?\"\n\n\"Only three women\u2014his niece and two servants.\"\n\n\"Do you know where they sleep?\"\n\n\"The lasses behind; the niece in a front room.\"\n\n\"And Helstone?\"\n\n\"Yonder is his chamber. He was burning a light, but I see none now.\"\n\n\"Where would you get in?\"\n\n\"If I were ordered to do his job\u2014and he desarves it\u2014I'd try yond' long window; it opens to the dining-room. I could grope my way upstairs, and I know his chamber.\"\n\n\"How would you manage about the women folk?\"\n\n\"Let 'em alone except they shrieked, and then I'd soon quieten 'em. I could wish to find the old chap asleep. If he waked, he'd be dangerous.\"\n\n\"Has he arms?\"\n\n\"Firearms, allus\u2014and allus loadened.\"\n\n\"Then you're a fool to stop us here. A shot would give the alarm. Moore would be on us before we could turn round. We should miss our main object.\"\n\n\"You might go on, I tell you. I'd engage Helstone alone.\"\n\nA pause. One of the party dropped some weapon, which rang on the stone causeway. At this sound the rectory dog barked again furiously\u2014fiercely.\n\n\"That spoils all!\" said the voice. \"He'll awake. A noise like that might rouse the dead. You did not say there was a dog. Damn you! Forward!\"\n\nForward they went\u2014tramp, tramp\u2014with mustering, manifold, slow-filing tread. They were gone.\n\nShirley stood erect, looked over the wall, along the road.\n\n\"Not a soul remains,\" she said.\n\nShe stood and mused. \"Thank God!\" was the next observation.\n\nCaroline repeated the ejaculation\u2014not in so steady a tone. She was trembling much. Her heart was beating fast and thick; her face was cold, her forehead damp.\n\n\"Thank God for us!\" she reiterated. \"But what will happen elsewhere? They have passed us by that they may make sure of others.\"\n\n\"They have done well,\" returned Shirley, with composure. \"The others will defend themselves. They can do it. They are prepared for them. With us it is otherwise. My finger was on the trigger of this pistol. I was quite ready to give that man, if he had entered, such a greeting as he little calculated on; but behind him followed three hundred. I had neither three hundred hands nor three hundred weapons. I could not have effectually protected either you, myself, or the two poor women asleep under that roof. Therefore I again earnestly thank God for insult and peril escaped.\"\n\nAfter a second pause she continued: \"What is it my duty and wisdom to do next? Not to stay here inactive, I am glad to say, but, of course, to walk over to the Hollow.\"\n\n\"To the Hollow, Shirley?\"\n\n\"To the Hollow. Will you go with me?\"\n\n\"Where those men are gone?\"\n\n\"They have taken the highway; we should not encounter them. The road over the fields is as safe, silent, and solitary as a path through the air would be. Will you go?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" was the answer, given mechanically, not because the speaker wished or was prepared to go, or, indeed, was otherwise than scared at the prospect of going, but because she felt she could not abandon Shirley.\n\n\"Then we must fasten up these windows, and leave all as secure as we can behind us. Do you know what we are going for, Cary?\"\n\n\"Yes\u2014no\u2014because you wish it.\"\n\n\"Is that all? And are you so obedient to a mere caprice of mine? What a docile wife you would make to a stern husband! The moon's face is not whiter than yours at this moment, and the aspen at the gate does not tremble more than your busy fingers; and so, tractable and terror-struck, and dismayed and devoted, you would follow me into the thick of real danger! Cary, let me give your fidelity a motive. We are going for Moore's sake\u2014to see if we can be of use to him, to make an effort to warn him of what is coming.\"\n\n\"To be sure! I am a blind, weak fool, and you are acute and sensible, Shirley. I will go with you; I will gladly go with you!\"\n\n\"I do not doubt it. You would die blindly and meekly for me, but you would intelligently and gladly die for Moore. But, in truth, there is no question of death to-night; we run no risk at all.\"\n\nCaroline rapidly closed shutter and lattice. \"Do not fear that I shall not have breath to run as fast as you can possibly run, Shirley. Take my hand. Let us go straight across the fields.\"\n\n\"But you cannot climb walls?\"\n\n\"To-night I can.\"\n\n\"You are afraid of hedges, and the beck which we shall be forced to cross?\"\n\n\"I can cross it.\"\n\nThey started; they ran. Many a wall checked but did not baffle them. Shirley was surefooted and agile; she could spring like a deer when she chose. Caroline, more timid and less dexterous, fell once or twice, and bruised herself; but she rose again directly, saying she was not hurt. A quickset hedge bounded the last field; they lost time in seeking a gap in it. The aperture, when found, was narrow, but they worked their way through. The long hair, the tender skin, the silks and the muslins suffered; but what was chiefly regretted was the impediment this difficulty had caused to speed. On the other side they met the beck, flowing deep in a rough bed. At this point a narrow plank formed the only bridge across it. Shirley had trodden the plank successfully and fearlessly many a time before; Caroline had never yet dared to risk the transit.\n\n\"I will carry you across,\" said Miss Keeldar. \"You are light, and I am not weak. Let me try.\"\n\n\"If I fall in, you may fish me out,\" was the answer, as a grateful squeeze compressed her hand. Caroline, without pausing, trod forward on the trembling plank as if it were a continuation of the firm turf. Shirley, who followed, did not cross it more resolutely or safely. In their present humour, on their present errand, a strong and foaming channel would have been a barrier to neither. At the moment they were above the control either of fire or water. All Stilbro' Moor, alight and aglow with bonfires, would not have stopped them, nor would Calder or Aire thundering in flood. Yet one sound made them pause. Scarce had they set foot on the solid opposite bank when a shot split the air from the north. One second elapsed. Further off burst a like note in the south. Within the space of three minutes similar signals boomed in the east and west.\n\n\"I thought we were dead at the first explosion,\" observed Shirley, drawing a long breath. \"I felt myself hit in the temples, and I concluded your heart was pierced; but the reiterated voice was an explanation. Those are signals\u2014it is their way\u2014the attack must be near. We should have had wings. Our feet have not borne us swiftly enough.\"\n\nA portion of the copse was now to clear. When they emerged from it the mill lay just below them. They could look down upon the buildings, the yard; they could see the road beyond. And the first glance in that direction told Shirley she was right in her conjecture. They were already too late to give warning. It had taken more time than they calculated on to overcome the various obstacles which embarrassed the short cut across the fields.\n\nThe road, which should have been white, was dark with a moving mass. The rioters were assembled in front of the closed yard gates, and a single figure stood within, apparently addressing them. The mill itself was perfectly black and still. There was neither life, light, nor motion around it.\n\n\"Surely he is prepared. Surely that is not Moore meeting them alone?\" whispered Shirley.\n\n\"It is. We must go to him. I will go to him.\"\n\n\"That you will not.\"\n\n\"Why did I come, then? I came only for him. I shall join him.\"\n\n\"Fortunately it is out of your power. There is no entrance to the yard.\"\n\n\"There is a small entrance at the back, besides the gates in front. It opens by a secret method which I know. I will try it.\"\n\n\"Not with my leave.\"\n\nMiss Keeldar clasped her round the waist with both arms and held her back. \"Not one step shall you stir,\" she went on authoritatively. \"At this moment Moore would be both shocked and embarrassed if he saw either you or me. Men never want women near them in time of real danger.\"\n\n\"I would not trouble\u2014I would help him,\" was the reply.\n\n\"How?\u2014by inspiring him with heroism? Pooh! these are not the days of chivalry. It is not a tilt at a tournament we are going to behold, but a struggle about money, and food, and life.\"\n\n\"It is natural that I should be at his side.\"\n\n\"As queen of his heart? His mill is his lady-love, Cary! Backed by his factory and his frames, he has all the encouragement he wants or can know. It is not for love or beauty, but for ledger and broadcloth, he is going to break a spear. Don't be sentimental; Robert is not so.\"\n\n\"I could help him; I will seek him.\"\n\n\"Off then\u2014I let you go\u2014seek Moore. You'll not find him.\"\n\nShe loosened her hold. Caroline sped like levelled shaft from bent bow; after her rang a jesting, gibing laugh. \"Look well there is no mistake!\" was the warning given.\n\nBut there was a mistake. Miss Helstone paused, hesitated, gazed. The figure had suddenly retreated from the gate, and was running back hastily to the mill.\n\n\"Make haste, Lina!\" cried Shirley; \"meet him before he enters.\"\n\nCaroline slowly returned. \"It is not Robert,\" she said. \"It has neither his height, form, nor bearing.\"\n\n\"I saw it was not Robert when I let you go. How could you imagine it? It is a shabby little figure of a private soldier; they had posted him as sentinel. He is safe in the mill now. I saw the door open and admit him. My mind grows easier. Robert is prepared. Our warning would have been superfluous; and now I am thankful we came too late to give it. It has saved us the trouble of a scene. How fine to have entered the counting-house toute \u00e9perdue, and to have found oneself in presence of Messrs. Armitage and Ramsden smoking, Malone swaggering, your uncle sneering, Mr. Sykes sipping a cordial, and Moore himself in his cold man-of-business vein! I am glad we missed it all.\"\n\n\"I wonder if there are many in the mill, Shirley!\"\n\n\"Plenty to defend it. The soldiers we have twice seen to-day were going there, no doubt, and the group we noticed surrounding your cousin in the fields will be with him.\"\n\n\"What are they doing now, Shirley? What is that noise?\"\n\n\"Hatchets and crowbars against the yard gates. They are forcing them. Are you afraid?\"\n\n\"No; but my heart throbs fast. I have a difficulty in standing. I will sit down. Do you feel unmoved?\"\n\n\"Hardly that; but I am glad I came. We shall see what transpires with our own eyes. We are here on the spot, and none know it. Instead of amazing the curate, the clothier, and the corn-dealer with a romantic rush on the stage, we stand alone with the friendly night, its mute stars, and these whispering trees, whose report our friends will not come to gather.\"\n\n\"Shirley, Shirley, the gates are down! That crash was like the felling of great trees. Now they are pouring through. They will break down the mill doors as they have broken the gate. What can Robert do against so many? Would to God I were a little nearer him\u2014could hear him speak\u2014could speak to him! With my will\u2014my longing to serve him\u2014I could not be a useless burden in his way; I could be turned to some account.\"\n\n\"They come on!\" cried Shirley. \"How steadily they march in! There is discipline in their ranks. I will not say there is courage\u2014hundreds against tens are no proof of that quality\u2014but\" (she dropped her voice) \"there is suffering and desperation enough amongst them. These goads will urge them forwards.\"\n\n\"Forwards against Robert; and they hate him. Shirley, is there much danger they will win the day?\"\n\n\"We shall see. Moore and Helstone are of 'earth's first blood'\u2014no bunglers\u2014no cravens\u2014\u2014\"\n\nA crash\u2014smash\u2014shiver\u2014stopped their whispers. A simultaneously hurled volley of stones had saluted the broad front of the mill, with all its windows; and now every pane of every lattice lay in shattered and pounded fragments. A yell followed this demonstration\u2014a rioters' yell\u2014a north-of-England, a Yorkshire, a West-Riding, a West-Riding-clothing-district-of-Yorkshire rioters' yell.\n\nYou never heard that sound, perhaps, reader? So much the better for your ears\u2014perhaps for your heart, since, if it rends the air in hate to yourself, or to the men or principles you approve, the interests to which you wish well, wrath wakens to the cry of hate; the lion shakes his mane, and rises to the howl of the hyena; caste stands up, ireful against caste; and the indignant, wronged spirit of the middle rank bears down in zeal and scorn on the famished and furious mass of the operative class. It is difficult to be tolerant, difficult to be just, in such moments.\n\nCaroline rose; Shirley put her arm round her: they stood together as still as the straight stems of two trees. That yell was a long one, and when it ceased the night was yet full of the swaying and murmuring of a crowd.\n\n\"What next?\" was the question of the listeners. Nothing came yet. The mill remained mute as a mausoleum.\n\n\"He cannot be alone!\" whispered Caroline.\n\n\"I would stake all I have that he is as little alone as he is alarmed,\" responded Shirley.\n\nShots were discharged by the rioters. Had the defenders waited for this signal? It seemed so. The hitherto inert and passive mill woke; fire flashed from its empty window-frames; a volley of musketry pealed sharp through the Hollow.\n\n\"Moore speaks at last!\" said Shirley, \"and he seems to have the gift of tongues. That was not a single voice.\"\n\n\"He has been forbearing. No one can accuse him of rashness,\" alleged Caroline. \"Their discharge preceded his. They broke his gates and his windows. They fired at his garrison before he repelled them.\"\n\nWhat was going on now? It seemed difficult, in the darkness, to distinguish; but something terrible, a still-renewing tumult, was obvious\u2014fierce attacks, desperate repulses. The mill-yard, the mill itself, was full of battle movement. There was scarcely any cessation now of the discharge of firearms; and there was struggling, rushing, trampling, and shouting between. The aim of the assailants seemed to be to enter the mill, that of the defenders to beat them off. They heard the rebel leader cry, \"To the back, lads!\" They heard a voice retort, \"Come round; we will meet you.\"\n\n\"To the counting-house!\" was the order again.\n\n\"Welcome! we shall have you there!\" was the response. And accordingly the fiercest blaze that had yet glowed, the loudest rattle that had yet been heard, burst from the counting-house front when the mass of rioters rushed up to it.\n\nThe voice that had spoken was Moore's own voice. They could tell by its tones that his soul was now warm with the conflict; they could guess that the fighting animal was roused in every one of those men there struggling together, and was for the time quite paramount above the rational human being.\n\nBoth the girls felt their faces glow and their pulses throb; both knew they would do no good by rushing down into the m\u00eal\u00e9e. They desired neither to deal nor to receive blows; but they could not have run away\u2014Caroline no more than Shirley; they could not have fainted; they could not have taken their eyes from the dim, terrible scene\u2014from the mass of cloud, of smoke, the musket-lightning\u2014for the world.\n\n\"How and when would it end?\" was the demand throbbing in their throbbing pulses. \"Would a juncture arise in which they could be useful?\" was what they waited to see; for though Shirley put off their too-late arrival with a jest, and was ever ready to satirize her own or any other person's enthusiasm, she would have given a farm of her best land for a chance of rendering good service.\n\nThe chance was not vouchsafed her; the looked-for juncture never came. It was not likely. Moore had expected this attack for days, perhaps weeks; he was prepared for it at every point. He had fortified and garrisoned his mill, which in itself was a strong building. He was a cool, brave man; he stood to the defence with unflinching firmness. Those who were with him caught his spirit, and copied his demeanour. The rioters had never been so met before. At other mills they had attacked they had found no resistance; an organized, resolute defence was what they never dreamed of encountering. When their leaders saw the steady fire kept up from the mill, witnessed the composure and determination of its owner, heard themselves coolly defied and invited on to death, and beheld their men falling wounded round them, they felt that nothing was to be done here. In haste they mustered their forces, drew them away from the building. A roll was called over, in which the men answered to figures instead of names. They dispersed wide over the fields, leaving silence and ruin behind them. The attack, from its commencement to its termination, had not occupied an hour.\n\nDay was by this time approaching; the west was dim, the east beginning to gleam. It would have seemed that the girls who had watched this conflict would now wish to hasten to the victors, on whose side all their interest had been enlisted; but they only very cautiously approached the now battered mill, and when suddenly a number of soldiers and gentlemen appeared at the great door opening into the yard, they quickly stepped aside into a shed, the deposit of old iron and timber, whence they could see without being seen.\n\nIt was no cheering spectacle. These premises were now a mere blot of desolation on the fresh front of the summer dawn. All the copse up the Hollow was shady and dewy, the hill at its head was green; but just here, in the centre of the sweet glen, Discord, broken loose in the night from control, had beaten the ground with his stamping hoofs, and left it waste and pulverized. The mill yawned all ruinous with unglazed frames; the yard was thickly bestrewn with stones and brickbats; and close under the mill, with the glittering fragments of the shattered windows, muskets and other weapons lay here and there. More than one deep crimson stain was visible on the gravel, a human body lay quiet on its face near the gates, and five or six wounded men writhed and moaned in the bloody dust.\n\nMiss Keeldar's countenance changed at this view. It was the after-taste of the battle, death and pain replacing excitement and exertion. It was the blackness the bright fire leaves when its blaze is sunk, its warmth failed, and its glow faded.\n\n\"This is what I wished to prevent,\" she said, in a voice whose cadence betrayed the altered impulse of her heart.\n\n\"But you could not prevent it; you did your best\u2014it was in vain,\" said Caroline comfortingly. \"Don't grieve, Shirley.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for those poor fellows,\" was the answer, while the spark in her glance dissolved to dew. \"Are any within the mill hurt, I wonder? Is that your uncle?\"\n\n\"It is, and there is Mr. Malone; and, O Shirley, there is Robert!\"\n\n\"Well\" (resuming her former tone), \"don't squeeze your fingers quite into my hand. I see. There is nothing wonderful in that. We knew he, at least, was here, whoever might be absent.\"\n\n\"He is coming here towards us, Shirley!\"\n\n\"Towards the pump, that is to say, for the purpose of washing his hands and his forehead, which has got a scratch, I perceive.\"\n\n\"He bleeds, Shirley. Don't hold me. I must go.\"\n\n\"Not a step.\"\n\n\"He is hurt, Shirley!\"\n\n\"Fiddlestick!\"\n\n\"But I must go to him. I wish to go so much. I cannot bear to be restrained.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To speak to him, to ask how he is, and what I can do for him.\"\n\n\"To tease and annoy him; to make a spectacle of yourself and him before those soldiers, Mr. Malone, your uncle, et cetera. Would he like it, think you? Would you like to remember it a week hence?\"\n\n\"Am I always to be curbed and kept down?\" demanded Caroline, a little passionately.\n\n\"For his sake, yes; and still more for your own. I tell you, if you showed yourself now you would repent it an hour hence, and so would Robert.\"\n\n\"You think he would not like it, Shirley?\"\n\n\"Far less than he would like our stopping him to say good-night, which you were so sore about.\"\n\n\"But that was all play; there was no danger.\"\n\n\"And this is serious work; he must be unmolested.\"\n\n\"I only wish to go to him because he is my cousin\u2014you understand?\"\n\n\"I quite understand. But now, watch him. He has bathed his forehead, and the blood has ceased trickling. His hurt is really a mere graze; I can see it from hence. He is going to look after the wounded men.\"\n\nAccordingly Mr. Moore and Mr. Helstone went round the yard, examining each prostrate form. They then gave directions to have the wounded taken up and carried into the mill. This duty being performed, Joe Scott was ordered to saddle his master's horse and Mr. Helstone's pony, and the two gentlemen rode away full gallop, to seek surgical aid in different directions.\n\nCaroline was not yet pacified.\n\n\"Shirley, Shirley, I should have liked to speak one word to him before he went,\" she murmured, while the tears gathered glittering in her eyes.\n\n\"Why do you cry, Lina?\" asked Miss Keeldar a little sternly. \"You ought to be glad instead of sorry. Robert has escaped any serious harm; he is victorious; he has been cool and brave in combat; he is now considerate in triumph. Is this a time\u2014are these causes for weeping?\"\n\n\"You do not know what I have in my heart,\" pleaded the other\u2014\"what pain, what distraction\u2014nor whence it arises. I can understand that you should exult in Robert's greatness and goodness; so do I, in one sense, but in another I feel so miserable. I am too far removed from him. I used to be nearer. Let me alone, Shirley. Do let me cry a few minutes; it relieves me.\"\n\nMiss Keeldar, feeling her tremble in every limb, ceased to expostulate with her. She went out of the shed, and left her to weep in peace. It was the best plan. In a few minutes Caroline rejoined her, much calmer. She said, with her natural, docile, gentle manner, \"Come, Shirley, we will go home now. I promise not to try to see Robert again till he asks for me. I never will try to push myself on him. I thank you for restraining me just now.\"\n\n\"I did it with a good intention,\" returned Miss Keeldar.\n\n\"Now, dear Lina,\" she continued, \"let us turn our faces to the cool morning breeze, and walk very quietly back to the rectory. We will steal in as we stole out. None shall know where we have been or what we have seen to-night; neither taunt nor misconstruction can consequently molest us. To-morrow we will see Robert, and be of good cheer; but I will say no more, lest I should begin to cry too. I seem hard towards you, but I am not so.\"Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/7050902", "artist_names": "Christian Genius", "full_title": "July 2021 Singles Release Calendar by\u00a0Christian\u00a0Genius", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/f5d6bfd8219f4c4783b88342d3319aed.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f5d6bfd8219f4c4783b88342d3319aed.866x866x1.png", "id": 7050902, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 2430266, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1656804464, "path": "/Christian-genius-july-2021-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Christian-genius-july-2021-singles-release-calendar-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2021, "month": 7, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "July 2021", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jul. 2021", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/f5d6bfd8219f4c4783b88342d3319aed.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f5d6bfd8219f4c4783b88342d3319aed.866x866x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "July 2021 Singles Release Calendar", "title_with_featured": "July 2021 Singles Release Calendar", "updated_by_human_at": 1656804464, "url": "https://genius.com/Christian-genius-july-2021-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/528115", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c57db1ca677a272a4dfdadd7b701ce29.262x262x1.jpg", "id": 528115, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0fae0945bbc7dd4920ee70a9419c10ef.262x262x1.png", "index_character": "c", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": true, "name": "Christian Genius", "slug": "Christian-genius", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Christian-genius", "iq": 20392}, "artist": "Christian Genius", "lyrics": "July 2021 Singles Release Calendar Lyrics7/1Him & Her - \"Mercy Seat\"\nNEEDTOBREATHE - \"Chances\"7/2Aaron Cole - \"ABOVE ME\" feat.
