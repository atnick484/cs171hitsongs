making my own decisions\nThis thing that I found ain't gonna bring me down\nI'm like a junkie without an addiction\nMama, don't cry, I just wanna stay high\nLike playing with danger and fear\nEverybody's walking, but nobody's talking\nIt looks a lot better from here\n[Chorus]\nAll my life I've been over the top\nI don't know what I'm doing, all I know is I don't wanna stop\nAll fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop\nYou're either in or in the way, don't make me, I don't wanna stop\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy don't they ever listen to me?\nIt's just a one-way conversation\nNothing they say is gonna set me free\nDon't need no mental masturbation\nToo many religions, but only one God\nI don't need another savior\nDon't try to change my mind, you know I'm one of a kind\nAin't gonna change my bad behavior\n\n[Chorus]\nAll my life, I've been over the top\nI don't know what I'm doing, all I know is I don't wanna stop\nAll fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop\nYou're either in or in the way,

from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind\nAnd the border meant freedom, a new life, romance\nAnd that's why I thought I should go\nAnd start my life over on the seashores of old Mexico\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy first night in Juarez, lost all the money I had\nOne bad senorita made use of one innocent lad\nBut I must keep on running; it's too late to turn back\nI'm wanted in Tucson, I'm told\nYeah, and things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico\n[Verse 3]\nTwo Mexican farmers en route to a town I can't say\nLet me ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay\nDown through Durango, Colima, Almiera\nThen in the Manzanillos\nWhere I slept in the sunshine on the seashores of old Mexico\n\n[Verse 4]\nAfter one long siesta, I came wide awake in the night\nI was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight\nMy new-found companion, one young senorita\nWho offered a broken hello\nTo the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico\n\n[Verse 5]\nShe spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return\nFor her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern\nCause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo\nThat's all I needed to know\nYeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo\nThat's all I needed to know, ha, ha\nYeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of

make you\nMake the call that having no life at all is better than the life that you had?\nHow do you feel so empty you want to let it all go?\nHow do you get that lonely and nobody know?\nDid his girlfriend break up with him?\nDid he buy or steal that gun?\nDid his mom and daddy forget to say \"I love you, son?\"\nDid no one see the writing on the wall?\n\nI'm not blamin' anybody\nWe all do the best we can\nI know hindsight's 20/20\nBut I still don't understand\n\nHow do you get that lonely?\nHow do you hurt that bad to make you\nMake the call that having no life at all was better than

hard being me\n[Chorus]\nLiving in the shadow\nOf someone else's dream\nTryna find a hand to hold, but every touch felt cold to me\nLiving in a nightmare\nA never-ending sleep\nBut now that I am wide awake\nMy chains are finally free\nDon't feel sorry for me\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll the days collided\nOne less perfect than the next\nI was stuck inside someone else's life and always second best\nOh, I love you now, 'cause now I realize\nThat it's safe outside to come alive in my identity\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nSo if you're listening\nThere's so much more to me you haven't seen\n\n[Chorus]\nLiving in the shadow\nOf someone else's dream\nTryna find a hand to hold, but every touch felt cold to me\nLiving in a nightmare\nA never-ending sleep\nBut now that I am wide awake\nThen I can finally

me\nPuffy was right it's all about the benjie's\nBitter now cuz the loves still in me\nIn my boxers on couch, sippin' Remy\nThinkin' that she need to be killed like Kennedy\nThen I listen to I got the

stupid\n\n[Hook 2x]\n\n[J-Kwon talkin over music]\nYou know, you feal my story\nWrite me or something ya know what I'm sayin\nOr I'll be in a town near you or, or\nYour town or whatever ya know\nCome

more\nAnd your crew's all but know it's a horse\nGot the Don all warm and it ain't the Hen'\nFeelin' like the Don woman, you could wrestle her chin\nShorty, come a little closer while the record spin\nI wanna freak a little longer, can they play it again\n\nRepeat 1\n\nYo, got my mind on my money, money on my mind\nAnd to let you know, you just as good as gold\nIt's like we got our own little private party goin' on\nAnd the scene just changed into shores of San Juan\nIt's so intimate, we so into it\nSuch a tender thing, but fuck I'm innocent\nGrindin' so hard you gotta know what I'm thinkin'\nLaughin' cuz I'mma kidnap you for the weekend\nNow we at the pad about to crack a case\nPlayin' the couch like Ceasar's, she feedin' me grapes\nNot for nuttin' hon, the sex is great\nBut you

split\nIf not, I got a girl for every girl I get\nThere's a drop in the lot and it whip so fast\nWe hit the swiss hotel before you finish your glass\nAnd you know you wanna be where the cake is at\nWhere the pockets just like calories, extra fat\nMami, your body like Malery on Natural Born Killer\nShe like, they got money but ya'll are more realer\nShe wanna roll wit' us, pretty much to

going down\nI'm city to city, town to town\nThey runnin' up screamin' my name\nRunnin' up, grabbin' my chain\nRunnin' up, tryna get in the game\nI'm like Ma, don't get it twisted\nIf we kick it, get your bark on\nHope to God you see me again, when I'm grown\nType of playa, but it ain't\nIt just sounds like that\n'Cause I'm just too young to get down like that\n(I agree)\nHit the movies, hit the mall\nThen come out with big bags\nNext day, do lunch then head to Six Flags\nBut it don't mean nothin' we're just having some fun\nEven though I may have told you on the ride you're the one\nI'm sorry, little shorty, I gotta take that back\n'Cause I'm just too young to get down like that\nSo\nYou might also like[Chorus: Lil Bow Wow & Jagged Edge]\nYou can't believe\nNot a word that I be

me\nAnd caught yourself noticing me\nIn my mind, set don't change\nI might up my game\nBut the story that I tell 'em\nWhen I tell it, it remains the same\nYou wouldn't believe how they be comin' at me\nSteady, steady tryna throw somethin' at me\nLike I'ma get happy\nJust because honey got her learner's permit\nCan come and scoop me after school\nLike I'm supposed to be on it\nNaw ain't no sippin' over here\nIt's Big Pimpin' over here\nAnd I hope that I make myself clear\nThat when it comes to honeys, yo I got too many\nAnd I ain't tryna get serious ti'l I'm up in my twenties\nIt's just the paper that I'm after\nThe drop with the top I'ma cop when I'm able\nAnd that's all that matters\nSo if I told you somethin', shorty\nI'm taking that back\n'Cause I'm just too young to get down

ain't that deep\nI finally changed my number\nGot a different pager\nThen last Saturday\nYour cousin called to say you're\nTryin' to reach me\nProbably because you see that\nI'm with someone new\n\n[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Snoop Dogg]\nLate at night like a little child\nWandering around alone in my new friend's home (all alone)\n(Dry your eyes, dry your eyes)\nOn my tippy toes\nSo that he

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now\n\nEnjoy the power and beauty of your youth; or never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine\n\nDon't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing\nBubblegum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that\nNever crossed your worried mind; the kind that blindside you at 4 PM on some idle Tuesday\nDo one thing every day that scares you\n\nSing\n\nDon't be reckless with other people's hearts; don't put up with people who are reckless with yours\n\nFloss\n\nDon't waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself\n\nRemember the compliments you receive; forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how\n\nKeep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements\n\nStretch\n\nDon't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives.

Lyrics{*Jon B. harmonizing*}\n\n[WC]\nNineteen-ninety-eight\nDamn, I can't believe it\nWhoever thought, throughout the drama, we'd live to see it\nSo many of us done lost lives to the streets\nAs we reminisce, I'm pourin' liquor for the deceased\nThink about the times that I spent with many of 'em\nHopin' that the Lord let me see the millenium\nTrapped in this ghetto main, seekin' better days\nFightin' for my conscience, tryin' to shake these wicked ways\nI know it's wrong, but it's hard to change\nAll my life, all I ever knew was hustle and game\nLookin' for answers ever since I was a adolescent\nFaced with rejection, early age stressin'\nBut now, ten years later, with doodoo respect\nI'm bustin' million dollar raps and six digit checks\nShowin' love to my peeps and my love don't change\nHere's a toast to you fakes\nHuh\nHere's to better days\n[Chorus: Jon B.]\nIt might sound strange\nBut I\nJust, can't, run away\nI just can't run\nI never can't run (Run away)\nIt might sound strange\nBut I\nJust, can't, run away\nI never can run away\nYeah\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2][WC]\nTouch a meal ticket, shake a spot for good\nNever\nI still got love for the neighborhood\nAnd even though now it's infested with gunplay\nOn most days, like Bootsy, I can't stay away\nCause if I shook like y'all shook on me\nThen whose gon' stay and guide the way for the lil' homies?\nI can't turn my head on my folks\nSo I stay visible in these streets and try to give hope\nBorn in the ghetto\nRaised in the ghetto\nGot love for the ghetto\nI can't forget the ghetto\nHow come everytime we get some change in our can\nWe run away and try to move out as far as we can?\nI know that jealousy's the devil's greed, but you worse\nThan a devil when you turn your back on these young G's\nNow feel every word that I say\nHear my cry\nAs I struggle out of thirst and search for better days\nYou might also like[Repeat Chorus]\n\n[Jon B.]\nIt might sound strange\nBut I\nJust, can't, run away\nI just can't run\nI never can't run (Run away)\nIt might sound strange\n\n[Verse 3][WC]\nAnother day another dollar\nIt feels good\nTo look around and see I'm surrounded by real riders\nChildhood comrades I ran with for years\nShared the same beer and tears over the same peers\nPlayer haters swearin' that all we all G's\nOff each others strength with these\nRegulates the same cheese\nNo jealousy, we all family like Sister Sledge\nLace each other with game\nSo I can spin beer cans\nWatch our kids grow together\nAs we get old together\nLoc, I mean this, let no one come in between this\nKeep our business among us, behind doors\nAnd eyes closed, on those we consider as foes\nOutsiders never exposed to your hustle\nPlus I'm\nNever been one likely to trust 'em\nNo negative association, just dedication\nTo watch our paper sprout like this bud mutation\n[Repeat Chorus]\n\n[Jon B.] + {WC in background}\nI, can't (I don't wanna run) {I can't run}\nI never can't run (I wanna sleep right here)

sit and rave and rant (come on)\nYour name is out my mouth like an ancient chant (say what?)\nGot me like a dog as I pause and pant\n*heavy breathing*\n[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]\nSpeaking of which\nGot a

take to drinking, boy, that road don't lead no where\nAnd don't you ever let me hear you swear\nDon't you dare.\"\nHe told me stealing is a lazy man's way\nSomething for nothing leaves you hell to pay so don't buy into it\nAnd then you can look the whole world in the eye\nHoney, I've tried\nBut since I met you girl I'm breaking every rule\nI must confess I'm just a back sliding fool\n[Chorus]\nI want to drink from your loving cup\nSwear I'll never give you up\nSteal all your kisses underneath the moon\nI wanna lie here close to you, look at what you made me do\nDarling you're the reason why\nI drink, swear, steal and lie\n\n[Verse 2]\nLast night I threw away the 12 step book\nI finally faced the fact that I am hooked on you\nThere's nothing more that I can do, Ain't no use\nCause every time I see your angel face\nMy halo disappears without a trace I swear\nGirl, I'd admit I haven't got a prayer\nBut I don't care\nI know this ain't exactly how I was raised\nBut heaven help me, honey, I ain't changing my ways\n\n[Chorus]\nI want to drink from your loving cup\nSwear I'll never give you up\nSteal all your kisses underneath the moon\nI wanna lie here close to you, look at what you made me do\nDarling you're the reason why\nI drink, swear, steal and lie\nYou might also likeI want to drink from your loving cup\nSwear I'll never give you up\nSteal all your kisses underneath

Evans]\nWhen I was little, my father was famous\nHe was the greatest samurai in the empire\nAnd he was the Shogun's decapitator\nHe cut off the heads of 131 lords\nIt was a bad time for the empire\nThe Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out\nPeople said his brain was infected by devils\nMy father would come home, he would forget about the killings\nHe wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him\nMaybe that was the problem\nThen, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house\nThey were supposed to kill my father but they didn't\nThat was the night everything changed\n[Intro: RZA]\nSee, sometimes\nYou gotta flash 'em back\nSee, niggas don't know where this shit started\nY'all know where it came from\nI'm sayin', we gonna take y'all back to the source\nDo the knowledge, yo\n[Chorus: RZA + GZA]\nWhen the MC's came to live out the name\nAnd to perform, some had\nTo snort cocaine, to act insane\nBefore Pete Rocked it on\nNow on with the mental plane, to spark the brain\nWith the building to be born\nYo, RZA, flip the track with the what to cut\n\n[Verse 1: GZA]\nFake niggas get flipped in mic fights\nI swing swords and cut clowns\nShit is too swift to bite, you record and write it down\nI flow like the blood on a murder scene\nLike a syringe, on some wild out shit to insert a fiend\nBut it was your op. to shop stolen art\nCatch a swollen heart from not rollin' smart\nI put mad pressure on phony wack rhymes that get hurt\nShit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirts\nThat's minimum and feminine like sandals\nMy minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble\nEnergy is felt once the cards are dealt\nWith the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts\nThat attack the mic-phones like cyclones or typhoon\nI represent from midnight to high noon\nI don't waste ink, nigga, I think\nI drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink\n'Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed\nThrough clouds of smoke of natural blends of weed\nOnly under one circumstance, that's if I'm blunted\nTurn that shit up, my Clan in Da Front want it\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nNow, when the MC's came to live out the

with the what to cut\n\n[Verse 2: GZA]\nI'm on a Mission that niggas say is Impossible\nBut when I swing my swords, they all choppable\nI be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper\nChild educator, plus head amputator\n'Cause niggas' styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers\nLyrics are weak like clock radio speakers\nDon't even stop in my station and attack\nWhile your plan failed, get derailed like

paparazzi, (making you bitches crash like Lady Di)\nYou scared inside (your hair goes white), you need that lady dye\n(You bet ya' life, it's a man's game, you roll with lady die\nSo if you roll like lady die), your car might roll like Lady Di\nCatch me on a roll, (you ladies die\nYou might suspect that we trolling and just wasting time\nThis is the face of a man who gave up cash and paid the flights\nFor two assholes who brought 80 lines 'bout Lady Di)\nAnd looking at that face I think he mighta changed his mind\n(Now if Lady Di had stayed alive-) Nah come on he broke the bank for this fight\n(He was anxious to write)\nBoth their [?] gave us badge, (each)\nNow we plan to get right\n(We don't care if anyone at ringside knows)\nWe brought strictly inside jokes\n(So if we the only ones laughing all night), that is alright\nI don't care if you catch one line, (faggot, thanks for the flight)\nI'm a hater, (I hate Eurgh\nAnd I don't know if he still with his girl, but I hate her\nHe doing way worse since he hit Vendetta to throw down\nYou may a' edged DNA in some close rounds\nBut I decapitated that queen's head in his hometown\nIt's back to Loe Henry VIII, OT for Tantrum Pesc'\nTake that Kung Lao fitted, and throw it at his neck)\nSee this is Rowan's last event I swear he won't be back again\nHe just limps into the future when we stone him half to death\nNow you're the only battle vet that's got post-traumatic stress just to know what happens next even though it hasn't (yet\nYou greedy sack of shit, he gets annoyed real fast\nBut yo, motherfucker we know that you gon' be here with your broke and annoying staff\nSo battle events are temper tantrums), you throw the biggest in the U.K\n*Both* It's your Fifth Birthday, of course you gon' act like a spoiled brat\n(And your battle with Illmac, it's like you was in a foreign place\nYou collapsed when the pressure kept rising like) *Both* mortgage rates\n(Now when you in Westminster, and drive by that street Portland Place\nYou see Greg's short lil' face)\nAnd before that day, (you was arrogant like 'ho, please'\nBut now this sucker is reluctant to even battle in his own league)\nWe treat Rowan like roe and roll him up we here for sushi\n(See Eurgh chin split in half then scoop out a piece of uni)\nYou make Kanye West look humble, what's gotten into this guy\nWatch during the title match, (he'll get that jealous twitch in his eye)\nHe'll push Chris to the side, like 'I'ma let you finish your line\nBut my third against Pumpkinhead was the greatest shit of all time'\n(He always keeps this piece of shit by his side, relying on teamwork)\nBut forget him for now, (we're here to see), are you G (Eurgh)?\nSpell it out, you hear that (C)-R-U-G-(er\nWe did not even come here with the intention to spit the illest verses)\nI just came to tell the pretty version of Mickey Worthless\n(But seriously though guv, you're a really fucking shitty person\nYou're a cock-dibbler, it doesn't matter\nYou're just here to fucking get on one knee and ask Freddie Scott-Miller for his fucking wedding finger)\n[Verse 1: Eurgh & (Cruger)]\nYou gotta understand how I'm repping this way\nIt don't really matter if the fucking flights I get you are paid\n'Cause I might, reach for the fucking machete today and, fuck tryna edge DNA\nI'll put Pesci's DNA on the edge of my blade\nAnd don't make me angry\n'Cause if you had a blade, it'd be one of them fucking pussy ones that Sikhs carry\nAnd he said that I'm as arrogant as Kanye West, I think you got the wrong guy\n'Cause you would run home straight away, if he put a picture topless online\nBut who's happy to see us battling? They're like 'What took so long?'\nIt's only been like what, two years, they think our foothold's gone\nSo using these two, as punching bags, what really could go wrong?\nIt's a Ralph Lauren sweater, I look good if I put Loe on\n(And your name is Bender, how could you call that your name?\nAll I can say is that's almost as gay as having another man's balls in your face\nImagine a guest list to a club, they're crossing off names with a pen\n'What's your name?' 'Bender' 'Pfft, say that again'\nThey allow him in, he's tryna find a chick down with him\nYou say you're a rapper from Canada, think how she'll cringe\nThen you say your name's Bender and she spits out her drink\n'Cause you're in England I think you should switch names now\nBut your real name's Alex, so even then you're Big Gay Al)\nYour real name's Alex? Nah I'm joking I ain't really got bars for that\nBut your surname's Buchanan? I could really have a laugh at that\nYou'd probably suck my dick, I wouldn't ask for cash\nIf I'm talking head you'd kneel Buchanan, Art Attack\nAnd if they're a gay couple, you're the bitch, and you're the butcher Bender\nPlus you look like a statue, I seen outside a butcher's Bender\nYou were bars and flows, now it's how you spark the chrome\nYour printer running out of ink's the only time you seen a cartridge Loe\n(And Daylyt wiped the smile off your face with the ball sweat he wiped across it\nYou got punked with his sex pistol, but never mind the bollocks\nYou thought you had some style but nobody likes this prick\nYou're a sundial, Daylyt had to mark you out to show you what time it is)\nSo you know when you go to airports, you always get them same guys\nWho wait by arrivals holding paper up with names typed\nWell when I went to Heathrow, to go collect Daylyt\nPesci was stood right there holding a 'No Ball Game' sign\n(Nobody knows after that battle how he's been\nI can't tell if it's tears or ball sweat traveling down his cheek\nEver since then, when he's having chowders he\nSits curled up in a ball crying, with his hands around his knees)\nNow referencing battles in battles is wack, but this'll be fun\nHe's had a couple sick performances, I'm reminiscing on one\nRemember that old clash where Mischief got punked\nInstead of spitting his gum, he took it out with his finger and thumb\nNow listen, rap battle events, germ transmission is done\nHow many wash their hands after pissing, realistically none\nSo doing this with your hand, simply becomes\nHe's putting three hundred other dude's dicks on your tongue\nSo you put a load of dude's dicks, on your gums essentially\nThen another man's balls, got rubbed on Pesci's cheek\nSo if you talk all of that, add it up collectively\nYou have gradually sucked a dick, unintentionally\n(For that one moment you'll forever be a joke\nHe wiped ball sweat on your face, that's sexual assault\nI think you kinda liked it 'cause you never hit him so\nI'm mentioning you both when I say he's a bender on the low\nI know you're jealous of Charron, but Pesci let it go\nYou hate that he's got Arsonal, but it makes sense that's who he chose\nYou wanted to be the one getting Smack rappers, but you ain't ever getting close)\nNah nah nah, apart from, him versus T-Rex, (yeah, when he never showed)\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Bender & (Loe Pesci)]\n(When you went to the airport yesterday, you see Loe\nDaylyt landed but never connected at Heathrow)\nCruger, you look like, I'm on acid, this is visually strange\nThis ugly mug's making me question, if I'm clinically sane\nYou look like the infancy stage of a squiggly face, drawn by Richard D. James after he binged for three days\n(This outcast got a babyface)\nYeah, of a baby made during incest that died of crib death in '88\nNow, that head on that body's so awkward I swear he's built\nLike if you lift his shirt you see a couple of toddlers on a pair of stilts\n(Now here's some facts there's no escape from\nHe's overrated and no one rates him\nHe's overpaid and no one pays him\nHis shoulder blades are bony raisins\nAn athlete is what he hoped to be, to reach the Olympics was his golden dream\nBut with noodle arms like that, how the fuck are you on Rowan team?)\nSo get the ambulance ready for this strand of spaghetti stand up against me I'm landing a heavy smacking you Freddie\nI can't wait until your new album's packaged and ready\n'Cause that's bound to be a classic, like Matter and Pesci\n(What the fuck? Yo I'm using this here check to pay my rent\nBender, how come you haven't gotten paid a cent and swear to God that you versus Bamalam's a main event?)\nFace it Fred, you look like a Mongoloid when you read your verses\n(But he's even worse with picking up girls than Stephen Merchant)\nYou well-known maybe, (but you say 'Hello ladies)\nThey look you up and down like, ('Hell no), *both* pay me!\n(You got fame in Britain Fred, how come you haven't rocked no bitches yet?\nWhen we describe you's the only time you got a little head)\nAnd your crib is fresh, shit you could afford a timeshare, (and flight fare to fly there)\nLike two [?], two pence for every girl who said ('Freddie, you're in my nightmares')\nLast time I went to his town, here's how the visit went down\nSpecifically how we dropped by in his crib for a spliff and then we bounced\nMe and Osa went to Camden, for some pitchers of stout\nSipped a few rounds, and shit I guess the kid just blacked out\nI dipped by myself, crawled back into ya' house\nThrough the window and crouched\nI fucking took a shit on the grout\nYou were scared of what would happen if you tried kicking me out\n(So you let him sleep it off), and I pissed on your couch\n(He wanna swim with adults and his aqua mates\nWhen that spaghetti house), mash his plate\n(Get your meatball fried no pan or baked, you his lanky slave\nThat's the last straw no pistachio taste\nHe just stand there while his master shake)\nThis man's a snake, (he slither in the shadows\nHis loyalty ain't shit since the story's been unraveled)\nSince the scandal went international, his rep has been in shambles\n(You think his interview on BBC was really [?] for British battles?\nYou musta switched the channel before he snitched and tattled\nNo one gives a damn that you were getting hassled by Jimmy Savile)\nYou're not even his type potato face, (he just pity-banged you)\nLet's move to the subtext of your musical subjects\n(Mutants and bloodshed?) Users and drug dens\n(Ghouls and the undead?) That's cool but what's up Fred?\n(You used to love puppy dogs), and beautiful sunsets\nHis group's Unusual Suspects, it's you and some fuckhead\n(How is it?) I don't know I never checked it, I just assumed it was dubstep\n[Verse 2: Eurgh & (Cruger)]\nEarly in the round, you said some wack multi about landing a heavy\nThat's a nickname for you at a swimming pool when you splash on your belly\nAnd how you gonna here to England, rapping about BBC?\nForget about it, BBC, yeah, Bender's Brown Chick\n(And it's true, last time in London you came to my drum for a short stay\nBender came straight from the pub in a sore state\nThis fuck couldn't walk straight he was drunk in my hallway\nPassed out like a Snorlax stuck in my doorframe\nNow you're a painter, and they're often alcoholic so it's no wonder he draws great\nBut being an embarrassing drunk is just one of his poor traits)\nHalfway through your last round, your face suddenly froze\nSo yeah you're a painter, you look like you've had brushes, with strokes\nAn artist? Please chill, they ain't selling for three mill'\nYour paintings look like that one that got fucked up in the Mr. Bean film\n(You think you're known but no one knows ya'\nYou look like a member of La Coka Nostra if they were broke and from Nova Scotia\nLoe's a choker, think he's gonna be dope but one choke and the show is over\nYou see Loe go red like Vodafone and Coca-Cola)\nI ain't seen Kumar choke that bad, since he hung with Harold and smoked\nA round is wasted 'cause of the impact it has on your flow\nAround his waist is where my, arms go like the manual shows\nBut this ain't first aid so there's no pats on the back if you choke\n('Cause there's been so many battles you forget all your lines in\nPeople think of you whenever there's silence\nForget battles you'd be better at miming\n'Cause we see you freeze on camera like the end of The Shining)\nAnd now he's behaving like a diva, choking every event\nDisrespecting those that came to it to see ya'\nHe forgets everything like he got wasted on tequila\nAnd now you lot are paying, for amnesia, like you're raving, in Ibiza\n(You pulled out an umbrella against Syco, what a nasty prick\nIt's bad luck to open up umbrellas indoors: that's probably why you choked in every battle after it\nYou put the 'um' in 'umbrella', and it's only proof\nThat what goes around comes around, and you know that's true\n'Cause Daylyt put an umbrella in your face, that was overdue\nIt's funny you were tryna be the Penguin, and now the joke's on you\nAnd you're so Asian-) Woah woah woah woah woah, that ain't something we're supposed to diss\n(Nah nah nah, you're so Asian-) Bruv why you acting like a total prick?\n(You're so Asian-) Bruv how many fucking times have I told you this?\nI can finally do Asian jokes, and I'm gonna fucking make the most of it\nEvery time I order a Indian dish\nIt would be nice to know what the meal was when you deliver the shit\nThese lazy fucks just initial the lids\nI wanna know which tin is which, not what your fucking signature is\nI could go to Canada, go anywhere when I land\nAnd not get shook, like John Terry's hand\nBut England's got you sweating fam\nForehead looking mega damp\nI can see oil over the red dot like I'm cooking with a Tefal pan\n(It's Bender, and Bengali)\nNo no no, is it Pesci, or Peshwari?\n(Bender likes to drink to forget his past\nBut you forget if you drink to forget you drink or drink to forget you forget your bars\nThis guy likes his liquor\nRum, whisky, white wine and spritzer\nAnd that's probably why you like Pesci, 'cause he's pint-sized and bitter)\nWhen we went to LA, he was hammered and out his skull\nActing a clown, drunk, staggering 'round alone\nIt was embarrassing how you were slamming 'em down your throat\nWe went to see Dizaster, with Canibus, but you had one with alcohol\nNow Pesci's Indian side, probably wants to spit in my Subway\nPesci's Malaysian side, wants to charge me for tap water at a buffet\nBender's a drunk state, I bet he isn't even sober now\nPesci you're a snake charmer, why can't you make him put the Cobras down?\n\n[Verse 3: Bender & (Loe Pesci)]\n(Yeah when I deliver the food to your decent apartment\nThey'll be Daylyt's ball sweat in the tikka masala\nNow since you wanna bring up Asian jokes, our people, 'bout to treat your people\nLike their people, treated our people)\nAnd our people, 'bout to treat your people\nLike Benny Blanco, treated *both* Carlito\nYou had sleepovers all month, taking breaks between the sex to write\n(We wrote this shit on the plane), you booked us on separate flights\n(Now we came here to Leeds to diss you)\nThe moment your league's official\n(Me and General Bendinochet stage a coup on the league officials)\nYou naturally tryna be Organik, (reaping all the seeds he's sown\nSo what your league has grown with green?) Just shows exactly what your GM owes\n(I remember like it was yesterday, PVP was at a jamboree in Rome\nAvi was watching battles on his phone\nOrganik was sitting on his canopy at home\nConference call, 'Calamity, your brand is being cloned'\nNow me and Diesel grill you back and forth like Hannity and Colmes)\nAnd battling needs you shitheads like Matter needs a comb\nYou openly brush off your up-and-comers and shit\n(Way to run a league, you) *both* lovable son of a bitch\n(You'd swear Eric B. and Rakim were up next with all the names you pull\nBut it won't happen, 'cause in Don't Flop nobody ever gets paid in full\nNow you think because your league is successful now we need to respect you?)\nYou think you'd pull a crowd like this for Tony D versus Tenchoo\nIt's us international battlers that you need to attend to\nWithout us, (they wouldn't give your ass the keys to the venue\nWe been doing this since the pharaohs), you goofy kids are in peril\n(You tune your visions too narrow), you two go fishing with arrows\n(Got [?] fishing apparel), we shooting fish in a barrel\n(Nah we too efficient for that), stick a tuna fish up the barrel\n(Act like a big ol' fish, flap around and squirt when you pointing\nWith enough lead to get Freddie mercury poisoned\nLadies and gents, it's the Duke of Cornball), and his royally messed up features\n(At a live battle looking like a dried apple), you're one of God's special creatures\n(Now I'm the coach that made Glen Davis cry, this training ain't the good life son\nYou act like a big baby when you lose, you just look like one)\nThey say the good die young, so you can die next\nWe catch more bodies than Apple factory suicide nets\n(And the net taught me your mom is a fat lesbian hog\nWhen I typed his last name into Ancestry.com\nAnd Rowan, we bros, but truth is your girl's a lying bitch\nFuck a line that's sick, I fucked my brother's wife that makes me Ryan Giggs, I am him\nAnd that dried-up clit? She lives by Shaftesbury\nAnd while I'm here dog, that's, where my shaft's buried\nShe's kinda fat, and her ass hairy\nShe even offered to lick Bender's ass), and my shaft berries\n(Me and Diesel, we came to Leeds for a very fickle purpose)\nTo light your brand up, (like Piccadilly Circus)\nWe the best, (we even ghostwrite for all our favorites\nYou know our status, salute us like Stephen Hawking, when) *both* he roll by Cambridge\n(You Don't Flop's Jay, so this blueprint is your whole masterpiece\nI mean your destiny was to make this child your ho, naturally\nBut ask 'em where they living,) Brighton? (They said 'Hove actually')\nYour two-on-two with Shazaam and Nils had all the thrills of a business meeting\nThat shit was so fucking boring even Nils pulled out a pillow sleeping\nYou went for unlimited rounds, and ran out of film that weekend\nIf you did a promo overtime you would *both* both be still in Sweden\nYou a shady businessman, so I think that lying's your custom\nToo bad The Saurus, you're a bitch when it comes to lying to customs\n\n[Verse 3: Eurgh & (Cruger)]\nThird round, you know my third is tight\nBender, you're pretty fat, a pretty burly guy\nTalk about Ryan Giggs, you can't look at a picture of him 'cause his hair reminds you of curly fries\nIf someone told you Canada's sick, I think they're pulling ya' leg\nI cannot stand the fucking way them hipsters look in Quebec\nMatthew Perry ain't shit when he isn't stood with the rest\nThat faggot from Glee got found with syringes put in his flesh\nRyan Gosling's got an extra like, 50 foot on his head\nJustin Bieber nearly got banged out swinging hooks at the press\nMaple syrup's wack, ice hockey's for little pussies that flex\nAnd Tim Horton's ain't got shit on Millie's Cookies or Greggs\n(You always bring albums that you're looking to sell, but you ain't pushing 'em well\nYou're just like your box of unsold CDs, full of yourself\nI'm breaking you down, these two get laid in the ground\nIt's like the BET cypher, I'm taking Canadians out\nHe's 75 and dresses just like a K Koke fan\nThis jackass is like Bad Grandpa, a fake old man\nYou're like the reason nobody sees Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone 3\nIt's becoming obvious you've become too old for the scene)\nHe's been obsessed with multis, since a young age\nHe bought a V for Vendetta 'cause 'Freedom Forever's on the front case\nPizza Express serve chocolate fudge cake and Banoffee sundae\nIf you don't believe me, now it's time I'll take you there on my lunch break\nImagine the staff's faces, as he walks up in the restaurant\nThey already start preparing the, 20 pieces they guess he wants\nHe asks for the desert menu, they all wonder what he's settled on\nHe finds the two rhyming words, takes a picture, and then he's gone\n(And you coulda named yourself after Futurama characters better\nWhy act like you're Bender, you're older than the Professor\nYou gotta be kidding me, is it 'cause you constantly drink all week\nYou bend shit to make it fit and have robotic delivery)\nIf his head's in the oven, it ain't a matter of death\nHe's tryna cook the sausage packet on the back of his neck\nI'll make this ex-champion sweat, you look like you sit around texting your ex rocking Champion sweats\n(So don't act like owning the chain should get credit\nYou were once King of the Dot champ, but so was Arcane and Sketch Menace\nBeing the best of a bad bunch is why you're the person that got it\nThat's like winning Bad Brother, the year that Anton Murphy was on it)\nBut you taught him, how to battle, is that what you're telling us?\nWell then you're a shit coach, that stinks of piss, like the Megabus\nThat whole student vers' teacher shit\nWe had people click four million times on it\nYours won't even break into 120 like the last note in a stingy guy's wallet\n(Their league used to have a couple good battles years back\nBut now saying they're tryna copy Smack's a clear fact\nThey're all doing gun bars, I don't wanna have to hear that\nToo many white rappers talking 'bout slugs makes the atmosphere wack\nAs you can guess, I'm not subscribed\nOnly Canadian thing I watch online is ice hockey fights\nThey use big empty venues, where no one's gone inside\nTheir events got the swag of a hallway in Columbine)\nAnd when people do come, they're shouting, off their face\nAm I watching a rap battle, or the fucking trading floor at a stock exchange?\nWait, a bunch of drunk rowdy people, that do not behave\nYou fit better in the King of the Dot crowd than on the stage\n(And it's a meagre existence when your battles have more hosts than good bars featuring in 'em\nAnd don't act like without Drake your events wouldn't be any different\nYou sell 1300 when Drake's there, and 13 when he isn't)\nAyo Charron, they ain't giving you that title shot that you need to be given\nBut you know that ain't the way that I'd let you be treated in England\nWe're starting a international title, and from the people we're picking\nPutting you in the first match was a easy decision\nI'ma be real, Organik gets me flustered\nGives them all job titles like they ain't just pairs of hands and extra numbers\nCalls himself a president, that pretentious fucker\nI'd rather refer to myself as a battle-setter-upper\nBut I ain't dissing Organik to make my punchlines hit\nAnd if he wants, he can tell me how to run my shit\nBut until he fires the guy that pulled that subscribe shit\nI got three words for King of the Dot, suck my dickEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/588879",

"lyrics": "The Way That You Love Lyrics[Chorus:]\nIt's just the way that you love me\n(You know you drive me crazy)\nIt's just the way that you love\n(You know you drive me crazy)\n\nI've been waiting for this moment secretly\nCounting every minute\nEvery hour till you're with me\n'Cause I know just what's in store\nAnd now I'm in your arms, baby close the door\n[Verse 1:]\nWhy waste another minute\nOoh, let's get right to it\nBaby turn the lights down\nAnd we don't have to say a word\n\nUnspoken pleasure\nThere's no way to measure\nHow you make me feel\nWhen you're near me and whisper softly\nSo don't stop\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\n\n[Verse 2:]\nAnd it seems time flies\nWhenever I'm in your arms\nI like to savor every second\nYou thrill me with your charm\n\nNow I'm lost in the passion\n(Moment, feelings, magic) we share\nAnd when I look into your eyes\nI know how much you care\n\nDon't wanna rush the feeling\n'Cause loving you's so real and\nI like the way you set the mood\nWith a little wine and candlelight\nYou might also likeIt's more than emotion\nLet's keep this fire going\nNow we're lost inside our love\n(Now we're drifting into love)\nSweet surrender is so tender\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\n\n[Bridge:]\nOoh, you know me oh so well\nYou always take your time\nAnd you always get it right\n(You know just what I like)\n\nOoh, you set my soul on fire\nAnd I know you've got my rhythm\nCause then you take me higher\n\n[Repeat Chorus x3:]\n\nDon't you stop, stop the love\nYou know you've got the rhythm\nDon't you stop, stop the love\nYou know you've got the rhythmEmbed"}]
