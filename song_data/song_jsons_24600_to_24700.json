work at the gym downtown\nWhat a shock to finally find out\nThat my nicest dress don't fit\nSo I sit down at my mirror and I get out my makeup kit\n[Chorus:]\nThe other woman\nIs in for the fight of

lover at night\nOh, and not just a wife\nYou bet your life\nI'm gonna keep him\n\n[Verse 2:]\nWell, I read the daily papers\nAnd we discuss the latest news\nAnd I love him each and every night\nJust

City Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThe boy is born in hard-time mississippi\nSurrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty\nHis parents give him love and affection\nTo keep him strong moving in the right direction\n\n[Chorus]\nLiving just enough, just enough for the city...Ee ha!\n\n[Verse 2]\nHis father works some days for fourteen hours\nAnd you can bet he barely makes a dollar\nHis mother goes to scrub the floors for many\nAnd you better believe she hardly gets a penny\n[Chorus]\nLiving just enough, just enough for the city...Ee ha!\n\n[Verse 3]\nHis sister's black but she is sure enough pretty\nHer skirt is short but Lord, her legs are sturdy\nTo walk to school she's got to get up early\nHer clothes are old but never are they dirty\n\n[Chorus]\nLiving just enough, just enough for the city...Ee ha!\n\n[Verse 4]\nHer brother's smart he's got more sense than many\nHis patience's long but soon he won't have any\nTo find a job is like a haystack needle\nCause where he lives they don't use colored people\n\n[Chorus]\nLiving just enough, just enough for the city...Ee ha!\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm living just enough\nFor the city... Ooh, ooh [x14]\n\n[Verse 5]\nHis hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty\nHe spends his life walking the streets of new york city\nHe's almost dead from breathing in air pollution\nHe tried to vote but to him there's no solution\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nLiving just enough, just enough for the city...Ee ha!\n\n[Verse 6]\nI hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow\nAnd that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow\nThis place is cruel no where could be much colder\nIf we don't change the world will soon be over\nLiving just enough, stop giving just enough for the city!!!!\n\n[Outro]\nI'm living just enough\nFor the city...

wind moans sadly.  From somewhere within the wind\ncomes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters\nsinging \"My Favorite Things.\" A series of sepia images of\nanti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after\nanother on the screen.\n\nIn the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title\nFEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:\nTITLE: \"He who makes a beast of himself Gets rid of the pain\nOf being a man.\"\nDr. Johnson\n\nThe VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe were somewhere around Barstow on\nthe edge of the desert when the\ndrugs began to take hold.\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nA red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black\nscreen.\n\nEXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nTHE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred\nmiles an hour.  THE STONES' \"Sympathy For the Devil\" blares.\n\nAT THE WHEEL\n\nSTRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,\nBEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.\nBESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND\nWRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY\nUNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.\n\nThe music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths\nup a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember saying something like:\n\"I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe\nyou should drive...\"\n\nGONZO starts shaving.\n\n2.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSuddenly there was a terrible roar\nall around us and the sky was full\nof what looked like huge bats, all\nswooping and screeching and diving\naround the car...\n\nClose on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The\nreflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close\nto one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\n... and a voice was screaming: Holy\nJesus!  What are these goddamn\nanimals?\n\nCUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -\n\nDUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere.\nGONZO casually looks over...\n\nGONZO\nWhat are you yelling about?\n\nDUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench\nmakes GONZO nick his face with his razor.\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  It's your turn to drive.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNo point mentioning these bats.  I\nthought.  The poor bastard will see\nthem soon enough.\n\nDUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,\nfrantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A\nMOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles\nthrough the impressive stash.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had two bags of grass, seventy-\nfive pellets of mescaline, five\nsheets of high powered blotter\nacid, a salt shaker half full of\ncocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-\ncolored uppers, downers, screamers,\nlaughers... Also a quart of tequila,\na quart of rum, a case of beer, a\npint of raw ether and two dozen\namyls.\n\n3.\n\n\nDUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the\nSHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with\nanother six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives\nback into the car.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNot that we needed all that for the\ntrip, but once you get locked into\na serious drug collection, the\ntendency is to push it as far as\nyou can.\n\nTHE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,\nweakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A\nBAT?\n\nEXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nIN THE RED SHARK\n\nGONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a\nlousy driver.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe only thing that really worried\nme was the ether.  There is nothing\nin the world more helpless and\nirresponsible and depraved than a\nman in the depths of an ether binge.\nAnd I knew we'd get into that\nrotten stuff pretty soon.\n\nThe radio news wars with \"SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL\" on a tape\nrecorder.\n\nRADIO NEWS\nAn overdose of heroin was listed as\nthe official cause of death for\npretty 19 year old Diane Hanby\nwhose body was found stuffed in a\nrefrigerator last week...\n\nGONZO changes the station - \"ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET\nJESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE\" vies with \"SYMPATHY\"... He\nsings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.\nThe RED SHARK fishtails.\n\nGONZO\n\"One toke over the line, sweet\nJesus.\"\n\n4.\n\n\nDUKE\n(muttering to himself)\nOne toke.  You poor fool.  Wait\ntill you see those goddamn bats.\n\nUP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD\n\nA LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a\nthumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down\nthe road...\n\nGONZO\nLet's give that boy a lift.\n\nGONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side\nof the road.\n\nDUKE\nWe can't stop here - this is bat\ncountry!\n\nGONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The\nHITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.\n\nHITCHHIKER\nHot damn!  I never rode in a\nconvertible before!\n\nThen the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the\nsight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-\nNORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.\n\nDUKE\nIs that right?  Well, I guess\nyou're about ready, eh?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER hesitates.\n\nGONZO\nWe're your friends.  We're not like\nthe others.\n\nDUKE\n(hissing sharply)\nNo more of that talk or I'll put\nthe leeches on you.\n\nDUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.\n\nEXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nThe HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED\nSHARK screams down the road.\n\n5.\n\n\nGONZO sings along to the tape player.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out\nand taking his chances.\n\nDUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear\nview mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHow long could we maintain, I\nwondered.  How long before one of\nus starts raving and jabbering at\nthis boy?  What will he think then?\nThis same lonely desert was the\nlast known home of the Manson family.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling\ndown GONZO's neck.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWould he make that grim connection\nwhen my attorney starts screaming\nabout bats and huge manta rays\ncoming down on the car?\n\nDUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with\nthe words, sometimes not.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIf so - well, we'll just have to\ncut his head off and bury him\nsomewhere.  Because it goes without\nsaying that we can't turn him loose.\nHe'd report us at once to some kind\nof outback Nazi law enforcement\nagency, and they'll run us down\nlike dogs...\n\nDUKE\n(out loud to himself)\nJesus!  Did I say that?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOr just think it?  Was I talking?\nDid they hear me?\n\nGONZO\n(reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)\nIt's okay.  He's admiring the shape\nof your skull.\n\nDUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER\ngiggles nervously.\n\n6.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMaybe I better have a chat with\nthis boy I thought.  Perhaps if I\nexplain things, he'll rest easy...\n\nDUKE\n(roaring over the\nroad noise)\nTHERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD\nPROBABLY UNDERSTAND --\n\nThe HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.\n\nDUKE\n(yells)\nCAN YOU HEAR ME?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs\ninto the back seat.\n\nDUKE\nThat's good.  Because I want you to\nhave all the background.  This is a\nvery ominous assignment -- with\novertones of extreme personal\ndanger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!\nThis is important, goddamnit!  This\nis a true story!...\n(WHACKS the BACK OF\nTHE DRIVER'S SEAT\nwith his fist)\n\n\nThe CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.\n\nGONZO\n(screams)\nKeep your hands off my fucking neck!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS\nHIM BACK DOWN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur vibrations were getting nasty --\nbut why?  Was there no communication\nin this car?  Had we deteriorated\nto the level of dumb beasts?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.\n\n7.\n\n\nDUKE\n(to HITCHHIKER)\nI want you to understand that this\nman at the wheel is my attorney!\nHe's not just some dingbat I found\non the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I\nthink he's probably Samoan.  But it\ndoesn't matter, does it?  Are you\nprejudiced?\n\nHITCHHIKER\nHell, no!\n\nDUKE\nI didn't think so.  Because in\nspite of his race, this man is\nextremely valuable to me.  Hell, I\nforgot all about this beer.  You\nwant one?\n(HITCHHIKER shakes\nhis head)\nHow about some ether?\n\nHITCHHIKER\nWhat?\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  Let's get right to the\nheart of this thing.  Twenty-four\nhours ago we were sitting in the\nPogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills\nHotel...\n\nINT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY\n\nA uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE\nthrough the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They\nare the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL\nBOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore\nSlings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED\nVERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\n... in the patio section, of\ncourse, drinking Singapore Slings\nwith mescal on the side, hiding\nfrom the brutish realities of this\nfoul year of Our Lord, 1971.\n\nThe DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and\nshades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank\ntop undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious\nconversation.\n\n8.\n\n\nDUKE\nI'm telling you, the Salazar story\nis getting too complicated.  The\nweasels have started closing in.\n\nThe DWARF sneers.\n\nDWARF\nPerhaps this is the call you've\nbeen waiting for all this time,\nsir...\n\nDUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...\n\nDUKE\nUh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...\n\nDUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A\nMOVIE SPY.\n\nDWARF\nThat was headquarters.  They want\nme to go to Las Vegas at once and\nmake contact with a Portuguese\nphotographer named Lacerda.  He'll\nhave the details.  All I have to do\nis check into my sound proof suite\nand he'll seek me out.\n\nGONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!\n\nGONZO\nGod hell!  I think I see the\npattern!  This one sounds like real\ntrouble!  You're going to need\nplenty of legal advice before this\nthing is over.  As your attorney I\nmust advise you that you'll need a\nvery fast car with no top and after\nthat, the cocaine.  And then the\ntape recorder, for special music,\nand some Acapulco shirts...\n(GONZO tucks his\nkhaki undershirt into\nhis white\nbellbottoms -- he\nmeans business!)\nThis blows my weekend, because\nnaturally I'll have to go with\nyou -- and we'll have to arm\nourselves.\n\n9.\n\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  If a thing's worth doing,\nit's worth doing right.\n\nDUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them\nwith the (very large) check in his hand.\n\nThey sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it\nswinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.\n\nDUKE\nI tell you, my man.  This is the\nAmerican Dream in action!  We'd be\nfools not to ride this strange\ntorpedo all the way to the end.\n\nGONZO\nIndeed.  We must do it.  What kind\nof story is this?\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY\n\nDUKE and GONZO emerge.\n\nDUKE\nThe Mint 400!  The richest off-road\nrace for motorcycles and dune-\nbuggies in the history of organized\nsport!\n(handing parking\nticket to Valet)\n-- a fantastic spectacle in honor\nof some fatback grossero who owns\nthe luxurious Mint Hotel in the\nheart of downtown Vegas... at least\nthat's what the press release says.\n\nTheir car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They\njump in.\n\nDUKE\nWe're going to have to drum it up\non our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.\n\nAnd they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-\nbleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY\n\nThe PINTO races through shot.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nGetting hold of the drugs and\nshirts had been no problem...\n\n10.\n\n\nEXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\n\nThe PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back\nwindow full of Hawaiian shirts.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\n... but the car and tape recorder\nwere not easy things to round up at\n6:30 on a Friday afternoon in\nHollywood.\n\nINT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\n\nTORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile\nas GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four\nSingapore Slings.\n\nGONZO\nO.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it.\nWe'll be there in thirty minutes.\n(to DUKE -- hand over\nthe PHONE)\nI finally located a car with\nadequate horsepower and the proper\ncoloring.\n(into PHONE)\nWhat?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has\na major credit card!  Do you\nrealize who the fuck you're talking\nto?\n\nDUKE\nDon't take any guff from these\nswine.\n(GONZO slams the\nphone down)\nNow we need a sound store with the\nfinest equipment.  Nothing dinky.\nOne of those new Belgian Heliowatts\nwith a voice-activated shotgun\nmike, for picking up conversations\nin oncoming cars.\n\nGONZO\nWe won't make the nut unless we\nhave unlimited credit.\n\nDUKE\nWe will.  You Samoans are all the\nsame.  You have no faith in the\nessential decency of the white\nman's culture.\n\n11.\n\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK\n\nThe PINTO races down street.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe store was closed, but the\nsalesman said he would wait, if we\nhurried...\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK\n\nThey're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE\nBANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut we were delayed en route when a\nStingray in front of us killed a\npedestrain.\n\nDirectly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered\ncorpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.\n\nEXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had trouble, again, at the car\nrental agency.\n\nBehind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with\nsatisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out\na clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.\n\nAGENT\nSay... uh... you fellas are going\nto be careful with this car, aren't\nyou?\n\nDUKE\nOf course.\n\nDUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the\ngas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.\n\nAGENT\nWell, good god!  You just backed\nover that two foot concrete abutment\nand you didn't even slow down!\nForty-five in reverse!  And you\nbarely missed the pump!\n\nDUKE\nNo harm done.  I always test the\ntransmission that way.  The rear\nend.  For stress factors.\n\n12.\n\n\nGONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box\nof rum and ice into the RED SHARK.\n\nAGENT\nSay.  Are you fellows drinking?\n\nDUKE\nNot me.  We're responsible people.\n\nHe JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The\nAGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.\n\nGONZO\nThere's another worrier.  He's\nprobably all cranked up on speed.\n\nEXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nSTRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted\nfigures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe spent the rest of that night\nrounding up materials and packing\nthe car.  Then we ate some mescaline\nand went swimming.\n\nThe surf crashes in the distance...\n\nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT\n\nDUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself\nfloat up through the silvery bubbles...\n\nDUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING\nMOONLIT SURF.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur trip was different.  It was to\nbe a classic affirmation of\neverything right and true in the\nnational character; a gross,\nphysical salute to the fantastic\npossibilities of life in this\ncountry.  But only for those with\ntrue grit...\n\nEXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nDUKE's intense face.\n\nDUKE\n...and we're chock full of that!\n\n13.\n\n\nGONZO\nDamn right!\n\nDUKE\nMy attorney understands this\nconcept, despite his racial handicap.\nBut do you?!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHe said he understood, but I could\nsee in his eyes that he didn't.  He\nwas lying to me.\n\nGONZO\nMy heart!\n\nGONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and\nscreeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\nWhere's the medicine?\n\nDUKE\nThe medicine?  Yes, it's right here.\n\nDUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.\n\nDUKE\nDon't worry, this man has a bad\nheart... Angina Pectoris.  But we\nhave a cure for it.\n\nDUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO\nfalls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The\nHITCHHIKER looks petrified.\n\nGONZO\n(suddenly flailing\nhis naked arms at the sky)\nTurn up the fucking music!  My\nheart feels like an alligator!\nVolume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must\nhave bass!  What's wrong with us?\nAre you goddamn old ladies?\n\nDUKE\n(turns up music to\nfull volume)\nYou scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch\nyour language!  You're talking to a\nDoctor of Journalism!\n\n14.\n\n\nGONZO\n(laughing uncontrollably)\nWhat the fuck are we doing out here?\nSomebody call the police!  We need\nhelp!\n\nDUKE\n(to HITCHHIKER)\nPay no attention to this swine.  He\ncan't handle the medicine.\n(he begins laughing)\n\n\nGONZO\n(to the HITCHHIKER)\nThe truth is we're going to Vegas\nto croak a scag baron named Savage\nHenry.  I've known him for years\nbut he ripped us off -- and you\nknow what that means, right?\n\nGONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\nSavage Henry has cashed his check!\nWe're going to rip his lungs out!\n\nDUKE\nAnd eat them!  That bastard won't\nget away with this!  What's going\non in this country when a scum\nsucker like that can get away with\nsandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?\n\nGONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID,\nAND FLEES.\n\nHITCHHIKER\nThanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot.\nI like you guys.  Don't worry about\nme.\n\nDUKE\n(yells)\nWait a minute!  Come back and have\na beer!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.\n\n15.\n\n\nGONZO\nGood riddance.  That boy made me\nnervous.  Did you see his eyes?\n(laughing)\nJesus, this is good medicine.\n\nDUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.\n\nDUKE\n(suddenly clambering\ninto the front seat)\nMove over!!  We have to get out of\nCalifornia before that kid finds a\ncop!\n\nDUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...\n\nEXT. UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nTHE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead\ndriving.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt was absolutely imperative that\nwe get to the Mint Hotel before the\ndeadline for press registration.\nOtherwise, we might have to pay for\nour suite.\n\nGONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off\nand the powder swirls away on the wind.\n\nGONZO\nOh, Jesus!  Did you see what god\njust did to us?\n\nDUKE\nGod didn't do that!  You did it!\nYou're a fucking narcotics agent,\nthat was our cocaine, you pig!\n\nGONZO\n(waving his .357\nMagnum at Duke)\nYou better be careful.  Plenty of\nvultures out here.  They'll pick\nyour bones clean before morning.\n\nDUKE\nYou whore!\n\nGONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.\n\n16.\n\n\nGONZO\nHere -- chew this.  It's your half\nof the acid.\n\nDUKE takes his half -- chews it.\n\nDUKE\nHow long do I have?\n\nGONZO\nMaybe thirty more minutes.  As your\nattorney, I advise you to drive at\ntop speed.  It'll be a goddamn\nmiracle if we can get there before\nyou turn into a wild animal.  Are\nyou ready for that?  Checking into\na Vegas hotel under a phony name\nwith intent to commit capital fraud\nand a head full of acid.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThirty minutes.  It was going to be\nvery close.\n\nThe RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard:\n\"DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \\ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20\nYEARS; SALE - LIFE!!\"\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK\n\nThe RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT.  A great banner\nspanning the street announces the MINT 400.\n\nDUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a\nbuckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the\nTICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.\n\nDUKE\nI need this, right?\n\nATTENDANT\nI'll remember your face.\n\nDUKE stares -- losing it...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere is no way of explaining the\nterror I felt.\n\nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\nDUKE waits in line at the front desk -- RIGID WITH PENT UP\nENERGY.  GONZO's ahead of him -- muscling in -- trying to\nqueue jump and failing.\n\n17.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI was pouring sweat.  My blood is\ntoo thick for Nevada.  I've never\nbeen able to properly explain\nmyself in this climate.\n\nA COUPLE move off and DUKE jerks forward -- stops -- eyes\nfixed on the stony FEMALE RESERVATIONS CLERK.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\nBe quiet, be calm... name, rank,\nand press affiliation, nothing\nelse...\n\nDUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the\ntension almost snapping him in two.  GONZO's FLAPPING\nAROUND -- absolutely no success.\n\nSomething catches DUKE's eye... He REMAINS ROOTED -- his\neyes turning to the VEGETAL PAISLEY PATTERNS ON THE CARPET\nWHICH ARE SHIFTING -- UNDULATING.  THE CARPET PATTERNS ARE\nINEXORABLY CREEPING UP THE WALLS...\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\n...ignore this terrible drug,\npretend it's not happening...\n\nThe LAST PEOPLE leave -- with A FINAL, STIFF MOVE, DUKE\ncomes face to face with the RESERVATIONS CLERK... AND\nEXPLODES!\n\nDUKE\nHI THERE.  MY NAME... AH, RAOUL\nDUKE... ON... ON THAT LIST, THAT'S\nFOR SURE.  FREE LUNCH, FINAL\nWISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE...

I'll lend you some money.\nLet's go outside and see how much\nwe have left.\n\nGONZO\nCan we make it?\n\nDUKE\nThat depends on how many people we\nfuck with between here and the door.\n\nGONZO\nI want to leave fast.\n\nDUKE\nOK.  Lets pay this bill and get up\nvery slowly.  It's going to be a\nlong walk.\n(signals waitress who\ncomes over)\n\n\nGONZO\n(suddenly to waitress)\nDo they pay you to screw that bear?\n\nWAITRESS\nWhat?\n\nDUKE\nHe's just kidding.\n(to GONZO)\nCome on, Doc -- lets go downstairs\nand gamble.\n\nGONZO trembles with fear -- walks to the edge of the\nturntable.\n\nGONZO\nWhen does this thing stop?\n\n38.\n\n\nDUKE\nIt won't stop.  It's not ever going\nto stop.\n\nDUKE carefully steps off the turntable.\n\nGONZO, eyes staring blindly ahead, squiting in fear and\nconfusion, rooted to the spot, is carried away.\n\nDUKE\nDon't move you'll come around.\n\nDUKE reaches out to grab GONZO, who jumps back -- keeps\ngoing around.\n\nThe BARTENDER narrows his eyes at them.\n\nDUKE steps onto the merry-go-round -- hurries round the\nbar -- approaching GONZO from the blind side and shoves\nGONZO from behind.  GONZO goes down with a hellish scream.\nDUKE approaches him with his hands in the air.  Smiling.\n\nDUKE\nYou fell.  Let's go.\n\nGONZO refuses to move and stands tense, fists clenched,\nlooking for somebody to hit...an old woman perhaps?\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nOK.  You stay here and go to jail.\nI'm leaving.\n\nDUKE walks fast towards the stairs.  GONZO catches up with\nhim.\n\nGONZO\nDid you see that?  Some sonofabitch\nkicked me in the back.\n\nDUKE\nProbably the bartender.  He wanted\nto stomp you for what you said to\nthe waitress.\n\nGONZO\nGood God!  Let's get out of here!\nWhere's the elevator?\n\nDUKE\n(turning him in the\nopposite direction)\nDon't go near that elevator.\nThat's just what they want us to\ndo... trap us in a steel box and\ntake us down to the basement.\n\n39.\n\n\nEXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT\n\nDUKE and GONZO stumble out of the entrance.\n\nDUKE\nDon't run.  They'd like any excuse\nto shoot us.\n\nGONZO\n(in an extended fall)\nYou drive!

DUKE TAKING\nCARE NOT TO STEP ON THE PATTERNED PART OF THE CARPET.\n\nGONZO STRUGGLES with the key in the lock.\n\nGONZO\nThose bastards have changed the\nlock on us.  They probably searched\nthe room.  Jesus, we're finished!\n\nThe door SUDDENLY SWINGS OPEN.  DUKE AND GONZO fall inside.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nGONZO\nBolt everything!  Use all chains!\n\nDUKE locks the door.  The suite is crowded with ROOM SERVICE\nGOODIES.  DUKE turns to see GONZO staring at two hotel room\nkeys.  EVERYTHING STOPS.\n\nGONZO\nWhere did this one come from?\n\nDUKE snatches a key.\n\nDUKE\nThat's Lacerda's room.\n\nGONZO smiles a slow smile...\n\nGONZO\nYeah... I thought we might need it...\n\nDUKE\nWhat for?\n\nGONZO snatches the key back.\n\n40.\n\n\nGONZO\nLet's go up there and blast him out\nof bed with the fire hose.\n\nDUKE\nNo, we should leave the poor\nbastard alone.  I get the feeling\nthat he's avoiding us for some\nreason.\n\nGONZO\nDon't kid yourself.  That Portuguese\nson of a bitch is dangerous.  He's\nwatching us like a hawk.\n\nDUKE\nHe told me he was turning in early...\n\nGONZO utters an anguished cry -- slaps the wall with both\nhands.\n\nGONZO\nThat dirty bastard!  I knew it!\nHe's got hold of my woman!\n\nDUKE\n(laughing)\nThat little blonde groupie with the\nfilm crew?  You think he sodomized\nher?\n\nGONZO\nThat's right, laugh about it!

DUKE blanches.\n\nDUKE\nWhere'd you get that knife?\n\nGONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- MANIACAL.\n\nGONZO\nRoom service sent it up.  I wanted\nsomething to cut the limes.\n\nGONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- INTO EIGHTHS!\n\nDUKE\nWhat limes?\n\nGONZO SLICES -- SIXTEENTHS!\n\n41.\n\n\nGONZO\nThey didn't have any.  They don't\ngrow in the desert.\n\nSLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!\n\nGONZO\nThat dirty toad bastard!  I knew I\nshould have taken him out when I\nhad the chance.  Now he has her.\n\nSLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO SLASHES INSANELY!\n\nDUKE watches -- straight-faced.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember the girl.

ELEVATOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)\n\nAn elevator door opens to reveal the SMILING FACES OF\nLACERDA, THE BLONDE TV REPORTER AND HER CREW.\n\nDUKE and GONZO stagger in.\n\nLACERDA drops his smile.  He's standing beside the BLONDE TV\nREPORTER.  A trembling GONZO moonily turns his eyes onto her.\n\nBLONDE TV REPORTER\n(to Gonzo)\nYou must be a rider.  What class\nare you in?\n\nGONZO\nClass?  What the fuck do you mean?\n\nBLONDE TV REPORTER\nWhat do you ride?  We're filming\nthe race for a TV series -- maybe\nwe can use you.\n\nGONZO\nUse me?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMother of God, I thought.  Here it\ncomes.\n\nGONZO is TREMBLING BADLY.  There's a moment of uncomfortable\nsilence.\n\n42.\n\n\nGONZO\n(suddenly shouting)\nI ride the BIG ONES!

We're\nwith the Factory Team.\n\nTV CAMERAMAN\nBullshit.\n\nGONZO stills -- becomes dangerous -- zeros in on the TV\nCAMERAMAN -- groin to groin...\n\nGONZO\nWait a minute, pardon me lady, but\nI think there's some kind of\nignorant chicken-sucker in this car\nwho needs his face cut open.  You\ncheap honky faggots!  Which one of\nyou wants to get cut?!\n\nDEAD SILENCE.\n\nDing!  The elevator door opens, but nobody moves.  The door\ncloses.\n\nNext floor.  Ding!  The door opens again.

Did\nyou put him on to her?\n\nDUKE\n(backing slowly\ntowards the door)\nLook you better put that blade away\nand get your head straight.  I have\nto put the car in the lot.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOne of the things you learn, after\nyears of dealing with drug people,\nis that you can turn your back on a\nperson, but never turn your back on\na drug.

No joy.  DUKE watches.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWho are these people?  These faces!\nWhere do they come from?  They look\nlike caricatures of used car\ndealers from Dallas.\n(MORE)\n\n44.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O; CONT'D)\nAnd, sweet Jesus, there are a hell\nof a lot of them at four-thirty on\na Monday morning.  Still humping\nthe American dream, that vision of\nthe big winner somehow emerging\nfrom the last minute predawn chaos\nof a stale Vegas casino.\n\nDUKE stops at the Money Wheel, puts down a two dollar bill\non a number, the wheel turns, he loses.\n\nDUKE\nYou bastards!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNo.  Calm down.  Learn to ENJOY\nlosing.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE walks back into the room.  We hear the LOUD STRAINS OF\nTHREE DOG NIGHT'S \"JOY TO THE WORLD.\"\n\nHe walks to the bathroom and opens the door.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nSubmerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub.\nSoap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface.  A\nlarge empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor.  The\nshower is on -- the tub overflowing.  THE TAPE RECORDER\nPLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over\nthe sink.\n\nDUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED\nUP WHITE BLOTTER.\n\nDUKE\nYou ate ALL THIS ACID?\n\nNo answer.\n\nDUKE\n(turning down the volume)\nYou evil son of a bitch.  You\nbetter hope there's some Thorazine\nin that bag, because if there's\nnot, you're in bad trouble.\n\nGONZO\nMusic!  Turn it up.  Put that tape\non.\n\n45.\n\n\nDUKE\nWhat tape?\n\nGONZO\nJefferson Airplane. \"White Rabbit.\"\nI want a rising sound.\n\nDUKE\nYou're doomed.  I'm leaving here in\ntwo hours and then they're going to\ncome up here and beat the mortal\nshit out of you with big saps.\nRight there in that tub.\n\nGONZO\nI dig my own graves.  Green water\nand the White Rabbit.  Put it on.\n\nDUKE\nOK.  But do me one last favor, will\nyou.  Can you give me two hours?\nThat's all I ask -- just two hours\nto sleep before tomorrow.  I\nsuspect it's going to be a very\ndifficult day.\n\nHe switches on the tape. \"WHITE RABBIT\" begins to build.\n\nGONZO\n(coolly)\nOf course, I'm your attorney, I'll\ngive you all the time you need, at\nmy normal rates: $45 an hour -- but\nyou'll be wanting a cushion, so,\nwhy don't you just lay one of those\n$100 bills down there beside the\nradio, and fuck off?\n\nDUKE\nHow about a check?\n\nGONZO\nWhatever's right.\n\nDUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and\nleaves, closing the door behind him.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE goes across to the sofa and crashes -- exhausted.\nSuddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom.\n\nGONZO (V/O)\nHelp!  You bastard!  I need help!\n\n46.\n\n\nDUKE JUMPS up -- crosses to the bathroom door, muttering.\n\nDUKE\nShit, he's killing himself!\n\nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nDUKE RUSHES IN.  GONZO flails -- trying to reach the radio\nwith the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its\nmounts.\n\nGONZO\n(snarling)\nI want that fucking radio!\n\nDUKE GRABS THE RADIO.\n\nDUKE\nDon't touch it!  Get back in that\ntub!\n\nGONZO\nBack the tape up.  I need it again!\nLet it roll!  Just as high as the\nfucker can go!  And when it comes\nto that fantastic note where the\nrabbit bites its own head off, I\nwant you to THROW THAT FUCKING\nRADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!\n\nDUKE stares down at GONZO.\n\nDUKE\nNot me.  It would blast you through\nthe wall -- stone dead in ten\nseconds and they'd make me explain\nit!\n\nGONZO\nBULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this.\n\nHIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE.\n\nDUKE\nJesus.\n\nGONZO\nDo it!  I want to get HIGHER!\n\nDUKE considers this.  He's had enough.\n\n47.\n\n\nDUKE\nOkay.  You're right.  This is\nprobably the only solution.\n(holds the PLUGGED IN\nTAPE/RADIO over the tub)\nLet me make sure I have it all\nlined up.  You want me to throw\nthis thing into the tub when \"WHITE\nRABBIT\" peaks.  Is that it?\n\nGONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.\n\nGONZO\nFuck yes.  I was beginning to think\nI was going to have to go out and\nget one of the goddamn maids to do\nit.\n\nDUKE\nAre you ready?\n\nHe switches \"WHITE RABBIT\" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS\nAND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.\n\nMeanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a\ngood two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when \"WHITE\nRABBIT\" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.\n\nGONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A\nTIDAL WAVE.\n\nDUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF\nTHE BATHROOM.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE slumps onto the sofa.\n\nSILENCE.\n\nGONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused.  HE\nWAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at\nDUKE.  DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.\n\nDUKE\nMACE!  YOU WANT THIS?\n\nGONZO stops -- hisses.\n\nGONZO\nYou bastard!  You'd do that,\nwouldn't you?\n\n48.\n\n\nDUKE\n(laughs)\nWhy worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing\nin the world like a Mace high.\nForty-five minutes on your knees\nwith the dry heaves...\n\nGONZO\nYou cheap honky sonofabitch...\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  Hell, just a minute ago,\nyou were asking me to kill you!\nAnd now you want to kill me!  What\nI should do, goddamnit, is call the\npolice!\n\nGONZO\nThe cops?\n\nDUKE\nThere's no choice.  I wouldn't dare\ngo to sleep with you wandering\naround with a head full of acid and\nwanting to slice me up with that\ngoddamn knife!\n\nGONZO\n(mumbles)\nWho said anything about slicing you\nup?  I just wanted to carve a\nlittle Z on your forehead.  Nothing\nserious.\n\nGONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.\n\nDUKE\n(menaces him with the MACE)\nGet back in that tub.  Eat some\nreds and try to calm down.  Smoke\nsome grass, shoot some smack --\nshit, do whatever you have to do,\nbut let me get some rest.\n\nGONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.\n\nGONZO\nHell, yes.  You really need some\nsleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn.\nWhat a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't\nlet me keep you up.\n\n49.\n\n\nGONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair\nup against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next\nto the clock.\n\nDUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He\ncollapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIgnore the nightmare in the bathroom.\nJust another ugly refugee from the\nLove Generation.\n\nThe WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his\nface.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL\nBEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney had never been able to\naccept the notion -- often espoused\nby former drug abusers -- that you\ncan get a lot higher without drugs\nthan with them.  And neither have\nI, for that matter.\n\nThe pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL\nLIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the\nforeground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior\nof A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.\n\nINT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT\n\nA slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the\naction is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI recall one night in the Matrix.\nThere I was -- a victim of the Drug\nExplosion.  A natural street freak,\njust eating whatever came by.\n\nA ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The\nsound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.\n\nROAD-PERSON\nAnybody want some L...S...D...?  I\ngot all the makin's right here.\nAll I need is a place to cook.\n\nThe camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.\n\nINT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nStill in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a\nHUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.\n\n50.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI decided to eat only half at first.\nGood thinking.  But I spilled the\nrest on the sleeve of my red\nPendleton shirt.\n\nDUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the\ndoor to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in\nslow-motion.\n\nMUSICIAN\nWhat's the trouble?\n\nDUKE\n(also in slow-motion)\nWell, all this white stuff on my\nsleeve is LSD.\n\nThe MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A\nlong pause.\n\nCut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-\ncut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.\nWe cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the\nmen's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...\nsucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The\nSTOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWith a bit of luck his life was\nruined -- forever thinking that\njust behind some narrow door in all\nhis favorite bars, men in red\nPendleton shirts are getting\nincredible kicks from things he'll\nnever know.\n\nINT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT\n\nThe STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking\nlost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a\nTV white noise snowstorm.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE sits staring at the TV.\n\n51.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nStrange memories on this nervous\nnight in Las Vegas.\n(he gets up, pours\nhimself a drink)\nHas it been five years?  Six?  It\nseems like a lifetime -- the kind\nof peak that never comes again.\nSan Francisco in the middle sixties\nwas a very special time and place\nto be a part of.  But no\nexplanation, no mix of words or\nmusic or memories can touch that\nsense of knowing that you were\nthere and alive in that corner of\ntime and the world.  Whatever it\nmeant.\n\nDUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.\n\nEXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE\n\nWe are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nTHERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION,\nAT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE\nSPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A\nFANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT\nWHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,\nTHAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I\nTHINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE\nOF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE\nFORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY\nMEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T\nNEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY\nprevail.  We had all the momentum;\nwe were riding the crest of a high\nand beautiful wave...\n\nDUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE\nNEVER SEEN BEFORE.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSo now, less than five years later,\nyou can go up on a steep hill in\nLas Vegas and look west, and with\nthe right kind of eyes you can\nalmost see the high water mark --\nthat place where the wave finally\nbroke and rolled back.\n\n52.\n\n\nThe memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.\nSuddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi\nshouting \"WOODSTOCK \u00dcBER ALLES!\"\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN\n\nA harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking\nlike shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe decision to flee came suddenly.\nOr maybe not.\n\nDUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of\nfruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.\n\nBELL BOY\nRoom service!\n\nThe BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already\nstacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMaybe I'd planned it all along --\nsubconsciously waiting for the\nright moment.  The bill was a\nfactor, I think.  Because I had no\nmoney to pay for it.\n\nDUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur room service tabs had been\nrunning somewhere between $29 and\n$36 per hour, for forty-eight\nconsecutive hours.  Incredible.\nHow could it happen?\n\nDUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED\nLUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room --\nempty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut by the time I asked this\nquestion, there was no one around\nto answer.\n\nDUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.\n\n53.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney was gone.

CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --\nleaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both\nways, then hurries away down the corridor.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt crept up my spine like first\nrising vibes of an acid frenzy.\nAll these horrible realities began\nto dawn on me.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY\n\nAn anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the\nelevator descends.  He searches his pockets...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHere I was, alone in Las Vegas,\nwith this goddamned incredibly\nexpensive car, completely twisted\non drugs, no cash, no story for the\nmagazine.  And on top of everything\nelse I had a gigantic goddamn hotel\nbill to deal with.\n\nDUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.\n\nThe door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN\nHANDCUFFS.\n\nDUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors\nclose.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI didn't even know who had won the\nrace.  Maybe nobody.\n\n54.\n\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\nDUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering\nMANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.\n\nDUKE\n(muttering to himself)\nHow would Horatio Alger have\nhandled this situation?\n\nEXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY\n\nMotoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN\nwith a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves\nat the CAR BOY.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nStay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a\nrelatively respectable citizen -- a\nmultiple felon, perhaps, but\ncertainly not dangerous.\n\nThe CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The\nback seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint\n400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\nLuckily, I had taken the soap and\ngrapefruit and other luggage out to\nthe car a few hours earlier.  Now\nit was only a matter of slipping\nthe noose...\n\nDUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!\n\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMR. DUKE!\n\nDUKE freezes.\n\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMr. Duke!  We've been looking for\nyou!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe game was up!  They had me.\n\nDUKE\n(to himself)\nWell, why not?  Many fine books\nhave been written in prison.\n\n55.\n\n\nResigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK\narrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS\nHAND.\n\nCLERK\nSir?\n(thrusts out a TELEGRAM)\nThis telegram came for you.\nActually, it isn't for you.  It's\nfor somebody named Thompson, but it\nsays 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does\nthat make sense?\n\nDUKE\n(barely able to speak)\nYes... It makes sense.\n\nDUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.\n\nThe CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous\nstash inside.\n\nCLERK\nI checked the register for this man\nThompson.  We don't show him but I\nfigured he might be part of your\nteam.\n\nDUKE\nHe is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to\nhim.\n\nHe fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.\n\nSECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word\nor two.\n\nCLERK\nWhat confused us was Dr. Gonzo's\nsignature on the telegram from Los\nAngeles.  When we knew he was right\nhere in the hotel.\n\nDUKE\nYou did the right thing.  Never try\nto understand a press message.\nAbout half the time we use codes --\nespecially with Dr. Gonzo.\n\nCLERK\nTell me.  When will the doctor be\nawake?\n\n56.\n\n\nDUKE\n(tenses)\nAwake?  What do you mean?\n\nDUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.\n\nCLERK\n(uncomfortably)\nWell... the manager, Mr. Heem,\nwould like to meet him.  Nothing\nunusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet\nall our large accounts... put them\non a personal basis... just a chat\nand a handshake, you understand.\n\nDUKE\nOf course.  But if I were you, I'd\nleave the Doctor alone until after\nhe's eaten breakfast.  He's a very\ncrude man.\n\nDUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.\n\nCLERK\nBut he will be available?  Perhaps\nlater this morning?\n\nDUKE\nLook.  That telegram was all\nscrambled.  It was actually from\nThompson, not to him.  Western\nUnion must have gotten the names\nreversed.  I have to get going.  I\nhave to get out to the track.\n\nCLERK\nThere's no hurry!  The race is over!\n\nDUKE\n(taking off)\nNot for me.\n\nHe waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.\n\nCLERK\nLet's have lunch!\n\nDUKE\nRighto!\n\nEXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY\n\nDUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.\n\n57.\n\n\nA \"YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS\" sign flashes past.\n\nBob Dylan plays: \"Memphis Blues Again -- \"Aaww, Mama, can\nthis really by the end...?\"\n\nA sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nJesus, bad waves of paranoia,\nmadness, fear and loathing --\nintolerable vibrations in this\nplace.  Get out!  The weasels were\nclosing in.  I could smell the ugly\nbrutes.  Flee!\n\nDUKE drives fast.\n\nDUKE\nDo me one last favor Lord: just\ngive me five more high-speed hours\nbefore you bring the hammer down;\njust let me get rid of this goddamn\ncar and off of this horrible desert.\n\nA sign flashes \"YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.\"\n\nA patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nYou evil bastard!  This is your\nwork!  You'd better take care of\nme, Lord... because if you don't\nyou're going to have me on your\nhands.\n\nThe patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nFew people understand the psychology\nof dealing with a Highway Traffic\nCop.  Your normal speeder will\npanic and immediately pull over to\nthe side.  This is wrong.\n\nDUKE floors the gas pedal.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt arouses contempt in the cop heart.\n\nTHE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.\n\n58.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMake the bastard chase you.  He\nwill follow.  But he won't know\nwhat to make of your blinker signal\nthat says you're about to turn right.\n\nDUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThis is to let him know you're\nlooking for a proper place to pull\noff and talk.\n\nAN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.\n\nDUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt will take him a moment to\nrealize that he is about to make\n180 degree turn at speed... but you\nwill be ready for it, braced for\nthe G's and the fast heel toe work.\n\nThe patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.\n\nEXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY\n\nThe patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE\nstands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nJust what the FUCK did you think\nyou were doing?!\n\nDUKE smiles.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nMay I see your license.\n\nDUKE\nOf course, officer.\n\nDUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer\ncan -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI knew I was fucked.\n\nThe COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for\nDUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.\n\n59.\n\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nCould I have that, please?\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  It was getting warm anyway.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --\nglances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars\nof soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou realize...\n\nDUKE\nYeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I\nunderstand that.  I knew it was a\ncrime but I did it anyway.  Shit,\nwhy argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nThat's a strange attitude.\n\nHe looks at DUKE thoughtfully.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou know -- I get the feeling you\ncould use a nap.  There's a rest\narea up ahead.  Why don't you pull\nover and sleep a few hours?\n\nDUKE\nA nap won't help.  I've been awake\nfor too long -- three or four\nnights.  I can't even remember.  If\nI go to sleep now, I'm dead for\ntwenty hours.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nOkay.  Here's how it is.  What goes\ninto my book, as of noon, is that I\napprehended you... for driving too\nfast, and advised you to proceed no\nfurther than the next rest area...\nyour stated destination, right?\nWhere you plan to take a long nap.\nDo I make myself clear?\n\nDUKE\nHow far is Baker?  I was hoping to\nstop there for lunch.\n\n60.\n\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nNot my jurisdiction.  The city\nlimits are two point two miles\nbeyond the rest area.  Can you make\nit that far?\n\nDUKE\nI'll try.  I've been wanting to go\nto Baker for a long time.  I've\nheard a lot about it.\n\nThe PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nExcellent seafood.  With a mind\nlike yours, you'll probably want to\ntry the land-crab.  Try the Majestic\nDiner.\n\nThe PATROLMAN slams the door shut.\n\nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY\n\nDUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt raped.  The Pig had done me\non all fronts, and now he was going\noff to chuckle about it -- on the\nwest side of town, waiting for me\nto make a run for L.A.\n\nDUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he\nsignals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn\nhe sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn\ntheir eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER\ndrops his thumb.\n\nDUKE\nGreat Jesus, it's him.\n\nDUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE\nWAY HE CAME.\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.\n\nDUKE\nThey've nailed me!  I'm trapped in\nsome stinking desert crossroads\ncalled Baker.  I don't have much\ntime.  The fuckers are closing in.\nThey'll hunt me down like a beast!\n\n61.\n\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.  Mexican\nDay of the Dead masks hang from the walls -- flame-red demons.\n\nGONZO\nWho?  You sound a little paranoid.\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE screams -- sweat pouring.\n\nDUKE\nYou bastard!  I need a lawyer\nimmediately!\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO\nWhat are you doing in Baker?\nDidn't you get my telegram?\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE\nWhat?  Fuck telegrams.  I'm in\ntrouble.  You worthless bastard.\nI'll cripple your ass for this!\nAll that shit in the car is yours!\nYou understand that?  When I finish\ntestifying out here you'll be\ndisbarred!\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO\nYou're supposed to be in Vegas.  We\nhave a suite at the Flamingo.  I\nwas just about to leave for the\nairport.\n\nINT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket.\n\nGONZO'S VOICE\nYou brainless scumbag!  You're\nsupposed to be covering the National\nDistrict Attorney's conference!  I\nmade all the reservations... rented\na white Cadillac convertible... the\nwhole thing is arranged!  What the\nhell are you doing out there in the\nmiddle of the fucking desert?\n\n62.\n\n\nDUKE stares at the telegram.\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  It's all a big joke.\nI'm actually sitting beside the\npool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking\nfrom a portable phone.  Some dwarf\nbrought it out from the casino.  I\nhave total credit!  Can you grasp\nthat?\n(shouts)\nDon't come anywhere near this place!\nForeigners aren't welcome here!\n\nDUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone.\n\nEXT. DESERT - DAY\n\nC/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWell.  This is how the world works.\n\nC/U An IGUANA basks in the sun.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nAll energy flows according to the\nwhims of the Great Magnet.\n\nC/U Barrel of the gun.  It fires.  An explosion of desert\ndirt.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhat a fool I was to defy Him.\n\nThe IGUANA sits unfazed.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNever cross the Great Magnet.  I\nunderstood this now...\n(another blast from\nthe gun)\n... and with understanding came a\nsense of almost terminal relief.\n\nDUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the\nthuds of the explosions echo away.\n\nEXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY\n\nThe RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.\n\n63.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI had to get rid of The Shark.  Too\nmany people might recognize it...\n...especially the Vegas Police.\n(tight C/U of DUKE)\nLuckily, my credit card was still\ntechnically valid.\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL:\n\nDUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE\nWHITE WHALE.\n\nDUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThis was a superior machine -- ten\ngrand worth of gimmicks and high\nprice special effects.  The rear\nwindows leapt up with a touch like\nfrogs in a dynamited pond.  The\ndashboard was full of esoteric\nlights and dials and meters that I\nwould never understand.\n\nEXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON\n\nA GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S\nCONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIf the Pigs were gathering in\nVegas, I felt the Drug Culture\nshould be represented as well...\nand there was a certain bent appeal\nin the notion of running a savage\nburn on one Las Vegas hotel and\nthen just wheeling across town and\nchecking into another.\n\nThe WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately\nattended by impressed MINIONS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMe and a thousand ranking cops from\nall over America.  Why not?  Move\nconfidently into their midst.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON\n\nDUKE enters -- old Levis, grubby sneakers, 10 peso Acapulco\nshirt coming apart at the seams, 3 day growth, eyes hidden\nbehind mirror shades.  He heads for the check-in line.\n\n64.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy arrival was badly timed.\n\nTHE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS.  200 of them, on vacation, all\ndressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts,\nArnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.\n\nAhead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK.\nThe POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side,\nweeping.  The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.\n\nPOLICE CHIEF\nWhat do you mean I'm too late to\nregister?  I'm a police chief.\nFrom Michigan.  Look, fella, I told\nyou.\n(waves a POSTCARD)\nI have a postcard here that says I\nhave reservations in this hotel.\n\nCLERK\n(prissily)\nI'm sorry, sir.  You're on the\n\"late list.\" Your reservations were\ntransferred to the... ah...\nMoonlight Motel, which is out on\nParadise Boulevard...\n\nPOLICE CHIEF\nI've already paid for my goddamn\nroom!\n\nCLERK\nIt's actually a very fine place of\nlodging and only sixteen blocks\nfrom here, with its own pool and...\n\nPOLICE CHIEF\nYou dirty little faggot!  Call the\nmanager!  I'm tired of listening to\nthis dogshit!\n\nFRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF.\n\nCLERK\n(solicitously)\nI'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you\na cab?\n\nThe POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOf course, I could hear what the\nClerk was really saying...\n\n65.\n\n\nCLERK\n(IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION)\nListen, you fuzzy little shithead --\nI've been fucked around, in my\ntime, by a fairly good cross-\nsection of mean-tempered rule-crazy\ncops and now it's MY turn. \"Fuck\nyou, officer, I'm in charge here,\nand I'm telling you we don't have\nroom for you.\"\n\nDUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.\n\nDUKE\nSay.  I hate to interrupt, but I\nwonder if maybe I could just sort\nof slide through and get out of\nyour way.  Name's Raoul Duke --\nRaoul Duke.  My attorney made the\nreservation.\n\nDUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE\ngoes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he\nwas some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The\nCLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.\n\nCLERK\nCertainly, Mr. Duke!\n\nDUKE\nMy bags are out there in that white\nCadillac convertible.  Can you have\nsomeone drive it around to the room?\n\nALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.\n\nDUKE\nOh, and could I get a quart of Wild\nTurkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and\na night's worth of ice delivered to\nmy room, please?\n\nCLERK\nDon't worry about a thing, sir.\nJust enjoy your stay.\n\nDUKE\nWell, thank you.\n\nDUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the\nelevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of\nbeer and toasts them.  The doors close.\n\n66.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE rams the key home -- swings the door open.\n\nDUKE\nAh, home at last!\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON\n\nDUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud.\n\nA 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.\n\nGONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a\ndrug-addled grin on his face.\n\nDUKE\nYou degenerate pig!\n\nGONZO\nIt can't be helped.  This is Lucy.\n(laughing distractedly)\nYou know--like \"Lucy In The Sky\nWith Diamonds.\"\n\nLUCY eyes DUKE venomously.\n\nGONZO\nLucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!\nRemember what happened at the\nairport!  No more of that, okay?\n\nLUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his\narm round her shoulder.\n\nGONZO\nLucy... this is my client.  This is\nMr. Duke, the famous journalist.\nHe's paying for this suite, Lucy.\nHe's on our side.\n\nDUKE flops onto the sofa.\n\nGONZO\nMr. Duke is my friend.  He loves\nartists.\n\nDUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of\nartwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in\ncharcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.\n\nGONZO\nLucy paints portraits of Barbra\nStreisand.\n\n67.\n\n\nLUCY\nI drew these from TV.\n\nGONZO\nFantastic.  She came all the way\ndown here from Montana just to give\nthese portraits to Barbra.  We're\ngoing over to the Americana Hotel\ntonight to meet her backstage...\n\nDUKE's voice rises above GONZO.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI desperately needed peace, rest,\nsanctuary.  I hadn't counted on\nthis.  Finding my attorney on acid\nand locked into some kind of\npreternatural courtship.\n\nDUKE\nWell, I guess they brought the car\nround by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF\nOUT OF THE TRUNK.\n\nDUKE fixes GONZO hard.\n\nGONZO\nAbsolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.\n(to LUCY)\nNow, we'll be right back.  Don't\nanswer the phone if it rings.\n\nLUCY\n(makes one-fingered\nJesus freak sign)\nGod bless.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE collars GONZO -- serious.\n\nDUKE\nWELL?  What are your plans?\n\nGONZO\nPlans?\n\nDUKE\nLucy.\n\n68.\n\n\nGONZO\n(struggling to focus)\nShit.  I met her on the plane and I\nhad all that acid.\n(he shrugs)\nYou know, those little blue barrels.\nI gave her a cap before I realized...\nshe's a religious freak... Jesus,\nshe's never even had a drink.\n\nDUKE\nWell... It'll probably work out.\nWe can keep her loaded and peddle\nher ass at the drug convention.\n\nGONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.\n\nGONZO\nListen, she's running away from\nhome for something like the fifth\ntime in six months.  It's terrible.\n\nDUKE\nShe's perfect for this gig.  These\ncops will go fifty bucks a head to\nbeat her into submission and then\ngang fuck her.  We can set her up\nin one of these back street motels,\nhang pictures of Jesus all over the\nroom, then turn these pigs loose on\nher... Hell she's strong; she'll\nhold her own.\n\nGONZO's face twitches badly.\n\nGONZO\nJesus Christ.  I knew you were sick\nbut I never expected to hear you\nactually say that kind of stuff.\n\nDUKE\nIt's straight economics.  This girl\nis a god-send.  Shit, she can make\nus a grand a day.\n\nGONZO\nNO!  Stop talking like that.\n\nDUKE\nI figure she can do about four at a\ntime.  Christ, if we keep her full\nof acid that's more like two grand\na day.  Maybe three.\n\n69.\n\n\nGONZO\nYou filthy bastard.  I should cave\nyour fucking head in.\n\nDUKE\nIn a few hours, she'll probably be\nsane enough to work herself into a\ntowering Jesus-based rage at the\nhazy recollection of being seduced\nby some kind of cruel Samoan who\nfed her liquor and LSD, dragged her\nto a Vegas hotel room and savagely\npenetrated every orifice in her\nbody with his throbbing,\nuncircumcised member.\n\nGONZO starts crying.\n\nGONZO\nNO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I\nwanted to help her!\n\nDUKE\nYou'll go straight to the gas\nchamber.  And even if you manage to\nbeat that, they'll send you back to\nNevada for Rape and Consensual\nSodomy.  She's got to go.\n\nPause.\n\nGONZO\nShit, it doesn't pay to try to help\nsomebody these days.\n\nA silence.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe only alternative was to take\nher out to the desert and feed her\nremains to the lizards.  But, it\nseemed a bit heavy for the thing we\nwere trying to protect: My attorney.\n\nGONZO\nWe have to cut her loose.  She's\ngot two hundred dollars.  And we\ncan always call the cops up there\nin Montana, where she lives, and\nturn her in.\n\nDUKE\nWhat?... What kind of goddamn\nmonster are you?\n\n70.\n\n\nGONZO\nIt just occurred to me, that she\nhas no witnesses.  Anything that\nshe says about us is completely\nworthless.\n\nDUKE\nUs?\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET\n\nDUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.\n\nDUKE\nHotel Americana?  I need a\nreservation.  For my niece.  Listen,\nI need her treated very gently.\nShe's an artist, and might seem a\ntrifle highstrung...\n\nIn the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the\ndoor.\n\nGONZO\nOkay, Lucy, it's time to go meet\nBarbra...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt like a Nazi, but it had to\nbe done.\n\nEXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK\n\nThe WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps\nLUCY and her paintings from the car.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nLucy was a potentially fatal\nmillstone on both our necks.  There\nwas absolutely no choice but to cut\nher adrift and hope her memory was\nfucked.\n\nGONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --\nwaves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting\nto come down...\n\nGONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands\ntogether as if washing his hands of the situation.\n\nGONZO\nWell that's that.  Take off slowly.\nDon't attract attention.\n\n71.\n\n\nThey pull out into traffic.\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK\n\nGONZO\nI gave the cabbie an extra ten\nbucks to make sure she gets there\nsafe.  Also, I told him I'd be\nthere myself in an hour, and if she\nwasn't, I'd come back out here and\nrip his lungs out.\n\nDUKE\nThat's good.  You can't be subtle\nin this town.\n\nGONZO\nAs your attorney, I advise you to\ntell me where you put the goddamn\nmescaline.\n\nDUKE\nMaybe we should take it easy tonight.\n\nGONZO\nRight.  Let's find a good seafood\nrestaurant and eat some red salmon.\nI feel a powerful lust for red\nsalmon...\n\nThe electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The\nsun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson\ntune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING\n\nGONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.\n\nIn the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.\n\nDUKE\nCome on, we're going to be late.\n\nGONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth\nwith a towel.\n\nGONZO\nThis goddamn mescaline.  Why the\nfuck can't they make it a little\nless pure?  Maybe mix it up with\nRolaids or something.\n\n72.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n(crackling and\nbooming over the\nlousy sound system)\nOn behalf of the prosecuting\nattorneys of this county, I welcome\nyou to the Third National DA's\nConference on Narcotics and\nDangerous Drugs.\n\nThe EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman\ntype -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads:\nNATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. \"If You Don't Know, Come To\nLearn... If You Know, Come To Teach.\"\n\nA BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS\nAND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod\ndress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be\nWITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around\n20 REDNECKS.\n\nA dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles\ndistort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.\n\nAt the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI\nwingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name\ntag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.\n\nGONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,\nCRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.\n\nGONZO\n(lowers his voice)\nI saw these bastards in Easy Rider,\nbut I didn't believe they were real.\nNot like this.  Not hundreds of them!\n\nDUKE\nThey're actually nice people when\nyou get to know them.\n\nGONZO\nMan, I know these people in my\ngoddamn blood!\n\nDUKE\nDon't mention that word around here.\nYou'll get them excited.\n\nGONZO\nThis is a fucking nightmare.\n\n73.\n\n\nDUKE\nRight.  Sure as hell some dope-\ndealing bomb freak is going to\nrecognize you and put the word out\nthat you're partying with a thousand\ncops.\n\nCOP IN BACK\nSSSSHHH!\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST -- a \"drug expert\" -- takes the stage.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nWe must come to terms with the Drug\nCulture in the country... country...\ncountry...\n\nThe sound systems echoes.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nThe reefer butt is called a \"roach,\"\nbecause it resembles a cockroach...\ncockroach... cockroach...\n\nGONZO\n(whispers)\nWhat the fuck are these people\ntalking about?  You'd have to be\ncrazy on acid to think a joint\nlooked like a goddamn cockroach!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt was clear that we had stumbled\ninto a prehistoric gathering.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nNow, there are four states of being\nin the cannabis, or marijuana,\nsociety: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and\nSquare.  The square is seldom if\never cool.  He is not \"with it,\"\nthat is, he doesn't know \"what's\nhappening.\" But if he manages to\nfigure it out, he moves up a notch\nto \"hip.\"\n\nDUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nAnd if he can bring himself to\napprove of what is happening, he\nbecomes \"groovy.\" After that, with\nmuch luck and perseverance, he can\nrise to the rank of \"cool.\" A cool\nguy... cool guy... cool guy...\n\n74.\n\n\nCOP IN BACK\nDr. Bloomquist, do you think the\nanthropologist, Margaret Mead's\nstrange behavior of late might\npossibly be explained by a private\nmarijuana addiction?\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nI really don't know, but at her\nage, if she did smoke grass, she'd\nhave one hell of a trip!\n\nRoars of laughter.\n\nGONZO\nI know a hell of a lot better ways\nto waste my time than listening to\nthis bullshit.\n\nHe stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and\nplunges down the aisle to the door.\n\nCOP IN BACK\nDown in front!\n\nGONZO\nFuck you!  I have to get out!  I\ndon't belong here!\n\nCOP IN BACK\nGood riddance!\n\nHe stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to\nthe stage.\n\nThe lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER\nMADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nKNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE\nMAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be\nable to see his eyes because of\nTea-Shades, but his knuckles will\nbe white from inner tension...\n\nDUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF\nwho necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\n... and his pants will be crusted\nwith semen from constantly jacking\noff when he can't find a rape\nvictim...\n\n75.\n\n\nDUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness,\nhe gets up, hand over mouth.\n\nDUKE\nPardon me, I feel sick.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nHe will stagger and babble when\nquestioned.  He will not respect\nyour badge.  The Dope Fiend fears\nnothing.  He will attack, for no\nreason, with every weapon at his\ncommand -- including yours...\n\nDUKE heads for the exit.\n\nDUKE\nSorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling\nsick...\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nBEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a\nsuspected marijuana addict should\nuse all necessary force immediately.\nOne stitch in time [on him] will\nusually save nine on you.\n\nDUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.\n\nINT. CASINO BAR - DAY\n\nDUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING\nCOP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT\nATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.\n\nDA\nI'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't\nhave much trouble from drugs where\nI come from...\n\nGONZO\nYou will.  One of these nights\nyou'll wake up and find a junkie\ntearing your bedroom apart.\n\nDA\nNaw!\n\nGONZO\nThey'll climb right into your\nbedroom and sit on your chest with\nbig Bowie knives.  They might even\nsit on your wife's chest.  Put the\nblade right down on her throat.\n\n76.\n\n\nDA\nNot down in my parts.\n\nDUKE joins them.\n\nDUKE\n(to WAITRESS)\nRum and ice, please.\n\nDA\n(looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG)\nYou're another one of these\nCalifornia boys.  Your friend\nhere's been tellin' us about dope\nfiends.\n\nDUKE\nThey're everywhere.  Nobody's safe.\nAnd sure as hell not in the South.\nThey like warm weather... You'd\nnever believe it.  In L.A. it's out\nof control.  First it was drugs,\nnow it's witchcraft.\n\nDA\nWitchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!\n\nThe BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the\nconversation.\n\nGONZO\nRead the newspapers.\n\nDUKE\nMan, you don't know trouble until\nyou have to face down a bunch of\nthese addicts gone crazy for human\nsacrifice!\n\nDA\nNaw!  That's science fiction stuff!\n\nDUKE\nNot where we operate.\n\nGONZO\nHell, in Malibu alone, these\ngoddamn Satan worshippers kill six\nor eight people every day.  All\nthey want is the blood.  They'll\ntake people right off the street if\nthey have to.\n\n77.\n\n\nDUKE\nJust the other day we had a case\nwhere they grabbed a girl right out\nof a McDonald's hamburger stand.\nShe was a waitress, about sixteen\nyears old... with a lot of people\nwatching, too!\n\nThe BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more\nfuriously.\n\nDA\nWhat happened?  What did they do to\nher?\n\nGONZO\nDo?  Jesus Christ, man.  They\nchopped her goddamn head off right\nthere in the parking lot!  Then\nthey cut all kinds of holes in her\nhead and sucked out the blood!\n\nDA\n(DA ad-libs a\nsummation of the crime)\nAnd nobody did anything?\n\nDUKE\nWhat could they do?  The guy that\ntook the head was about six-seven,\nand maybe three-hundred pounds.  He\nwas packing two Lugers, and the\nothers had M-16s.\n\nGONZO\nThey just ran back out into Death\nValley -- you know, where Manson\nturned up...\n\nDUKE\nLike big lizards.\n\nGONZO\n... and every one of them stacked\nnaked...\n\nDA\nNaked!?\n\nDUKE\nNaked.\n\n78.\n\n\nGONZO\nYeh, naked!... except for the\nweapons.\n\nDUKE\nThey were all veterans.\n\nDA\nVeterans?!!!?\n\nAgog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes\nthe glass -- faster and faster...\n\nGONZO\nYeh.  The big guy used to be a\nmajor in the Marines.\n\nDA\nA major!\n\nGONZO\nWe know where he lives, but we\ncan't get near the house.\n\nDA\nNaw!  Not a major.\n\nGONZO\nHe wanted the pineal gland.\n\nDA\nReally?\n\nGONZO\nThat's how he got so big.  When he\nquit the Marines he was just a\nlittle guy.\n\nDUKE\nUsually, it's whole families.\nDuring the night.  Most of them\ndon't even wake up until they feel\ntheir heads going -- and then, of\ncourse, it's too late.\n\nThe glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nHappens every day.\n\nDUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.\n\n79.\n\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nThree more rums.  Plenty of ice.\nMaybe a handful of lime chunks.\n\nWAITRESS\nAre you guys with the police\nconvention upstairs?\n\nDA\nWe sure are, Miss.\n\nWAITRESS\nI thought so.  I never heard that\nkind of talk around here before.\nJesus Christ!  How do you guys\nstand that kind of work?\n\nGONZO\n(grinning)\nWe like it.  It's groovy.\n\nThe WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.\n\nDUKE\nWhat's wrong with you?  Hell,\nsomebody has to do it.\n\nGONZO\nHurry up with those drinks.  We're\nthirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine\na Bloody Mary.\n\nDA\n(whacks his fist on\nthe bar)\nHell, I really hate to hear this.\nBecause everything that happens in\nCalifornia seems to get down our\nway, sooner or later.  Mostly\nAtlanta.  But that was back when\nthe goddamn bastards were peaceful.\nAll we had to do was to keep 'em\nunder surveillance.  They didn't\nroam around much... But now Jesus,\nit seems nobody's safe.\n\nGONZO\n(with a conspiratorial\nnod)\nYou're going to need to take the\nbull by the horns -- go to the mat\nwith this scum.\n\n80.\n\n\nDA\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nGONZO\nYou know what I mean.  We've done\nit before and we can damn well do\nit again!\n\nDUKE\nCut their goddamn heads off.  Every\none of them.  That's what we're\ndoing in California.\n\nDA\n(stupefied)\nWHAT?\n\nGONZO\nSure.  It's all on the Q.T., but\neverybody who matters is with us\nall the way down the line.\n\nDUKE\nWe keep it quiet.  It's not the\nkind of thing you'd want to talk\nabout upstairs.  Not with the press\naround.\n\nDA\n(recovering slightly)\nHell, no.  We'd never hear the\ngoddamn end of it.\n\nDUKE\nDobermans don't talk.\n\nDA\nWhat?\n\nGONZO\nSometimes it's easier to just rip\nout the backstraps.\n\nDUKE\nThey'll fight like hell if you try\nto take the head without the dogs.\n\nDA\nGod almighty!\n(muttering in a daze)\nI don't think I should tell my wife\nabout this.  She'd never understand.\nYou know how women are.\n\n81.\n\n\nDUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back.\n\nDUKE\nJust be thankful your heart is\nyoung and strong.\n\nDUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the\nswirling ice in drink.\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.\n\nGONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the\nbathroom.  Immediate sounds of retching.\n\nThe phone message light is blinking.  DUKE opens a beer,\npicks up the phone.\n\nDUKE\nWhat's the message?  My light is\nblinking.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nAh, yes.  Mr. Duke?  You have one\nmessage: \"Call Lucy at the Americana\nHotel, room 1600.\"\n\nDUKE\nHoly shit!\n\nDUKE slams the phone down.  GONZO emerges from the\nbathroom -- looking like death.\n\nDUKE\nLucy called.\n\nGONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.\n\nGONZO\nWhat?\n\nThe telephone rings.  DUKE answers.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY\n\nA worried CLERK speaks in to the phone.\n\nCLERK\nMr. Duke?  Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm\nsorry we were cut off a moment\nago... I thought I should call\nagain, because I was wondering...\n\n82.\n\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE\nWHAT?\n(hand over the PHONE)\nWhat was that crazy bitch said to\nhim?\n(screams)\nThere's a war on, man!  People are\nbeing killed!\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nKilled?\n\nDUKE\nIN VIETNAM!  ON THE GODDAMN\nTELEVISION!\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nOh... yes... yes... This terrible\nwar.  When will it end?\n\nDUKE\nTell me.  What do you want?\n\nIn the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his\nstash from the lining.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nThe woman who left that message for\nyou sounded very disturbed.  I\nthink she was crying...\n\nDUKE\nCrying?  Why was she crying?\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nWell, uh.  She didn't say Mr. Duke.\nBut since I know you're here with\nthe Police Convention...\n\nDUKE\nLook, you want to be gentle with\nthat woman if she ever calls again.\nWe're watching her very carefully...\nthis woman has been into laudanum.\nIt's a controlled experiment, but I\nsuspect we'll need your cooperation\nbefore this thing is over.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\n(hesitantly)\nWell, certainly... We're always\nhappy to cooperate with the police...\n\n83.\n\n\nDUKE\nDon't worry.  You're protected.\nJust treat this poor woman like\nyou'd treat any other human being\nin trouble.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nWhat?  Ah... yes, yes, I see what\nyou mean... Yes... so, you'll be\nresponsible then?\n\nDUKE\nOf course.  And now I have to get\nback to the news.  Send up some ice.\n\nHe hangs up.  GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.\n\nGONZO\nGood work.  They'll treat us like\ngoddamn lepers after that.\n\nDUKE\n(slowly, carefully)\nLucy is looking for you.\n\nGONZO\n(laughing)\nNo, she's looking for you.\n\nDUKE\nMe?\n\nGONZO\nShe really flipped over you.  The\nonly way I could get rid of her was\nby saying you were taking me out to\nthe desert for a showdown -- that\nyou wanted me out of the way so you\ncould have her all to yourself.\n(laughing again)\nI guess she figures you won.  That\nphone message wasn't for me, was it?\n\nA look of stunned realization from DUKE...\n\nINT.

HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE is madly stuffing his suitcase.\n\nGONZO\nWait!  You can't leave me alone in\nthis snake pit.  This room is in my\nname.\n\nDUKE KEEPS PACKING.  GONZO is looking worried.\n\nGONZO\nOK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call\nher.  I'll get her off our backs.\nYou're right.  She's my problem.\n\nDUKE\nIt's gone too far.\n\nGONZO\nRelax.  Let me handle this.\n(dials the PHONE,\nsnaps angrily at DUKE)\nYou'd make a piss-poor lawyer.\n...Room 1600, please.\n(to DUKE)\nAs your attorney, I advise you not\nto worry.\n(nods towards bathroom)\nTake a hit out of that little brown\nbottle in my shaving kit.\n\nDUKE goes in the bathroom.  He finds a little bottle -- a\nlabel: \"DRINK ME.\"\n\nDUKE\nWhat is this?\n\n85.\n\n\nGONZO\nYou won't need much.  Just a little\ntiny taste, that stuff makes pure\nmescaline seem like ginger-beer.\nAdrenochrome.\n\nDUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.\n\nDUKE\nAdrenochrome...\n\nGONZO\n(into PHONE)\nHi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got\nyour message...what?  Hell, no, I\ntaught the bastard a lesson he'll\nnever forget... what?  No, not\ndead, but he won't be bothering\nanybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left\nhim out there, I stomped him, then\npulled all his teeth out...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember thinking, \"Jesus, what a\nterrible thing to lay on somebody\nwith a head full of acid.\"\n\nDUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies\nit -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...\n\nGONZO\n(to PHONE)\nBut here's the problem.  That\nbastard cashed a bad check\ndownstairs and gave you as a\nreference.  They'll be looking for\nboth of you.  Yeah, I know, but you\ncan't judge a book by its cover,\nLucy.  Some people are just\nbasically rotten... Anyway, the\nlast thing you want to do is call\nthis hotel again; they'll trace the\ncall and put you straight behind\nbars... no, I'm moving to the\nTropicana right away.  I have to\ngo, they've got the phone tapped.\nYeah, I know, it was horrible, but\nit's all over now... OH MY GOD!\nTHEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN!\n(throws the PHONE\ndown; shouts)\nNo!  Get away from me!  I'm innocent!\nIt was Duke!  I swear to God!\n(MORE)\n\n86.\n\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\n(stomps the PHONE; moans)\nNo, I don't know where she is.\nYou'll never catch Lucy!  She's\ngone!  I swear, I don't know where\nshe is!  DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME!\n(slams the PHONE down)\n\n\nGONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.\n\nGONZO\nWell.  That's that.  She's probably\nstuffing herself down the\nincinerator about now.  That's the\nlast we should be hearing from Lucy.\n(fumbling with the\nhash pipe)\nWhere's the opium?\n\nDUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY\nSTRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember slumping on the bed, his\nperformance had given me a bad jolt.\nFor a moment I thought his mind had\nsnapped -- that he actually believed\nhe was being attacked by invisible\nenemies.  But the room was quiet\nagain.\n\nDUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.\n\nDUKE\nWhere'd you get this?\n\nGONZO\nNever mind, it's absolutely pure.\n\nDUKE\nJesus... what kind of monster\nclient have you picked up this time?\nThere's only one source for this\nstuff -- the adrenaline gland from\na living human body!\n\nGONZO turns to smile at DUKE.\n\n87.\n\n\nGONZO\nI know, but the guy didn't have any\ncash to pay me.  He's one of these\nSatanism freaks.  He offered me\nhuman blood -- said it would take\nme higher than I've ever been in my\nlife.\n(laughs -- struts\nround DUKE -- eyes\nbright with expectation)\nI thought he was kidding, so I told\nhim I'd just as soon have an ounce\nor so of pure adrenochrome -- or\nmaybe just a fresh adrenaline gland\nto chew on.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI could already feel the stuff\nworking on me -- the first wave\nfelt like a combination of mescaline\nand methedrine -- maybe I should\ntake a swim, I thought...\n\nDUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...\n\nGONZO\nYeah, they nailed this guy for\nchild molesting.  He swore he\ndidn't do it. \"Why should I fuck\nwith children?\" he says. \"They're\ntoo small.\" Christ, werewolf is\nentitled to legal counsel.  I\ndidn't dare turn the creep down.\nHe might have picked up a letter\nopener and gone after my pineal\ngland!\n\nGONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS\nGOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  We should get some of\nthat.  Just eat a big handful and\nsee what happens.\n\nGONZO\nSome of what?\n\nDUKE\n(spitting words)\nExtract of pineal!\n\n88.\n\n\nGONZO\n(STARING AT DUKE WITH\nA STRANGE SMILE)\nSure.  That's a good idea.  One\nwhiff of that shit would turn you\ninto something out of a goddamn\nmedical encyclopedia.\n\nGONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.\n\nGONZO\nMan, your head would swell up like\na watermelon, you'd probably gain\nabout a hundred pounds in two\nhours...\n\nA CLOVEN HOOF BURSTS THROUGH GONZO'S SHOE.\n\nDUKE\nRight!\n\nGONZO\n... grow claws... bleeding warts.\n\nGONZO'S CHEST EXPANDS -- BONY RIBS BURSTING HIS SHIRT.\n\nDUKE\nYes!\n\nGONZO\n... then you'd notice about six\nhuge hairy tits swelling up on your\nback...\n\nA TAIL LASHES, HOOFS STRIKE THE FLOOR.  GONZO TOWERS -- A\nFLAME RED DEMON!\n\nDUKE\nFantastic!\n\nDUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY\nat the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM.  His\nheels are dug into the mattress with both KNEES LOCKED,\nEYEBALLS SWELLING.\n\nGONZO-DEMON LOOMS AGAINST THE CEILING.\n\nGONZO\nyou'd go blind... your body would\nturn to wax... they'd have to put\nyou in a wheelbarrow and...\n\nGONZO'S VOICE FADES AWAY -- DUKE'S frenzied gaze reveals\nGONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE.\n\n89.\n\n\nGONZO\nMan I'll try about anything; but\nI'd never touch a pineal gland.\n\nDUKE\nFINISH THE FUCKING STORY!  What\nhappened?!  What about the glands?\n\nGONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily...\ntowards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...\n\nGONZO\nJesus, that stuff got right on top\nof you, didn't it.\n\nVEINS stand out on DUKE's forehead.  He is purplish-red.\nOVER THE TOP!  Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!\n\nDUKE\nMaybe you could just... shove me\ninto the pool, or something...\n\nGONZO shakes his head disgustedly.\n\nGONZO\nIf I put you in the pool right now,\nyou'd sink like a goddamn stone.\nYou took too much.  Jesus, look at\nyour face, you're about to explode.\n\nGONZO sits back down... watching the TV.\n\nGONZO\nDon't try and fight it, or you'll\nget brain bubbles.  Strokes,\naneurysms.  You'll just wither up\nand die.\n\nDUKE FALLS TO THE GROUND, WRITHING, CATATONIC, SINKING INTO\nPARALYSIS.\n\nAND THE SOUND, SUDDENLY AND STRANGELY, OF THE VOICE OF\nRICHARD NIXON AND HIS DISTORTED FACE ON THE TV SCREEN.\n\nNIXON\nSacrifice... sacrifice...\nsacrifice...\n\nDUKE PASSES OUT.\n\nBLACK SCREEN\n\n90.\n\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDarkness.  Insanely, somewhere NILSSON plays -- \"Put the\nlime in the coconut and mix em all up...\"\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhat kind of rat-bastard psychotic\nwould play that song -- right now,\nat this moment?\n\nDUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in.  He lies,\nawkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been\nthere days -- months.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhen I came to the general back\nalley ambiance of the suite was so\nrotten, so incredibly foul.  How\nlong had I been lying there?  Hours?\nDays?  Months?  All these signs of\nviolence.  What had happened?\n\nDUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE\nSIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving\nwhisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights\nreplace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,\npornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered\non a shattered mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was evidence in this room of\nexcessive consumption of almost\nevery type of drug known to\ncivilized man since 1544 AD.\n\nDUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --\nHOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut what kind of addict would need\nall these coconut husks and crushed\nhoneydew rinds?  Would the presence\nof junkies account for all these\nuneaten french fries?  These\npuddles of glazed ketchup on the\nbureau?  Maybe so, but then why all\nthis booze?  And these crude\npornographic photos smeared with\nmustard that had dried to a hard\nyellow crust...\n\nDUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT\nRAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.\n\n91.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThese were not the hoof prints of\nyour normal god-fearing junkie.  It\nwas too savage, too aggressive.\n\nQUICK FLASHBACK:\n\nGONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER:\n\nBACK IN THE ROOM:\n\nDUKE stares at the smashed mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nGrim memories and bad flashbacks.\n\nIn the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN\nVOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS.\n\nDUKE unzips and pisses.  THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE\nMAGNUM .357!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSomething ugly had happened.  I was\nsure of it...\n\nDUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.\n\nThe SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.\n\nDUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out\nof the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE\nSMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...\nsleeping on the sofa.\n\nThe ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.\n\nA hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO\ngrappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is\nmuffling her screams with an ice bag.\n\nMAID\nPlease... please... I'm only the\nmaid.  I didn't mean nothin!...\n\nDUKE\n(jumps up from the\nbed, flashing his\npress badge)\nYOU'RE UNDER ARREST!\n\n92.\n\n\nGONZO\n(to DUKE)\nShe must have used a pass key.  I\nwas polishing my shoes in the\ncloset when I noticed her sneaking\nin-so I took her.\n\nDUKE shakes his head.\n\nDUKE\n(barks at the MAID)\nWhat made you do it?  Who paid you\noff?\n\nMAID\nNobody.  I'm the maid!\n\nGONZO\nYou're lying!  You were after the\nevidence.  Who put you up to\nthis -- the manager?\n\nMAID\nI don't know what you're talking\nabout!\n\nGONZO\nBullshit!  You're just as much a\npart of it as they are!\n\nMAID\nPart of what?\n\nDUKE\nThe dope ring.  You must know\nwhat's going on in this hotel.  Why\ndo you think we're here?\n\nMAID\n(blubbering)\nI know you're cops, but I thought\nyou were just here for that\nconvention.  I swear!  All I wanted\nto do was clean up the room.  I\ndon't know anything about dope!\n\nGONZO laughs.\n\nGONZO\nCome on, baby don't try to tell us\nyou never heard of the Grange Gorman.\n\n93.\n\n\nMAID\nNo!  No!  I swear to Jesus I never\nheard of that stuff!\n\nDUKE\nMaybe she's telling the truth.\nMaybe she's not part of it.\n\nMAID\nNo!  I swear I'm not!\n\nGONZO\n(long pause)\nIn that case, maybe she can help.\n\nMAID\nYes!  I'll help you all you need!\nI hate dope!\n\nDUKE\nSo do we, lady.\n\nGONZO\n(helping her up)\nI think we should put her on the\npayroll.  See what she comes up with.\n\nDUKE\nDo you think you can handle it?\n\nMAID\nWhat?\n\nGONZO\nOne phone call every day.  Just\ntell us what you've seen.  Don't\nworry if it doesn't add up, that's\nour problem.\n\nGONZO hustles the MAID to the door.\n\nMAID\nYou'd pay me for that?\n\nDUKE\nYou're damn right.  But the first\ntime you say anything about this,\nto anybody -- you'll go straight to\nprison for the rest of your life.\nWhat's your name?\n\nMAID\nAlice.  Just ring Linen Service and\nask for Alice.\n\n94.\n\n\nGONZO\nAlright, Alice... you'll be\ncontacted by Inspector Rock.\nArthur Rock.  He'll be posing as a\npolitician.\n\nDUKE\nInspector Rock will pay you.  In\ncash.  A thousand dollars on the\nninth of every month.\n\nMAID\nOh Lord!  I'd do just about anything\nfor that!\n\nGONZO\nYou and a lot of other people.\n\nDUKE\nThe password is: \"One Hand Washes\nThe Other.\" The minute you hear\nthat, you say \"I fear nothing.\"\n\nMAID\nI fear nothing.\n\nShe repeats the password several times while they listen to\nmake sure she has it right.\n\nGONZO\nOh, and don't bother to make up the\nroom.  That way we won't have to\nrisk another of these little\nincidents, will we?\n\nMAID\nWhatever you say, gentlemen.  I\ncan't tell you how sorry I am about\nwhat happened...\n\nGONZO\nDon't worry, it's all over now.\nThank God for the decent people.\n\nShe smiles, repeating to herself \"One Hand Washes The Other\"\nas GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.\n\nCUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.\n\nA grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.\n\nGONZO ON TAPE\n... Thank God for the decent people.\n\n95.\n\n\nDUKE sits in the middle of the wrecked suite with his\nmangled tape recorder in front of him.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMemories of that night are extremely\nhazy...\n\nDUKE fast forwards through the tape -- SEARCHING: \"Awwww,\nmama... can this really...be the end...?\"\n\nEXT. SAFEWAY SUPERMARKET - DAY\n\nThe WHITE WHALE waits -- gleaming -- beautiful.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere is a definite obligation,\nwhen you boom around Vegas in a\nwhite Coupe de Ville, to maintain a\ncertain style.\n\nDUKE and GONZO burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping\nbasket loaded with COCONUTS, GRAPEFRUIT and TEQUILA.  They\nsend DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.\n\nThe trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather\nat the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with\njunk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.\n\nDUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects\na coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO\npulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering\nCROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!\n\nA GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.\n\nDUKE places another coconut.  SMASH!  Milk and white meat\nflies everywhere.\n\nSHOPPER #1\nHey!  Is that your car?\n\nDUKE\nSure is.\n\nSMASH!  Coconut fragments fly.\n\nDUKE\nAny of you folks want the milk?\nWe're after the meat.

No hassles, no talk.  Just\na place to rest and regroup.  I\nwasn't even hungry.\n\nGONZO stuffs a hamburger down PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE\nBEATING going on outside the window.

She turns.\n\nWAITRESS\nWhat is this?\n\nGONZO\nA napkin.\n\nTHE WAITRESS slams the napkin down on the counter.\n\nWAITRESS\nDon't give me that bullshit!  I\nknow what it means!

He PULLS OUT THE RAZOR-\nSHARP HUNTING KNIFE.\n\nGONZO KEEPS HIS EYES ON THE WAITRESS.  He walks about six\nfeet down the aisle and lifts the receiver of the pay phone.\nHe SLICES IT OFF, then brings the receiver back to his stool\nand sits down.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI was stupid with shock -- not\nknowing whether to run or start\nlaughing.\n\nGONZO\n(casual)\nHow much is the lemon meringue pie?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHer eyes were turgid with fear, but\nher brain was functioning on some\nbasic motor survival level.\n\nWAITRESS\n(blurting -- on automatic)\nThirty-five cents!\n\nGONZO\n(laughing)\nI mean the whole pie.\n\nThe WAITRESS MOANS.

Okay?\n\n104.\n\n\nGONZO walks round the counter TAKING THE PIE OUT OF THE\nDISPLAY CASE.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe sight of the blade had triggered\nbad memories.  The glazed look in\nher eyes said her throat had been\ncut.  She was still in the grip of\nparalysis when we left.\n\nDUKE IS ROOTED TO THE SPOT.\n\nGONZO urges him out the door.  The camera retreats with them.\n\nThe WAITRESS STANDS THERE -- PETRIFIED.  Alone in a lousy\nbar at night.\n\nINT.

You were\nsupposed to turn back there!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had abused every rule that Vegas\nlived by -- burning the locals,\nabusing the tourists, terrifying\nthe help.  The only chance now, I\nfelt, was the possibility that we'd\ngone to such excess that nobody in\nthe position to bring the hammer\ndown on us could possibility\nbelieve it.\n\nDUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.\n\n105.\n\n\nGONZO\nJesus Christ!!!\n\nThere, crossing the road in front of them, is LUCY -- her\npaintings under her arm -- looking lost.

WHEELS CHURNING,\nHE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight\nup, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER\nA FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the\nRUNWAY.\n\nGONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He\nthrows a worried look at DUKE.\n\nDUKE\nI'll drop you right next to the\nplane.\n\nThey SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET\nENGINE SCREAM.\n\nGONZO\nNo!  I can't get out!

Shit, this town is full of\nwhite Cadillac convertibles.  I\nplan to go through there so fast\nthat nobody will even glimpse the\ngoddamn license plate.  You ready?\n\nGONZO\nWhy not?  But for Christ's sake,\njust do it fast!\n\nEXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY\n\nDUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.

Too weird to\nlive and too rare to die.\n\n107.\n\n\nDUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH\nTHE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT\n\nOn the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find\nDUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his\ntypewriter.\n\nDUKE\nWe are all wired into a survival\ntrip now.  No more of the speed\nthat fueled that 60's.  That was\nthe fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.\nHe crashed around America selling\n\"consciousness expansion\" without\never giving a thought to the grim\nmeat-hook realities that were lying\nin wait for all the people who took\nhim seriously...\n\nDUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly\nrises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT\nIMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.\n\nDUKE\nAll those pathetically eager acid\nfreaks who thought they could buy\nPeace and Understanding for three\nbucks a hit.  But their loss and\nfailure is ours too.  What Leary\ntook down with him was the central\nillusion of a whole life-style that\nhe helped create...\n\nRISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30\nFEET HIGH.  DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE\nCAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...\n\nDUKE\n... a generation of permanent\ncripples, failed seekers, who never\nunderstood the essential old-mystic\nfallacy of the Acid Culture: the\ndesperate assumption that somebody...\nor at least some force -- is\ntending the light at the end of the\ntunnel.\n\nHIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX\nSURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON\nSIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT\nLIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.\n\n108.\n\n\nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY\n\nA BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE\nDRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out\nof the back seat as he takes a bump.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was only one road back to L.A.\nUS Interstate 15, just a flat-out\nhigh speed burn through Baker and\nBarstow and Berdoo, then on to the\nHollywood Freeway straight into\nfrantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,\njust another freak in the Freak\nKingdom.\n\nDUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING\nfacing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon\nsign that flashes beer.\n\nDUKE\nAhhh.  Wonderful.\n\nDUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.\n\nINT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY\n\nDUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all\nabout the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON\nWHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE\nRAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD\nMAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden\nbar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.\n\nPROPRIETOR\nWhat'll you have?\n\nDUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.\n\nDUKE\n(doubtfully)\nBallantine Ale...?\n\nTHE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES AND\nRELAXES.\n\nDUKE\nHard to find it served like this\nanymore.\n\nAs he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE\nAMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY\nPIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack\nreads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.\n\n109.\n\n\nPROPRIETOR\nWhere ya comin' from, young man?\n\nDUKE\nLas Vegas.\n\nPROPRIETOR\nA great town, that Vegas.  I bet\nyou had good luck there.  You're\nthe type.\n\nDUKE\nI know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.\n\nPROPRIETOR\n(trustingly)\nThat's a fine combination.  You\ncan't lose.\n\nA LOVELY GIRL appears.  Seeing DUKE, she smiles.  CAN THIS\nREALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY?  She approaches him... and...\nKISSES THE PROPRIETOR.\n\nDUKE\n(caught off guard... muttering)\nOh, my God!...\n\nPROPRIETOR\n(not understanding)\nThis is my granddaughter...\n\nDUKE\n(recovering)\nDon't worry...\n(leans forward in confidence)\n... and I'm actually the District\nAttorney from Ignoto County.\n(winks)\nJust another good American like\nyourself.\n\nA MOMENT.  THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.\n\nWordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the\nback of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.\n\nWHO FEELS ASHAMED.\n\nDUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.\n\nEXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY\n\nA CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.\nGets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...\n\n110.\n\n\nA state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.\n\nSomberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags\nstep off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...\n\nDUKE switches on the ignition.  Something rolls off the\ntrembling dash... DUKE catches it...\n\nONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...\n\nDUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.  THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --\nTEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.\n\nDUKE\nHOLY SHIT!!!\n\nDUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT\nTHE MARINES.\n\nDUKE\nGOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!\n\nDUKE ROARS AWAY.  AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS\nIN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE\nCONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nThe TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.\n\nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY\n\nDUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!\n\nDUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy heart was filled with joy.

Nothing.\nNothing.\nI'm okay.\nI've got a I've got a bug.\n[GROANS] Please, I've taken you to rehab too many times to buy that crap.\nI'm all right.\n[PANTING] [DISTORTED] This isn't like last time.\n[NORMAL] Then I must be having d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3  vu.\n'Cause you sure look like your old, strung-out self.\nThere you go.\nAll right.\n- [GROANS] - Eyes up.\nOh, thank you.\n[SIGHING] Look, thank you for, uh for taking care of me and bailing me out and everything.\nI just I'm I'm gonna be okay.\nI'm fine now.\nI should think so, after sleeping so long.\n- What? - But we've got a big day today.\nWe've gotta choose the right wardrobe.\nWait.\nHow long have I been asleep? Mother, how long have I been asleep? About 26 hours.\nI lost a whole day? Don't worry, I covered for you at the radio station.\nSo, this is the one.\nYou shower.\nI'll heat up the flat iron.\nI don't have time to play dress-up.\nI have to call Jessica.\n- Jessica is in jail.\n- What [SIGHS] Which is where she should be.\nWe don't know if she killed that poor man.\nOf course she didn't.\nEither way, she's got that fancy lawyer.\nThere's nothing you can do for her.\n- No, you don't understand - I understand better than anyone.\nJess has always brought out the worst in you and I won't watch it cost you another career.\n- This is not about my career.\n- ZCN called.\n- What? - Cable news, Pats.\nThis is big-time.\nThey wanted a meeting with you.\nWhen? Today.\nDon't worry.\nWe'll be on time.\nThe rest of your life is waiting.\nI'm gonna get in the shower.\nIt's all gone? Yeah, your computer, our files, everything IGH.\n[SIGHS] Shit.\nHands off the gun, itchy fingers.\nThe guy took everything.\nI guess Pryce was casing the place when he came to recruit me.\n- And I should have known, but - It's okay.\nI'm not mad at you.\nHave they got you on sedatives? No, I'm just trying something new.\nApparently, I'm alienating.\n[SIGHS] It's time to earn your 20%.\nExcuse me? [SIGHS] I need your help.\n[CHUCKLES] Excuse me? Don't goddamn push me, Malcolm.\nUm I'm all in.\nGo.\nMy friend, the one that's staying with you? Yeah.\n[SIGHS] Find out everything she knows about her former employers and about her coworker who suddenly left the company.\nGot it.\nWhat else? Everything else.\nAt least until I can get out of this hellhole.\nWhen's that gonna be? Depends on if I can get through this next part without losing my shit.\nYou didn't do the crime.\nTruth matters.\nNot if nobody wants to believe it.\n[SIGHS] You're in charge of Alias.\nDon't mess it up.\n[SIGHS] [CLEARS THROAT] Bummer.\nYou didn't get to shoot me.\n[KETTLE WHISTLING] [EXHALES] [PIANO PLAYING] [HUMS] Not much money, oh, but, honey Ain't we got fun? The rent's unpaid, dear We haven't a car But anyway, dear We'll stay as we are Even if we owe [KNOCKING ON WINDOW] [WOMAN] Hello.\n[KNOCKING CONTINUES] [CHUCKLES] Hi! It's just your neighbor.\nSophie.\nRemember? We met at the yard sale.\n- Something wrong? - I'm losing my mind.\n[CHUCKLES] Aaron is teething, and he's been screaming at me for hours.\n- He's not screaming now.\n- Because of your music.\nWe were walking past, he heard it and calmed right down.\n[BABY BABBLING] Isn't that right, you little monster? - Well, I was just practicing.\n- Well, he is a big fan.\nWould you mind if we came in and listened? Honestly, I could use a break.\nWould you like to hold him? Yes, I would.\n[BABY COOING] - Come in.\n- [SIGHS] Thank you.\nI can't remember the last time I heard a song that wasn't about farm animals.\nYour home is so cool.\nMarcus and I have to have you over sometime.\nI don't get out much.\nCome here, baby.\nOh! Ooh [BABY FUSSING] [CLICKS TONGUE] No.\n[SHUSHING] Not much money, oh, but, honey [NOTES FALTER] - Sorry.\n- [CHUCKLES] Please.\nWe're crashing your practice.\n- [BABY FUSSING] - No, no, no.\nIt's okay.\n[BREATHING HEAVILY] [BABY CRYING] It's okay.\nIt's okay.\nShh, Aaron Oh, oh, please.\n[BABY CONTINUES CRYING] [NOTES FALTERING] Are you all right? You know, I just - He's been terrible today.\nI - [BABY WAILING] [GRUNTING] [PANTING] [SIGHS HEAVILY] I can't guarantee that this is gonna work.\nWell, it better.\nI'm taking your legal advice.\nI gave you that advice this morning.\nNow it might be too little, too late.\nAfternoon.\nComfortable in your, uh, new digs? Like a veal for slaughter.\n[SUNDAY] Your lawyer tells us you want to make a statement.\nDid you bring my phone? [SIGHS] This woman killed Nick Spanos and Robert Coleman.\nShe also has abilities.\n- Like you? - No.\nShe's stronger.\nA lot stronger.\n- You got a name on her? - Not yet.\nBut we were both patients at an off-the-grid experimental program called IGH.\nThey tried to heal people using genetic editing.\nBut there were side effects.\n- [COSTA] This IGH gave you abilities? - [JESSICA] Looks that way.\nYou forgot to mention these experiments or this other enhanced person when we questioned you.\n- Because you can't take her.\n- But you can? - [SUNDAY] You have proof of any of this? - [SIGHS] The best I can do is tell you everything I know.\nI'll start at the beginning.\n[MALCOLM] You don't know who you worked for? - Not their names.\n- \"They\"? Was it more than one person? - Did they pay you to keep quiet? - I keep quiet to stay alive.\nUnlike the nurse you worked with.\nLuanne McClure? Where did you find that? There's an online black market for crime scene pics.\nPeople pay money to see that? You said Luanne was killed in the clinic, but her body was found in a bathtub in a guy's apartment.\nGet that out of my face.\nI spent years trying to unsee that shit.\nJust help me try to understand something.\nIf the powered woman we're looking for killed Luanne, then why Why is this guy doing time for Luanne's murder? Hey, I get that you're scared.\nReally.\nBut you have to trust me.\nThis is what we do.\nSit down.\nStart at the beginning.\n- What is taking so long? - It's a lot to process.\n[SIGHS DEEPLY] What's the matter? Why do you look like that? Trying not to vomit.\n[SIGHS] 'Cause I'm screwed.\nSide effects from my goddamn medication.\n[HOGARTH SIGHS] Ran a search on your photo.\nDidn't find a name or any criminal record.\n[JESSICA] Because she's off the grid.\nI'm telling you the truth.\n- I know.\n- I don't.\n- Let's stick with knowing.\nHow? - [COSTA] It's a couple of stills taken from a network of security cameras in the area.\nThat's taken just before the time of Nick Spanos' death.\n- That's right in front of my building.\n- [COSTA] Now, wait for it It's a hell of a leap.\n[SIGHS] And? That's it? I'm free to go? [SUNDAY] Not if I had my way.\nI think you two are working together.\nI know how you people like to team up.\n\"You people\"? [COSTA] There's no reason to keep you if you cooperate.\nGreat.\nUh, thank you, Detective.\nUh, Jessica, I'll meet you outside.\nHey, listen, just in case you come up with anything else for us One show-and-tell doesn't make us partners.\nYou want to go it alone, that's your call.\nBut there's a lot of people on the force that wanna see you locked up.\nAnd you're the only white hat in a sea of black hats.\nNot the only one.\nThere's a few of us here who remember what Kilgrave did in this precinct.\nI had nightmares of holding my own gun to my head.\nThe feeling of my finger on the trigger.\nI recommend hypnosis.\nI didn't need that, because, uh the dreams stopped the day you took that asshole out.\n- [JESSICA] Thanks.\n- [HOGARTH] Doing my job.\nI'll do my job and get the leverage you want on your firm.\nBut I need something else first.\nDid you read the story of The Giving Tree as a kid? The tree ends up a dead stump.\nI'm not anxious to go there any sooner than I have to.\nI just need a safe house.\nThe kind you use for your witness protection clients.\nWhat kind of witness are we talking about? The kind that needs protection? So we're going back to the old secretive Jessica.\n- Because that worked for you in jail.\n- [SIGHS] Shit.\nFine.\nI found someone who used to work for IGH.\nYou left that out of your statement with the police.\nBecause this woman's safety is my responsibility.\n- Okay, get her to me.\nI'll handle it.\n- Handle it how? So it's handled.\nYour paranoia is exhausting.\nWhere the hell are you going? Where's my computer, asshole? Don't engage with him, Jessica.\nCan't believe they let you out.\nI can't believe they didn't arrest you for stealing my shit.\nOh, I heard everything you did to Nick.\nEvery scream.\n- We survived two wars together until you.\n- [SIGHS] - It wasn't me.\n- Pryce, you are embarrassing yourself.\nYou're the embarrassment, Jeri.\nHelping her out? Huh? What was it, bribery? Perjury? - I'll find out.\n- Hey.\nGet your head out of your ass, Cheng.\nOr what? What are you gonna do, huh? Take me out, too? I've seen you in action.\nI've seen that look in your eye.\nYou're a killer.\nNot today, I'm not.\nToday, I'm free.\nDo you know why? No, 'cause you're a shitty investigator.\nSo go talk to the cops, go steal someone else's cases.\nYou know what? Go beat off in the corner, because I don't give a dead moose's last shit.\nI'm gonna find the actual killer.\n[SIGHS] I bought you a new one.\nI mean, Alias bought it.\nLooks good, though, huh? Little paint, little cleaning.\nI need a drink.\n[DOOR OPENS] - Hey, how you holding up? - Just trapped in a hellish flashback.\n[SCOFFS] I know the feeling.\nYou know what's great for that? Oh, come on.\nThey took my booze, too? [SIGHS] Well, what else did you find, besides new places to put all my shit? Here.\n[SIGHS] That's David Kawecki.\nHe was the janitor at IGH.\nLuanne's body was found in his apartment.\nHe confessed to the murder.\nBut Inez says that he wasn't even there when it happened.\nRight? Everyone lies.\nThat's for damn sure.\nIt says here he has the IQ of a ten-year-old.\nCourt found him mentally incompetent.\n- He's doing life in Birch Psych Hospital.\n- It's horseshit.\nDave was harmless.\nAre you sure? You think I could forget the woman who almost crippled me? You think I don't see her face every time I close my eyes? [MALCOLM] Hey, take a break.\nGo to my apartment, lock the door.\nI'll be there in a minute.\n- Jesus.\n- [SIGHS] Yeah, she is special.\nThe killer likes to pin her shit on other people.\nThis dude Kawecki is doing her time.\nQuestion is, why? I'll ask him when I see him.\nAlready tried.\nKawecki's kept in the hospital's high-security wing.\nOnly guards and shrinks with IDs allowed in.\nI got it from here.\nYou get Inez to Jeri Hogarth.\nAt this address.\nTell her you're my associate.\nWait, did Did you just promote me? Maybe.\n[CHUCKLES] - Does it come with a raise? - No.\nGet going.\nWhatever you say, associate.\n[LAUGHS] I'm instantly regretting this.\nInez? Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.\n[DOOR CLOSES] Hey! You're gonna have to go all the way to 37th before you find a pawn shop that'll take a hot TV.\nThat's where I used to sell shit when I was a junkie.\nThey don't sweat the serial numbers.\nI bet you can buy it back from them real cheap.\nLook, I am not the person that you need to be running from right now.\nI'm just trying to get you someplace safe.\nYeah, that last place was real safe.\nExcept for the homicide out front.\n- What? - I'll take my chances on my own.\nYeah, and what? Your big idea is to sell my TV for a couple of bucks? Enough to get out of town.\nLook, the killer will find you.\nAll right? And when she does, you can't stop her.\n- No one can.\n- Jessica can.\nShe has a plan.\nYeah, which part of that plan included her going to jail? - Tell your boss thanks, but no thanks.\n- All right, cool.\nYou don't want to climb on board, be the bait in the water.\nThe hell is that supposed to mean? Killer's taking out people who worked for IGH.\nI could post your location online, wait for her to come to us.\nYou wouldn't do that.\nI'll do whatever it takes.\nYou win.\n[SIGHS] Hey.\nThey let you out? Sorry about all the cops.\nTold 'em you had nothing to do with it.\nCome on.\nCome in.\nSo, what makes you so sure? I don't think the woman that saved Vido's life is capable of murder.\nI still owe you for that.\nAbout that.\n[SIGHS] I may need to collect.\nHow about dinner? Like a date? Or just dinner? Or [CLEARS THROAT] do you have something else in mind? Uh [SIGHS] Let's say, hypothetically, I needed to get into a secure psych ward.\n- You want me to commit you? - As a therapist.\nAnd let's say that I needed the right ID.\nAnd in this hypothetical situation, you need someone who could forge documents? Someone that owed me a favor.\nWho'd risk their family's safety to break the law for you.\n- That's a big ask.\n- I know.\n[SIGHS] I need the name of the hospital and three hours.\nThank you.\nI'm also gonna need a photo.\nDon't smile.\n[CHUCKLES] [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] Griffin? - [GRIFFIN] It's Trish.\nShe needs you, now.\n- Why? - I'll text you the address.\n- Griffin? Ugh.\n[DOROTHY] Hurry up! [SIGHS] - Why does ZCN want to meet out here? - Ambiance is everything.\n- Last looks.\n- Mother.\n- It's better.\n- Yeah? [SIGHS] You know what they say, \"Always put your best face forward.\n\" \"Best foot.\n\" No one's gonna be looking at your feet, Pats.\nOkay, let's not keep them waiting.\n[SIGHS] You look beautiful.\nOkay.\n[INDISTINCT CHATTER] - Who are all those - Hey.\n[TRISH] Wait, I know him.\nIs that Is that Aunt Alice and Uncle Tim? Okay, Mother, if this is another intervention, - please, I don't need it - Shh.\nNo, no, no.\nThis morning will be our little secret.\n[JESSICA] Trish! [SIGHS] I came as soon as I could.\nAre you okay? Jess, what Hey, love I don't need to scream and shout it And you don't ever need to doubt it If everything looks black and white I'll be the color Hey, love If you want a song to say it I'll be the one to play it A single line from bended knee Will you share a life with me? Hey.\nHi.\nSo, I brought our friends and family together because, well, I want you to feel pressured.\nAnd because your answer means too much to me to leave any wiggle room.\nFortunately, we only have to do this part once.\nI ask, you answer.\nBut something's wrong.\nYour hand is naked.\n- [MAN] Here you go.\n- Thanks, man.\nIt's all right, the stone's conflict-free.\n[BOTH CHUCKLE] What do you say, Trish Walker? I'm asking you to marry me.\n[STAMMERS] Thank you.\n[GUESTS CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] Hi.\n[MAN 1] Hey, Griffin, so happy for you, mate.\n- [MAN 2] Congratulations.\n- [MAN 3] You really surprised her.\n[WOMAN] We're so happy for you.\n- Great to see you.\n- Oh, hi! - Congratulations! - [TRISH] Thank you! How was jail? How does that plant taste? Keep talking if you wanna find out.\nHey, thanks for the heads-up.\nAfter that tabloid stunt, can you blame me? I can keep a secret.\nSo can you, apparently.\nHey, took some sneaking around, hacking into her computer for her contacts, but she's worth it.\nHey! [GRIFFIN] Hey.\nHey, Jess.\nAll I want is to make Trish happy.\nI hope you can let that happen, at least today.\nThanks for coming.\n- [TRISH] Jess.\n- Hey.\nWhen did you get out? Are you okay? It's okay.\nDon't worry about it.\nJust go, enjoy this.\nI'm happy for you.\n[CHUCKLES] \"Thank you\" means yes, right? [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] I'm sorry, uh I'm a mess.\nUm Can we go somewhere and talk? - Sure.\n- Okay.\nYou work for Jessica.\nI'm her associate.\nMalcolm Ducasse.\nI didn't realize that Jessica had associates.\nWell, I just got promoted.\nUh This is Inez.\nPlease come in.\nHell of an upgrade from the last armpit I was staying in.\nJust keep an eye on your TV.\nYou take care of yourself, Inez.\nYou're the worst kind of person.\nYou pretend to care.\nBut you're not about helping anybody.\nExcept yourself.\nSounds like Jessica's people skills are rubbing off on you.\nThat's a good thing.\nI don't pay her to be popular.\nNice to meet you, Malcolm Ducasse.\n- [KNOCK ON DOOR] - [SPANISH MUSIC PLAYING] - [OSCAR IN SPANISH] Is someone there? - The door, Vido.\n[VIDO] Yes, Grandma.\n[DOOR OPENS] - Hey, Super Lady.\nCome in.\n[IN SPANISH] Who's there, Vido? - Ah.\nHello.\nHow are you? - Hello.\nSo this is the girl.\nCan she stay for dinner, Grandma? stay for dinner? Please? [IN SPANISH] If it's all right with your papi.\nlove if she stayed for dinner.\nAll right, calm down.\n[GRANDMA] Oye.\n- Hey.\n- Hey.\nfriend is very pretty.\nSorry, they came with the apartment.\nI can't get rid of them.\n[JESSICA] They're cute, in an obnoxious way.\n[CHUCKLES] This should get you where you need to go.\nI appreciate it.\n- I should go.\n- Want to stay for dinner? My mom makes a mean ropa vieja.\n- I can smell that.\nBut I gotta work.\n- What work? It's late.\nI think and I drink.\nIt's a whole process.\nWell, let me get you started.\nSpa\u00c3\u00b1ada? It's like sangria.\nMama's favorite.\nGets better after the third glass.\nIt's actually the first thing I got drunk on.\nMy parents used to keep it around the house.\nMy first was rum.\nKilled mojitos for me.\nI gotta go.\nGood luck.\n- Bye, Super Lady! - Come on.\n[IN SPANISH] Let's eat.\n- Grandma, sit.\nLet's eat.\n- Yes, yes.\n[VIDO] I'm very hungry.\n[OSCAR] Hungry, hungry, hungry.\nRice.\nOkay.\nBlack beans.\nLet's go.\nDo not put too much food on your plate.\nCoffee? How did you sleep? That bed's ridiculous.\nWhat are those sheets even made out of? Egyptian cotton.\nVery generous thread count.\nWould you like some breakfast? Sure.\n- But can I ask you something? - Of course.\nWould you cut the crap? A woman like you, with awards and all that, you don't just invite in some stranger off the streets, give the royal treatment.\nI have an agreement with Jessica to keep you safe.\nWell, there are plenty of places to keep me safe.\nWhy dirty your fancy sheets? Tell me what you want from me.\nReally.\nOr I'm leaving.\nI want to know everything that you know about IGH.\nSpecifically, about the experiments.\n[DOOR BUZZES] ID.\n[BUZZING] Hold up a minute.\nNew coat.\nLooks good.\nSomeone got blood on my last one.\n[MAN CRYING] [BANGING ON GATE] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [DOOR BUZZES] [DOOR BUZZES] Wait here.\nHe's ready.\nYou can start.\nI'll be fine in here alone with him.\nIt helps me establish trust.\nWe'll be right outside this door.\n[DOOR BUZZES] [DAVE] Hello.\nHello, Mr.\nKawecki.\nDo you prefer David? Dave? Well, hello, Dave, I'm your new therapist.\nAnd you can call me Anne.\n[DAVE] It's 10:30.\nThat's recreation time.\n[JESSICA] Is it okay to talk while you work on your picture? Well, for our first session, I'd like for you to tell me why you're here.\n[DAVE] That was all a long time ago.\n[JESSICA] I know, but it's very important for your therapy.\nWhy don't you start by telling me about Luanne? [DAVE] She was pretty.\nAnd she was nice to me.\nShe was the reason I liked going to work every day.\n- And where did you work? - At a hospital.\nI emptied trash cans, I cleaned the floors.\nAnd do you remember anyone else who worked there? Besides Luanne? I I forget things.\n[JESSICA] Were you and Luanne friends? I wanted her to be my girlfriend.\n[CHUCKLES] But she said it couldn't be like that.\nAnd what happened after that? One night, I took Luanne home, and I held her.\nShe started to scream, and I got angry.\nSo I held her tighter.\nAnd the next thing I know, Luanne's in the bathtub and she isn't screaming anymore.\nThat's quite a story.\nAre you sure that's what happened? I took Luanne home, and I held her I heard you.\nI just don't believe you.\nHow did you get Luanne back to your apartment? She just came with me, I guess.\n- You guess? - [STAMMERS] I mean, that's what happened.\nYou held her and the next thing you remember, she was dead? So you don't remember killing her? I don't know.\nI told you, I forget things.\nYou saw the life leave her eyes.\nThat is hard to forget, Dave, believe me.\n- I don't want to talk about this.\n- Because it's not true, is it? I think you're protecting someone.\n- Is it someone in your family? - My family's dead.\nWhoever it is, they're letting you rot in here, while Luanne's murderer is out there, hurting people.\nNo! You can still help Luanne, Dave.\nTell me who killed her.\nI did! I killed her! Why don't you believe me? [PANTING] [SIGHS] It's okay, Dave.\nI believe you.\nOkay? I believe you.\nIt's okay.\n[SIGHS] Hey, are octopuses your favorite animal? Did you know octopuses have no bones? A 600-pound octopus can fit through a hole the size of a quarter.\nAnd you know what it's like to be a big guy in a small space, right? Octopuses like to live alone, too, like me.\nThey don't even raise their babies.\nDid you know that no other DNA is like an octopus'? Their DNA? Are you sure? No one knows where their genes come from.\nThey're called de novo, which means \"out of nowhere.\n\" And how do you know so much about octopus genes? My friend Dr.\nKarl told me.\nAnd does Dr.\nKarl like octopuses, too? [LAUGHS] Yeah.\nHe likes them so much, he'd eat lunch at the aquarium every day.\nI used to go with him sometimes.\nWe'd sit by the octopus tank, and he'd share his sandwich with me, and he'd tell me all kinds of things.\nDid Dr.\nKarl also tell you that you killed Luanne? I don't want to talk about Dr.\nKarl anymore.\nWould you draw a picture for me? Of you and Dr.\nKarl watching the octopuses together? [DOOR OPENS] [DOROTHY] Pats, are you here? I just spoke with Griffin.\nShould've known you'd find some way to mess this up.\nI didn't mess anything up, Mother.\nThis is what I want.\nYou don't know what you want.\nYou're a different person on drugs.\nI'm stone cold sober.\nCall him.\nMaybe he'll take you back if you plead insanity.\n[SIGHS] I don't want him back.\nI knew it as soon as I got to the roof.\n- That proposal was breathtaking.\n- It was heartbreaking.\nBecause the moment I figured out what it was, that it wasn't a meeting with ZCN, all I could feel was disappointment.\n- Oh, Jesus - That's why I said no.\nListen, baby, you gotta listen to me.\nYou are making a huge mistake.\nI don't want to be with Griffin.\nI want to be him.\nI want to do what he does.\nAnd that's not love, and it's not fair to either one of us.\nYou know what I see? I see a spoiled, arrogant little girl.\nI'm arrogant? After everything I went through with your father - Oh, God.\n- And you finally find a good man, - a goddamn hero - Don't you dare bring Dad into this! Why not? He's the reason you always dated losers.\nThat is bullshit.\nAnd when you finally find a winner, you crawl back to Max and blow him for some story [GASPS] Mother, wait [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] [SNIFFLES] [INHALING] - [CELL PHONE RINGING] - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Detective Costa.\nHey, Jones here.\n[COSTA] You got something? [JESSICA] Well, I know who didn't kill Luanne McClure.\nIs that supposed to be helpful? She was a nurse, killed ten years ago.\nA guy named Dave Kawecki is locked up for it.\nBut? You can add her to our killer's body count.\nHow do you know this? I'm just helpfully telling you what I can confirm.\n[LINE DISCONNECTS] [JESSICA] Fun fact.\nWhen an octopus is attacked, it ditches its wounded arm and just swims away.\nIt's better to let things go before they drag you under.\n[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [JESSICA] The killer and I are like two solitary animals circling each other in a tank.\nTwo creatures, out of nowhere, unconnected to anything de novo.\nJessica, you're all right.\n[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [KARL] My lady You get lost? - [WOMAN] I didn't know where you were.\n- Stay close.\n[WOMAN] I was worried.\n[KARL] Excuse me.\n[CHUCKLING] Jessica [ALARM RINGING] [MAN OVER PA] Please exit the aquarium immediately [CLAMORING] Please exit the aquarium immediately [GRUNTS] Please exit the aquarium immediately [MAN] Help us!

love has no beginning, my love has no end\nNo front no back, my love won't bend\nI'm in the middle, I'm lost in a spin\nLoving you\nAnd you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know\nHow glad I am\nMy love has no bottom, my love has no top\nMy love won't rise, my love won't drop\nI'm in the middle, and I can't stop\nLoving you\nAnd you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know\nHow glad I am\nI wish I was a poet, so that I could express\nWhat I, what I like to say\nI wish I was an artist, so that I could paint a picture\nOf how I feel, how I feel today, today\nMy love has no walls on either side\nThat makes my love whiter than white\nI'm in the middle, no and I can't hide\nLoving you\nAnd you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't

hostility. 24 minor cultural items I\u2019m bored with, tired of, and pissed at. So i hope you\u2019re ready for a little random anger:\n\nPeople\u2026 people\u2026 PEOPLE who make quote marks in the air with their fingers. Are you tired of these people yet? He said he was \u201cSober\u201d. hey lady, \u201cEAT ME\u201d!\n\nBudda-boom budda-bing. The next guy who says to me \u201cbudda-boom budda-bing\u201d is getting kicked right in the fucking nuts. Budda-boom mother-fucker! You want to try budda-bing?\n\nBad hair day. Where did this shit come from? What a superficial culture. Put on a hat and go to work you shallow cunt. It\u2019s a good thing Lewis and Clark never had a bad hair day, or Daniel Boone huh? Custer? He had a REALLY bad hair day. But he had it coming, that blond, blue-eyed, criminal fuck\n\nWhat about these guys that tell you: \u201cI heard that\u2026\u201d, \u201cI heard that\u2026\u201d, oh you did did you? Well isn\u2019t this exciting\u2026 what is this, a fucking hearing test? Did I wonder into a beltone commercial here? Of course you \u201cheard\u201d you fucking nimrod. I\u2019m standing right next to ya\u2026 I\u2019m going to move down here\u2026 I\u2019m going to move a little farther away\u2026 BLOW ME! by any chance did you hear that?\nWhat about these people who tell you their needs aren\u2019t being met? You run into this stuff? this is support-group shit, twelve-steppers. \u201cmy needs aren\u2019t being met\u201d. Know what i tell them? \u201cDROP SOME OF YOUR NEEDS\u201d. Life is a zero-sum game\nWhat else is troubling me? Mickey Mouse\u2019s birthday being announced on the television news as if it\u2019s an actual event!  I don\u2019t give a shit! if i cared about Mickey Mouse\u2019s birthday, I\u2019d have memorized it years ago, and I\u2019d send him a card: \u201cDear Mickey, Happy Birthday, love George\u201d. I don\u2019t do that, why?  I don\u2019t give a shit!  Fuck Mickey Mouse!  Fuck him in the asshole with a big rubber dick, then break it off and beat him with the rest of it. I hope mickey dies.  I do, I hope he god-damn dies. I hope he gets a hold of some tainted cheese, and dies lonely and forgotten, behind the baseboard of a soiled bathroom, in a poor neighborhood, with his hand in Goofy\u2019s pants. Mickey Mouse \u2013 no wonder no one in the world takes our country seriously.  We're wasting valuable television-time, informing our citizens of the age of an imaginary rodent!\n\nNow let me ask you this: the two pandas in the zoo, do you care if they fuck? I don\u2019t. why don\u2019t they stop telling me on the news \u201cthe pandas didn\u2019t fuck again this year\u201d. I\u2019m not concerned!  I have no emotional stake in panda fucking, all right? If they want to, they will.  If not, they\u2019ll watch the Price is Right!  Probably the only reason they\u2019re not doing it on time is \u2019cause some jack-off from the environmental movement has moved into the cage with them. Could you get a hard-on if some guy in a green t-shirt with a stopwatch was taking your girlfriend\u2019s rectal temperature? leave these creatures alone!\n\nAnd as long as were talking about the news, i don\u2019t want to hear anything more about sperm-egg donor, surrogate, in vetro, test-tube, biological, adoptive foster parents who want their baby back. Baby Jane, Baby Ruth, Baby this, Baby that, Baby it\u2019s cold outside, I don\u2019t give a shit! Leave me alone and keep it off my TV! Sick American shit!\n\nI\u2019m also tired of hearing about \u201cinnocent victims\u201d. This is an outmoded idea. There are no \u201cinnocent victims\u201d. If you live on this planet, you\u2019re guilty. Period. Fuck you. End of report, next case. NEXT FUCKING CASE! Next case! Your birth certificate is proof of guilt\n\nAnd what happened in this country that now suddenly everyone is walking around with their own personal bottle of water? When did we get so thirsty in America? Is everybody so dehydrated they have to have their own portable supply of fluids with them at all times? Get a drink before you leave the house!\n\nAnother crime against society: hyphenated names. Hey lady, pick a fucking name would you please?  Pick a fucking name. \u201cHi I\u2019m Emily Jericho-Fordescu\u201d. Hi I\u2019m George jerk-me-off-fuck-you-too. You don\u2019t acquire personal dignity by adding a name to your name.  Feminists think it\u2019s a \u201cradical act\u201d.  It\u2019s not.  Castrating a guy in a parking lot with a coke bottle is a radical act. Hyphenating your name is pretentious bullshit\n\nAnd what is going on with all these telephone-calling plans? MCI, AT&T, is this shit really necessary? When did the phone bill become life\u2019s most critical document? In a country where you can buy cinnamon dental floss, cheese in a spray can, and eatable women\u2019s panties, are people really breaking their balls to save nine cents on a fucking phone call? Talking to your mother once a year might not be the most pleasant thing in the world, but it should not be seen as a critical spending decision\n\nSomething else I don\u2019t understand: motivation tapes. Motivation books. What happened here? Suddenly everybody needs to be motivated? It\u2019s a fairly simple thing. Either you want to do something or you don\u2019t. What\u2019s the big mystery? Besides, if you\u2019re motivated enough to go the store to buy a motivation book, aren\u2019t you motivated enough to do that so you don\u2019t need the book? Put it back. Tell the clerk \u201cfuck you\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m motivated\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m going home\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m going home\u201d\n\nAnd can anyone explain to me the need for one-hour photo-finishing? You just saw the fucking thing, how can you possibly be nostalgic about a concept like a little while ago?\n\nAnother complaint: too many vehicles. There are some families in this country who own entirely too many vehicles. You see them on the highway in an rv but that\u2019s not enough for them. The rv\u2019s not enough. Behind them they\u2019re towing a motorboat, go-cart, dune-buggy, dirt-bike, jet-ski, snowmobile, para-sail, hang-glider, windsurfing equipment, a hot air balloon, and a small two-man deep-sea diving-bell. Doesn\u2019t anyone just take a fucking walk anymore? The only thing these people lack is a lunar excursion module. Too many choices America. It\u2019s not healthy!\n\nAnother abomination: white guys over ten years of age who wear their baseball hats backwards. Listen to me white guys. Let me tell you something. You\u2019re never going to be as cool as black guys, it\u2019s not going to happen\u2026 You\u2019re white, and you\u2019re lame. It\u2019s a fucking law of nature. Turning your hat around and learning a complicated handshake will not make you cool. And you black guys, since you started the whole thing, I\u2019m going to let you stay with the hats a little bit longer, but i think really, once you qualify for social security it\u2019s time to spin that motherfucker around to the front of you!\n\nAnother tip. Another tip for the men: The earring. The thing with the earrings. It\u2019s over. It\u2019s been over for a long time. Doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore. It was supposed to piss off the squares. The squares are wearing them now! Doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s just fucking jewelry, unless you have an earring with a live baby hanging from it. It\u2019s just jewelry. And I want you to know I\u2019m in favor of self-mutilation and personal disfigurement. I\u2019ve always said there\u2019s nothing like puncturing and perforating your skin in a dozen or so places in order to demonstrate your high self-esteem. When i see a young man decorating his scalp with a soldering iron I say: there\u2019s a happy guy! Thinks highly of himself\n\nAnd haven\u2019t we gone a little over-board with these colored ribbons for different causes? Every cause has it\u2019s own colored ribbon now. Red for aids. Blue for child-abuse. Pink for breast cancer. Green for the rain forest. Purple for urban violence. I got a brown one. You know what it means? EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKER! EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKER!\nYou might also likeAnd what can we do to silence these christian athletes, who thank Jesus whenever they win, never mention his name when they lose, not a word. You never hear them say: \u201cJesus made me drop the ball, the Good Lord tripped me up behind the line of scrimmage\u201d. According to these guys Jesus is undefeated. Meanwhile these assholes are in last place. Must be another one of those \u201cmiracles\u201d\nAnd speaking of delusional people, what about a guy who hears a voice in his head which tells him to kill his entire family, so he does it. Is this the only thing a voice in the head ever tells these people to do, is to kill others? Doesn\u2019t a voice ever tell a guy: \u201cgo take a shit on the salad bar at wendy\u2019s\u201d. Doesn\u2019t a voice\u2026 doesn\u2019t a voice tell a guy to take out his dick on the merry-go-round once in a while? Well some guys do take out their dicks on the merry-go-round, but usually it\u2019s their own idea\n\nSomething else I can do without: after-shave and cologne, and this disgusting shit that men put on their bodies. Just what I need in the elevator, some guy standing next to me smells like a fucking pine tree. I say go home and wash you smelly prick. You smell like the urinal in a Portuguese cat-house. God-damn guys are stupid. Guys are really fucking dumb. They think they\u2019re going to get laid with this stuff you know. Oh yeah, they put it on at home thinking: oh boy, oh boy, I\u2019ll get laid tonight. I\u2019ll get laid tonight. You don\u2019t get laid with green shit that comes out of a bottle okay? The only smell that\u2019s going to help you get laid might be your own natural scent. You have pheromones. It\u2019s a secondary sex characteristic. people in America, they\u2019re all nervous about sex. They want to cover it up and disguise it. Guys in Europe, they know how to live. Guy gets in an elevator over there, he smells like a pile of dog shit, those people are sophisticated!\n\nGetting pretty tired of these guys walking around in cowboy hats and cowboy boots. You ever see these jack-offs? Can\u2019t we kill some of these motherfuckers? Walking around in a fucking cowboy hat. Grown men. It\u2019s not even Halloween for christ-sakes. I say \u201chey Tex grow up and get yourself a wardrobe consistent with the century you\u2019re living in\u201d. Why do certain men feel the need to dress up as mythic figures? You don\u2019t see anyone walking around in a pirate costume do you? When was the last guy you ran into who had on a viking outfit? Make-believe cowboys\u2026 the closest they ever got to a cow is when they stopped to take a piss at an Arby\u2019s\n\nAnd cam-corders: here is technology gone bezerk. Everywhere you go now, there\u2019s some dick, some yo-yo, some putz, with a cam-corder. And he is going to tape everything. Doesn\u2019t anyone in this country just stop and look at things anymore? Sort of take them in, maybe even remember them? Is that such a strange notion? Does experience have to be documented, and brought home, and saved on the shelf? And do people really watch this shit? Are people\u2019s lives so bankrupt, they sit at home looking at things they already did? And these guys are so intense you know. It\u2019s always guys, they won\u2019t let women touch the cameras because it\u2019s a \"highly technical skill\". Look for a hole. Push on a button. Big skill. And they all think they\u2019re Federico Fellini. Low-angles, zooms and pans, and it\u2019s the same ugly three children in every god-damn shot. All the George Lucas magic in Hollywood is not going to change the unfortunate genetic configuration on the faces of these children. Keep these unfortunate youngsters out of public view!\n\nNow a lot of these cultural crimes I\u2019ve been complaining about can be blamed on the baby-boomers. Something else I\u2019m a little tired of hearing about, the baby-boomers. Whiney, narcissistic, self-indulgent people, with a simple philosophy: \u201cgimme-it it\u2019s mine\u201d! \u201cgive-me-that it\u2019s mine\u201d! These people were given everything. Everything was handed to them, and they took it all. Took it all. Sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll. And they stayed loaded for twenty years, and had a free ride, but now they\u2019re staring down the barrel of middle-age burn-out, and they don\u2019t like it. They don\u2019t like it so they\u2019ve turned self-righteous, and they want to make things hard on younger people. They tell them to: \u201cabstain\u201d from sex. \u201cSay no\u201d to drugs. As for the rock-n-roll, they sold that for television commercials a long time ago, so they could buy pasta-machines, and \u201cstair-masters\u201d, and \u201csoybean-futures\u201d. \u201cSoybean-futures\u201d. You know something? They\u2019re cold bloodless people. It\u2019s in their slogans. It\u2019s in their rhetoric. \u201cNo pain no gain\u201d, \u201cjust do it\u201d, \u201clife is short play hard\u201d, \u201cshit happens deal with it\u201d, \u201cget a life\u201d. These people went from \u201cdo your own thing\u201d to \u201cjust say no\u201d. They went from \u201clove is all you need\u201d to \u201cwhoever winds up with the most toys wins\u201d. And they went from cocaine to rogaine. And you know something? They\u2019re still counting grams, only now it\u2019s fat grams. And the worst of it is, the rest of us have to watch these commercials on TV for Levi\u2019s loose-fitting jeans, and fat-ass docker pants, because these degenerate yuppie-boomer-cocksuckers couldn\u2019t keep their hands off the croissants, and the h\u00e4agen-dazs. And their big fat asses have spread all over and they have to wear fat-ass docker pants. Fuck these boomers. Fuck these yuppies. And fuck everybody now that I think about of it\n\nWell sometimes in comedy, you have to generalize\n\nNow there\u2019s one thing you might have noticed i don\u2019t complain about: politicians. everybody complains about politicians. Everybody says they suck. Well where do people think these politicians come from? They don\u2019t fall out of the sky. They don\u2019t pass through a membrane from \u201canother reality\u201d. They come from American parents, and American families, American homes, American schools, American churches, American businesses, and American universities. And they\u2019re elected by American citizens. This is the best we can do folks. This is what we have to offer. It\u2019s what our system produces: Garbage in. Garbage out. If you have selfish ignorant citizens\u2026 If you have selfish ignorant citizens, you\u2019re going to get selfish ignorant leaders. And term-limits ain\u2019t going to do you any good. You\u2019re just going to wind up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans. So maybe\u2026 maybe\u2026 MAYBE, it\u2019s not the politicians who suck. Maybe something else sucks around here like: \u201cTHE PUBLIC\u201d. Yeah the public sucks. There\u2019s a nice campaign slogan for somebody: \u201cthe public sucks, fuck hope\u201d. Fuck hope. Because if it\u2019s really just the fault of these politicians, then where are all the other bright people of conscience? Where are all the bright, honest, intelligent Americans ready to step in and save the nation and lead the way? We don\u2019t have people like that in this country. Everybody\u2019s at the mall! Scratching his ass, picking his nose, taking out his credit card out of a fannie-pack, and buying a pair of sneakers with lights in them!\n\nSo I have solved this little political dilemma for myself in a very simple way: on election-day, I-STAY-HOME. I don\u2019t vote. Fuck \u2019em. FUCK THEM. I don\u2019t vote. Two reasons. Two reasons I don\u2019t vote: first of all, it\u2019s meaningless. This country was bought and sold and paid for a long time ago. The shit they shuffle around every four years doesn\u2019t mean a fuckin\u2019 thing. And secondly, I don\u2019t vote \u2019cause I believe if you vote, you have no right to complain. People like to twist that around. I know, they say, they say: \u201cwell if you don\u2019t vote you have no right to complain\u201d. But where\u2019s the logic in that? If you vote, and you elect dishonest, incompetent people, and they get into office and screw everything up, well you are responsible for what they have done, YOU caused the problem, you voted them in, you have no right to complain. I on the other hand, who did not vote, WHO DID NOT VOTE. Who in fact did not even leave the house on election-day, am in no way responsible for what these people have done, and have every RIGHT to complain as loud as I want, about the mess YOU created, that I had nothing to do with. So I know that a little later on this year, you\u2019re going to have another one of those really swell presidential elections that you like so much. You enjoy yourselves. It will be a lot of fun. I\u2019m sure as soon as the election is over, your country will \u201cimprove\u201d immediately. As for me, I\u2019ll be home on that day, doing essentially the same thing as you, the only difference is, when I get finished masturbating, I\u2019m going to have a little something to show for it folks!\n\nThank you very much. thank you very much.

For instance, did you know that some modern dictionaries are notoriously liberal and others notoriously conservative, and that certain conservative dictionaries were actually conceived and designed as corrective responses to the \"corruption\" and \"permissiveness\" of certain liberal dictionaries? That the oligarchic device of having a special \"Distinguished Usage Panel ... of outstanding professional speakers and writers\" is an attempted compromise between the forces of egalitarianism and traditionalism in English, but that most linguistic liberals dismiss the Usage Panel as mere sham-populism? Did you know that U.S. lexicography even had a seamy underbelly?\n\nThe occasion for this article is Oxford University Press's semi-recent release of Bryan A. Garner's A Dictionary of Modern American Usage. The fact of the matter is that Garner's dictionary is extremely good, certainly the most comprehensive usage guide since E. W. Gilman's Webster's Dictionary of English Usage, now a decade out of date.[1] Its format, like that of Gilman and the handful of other great American usage guides of the last century, includes entries on individual words and phrases and expostulative small-cap MINI-ESSAYS. on any issue broad enough to warrant more general discussion. But the really distinctive and ingenious features of A Dictionary of Modern American Usage involve issues of rhetoric and ideology and style, and it is impossible to describe why these issues are important and why Garner's management of them borders on genius without talking about the historical contexts [2] in which ADMAU appears, and this context turns out to be a veritable hurricane of controversies involving everything from technical linguistics to public education to political ideology, and these controversies take a certain amount of time to unpack before their relation to what makes Garner's usage guide so eminently worth your hard-earned reference-book dollar can even be established; and in fact there's no way even to begin the whole harrowing polymeric discussion without taking a moment to establish and define the highly colloquial term SNOOT.\n\nFrom one perspective, a certain irony attends the publication of any good new book on American usage. It is that the people who are going to be interested in such a book are also the people who are least going to need it, i.e., that offering counsel on the finer points of U.S. English is Preaching to the Choir. The relevant Choir here comprises that small percentage of American citizens who actually care about the current status of double modals and ergative verbs. The same sorts of people who watched Story of English on PBS (twice) and read W. Safire's column with their half-caff every Sunday. The sorts of people who feel that special blend of wincing despair and sneering superiority when they see EXPRESS LANE \u2014 10 ITEMS OR LESS or hear dialogue used as a verb or realize that the founders of the Super 8 motel chain must surely have been ignorant of the meaning of suppurate. There are lots of epithets for people like this \u2014 Grammar Nazis, Usage Nerds, Syntax Snobs, the Language Police. The term I was raised with is SNOOT.[3] The word might be slightly self-mocking, but those other terms are outright dysphemisms. A SNOOT can be defined as somebody who knows what dysphemism means and doesn't mind letting you know it.\n\nI submit that we SNOOTs are just about the last remaining kind of truly elitist nerd. There are, granted, plenty of nerd-species in today's America, and some of these are elitist within their own nerdy purview (e.g., the skinny, carbuncular, semi-autistic Computer Nerd moves instantly up on the totem pole of status when your screen freezes and now you need his help, and the bland condescension with which he performs the two occult keystrokes that unfreeze your screen is both elitist and situationally valid). But the SNOOT's purview is interhuman social life itself. You don't, after all (despite withering cultural pressure), have to use a computer, but you can't escape language: Language is everything and everywhere; it's what lets us have anything to do with one another; it's what separates us from the animals; Genesis 11:7-10 and so on. And we SNOOTS know when and how to hyphenate phrasal adjectives and to keep participles from dangling, and we know that we know, and we know how very few other Americans know this stuff or even care, and we judge them accordingly.\n\nIn ways that certain of us are uncomfortable about, SNOOTs' attitudes about contemporary usage resemble religious/political conservatives' attitudes about contemporary culture:[4] We combine a missionary zeal and a near-neural faith in our beliefs' importance with a curmudgeonly hell-in-a-handbasket despair at the way English is routinely manhandled and corrupted by supposedly educated people. The Evil is all around us: boners and clunkers and solecistic howlers and bursts of voguish linguistic methane that make any SNOOT's cheek twitch and forehead darken. A fellow SNOOT I know likes to say that listening to most people's English feels like watching somebody use a Stradivarius to pound nails. We[5] are the Few, the Proud, the Appalled at Everyone Else.\nTHESIS STATEMENT FOR WHOLE ARTICLE\n\nIssues of tradition vs. egalitarianism in U.S. English are at root political issues and can be effectively addressed only in what this article hereby terms a \"Democratic Spirit.\" A Democratic Spirit is one that combines rigor and humility, i.e., passionate conviction plus sedulous respect for the convictions of others. As any American knows, this is a very difficult spirit to cultivate and maintain, particularly when it comes to issues you feel strongly about. Equally tough is a D.S.'s criterion of 100 percent intellectual integrity \u2014 you have to be willing to look honestly at yourself and your motives for believing what you believe, and to do it more or less continually.\n\nThis kind of stuff is advanced U.S. citizenship. A true Democratic Spirit is up there with religious faith and emotional maturity and all those other top-of-the-Maslow-Pyramid-type qualities people spend their whole lives working on. A Democratic Spirit's constituent rigor and humility and honesty are in fact so hard to maintain on certain issues that it's almost irresistibly tempting to fall in with some established dogmatic camp and to follow that camp's line on the issue and to let your position harden within the camp and become inflexible and to believe that any other camp is either evil or insane and to spend all your time and energy trying to shout over them.\n\nI submit, then, that it is indisputably easier to be dogmatic than Democratic, especially about issues that are both vexed and highly charged. I submit further that the issues surrounding \"correctness\" in contemporary American usage are both vexed and highly charged, and that the fundamental questions they involve are ones whose answers have to be \"worked out\" instead of simply found.\n\nA distinctive feature of ADMAU is that its author is willing to acknowledge that a usage dictionary is not a bible or even a textbook but rather just the record of one smart person's attempts to work out answers to certain very difficult questions. This willingness appears to me to be informed by a Democratic Spirit. The big question is whether such a spirit compromises Garner's ability to present himself as a genuine \"authority\" on issues of usage. Assessing Garner's book, then, involves trying to trace out the very weird and complicated relationship between Authority and Democracy in what we as a culture have decided is English. That relationship is, as many educated Americans would say, still in process at this time.\n\nA Dictionary of Modern American Usage has no Editorial Staff or Distinguished Panel. It's conceived, researched, and written ab ovo usque ad mala by Bryan Garner. This is an interesting guy. He's both a lawyer and a lexicographer (which seems a bit like being both a narcotics dealer and a DEA agent). His 1987 A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage is already a minor classic; now, instead of practicing law anymore, he goes around conducting writing seminars for J.D.'s and doing prose-consulting for various judicial bodies. Garner's also the founder of something called the H. W. Fowler Society,[6] a worldwide group of usage-Trekkies who like to send one another linguistic boners clipped from different periodicals. You get the idea. This Garner is one serious and very hard-core SNOOT.\n\nThe lucid, engaging, and extremely sneaky Preface to ADMAU serves to confirm Garner's SNOOTitude in fact while undercutting it in tone. For one thing, whereas the traditional usage pundit cultivates a sort of remote and imperial persona \u2014 the kind who uses one or we to refer to himself \u2014 Garner gives us an almost Waltonishly endearing sketch of his own background:\n\nI realized early at the age of 15[7] \u2014 that my primary\nintellectual interest was the use of the English language....\nIt became an all-consuming passion.... I read everything\nI could find on the subject. Then, on a wintry evening\nwhile visiting New Mexico at the age of 16, I discovered\nEric Partridge's Usage and Abusage. I was enthralled.\nNever had I held a more exciting book.... Suffice it\nto say that by the time I was 18, I had committed to\nmemory most of Fowler, Partridge, and their successors....\n\nAlthough this reviewer regrets the biosketch's failure to mention the rather significant social costs of being an adolescent whose overriding passion is English usage,[8] the critical hat is off to yet another personable section of the Preface, one that Garner entitles \"First Principles\": \"Before going any further, I should explain my approach. That's an unusual thing for the author of a usage dictionary to do \u2014 unprecedented, as far as I know. But a guide to good writing is only as good as the principles on which it's based. And users should be naturally interested in those principles. So, in the interests of full disclosure ...\"[9]\nThe \"unprecedented\" and \"full disclosure\" here are actually good-natured digs at Garner's Fowlerite predecessors, and a subtle nod to one camp in the wars that have raged in both lexicography and education ever since the notoriously liberal Webster's Third New International Dictionary came out in 1961 and included such terms as heighth and irregardless without any monitory labels on them. You can think of Webster's Third as sort of the Fort Sumter of the contemporary Usage Wars. These Wars are both the context and the target of a very subtle rhetorical strategy in A Dictionary of Modern American Usage, and without talking about them it's impossible to explain why Garner's book is both so good and so sneaky.\n\nWe regular citizens tend to go to The Dictionary for authoritative guidance.[10] Rarely, however, do we ask ourselves who decides what gets in The Dictionary or what words or spellings or pronunciations get deemed \"substandard\" or \"incorrect.\" Whence the authority of dictionary-makers to decide what's OK[11] and what isn't? Nobody elected them, after all. And simply appealing to precedent or tradition won't work, because what's considered correct changes over time. In the 1600s, for instance, the second-singular pronoun took a singular conjugation \u2014 \"You is.\" Earlier still, the standard 2-S pronoun wasn't \"you\" but \"thou\". Huge numbers of now acceptable words like clever, fun, banter, and prestigious entered English as what usage authorities considered errors or egregious slang. And not just usage conventions but English itself changes over time; if it didn't, we'd all still be talking like Chaucer. Who's to say which changes are natural and which are corruptions? And when Bryan Garner or E. Ward Gilman do in fact presume to say, why should we believe them?\n\nThese sorts of questions are not new, but they do now have a certain urgency. America is in the midst of a protracted Crisis of Authority in matters of language. In brief, the same sorts of political upheavals that produced everything from Kent State to Independent Counsels have produced an influential contra-SNOOT school for whom normative standards of English grammar and usage are functions of nothing but custom and superstition and the ovine docility of a populace that lets self-appointed language authorities boss them around. See for example MIT's Steven Pinker in a famous New Republic article \u2014 \"Once introduced, a prescriptive rule is very hard to eradicate, no matter how ridiculous. Inside the writing establishment, the rules survive by the same dynamic that perpetuates ritual genital mutilations\" \u2014 or, at a somewhat lower pitch, Bill Bryson in Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way:\n\nWho sets down all those rules that we all know\nabout from childhood: the idea that we must never\nend a sentence with a preposition or begin one with\na conjunction, that we must use \"each other\" for two\nthings and \"one another\" for more than two ...? The\nanswer, surprisingly often, is that no one does,\nthat when you look into the background of these\n\"rules\" there is often little basis for them.\n\nIn ADMAU's Preface, Garner himself addresses the Authority Question with a Trumanesque simplicity and candor that simultaneously disguise the author's cunning and exemplify it:\n\nAs you might already suspect, I don't shy away\nfrom making judgments. I can't imagine that most\nreaders would want me to. Linguists don't like it,\nof course, because judgment involves subjectivity.[12]\nIt isn't scientific. But rhetoric and usage, in the view\nof most professional writers, aren't scientific endeavors.\nYou don't want dispassionate descriptions; you want\nsound guidance. And that requires judgment.\n\nWhole monographs could be written just on the masterful rhetoric of this passage. Note for example the ingenious equivocation of judgment in \"I don't shy away from making judgments\" vs. \"And that requires judgment.\" Suffice it to say that Garner is at all times keenly aware of the Authority Crisis in modern usage; and his response to this crisis is in the best Democratic Spirit rhetorical.\n\nSo ...\n\nCOROLLARY TO THESIS STATEMENT FOR WHOLE ARTICLE\n\nThe most salient and timely feature of Garner's book is that it's both lexicographical and rhetorical. Its main strategy involves what is known in classical rhetoric as the Ethical Appeal. Here the adjective, derived from the Greek ethos, doesn't mean quite what we usually mean by ethical. But there are affinities. What the Ethical Appeal amounts to is a complex and sophisticated \"Trust me.\" It's the boldest, most ambitious, and also most distinctively American of rhetorical Appeals, because it requires the rhetor to convince us not just of his intellectual acuity or technical competence but of his basic decency and fairness and sensitivity to the audience's own hopes and fears.[13]\n\nThese are not qualities one associates with the traditional SNOOT usage-authority, a figure who pretty much instantiates snobbishness and bow-tied anality, and one whose modern image is not improved by stuff like American Heritage Dictionary Distinguished Usage Panelist Morris Bishop's \"The arrant solecisms of the ignoramus are here often omitted entirely, `irregardless' of how he may feel about this neglect\" or critic John Simon's \"The English language is being treated nowadays exactly as slave traders once handled their merchandise....\" Compare those lines' authorial personas with Garner's in, e.g., \"English usage is so challenging that even experienced writers need guidance now and then.\"\n\nThe thrust here is going to be that A Dictionary of Modern American Usage earns Garner pretty much all the trust his Ethical Appeal asks us for. The book's \"feel-good\" spirit (in the very best sense of \"feel-good\") marries rigor and humility in such a way as to allow Garner to be extremely prescriptive without any appearance of evangelism or elitist putdown. This is an extraordinary accomplishment. Understanding why it's basically a rhetorical accomplishment, and why this is both historically significant and (in this reviewer's opinion) politically redemptive, requires a more detailed look at the Usage Wars.\n\nYou'd sure know lexicography had an underbelly if you read the little introductory essays in modern dictionaries \u2014 pieces like Webster's DEU's \"A Brief History of English Usage\" or Webster's Third's \"Linguistic Advances and Lexicography\" or AHD-3's \"Usage in the American Heritage Dictionary: The Place of Criticism.\" But almost nobody ever bothers with these little intros, and it's not just their six-point type or the fact that dictionaries tend to be hard on the lap. It's that these intros aren't actually written for you or me or the average citizen who goes to The Dictionary just to see how to spell (for instance) meringue. They're written for other lexicographers and critics, and in fact they're not really introductory at all but polemical. They're salvos in the Usage Wars that have been under way ever since editor Philip Gove first sought to apply the value-neutral principles of structural linguistics to lexicography in Webster's Third. Gove's famous response to conservatives who howled[14] when Webster's Third endorsed OK and described ain't as \"used orally in most parts of the U.S. by many cultivated speakers [sic]\" was this: \"A dictionary should have no traffic with ... artificial notions of correctness or superiority. It should be descriptive and not prescriptive.\" These terms stuck and turned epithetic, and linguistic conservatives are now formally known as Prescriptivists and linguistic liberals as Descriptivists.\n\nThe former are far better known. When you read the columns of William Safire or Morton Freeman or books like Edwin Newman's Strictly Speaking or John Simon's Paradigms Lost, you're actually reading Popular Prescriptivism, a genre sideline of certain journalists (mostly older ones, the vast majority of whom actually do wear bow ties) whose bemused irony often masks a Colonel Blimp's rage at the way the beloved English of their youth is being trashed in the decadent present. The plutocratic tone and styptic wit of Safire and Newman and the best of the Prescriptivists is often modeled after the mandarin-Brit personas of Eric Partridge and H. W. Fowler, the same Twin Towers of scholarly Prescriptivism whom Garner talks about revering as a kid.[15]\n\nDescriptivists, on the other hand, don't have weekly columns in the Times. These guys tend to be hard-core academics, mostly linguists or Comp theorists. Loosely organized under the banner of structural (or \"descriptive\") linguistics, they are doctrinaire positivists who have their intellectual roots in the work of Auguste Comte and Ferdinand de Saussure and their ideological roots firmly in the U.S. sixties. The brief explicit mention Garner's Preface gives this crew \u2014\n\nSomewhere along the line, though, usage dictionaries\ngot hijacked by the descriptive linguists.[16] who observe\nlanguage scientifically. For the pure descriptivist, it's\nimpermissible to say that one form of language is\nany better than another: as long as a native speaker\nsays it, it's OK \u2014 and anyone who takes a contrary\nstand is a dunderhead.... Essentially, descriptivists and\nprescriptivists are approaching different problems.\nDescriptivists want to record language as it's actually\nused, and they perform a useful function \u2014 though\ntheir audience is generally limited to those willing to pore\nthrough vast tomes of dry-as-dust research.\n\n\u2014 is disingenuous in the extreme, especially the \"approaching different problems\" part, because it vastly underplays the Descriptivists' influence on U.S. culture. For one thing, Descriptivism so quickly and thoroughly took over English education in this country that just about everybody who started junior high after c. 1970 has been taught to write Descriptively \u2014 via \"freewriting,\" \"brainstorming,\" \"journaling,\" a view of writing as self-exploratory and -expressive rather than as communicative, an abandonment of systematic grammar, usage, semantics, rhetoric, etymology. For another thing, the very language in which today's socialist, feminist, minority, gay, and environmentalist movements frame their sides of political debates is informed by the Descriptivist belief that traditional English is conceived and perpetuated by Privileged WASP Males[17] and is thus inherently capitalist, sexist, racist, xenophobic, homophobic, elitist: unfair. Think Ebonics. Think of the involved contortions people undergo to avoid he as a generic pronoun, or of the tense deliberate way white males now adjust their vocabularies around non-w.m.'s. Think of today's endless battles over just the names of things \u2014 \"Affirmative Action\" vs. \"Reverse Discrimination,\" \"Pro-Life\" vs. \"Pro-Choice,\" \"Undercount\" vs. \"Vote Fraud,\" etc.\n\nThe Descriptivist revolution takes a little time to unpack, but it's worth it. The structural linguists' rejection of conventional usage rules depends on two main arguments. The first is academic and methodological. In this age of technology, Descriptivists contend, it's the Scientific Method \u2014 clinically objective, value-neutral, based on direct observation and demonstrable hypothesis \u2014 that should determine both the content of dictionaries and the standards of \"correct\" English. Because language is constantly evolving, such standards will always be fluid. Gore's now classic introduction to Webster's Third outlines this type of Descriptivism's five basic edicts:\n\n\"1 \u2014 Language changes constantly;\n\n2 \u2014 Change is normal;\n\n3 \u2014 Spoken language is the language;\n\n4 \u2014 Correctness rests upon usage;\n\n5 \u2014 All usage is relative.\"\n\nThese principles look prima facie OK \u2014 commonsensical and couched in the bland simple s.-v.-o, prose of dispassionate Science \u2014 but in fact they're vague and muddled and it takes about three seconds to think of reasonable replies to each one of them, viz.:\n\n1 \u2014 OK, but how much and how fast?\n\n2 \u2014 Same thing. Is Heraclitean flux as normal or desirable as gradual change ? Do some changes actually serve the language's overall pizzazz better than others? And how many people have to deviate from how many conventions before we say the language has actually changed? Fifty percent? Ten percent?\n\n3 \u2014 This is an old claim, at least as old as Plato's Phaedrus. And it's specious. If Derrida and the infamous Deconstructionists have done nothing else, they've debunked the idea that speech is language's primary instantiation.[18] Plus consider the weird arrogance of Gove's (3) w/r/t correctness. Only the most mullahlike Prescriptivists care very much about spoken English; most Prescriptive usage guides concern Standard Written English.[19]\n\n4 \u2014 Fine, but whose usage? Gove's (4) begs the whole question. What he wants to imply here, I think, is a reversal of the traditional entailment-relation between abstract rules and concrete usage: Instead of usage ideally corresponding to a rigid set of regulations, the regulations ought to correspond to the way real people are actually using the language. Again, fine, but which people? Urban Latinos? Boston Brahmins? Rural Midwesterners? Appalachian Neogaelics?\n\n5 \u2014 Huh? If this means what it seems to mean, then it ends up biting Gove's whole argument in the ass. (5) appears to imply that the correct answer to the above \"which people?\" is: \"All of them!\" And it's easy to show why this will not stand up as a lexicographical principle. The most obvious problem with it is that not everything can go in The Dictionary. Why not? Because you can't observe every last bit of every last native speaker's \"language behavior,\" and even if you could, the resultant dictionary would weigh 4 million pounds and have to be updated hourly.[20] The fact is that any lexicographer is going to have to make choices about what gets in and what doesn't. And these choices are based on ... what? And now we're right back where we started.\n\nIt is true that, as a SNOOT, I am probably neurologically predisposed to look for flaws in Gove et al.'s methodological argument. But these flaws seem awfully easy to find. Probably the biggest one is that the Descriptivists' \"scientific lexicography\" \u2014 under which, keep in mind, the ideal English dictionary is basically number-crunching; you somehow observe every linguistic act by every native/naturalized speaker of English and put the sum of all these acts between two covers and call it The Dictionary \u2014 involves an incredibly simplistic and outdated understanding of what \"scientific\" means. It requires a naive belief in scientific objectivity, for one thing. Even in the physical sciences, everything from quantum mechanics to Information Theory has shown that an act of observation is itself part of the phenomenon observed and is analytically inseparable from it.\n\nIf you remember your old college English classes, there's an analogy here that points up the trouble scholars get into when they confuse observation with interpretation. Recall the New Critics.[21] They believed that literary criticism was best conceived as a \"scientific\" endeavor: The critic was a neutral, careful, unbiased, highly trained observer whose job was to find and objectively describe meanings that were right there \u2014 literally inside \u2014 pieces of literature. Whether you know what happened to the New Criticism's reputation depends on whether you took college English after c. 1975; suffice it to say that its star bas dimmed. The New Critics had the same basic problem as Gove's Methodological Descriptivists: They believed that scientific meant the same thing as neutral or unbiased. And that linguistic meanings could exist \"objectively,\" separate from any interpretive act.\n\nThe point of the analogy is that claims to objectivity in language study are now the stuff of jokes and shudders. The epistemological assumptions that underlie Methodological Descriptivism have been thoroughly debunked and displaced \u2014 n Lit by the rise of post-structuralism, Reader-Response Criticism, and Jaussian Reception Theory; in linguistics by the rise of Pragmatics \u2014 and it's now pretty much universally accepted that (a) meaning is inseparable from some act of interpretation and (b) an act of interpretation is always somewhat biased, i.e., informed by the interpreter's particular ideology. And the consequence of (a) and (b) is that there's no way around it \u2014 decisions about what to put in The Dictionary and what to exclude are going to be based on a lexicographer's ideology. And every lexicographer's got one. To presume that dictionary-making can somehow avoid or transcend ideology is simply to subscribe to a particular ideology, one that might aptly be called Unbelievably Naive Positivism.\n\nThere's an even more important way Descriptivists are wrong in thinking that the Scientific Method is appropriate to the study of language:\n\nEven if, as a thought experiment, we assume a kind of nineteenth-century scientific realism-in which, even though some scientists' interpretations of natural phenomena might be biased[22] the natural phenomena themselves can be supposed to exist wholly independent of either observation or interpretation \u2014 no such realist supposition can be made about \"language behavior,\" because this behavior is both human and fundamentally normative. To understand this, you have only to accept the proposition that language is by its very nature public \u2014 i.e., that there can be no such thing as a Private Language[23] and then to observe the way Methodological Descriptivists seem either ignorant of this fact or oblivious to its consequences, as in for example one Charles Fries's introduction to an epigone of Webster's Third called The American College Dictionary:\n\nA dictionary can be an \"authority\" only in the\nsense in which a book of chemistry or of physics\nor of botany can be an \"authority\": by the accuracy\nand the completeness of its record of the observed\nfacts of the field examined, in accord with the latest\nprinciples and techniques of the particular science.\n\nThis is so stupid it practically drools. An \"authoritative\" physics text presents the results of physicists' observations and physicists' theories about those observations. If a physics textbook operated on Descriptivist principles, the fact that some Americans believe that electricity flows better downhill (based on the observed fact that power lines tend to run high above the homes they serve) would require the Electricity Flows Better Downhill Theory to be included as a \"valid\" theory in the textbook \u2014 just as, for Dr. Fries, if some Americans use infer for imply, the use becomes an ipso facto \"valid\" part of the language. Structural linguists like Gove and Fries are not, finally, scientists but census-takers who happen to misconstrue the importance of \"observed facts.\" It isn't scientific phenomena they're tabulating but rather a set of human behaviors, and a lot of human behaviors are \u2014 to be blunt \u2014 moronic. Try, for instance, to imagine an \"authoritative\" ethics textbook whose principles were based on what most people actually do.\n\nNorm-wise, let's keep in mind that language didn't come into being because our hairy ancestors were sitting around the veldt with nothing better to do. Language was invented to serve certain specific purposes:[24] \"That mushroom is poisonous\"; \"Knock these two rocks together and you can start a fire\"; \"This shelter is mine!\" And so on. Clearly, as linguistic communities evolve over time, they discover that some ways of using language are \"better\" than others \u2014 meaning better with respect to the community's purposes. If we assume that one such purpose might be communicating which kinds of food are safe to eat, then you can see how, for example, a misplaced modifier might violate an important norm:\n\n\"People who eat that kind of mushroom often get sick\" confuses the recipient about whether he'll get sick only if he eats the mushroom frequently or whether he stands a good chance of getting sick the very first time he eats it. In other words, the community has a vested practical interest in excluding this kind of misplaced modifier from acceptable usage; and even if a certain percentage of tribesmen screw up and use them, this still doesn't make m.m.'s a good idea.\n\nMaybe now the analogy between usage and ethics is clearer. Just because people sometimes lie, cheat on their taxes, or scream at their kids, this doesn't mean that they think those things are \"good.\" The whole point of norms is to help us evaluate our actions (including utterances) according to what we as a community have decided our real interests and purposes are. Granted, this analysis is oversimplified; in practice it's incredibly hard to arrive at norms and to keep them at least minimally fair or sometimes even to agree on what they are (q.v. today's Culture Wars). But the Descriptivists' assumption that all usage norms are arbitrary and dispensable leads to \u2014 well, have a mushroom.\n\nThe connotations of arbitrary here are tricky, though, and this sort of segues into the second argument Descriptivists make. There is a sense in which specific linguistic conventions are arbitrary. For instance, there's no particular metaphysical reason why our word for a four-legged mammal that gives milk and goes Moo is cow and not, say, prtlmpf. The uptown phrase for this is \"the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign,\" and it's used, along with certain principles of cognitive science and generative grammar, in a more philosophically sophisticated version of Descriptivism that holds the conventions of SWE to be more like the niceties of fashion than like actual norms. This \"Philosophical Descriptivism\" doesn't care much about dictionaries or method; its target is the standard SNOOT claim supra \u2014 that prescriptive rules have their ultimate justification in the community's need to make its language meaningful.\n\nThe argument goes like this. An English sentence's being meaningful is not the same as its being grammatical. That is, such clearly ill-formed constructions as \"Did you seen the car keys of me?\" or \"The show was looked by many people\" are nevertheless comprehensible; the sentences do, more or less, communicate the information they're trying to get across. Add to this the fact that nobody who isn't damaged in some profound Oliver Sacksish way actually ever makes these sorts of very deep syntactic errors[25] and you get the basic proposition of Noam Chomsky's generative linguistics, which is that there exists a Universal Grammar beneath and common to all languages, plus that there is probably an actual part of the human brain that's imprinted with this Universal Grammar the same way birds' brains are imprinted with Fly South and dogs' with Sniff Genitals. There's all kinds of compelling evidence and support for these ideas, not least of which are the advances that linguists and cognitive scientists and A.I. researchers have been able to make with them, and the theories have a lot of credibility, and they are adduced by the Philosophical Descriptivists to show that since the really important rules of language are at birth already hardwired into people's neocortex; SWE prescriptions against dangling participles or mixed metaphors are basically the linguistic equivalent of whalebone corsets and short forks for salad. As Descriptivist Steven Pinker puts it, \"When a scientist considers all the high-tech mental machinery needed to order words into everyday sentences, prescriptive rules are, at best, inconsequential decorations.\"\n\nThis argument is not the barrel of drugged trout that Methodological Descriptivism was, but it's still vulnerable to some objections. The first one is easy. Even if it's true that we're all wired with a Universal Grammar, it simply doesn't follow that all prescriptive rules are superfluous. Some of these rules really do seem to serve clarity, and precision. The injunction against twoway adverbs (\"People who eat this often get sick\") is an obvious example, as are rules about other kinds of misplaced modifiers (\"There are many reasons why lawyers lie, some better than others\") and about relative pronouns' proximity to the nouns they modify (\"She's the mother of an infant daughter who works twelve hours a day\").\n\nGranted the Philosophical Descriptivist can question just how absolutely necessary these rules are, it's quite likely that a recipient of clauses like the above could figure out what the sentences mean from the sentences on either side or from the \"overall context\" or whatever. A listener can usually figure out what I really mean when I misuse infer for imply or say indicate for say, too. But many of these solecisms require at least a couple extra nanoseconds of cognitive effort, a kind of rapid sift-and-discard process, before the recipient gets it. Extra work. It's debatable just how much extra work, but it seems indisputable that we put some extra neural burden on the recipient when we fail to follow certain conventions. W/r/t confusing clauses like the above, it simply seems more \"considerate\" to follow the rules of correct SWE ... just as it's more \"considerate\" to de-slob your home before entertaining guests or to brush your teeth before picking up a date. Not just more considerate but more respectful somehow \u2014 both of your listener and of what you're trying to get across. As we sometimes also say about elements of fashion and etiquette, the way you use English \"Makes a Statement\" or \"Sends a Message\" \u2014 even though these Statements/Messages often have nothing to do with the actual information you're trying to transmit.\n\nWe've now sort of bled into a more serious rejoinder to Philosophical Descriptivism: From the fact that linguistic communication is not strictly dependent on usage and grammar it does not necessarily follow that the traditional rules of usage and grammar are nothing but \"inconsequential decorations.\" Another way to state the objection is that just because something is \"decorative\" does not necessarily make it \"inconsequential.\" Rhetorically, Pinker's flip dismissal is bad tactics, for it invites the very question it begs: inconsequential to whom?\n\nTake, for example, the Descriptivism claim that so-called correct English usages such as brought rather than brung and felt rather than feeled are arbitrary and restrictive and unfair and are supported only by custom and are (like irregular verbs in general) archaic and incommodious and an all-around pain in the ass. Let us concede for the moment that these objections are 100 percent reasonable. Then let's talk about pants. Trousers, slacks. I suggest to you that having the \"correct\" subthoracic clothing for U.S. males be pants instead of skirts is arbitrary (lots of other cultures let men wear skirts), restrictive and unfair (U.S. females get to wear pants), based solely on archaic custom (I think it's got something to do with certain traditions about gender and leg position, the same reasons girls' bikes don't have a crossbar), and in certain ways not only incommodious but illogical (skirts are more comfortable than pants; pants ride up; pants are hot; pants can squish the genitals and reduce fertility; over time pants chafe and erode irregular sections of men's leg hair and give older men hideous half-denuded legs, etc. etc.). Let us grant \u2014 as a thought experiment if nothing else \u2014 that these are all reasonable and compelling objections to pants as an androsartorial norm. Let us in fact in our minds and hearts say yes \u2014 shout yes \u2014 to the skirt, the kilt, the toga, the sarong, the jupe. Let us dream of or even in our spare time work toward an America where nobody lays any arbitrary sumptuary prescriptions on anyone else and we can all go around as comfortable and aerated and unchafed and unsquished and motile as we want.\n\nAnd yet the fact remains that, in the broad cultural mainstream of millennial America, men do not wear skirts. If you, the reader, are a U.S. male, and even if you share my personal objections to pants and dream as I do of a cool and genitally unsquishy American Tomorrow, the odds are still 99.9 percent that in 100 percent of public situations you wear pants/slacks/shorts/trunks. More to the point, if you are a U.S. male and also have a U.S. male child, and if that child were to come to you one evening and announce his desire/intention to wear a skirt rather than pants to school the next day, I am 100-percent confident that you are going to discourage him from doing so. Strongly discourage him. You could be a Molotov-tossing anti-pants radical or a kilt manufacturer or Steven Pinker himself \u2014 you're going to stand over your kid and be prescriptive about an arbitrary, archaic, uncomfortable, and inconsequentially decorative piece of clothing. Why? Well, because in modern America any little boy who comes to school in a skirt (even, say, a modest all-season midi) is going to get stared at and shunned and beaten up and called a Total Geekoid by a whole lot of people whose approval and acceptance are important to him.[26] In our culture, in other words, a boy who wears a skirt is Making a Statement that is going to have all kinds of gruesome social and emotional consequences.\n\nYou see where this is going. I'm going to describe the intended point of the pants analogy in terms I'm sure are simplistic \u2014 doubtless there are whole books in Pragmatics or psycholinguistics or something devoted to unpacking this point. The weird thing is that I've seen neither Descriptivists nor SNOTs deploy it in the Wars.[27]\n\nWhen I say or write something, there are actually a whole lot of different things I am communicating. The propositional content (the actual information I'm trying to convey) is only one part of it. Another part is stuff about me, the communicator. Everyone knows this. It's a function of the fact that there are uncountably many well-formed ways to say the same basic thing, from e.g. \"I was attacked by a bear!\" to \"Goddamn bear tried to kill me!\" to \"That ursine juggernaut bethought to sup upon my person!\" and so on. And different levels of diction and formality are only the simplest kinds of distinction; things get way more complicated in the sorts of interpersonal communication where social relations and feelings and moods come into play. Here's a familiar sort of example. Suppose that you and I are acquaintances and we're in my apartment having a conversation and that at some point I want to terminate the conversation and not have you be in my apartment anymore. Very delicate social moment. Think of all the different ways I can try to handle it: \"Wow, look at the time\"; \"Could we finish this up later?\"; \"Could you please leave now?\"; \"Go\"; \"Get out\"; \"Get the hell out of here\"; \"Didn't you say you had to be someplace?\"; \"Time for you to hit the dusty trail, my friend\"; \"Off you go then, love\"; or that sly old telephone-conversation ender: \"Well, I'm going to let you go now\"; etc. And then think of all the different factors and implications of each option.\n\nThe point here is obvious. It concerns a phenomenon that SNOOTS blindly reinforce and that Descriptivists badly underestimate and that scary vocab-tape ads try to exploit. People really do \"judge\" one another according to their use of language. Constantly. Of course, people judge one another on the basis of all kinds of things \u2014 weight, scent, physiognomy, occupation, make of vehicle[28] \u2014 and, again, doubtless it's all terribly complicated and occupies whole battalions of sociolinguists. But it's clear that at least one component of all this interpersonal semantic judging involves acceptance, meaning not some touchy-feely emotional affirmation but actual acceptance or rejection of somebody's bid to be regarded as a peer, a member of somebody else's collective or community or Group. Another way to come at this is to acknowledge something that in the Usage Wars gets mentioned only in very abstract terms: \"Correct\" English usage is, as a practical matter, a function of whom you're talking to and how you want that person to respond \u2014 not just to your utterance but also to you. In other words, a large part of the agenda of any communication is rhetorical and depends on what some rhet-scholars call \"Audience\" or \"Discourse Community.\"[29] And the United States obviously has a huge number of such Discourse Communities, many of them regional and/or cultural dialects of English: Black English, Latino English, Rural Southern, Urban Southern, Standard Upper-Midwest, Maine Yankee, East-Texas Bayou, Boston BlueCollar, on and on. Everybody knows this. What not everyone knows \u2014 especially not certain Prescriptivists \u2014 is that many of these non-SWE dialects have their own highly developed and internally consistent grammars, and that some of these dialects' usage norms actually make more linguistic/aesthetic sense than do their Standard counterparts (see INTERPOLATION). Plus, of course, there are innumerable sub- and subsubdialects based on all sorts of things that have nothing to do with locale or ethnicity \u2014 Medical-School English, Peorians-Who-Follow-Pro-Wrestling-Closely English, Twelve-Year-Old-Males-Whose-Worldview-Is-Deeply-Informed-By-South-Park English \u2014 and that are nearly incomprehensible to anyone who isn't inside their very tight and specific Discourse Community (which of course is part of their function[30]).\n\nINTERPOLATION: EXAMPLE OF GRAMMATICAL ADVANTAGES OF A NON-STANDARD DIALECT THAT THIS REVIEWER ACTUALLY KNOWS ABOUT FIRSTHAND\n\nThis rev. happens to have two native English dialects \u2014 the SWE of my hypereducated parents and the hard-earned Rural Midwestern of most of my peers. When I'm talking to R.M.'s, I usually use, for example, the construction \"Where's it at?\" instead of \"Where is it?\" Part of this is a naked desire to fit in and not get rejected as an egghead or fag (see sub). But another part is that I, SNOOT or no, believe that this and other R.M.isms are in certain ways superior to their Standard equivalents.\n\nFor a dogmatic Prescriptivist, \"Where's it at?\" is double-damned as a sentence that not only ends with a preposition but whose final preposition forms a redundancy with where that's similar to the redundancy in \"the reason is because\" (which latter usage I'll admit makes me dig my nails into my palms). Rejoinder: First off, the avoid-terminal-prepositions rule is the invention of one Fr. R. Lowth, an eighteenth-century British preacher and indurate pedant who did things like spend scores of pages arguing for hath over the trendy and degenerate has. The a.-t.-p. rule is antiquated and stupid and only the most ayatolloid SNOOT takes it seriously. Garner himself calls the rule \"stuffy\" and lists all kinds of useful constructions like \"the man you were listening to\" that we'd have to discard or distort if we really enforced it.\n\nPlus the apparent redundancy of \"Where's it at?\" [31] is offset by its metrical logic. What the at really does is license the contraction of is after the interrogative adverb. You can't say \"Where's it?\" So the choice is between \"Where is it?\" and \"Where's it at?\", and the latter, a strong anapest, is prettier and trips off the tongue better than \"Where is it?\", whose meter is either a clunky monosyllabic foot + trochee or it's nothing at all.\n\nThis is probably the place for your SNOOT reviewer openly to concede that a certain number of traditional prescriptive rules really are stupid and that people who insist on them (like the legendary assistant to PM. Margaret Thatcher who refused to read any memo with a split infinitive in it, or the jr.-high teacher I had who automatically graded you down if you started a sentence with Hopefully) are that very most pathetic and dangerous sort of SNOOT, the SNOOT Who Is Wrong. The injunction against split infinitives, for instance, is a consequence of the weird fact that English grammar is modeled on Latin even though Latin is a synthetic language and English is an analytic language. [32] Latin infinitives consist of one word and are impossible to as it were split, and the earliest English Prescriptivists \u2014 so enthralled with Latin that their English usage guides were actually written in Latin [33] \u2014 decided that English infinitives shouldn't be split either. Garner himself takes out after the s.i. rule in both SPLIT INFINITIVES and SUPERSTITIONS. [34] And Hopefully at the beginning of a sentence, as a certain cheeky eighth-grader once pointed out to his everlasting social cost, actually functions not as a misplaced modal auxiliary or as a manner adverb like quickly or angrily but as a \"sentence adverb\" that indicates the speaker's attitude about the state of affairs described by the sentence (examples of perfectly OK sentence adverbs are Clearly, Basically, Luckily), and only SNOOTs educated in the high-pedantic years up to 1960 blindly proscribe it or grade it down.\n\nThe cases of split infinitives and Hopefully are in fact often trotted out by dogmatic Descriptivists as evidence that all SWE usage rules are arbitrary and stupid (which is a bit like pointing to Pat Buchanan as evidence that all Republicans are maniacs). Garner rejects Hopefully's knee-jerk proscription, too, albeit grudgingly, including the adverb in his miniessay on SKUNKED TERMS, which is his phrase for a usage that is \"hotly disputed.., any use of it is likely to distract some readers.\" (Garner also points out something I'd never quite realized, which is that hopefully, if misplaced/mispunctuated in the body of a sentence, can create some of the same two-way ambiguities as other adverbs, as in the clause \"I will borrow your book and hopefully read it soon.\")\n\nWhether we're conscious of it or or, most of us are fluent in more than one major English dialect and in a large number of subdialects and are probably at least passable in countless others. Which dialect you choose to use depends, of course, on whom you're addressing. More to the point, I submit that the dialect you use depends mostly on what sort of Group your listener is part of and whether you wish to present yourself as a fellow member of that Group. An obvious example is that traditional upper-class English has certain dialectal differences from lower-class English and that schools used to have courses in Elocution whose whole point was to teach people how to speak in an upper-class way. But usage-as-inclusion is about much more than class. Here's another thought experiment: A bunch of U.S. teenagers in clothes that look far too large for them are sitting together in the local mall's Food Court, and a 53-year-old man with a combover and clothes that fit comes over to them and says that he was scoping them and thinks they're totally rad and/or phat and is it cool if he just kicks it and does the hang here with them. The kids' reaction is going to be either scorn or embarrassment for the guy \u2014 most likely a mix of both. Q: Why? Or imagine that two hard-core urban black guys are standing there talking and I, who am resoundingly and in all ways white, come up and greet them with \"Yo\" and call them \"Brothers\" and ask \"s'up, s'goin on,\" pronouncing on with that NYCish oo-o diphthong that Young Urban Black English deploys for a standard o. Either these guys are going to be offended or they are going to think I am simply out of my mind. No other reaction is remotely foreseeable. Q: Why?\n\nWhy: A dialect of English is learned and used either because it's your native vernacular or because it's the dialect of a Group by which you wish (with some degree of plausibility) to be accepted. And although it is the major and arguably the most important one, SWE is only one dialect. And it is never, or at least hardly ever, anybody's only dialect. This is because there are \u2014 as you and I both know and yet no one in the Usage Wars ever seems to mention \u2014 situations in which faultlessly correct SWE is clearly not the appropriate dialect.\n\nChildhood is full of such situations. This is one reason why SNOOTlets tend to have a very hard social time of it in school. A SNOOTlet is a little kid who's wildly, precociously fluent in SWE (he is often, recall, the offspring of SNOOTs). Just about every class has a SNOOTlet, so I know you've seen them \u2014 these are the sorts of six- to twelve-year-olds who use whom correctly and whose response to striking out in T-ball is to cry out \"How incalculably dreadful!\" etc. The elementary-school SNOOTlet is one of the earliest identifiable species of academic Geekoid and is duly despised by his peers and praised by his teachers. These teachers usually don't see the incredible amounts of punishment the SNOOTlet is receiving from his classmates, or if they do see it they blame the classmates and shake their heads sadly at the vicious and arbitrary cruelty of which children are capable.\n\nBut the other children's punishment of the SNOOTIet is not arbitrary at all. There are important things at stake. Little kids in school are learning about Group-inclusion and -exclusion and about the respective rewards and penalties of same and about the use of dialect and syntax and slang as signals of affinity and inclusion. [35] They're learning about Discourse Communities. Kids learn this stuff not in English or Social Studies but on the playground and at lunch and on the bus. When his peers are giving the SNOOTlet monstrous quadruple Wedgies or holding him down and taking turns spitting on him, there's serious learning going on ... for everyone except the little SNOOT, who in fact is being punished for precisely his failure to learn. What neither he nor his teacher realizes is that the SNOOTlet is deficient in Language Arts. He has only one dialect. He cannot alter his vocabulary, usage, or grammar, cannot use slang or vulgarity; and it's these abilities that are really required for \"peer rapport,\" which is just a fancy Elementary-Ed term for being accepted by the most important Group in the little kid's life.\n\nThis reviewer acknowledges that there seems to be some, umm, personal stuff getting dredged up and worked out here;[36] but the stuff is relevant. The point is that the little A+ SNOOTlet is actually in the same dialectal position as the class's \"slow\" kid who can't learn to stop using ain't or bringed. One is punished in class, the other on the playground, but both are deficient in the same linguistic skill \u2014 viz., the ability to move between various dialects and levels of \"correctness,\" the ability to communicate one way with peers and another way with teachers and another with family and another with Little League coaches and so on. Most of these dialectal adjustments are made below the level of conscious awareness, and our ability to make them seems part psychological and part something else \u2014 perhaps something hardwired into the same motherboard as Universal Grammar \u2014 and in truth this ability is a far better indicator of a kid's \"Verbal I.Q.\" than test scores or grades, since U.S. English classes do far more to retard dialectal talent than to cultivate it.\n\nWell-known fact: In neither K-12 or college English are systematic WE grammar and usage much taught anymore. It's been this way for more than 20 years. The phenomenon drives Prescriptivists nuts, and it's one of the big things they cite as evidence of America's gradual murder of English. Descriptivists and English-Ed specialists counter that grammar and usage have been abandoned because scientific research proved that studying SWE grammar and usage simply doesn't help make kids better writers. Each side in the debate tends to regard the other as mentally ill or/and blinded by political ideology. Neither camp appears ever to have considered whether maybe the way prescriptive SWE was traditionally taught had something to do with its inutility.\n\nBy way here I'm referring not so much to actual method as to spirit or attitude. Most traditional teachers of English grammar have, of course, been dogmatic SNOOTs, and like most dogmatists they've been incredibly stupid about the rhetoric they used and the Audience they were addressing. [37] I refer specifically to their assumption that SWE is the sole appropriate English dialect and that the only reasons anyone could fail to see this are ignorance or amentia or grave deficiencies in character. As rhetoric, this sort of attitude works only in sermons to the Choir, and as pedagogy it's just disastrous. The reality is that an average U.S. student is going to go to the trouble of mastering the difficult conventions of SWE only if he sees SWE's relevant Group or Discourse Community as one he'd like to be part of. And in the absence of any sort of argument for why the correct-SWE Group is a good or desirable one (an argument that, recall, the traditional teacher hasn't given, because he's such a dogmatic SNOOT he sees no need to), the student is going to be reduced to evaluating the desirability of the SWE Group based on the one obvious member of the Group he's encountered, namely the SNOOTy teacher himself.\n\nI'm not suggesting here that an effective SWE pedagogy would require teachers to wear sunglasses and call students \"Dude.\" What I am suggesting is that the rhetorical situation of an English class \u2014 a class composed wholly of young people whose Group identity is rooted in defiance of Adult-Establishment values, plus also composed partly of minorities whose primary dialects are different from SWE \u2014 requires the teacher to come up with overt, honest, compelling arguments for why SWE is a dialect worth learning.\n\nThese arguments are hard to make \u2014 not intellectually but emotionally, politically. Because they are baldly elitist. [38] The real truth, of course, is that SWE is the dialect of the American elite. That it was invented, codified, and promulgated by Privileged WASP Males and is perpetuated as \"Standard\" by same. That it is the shibboleth of the Establishment and an instrument of political power and class division and racial discrimination and all manner of social inequity. These are shall we say rather delicate subjects to bring up in an English class, especially in the service of a pro-SWE argument, and extra-especially if you yourself are both a Privileged WASP Male and the Teacher and thus pretty much a walking symbol of the Adult Establishment. This reviewer's opinion, though, is that both students and SWE are better served if the teacher makes his premises explicit, licit and his argument overt, presenting himself as an advocate of SWE's utility rather than as a prophet of its innate superiority.\n\nBecause this argument is both most delicate and (I believe) most important with respect to students of color, here is one version of a spiel I've given in private conference [39] with certain black students who were (a) bright and inquisitive and (b) deficient in what U.S. higher education considers written English facility:\n\nI don't know whether anybody's told you this or not,\nbut when you're in a college English class you're basically\nstudying a foreign dialect. This dialect is called 'Standard\nWritten English. ... From talking with you and reading\nyour essays, I've concluded that your own primary dialect\nis [one of three variants of SBE common to our region]. Now,\nlet me spell something out in my official Teacher-voice:\nThe SBE you're fluent in is different from SWE in all kinds\nof important ways. Some of these differences are\ngrammatical \u2014 for example, double negatives are OK\nin Standard Black English but not in SWE, and SBE\nand SWE conjugate certain verbs in totally different\nways. Other differences have more to do with style \u2014\nfor instance, Standard Written English tends to use a lot\nmore subordinate clauses in the early parts of sentences,\nand it sets off most of these early subordinates with commas,\nand, under SWE rules, writing that doesn't do this is \"choppy.\"\nThere are tons of differences like that. How much of this\nstuff do you already know?\n[STANDARD RESPONSE: some variation on \"I know from\nthe grades and comments on my papers that English profs\ndon't think I'm a good writer.\"]\nWell, I've got good news and bad news. There are some\notherwise smart English profs who aren't very aware that\nthere are real dialects of English other than SWE, so when\nthey're reading your papers they'll put, like, \"Incorrect\nconjugation\" or \"Comma needed\" instead of \"SWE\nconjugates this verb differently\" or \"SWE calls for a comma\nhere.\" That's the good news \u2014 it's not that you're a\nbad writer, it's that you haven't learned the special\nrules of the dialect they want you to write in. Maybe\nthat's not such good news, that they were grading you\ndown for mistakes in a foreign language you didn't even\nknow was a foreign language. That they won't let you write\nin SBE. Maybe it seems unfair. If it does, you're not going\nto like this news: I'm not going to let you write in SBE\neither. In my class, you have to learn and write in SWE.\nIf you want to study your own dialect and its rules and history\nand how it's different from SWE, fine \u2014 there are some\ngreat books by scholars of Black English, and I'll help you\nfind some and talk about them with you if you want. But\nthat will be outside class. In class \u2014 in my English class \u2014\nyou will have to master and write in Standard Written English,\nwhich we might just as well call \"Standard White English,\"\nbecause it was developed by white people and is used\nby white people, especially educated, powerful white people.\n[RESPONSES by this point vary too widely to standardize.]\nI'm respecting you enough here to give you what I believe is\nthe straight truth. In this country, SWE is perceived as the\ndialect of education and intelligence and power and prestige,\nand anybody of any race, ethnicity, religion, or gender\nwho wants to succeed in American culture has got to be able\nto use SWE. This is How It Is. You can be glad about it or sad\nabout it or deeply pissed off. You can believe it's racist and\nunjust and decide right here and now to spend every waking\nminute of your adult life arguing against it, and maybe you\nshould, but I'll tell you something: If you ever want those\narguments to get listened to and taken seriously, you're\ngoing to have to communicate them in SWE, because SWE is\nthe dialect our country uses to talk to itself. African\nAmericans who've become successful and important in\nU.S. culture know this; that's why King's and X's and\nJackson's speeches are in SWE, and why Morrison's and\nAngelou's and Baldwin's and Wideman's and West's books\nare full of totally ass-kicking SWE, and why black judges\nand politicians and journalists and doctors and teachers\ncommunicate professionally in SWE. Some of these people\ngrew up in homes and communities where SWE was the\nnative dialect, and these black people had it much easier\nin school, but the ones who didn't grow up with SWE\nrealized at some point that they had to learn it and\nbecome able to write in it, and so they did. And [INSERT\nNAME HERE], you're going to learn to use it, too, because\nI am going to make you.\n\nI should note here that a couple of the students I've said this stuff to were offended \u2014 one lodged an Official Complaint \u2014 and that I have had more than one colleague profess to find my spiel \"racially insensitive.\" Perhaps you do, too. My own humble opinion is that some of the cultural and political realities of American life are themselves racially insensitive and elitist and offensive and unfair, and that pussyfooting around these realities with euphemistic doublespeak is not only hypocritical but toxic to the project of ever actually changing them. Such pussyfooting has of course now achieved the status of a dialect \u2014 one powerful enough to have turned the normal politics of the Usage Wars sort of inside out.\n\nI refer here to Politically Correct English (PCE), under whose conventions failing students become \"high-potential\" students and poor people \"economically disadvantaged\" and people in wheelchairs \"differently abled\" and a sentence like \"White English and Black English are different and you better learn White English if you don't want to flunk\" is not blunt but \"insensitive.\" Although it's common to make jokes about PCE (referring to ugly people as \"aesthetically challenged\" and so on), be advised that Politically Correct English's various pre- and proscriptions are taken very seriously indeed by colleges and corporations and government agencies, whose own institutional dialects now evolve under the beady scrutiny of a whole new kind of Language Police.\n\nFrom one perspective, the history of PCE evinces a kind of Lenin-to-Stalinesque irony. That is, the same ideological principles that informed the original Descriptivist revolution \u2014 namely, the sixties-era rejections of traditional authority and traditional inequality \u2014 have now actually produced a far more inflexible Prescriptivism, one unencumbered by tradition or complexity and backed by the threat of real-world sanctions (termination, litigation) for those who fail to conform. This is sort of funny in a dark way, maybe, and most criticism of PCE seems to consist in making fun of its trendiness or vapidity. This reviewer's own opinion is that prescriptive PCE is not just silly but confused and dangerous.\n\nUsage is always political, of course, but it's complexly political. With respect, for instance, to political change, usage conventions can function in two ways: On the one hand they can be a reflection of political change, and on the other they can be an instrument of political change. These two functions are different and have to be kept straight. Confusing them \u2014 in particular, mistaking for political efficacy what is really just a language's political symbolism ... \u2014 enables the bizarre conviction that America ceases to be elitist or unfair simply because Americans stop using certain vocabulary that is historically associated with elitism and unfairness. This is PCE's central fallacy \u2014 that a society's mode of expression is productive of its attitudes rather than a product of those attitudes \u2014 and of course it's nothing but the obverse of the politically conservative SNOOT'S delusion that social change can be retarded by restricting change in standard usage. [40]\n\nForget Stalinization or Logic 101-level equivocations, though. There's a grosser irony about Politically Correct English. This is that PCE purports to be the dialect of progressive reform but is in fact \u2014 in its Orwellian substitution of the euphemisms of social equality for social equality itself \u2014 of vastly more help to conservatives and the U.S. status quo than traditional SNOOT prescriptions ever were. Were I, for instance, a political conservative who opposed taxation as a means of redistributing national wealth, I would be delighted to watch PCE progressives spend their time and energy arguing over whether a poor person should be described as \"low-income\" or \"economically disadvantaged\" or \"pre-prosperous\" rather than constructing effective public arguments for redistributive legislation or higher marginal tax rates on corporations. (Not to mention that strict codes of egalitarian euphemism serve to burke the sorts of painful, unpretty, and sometimes offensive discourse that in a pluralistic democracy leads to actual political change rather than symbolic political change. In other words, PCE functions as a form of censorship, and censorship always serves the status quo.)\n\nAs a practical matter, I strongly doubt whether a guy who has four small kids and makes $12,000 a year feels more empowered or less ill-used by a society that carefully refers to him as \"economically disadvantaged\" rather than \"poor.\" Were I he, in fact, I'd probably find the PCE term insulting \u2014 not just because it's patronizing but because it's hypocritical and self-serving. Like many forms of Vogue Usage,[41] PCE functions primarily to signal and congratulate certain virtues in the speaker \u2014 scrupulous egalitarianism, concern for the dignity of all people, sophistication about the political implications of language \u2014 and so serves the selfish interests of the PC far more than it serves any of the persons or groups renamed.\n\nINTERPOLATION ON A RELATED ISSUE IN THE FACE OF WHOSE GHASTLY MALIGNANCY THIS REVIEWER'S DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT JUST GIVES OUT ALTOGETHER, ADMITTEDLY\n\nThis issue is Academic English, a cancer that has metastasized now to afflict both scholarly writing \u2014\n\nIf such a sublime cyborg would insinuate the\nfuture as post-Fordist subject, his palpably\nmasochistic locations as ecstatic agent of the\nsublime superstate need to be decoded as\nthe \"now all-but-unreadable DNA\" of the fast\nindustrializing Detroit, just as his Robocop-like\nstrategy of carceral negotiation and street\ncontrol remains the tirelessly American one\nof inflicting regeneration through violence\nupon the racially heteroglassic wilds and others\nof the inner city.[42]\n\n\u2014 and prose as mainstream as The Village Voice's:\n\nAt first encounter, the poems' distanced\ncerebral surfaces can be daunting, evading\nphysical location or straightforward emotional\narc. But this seeming remoteness quickly\nreveals a very real passion, centered in the\nspeaker's struggle to define his evolving\nself-construction.\n\nMaybe it's a combination of my SNOOTitude and the fact that I end up having to read a lot of it for my job, but I'm afraid I regard Academic English not as a dialectal variation but as a grotesque debasement of SWE, and loathe it even more than the stilted incoherences of Presidential English (\"This is the best and only way to uncover, destroy, and prevent Iraq from reengineering weapons of mass destruction\") or the mangled pieties of BusinessSpeak (\"Our Mission: to proactively search and provide the optimum networking skills and resources to meet the needs of your growing business\"); and in support of this utter contempt and intolerance I cite no less an authority than Mr. G. Orwell, who 50 years ago had AE pegged as a \"mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence\" in which \"it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning.\"[43]\n\nIt probably isn't the whole explanation, but, as with the voguish hypocrisy of PCE, the obscurity and pretension of Academic English can be attributed in part to a disruption in the delicate rhetorical balance between language as a vector of meaning and language as a vector of the writer's own resume. In other words, it is when a scholar's vanity/insecurity leads him to write primarily to communicate and reinforce his own status as an Intellectual that his English is deformed by pleonasm and pretentious diction (whose function is to signal the writer's erudition) and by opaque abstraction (whose function is to keep anybody from pinning the writer down to a definite assertion that can maybe be refuted or shown to be silly). The latter characteristic, a level of obscurity that often makes it just about impossible to figure out what an AE sentence is really saying, so closely resembles political and corporate doublespeak (\"revenue enhancement,\" \"downsizing,\" pre-owned,\" \"proactive resource-allocation restructuring\") that it's tempting to think AE's real purpose is concealment and its real motivation fear.\n\nThe insecurity that drives AE, PCE, and vocab-tape ads is far from groundless, though. These are tense linguistic times. Blame it on Heisenbergian Uncertainty or postmodern relativism or Image Over Substance or the ubiquity of advertising and P.R. or the rise of Identity Politics or whatever you will \u2014 we live in an era of terrible preoccupation with presentation and interpretation. In rhetorical terms, certain long-held distinctions between the Ethical Appeal, Logical Appeal (= an argument's plausibility or soundness), and Pathetic Appeal (= an argument's emotional impact) have now pretty much collapsed \u2014 or rather the different sorts of Appeals now affect and are affected by one another in ways that make it almost impossible to advance an argument on \"reason\" alone.\n\nA vividly concrete illustration here concerns the Official Complaint a black undergraduate filed against this rev. after one of my little in camera spiels described on pages 53-54. The complainant was (I opine) wrong, but she was not crazy or stupid; and I was able later to see that I did bear some responsibility for the whole nasty administrative swivet. My culpability lay in gross rhetorical naivete. I'd seen my speech's primary Appeal as Logical: The aim was to make a conspicuously blunt, honest argument for SWE's utility. It wasn't pretty, maybe, but it was true, plus so manifestly bullshit-free that I think I anticipated not just acquiescence but gratitude for my candor. [44] The problem I failed to see, of course, lay not with the argument per se but with the person making it \u2014 namely me, a Privileged WASP Male in a position of power, thus someone whose statements about the primacy and utility of the Privileged WASP Male dialect appeared not candid/hortatory/ authoritative/true but elitist/high-handed/ authoritarian/racist. Rhetoric-wise what happened was that I allowed the substance and style of my Logical Appeal to completely torpedo my Ethical Appeal: What the student heard was just another PWM rationalizing why his Group and his English were top dog and ought \"logically\" to stay that way (plus, worse, trying to use his academic power over her to coerce her assent [45] ).\n\nIf for any reason you happen to find yourself sharing this particular student's perceptions and reaction, [46] I would ask that you bracket your feelings long enough to recognize that the PWM instructor's very modern rhetorical dilemma in that office was really no different from the dilemma faced by a male who makes a Pro-Life argument, or an atheist who argues against Creation Science, or a Caucasian who opposes Affirmative Action, or an African American who decries Racial Profiling, or anyone over eighteen who tries to make a case for raising the legal driving age to eighteen, etc. The dilemma has nothing to do with whether the arguments themselves are plausible or right or even sane, because the debate rarely gets that far \u2014 any opponent with sufficiently strong feelings or a dogmatic bent can discredit the arguments and pretty much foreclose all further discussion with a single, terribly familiar rejoinder: \"Of course you'd say that\"; \"Easy for you to say\"; \"What right do you have ...?\"\n\nNow (still bracketing) consider the situation of any reasonably intelligent and well-meaning SNOOT who sits down to prepare a prescriptive usage guide. It's the millennium, post-Everything: Whence the authority to make any sort of credible Appeal for SWE at all?\n\nARTICLE'S CRUX: WHY BRYAN A. GARNER IS A GENIUS, THOUGH OF A RATHER PARTICULAR KIND\n\nIt isn't that A Dictionary of Modern American Usage is perfect It doesn't seem to cover conversant in vs. conversant with, for example, or abstruse vs. obtuse, or to have anything on hereby and herewith (which I tend to use interchangeably but always have the uneasy feeling I'm screwing up). Garner's got a good discussion of used to but nothing on supposed to. Nor does he give any examples to help explain irregular participles and transitivity (\"The light shone\" vs. \"I shined the light,\" etc.), and these would seem to be more important than, say, the correct spelling of huzzah or the plural of animalculum, both of which get discussed. Plus there's the VOGUE WORDS snafu and the absence of a pronunciation entry on trough. [47] In other words, a SNOOT is going to be able to find stuff to quibble about in any usage dictionary, and ADMAU is no exception.\n\nBut it's still really, really good \u2014 and not just lexicographically but rhetorically, politically (if it even makes sense to distinguish these any more). As a collection of judgments, ADMAU is in no way Descriptivist, but Garner structures his judgments very carefully to avoid the elitism and anality of traditional SNOGTitude. He does not deploy irony or scorn or caustic wit, nor tropes or colloquialisms or contractions ... or really any sort of verbal style at all. In fact, even though Garner talks openly about himself and uses the 1-S pronoun throughout the whole dictionary, his personality is oddly effaced, neutralized. It's like he's so bland he's barely there. E.g., as this reviewer was finishing the book's final entry,[48] it struck me that I had no idea whether Bryan Garner was black or white, gay or straight, Democrat or Dittohead. What was even more striking was that I hadn't once wondered about any of this up to now; something about Garner's lexical persona kept me ever from asking where the guy was coming from or what particular agendas or ideologies were informing what he had admitted right up front were \"value judgments.\"\n\nBryan Garner is a genius because the Dictionary of Modern American Usage pretty much resolves the Usage Wars' Crisis of Authority. Garner manages to control the compresence of rhetorical Appeals so cleverly that he appears able to transcend both Usage Wars camps and simply tell the truth, and in a way that does not torpedo his own credibility but actually enhances it. His argumentative strategy is totally brilliant and totally sneaky, and part of both qualities is that it usually doesn't seem like there's even an argument going on at all.\n\nGarner recognizes something that neither of the dogmatic camps appears to get: Given 40 years of the Usage Wars, \"authority\" is no longer something a lexicographer can just presume ex officio. In fact, a large part of the project of any contemporary usage dictionary will consist in establishing this authority. If that seems rather obvious, be apprised that nobody before Garner seems to have figured it out \u2014 that the lexicographer's challenge now is to be not just accurate and comprehensive but credible. That in the absence of unquestioned Authority in language, the reader must now be moved or persuaded to grant a dictionary its authority, freely and for what appear to be good reasons.\n\nGarner's A Dictionary of Modern American Usage is thus both a collection of information and a piece of Democratic rhetoric.[49] Its goal is to recast the Prescriptivist's persona: The author presents himself as an authority not in an autocratic sense but in a technocratic sense. And the technocrat is not only a thoroughly modern and palatable image of Authority but also immune to the charges of elitism/classism that have hobbled traditional Prescriptivism.\n\nOf course, Garner really is a technocrat. He's a lawyer, recall, and in ADMAU he consciously projects a sort of wise juridical persona: knowledgeable, dispassionate, fair, with an almost Enlightenment-grade passion for reason. His judgments about usage tend to be rendered like legal opinions \u2014 exhaustive citation of precedent (other dictionaries' judgments, published examples of actual usage) combined with clear, logical reasoning that's always informed by the larger consensual purposes SWE is meant to serve.\n\nAlso thoroughgoingly technocratic is Garner's approach to the issue of whether anybody's even going to be interested in his 700 pages of fine-pointed counsel. Like any specialist, he simply presumes that there are practical reasons why some people choose to concern themselves with SWE usage; and his attitude about the fact that most Americans \"could care less\" isn't scorn or disapproval but the phlegmatic resignation of a doctor or lawyer who realizes that he can give good advice but can't make you take it:\n\nThe reality I care about most is that some people\nstill want to use the language well.[50] They\nwant to write effectively; they want to speak effectively.\nThey want their language to be graceful at times and\npowerful at times. They want to understand how to\nuse words well, how to manipulate sentences, and how\nto move about in the language without seeming to flail.\nThey want good grammar, but they want more: they\nwant rhetoric[51] in the traditional sense.\nThat is, they want to use the language deftly so that\nit's fit for their purposes.\n\nIt's now possible to see that all the autobiographical stuff in ADMAU's Preface does more than just humanize Mr. Bryan A. Garner. It also serves to detail the early and enduring passion that helps make someone a credible technocrat \u2014 we tend to like and trust experts whose expertise is born of a real love for their specialty instead of just a desire to be expert at something. In fact, it turns out that ADMAU's Preface quietly and steadily invests Garner with every single qualification of modern technocratic Authority: passionate devotion, reason, and accountability (recall \"in the interests of full disclosure, here are the ten critical points ...\"), experience (\"that, after years of working on usage problems, I've settled on\"), exhaustive and tech-savvy research (\"For contemporary usage, the files of our greatest dictionary makers pale in comparison with the fulltext search capabilities now provided by NEXIS and WESTLAW\"), an even and judicious temperament (see e.g. this from HYPERCORRECTION: \"Sometimes people strive to abide by the strictest etiquette, but in the process behave inappropriately\" [52] ), and the sort of humble integrity (for instance, including in one of the entries a past published usage-error of his own) that not only renders Garner likable but transmits the same kind of reverence for English that good jurists have for the law, both of which are bigger and more important than any one person.\n\nProbably the most attractive thing about ADMAU's Ethical Appeal, though, is Garner's scrupulous consideration of the reader's concern about his (or her) own linguistic authority and rhetorical persona and ability to convince an Audience that he cares. Again and again, Garner frames his prescriptions in rhetorical terms, e.g.: \"To the writer or speaker for whom credibility is important, it's a good idea to avoid distracting any readers or listeners.\" Dictionary of Modern American Usage's real thesis, in other words, is that the purposes of the expert authority and the purposes of the lay reader are identical, and identically rhetorical \u2014 which I submit is about as Democratic these days as you're going to get.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. With the advent of online databases, Garner has access to far more examples of actual usage than did Gilman, and he deploys them to great effect. (FYI, Oxford's 1996 New Fowler's Modern English Usage is also extremely comprehensive and good, but its emphasis is on British usage.)\n\n2. Sorry about this phrase: I hate this phrase, too. This happens to be one of those very rare times when \"historical context\" is the phrase to use and there is no equivalent phrase that isn't even worse. (I actually tried \"lexico-temporal backdrop\" in one of the middle drafts, which I think you'll agree is not preferable.)\n\nINTERPOLATION\n\nThe above [paragraph] is motivated by the fact that this reviewer almost always sneers and/or winces when he sees \"historical context\" deployed in a piece of writing and thus hopes to head off any potential sneers/winces from the reader here, especially in an article about felicitous usage.\n\n3. SNOOT (n) (highly colloq) is this reviewer's nuclear family's nickname a clef for a really extreme usage fanatic, the sort of person whose idea of Sunday fun is to look for mistakes in Safire's column's prose itself. This reviewer's family is roughly 70 percent SNOOT, which term itself derives from an acronym, with the big historical family joke being that whether S.N.O.O.T. stood for \"Sprachgefuhl Necessitates Our Ongoing Tendance\" or \"Syntax Nudniks of Our Time\" depended on whether or not you were one.\n\n4. This is true in my own case at any rate \u2014 plus also the \"uncomfortable\" part. I teach college English part-time \u2014 mostly Lit, not Comp. But I am also so pathologically anal about(*) usage that every semester the same thing happens: The minute I have read my students' first set of papers, we immediately abandon the regular Lit syllabus and have a three-week Emergency Remedial Usage Unit, during which my demeanor is basically that of somebody teaching HIV prevention to intravenous-drug users. When it emerges (as it does, every time) that 95 percent of these intelligent upscale college students have never been taught, e.g., what a clause is or why a misplaced \"only\" can make a sentence confusing, I all but pound my head on the blackboard; I exhort them to sue their hometown school boards. The kids end up scared, both of me and for me.\n\n(*) Editor's Note: Author insisted this phrase replace \"obsessed with\" and took umbrage at the suggestion that this change clearly demonstrated the very quality he wished to denigrate.\n\n5. Please note that the strategically repeated 1-P pronoun is meant to iterate and emphasize that this reviewer is very much one too, a SNOOT, plus to connote the nuclear family mentioned supra. SNOOTitude runs in families. In ADMAU's Preface, Bryan Garner mentions both his father and grandfather and actually uses the word genetic, and it's probably true: 95 percent of the SNOOTs I know have at least one parent who is, by profession or temperament or both, a SNOOT. In my own case, my mom is a Comp teacher and has written remedial usage books and is a SNOOT of the most rabid and intractable sort. At least part of the reason I am a SNOOT is that for years Mom brainwashed us in all sorts of subtle ways. Here's an example. Family suppers often involved a game: If one of us children made a usage error. Mom would pretend to have a coughing fit that would go on and on until the relevant child had identified the relevant error and corrected it. It was all very self-ironic and lighthearted; but still, looking back, it seems a bit excessive to pretend that your child is actually denying you oxygen by speaking incorrectly. But the really chilling thing is that I now sometimes find myself playing this same \"game\" with my own students, complete with pretend pertussion.\n\nINTERPOLATION\n\nAs something I'm all but sure Harper's will excise, I'll also insert that we even had a lighthearted but retrospectively chilling little family song that Mom and we little SNOOTlets would sing in the car on long trips while Dad silently rolled his eyes and drove (you have to remember the title theme of Underdog in order to follow the song):\n\nWhen idiots in this world appear\nAnd fail to be concise or clear\nAnd solecisms rend the ear\nThe cry goes up both far and near\n\nFor Blunder Dog\n\nBlunder Dog\n\nBlunder Dog\n\nBlunder Dog\n\n[etc.](*)\n\n(*) (Since this'll almost surely get cut, I'll admit that, yes, I, as a kid, was the actual author of this song. But by this time I'd been thoroughly brainwashed. And just about the whole car sang along. It was sort of our family's version of \"100 Bottles ... Wall.\")\n\n6. If Samuel Johnson is the Shakespeare of English usage, think of Henry Watson Fowler as the Eliot or Joyce. His 1926 A Dictionary of Modern English Usage is the granddaddy of modern usage guides, and its dust-dry wit and blushless imperiousness have been models for every subsequent classic in the field, from Eric Partridge's Usage and Abusage to Theodore Bernstein's The Careful Writer to Wilson Follett's Modern American Usage to Gilman's '89 Webster's.\n\n7. (Garner prescribes spelling out only numbers under ten. I was taught that this rule applies just to Business Writing and that in all other modes you spell out one through nineteen and start using cardinals at 20.(*) De gustibus non est disputandum.)\n\n(*) Editor's Note: The Harper's style manual prescribes spelling out all numbers up to 100.\n\n8. From personal experience, I can assure you that any kid like this is going to be at best marginalized and at worst savagely and repeatedly Wedgied.\nBack\n\n9. What follow in the Preface are \"... the ten critical points that, after years of working on usage problems, I've settled on.\" These points are too involved to treat separately, but a couple of them are slippery in the extreme \u2014 e.g., \"10. Actual Usage. In the end, the actual usage of educated speakers and writers is the over arching criterion for correctness,\" of which both \"educated\" and \"actual\" would require several pages of abstract clarification and qualification to shore up against Usage Wars-related attacks, but which Garner rather ingeniously elects to define and defend via their application in his dictionary itself.\n\n10. There's no better indication of The Dictionary's authority than that we use it to settle wagers. My own father is still to this day living down the outcome of a high-stakes bet on the correct spelling of meringue, a wager made on 14 September 1978.\n\n11. Editor's Note: The Harper's style manual prescribes okay.\n\n12. This is a clever half-truth. Linguists compose only one part of the anti-judgment camp, and their objections to usage judgments involve way more than just \"subjectivity.\"\n\n13. In this last respect, recall for example W. J. Clinton's famous \"I feel your pain,\" which was a blatant if not particularly masterful Ethical Appeal.\n\n14. Really, howled, blistering reviews and outraged editorials from across the country \u2014 from the Times and The New Yorker and good old Life, or q.v. this from the January '62 Atlantic: \"We have seen a novel dictionary formula improvised, in great part, out of snap judgments and the sort of theoretical improvement that in practice impairs; and we have seen the gates propped wide open in enthusiastic hospitality to miscellaneous confusions and corruptions. In fine, the anxiously awaited work that was to have crowned cisatlantic linguistic scholarship with a particular glory turns out to be a scandal and a disaster.\"\n\n15. Note for example the mordant pith (and royal we) of this random snippet from Partridge's Usage and Abusage:\n\nanxious of. `I am not hopeless of our future. But I am\nprofoundly anxious of it', Beverley Nichols, News of England,\n1938: which made us profoundly anxious For (or about)\n\u2014 not of \u2014 Mr Nichols's literary future.\n\nOr see the near-Himalayan condescension of Fowler, here on some other people's use of words to mean things the words don't really mean:\n\nslipshod extension ... is especially likely to occur\nwhen some accident gives currency among the\nuneducated to words of learned origin, & the more\nif they are isolated or have few relatives in the\nvernacular.... The original meaning of feasible is\nsimply doable (L facere do); but to the unlearned\nit is a mere token, of which he has to infer the value\nfrom the contexts in which he hears it used, because\nsuch relatives as it has in English \u2014 Feat, feature,\nfaction, &c. \u2014 either fail to show the obvious\nfamily likeness to which he is accustomed among\nfamilies of indigenous words, or are (like malfeasance)\noutside his range.\n\n16. Utter bushwa: As ADMAU's body makes clear, Garner knows exactly when the Descriptivists started influencing language guides.\n\n17. (which in fact is true)\n\n18. (Q.v. \"The Pharmakon\" in Derrida's La dissemination \u2014 but you'd probably be better off just trusting me.)\n\n19. Standard Written English (SWE) is also sometimes called Standard English (SE) or Educated English, but the inditement-emphasis is the same.\n\nSEMI-INTERPOLATION\n\nPlus note that Garner's Preface explicitly names ADMAU's intended audience as \"writers and editors.\" And even ads for the dictionary in such organs as The New York Review of Books are built around the slogan \"If you like to WRITE ... Rear to us.\"(*)\n\n(*) (Yr. SNOOT rev. cannot help observing, w/r/t these ads, that the opening r in Refer here should not be capitalized after a dependent clause + ellipses \u2014 Quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus.)\n\n20. True, some sort of 100 percent compendious real-time Mega-dictionary might be possible online, though it'd take a small army of lexical webmasters and a much larger army of in situ actual-use reporters and surveillance techs; plus it'd be GNP-level expensive.\n\n21. New Criticism refers to T. S. Eliot and I. A. Richards and F. R. Leavis and Cleanth Brooks and Wimsatt & Beardsley and the whole \"close reading\" school that dominated literary criticism from WWI well into the seventies.\n\n22. (\"EVIDENCE OF CANCER LINK REFUTED BY TOBACCO INSTITUTE RESEARCHERS\")\n\n23. This proposition is in fact true, as is interpolatively demonstrated below, and although the demonstration is extremely persuasive it is also, as you can see from the size of this FN, lengthy and involved and rather, umm, dense, so that again you'd probably be better off simply granting the truth of the proposition and forging on with the main text.\n\nINTERPOLATIVE DEMONSTRATION OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A PRIVATE LANGUAGE\nIt's sometimes tempting to imagine that there can be such a things as Private Language. Many of us are prone to lay-philosophising about the weird privacy of our own mental states, for example, and from the fact that when my knee hurts only I can feel it, it's tempting to conclude that for me the word pain has a very subjective internal meaning that only I can truly understand. This line of thinking is sort of like the adolescent pot-smoker's terror that his own inner experience is both private and unverifiable, a syndrome that is techinically known as Cannabalic Solipsism. Eating ChipsAhoy! and staring very intently at the television's network PGA event, for instance, the adolescent potsmoker is struck by ghastly possibility that, e.g., what he sees as the color green and what other people call \"the color green\" may in fact not be the same color experiences at all The fact that both he and someone else call Pebble Beach's fairways green and a stoplight's GO signal green appears to guarantee only that there is a similar consistency in their color experience of fairways and GO lights, not that the actual subjective quality of those color experiences is the same; it could be that what the ad. pot-smoker experiences as green everyone else actually experiences as blue, and what we \"mean\" by the Word blue is what he \"means\" by green, etc., etc., until the Whole line of thinking gets so vexed and exhausting that the a.p.-s, ends up slumped crumb-strewn and paralyzed in his chair.\n\nThe point here is that the idea of a Private Language, like Private Colors and most of the other solipsistic conceits with which this particular reviewer has at various times been afflicted, is both deluded and demonstrably false.\n\nIn the case of Private Language, the delusion is usually based on the belief that a word such as pain has the meaning it does because it is somehow \"connected\" to a feeling in my knee. But as Mr. L. Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations proved in the 1950s, words actually have the meanings they do because of certain rules and verification tests that are imposed on us from outside our own subjectivities, viz., by the community in which we have to get along and communicate with other people. Wittgenstein's argument, which is admittedly very complex and gnomic and opaque, basically centers on the fact that a word like \"pain\" means what it does for me because of the way the community I'm part of has tacitly agreed to use \"pain\".\n\nIf you're thinking that all this fuss is not only abstract but also pretty irrelevant to the Usage Wars or to anything you have any real interest in at all, you are very much mistaken. If words' meanings depend on transpersonal rules and these rules on community consensus, language is not only conceptually non-Private but also irreducibly public, political, and ideological. This means that questions about our national consensus on grammar and usage arc actually bound up with every last social issue that millennial America's about \u2014 class, race, gender, morality, tolerance, pluralism, cohesion, equality, fairness, money: You name it.\n\n24. Norms, after all, are just practices people have agreed on as optimal ways of doing things for certain purposes. They're not laws, but they're not laissez-faire, either.\n\n25. In his The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language (1994), Steven Pinker puts it this way: \"No one, not even a valley girl, has to be told not to say 'Apples the eat boy' or 'The child seems sleeping' or 'Who did you meet John and?' or the vast, vast majority of the millions of trillions of mathematically possible combinations of words.\n\n26. In the Case of Steve Pinker Jr., those people are the boy's peers and teachers and crossing guards etc. In the case of adult cross-dressers and drag queens who have jobs in the Straight World and wear pants to those jobs, it's coworkers and clients and people on the subway. For the die-hard slob who nevertheless wears a coat and a tie to work, it's mostly his boss, who himself doesn't want his employee's clothes to send clients \"the wrong message.\" But of course it's all basically the same thing.\n\n27. In fact, the only time one ever hears the issue made explicit is in radio ads for tapes that promise to improve people's vocabulary. These ads are extremely ominous and intimidating and always start out with \"DID YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUDGE YOU BY THE WORDS YOU USE?\n\n28. (... not to mention color, gender, creed \u2014 you can see how fraught and charged all this is going to get)\n\n29. Discourse Community is an example of that rare kind of academic jargon that's actually a valuable addition to SWE because it captures something at once very complex and very specific that no other English term quite can.(*)\n\n(*) (The above is an obvious attempt to preempt readerly sneers/winces at the term's continued deployment in this article.)\n\n30. (Plus it's true that whether something gets called a \"subdialect\" or \"jargon\" seems to depend on how much it annoys people outside its Discourse Community. Garner himself has miniessays on AIRLINESE, COMPUTERESE, LEGALESE, and BUREAUCRATESE, and he more or less calls all of them jargon. There is no ADMAU miniessay on DIALECTS, but there is one On JARGON, in which such is Garner's self-restraint that you can almost hear his tendons straining, as in \" [Jargon] arises from the urge to save time and space \u2014 and occasionally to conceal meaning from the uninitiated.\")\n\n31. (a redundancy that's a bit arbitrary, since \"Where's it from?\" isn't redundant [mainly because whence has vanished into semi-archaism])\n\n32. A synthetic language uses inflections to dictate syntax, whereas an analytic language uses word order. Latin, German, and Russian are synthetic; English and Chinese, analytic.\n\n33. (Q.v. for example Sir Thomas Smith's cortex-withering De Recta et Emendata Linguae Anglicae Scriptione Dialogus of 1568.)\n\n34. But note that he's sane about it. Some split infinitives really are clunky and hard to parse, especially when there are a whole bunch of words between to and the verb \u2014 \"We will attempt to swiftly and to the best of our ability respond to these charges\" \u2014 which Garner calls \"wide splits\" and sensibly discourages. His overall verdict on s.i.'s \u2014 which is that some are \"perfectly proper\" and some iffy and some just totally bad news, and that no one wide tidy dogmatic ukase[???] can handle all s.i. cases, and thus that \"knowing when to split an infinitive requires a good ear and a keen eye\" \u2014 is a good example of the way Garner distinguishes sound and helpful Descriptivist objections from wacko or dogmatic objections and then incorporates the sound objections into a smarter and more flexible Prescriptivism.\n\n35. The SNOOTlet is, as it happens, an indispensable part of other kids' playground education. The kids are learning that a Group's identity depends as much on exclusion as inclusion. They are, in other words, starting to learn about Us and Them, and about how an Us always needs a Them because being not-Them is essential to being Us. Because they're kids and it's school, the obvious Them is the teachers and all the values and appurtenances of the teacher world. This teacher-Them helps the kids see how to start to be an Us, but the SNOOTlet completes the puzzle by providing the as it were missing link: He is the Traitor, the Us who is in fact not Us but Them.\n\nIn sum, the SNOOTier is teaching his peers that the criteria for membership in Us are not just age, station, inability to stay up past 9:00, etc. \u2014 that in fact Us is primarily a state of mind and a set of sensibilities. An ideology.\n\n36. (The skirt-in-school scenario was not personal stuff, FYI.)\n\n37. There are still Some of these teachers around, at least here in the Midwest. YOU know the type: lipless, tweedy, cancrine \u2014 Old Maids of both genders. If you had one (as I did, 1976-77), you surely remember him.\n\n38. (Or require us openly to acknowledge and talk about elitism, whereas a dogmatic SNOOT's pedagogy is merely elitism in action.)\n\n39. (I'm not a total idiot.)\n\n40. E.g., this is the reasoning behind many Pop Prescriptivists' complaint that shoddy usage signifies the Decline of Western Civilization.\n\n41. A Dictionary of Modern American Usage includes a miniessay on VOGUE WORDS, but it's a disappointing one in that Garner does little more than list VW's that bug him and say that \"vogue words have such a grip on the popular mind that they come to be used in contexts in which they serve little purpose.\" This is one of the rare places in ADMAU where Garner is simply wrong. The real problem is that every sentence blends and balances at least two different communicative functions \u2014 one the transmission of raw info, the other the transmission of certain stuff about the speaker \u2014 and Vogue Usage throws this balance off. Garher's \"serve little purpose\" is exactly incorrect; vogue words serve too much the purpose of presenting the speaker in a certain light (even if this is merely as with-it or hip), and people's subliminal B.S.-antennae pick this imbalance up, and that's why even nonSNOOTs often find Vogue Usage irritating and creepy.\n\n42. FYI, this passage, which appears in ADMAU's entry on OBSCURITY, is quoted from a 1997 Sacramento Bee article entitled \"No Contest: English Professors Are Worst Writers on Campus.\"\n\n43. This was in his 1946 \"Politics and the English Language,\" an essay that despite its date (and its title's basic redundancy) remains the definitive SNOOT statement on Academese. Orwell's famous AE translation of the gorgeous \"I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift\" in Ecclesiastes as \"Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account\" should be tattooed on the left wrist of every grad student in the anglophone world.\n\n44. Please just don't even say it.\n\n45. (She professed to have been especially traumatized by the climactic \"I am going to make you,\" which in retrospect was indeed a mammoth rhetorical boner.)\n\n46. (The Dept. head and Dean did not, as it happens, share her reaction ... though it would be disingenuous not to tell you that they happened also to be PWM's, which fact did not go unremarked by the complainant, such that the whole proceeding got pretty darn tense, indeed, before it was all over.)\n\n47. To be honest, I noticed this omission only because midway through working on this article I happened to use the word trough in front of the same SNOOT friend who Likes to compare public English to violin-hammering, and he fell sideways out of his chair, and it emerged that I have somehow all my life misheard trough as ending with a th instead of an f and thus have publicly mispronounced it God knows how many scores of times, and I all but burned rubber getting home to see whether perhaps the error was so common and human and understandable that Garner himself had a good-natured entry on it, but no such luck which in fairness I don't suppose I can really blame Garner for.\n\n48. (on zwieback vs. zweiback)\n\n49. (meaning literally Democratictic \u2014 it Wants Your Vote)\n\n50. The last two words of this sentence, of course, are what the Usage Wars are about \u2014 whose \"language\" and whose \"well\"? The most remarkable thing about this sentence is that coming from Garner it doesn't sound naive or obnoxious but just ... reasonable.\n\n51. Did you think I was kidding?\n\n52. (Here this reviewer's indwelling and ever-vigilant SNOOT can't help but question why Garner uses a comma before the conjunction in this sentence, since what follows the conjunction is neither an independent clause nor any kind of plausible complement for strive to.

man\nAnd I should know better, better\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nGot my head in the sky\nAnd my mind knows what it wants\nBut my body just drags me down\n\nAnd my world is something you can't see\nBut it's still very real to me\nYou can find it in the hole where I keep my soul\nThere it is - way down inside me\n\n[Chorus 1]\nThere's a real man\nForget about my body and be a real man\n\n[Verse 2]\nI see with my heart\nI hear with my heart\nI feel with my heart\nSometimes it works better, better\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAnd some so-called friends put me down\nAnd they pity me for trying\nBad emotions push me around\n\nBut the vision shines on and on\nIt will shine when we all are gone\nAnd I'd like to add a little sparkle while I'm here\nLight it up - way down inside me\nYou might also like[Chorus

to criticize\n\n[Pre-Chorus 3]\nYou can laugh at me now (ha ha ha)\nBut the time comes to everybody\nWhen you must decide\n\nWhen that day finally comes along\nYou might wish you'd been a little more strong\nThen you'll wake up in the morning cryin' \"Oh my God\"\nThere it is - way down inside me\n\n[Chorus-Outro]\nIt's a real man\nYou got to grow up sometime\nBe a real man, a real man\nSuffer them slings and arrows\nBe a real man\nNow be a real man\nDon't sell yourself for nothing\nBe a real man, be a real man\nDon't take no crap from no one\nBe a real man, be a real man\nGet your trip

A soft, moist, shapeless mass or matter.\n2. A magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and\nbeing characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper.\n\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary: New College Edition\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP \u2013 MORNING\n\nA normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.\nIt's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,\nthere's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching\non bacon and eating eggs.\n\nTwo of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The\nYoung Man has a slight working-class English accent and,\nlike his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're\ngoing out of style.\n\nIt is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or\nhow old she is; everything she does contradicts something\nshe did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is\nto be said in a rapid pace \"HIS GIRL FRIDAY\" fashion.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nNo, forget it, it's too risky. I'm\nthrough doin' that shit.\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYou always say that, the same thing\nevery time: never again, I'm through,\ntoo dangerous.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI know that's what I always say. I'm\nalways right too, but \u2013\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\n\u2013 but you forget about it in a day\nor two -\n\nYOUNG MAN\n\u2013 yeah, well, the days of me\nforgittin' are over, and the days of\nme rememberin' have just begun.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nWhen you go on like this, you know\nwhat you sound like?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI sound like a sensible fucking man,\nis what I sound like.\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYou sound like a duck.\n(imitates a duck)\nQuack, quack, quack, quack, quack,\nquack, quack...\n\nYOUNG MAN\nWell take heart, 'cause you're never\ngonna hafta hear it again. Because\nsince I'm never gonna do it again,\nyou're never gonna hafta hear me\nquack about how I'm never gonna do\nit again.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nAfter tonight.\n\nThe boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in\nthere, back and forth.\n\nYOUNG MAN\n(with a smile)\nCorrect. I got all tonight to quack.\n\nA WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.\n\nWAITRESS\nCan I get anybody anymore coffee?\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nOh yes, thank you.\n\nThe Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man\nlights up another cigarette.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI'm doin' fine.\n\nThe Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his\nsmoke.\n\nThe Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her\ncoffee.\n\nThe Young Man goes right back into it.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI mean the way it is now, you're\ntakin' the same fuckin' risk as when\nyou rob a bank. You take more of a\nrisk. Banks are easier!  Federal\nbanks aren't supposed to stop you\nanyway, during a robbery. They're\ninsured, why should they care? You\ndon't even need a gun in a federal\nbank. I heard about this guy, walked\ninto a federal bank with a portable\nphone, handed the phone to the teller,\nthe guy on the other end of the phone\nsaid: \"We got this guy's little girl,\nand if you don't give him all your\nmoney, we're gonna kill 'er.\"\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nDid it work?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nFuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm\ntalkin' about! Knucklehead walks in\na bank with a telephone, not a pistol,\nnot a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,\ncleans the place out, and they don't\nlift a fuckin' finger.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nDid they hurt the little girl?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI don't know. There probably never\nwas a little girl \u2013 the point of the\nstory isn't the little girl. The\npoint of the story is they robbed\nthe bank with a telephone.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYou wanna rob banks?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,\nI'm just illustrating that if we\ndid, it would be easier than what we\nbeen doin'.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nSo you don't want to be a bank robber?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nNaw, all those guys are goin' down\nthe same road, either dead or servin'\ntwenty.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nAnd no more liquor stores?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nWhat have we been talking about?\nYeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,\nit ain't the giggle it usta be. Too\nmany foreigners own liquor stores.\nVietnamese, Koreans, they can't\nfuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:\n\"Empty out the register,\" and they\ndon't know what it fuckin' means.\nThey make it too personal. We keep\non, one of those gook motherfuckers'\ngonna make us kill 'em.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nI'm not gonna kill anybody.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI don't wanna kill anybody either.\nBut they'll probably put us in a\nsituation where it's us of them. And\nif it's not the gooks, it these old\nJews who've owned the store for\nfifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got\nGrandpa Irving sittin' behind the\ncounter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try\nwalkin' into one of those stores\nwith nothin' but a telephone, see\nhow far it gets you. Fuck it, forget\nit, we're out of it.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nWell, what else is there, day jobs?\n\nYOUNG MAN\n(laughing)\nNot this life.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nWell what then?\n\nHe calls to the Waitress.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nGarcon! Coffee!\n\nThen looks to his girl.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nThis place.\n\nThe Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.\n\nWAITRESS\n(snotty)\n\"Garcon\" means boy.\n\nShe splits.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nHere? It's a coffee shop.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nWhat's wrong with that? People never\nrob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor\nstores, gas stations, you get your\nhead blown off stickin' up one of\nthem. Restaurants, on the other hand,\nyou catch with their pants down.\nThey're not expecting to get robbed,\nor not as expecting.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\n(taking to idea)\nI bet in places like this you could\ncut down on the hero factor.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nCorrect. Just like banks, these places\nare insured. The managers don't give\na fuck, they're just tryin' to get\nya out the door before you start\npluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget\nit, they ain't takin' a bullet for\nthe register. Busboys, some wetback\ngettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour\ngonna really give a fuck you're\nstealin' from the owner. Customers\nare sittin' there with food in their\nmouths, they don't know what's goin'\non. One minute they're havin' a Denver\nomelet, next minute somebody's\nstickin' a gun in their face.\n\nThe Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man\ncontinues in a low voice.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nSee, I got the idea last liquor store\nwe stuck up. 'Member all those\ncustomers kept comin' in?\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYeah.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nThen you got the idea to take\neverybody's wallet.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nUh-huh.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nThat was a good idea.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nThanks.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nWe made more from the wallets then\nwe did the register.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYes we did.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nA lot of people go to restaurants.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nA lot of wallets.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nPretty smart, huh?\n\nThe Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new\ninformation.\n\nShe sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The\ntired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the\nmotions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the\nCOOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's\nface.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nPretty smart.\n(into it)\nI'm ready, let's go, right here,\nright now.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nRemember, same as before, you're\ncrowd control, I handle the employees.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nGot it.\n\nThey both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on\nthe table. He looks at her and she back at him.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nI love you, Pumpkin.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI love you, Honey Bunny.\n\nAnd with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,\nstand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona\nis that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is\nthat of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.\n\nPUMPKIN\n(yelling to all)\nEverybody be cool this is a robbery!\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nAny of you fuckin' pricks move and\nI'll execute every one of you\nmotherfuckers!

And I don't mean\nin a paper cup either. They give you\na glass of beer, like in a bar. In\nParis, you can buy beer at\nMacDonald's.

Is it as bad as eatin' her out\n\u2013 no, but you're in the same fuckin'\nballpark.\n\nJules stops Vincent.\n\nJULES\nWhoa... whoa... whoa... stop right\nthere.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'\na bitch a foot massage ain't even\nthe same fuckin' thing.\n\nVINCENT\nNot the same thing, the same ballpark.\n\nJULES\nIt ain't no ballpark either. Look\nmaybe your method of massage differs\nfrom mine, but touchin' his lady's\nfeet, and stickin' your tongue in\nher holyiest of holyies, ain't the\nsame ballpark, ain't the same league,\nain't even the same fuckin' sport.\nFoot massages don't mean shit.\n\nVINCENT\nHave you ever given a foot massage?\n\nJULES\nDon't be tellin' me about foot\nmassages \u2013 I'm the foot fuckin'\nmaster.\n\nVINCENT\nGiven a lot of 'em?\n\nJULES\nShit yeah.

That ain't\nright, man. Motherfucker do that to\nme, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause\nI'd kill'a motherfucker.\n\nVINCENT\nI'm not sayin' he was right, but\nyou're sayin' a foot massage don't\nmean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.\nI've given a million ladies a million\nfoot massages and they all meant\nsomethin'.

Take her out. Show her a\ngood time. Don't let her get lonely.\n\nJULES\nYou're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace\nout on a date?\n\nVINCENT\nIt ain't a date.

Jules is the one who does the talking.\n\nJULES\nHow you boys doin'?\n\nNo answer.\n\nJULES\n(to Brett)\nAm I trippin', or did I just ask you\na question.\n\nBRETT\nWe're doin' okay.\n\nAs Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.\n\nJULES\nDo you know who we are?\n\nBrett shakes his head: \"No.\"\n\nJULES\nWe're associates of your business\npartner Marsellus Wallace, you\nremember your business partner\ndont'ya?\n\nNo answer.\n\nJULES\n(to Brett)\nNow I'm gonna take a wild guess here:\nyou're Brett, right?\n\nBRETT\nI'm Brett.\n\nJULES\nI thought so.

Me, I can't\nusually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's\na vegetarian. Which more or less\nmakes me a vegetarian, but I sure\nlove the taste of a good burger.\n(to Brett)\nYou know what they call a Quarter\nPounder with Cheese in France?\n\nBRETT\nNo.\n\nJULES\nTell 'em, Vincent.\n\nVINCENT\nRoyale with Cheese.\n\nJULES\nRoyale with Cheese, you know why\nthey call it that?\n\nBRETT\nBecause of the metric system?\n\nJULES\nCheck out the big brain on Brett.\nYou'a smart motherfucker, that's\nright.

We can't see\nwhat's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent\njust stares at it, transfixed.\n\nJULES\nWe happy?\n\nNo answer from the transfixed Vincent.\n\nJULES\nVincent!\n\nVincent looks up at Jules.\n\nJULES\nWe happy?\n\nClosing the case.\n\nVINCENT\nWe're happy.\n\nBRETT\n(to Jules)\nLook, what's your name?

When we\nentered into this thing, we only had\nthe best intentions \u2013\n\nAs Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger\nthree times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.\n\nVince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.\n\nBrett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,\nbut he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.\n\nJULES\n(to Brett)\nOh, I'm sorry. Did that break your\nconcentration? I didn't mean to do\nthat.  Please, continue. I believe\nyou were saying something about \"best\nintentions.\"\n\nBrett can't say a word.\n\nJULES\nWhatsamatter? Oh, you were through\nanyway.  Well, let me retort. Would\nyou describe for me what Marsellus\nWallace looks like?\n\nBrett still can't speak.\n\nJules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing\nthe only barrier between himself and Brett.

Ya tried ta fuck\n'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?\n\nBRETT\n(in spasm)\nYes.\n\nJULES\nThere's a passage I got memorized,\nseems appropriate for this situation:\nEzekiel 25:17. \"The path of the\nrighteous man is beset on all sides\nby the inequities of the selfish and\nthe tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is\nhe who, in the name of charity and\ngood will, shepherds the weak through\nthe valley of darkness, for he is\ntruly his brother's keeper and the\nfinder of lost children. And I will\nstrike down upon thee with great\nvengeance and furious anger those\nwho attempt to poison and destroy my\nbrothers.

JACKRABBIT SLIM'S \u2013 NIGHT\n\nIn the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over\nL.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're\nall basically the same. Decor out of an \"Archie\" comic book,\nGolden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,\nsaucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the\nFats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and\nover prices that pay for all this bullshit.\n\nBut then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's\ndiners.\n\nEither the best or the worst, depending on your point of\nview.\n\nVincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with\na neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a\nred windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath\nthe cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that\nis the slogan: \"Next best thing to a time machine.\"\n\nVINCENT\nWhat the fuck is this place?\n\nMIA\nThis is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis\nman should love it.\n\nVINCENT\nCome on, Mia, let's go get a steak.\n\nMIA\nYou can get a steak here, daddy-o.\nDon't be a...\n\nMia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on\nthe screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.\n\nVINCENT\nAfter you, kitty-cat.\n\nINT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S \u2013 NIGHT\n\nCompared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint\nEnglish pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over\nthe wall\n\n(\"ROCK ALL NIGHT,\" \"HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL,\" \"ATTACK OF\nTHE CRAB MONSTER,\" and \"MACHINE GUN KELLY\"). The booths that\nthe patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s\ncars.\n\nIn the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign\non the wall states, \"No shoes allowed.\" Some wannabe beboppers\n(actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or\nbarefeet.\n\nThe picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,\nB & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The\nWAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:\nMARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and\nLEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing\nappropriate costumes.\n\nVincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red\n'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting\na big button on his chest that says: \"Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing\nyou please me.\"\n\nBUDDY\nHi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?\n\nVINCENT\nI'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.\n\nBUDDY\nHow d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,\nor bloody as hell?\n\nVINCENT\nBloody as hell. And to drink, a\nvanilla coke.\n\nBUDDY\nHow 'bout you, Peggy Sue?\n\nMIA\nI'll have the Durwood Kirby burger \u2013\nbloody \u2013 and a five-dollar shake.\n\nBUDDY\nHow d'ya want that shake, Martin and\nLewis, or Amos and Andy?\n\nMIA\nMartin and Lewis.\n\nVINCENT\nDid you just order a five-dollar\nshake?\n\nMIA\nSure did.\n\nVINCENT\nA shake? Milk and ice cream?\n\nMIA\nUh-huh.\n\nVINCENT\nIt costs five dollars?\n\nBUDDY\nYep.\n\nVINCENT\nYou don't put bourbon in it or\nanything?\n\nBUDDY\nNope.\n\nVINCENT\nJust checking.\n\nBuddy exits.\n\nVincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are\ndancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers,\nand the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing,\nThe Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her\ncustomers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a\nfool.\n\nMIA\nWhaddya think?\n\nVINCENT\nIt's like a wax museum with a pulse\nrate.\n\nVincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling\nhimself a smoke.\n\nAfter a second of watching him \u2013\n\nMIA\nWhat are you doing?\n\nVINCENT\nRollin' a smoke.\n\nMIA\nHere?\n\nVINCENT\nIt's just tobacco.\n\nMIA\nOh. Well in that case, will you roll\nme one, cowboy?\n\nAs he finishes licking it \u2013\n\nVINCENT\nYou can have this one, cowgirl.\n\nHe hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to\nher lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's\nhand. He lights it.\n\nMIA\nThanks.\n\nVINCENT\nThink nothing of it.\n\nHe begins rolling one for himself.\n\nAs this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,\nmaking everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a\nsquare vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS\nthe skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out\na squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.\n\nBack to Mia and Vincent.\n\nMIA\nMarsellus said you just got back\nfrom Amsterdam.\n\nVINCENT\nSure did. I heard you did a pilot.\n\nMIA\nThat was my fifteen minutes.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat was it?\n\nMIA\nIt was show about a team of female\nsecret agents called \"Fox Force Five.\"\n\nVINCENT\nWhat?\n\nMIA\n\"Fox Force Five.\" Fox, as in we're a\nbunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in\nwe're a force to be reckoned with.\nFive, as in there's one... two ...\nthree... four... five of us. There\nwas a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal\nfrom that show \"Baton Rouge,\" she\nwas the leader. A Japanese one, a\nblack one, a French one and a brunette\none, me.  We all had special skills.\nSommerset had a photographic memory,\nthe Japanese fox was a kung fu master,\nthe black girl was a demolition\nexpert, the French fox' specialty\nwas sex...\n\nVINCENT\nWhat was your specialty?\n\nMIA\nKnives. The character I played, Raven\nMcCoy, her background was she was\nraised by circus performers. So she\ngrew up doing a knife act. According\nto the show, she was the deadliest\nwoman in the world with a knife. But\nbecause she grew up in a circus, she\nwas also something of an acrobat.\nShe could do illusions, she was a\ntrapeze artist \u2013 when you're keeping\nthe world safe from evil, you never\nknow when being a trapeze artist's\ngonna come in handy. And she knew a\nzillion old jokes her grandfather,\nan old vaudevillian, taught her. If\nwe woulda got picked up, they woulda\nworked in a gimmick where every\nepisode I woulda told and ol joke.\n\nVINCENT\nDo you remember any of the jokes?\n\nMIA\nWell I only got the chance to say\none, 'cause we only did one show.\n\nVINCENT\nTell me.\n\nMIA\nNo. It's really corny.\n\nVINCENT\nC'mon, don't be that way.\n\nMIA\nNo. You won't like it and I'll be\nembarrassed.\n\nVINCENT\nYou told it in front of fifty million\npeople and you can't tell it to me?\nI promise I won't laugh.\n\nMIA\n(laughing)\nThat's what I'm afraid of.\n\nVINCENT\nThat's not what I meant and you know\nit.\n\nMIA\nYou're quite the silver tongue devil,\naren't you?\n\nVINCENT\nI meant I wouldn't laugh at you.\n\nMIA\nThat's not what you said Vince. Well\nnow I'm definitely not gonna tell\nya, 'cause it's been built up too\nmuch.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat a gyp.\n\nBuddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around\nthe straw of her shake.\n\nMIA\nYummy!\n\nVINCENT\nCan I have a sip of that? I'd like\nto know what a five-dollar shake\ntastes like.\n\nMIA\nBe my guest.\n\nShe slides the shake over to him.\n\nMIA\nYou can use my straw, I don't have\nkooties.\n\nVincent smiles.\n\nVINCENT\nYeah, but maybe I do.\n\nMIA\nKooties I can handle.\n\nHe takes a sip.\n\nVINCENT\nGoddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'\ngood milk shake.\n\nMIA\nTold ya.\n\nVINCENT\nI don't know if it's worth five\ndollars, but it's pretty fuckin'\ngood.\n\nHe slides the shake back.\n\nThen the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.\n\nMIA\nDon't you hate that?\n\nVINCENT\nWhat?\n\nMIA\nUncomfortable silences. Why do we\nfeel it's necessary to yak about\nbullshit in order to be comfortable?\n\nVINCENT\nI don't know.\n\nMIA\nThat's when you know you found\nsomebody special. When you can just\nshut the fuck up for a minute, and\ncomfortably share silence.\n\nVINCENT\nI don't think we're there yet. But\ndon't feel bad, we just met each\nother.\n\nMIA\nWell I'll tell you what, I'll go to\nthe bathroom and powder my nose,\nwhile you sit here and think of\nsomething to say.\n\nVINCENT\nI'll do that.\n\nINT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nMia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the\nbathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.\n\nMIA\n(imitating Steppenwolf)\nI said goddamn!\n\nINT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nVincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his\neyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.\n\nMia comes back to the table.\n\nMIA\nDon't you love it when you go to the\nbathroom and you come back to find\nyour food waiting for you?\n\nVINCENT\nWe're lucky we got it at all. Buddy\nHolly doesn't seem to be much of a\nwaiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn\nMonroe's section.\n\nMIA\nWhich one, there's two Marilyn\nMonroes.\n\nVINCENT\nNo there's not.\n\nPointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.\n\nVINCENT\nThat's Marilyn Monroe...\n\nThen, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and\ncapri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS \u2013\n\nVINCENT\n... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I\ndon't see Jayne Mansfield, so it\nmust be her night off.\n\nMIA\nPretty smart.\n\nVINCENT\nI have moments.\n\nMIA\nDid ya think of something to say?\n\nVINCENT\nActually, there's something I've\nwanted to ask you about, but you\nseem like a nice person, and I didn't\nwant to offend you.\n\nMIA\nOooohhhh, this doesn't sound like\nmindless, boring, getting-to-know-\nyou chit-chat. This sounds like you\nactually have something to say.\n\nVINCENT\nOnly if you promise not to get\noffended.\n\nMIA\nYou can't promise something like\nthat. I have no idea what you're\ngonna ask. You could ask me what\nyou're gonna ask me, and my natural\nresponse could be to be offended.\nThen, through no fault of my own, I\nwoulda broken my promise.\n\nVINCENT\nThen let's just forget it.\n\nMIA\nThat is an impossibility. Trying to\nforget anything as intriguing as\nthis would be an exercise in futility.\n\nVINCENT\nIs that a fact?\n\nMia nods her head: \"Yes.\"\n\nMIA\nBesides, it's more exciting when you\ndon't have permission.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat do you think about what happened\nto Antwan?\n\nMIA\nWho's Antwan?\n\nVINCENT\nTony Rocky Horror.\n\nMIA\nHe fell out of a window.\n\nVINCENT\nThat's one way to say it. Another\nway is, he was thrown out. Another\nwas is, he was thrown out by\nMarsellus. And even another way is,\nhe was thrown out of a window by\nMarsellus because of you.\n\nMIA\nIs that a fact?\n\nVINCENT\nNo it's not, it's just what I heard.\n\nMIA\nWho told you this?\n\nVINCENT\nThey.\n\nMia and Vincent smile.\n\nMIA\nThey talk a lot, don't they?\n\nVINCENT\nThey certainly do.\n\nMIA\nWell don't be shy Vincent, what\nexactly did they say?\n\nVincent is slow to answer.\n\nMIA\nLet me help you Bashful, did it\ninvolve the F-word?\n\nVINCENT\nNo. They just said Rocky Horror gave\nyou a foot massage.\n\nMIA\nAnd...?\n\nVINCENT\nNo and, that's it.\n\nMIA\nYou heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror\nout of a four-story window because\nhe massaged my feet?\n\nVINCENT\nYeah.\n\nMIA\nAnd you believed that?\n\nVINCENT\nAt the time I was told, it seemed\nreasonable.\n\nMIA\nMarsellus throwing Tony out of a\nfour-story window for giving me a\nfoot massage seemed reasonable?\n\nVINCENT\nNo, it seemed excessive. But that\ndoesn't mean it didn't happen. I\nheard Marsellus is very protective\nof you.\n\nMIA\nA husband being protective of his\nwife is one thing. A husband almost\nkilling another man for touching his\nwife's feet is something else.\n\nVINCENT\nBut did it happen?\n\nMIA\nThe only thing Antwan ever touched\nof mine was my hand, when he shook\nit. I met Anwan once \u2013 at my wedding\n\u2013 then never again.  The truth is,\nnobody knows why Marsellus tossed\nTony Rocky Horror out of that window\nexcept Marsellus and Tony Rocky\nHorror. But when you scamps get\ntogether, you're worse than a sewing\ncircle.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE\n\nED SULLIVAN\n(into microphone)\nLadies and gentlemen, now the moment\nyou've all been waiting for, the\nworldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist\ncontest.\n\nPatrons cheer.\n\nEd Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy.\n\nED SULLIVAN\n...One lucky couple will win this\nhandsome trophy that Marilyn here is\nholding.\n\nMarilyn holds the trophy.\n\nED SULLIVAN\n...Now, who will be our first\ncontestants?\n\nMia holds her hand.\n\nMIA\nRight here.\n\nVincent reacts.\n\nMIA\nI wanna dance.\n\nVINCENT\nNo, no, no no, no, no, no, no.\n\nMIA\n(overlapping)\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do\nbelieve Marsellus, my husband, your\nboss, told you to take me out and do\nwhatever I wanted, Now, I want to\ndance. I want to win. I want that\ntrophy.\n\nVINCENT\n(sighs)\nAll right.\n\nMIA\nSo, dance good.\n\nVINCENT\nAll right, you asked for it.\n\nVincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.\n\nED SULLIVAN\n(into microphone)\nLet's hear it for our first\ncontestants.\n\nPatrons cheer.\n\nVincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.\n\nED SULLIVAN\nNow let's meet our first contestants\nhere this evening.

Take it away!\n\nMia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's \"YOU NEVER CAN TELL\".\nThey make hand movements as they dance.\n\nINT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME \u2013 NIGHT\n\nThe front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-\nstyle into the house, singing a cappella the song from the\nprevious scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.\n\nThen...\n\nThe two just stand face to face looking at each other.\n\nVINCENT\nWas than an uncomfortable silence?\n\nMIA\nI don't know what that was.\n(pause)\nMusic and drinks!\n\nMia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his\novercoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.\n\nVINCENT\nI'm gonna take a piss.\n\nMIA\nThat was a little bit more information\nthan I needed to know, but go right\nahead.\n\nVincent shuffles off to the john.\n\nMia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs\nand selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high\nenergy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She\ndances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's\novercoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It\nfeels good.\n\nHer hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.\nLike a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco\non some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks\nthe paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a\nlittle too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so\nanyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out\nhis Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,\ntrying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you\nknow, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly\nbrings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,\nthen LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.\n\nThe Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she\ntakes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in\nthe overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something\nelse. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder\ninside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.\nWearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her\nface.\n\nMIA\n(like you would say\nBingo!)\nDisco! Vince, you little cola nut,\nyou've been holding out on me.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nVincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to\nhimself in the mirror.\n\nVINCENT\nOne drink and leave. Don't be rude,\nbut drink your drink quickly, say\ngoodbye, walk out the door, get in\nyour car, and go down the road.\n\nLIVING ROOM\n\nMia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines\non her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred\ndollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the\nfat line.\n\nCLOSEUP \u2013 MIA\n\nHer head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels\nlike it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.\nThen... the rush hits...\n\nBATHROOM\n\nVincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his\ndialogue with the mirror.\n\nVINCENT\n...It's a moral test of yourself,\nwhether or not you can maintain\nloyalty. Because when people are\nloyal to each other, that's very\nmeaningful.\n\nLIVING ROOM\n\nMia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but\nit's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from\nher knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her\nstomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.\n\nBATHROOM\n\nVince continues.\n\nVINCENT\nSo you're gonna go out there, drink\nyour drink, say \"Goodnight, I've had\na very lovely evening,\" go home, and\njack off.  And that's all you're\ngonna do.\n\nNow that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's\nready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of\nthat door. So he goes through it.\n\nLIVING ROOM\n\nWe follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to\nthe living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like\na rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are\ndown her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the\ntightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her\nface are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.\nSlack-jawed.\n\nVINCENT\nOH Jesus Christ!\nJesus Fuckin Christ\nOh Fuck me\n\nVincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.\nBending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck\nto check her pulse. She slightly stirs.\n\nMia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.\n\nVINCENT\n(sounding weird)\nMia! MIA! What the hell happened?\n\nBut she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,\nbut they're not distinctive enough to be called words.\n\nVincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.\n\nVINCENT\n(to himself)\nI'll be a son-of-a-bitch.\n(to Mia)\nMia! MIA! What did you take? Answer\nme honey, what did you take?\n\nMia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.\n\nVincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the\nrack.\n\nHe goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent\nmakes a beeline to Mia. We follow.\n\nVINCENT\n(yelling to Mia)\nOkay honey, we're getting you on\nyour feet.\n\nHe reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.\n\nVINCENT\nWe're on our feet now, and now we're\ngonna talk out to the car. Here we\ngo, watch us walk.\n\nWe follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-\nunconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.\n\nEXT.

He frantically starts scanning\nthe junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words,\n\"Come on,\" endlessly.\n\nFrom OFF SCREEN we hear:\n\nVINCENT (O.S.)\nHurry up man! We're losin' her!\n\nLANCE\n(calling back)\nI'm looking as fast as I can!\n\nLance continues his frenzied search.\n\nWE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.\n\nJODY (O.S.)\nWhat's he lookin' for?\n\nVINCENT (O.S.)\nI dunno, some medical book.\n\nJody calls to LANCE.\n\nJODY (O.S.)\nWhat are you lookin' for?\n\nLANCE\nMy black medical book!\n\nAs he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit,\nJody appears in the doorway.\n\nJODY\nWhata're you looking for?\n\nLANCE\nMy black fuckin' medical book. It's\nlike a text book they give to nurses.\n\nJODY\nI never saw a medical book.\n\nLANCE\nTrust me, I have one.\n\nJODY\nWell if it's that important, why\ndidn't you keep it with the shot?\n\nLance spins toward her.\n\nLANCE\nI don't know!

He\nopens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.\n\nLANCE\nWhile I'm doing this, take her shirt\noff and find her heart.\n\nVince rips her blouse open.\n\nJody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.\n\nVINCENT\nDoes it have to be exact?\n\nLANCE\nYeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving\nher an injection in the heart, so I\ngotta exactly hit her in the heart.\n\nVINCENT\nWell, I don't know exactly where her\nheart is, I think it's here.\n\nVince points to Mia's right breast.

You brought\n'er here, that means you give her\nthe shot. The day I bring an ODing\nbitch to your place, then I gotta\ngive her the shot.\n\nJody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic\nmarker in her hand.\n\nJODY\nGot it.\n\nVincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes\na big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.\n\nVINCENT\nOkay, what do I do?\n\nLANCE\nWell, you're giving her an injection\nof adrenaline straight to her heart.\nBut she's got a breast plate in front\nof her heart, so you gotta pierce\nthrough that. So what you gotta do\nis bring the needle down in a stabbing\nmotion.\n\nLance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like \"The\nShape\" killing its victims in \"HALLOWEEN\".\n\nVINCENT\nI gotta stab her?\n\nLANCE\nIf you want the needle to pierce\nthrough to her heart, you gotta stab\nher hard.\n\nThen once you do, push down on the plunger.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat happens after that?\n\nLANCE\nI'm curious about that myself.\n\nVINCENT\nThis ain't a fuckin' joke man!\n\nLANCE\nShe's supposed to come out of it\nlike \u2013\n(snaps his fingers)\n\u2013 that.\n\nVincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing\nmotion.\n\nHe looks down on Mia.\n\nMia is fading fast.

She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck\nin her chest \u2013 SCREAMING.\n\nVincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in\nfront of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.\n\nMia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of\nair.\n\nThe other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken\nto their bones, look to see if she's alright.\n\nLANCE\nIf you're okay, say something.\n\nMia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a\nrelatively normal voice.\n\nMIA\nSomething.\n\nVincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and\nshaking from how close to death Mia came.\n\nJODY\nAnybody want a beer?\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT.

BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish,\nstands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to\nher is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force\nofficer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old\nboy.\n\nMOTHER\nButch, stop watching TV a second. We\ngot a special visitor. Now do you\nremember when I told you your daddy\ndies in a P.O.W. camp?\n\nBUTCH (O.S.)\nUh-huh.\n\nMOTHER\nWell this here is Capt. Koons. He\nwas in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.\n\nCAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and\nbends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's\neyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas\naccent.\n\nCAPT. KOONS\nHello, little man. Boy I sure heard\na bunch about you. See, I was a good\nfriend of your Daddy's. We were in\nthat Hanoi pit of hell over five\nyears together.  Hopefully, you'll\nnever have to experience this\nyourself, but when two men are in a\nsituation like me and your Daddy\nwere, for as long as we were, you\ntake on certain responsibilities of\nthe other. If it had been me who had\nnot made it, Major Coolidge would be\ntalkin' right now to my son Jim. But\nthe way it worked out is I'm talkin'\nto you, Butch. I got somethin' for\nya.\n\nThe Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.\n\nCAPT. KOONS\nThis watch I got here was first\npurchased by your great-granddaddy.\nIt was bought during the First World\nWar in a little general store in\nKnoxville, Tennessee. It was bought\nby private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge\nthe day he set sail for Paris. It\nwas your great-granddaddy's war watch,\nmade by the first company to ever\nmake wrist watches. You see, up until\nthen, people just carried pocket\nwatches. Your great-granddaddy wore\nthat watch every day he was in the\nwar. Then when he had done his duty,\nhe went home to your great-\ngrandmother, took the watch off his\nwrist and put it in an ol' coffee\ncan. And in that can it stayed 'til\nyour grandfather Dane Coolidge was\ncalled upon by his country to go\noverseas and fight the Germans once\nagain. This time they called it World\nWar Two. Your great-granddaddy gave\nit to your granddad for good luck.\nUnfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as\ngood as his old man's. Your granddad\nwas a Marine and he was killed with\nall the other Marines at the battle\nof Wake Island. Your granddad was\nfacing death and he knew it. None of\nthose boys had any illusions about\never leavin' that island alive. So\nthree days before the Japanese took\nthe island, your 22-year old\ngrandfather asked a gunner on an Air\nForce transport named Winocki, a man\nhe had never met before in his life,\nto deliver to his infant son, who he\nhad never seen in the flesh, his\ngold watch. Three days later, your\ngrandfather was dead. But Winocki\nkept his word. After the war was\nover, he paid a visit to your\ngrandmother, delivering to your infant\nfather, his Dad's gold watch. This\nwatch. This watch was on your Daddy's\nwrist when he was shot down over\nHanoi. He was captured and put in a\nVietnamese prison camp. Now he knew\nif the gooks ever saw the watch it'd\nbe confiscated. The way your Daddy\nlooked at it, that watch was your\nbirthright. And he'd be damned if\nand slopeheads were gonna put their\ngreasy yella hands on his boy's\nbirthright. So he hid it in the one\nplace he knew he could hide somethin'.\nHis ass. Five long years, he wore\nthis watch up his ass. Then when he\ndied of dysentery, he gave me the\nwatch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk\nof metal up my ass for two years.\nThen, after seven years, I was sent\nhome to my family. And now, little\nman, I give the watch to you.\n\nCapt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes\ninto FRAME to accept it.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LOCKER ROOM \u2013 NIGHT\n\nThe 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:\ntrunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few\nzzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to\nhim, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory,\nhe wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.\n\nHis trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a\nlittle, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to\nbe breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.\n\nKLONDIKE\nIt's time, Butch.\n\nBUTCH\nI'm ready.\n\nKlondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB\noutside.\n\nHe goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch\nhops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him\non with the robe, which says on the back: \"BATTLING BUTCH\nCOOLIDGE\".\n\nThe two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for\nButch.\n\nAs Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit.\nKlondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet,\nempty locker room.\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\nTITLE CARD:\n\n\"THE GOLD WATCH\"\n\nWe hear over the black and white title:\n\nSPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)\n\u2013 Well Dan, that had to be the\nbloodiest and, hands-down, the most\nbrutal fight this city has ever seen.\n\nThe SOUND of chaos in the b.g.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT.

Do you think\nhe knew Willis was dead?\n\nSPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)\nMy guess would be yes, Richard.

But it's of\nparamount importance that during the\nsad weeks ahead, the eyes of the\nW.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the \u2013\n\nCLICK \u2013 Esmarelda shuts off the radio.\n\nShe takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in\nthe alley.

A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage\ndumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed\nin boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to\nthe dumpster below.\n\nESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.\n\nGym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS\nto the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and\nthrows it to the ground.\n\nINT.

I never thanked you for the\ndinner.\n\nIn the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table \u2013\ndead.\n\nHis face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is\non his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.\n\nThe huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table,\nhand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.\nWe still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.\n\nMia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.\n\nMarsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.\n\nMARSELLUS (O.S.)\nWhat'cha got?\n\nENGLISH DAVE\nHe booked.\n\nMARSELLUS (O.S.)\nI'm prepared to scour the earth for\nthis motherfucker.

But on a\nwoman, a pot belly is very sexy. The\nrest of you is normal. Normal face,\nnormal legs, normal hips, normal\nass, but with a big, perfectly round\npot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a\ntee-shirt two sizes too small to\naccentuate it.\n\nBUTCH\nYou think guys would find that\nattractive?\n\nFABIENNE\nI don't give a damn what men find\nattractive.

He won't be fighting no\nmore?!\n\nBUTCH\nNot no more.\n\nFABIENNE\nSo it all worked out in the finish?\n\nBUTCH\nWe ain't at the finish, baby.\n\nFabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.\n\nFABIENNE\nWe're in a lot of danger, aren't we?\n\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nIf they find us, they'll kill us,\nwon't they?\n\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nBut they won't find us, will they?\n\nButch nods his head: \"no.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nDo you still want me to go with you?\n\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nI don't want to be a burden or a\nnuisance -\n\nButch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her\ncrotch.\n\nFabienne reacts.\n\nFABIENNE\nSay it!\n\nBUTCH\nFabienne, I want you to be with me.\n\nFABIENNE\nForever?\n\nBUTCH\n...and ever.\n\nFabienne lies her head back.\n\nButch continues to massage her crotch.\n\nFABIENNE\nDo you love me?\n\nBUTCH\nOui.\n\nFABIENNE\nButch? Will you give me oral pleasure?\n\nButch kisses her on the mouth.\n\nBUTCH\nWill you kiss it?\n\nShe nods her head: \"yes.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nBut you first.\n\nButch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral\npleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.\n\nFABIENNE\n(in French, with\nEnglish subtitles)\nButch my love, the adventure begins.\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\nFADE UP:\n\nMOTEL ROOM\n\nSame motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in\nthe bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We\nsee Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow\nher up.\n\nShe's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower\nwashing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the\nsmoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.\nButch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his\nhead out.\n\nBUTCH\nI think I cracked a rib.\n\nFABIENNE\nGiving me oral pleasure?\n\nBUTCH\nNo retard, from the fight.\n\nFABIENNE\nDon't call me retard.\n\nBUTCH\n(in a Mongoloid voice)\nMy name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!\n\nFABIENNE\nShut up fuck head! I hate that\nMongoloid voice.\n\nBUTCH\nOkay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it\nback!  Can I have a towel please,\nMiss Beautiful Tulip.\n\nFABIENNE\nOh I like that, I like being called\na tulip. Tulip is much better than\nMongoloid.\n\nShe finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban\non her head.\n\nBUTCH\nI didn't call you a Mongoloid, I\ncalled you a retard, but I took it\nback.\n\nShe hands him a towel.\n\nBUTCH\nMerci beaucoup.\n\nFABIENNE\nButch?\n\nBUTCH\n(drying his head)\nYes, lemon pie.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhere are we going to go?\n\nBUTCH\nI'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.\nWe're gonna get a lot of money from\nthis. But it ain't gonna be so much,\nwe can live like hogs in the fat\nhouse forever. I was thinking we\ncould go somewhere in the South\nPacific. The kinda money we'll have'll\ncarry us a long way down there.\n\nFABIENNE\nSo if we wanted, we could live in\nBora Bora?\n\nBUTCH\nYou betcha. And if after awhile you\ndon't dig Bora Bora, then we can\nmove over to Tahiti or Mexico.\n\nFABIENNE\nBut I do not speak Spanish.\n\nBUTCH\nYou don't speak Bora Boran either.\nBesides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta\nel zapataria?\n\nFABIENNE\nWhat does that mean?\n\nBUTCH\nWhere's the shoe store?\n\nFABIENNE\nDonde esta el zapataria?\n\nBUTCH\nExcellent pronunciation. You'll be\nmy little mama ceta in no time.\n\nButch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes\nher teeth.\n\nButch keeps on from the other room.\n\nBUTCH (O.S.)\nQue hora es?\n\nFABIENNE\nQue hora es?\n\nBUTCH (O.S.)\nWhat time is it?\n\nFABIENNE\nWhat time is it?\n\nBUTCH (O.S.)\nTime for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.\n\nFabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or\ntwo, then she remember something.\n\nFABIENNE\nButch.\n\nShe walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only\nto find him sound asleep in bed.\n\nShe looks at him for a moment.\n\nFABIENNE\nForget it.\n\nShe exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the\nWIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\nFADE UP:\n\nMOTEL ROOM \u2013 MORNING\n\nSAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still\nasleep in bed.\n\nFabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the\nbathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still\nwears the terry cloth robe from the night before.\n\nON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking\non the entire Vietnamese army in the film \"THE LOSERS\".\n\nButch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing\nhim.\n\nHis start startles Fabienne.\n\nFABIENNE\nMerde! You startled me. Did you have\na bad dream?\n\nButch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to\nfocus.\n\nButch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV\nHell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat are you watching?\n\nFABIENNE\nA motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the\nname.\n\nBUTCH\nAre you watchin' it?\n\nFabienne enters the room.\n\nFABIENNE\nIn a way. Why? Would you like for me\nto switch it off?\n\nBUTCH\nWould you please?\n\nShe reaches over and turns off the TV.\n\nBUTCH\nIt's a little too early in the morning\nfor explosions and war.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhat was it about?\n\nBUTCH\nHow should I know, you were the one\nwatchin' it.\n\nFabienne laughs.\n\nFABIENNE\nNo, imbecile, what was your dream\nabout?\n\nBUTCH\nOh, I... don't remember. It's really\nrare I remember a dream.\n\nFABIENNE\nYou just woke up from it.\n\nBUTCH\nFabienne, I'm not lying to you, I\ndon't remember.\n\nFABIENNE\nWell, let's look at the grumpy man\nin the morning. I didn't say you\nwere lying, it's just odd you don't\nremember your dreams. I always\nremember mine. Did you know you talk\nin your sleep?\n\nBUTCH\nI don't talk in my sleep, do I talk\nin my sleep?\n\nFABIENNE\nYou did last night.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat did I say?\n\nLaying on top of him.\n\nFABIENNE\nI don't know. I couldn't understand\nyou.\n\nShe kisses Butch.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhy don't you get up and we'll get\nsome breakfast at that breakfast\nplace with the pancakes.\n\nBUTCH\nOne more kiss and I'll get up.\n\nFabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.\n\nFABIENNE\nSatisfied?\n\nBUTCH\nYep.\n\nFABIENNE\nThen get up, lazy bones.\n\nButch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of\nthe suitcase that Fabienne brought.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat time is it?\n\nFABIENNE\nAlmost nine in the morning. What\ntime does our train arrive?\n\nBUTCH\nEleven.\n\nFABIENNE\nI'm gonna order a big plate of\nblueberry pancakes with maple syrup,\neggs over easy, and five sausages.\n\nBUTCH\n(surprised at her\npotential appetite)\nAnything to drink with that?\n\nButch is finished dressing.\n\nFABIENNE\n(referring to his\nclothes)\nOh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a\ntall glass or orange juice and a\nblack cup of coffee. After that, I'm\ngoing to have a slice of pie.\n\nAs he goes through the suitcase.\n\nBUTCH\nPie for breakfast?\n\nFABIENNE\nAny time of the day is a good time\nfor pie. Blueberry pie to go with\nthe pancakes. And on top, a thin\nslice of melted cheese \u2013\n\nBUTCH\n\u2013 where's my watch?\n\nFABIENNE\nIt's there.\n\nBUTCH\nNo, it's not. It's not here.\n\nFABIENNE\nHave you looked?\n\nBy now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.\n\nBUTCH\nYes I've fuckin' looked!!\n\nHe's now throwing clothes.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat the fuck do you think I'm doing?!\nAre you sure you got it?\n\nFabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.\n\nFABIENNE\nUhhh... yes... beside the table drawer\n\u2013\n\nBUTCH\n\u2013 on the little kangaroo.\n\nFABIENNE\nYes, it was on your little kangaroo.\n\nBUTCH\nWell it's not here!\n\nFABIENNE\n(on the verge of tears)\nWell it should be!\n\nBUTCH\nOh it most definitely should be here,\nbut it's not. So where is it?\n\nFabienne is crying and scared.\n\nButch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more\nmenacing.\n\nBUTCH\nFabienne, that was my father's fuckin'\nwatch. You know what my father went\nthrough to git me that watch?... I\ndon't wanna get into it right now...\nbut he went through a lot. Now all\nthis other shit, you coulda set on\nfire, but I specifically reminded\nyou not to forget my father's watch.\nNow think, did you get it?\n\nFABIENNE\nI believe so...\n\nBUTCH\nYou believe so? You either did, or\nyou didn't, now which one is it?\n\nFABIENNE\nThen I did.\n\nBUTCH\nAre you sure?\n\nFABIENNE\n(shaking)\nNo.\n\nButch freaks out, he punches the air.\n\nFabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the\nmotel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.\n\nFabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.\n\nButch looks toward her, suddenly calm.\n\nBUTCH\n(to Fabienne)\nNo! It's not your fault.\n(he approached her)\nYou left it at the apartment.\n\nHe bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.\n\nHe touches her hand, she flinches.\n\nBUTCH\nIf you did leave it at the apartment,\nit's not your fault. I had you bring\na bunch of stuff. I reminded you\nabout it, but I didn't illustrate\nhow personal the watch was to me. If\nall I gave a fuck about was my watch,\nI should've told you. You ain't a\nmind reader.\n\nHe kisses her hand. Then rises.\n\nFabienne is still sniffling.\n\nButch goes to the closet.\n\nFABIENNE\nI'm sorry.\n\nButch puts on his high school jacket.\n\nBUTCH\nDon't be. It just means I won't be\nable to eat breakfast with you.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhy does it mean that?\n\nBUTCH\nBecause I'm going back to my apartment\nto get my watch.\n\nFABIENNE\nWon't the gangsters be looking for\nyou there?\n\nBUTCH\nThat's what I'm gonna find out. If\nthey are, and I don't think I can\nhandle it, I'll split.\n\nRising from the floor.\n\nFABIENNE\nI was so dreadful. I saw your watch,\nI thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.\n\nButch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.\n\nBUTCH\nDon't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing\nyou could ever do would make me\npermanently angry at you.\n(pause)\nI love you, remember?\n(he digs some money\nout of his wallet)\nNow here's some money, order those\npancakes and have a great breakfast.\n\nFABIENNE\nDon't go.\n\nBUTCH\nI'll be back before you can say,\nblueberry pie.\n\nFABIENNE\nBlueberry pie.\n\nBUTCH\nWell maybe not that fast, but fast.\nOkay?  Okay?\n\nFABIENNE\nOkay.\n\nHe kisses her once more and heads for the door.\n\nBUTCH\nBye-bye, sugar pop.\n\nFABIENNE\nBye.\n\nBUTCH\nI'm gonna take your Honda.\n\nFABIENNE\nOkay.\n\nAnd with that, he's out the door.\n\nFabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.\n\nINT. HONDA (MOVING) \u2013 DAY\n\nButch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his\nfists as he drives down the street.\n\nBUTCH\nOf all the fuckin' things she coulda\nforgot, she forgets my father's watch.\nI specifically reminded her not to\nforget it. \"Bedside table \u2013 on the\nkangaroo.\" I said the words: \"Don't\nforget my father's watch.\"\n\nEXT. CITY STREET \u2013 DAY\n\nThe little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is\nlittle engine will take it.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nA parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the\narrow pointing at one hour.\n\nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER \u2013 DAY\n\nButch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a\ncouple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before\nhe goes boppin' through the front door.\n\nEXT. ALLEY \u2013 DAY\n\nButch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,\nthen he discreetly glances out.\n\nEXT. STREET \u2013 BUTCH'S APARTMENT \u2013 DAY\n\nEverything seems normal. More or less the right number of\ncars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of\nplace. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.\nBasically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of\nButch's home.\n\nButch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.\n\nButch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He\ncrosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.\n\nAcross the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a\ncombination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign\nsticks up in the air, with the name \"Teriyaki Donut\" and a\ngraphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.\n\nEXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD \u2013 DAY\n\nButch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment\nbuilding. Once again, everything appears normal \u2013 the laundry\nroom, the pool, his apartment door \u2013 nothing appears\ndisturbed.\n\nButch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.\nHe steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.\n\nButch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening\nit.\n\nINT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT \u2013 DAY\n\nHis apartment hasn't been touched.\n\nHe cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick\nlook around. Obviously, no one is there.\n\nButch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the\nrefrigerator.\n\nHe takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.\n\nWith carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he\ngoes to the bedroom.\n\nHis bedroom is like the rest of the apartment \u2013 neat, clean\nand anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a\nfew boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue\nof \"Ring Magazine\" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of\nJerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.\n\nSure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On\nthe bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.\n\nHe walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He\nopens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting\ndown the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and\nputs them in the toaster.\n\nButch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.\n\nWhat he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun\nwith a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.\n\nBUTCH\n(softly)\nHoly shit.\n\nHe picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines\nit.\n\nThen... a toilet FLUSHES.\n\nButch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to\nthe kitchen. There is someone behind it.\n\nLike a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not\nknowing what to do.\n\nThe bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the\nbathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book\n\"MODESTY BLAISE\" by Peter O'Donnell.\n\nVincent and Butch lock eyes.\n\nVincent freezes.\n\nButch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's\ndirection.\n\nNeither man opens his mouth.\n\nThen... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.\n\nThat's all the situation needed.\n\nButch's finger HITS the trigger.\n\nMUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.\n\nVincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets\nSIMULTANEOUSLY \u2013 LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him\nthrough the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door\nat the end of the bathroom.\n\nBy the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent\nis annihilated.\n\nButch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look\ngoes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once\nVincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.\n\nWith the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61\nback on the kitchen counter.\n\nThen he exits the apartment, quickly.\n\nEXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD \u2013 DAY\n\nButch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the\ncourtyard...\n\n...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...\n\n...goes through the alley...\n\n...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.\n\nEXT. HONDA \u2013 DAY\n\nButch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide\nsmile of a survivor breaks across his face.\n\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET \u2013 DAY\n\nThe Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his\napartment building.\n\nINT. HONDA \u2013 DAY\n\nButch looks out the window at his former home.\n\nBUTCH\nThat's how you're gonna beat 'em,\nButch.  They keep underestimatin'\nya.\n\nThis makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips\na tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he\nSINGS along with it.\n\nHe drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on\nthe corner across from Teriyaki Donut.\n\nButch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we\nsee:\n\nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\n\nThe big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,\ncarrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam\ncups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street\nin front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see\nMarsellus clearly.\n\nLaughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front\nof him.\n\nWhen Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances\nto his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!\n\nDOUBLE-TAKE: \"Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?\"\n\nButch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.\nHe STOMPS on the gas pedal.\n\nThe little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts\nand the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.\n\nButch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold\nCamaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending\nit up on the sidewalk.\n\nButch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what\nat one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his\nnostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play.\nA PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.\n\nPEDESTRIAN\nJesus, are you okay?\n\nButch look at him, spaced-out.\n\nBUTCH\nI guess.\n\nMarsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS\ngather around the body.\n\nGAWKER #1\n(to the others)\nHe's dead! He's dead!\n\nThis jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.\n\nTWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.\n\nThe woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.\n\nGAWKER #2\nIf you need a witness in court, I'll\nbe glad to help. He was a drunken\nmaniac. He hit you and crashed into\nthat car.\n\nMARSELLUS\n(still incoherent)\nWho?\n\nGAWKER #2\n(pointing at Butch)\nHim.\n\nMarsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge\ndown the street, looking a shambles.\n\nMARSELLUS\nWell, I'll be damned.\n\nThe big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back\naway.\n\nMarsellus starts moving toward Butch.\n\nButch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward\nhim.\n\nBUTCH\nSacre bleu.\n\nMarsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,\nshaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.\n\nHe HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,\nscreaming.\n\nLOOKY-LOO WOMAN\nOh my God, I've been shot!\n\nThat's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.\n\nMarsellus RUNS after him.\n\nThe CROWD looks agape.\n\nButch is in a mad, limping RUN.\n\nThe big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.\n\nButch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a\nsign that reads \"MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP\".\n\nINT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP \u2013 DAY\n\nMAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter\nof his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of\nButch RACES into his world.\n\nMAYNARD\nCan I help you wit' somethin'?\n\nBUTCH\nShut up!\n\nButch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands\nnext to the door.\n\nMAYNARD\nNow you just wait one goddamn minute\n\u2013\n\nBefore Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.\nHe doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist\nin Marsellus' face.\n\nThe gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man\nFALLS FLAT on his back.\n\nOutside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.\n\nButch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in\nthe face.\n\nButch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold\nof his middle finger.\n\nBUTCH\nSo you like chasing people, huh?\n\nHe BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch\nthen places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS\nback the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to\nshield the splatter.\n\nBUTCH\nWell guess what, big man, you caught\nme \u2013\n\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\n\u2013 hold it right there, godammit!\n\nButch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a\npumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.\n\nBUTCH\nLook mister, this ain't any of your\nbusiness \u2013\n\nMAYNARD\n\u2013 I'm makin' it my business! Now\ntoss that gun!\n\nButch does.\n\nMAYNARD\nNow you on top, stand up and come to\nthe counter.\n\nButch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he\ngets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face\nwith the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.\n\nAfter Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on\nthe counter and moves to the telephone.\n\nMarsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily\nwatches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on\nthe line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.\n\nMAYNARD\nZed? It's Maynard. The spider just\ncaught a coupl'a flies.\n\nMarsellus passes out.\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\nFADE UP:\n\nINT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nTWO SHOT \u2013 BUTCH AND MARSELLUS\n\nThey are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are\ntwo S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and\na little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are\nunconscious.\n\nMaynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both\nguys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two\nprisoners look up at their captors.\n\nMaynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one\nhand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in\nhis belt.\n\nMAYNARD\nNobody kills anybody in my place of\nbusiness except me or Zed.\n\nA BUZZER buzzes.\n\nMAYNARD\nThat's Zed.\n\nWithout saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs\nthat lead to red curtains and goes through them.\n\nWE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed\ninside the store.\n\nButch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of\nthe pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking\nin their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,\nall traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both\nshare at what they've gotten themselves into.\n\nMaynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even\nmore intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.\nThe two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is\na vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and\nstands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a\nlong time, then says:\n\nZED\n(to Maynard)\nYou said you waited for me?\n\nMAYNARD\nI did.\n\nZED\nThen how come they're all beat up?\n\nMAYNARD\nThey did that to each other. They\nwas fightin' when they came in. This\none was gonna shoot that one.\n\nZED\n(to Butch)\nYou were gonna shoot him?\n\nButch makes no reply.\n\nZED\nHey, is Grace gonna be okay in front\nof this place?\n\nMAYNARD\nYeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?\n\nZED\nNo, it's Thursday.\n\nMAYNARD\nThen she'll be fine.\n\nZED\nBring out The Gimp.\n\nMAYNARD\nI think The Gimp's sleepin'.\n\nZED\nWell, I guess you'll just wake 'em\nup then, won't you?\n\nMaynard opens a trap door in the floor.\n\nMAYNARD\n(yelling in the hole)\nWake up!\n\nMaynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a\nleash.\n\nHe gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises\nTHE GIMP.\n\nThe Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black\nleather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs\nhere and there on the body. On his head is a black leather\nmask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth.\nThey keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large\ndog.\n\nZed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,\nthen lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed,\nthen backs away.\n\nMAYNARD\n(to The Gimp)\nDown!\n\nThe Gimp gets on its knees.\n\nMaynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.\n\nMAYNARD\nWho's first?\n\nZED\nI ain't fer sure yet.\n\nThen with his little finger, Zed does a silent \"Eenie, meany,\nminey, moe... \" just his mouth mouthing the words and his\nfinger going back and forth between the two.\n\nButch are Marsellus are terrified.\n\nMaynard looks back and forth at the victims.\n\nThe Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.\n\nZed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving\nleft to right, then it stops.\n\nTWO SHOT \u2013 BUTCH AND MARSELLUS\n\nAfter a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on\nMarsellus.\n\nZed stands up.\n\nZED\nWanna do it here?\n\nMAYNARD\nNaw, drag big boy to Russell's old\nroom.\n\nZed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old\nroom.\n\nRussell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the\nmisfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop.\nWhatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and\nZed because his old room, a back room in the back of the\nback room, is empty.\n\nAs Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before\nhe disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.\n\nMAYNARD\n(to The Gimp)\nUp!\n\nThe Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on\nthe ceiling.\n\nMAYNARD\nKeep an eye on this one.\n\nThe Gimp bows its head: \"yes.\" Maynard disappears into\nRussell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because\nsuddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.\n\nButch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath\nthe mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history\nof comedy.\n\nFrom behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:\n\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\nWhoa, this boy's got a bit of fight\nin 'em!\n\nWe the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.\n\nZED (O.S.)\nYou wanna fight? You wanna fight?\nGood, I like to fight!\n\nButch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic,\nhurriedly struggles to get free.\n\nThe Gimp is laughing wildly.\n\nThe ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.\n\nThe Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:\n\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\nThat's it... that's it boy, you're\ngoin' fine. Oooooooh, just like\nthat... that's good.\n(grunting faster)\nStay still... stay still goddamn ya!\nZed goddammit, git over here and\nhold 'em!\n\nButch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite\neasily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it\nwere never connected by a bolt.\n\nThe Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.\n\nTHE GIMP\nHuhng?\n\nThe Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook.\nHe tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles\nand grunts.\n\nButch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S\nPUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making\nhim fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash\nattached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then\nsilently makes his way through the red curtains.\n\nINT. PAWNSHOP \u2013 DAY\n\nButch sneaks to the door.\n\nOn the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected\nto the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he\nstops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their\nway with Marsellus.\n\nButch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in\na situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the\npawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in\nwith.\n\nHe picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards\nit: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks\nabout it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large\nLouisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots\nwhat he's been looking for:\n\nA Samurai sword.\n\nIt hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the\nwall, next to a neon \"DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER\" sign.\nButch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its\nsheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten\nin the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his\nthumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not\non your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems\nmade to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the\nsword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears\nthrough the red curtains to take care of business.\n\nINT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nButch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.\n\nSodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind\nthe closed door that leads to Russell's old room.\n\nINT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nButch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It\nswings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched\npositions.\n\nZed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden\nhorse.\n\nMaynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.\n\nMaynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up\nbehind him with the sword.\n\nMiserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus,\nred ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see\nButch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.\n\nBUTCH\nHey hillbilly.\n\nMaynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.\n\nButch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across\nthe front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on\nZed.\n\nMaynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.\n\nButch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword\nbehind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing\nthe blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.\n\nZed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go\nfrom the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic,\nwhich lies within reach.\n\nButch's eyes follow Zed's.\n\nBUTCH\nYou want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.\n\nZed's hand inches toward the weapon.\n\nButch GRIPS the sword tighter.\n\nZed studies Butch.\n\nButch looks hard at Zed.\n\nThen a VOICE says:\n\nMARSELLUS (O.S.)\nStep aside, Butch.\n\nButch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,\nholding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.\n\nKABOOM!!!!\n\nZed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.\n\nMarsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the\nused shotgun shell.\n\nButch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:\n\nBUTCH\nYou okay?\n\nMARSELLUS\nNaw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from\nokay!\n\nLong pause.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat now?\n\nMARSELLUS\nWhat now? Well let me tell you what\nnow.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-\nhittin' niggers, who'll go to work\non homes here with a pair of pliers\nand a blow torch.\n(to Zed)\nHear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I\nain't through with you by a damn\nsight. I'm gonna git Medieval on\nyour ass.\n\nBUTCH\nI meant what now, between me and\nyou?\n\nMARSELLUS\nOh, that what now? Well, let me tell\nya what now between me an' you. There\nis no me an' you. Not no more.\n\nBUTCH\nSo we're cool?\n\nMARSELLUS\nYeah man, we're cool. One thing I\nask \u2013 two things I ask: Don't tell\nnobody about this. This shit's between\nme and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-\nthe-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-\nagonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It\nain't nobody else's business. Two:\nleave town. Tonight. Right now. And\nwhen you're gone, stay gone.  You've\nlost your Los Angeles privileges.\nDeal?\n\nBUTCH\nDeal.\n\nThe two men shake hands, then hug one another.\n\nMARSELLUS\nGo on now, get your ass outta here.\n\nButch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.\n\nMarsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.\n\nMARSELLUS\n(into the phone)\nHello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta\nbit of a situation.\n\nEXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP \u2013 DAY\n\nButch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He\nlooks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment,\nZed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has\nthe name \"GRACE\" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys\nwith the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES\nto life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.\nButch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.\n\nWE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...\n\nINT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nFabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a \"Frankie says,\nRelax\" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a\nBOOM BOX.\n\nEXT. CITY STREET \u2013 CHOPPER (MOVING) \u2013 DAY\n\nButch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named \"GRACE.\"\nHe checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.\n\nThe SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.\n\nEXT. MOTEL ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nButch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the\nmotel room, while we stay outside with the bike.\n\nFABIENNE (O.S.)\nButch, I was so worried!\n\nBUTCH\nHoney, grab your radio and your purse\nand let's go!\n\nFABIENNE (O.S.)\nBut what about all our bags?\n\nBUTCH\nFuck the bags.

I'll wait\nfor you outside.\n\nButch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the\nmotel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she\nsees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhere did you get this motorcycle?\n\nBUTCH\n(he kick-starts it)\nIt's a chopper, baby, hop on.\n\nFabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhat happened to my Honda?\n\nBUTCH\nSorry baby, I crashed the Honda.\n\nFABIENNE\nYou're hurt?\n\nBUTCH\nI might've broke my nose, no biggie.\nHop on.\n\nShe doesn't move.\n\nButch looks at her.\n\nBUTCH\nHoney, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!\n\nFabienne starts to cry.\n\nButch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the\nbike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her\nhand.\n\nBUTCH\nI'm sorry, baby-love.\n\nFABIENNE\n(crying)\nYou were gone so long, I started to\nthink dreadful thoughts.\n\nBUTCH\nI'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.\nEverything's fine. Hey, how was\nbreakfast?\n\nFABIENNE\n(waterworks drying a\nlittle)\nIt was good \u2013\n\nBUTCH\n\u2013 did you get the blueberry pancakes?\n\nFABIENNE\nNo, they didn't have blueberry\npancakes, I had to get buttermilk \u2013\nare you sure you're okay?\n\nBUTCH\nBaby-love, from the moment I left\nyou, this has been without a doubt\nthe single weirdest day of my entire\nlife.

BATHROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nWe're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in\nearlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except\nthis time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The\nFourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard\nto what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly\nCLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.\n\nJULES (O.S.)\n\"...blessed is he who, in the name\nof charity and good will, shepherded\nthe weak through the valley of\ndarkness.

He THROWS himself against the\nback wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow\nfear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough\nto stick their head through that door.\n\nThen he listens to them talk.\n\nVINCENT (O.S.)\nFriend of yours?\n\nJULES (O.S.)\nYeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.\n\nWaiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the\ndoor and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around\nis the way to go.\n\nINT. APARTMENT \u2013 DAY\n\nThe bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES\nout, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his\nhand cannon.\n\nFOURTH MAN\nDie... die... die... die...!\n\nDOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.\n\nHe SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion\ncrosses his face.\n\nTWO SHOT \u2013 JULES AND VINCENT\n\nStanding next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems,\nnone of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody.\nJules and Vincent exchange looks like, \"Are we hit?\" They're\nas confused at the shooter. After looking at each other,\nthey bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.\n\nFOURTH MAN\nI don't understand \u2013\n\nThe Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's\nbullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.\n\nThe two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits\ndown in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs\nit off.\n\nThen heads toward Marvin in the corner.\n\nVINCENT\nWhy the fuck didn't you tell us about\nthat guy in the bathroom? Slip your\nmind?  Forget he was in there with a\ngoddamn hand cannon?\n\nJULES\n(to himself)\nWe should be fuckin' dead right now.\n(pause)\nDid you see that gun he fired at us?\nIt was bigger than him.\n\nVINCENT\n.357.\n\nJULES\nWe should be fuckin' dead!\n\nVINCENT\nYeah, we were lucky.\n\nJules rises, moving toward Vincent.\n\nJULES\nThat shit wasn't luck. That shit was\nsomethin' else.\n\nVincent prepares to leave.\n\nVINCENT\nYeah, maybe.\n\nJULES\nThat was... divine intervention. You\nknow what divine intervention is?\n\nVINCENT\nYeah, I think so.

Don't blow this shit off!\nWhat just happened was a fuckin'\nmiracle!\n\nVINCENT\nChill the fuck out, Jules, this shit\nhappens.\n\nJULES\nWrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just\nhappen.\n\nVINCENT\nDo you wanna continue this theological\ndiscussion in the car, or at the\njailhouse with the cops?\n\nJULES\nWe should be fuckin' dead now, my\nfriend!

HOTEL SUITE \u2013 MORNING\n\nThe CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite\ninto the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a\nfancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in\nfancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing:\nSitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the\ntuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka \"THE WOLF\". We also see The\nWolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.\n\nTHE WOLF\n(into phone)\nIs she the hysterical type?\n(pause)\nWhen she due?\n(jotting down)\nGive me the principals' names again?\n(jots down)\nJules...\n\nWe SEE his book. The page has written on it:\n\n\"1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head)\nBloody shot-up car Jules (black)\"\n\nTHE WOLF\n...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...\n\nHE WRITES:\n\n\"Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)\"\n\nTHE WOLF\nExpect a call around 10:30. It's\nabout thirty minutes away. I'll be\nthere in ten.\n\nHe hangs up. We never see his face.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nTITLE CARD OVER BLACK:\n\n\"NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER\"\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. JIMMIE'S STREET \u2013 MORNING\n\nA silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home,\nin HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a\ndime in front of Jimmie's house.\n\nA ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.\n\nINT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE \u2013 MORNING\n\nJimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the\ntuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at\nJimmie.\n\nTHE WOLF\nYou're Jimmie, right? This is your\nhouse?\n\nJIMMIE\nYeah.\n\nTHE WOLF\n(stick his hand out)\nI'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.\n\nJIMMIE\nGood, 'cause we got one.\n\nTHE WOLF\nSo I heard. May I come in?\n\nJIMMIE\nPlease do.\n\nIn the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.\n\nTHE WOLF\nYou must be Jules, which would make\nyou Vincent. Let's get down to brass\ntacks, gentlemen. If I was informed\ncorrectly, the clock is ticking, is\nthat right, Jimmie?\n\nJIMMIE\n100%.\n\nTHE WOLF\nYour wife, Bonnie...\n(refers to his pad)\n...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is\nthat correct?\n\nJIMMIE\nUh-huh.\n\nTHE WOLF\nI was led to believe if she comes\nhome and finds us here, she wouldn't\nappreciate it none too much.\n\nJIMMIE\nShe won't at that.\n\nTHE WOLF\nThat gives us forty minutes to get\nthe fuck outta Dodge, which, if you\ndo what I say when I say it, should\nby plenty. Now you got a corpse in a\ncar, minus a head, in a garage. Take\nme to it.\n\nINT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE \u2013 MORNING\n\nThe three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He\nstudies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside,\ncircling it.\n\nTHE WOLF\nJimmie?\n\nJIMMIE\nYes.\n\nTHE WOLF\nDo me a favor, will ya? Thought I\nsmelled some coffee in there. Would\nyou make me a cup?\n\nJIMMIE\nSure, how do you take it?\n\nTHE WOLF\nLotsa cream, lotsa sugar.\n\nJimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.\n\nTHE WOLF\nAbout the car, is there anything I\nneed to know? Does it stall, does it\nmake a lot of noise, does it smoke,\nis there gas in it, anything?\n\nJULES\nAside from how it looks, the car's\ncool.\n\nTHE WOLF\nPositive?  Don't get me out on the\nroad and I find out the brake lights\ndon't work.\n\nJULES\nHey man, as far as I know, the\nmotherfucker's tip-top.\n\nTHE WOLF\nGood enough, let's go back to the\nkitchen.\n\nINT. KITCHEN \u2013 MORNING\n\nJimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.\n\nTHE WOLF\nThank you, Jimmie.\n\nHe takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the\nthree men the plan of action.\n\nTHE WOLF\nOkay first thing, you two.\n(meaning Jules and\nVincent)\nTake the body, stick it in the trunk.\nNow Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty\ndomesticated house. That would lead\nme to believe that in the garage or\nunder the sink, you got a bunch of\ncleansers and cleaners and shit like\nthat, am I correct?\n\nJIMMIE\nYeah. Exactly. Under the sink.\n\nTHE WOLF\nGood. What I need you two fellas to\ndo is take those cleaning products\nand clean the inside of the car. And\nI'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You\nneed to go in the backseat, scoop up\nall those little pieces of brain and\nskull. Get it out of there.  Wipe\ndown the upholstery \u2013 now when it\ncomes to upholstery, it don't need\nto be spic and span, you don't need\nto eat off it. Give it a good once\nover. What you need to take care of\nare the really messy parts. The pools\nof blood that have collected, you\ngotta soak that shit up.  But the\nwindows are a different story.  Them\nyou really clean. Get the Windex, do\na good job. Now Jimmie, we need to\nraid your linen closet. I need\nblankets, I need comforters, I need\nquilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker\nthe better, the darker the better.\nNo whites, can't use 'em. We need to\ncamouflage the interior of the car.\nWe're gonna line the front seat and\nthe backseat and the floor boards\nwith quilts and blankets. If a cop\nstops us and starts stickin' his big\nsnout in the car, the subterfuge\nwon't last. But at a glance, the car\nwill appear to be normal.  Jimmie \u2013\nlead the way, boys \u2013 get to work.\n\nThe Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving\nVincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.\n\nVINCENT\n(calling after him)\nA \"please\" would be nice.\n\nThe Wolf stops and turns around.\n\nTHE WOLF\nCome again?\n\nVINCENT\nI said a \"please\" would be nice.\n\nThe Wolf takes a step toward him.\n\nTHE WOLF\nSet is straight, Buster. I'm not\nhere to say \"please.\"I'm here to\ntell you want to do. And if self-\npreservation is an instinct you\npossess, you better fuckin' do it\nand do it quick. I'm here to help.\nIf my help's not appreciated, lotsa\nluck gentlemen.\n\nJULES\nIt ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your\nhelp is definitely appreciated.\n\nVINCENT\nI don't mean any disrespect. I just\ndon't like people barkin' orders at\nme.\n\nTHE WOLF\nIf I'm curt with you, it's because\ntime is a factor. I think fast, I\ntalk fast, and I need you guys to\nact fast if you want to get out of\nthis. So pretty please, with sugar\non top, clean the fuckin' car.\n\nINT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM \u2013 MORNING\n\nJimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he\nhas.\n\nThe Wolf is on the phone.\n\nTHE WOLF\n(into phone)\nIt's a 1974 Chevy Nova.\n(pause)\nWhite.\n(pause)\nNothin', except for the mess inside.\n(pause)\nAbout twenty minutes.\n(pause)\nNobody who'll be missed.\n(pause)\nYou're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.\n(he looks at Jimmie)\nHow we comin', Jimmie?\n\nJimmie comes over with a handful of linen.\n\nJIMMIE\nMr. Wolf, you gotta understand\nsomethin' \u2013\n\nTHE WOLF\n\u2013 Winston, Jimmie \u2013 please, Winston.\n\nJIMMIE\nYou gotta understand something,\nWinston. I want to help you guys out\nand all, but that's my best linen.\nIt was a wedding present from my\nUncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and\nthey ain't with us anymore \u2013\n\nTHE WOLF\n\u2013 let me ask you a question, if you\ndon't mind?\n\nJIMMIE\nSure.\n\nTHE WOLF\nWere you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny\nmillionaires?\n\nJIMMIE\nNo.\n\nTHE WOLF\nWell, your Uncle Marsellus is. And\nI'm positive if Uncle Conrad and\nAunt Ginny were millionaires, they\nwould've furnished you with a whole\nbedroom set, which your Uncle\nMarsellus is more than happy to do.\n(takes out a roll of\nbills)\nI like oak myself, that's what's in\nmy bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie,\nyou an oak man?\n\nJIMMIE\nOak's nice.\n\nINT. GARAGE \u2013 MORNING\n\nBoth Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up.\nVincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is\nin the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs\nof brain.\n\nBoth are twice as bloody as they were before.\n\nJULES\nI will never forgive your ass for\nthis shit. This is some fucked-up\nrepugnant shit!\n\nVINCENT\nDid you ever hear the philosophy\nthat once a man admits he's wrong,\nhe's immediately forgiven for all\nwrong-doings?\n\nJULES\nMan, get outta my face with that\nshit! The motherfucker who said that\nnever had to pick up itty-bitty pieces\nof skull with his fingers on account\nof your dumb ass.\n\nVINCENT\nI got a threshold, Jules. I got a\nthreshold for the abuse I'll take.\nAnd you're crossin' it. I'm a race\ncar and you got me in the red. Redline\n7000, that's where you are. Just\nknow, it's fuckin' dangerous to be\ndrivin' a race car when it's in the\nred. It could blow.\n\nJULES\nYou're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a\nmushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!\nEvery time my fingers touch brain\nI'm \"SUPERFLY T.N.T,\" I'm the \"GUNS\nOF NAVARONE.\" I'm what Jimmie Walker\nusta talk about. In fact, what the\nfuck am I doin' in the back?  You're\nthe motherfucker should be on brain\ndetail. We're tradin'. I'm washin'\nwindows and you're pickin' up this\nnigger's skull.\n\nINT. CHEVY NOVA \u2013 MORNING\n\nThe interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with\nbedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a\nportable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript\nvehicle.\n\nThe Wolf circles the car examining it.\n\nJules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a\nbloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a\ngood job they've done.\n\nTHE WOLF\nFine job, gentlemen. We may get out\nof this yet.\n\nJIMMIE\nI can't believe that's the same car.\n\nTHE WOLF\nWell, let's not start suckin' each\nother's dicks quite yet. Phase one\nis complete, clean the car, which\nmoves us right along to phase two,\nclean you two.\n\nEXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD \u2013 MORNING\n\nJules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits,\ncovered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic\nHefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one\nof those guns nozzles attached.\n\nTHE WOLF\nStrip.\n\nVINCENT\nAll the way?\n\nTHE WOLF\nTo your bare ass.\n\nAs they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.\n\nTHE WOLF\nQuickly gentlemen, we got about\nfifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-\nhalf comes pulling into the driveway.\n\nJULES\nThis morning air is some chilly shit.\n\nVINCENT\nAre you sure this is absolutely\nnecessary?\n\nTHE WOLF\nYou know what you two look like?\n\nVINCENT\nWhat?\n\nTHE WOLF\nLike a couple of guys who just blew\noff somebody's head. Yes, strippin'\noff those bloody rags is absolutely\nnecessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's\ngarbage bag.\n\nJULES\nNow Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid\nlike puttin' that out in front of\nyour house for Elmo the garbage man\nto take away.\n\nTHE WOLF\nDon't worry, we're takin' it with\nus. Jim, the soap.\n\nHe hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.\n\nTHE WOLF\nOkay gentlemen, you're both been to\nCounty before, I'm sure. Here it\ncomes.\n\nHe hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.\n\nJULES\nGoddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!\n\nTHE WOLF\nBetter you than me, gentlemen.\n\nThe two men, trembling, scrub themselves.\n\nTHE WOLF\nDon't be afraid of the soap, spread\nit around.\n\nThe Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.\n\nTHE WOLF\nTowel 'em.\n\nJimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously\nacross their bodies.\n\nTHE WOLF\nYou're dry enough, give 'em their\nclothes.\n\nFADE UP ON:\n\nJULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They\nlook a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses\nwe first met.\n\nTHE WOLF\nPerfect. Perfect. We couldn't've\nplanned this better. You guys look\nlike... what do they look like,\nJimmie?\n\nJIMMIE\nDorks. They look like a couple of\ndorks.\n\nThe Wolf and Jimmie laugh.\n\nJULES\nHa ha ha. They're your clothes,\nmotherfucker.\n\nJIMMIE\nI guess you just gotta know how to\nwear them.\n\nJULES\nYeah, well, our asses ain't the expert\non wearin' dorky shit that your is.\n\nTHE WOLF\nC'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and\njokin' our way into prison.

JIMMIE'S GARAGE \u2013 MORNING\n\nThe garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin.\nThe Wolf SLAMS is closed.\n\nTHE WOLF\nGentlemen, let's get our rules of\nthe road straight. We're going to a\nplace called Monster Joe's Truck and\nTow. Monster Joe and his daughter\nRaquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.\nThe place is North Hollywood, so a\nfew twist and turns aside, we'll be\ngoin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll\ndrive the tainted car. Jules, you\nride with me.  Vincent, you follow\nin my Porsche. Now if we cross the\npath of any John Q. Laws, nobody\ndoes a fuckin' thing 'til I do\nsomething.\n\n(TO JULES)\nWhat did I say?\n\nJULES\nDon't do shit unless \u2013\n\nTHE WOLF\n\u2013 unless what?\n\nJULES\nUnless you do it first.\n\nTHE WOLF\nSpoken like a true prodigy.\n(to Vincent)\nHow 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you\nkeep your spurs from jingling and\njangling?\n\nVINCENT\nI'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went\noff, I dunno how.\n\nTHE WOLF\nFair enough.\n(he throws Vince his\ncar keys)\nI drive real fuckin' fast, so keep\nup.

MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW \u2013 MORNING\n\nJules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.\n\nJULES\nWe cool?\n\nWINSTON\nLike it never happened.\n\nJules and Vincent bump fists.\n\nWINSTON\nBoys, this is Raquel. Someday, all\nthis will be hers.\n\nRAQUEL\n(to the boys)\nHi. You know, if they ever do \"I\nSPY: THE MOTION PICTURE,\" you guys,\nI'd be great.  What's with the\noutfits. You guys going to a\nvolleyball game?\n\nWinston laughs, the boys groan.\n\nWINSTON\nI'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.\nMaybe I can drop you two off. Where\ndo you live?\n\nVINCENT\nRedondo Beach.\n\nJULES\nInglewood.\n\nWinston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a\n\"DEAD ZONE\" trance.\n\nWINSTON\n(painfully)\nIt's your future: I see... a cab\nride.\n(dropping the act)\nSorry guys, move out of the sticks.\n(to Raquel)\nSay goodbye, Raquel.\n\nRAQUEL\nGoodbye, Raquel.\n\nWINSTON\nI'll see you two around, and stay\noutta trouble, you crazy kids.\n\nWinston turns to leave.\n\nJULES\nMr. Wolf.\n\nHe turns around.\n\nJULES\nI was a pleasure watchin' you work.\n\nThe Wolf smiles.\n\nWINSTON\nCall me Winston.\n\nHe turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.\n\nWINSTON\nYou hear that, young lady? Respect.\nYou could lean a lot from those two\nfine specimens. Respect for one's\nelders shows character.\n\nRAQUEL\nI have character.\n\nWINSTON\nJust because you are a character\ndoesn't mean you have character.\n\nRAQUEL\nOh you're so funny, oh you're so\nfunny.\n\nThe Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.\n\nThe two men left alone look at each other.\n\nJULES\nWanna share a cab?\n\nVINCENT\nYou know I could go for some\nbreakfast.  Want to have breakfast\nwith me?\n\nJULES\nSure.\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP \u2013 MORNING\n\nJules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a\nbig stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto.\nJules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a\nmuffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a\nrefill for both men,\n\nVINCENT\nThanks a bunch.\n(to Jules, who's\nnursing his coffee)\nWant a sausage?\n\nJULES\nNaw, I don't eat pork.\n\nVINCENT\nAre you Jewish?\n\nJULES\nI ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig\non swine.\n\nVINCENT\nWhy not?\n\nJULES\nThey're filthy animals. I don't eat\nfilthy animals.\n\nVINCENT\nSausages taste good. Pork chops taste\ngood.\n\nJULES\nA sewer rat may taste like pumpkin\npie.  I'll never know 'cause even if\nit did, I wouldn't eat the filthy\nmotherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in\nshit. That's a filthy animal. I don't\nwanna eat nothin' that ain't got\nenough sense to disregard its own\nfeces.\n\nVINCENT\nHow about dogs? Dogs eat their own\nfeces.\n\nJULES\nI don't eat dog either.\n\nVINCENT\nYes, but do you consider a dog to be\na filthy animal?\n\nJULES\nI wouldn't go so far as to call a\ndog filthy, but they're definitely\ndirty. But a dog's got personality.\nAnd personality goes a long way.\n\nVINCENT\nSo by that rationale, if a pig had a\nbetter personality, he's cease to be\na filthy animal?\n\nJULES\nWe'd have to be talkin' 'bout one\nmotherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd\nhave to be the Cary Grant of pigs.\n\nThe two men laugh.\n\nVINCENT\nGood for you. Lighten up a little.\nYou been sittin' there all quiet.\n\nJULES\nI just been sittin' here thinkin'.\n\nVINCENT\n(mouthful of food)\nAbout what?\n\nJULES\nThe miracle we witnessed.\n\nVINCENT\nThe miracle you witnessed. I witnessed\na freak occurrence.\n\nJULES\nDo you know that a miracle is?\n\nVINCENT\nAn act of God.\n\nJULES\nWhat's an act of God?\n\nVINCENT\nI guess it's when God makes the\nimpossible possible. And I'm sorry\nJules, but I don't think what happened\nthis morning qualifies.\n\nJULES\nDon't you see, Vince, that shit don't\nmatter. You're judging this thing\nthe wrong way. It's not about what.\nIt could be God stopped the bullets,\nhe changed Coke into Pepsi, he found\nmy fuckin' car keys. You don't judge\nshit like this based on merit. Whether\nor not what we experienced was an\naccording-to-Hoyle miracle is\ninsignificant. What is significant\nis I felt God's touch, God got\ninvolved.\n\nVINCENT\nBut why?\n\nJULES\nThat's what's fuckin' wit' me! I\ndon't know why. But I can't go back\nto sleep.\n\nVINCENT\nSo you're serious, you're really\ngonna quit?\n\nJULES\nThe life, most definitely.\n\nVincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In\nthe b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.\n\nPATRON\nGarcon! Coffee!\n\nWe recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene\nof Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.\n\nVINCENT\nSo if you're quitting the life,\nwhat'll you do?\n\nJULES\nThat's what I've been sitting here\ncontemplating. First, I'm gonna\ndeliver this case to Marsellus. Then,\nbasically, I'm gonna walk the earth.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat do you mean, walk the earth?\n\nJULES\nYou know, like Caine in \"KUNG FU.\"\nJust walk from town to town, meet\npeople, get in adventures.\n\nVINCENT\nHow long do you intend to walk the\nearth?\n\nJULES\nUntil God puts me where he want me\nto be.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat if he never does?\n\nJULES\nIf it takes forever, I'll wait\nforever.\n\nVINCENT\nSo you decided to be a bum?\n\nJULES\nI'll just be Jules, Vincent \u2013 no\nmore, no less.\n\nVINCENT\nNo Jules, you're gonna be like those\npieces of shit out there who beg for\nchange. They walk around like a bunch\nof fuckin' zombies, they sleep in\ngarbage bins, they eat what I throw\naway, and dogs piss on 'em. They got\na word for 'em, they're called bums.\nAnd without a job, residence, or\nlegal tender, that's what you're\ngonna be \u2013 a fuckin' bum!\n\nJULES\nLook my friend, this is just where\nme and you differ \u2013\n\nVINCENT\n\u2013 what happened was peculiar \u2013 no\ndoubt about it \u2013 but it wasn't water\ninto wine.\n\nJULES\nAll shapes and sizes, Vince.\n\nVINCENT\nStop fuckin' talkin' like that!\n\nJULES\nIf you find my answers frightening,\nVincent, you should cease askin'\nscary questions.\n\nVINCENT\nI gotta take a shit. To be continued.\n\nVincent exits for the restroom.\n\nJules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin\nand Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.\n\nPUMPKIN\nEverybody be cool, this is a robbery!\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nAny of you fuckin' pricks move and\nI'll execute every one of you\nmotherfuckers!  Got that?!\n\nJules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the\ntable, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it\nout, COCKING IT.\n\nPUMPKIN\nCustomers stay seated, waitresses on\nthe floor.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nNow mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,\ndo it or fucking die!\n\nLike lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While\nHoney Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them\nterrified.\n\nPUMPKIN\nYou Mexicans in the kitchen, get out\nhere!  Asta luego!\n\nThree COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.\n\nPUMPKIN\nOn the floor or I'll cook you ass,\ncomprende?\n\nThey comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.\n\nMANAGER\nI'm the manager here, there's no\nproblem, no problem at all \u2013\n\nPumpkin heads his way.\n\nPUMPKIN\nYou're gonna give me a problem?\n\nHe reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the\nManager's neck.\n\nPUMPKIN\nWhat? You said you're gonna give me\na problem?\n\nMANAGER\nNo, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you\nany problem!\n\nPUMPKIN\nI don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks\nlike the hero type to me!\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nDon't take any chances. Execute him!\n\nThe Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his\nhand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.\n\nMANAGER\nPlease don't! I'm not a hero. I'm\njust a coffee shop manager. Take\nanything you want.\n\nPUMPKIN\nTell everyone to cooperate and it'll\nbe all over.\n\nMANAGER\nEverybody just be calm and cooperate\nwith them and this will be all over\nsoon!\n\nPUMPKIN\nWell done, now git your fuckin' ass\non the ground.\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM \u2013 MORNING\n\nVincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,\nreads his \"MODESTY BLAISE\" book.\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP \u2013 MORNING\n\nCash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from\nthe till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter\nwith a trash bag in his hand.\n\nPUMPKIN\nOkay people, I'm going to go 'round\nand collect your wallets. Don't talk,\njust toss 'em in the bag. We clear?\n\nPumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his\n.45 ready to spit under the table.\n\nPumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,\nbriefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more\nrespectful, him manner more on guard.\n\nPUMPKIN\nIn the bag.\n\nJules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,\nPumpkin points to the briefcase.\n\nPUMPKIN\nWhat's in that?\n\nJULES\nMy boss' dirty laundry.\n\nPUMPKIN\nYou boss makes you do his laundry?\n\nJULES\nWhen he wants it clean.\n\nPUMPKIN\nSounds like a shit job.\n\nJULES\nFunny, I've been thinkin' the same\nthing.\n\nPUMPKIN\nOpen it up.\n\nJules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.\n\nJULES\n'Fraid I can't do that.\n\nPumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the\ngun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the\nhammer.\n\nPUMPKIN\nI didn't hear you.\n\nJULES\nYes, you did.\n\nThis exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard\nit, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nWhat's goin' on?\n\nPUMPKIN\nLooks like we got a vigilante in our\nmidst.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nShoot 'em in the face!\n\nJULES\nI don't mean to shatter your ego,\nbut this ain't the first time I've\nhad gun pointed at me.\n\nPUMPKIN\nYou don't open up that case, it's\ngonna be the last.\n\nMANAGER\n(on the ground)\nQuit causing problems, you'll get us\nall killed!

One...\n\nPUMPKIN\n...two... three.\n\nJULES\nYou win.\n\nJules raises his hand off the briefcase.\n\nJULES\nIt's all yours, Ringo.\n\nPUMPKIN\nOpen it.\n\nJules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to\nPumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case.\nPumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across\nthe room, can't see shit.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nWhat is it? What is it?\n\nPUMPKIN\n(softly)\nIs that what I think it is?\n\nJules nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nPUMPKIN\nIt's beautiful.\n\nJules nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nGoddammit, what is it?\n\nJules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering\nthe case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to\npick up the case.\n\nLike a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of\nPumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand\ncomes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45\nhand under Pumpkin's chin.\n\nHoney Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nLet him go! Let him go! I'll blow\nyour fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!\nI'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're\ngonna fuckin' die bad!\n\nJULES\n(to Pumpkin)\nTell that bitch to be cool! Say,\nbitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!\n\nPUMPKIN\nChill out, honey!\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nLet him go!\n\nJULES\n(softly)\nTell her it's gonna be okay.\n\nPUMPKIN\nI'm gonna be okay.\n\nJULES\nPromise her.\n\nPUMPKIN\nI promise.\n\nJULES\nTell her to chill.\n\nPUMPKIN\nJust chill out.\n\nJULES\nWhat's her name?\n\nPUMPKIN\nYolanda.\n\nWhenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only\nat Pumpkin.\n\nJULES\n(to Yolanda)\nSo, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna\ndo anything stupid, are we?\n\nYOLANDA\n(crying)\nDon't you hurt him.\n\nJULES\nNobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're\ngonna be like three Fonzies. And\nwhat' Fonzie like?\n\nNo answer.\n\nJULES\nC'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?\n\nYOLANDA\n(through tears, unsure)\nHe's cool?\n\nJULES\nCorrect-amundo! And that's what we're\ngonna be, we're gonna be cool.\n(to Pumpkin)\nNow Ringo, I'm gonna count to three\nand I want you to let go your gun\nand lay your palms flat on the table.\nBut when you do it, do it cool. Ready?\n\nPumpkin looks at him.\n\nJULES\nOne... two... three.\n\nPumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.\n\nYolanda can't stand it anymore.\n\nYOLANDA\nOkay, now let him go!\n\nJULES\nYolanda, I thought you were gonna be\ncool.  When you yell at me, it makes\nme nervous.  When I get nervous, I\nget scared. And when motherfuckers\nget scared, that's when motherfuckers\nget accidentally shot.\n\nYOLANDA\n(more conversational)\nJust know: you hurt him, you die.\n\nJULES\nThat seems to be the situation. Now\nI don't want that and you don't want\nthat and Ringo here don't want that.\nSo let's see what we can do.\n(to Ringo)\nNow this is the situation. Normally\nboth of your asses would be dead as\nfuckin' fried chicken. But you\nhappened to pull this shit while I'm\nin a transitional period. I don't\nwanna kill ya, I want to help ya.\nBut I'm afraid I can't give you the\ncase. It don't belong to me. Besides,\nI went through too much shit this\nmorning on account of this case to\njust hand it over to your ass.\n\nVINCENT (O.S.)\nWhat the fuck's goin' on here?\n\nYolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.\n\nVincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at\nYolanda.\n\nJULES\nIt's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't\ndo a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's\ncool baby, nothin's changed. We're\nstill just talkin'.\n(to Pumpkin)\nTell her we're still cool.\n\nPUMPKIN\nIt's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still\ncool.\n\nVINCENT\n(gun raised)\nWhat the hell's goin' on, Jules?\n\nJULES\nNothin' I can't handle. I want you\nto just hang back and don't do shit\nunless it's absolutely necessary.\n\nVINCENT\nCheck.\n\nJULES\nYolanda, how we doin, baby?\n\nYOLANDA\nI gotta go pee! I want to go home.\n\nJULES\nJust hang in there, baby, you're\ndoing' great, Ringo's proud of you\nand so am I.  It's almost over.\n(to Pumpkin)\nNow I want you to go in that bag and\nfind my wallet.\n\nPUMPKIN\nWhich one is it?\n\nJULES\nIt's the one that says Bad\nMotherfucker on it.\n\nPumpkin looks in the bag and \u2013 sure enough \u2013 there's a wallet\nwith \"Bad Motherfucker\" embroidered on it.\n\nJULES\nThat's my bad motherfucker. Now open\nit up and take out the cash. How\nmuch is there?\n\nPUMPKIN\nAbout fifteen hundred dollars.\n\nJULES\nPut it in your pocket, it's yours.\nNow with the rest of them wallets\nand the register, that makes this a\npretty successful little score.\n\nVINCENT\nJules, if you give this nimrod fifteen\nhundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on\ngeneral principle.\n\nJULES\nYou ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,\nnow hang back and shut the fuck up.\nBesides, I ain't givin' it to him.\nI'm buyin' somethin' for my money.\nWanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?\n\nPUMPKIN\nWhat?\n\nJULES\nYour life. I'm givin' you that money\nso I don't hafta kill your ass. You\nread the Bible?\n\nPUMPKIN\nNot regularly.\n\nJULES\nThere's a passage I got memorized.\nEzekiel 25:17. \"The path of the\nrighteous man is beset on all sides\nby the inequities of the selfish and\nthe tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is\nhe who, in the name of charity and\ngood will, shepherds the weak through\nthe valley of the darkness. For he\nis truly his brother's keeper and\nthe finder of lost children. And I\nwill strike down upon thee with great\nvengeance and furious anger those\nwho attempt to poison and destroy my\nbrothers. And you will know I am the\nLord when I lay my vengeance upon\nyou.\" I been sayin' that shit for\nyears.  And if you ever heard it, it\nmeant your ass. I never really\nquestioned what it meant. I thought\nit was just a coldblooded thing to\nsay to a motherfucker 'fore you popped\na cap in his ass. But I saw some\nshit this mornin' made me think twice.\nNow I'm thinkin', it could mean you're\nthe evil man. And I'm the righteous\nman.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the\nshepherd protecting my righteous ass\nin the valley of darkness. Or is\ncould by you're the righteous man\nand I'm the shepherd and it's the\nworld that's evil and selfish.  I'd\nlike that. But that shit ain't the\ntruth. The truth is you're the weak.\nAnd I'm the tyranny of evil men. But\nI'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to\nbe a shepherd.\n\nJules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.\n\nPumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to\nYolanda.\n\nShe looks back.\n\nGrabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the\ndoor.\n\nJules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time,\ntakes a sip of coffee.\n\nJULES\n(to himself)\nIt's cold.\n\nHe pushes it aside.\n\nVincent appears next to Jules.\n\nVINCENT\nI think we oughta leave now.\n\nJULES\nThat's probably a good idea.\n\nVincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the\nbriefcase.\n\nThen, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the\nCooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes\n\u2013 wearing UC Santa Cruz and \"I'm with Stupid\" tee-shirts,\nswim trunks, thongs and

ONE\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GRIEF AND OBLIVION\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMademoiselle Albertine has gone!\u201d How much farther does anguish penetrate in psychology than psychology itself! A moment ago, as I lay analysing my feelings, I had supposed that this separation without a final meeting was precisely what I wished, and, as I compared the mediocrity of the pleasures that Albertine afforded me with the richness of the desires which she prevented me from realising, had felt that I was being subtle, had concluded that I did not wish to see her again, that I no longer loved her. But now these words: \u201cMademoiselle Albertine has gone!\u201d had expressed themselves in my heart in the form of an anguish so keen that I would not be able to endure it for any length of time. And so what I had supposed to mean nothing to me was the only thing in my whole life. How ignorant we are of ourselves. The first thing to be done was to make my anguish cease at once. Tender towards myself as my mother had been towards my dying grandmother, I said to myself with that anxiety which we feel to prevent a person whom we love from suffering: \u201cBe patient for just a moment, we shall find something to take the pain away, don\u2019t fret, we are not going to allow you to suffer like this.\u201d It was among ideas of this sort that my instinct of self-preservation sought for the first sedatives to lay upon my open wound: \u201cAll this is not of the slightest importance, for I am going to make her return here at once. I must think first how I am to do it, but in any case she will be here this evening. Therefore, it is useless to worry myself.\u201d \u201cAll this is not of the slightest importance,\u201d I had not been content with giving myself this assurance, I had tried to convey the same impression to Fran\u00e7oise by not allowing her to see what I was suffering, because, even at the moment when I was feeling so keen an anguish, my love did not forget how important it was that it should appear a happy love, a mutual love, especially in the eyes of Fran\u00e7oise, who, as she disliked Albertine, had always doubted her sincerity. Yes, a moment ago, before Fran\u00e7oise came into the room, I had supposed that I was no longer in love with Albertine, I had supposed that I was leaving nothing out of account; a careful analyst, I had supposed that I knew the state of my own heart. But our intelligence, however great it may be, cannot perceive the elements that compose it and remain unsuspected so long as, from the volatile state in which they generally exist, a phenomenon capable of isolating them has not subjected them to the first stages of solidification. I had been mistaken in thinking that I could see clearly into my own heart. But this knowledge which had not been given me by the finest mental perceptions had now been brought to me, hard, glittering, strange, like a crystallised salt, by the abrupt reaction of grief. I was so much in the habit of seeing Albertine in the room, and I saw, all of a sudden, a fresh aspect of Habit. Hitherto I had regarded it chiefly as an annihilating force which suppresses the originality and even our consciousness of our perceptions; now I beheld it as a dread deity, so riveted to ourselves, its meaningless aspect so incrusted in our heart, that if it detaches itself, if it turns away from us, this deity which we can barely distinguish inflicts upon us sufferings more terrible than any other and is then as cruel as death itself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first thing to be done was to read Albertine\u2019s letter, since I was anxious to think of some way of making her return. I felt that this lay in my power, because, as the future is what exists only in our mind, it seems to us to be still alterable by the intervention, in extremis, of our will. But, at the same time, I remembered that I had seen act upon it forces other than my own, against which, however long an interval had been allowed me, I could never have prevailed. Of what use is it that the hour has not yet struck if we can do nothing to influence what is bound to happen. When Albertine was living in the house I had been quite determined to retain the initiative in our parting. And now she had gone. I opened her letter. It ran as follows:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMY DEAR FRIEND\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cForgive me for not having dared to say to you in so many words what I am now writing, but I am such a coward, I have always been so afraid in your presence that I have never been able to force myself to speak. This is what I should have said to you. Our life together has become impossible; you must, for that matter, have seen, when you turned upon me the other evening, that there had been a change in our relations. What we were able to straighten out that night would become irreparable in a few days\u2019 time. It is better for us, therefore, since we have had the good fortune to be reconciled, to part as friends. That is why, my darling, I am sending you this line, and beg you to be so kind as to forgive me if I am causing you a little grief when you think of the immensity of mine. My dear old boy, I do not wish to become your enemy, it will be bad enough to become by degrees, and very soon, a stranger to you; and so, as I have absolutely made up my mind, before sending you this letter by Fran\u00e7oise, I shall have asked her to let me have my boxes. Good-bye: I leave with you the best part of myself\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cALBERTINE.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAll this means nothing,\u201d I told myself, \u201cIt is even better than I thought, for as she doesn\u2019t mean a word of what she says she has obviously written her letter only to give me a severe shock, so that I shall take fright, and not be horrid to her again. I must make some arrangement at once: Albertine must be brought back this evening. It is sad to think that the Bontemps are no better than blackmailers who make use of their niece to extort money from me. But what does that matter? Even if, to bring Albertine back here this evening, I have to give half my fortune to Mme. Bontemps, we shall still have enough left, Albertine and I, to live in comfort.\u201d And, at the same time, I calculated whether I had time to go out that morning and order the yacht and the Rolls-Royce which she coveted, quite forgetting, now that all my hesitation had vanished, that I had decided that it would be unwise to give her them. \u201cEven if Mme. Bontemps\u2019 support is not sufficient, if Albertine refuses to obey her aunt and makes it a condition of her returning to me that she shall enjoy complete independence, well, however much it may distress me, I shall leave her to herself; she shall go out by herself, whenever she chooses. One must be prepared to make sacrifices, however painful they may be, for the thing to which one attaches most importance, which is, in spite of everything that I decided this morning, on the strength of my scrupulous and absurd arguments, that Albertine shall continue to live here.\u201d Can I say for that matter that to leave her free to go where she chose would have been altogether painful to me? I should be lying. Often already I had felt that the anguish of leaving her free to behave improperly out of my sight was perhaps even less than that sort of misery which I used to feel when I guessed that she was bored in my company, under my roof. No doubt at the actual moment of her asking me to let her go somewhere, the act of allowing her to go, with the idea of an organised orgy, would have been an appalling torment. But to say to her: \u201cTake our yacht, or the train, go away for a month, to some place which I have never seen, where I shall know nothing of what you are doing,\u201d\u2014 this had often appealed to me, owing to the thought that, by force of contrast, when she was away from me, she would prefer my society, and would be glad to return. \u201cThis return is certainly what she herself desires; she does not in the least insist upon that freedom upon which, moreover, by offering her every day some fresh pleasure, I should easily succeed in imposing, day by day, a further restriction. No, what Albertine has wanted is that I shall no longer make myself unpleasant to her, and most of all \u2014 like Odette with Swann \u2014 that I shall make up my mind to marry her. Once she is married, her independence will cease to matter; we shall stay here together, in perfect happiness.\u201d No doubt this meant giving up any thought of Venice. But the places for which we have most longed, such as Venice (all the more so, the most agreeable hostesses, such as the Duchesse de Guermantes, amusements such as the theatre), how pale, insignificant, dead they become when we are tied to the heart of another person by a bond so painful that it prevents us from tearing ourselves away. \u201cAlbertine is perfectly right, for that matter, about our marriage. Mamma herself was saying that all these postponements were ridiculous. Marrying her is what I ought to have done long ago, it is what I shall have to do, it is what has made her write her letter without meaning a word of it; it is only to bring about our marriage that she has postponed for a few hours what she must desire as keenly as I desire it: her return to this house. Yes, that is what she meant, that is the purpose of her action,\u201d my compassionate judgment assured me; but I felt that, in telling me this, my judgment was still maintaining the same hypothesis which it had adopted from the start. Whereas I felt that it was the other hypothesis which had invariably proved correct. No doubt this second hypothesis would never have been so bold as to formulate in so many words that Albertine could have had intimate relations with Mile. Vinteuil and her friend. And yet, when I was overwhelmed by the invasion of those terrible tidings, as the train slowed down before stopping at Parville station, it was the second hypothesis that had already been proved correct. This hypothesis had never, in the interval, conceived the idea that Albertine might leave me of her own accord, in this fashion, and without warning me and giving me time to prevent her departure. But all the same if, after the immense leap forwards which life had just made me take, the reality that confronted me was as novel as that which is presented by the discovery of a scientist, the inquiries of an examining magistrate or the researches of a historian into the mystery of a crime or a revolution, this reality while exceeding the meagre previsions of my second hypothesis nevertheless fulfilled them. This second hypothesis was not an intellectual feat, and the panic fear that I had felt on the evening when Albertine had refused to kiss me, the night when I had heard the sound of her window being opened, that fear was not based upon reason. But \u2014 and the sequel will shew this more clearly, as several episodes must have indicated it already \u2014 the fact that our intellect is not the most subtle, the most powerful, the most appropriate instrument for grasping the truth, is only a reason the more for beginning with the intellect, and not with a subconscious intuition, a ready-made faith in presentiments. It is life that, little by little, case by case, enables us to observe that what is most important to our heart, or to our mind, is learned not by reasoning but by other powers. And then it is the intellect itself which, taking note of their superiority, abdicates its sway to them upon reasoned grounds and consents to become their collaborator and their servant. It is faith confirmed by experiment. The unforeseen calamity with which I found myself engaged, it seemed to me that I had already known it also (as I had known of Albertine\u2019s friendship with a pair of Lesbians), from having read it in so many signs in which (notwithstanding the contrary affirmations of my reason, based upon Albertine\u2019s own statements) I had discerned the weariness, the horror that she felt at having to live in that state of slavery, signs traced as though in invisible ink behind her sad, submissive eyes, upon her cheeks suddenly inflamed with an unaccountable blush, in the sound of the window that had suddenly been flung open. No doubt I had not ventured to interpret them in their full significance or to form a definite idea of her immediate departure. I had thought, with a mind kept in equilibrium by Albertine\u2019s presence, only of a departure arranged by myself at an undetermined date, that is to say a date situated in a non-existent time; consequently I had had merely the illusion of thinking of a departure, just as people imagine that they are not afraid of death when they think of it while they are in good health and actually do no more than introduce a purely negative idea into a healthy state which the approach of death would automatically destroy. Besides, the idea of Albertine\u2019s departure on her own initiative might have occurred to my mind a thousand times over, in the clearest, the most sharply defined form, and I should no more have suspected what, in relation to myself, that is to say in reality, that departure would be, what an unprecedented, appalling, unknown thing, how entirely novel a calamity. Of her departure, had I foreseen it, I might have gone on thinking incessantly for years on end, and yet all my thoughts of it, placed end to end, would not have been comparable for an instant, not merely in intensity but in kind, with the unimaginable hell the curtain of which Fran\u00e7oise had raised for me when she said: \u201cMademoiselle Albertine has gone.\u201d In order to form an idea of an unknown situation our imagination borrows elements that are already familiar and for that reason does not form any idea of it. But our sensibility, even in its most physical form, receives, as it were the brand of the lightning, the original and for long indelible imprint of the novel event. And I scarcely ventured to say to myself that, if I had foreseen this departure, I would perhaps have been incapable of picturing it to myself in all its horror, or indeed, with Albertine informing me of it, and myself threatening, imploring her, of preventing it! How far was any longing for Venice removed from me now! As far as, in the old days at Combray, was the longing to know Mme. de Guermantes when the time came at which I longed for one thing only, to have Mamma in my room. And it was indeed all these anxieties that I had felt ever since my childhood, which, at the bidding of this new anguish, had come hastening to reinforce it, to amalgamate themselves with it in a homogeneous mass that was stifling me. To be sure, the physical blow which such a parting strikes at the heart, and which, because of that terrible capacity for registering things with which the body is endowed, makes our suffering somehow contemporaneous with all the epochs in our life in which we have suffered; to be sure, this blow at the heart upon which the woman speculates a little perhaps \u2014 so little compunction do we shew for the sufferings of other people \u2014 who is anxious to give the maximum intensity to regret, whether it be that, merely hinting at an imaginary departure, she is seeking only to demand better terms, or that, leaving us for ever \u2014 for ever! \u2014 she desires to wound us, or, in order to avenge herself, or to continue to be loved, or to enhance the memory that she will leave behind her, to rend asunder the net of weariness, of indifference which she has felt being woven about her \u2014 to be sure, this blow at our heart, we had vowed that we would avoid it, had assured ourselves that we would make a good finish. But it is rarely indeed that we do finish well, for, if all was well, we would never finish! And besides, the woman to whom we shew the utmost indifference feels nevertheless in an obscure fashion that while we have been growing tired of her, by virtue of an identical force of habit, we have grown more and more attached to her, and she reflects that one of the essential elements in a good finish is to warn the other person before one goes. But she is afraid, if she warns us, of preventing her own departure. Every woman feels that, if her power over a man is great, the only way to leave him is sudden flight. A fugitive because a queen, precisely. To be sure, there is an unspeakable interval between the boredom which she inspired a moment ago and, because she has gone, this furious desire to have her back again. But for this, apart from those which have been furnished in the course of this work and others which will be furnished later on, there are reasons. For one thing, her departure occurs as often as not at the moment when our indifference \u2014 real or imagined \u2014 is greatest, at the extreme point of the oscillation of the pendulum. The woman says to herself: \u201cNo, this sort of thing cannot go on any longer,\u201d simply because the man speaks of nothing but leaving her, or thinks of nothing else; and it is she who leaves him. Then, the pendulum swinging back to its other extreme, the interval is all the greater. In an instant it returns to this point; once more, apart from all the reasons that have been given, it is so natural. Our heart still beats; and besides, the woman who has gone is no longer the same as the woman who was with us. Her life under our roof, all too well known, is suddenly enlarged by the addition of the lives with which she is inevitably to be associated, and it is perhaps to associate herself with them that she has left us. So that this novel richness of the life of the woman who has gone reacts upon the woman who was with us and was perhaps planning her departure. To the series of psychological facts which we are able to deduce and which form part of her life with us, our too evident boredom in her company, our jealousy also (the effect of which is that the men who have been left by a number of women have been left almost always in the same manner because of their character and of certain always identical reactions which can be calculated: each man has his own way of being betrayed, as he has his own way of catching cold), to this series not too mysterious for us, there corresponds doubtless a series of facts of which we were unaware. She must for some tune past have been keeping up relations, written, or verbal or through messengers, with some man, or some woman, have been awaiting some signal which we may perhaps have given her ourselves, unconsciously, when we said: \u201cX. called yesterday to see me,\u201d if she had arranged with X. that on the eve of the day when she was to join him he was to call upon me. How many possible hypotheses! Possible only. I constructed the truth so well, but in the realm of possibility only, that, having one day opened, and then by mistake, a letter addressed to my mistress, from this letter which was written in a code, and said: \u201cGo on waiting for a signal to go to the Marquis de Saint-Loup; let me know to-morrow by telephone,\u201d I reconstructed a sort of projected flight; the name of the Marquis de Saint-Loup was there only as a substitute for some other name, for my mistress did not know Saint-Loup well enough, but had heard me speak of him, and moreover the signature was some sort of nickname, without any intelligible form. As it happened, the letter was addressed not to my mistress but to another person in the building who bore a different name which had been misread. The letter was written not in code, but in bad French, because it was written by an American woman, who was indeed a friend of Saint-Loup as he himself told me. And the odd way in which this American woman wrote certain letters had given the appearance of a nickname to a name which was quite genuine, only foreign. And so I had on that occasion been entirely at fault in my suspicions. But the intellectual structure which had in my mind combined these facts, all of them false, was itself so accurate, so inflexible form of the truth that when three months later my mistress, who had at that time been meaning to spend the rest of her life with me, left me, it was in a fashion absolutely identical with that which I had imagined on the former occasion. A letter arrived, containing the same peculiarities which I had wrongly attributed to the former letter, but this time it was indeed meant as a signal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This calamity was the greatest that I had experienced in my life. And, when all was said, the suffering that it caused me was perhaps even exceeded by my curiosity to learn the causes of this calamity which Albertine had deliberately brought about. But the sources of great events are like those of rivers, in vain do we explore the earth\u2019s surface, we can never find them. So Albertine had for a long time past been planning lier flight; I have said (and at the time it had seemed to me simply a sign of affectation and ill humour, what Fran\u00e7oise called \u2018lifting her head\u2019) that, from the day upon which she had ceased to kiss me, she had gone about as though tormented by a devil, stiffly erect, unbending, saying the simplest things in a sorrowful tone, slow in her movements, never once smiling. I cannot say that there was any concrete proof of conspiracy with the outer world. Fran\u00e7oise told me long afterwards that, having gone into Albertine\u2019s room two days before her departure, she had found it empty, the curtains drawn, but had detected from the atmosphere of the room and the sounds that came in that the window was open. And indeed she had found Albertine on the balcony. But it is hard to say with whom she could have been communicating from there, and moreover the drawn curtains screening the open window could doubtless be explained by her knowing that I was afraid of draughts, and by the fact that, even if the curtains afforded me little protection, they would prevent Fran\u00e7oise from seeing from the passage that the shutters had been opened so early. No, I can see nothing save one trifling incident which proves merely that on the day before her departure she knew that she was going. For during the day she took from my room without my noticing it a large quantity of wrapping paper and cloth which I kept there, and in which she spent the whole night packing her innumerable wrappers and dressing-gowns so that she might leave the house in the morning; this was the only incident, it was more than enough. I cannot attach any importance to her having almost forced upon me that evening a thousand francs which she owed me, there is nothing peculiar in that, for she was extremely scrupulous about money. Yes, she took the wrapping paper overnight, but it was not only then that she knew that she was going to leave me! For it was not resentment that made her leave me, but her determination, already formed, to leave me, to abandon the life of which she had dreamed, that gave her that air of resentment. A resentful air, almost solemnly cold toward myself, except on the last evening when, after staying in my room longer than she had intended, she said \u2014 a remark which surprised me, coming from her who had always sought to postpone the moment of parting \u2014 she said to me from the door: \u201cGood-bye, my dear; good-bye, my dear.\u201d But I did not take any notice of this, at the moment. Fran\u00e7oise told me that next morning when Albertine informed her that she was going (but this, for that matter, may be explained also by exhaustion for she had spent the whole night in packing all her clothes, except the things for which she had to ask Fran\u00e7oise as they were not in her bedroom or her dressing-room), she was still so sad, so much more erect, so much stiffer than during the previous days that Fran\u00e7oise, when Albertine said to her: \u201cGood-bye, Fran\u00e7oise,\u201d almost expected to see her fall to the ground. When we are told anything like this, we realise that the woman who appealed to us so much less than any of the women whom we meet so easily in the course of the briefest outing, the woman who makes us resent our having to sacrifice them to herself, is on the contrary she whom now we would a thousand times rather possess. For the choice lies no longer between a certain pleasure \u2014 which has become by force of habit, and perhaps by the insignificance of its object, almost nothing \u2014 and other pleasures, which tempt and thrill us, but between these latter pleasures and something that is far stronger than they, compassion for suffering\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I vowed to myself that Albertine would be back in the house before night, I had proceeded in hot haste to cover with a fresh belief the open wound from which I had torn the belief that had been my mainstay until then. But however rapidly my instinct of self-preservation might have acted, I had, when Fran\u00e7oise spoke to me, been left for an instant without relief, and it was useless my knowing now that Albertine would return that same evening, the pain that I had felt in the instant in which I had not yet assured myself of her return (the instant that had followed the words: \u201cMademoiselle Albertine has asked for her boxes, Mademoiselle Albertine has gone\u201d), this revived in me of its own accord as keen as it had been before, that is to say as if I had still been unaware of Albertine\u2019s immediate return. However, it was essential that she should return, but of her own accord. Upon every hypothesis, to appear to be taking the first step, to be begging her to return would be to defeat my own object. To be sure, I had not the strength to give her up as I had given up Gilberte. Even more than to see Albertine again, what I wished was to put an end to the physical anguish which my heart, less stout than of old, could endure no longer. Then, by dint of accustoming myself to not wishing anything, whether it was a question of work or of anything else, I had become more cowardly. But above all, this anguish was incomparably keener for several reasons, the most important of which was perhaps not that I had never tasted any sensual pleasure with Mme. de Guermantes or with Gilberte, but that, not seeing them every day, and at every hour of the day, having no opportunity and consequently no need to see them, there had been less prominent, in my love for them, the immense force of Habit. Perhaps, now that my heart, incapable of wishing and of enduring of its own free will what I was suffering, found only one possible solution, that Albertine should return at all costs, perhaps the opposite solution (a deliberate renunciation, gradual resignation) would have seemed to me a novelist\u2019s solution, improbable in real life, had I not myself decided upon it in the past when Gilberte was concerned. I knew therefore that this other solution might be accepted also and by the same man, for I had remained more or less the same. Only time had played its part, time which had made me older, time which moreover had kept Albertine perpetually in my company while we were living together. But I must add that, without my giving up the idea of that life, there survived in me of all that I had felt about Gilberte the pride which made me refuse to be to Albertine a repellent plaything by insisting upon her return; I wished her to come back without my appearing to attach any importance to her return. I got out of bed, so as to lose no more time, but was arrested by my anguish; this was the first time that I had got out of bed since Albertine had left me. Yet I must dress myself at once in order to go and make inquiries of her porter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Suffering, the prolongation of a spiritual shock that has come from without, keeps on endeavouring to change its form; we hope to be able to dispel it by making plans, by seeking information; we wish it to pass through its countless metamorphoses, this requires less courage than retaining our suffering intact; the bed appears so narrow, hard and cold on which we lie down with our grief. I put my feet to the ground; I stepped across the room with endless precautions, took up a position from which I could not see Albertine\u2019s chair, the pianola upon the pedals of which she used to press her golden slippers, nor a single one of the things which she had used and all of which, in the secret language that my memory had imparted to them, seemed to be seeking to give me a fresh translation, a different version, to announce to me for the second time the news of her departure. But even without looking at them I could see them, my strength left me, I sank down upon one of those blue satin armchairs, the glossy surface of which an hour earlier, in the dimness of my bedroom anaesthetised by a ray of morning light, had made me dream dreams which then I had passionately caressed, which were so far from me now. Alas, I had never sat down upon any of them until this minute save when Albertine was still with me. And so I could not remain sitting there, I rose; and thus, at every moment there was one more of those innumerable and humble \u2018selves\u2019 that compose our personality which was still unaware of Albertine\u2019s departure and must be informed of it; I was obliged \u2014 and this was more cruel than if they had been strangers and had not borrowed my sensibility to pain \u2014 to describe to all these \u2018selves\u2019 who did not yet know of it, the calamity that had just occurred, it was necessary that each of them in turn should hear for the first time the words: \u201cAlbertine has asked for her boxes\u201d\u2014 those coffin-shaped boxes which I had seen put on the train at Balbec with my mother\u2019s \u2014\u201cAlbertine has gone.\u201d To each of them I had to relate my grief, the grief which is in no way a pessimistic conclusion freely drawn from a number of lamentable circumstances, but is the intermittent and involuntary revival of a specific impression, come to us from without and not chosen by us. There were some of these \u2018selves\u2019 which I had not encountered for a long time past. For instance (I had not remembered that it was the day on which the barber called) the \u2018self that I was when I was having my hair cut. I had forgotten this \u2018self,\u2019 the barber\u2019s arrival made me burst into tears, as, at a funeral, does the appearance of an old pensioned servant who has not forgotten the deceased. Then all of a sudden I recalled that, during the last week, I had from time to time been seized by panic fears which I had not confessed to myself. At such moments, however, I had debated the question, saying to myself: \u201cUseless, of course, to consider the hypothesis of her suddenly leaving me. It is absurd. If I were to confess it to a sober, intelligent man\u201d (and I should have done so to secure peace of mind, had not jealousy prevented me from making confidences) \u201che would be sure to say to me: \u2018Why, you are mad. It is impossible.\u2019 And, as a matter of fact, during these jjast days we have not quarrelled once. People separate for a reason. They tell you their reason. They give you a chance to reply. They do not run away like that. No, it is perfectly childish. It is the only hypothesis that is absurd.\u201d And yet, every day, when I found that she was still there in the morning when I fang my bell, I had heaved a vast sigh of relief. And when Fran\u00e7oise handed me Albertine\u2019s letter, I had at once been certain that it referred to the one thing that could not happen, to this departure which I had in a sense perceived many days in advance, in spite of the logical reasons for my feeling reassured. I had said this to myself almost with satisfaction at my own perspicacity in my despair, like a murderer who knows that his guilt cannot be detected, but is nevertheless afraid and all of a sudden sees his victim\u2019s name written at the head of a document on the table of the police official who has sent for him. My only hope was that Albertine had gone to Touraine, to her aunt\u2019s house where, after all, she would be fairly well guarded and could not do anything very serious in the interval before I brought her back. My worst fear was that she might be remaining in Paris, or have gone to Amsterdam or to Montjouvain, in other words that she had escaped in order to involve herself in some intrigue the preliminaries of which I had failed to observe. But in reality when I said to myself Paris, Amsterdam, Montjouvain, that is to say various names of places, I was thinking of places which were merely potential. And so, when Albertine\u2019s hall porter informed me that she had gone to Touraine, this place of residence which I supposed myself to desire seemed to me the most terrible of them all, because it was real, and because, tormented for the first time by the certainty of the present and the uncertainty of the future, I pictured to myself Albertine starting upon a life which she had deliberately chosen to lead apart from myself, perhaps for a long time, perhaps for ever, and in which she would realise that unknown element which in the past had so often distressed me when, nevertheless, I had enjoyed the happiness of possessing, of caressing what was its outer shell, that charming face impenetrable and captive. It was this unknown element that formed the core of my love. Outside the door of Albertine\u2019s house I found a poor little girl who gazed at me open-eyed and looked so honest that I asked her whether she would care to come home with me, as I might have taken home a dog with faithful eyes. She seemed pleased by my suggestion. When I got home, I held her for some time on my knee, but very soon her presence, by making me feel too keenly Albertine\u2019s absence, became intolerable. And I asked her to go away, giving her first a five-hundred franc note. And yet, a moment later, the thought of having some other little girl in the house with me, of never being alone, without the comfort of an innocent presence, was the only thing that enabled me to endure the idea that Albertine might perhaps remain away for some time before returning. As for Albertine herself, she barely existed in me save under the form of her name, which, but for certain rare moments of respite when I awoke, came and engraved itself upon my brain and continued incessantly to do so. If I had thought aloud, I should have kept on repeating it, and my speech would have been as monotonous, as limited as if I had been transformed into a bird, a bird like that in the fable whose song repeated incessantly the name of her whom, when a man, it had loved. We say the name to ourselves, and as we remain silent it seems as though we inscribed it on ourselves, as though it left its trace on our brain which must end by being, like a wall upon which somebody has amused himself by scribbling, entirely covered with the name, written a thousand times over, of her whom we love. We repeat it all the time in our mind, even when we are happy, all the more when we are unhappy. And to repeat this name, which gives us nothing in addition to what we already know, we feel an incessantly renewed desire, but, in the course of time, it wearies us. To carnal pleasure I did not even give a thought at this moment; I did not even see, with my mind\u2019s eye, the image of that Albertine, albeit she had been the cause of such an upheaval of my existence, I did not perceive her body and if I had wished to isolate the idea that was bound up \u2014 for there is always some idea bound up \u2014 with my suffering, it would have been alternately, on the one hand my doubt as to the intention with which she had left me, with or without any thought of returning, and on the other hand the means of bringing her back. Perhaps there is something symbolical and true in the minute place occupied in our anxiety by the person who is its cause. The fact is that the person counts for little or nothing; what is almost everything is the series of emotions, of agonies which similar mishaps have made us feel in the past in connexion with her and which habit has attached to her. What proves this clearly is, even more than the boredom which we feel in moments of happiness, that the fact of seeing or not seeing the person in question, of being or not being admired by her, of having or not having her at our disposal will seem to us utterly trivial when we shall no longer have to set ourselves the problem (so superfluous that we shall no longer take the trouble to consider it) save in relation to the person herself \u2014 the series of emotions and agonies being forgotten, at least in so far as she is concerned, for it may have developed afresh but in connexion with another person. Before this, when it was still attached to her, we supposed that our happiness was dependent upon her presence; it depended merely upon the cessation of our anxiety. Our subconscious was therefore more clairvoyant than ourselves at that moment, when it made the form of the beloved woman so minute, a form which we had indeed perhaps forgotten, which we might have failed to remember clearly and thought unattractive, in the terrible drama in which finding her again in order to cease from expecting her becomes an absolutely vital matter. Minute proportions of the woman\u2019s form, a logical and necessary effect of the fashion in which love develops, a clear allegory of the subjective nature of that love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The spirit in which Albertine had left me was similar no doubt to that of the nations who pave the way by a demonstration of their armed force for the exercise of their diplomacy. She could not have left me save in the hope of obtaining from me better terms, greater freedom, more comfort. In that case the one of us who would have conquered would have been myself, had I had the strength to await the moment when, seeing that she could gam nothing, she would return of her own accord. But if at cards, or in war, where victory alone matters, we can hold out against bluff, the conditions are not the same that are created by love and jealousy, not to mention suffering. If, in order to wait, to \u2018hold out,\u2019 I allowed Albertine to remain away from me for several days, for several weeks perhaps, I was ruining what had been my sole purpose for more than a year, never to leave her by herself for a single hour. All my precautions were rendered fruitless, if I allowed her the time, the opportunity to betray me as often as she might choose, and if in the end she did return to me, I should never again be able to forget the time when she had been alone, and even if I won in the end, nevertheless in the past, that is to say irreparably, I should be the vanquished party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for the means of bringing Albertine back, they had all the more chance of success the more plausible the hypothesis appeared that she had left me only in the hope of being summoned back upon more favourable terms. And no doubt to the people who did not believe in Albertine\u2019s sincerity, certainly to Fran\u00e7oise for instance, this was the more plausible hypothesis. But my reason, to which the only explanation of certain bouts of ill humour, of certain attitudes had appeared, before I knew anything, to be that she had planned a final departure, found it difficult to believe that, now that her departure had occurred, it was a mere feint. I say my reason, not myself. The hypothesis of a feint became all the more necessary to me the more improbable it was, and gained in strength what it lost in probability. When we find ourselves on the brink of the abyss, and it seems as though God has forsaken us, we no longer hesitate to expect a miracle of Him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I realise that in all this I was the most apathetic, albeit the most anxious of detectives. But Albertine\u2019s flight had not restored to myself the faculties of which the habit of having her watched by other people had deprived me. I could think of one thing only: how to employ some one else upon the search for her. This other person was Saint-Loup, who agreed. The transference of the anxiety of so many days to another person filled me with joy and I quivered with the certainty of success, my hands becoming suddenly dry again as in the past, and no longer moist with that sweat in which Fran\u00e7oise had bathed me when she said: \u201cMademoiselle Albertine has gone.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reader may remember that when I decided to live with Albertine, and even to marry her, it was in order to guard her, to know what she was doing, to prevent her from returning to her old habits with Mlle. Vinteuil. It had been in the appalling anguish caused by her revelation at Balbec when she had told me, as a thing that was quite natural, and I succeeded, albeit it was the greatest grief that I had ever yet felt in my life, in seeming to find quite natural the thing which in my worst suppositions I had never had the audacity to imagine. (It is astonishing what a want of imagination jealousy, which spends its time in weaving little suppositions of what is untrue, shews when it is a question of discovering the truth.) Now this love, born first and foremost of a need to prevent Albertine from doing wrong, this love had preserved in the sequel the marks of its origin. Being with her mattered little to me so long as I could prevent her from \u201cbeing on the run,\u201d from going to this place or to that. In order to prevent her, I had had recourse to the vigilance, to the company of the people who went about with her, and they had only to give me at the end of the day a report that was fairly reassuring for my anxieties to vanish in good humour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having given myself the assurance that, whatever steps I might have to take, Albertine would be back in the house that same evening, I had granted a respite to the grief which Fran\u00e7oise had caused me when she told me that Albertine had gone (because at that moment my mind taken by surprise had believed for an instant that her departure was final). But after an interruption, when with an impulse of its own independent life the initial suffering revived spontaneously in me, it was just as keen as before, because it was anterior to the consoling promise that I had given myself to bring Albertine back that evening. This utterance, which would have calmed it, my suffering had not heard. To set in motion the means of bringing about her return, once again, not that such an attitude on my part would ever have proved very successful, but because I had always adopted it since I had been in love with Albertine, I was condemned to behave as though I did not love her, was not pained by her departure, I was condemned to continue to lie to her. I might be all the more energetic in my efforts to bring her back in that personally I should appear to have given her up for good. I decided to write Albertine a farewell letter in which I would regard her departure as final, while I would send Saint-Loup down to put upon Mme. Bontemps, as though without my knowledge, the most brutal pressure to make Albertine return as soon as possible. No doubt I had had experience with Gilberte of the danger of letters expressing an indifference which, feigned at first, ends by becoming genuine. And this experience ought to have restrained me from writing to Albertine letters of the same sort as those that I had written to Gilberte. But what we call experience is merely the revelation to our own eyes of a trait in our character which naturally reappears, and reappears all the more markedly because we have already brought it into prominence once of our own accord, so that the spontaneous impulse which guided us on the first occasion finds itself reinforced by all the suggestions of memory. The human plagiarism which it is most difficult to avoid, for individuals (and even for nations which persevere in their faults and continue to aggravate them) is the plagiarism of ourselves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Knowing that Saint-Loup was in Paris I had sent for him immediately; he came in haste to my rescue, swift and efficient as he had been long ago at Donci\u00e8res, and agreed to set off at once for Touraine. I suggested to him the following arrangement. He was to take the train to Chatellerault, find out where Mme. Bontemps lived, and wait until Albertine should have left the house, since there was a risk of her recognising him. \u201cBut does the girl you are speaking of know me, then?\u201d he asked. I told him that I did not think so. This plan of action filled me with indescribable joy. It was nevertheless diametrically opposed to my original intention: to arrange things so that I should not appear to be seeking Albertine\u2019s return; whereas by so acting I must inevitably appear to be seeking it, but this plan had inestimable advantage over \u2018the proper thing to do\u2019 that it enabled me to say to myself that some one sent by me was going to see Albertine, and would doubtless bring her back with him. And if I had been able to read my own heart clearly at the start, I might have foreseen that it was this solution, hidden in the darkness, which I felt to be deplorable, that would ultimately prevail over the alternative course of patience which I had decided to choose, from want of will-power. As Saint-Loup already appeared slightly surprised to learn that a girl had been living with me through the whole winter without my having said a word to him about her, as moreover he had often spoken to me of the girl who had been at Balbec and I had never said in reply: \u201cBut she is living here,\u201d he might be annoyed by my want of confidence. There was always the risk of Mme. Bontemps\u2019s mentioning Balbec to him. But I was too impatient for his departure, for his arrival at the other end, to wish, to be able to think of the possible consequences of his journey. As for the risk of his recognising Albertine (at whom he had resolutely refrained from looking when he had met her at Donci\u00e8res), she had, as everyone admitted, so altered and had grown so much stouter that it was hardly likely. He asked me whether I had not a picture of Albertine. I replied at first that I had not, so that he might not have a chance, from her photograph, taken about the time of our stay at Balbec, of recognising Albertine, though he had had no more than a glimpse of her in the railway carriage. But then I remembered that in the photograph she would be already as different from the Albertine of Balbec as the living Albertine now was, and that he would recognise her no better from her photograph than in the flesh. While I was looking for it, he laid his hand gently upon my brow, by way of consoling me. I was touched by the distress which the grief that he guessed me to be feeling was causing him. For one thing, however final his rupture with Rachel, what he had felt at that time was not yet so remote that he had not a special sympathy, a special pity for this sort of suffering, as we feel ourselves more closely akin to a person who is afflicted with the same malady as ourselves. Besides, he had so strong an affection for myself that the thought of my suffering was intolerable to him. And so he conceived, towards her who was the cause of my suffering, a rancour mingled with admiration. He regarded me as so superior a being that he supposed that if I were to subject myself to another person she must be indeed extraordinary. I quite expected that he would think Albertine, in her photograph, pretty, but as at the same time I did not imagine that it would produce upon him the impression that Helen made upon the Trojan elders, as I continued to look for it, I said modestly: \u201cOh! you know, you mustn\u2019t imagine things, for one thing it is a bad photograph, and besides there\u2019s nothing startling about her, she is not a beauty, she is merely very nice.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, she must be wonderful,\u201d he said with a simple, sincere enthusiasm as he sought to form a mental picture of the person who was capable of plunging me in such despair and agitation. \u201cI am angry with her because she has hurt you, but at the same time one can\u2019t help seeing that a man who is an artist to his fingertips like you, that you, who love beauty in everything and with so passionate a love, were predestined to suffer more than the ordinary person when you found it in a woman.\u201d At last I managed to find her photograph. \u201cShe is bound to be wonderful,\u201d still came from Robert, who had not seen that I was holding out the protograph to him. All at once he caught sight of it, he held it for a moment between his hands. His face expressed a stupefaction which amounted to stupidity. \u201cIs this the girl you are in love with?\u201d he said at length in a tone from which astonishment was banished by his fear of making me angry. He made no remark upon it, he had assumed the reasonable, prudent, inevitably somewhat disdainful air which we assume before a sick person \u2014 even if he has been in the past a man of outstanding gifts, and our friend \u2014 who is now nothing of the sort, for, raving mad, he speaks to us of a celestial being who has appeared to him, and continues to behold this being where we, the sane man, can see nothing but a quilt on the bed. I at once understood Robert\u2019s astonishment and that it was the same in which the sight of his mistress had plunged me, with this difference only that I had recognised in her a woman whom I already knew, whereas he supposed that he had never seen Albertine. But no doubt the difference between our respective impressions of the same person was equally great. The time was past when I had timidly begun at Balbec by adding to my visual sensations when I gazed at Albertine sensations of taste, of smell, of touch. Since then, other more profound, more pleasant, more indefinable sensations had been added to them, and afterwards painful sensations. In short, Albertine was merely, like a stone round which snow has gathered, the generating centre of an immense structure which rose above the plane of my heart. Robert, to whom all this stratification of sensations was invisible, grasped only a residue of it which it prevented me, on the contrary, from perceiving. What had disconcerted Robert when his eyes fell upon Albertine\u2019s photograph was not the consternation of the Trojan elders when they saw Helen go by and said: \u201cAll our misfortunes are not worth a single glance from her eyes,\u201d but the exactly opposite impression which may be expressed by: \u201cWhat, it is for this that he has worked himself into such a state, has grieved himself so, has done so many idiotic things!\u201d It must indeed be admitted that this sort of reaction at the sight of the person who has caused the suffering, upset the life, sometimes brought about the death of some one whom we love, is infinitely more frequent than that felt by the Trojan elders, and is in short habitual. This is not merely because love is individual, nor because, when we do not feel it, finding it avoidable and philosophising upon the folly of other people come naturally to us. No, it is because, when it has reached the stage at which it causes such misery, the structure composed of the sensations interposed between the face of the woman and the eyes of her lover \u2014 the huge egg of pain which encases it and conceals it as a mantle of snow conceals a fountain \u2014 is already raised so high that the point at which the lover\u2019s gaze comes to rest, the point at which he finds his pleasure and his sufferings, is as far from the point which other people see as is the real sun from the place in which its condensed light enables us to see it in the sky. And what is more, during this time, beneath the chrysalis of griefs and affections which render invisible to the lover the worst metamorphoses of the beloved object, her face has had time to grow old and to change. With the result that if the face which the lover saw on the first occasion is very far removed from that which he has seen since he has been in love and has been made to suffer, it is, in the opposite direction, equally far from the face which may now be seen by the indifferent onlooker. (What would have happened if, instead of the photograph of one who was still a girl, Robert had seen the photograph of an elderly mistress?) And indeed we have no need to see for the first time the woman who has caused such an upheaval, in order to feel this astonishment. Often we know her already, as my great-uncle knew Odette. Then the optical difference extends not merely to the bodily aspect, but to the character, to the individual importance. It is more likely than not that the woman who is causing the man who is in love with her to suffer has already behaved perfectly towards some one who was not interested in her, just as Odette who was so cruel to Swann had been the sedulous \u2018lady in pink\u2019 to my great-uncle, or indeed that the person whose every decision is calculated in advance with as much dread as that of a deity by the man who is in love with her, appears as a person of no importance, only too glad to do anything that he may require of her, in the eyes of the man who is not in love with her, as Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress appeared to me who saw in her nothing more than that \u2018Rachel, when from the Lord\u2019 who had so repeatedly been offered me. I recalled my own stupefaction, that first time that I met her with Saint-Loup, at the thought that anybody could be tormented by not knowing what such a woman had been doing, by the itch to know what she might have said in a whisper to some other man, why she had desired a rupture. And I felt that all this past existence \u2014 but, in this case, Albertine\u2019s \u2014 toward which every fibre of my heart, of my life was directed with a throbbing, clumsy pain, must appear just as insignificant to Saint-Loup as it would one day, perhaps, appear to myself. I felt that I would pass perhaps gradually, so far as the insignificance or gravity of Albertine\u2019s past was concerned, from the state of mind in which I was at the moment to that of Saint-Loup, for I was under no illusion as to what Saint-Loup might be thinking, as to what anyone else than the lover himself might think. And I was not unduly distressed. Let us leave pretty women to men devoid of imagination. I recalled that tragic explanation of so many of us which is furnished by an inspired but not lifelike portrait, such as Elstir\u2019s portrait of Odette, which is a portrait not so much of a mistress as of our degrading love for her. There was lacking only what we find in so many portraits \u2014 that the painter should have been at once a great artist and a lover (and even then it was said that Elstir had been in love with Odette). This disparity, the whole life of a lover \u2014 of a lover whose acts of folly nobody understands \u2014 the whole life of a Swann goes to prove. But let the lover be embodied in a painter like Elstir and then we have the clue to the enigma, we have at length before our eyes those lips which the common herd have never perceived, that nose which nobody has ever seen, that unsuspected carriage. The portrait says: \u201cWhat I have loved, what has made me suffer, what I have never ceased to behold is this.\u201d By an inverse gymnastic, I who had made a mental effort to add to Rachel all that Saint-Loup had added to her of himself, I attempted to subtract the support of my heart and mind from the composition of Albertine and to picture her to myself as she must appear to Saint-Loup, as Rachel had appeared to me. Those differences, even though we were to observe them ourselves, what importance would we attach to them? When, in the summer at Balbec, Albertine used to wait for me beneath the arcades of Incarville and spring into my carriage, not only had she not yet put on weight, she had, as a result of too much exercise, begun to waste; thin, made plainer by an ugly hat which left visible only the tip of an ugly nose, and a side-view, pale cheeks like white slugs, I recognised very little of her, enough however to know, when she sprang into the carriage, that it was she, that she had been punctual in keeping our appointment and had not gone somewhere else; and this was enough; what we love is too much in the past, consists too much in the time that we have spent together for us to require the whole woman; we wish only to be sure that it is she, not to be mistaken as to her identity, a thing far more important than beauty to those who are in love; her cheeks may grow hollow, her body thin, even to those who were originally most proud, in the eyes of the world, of their domination over beauty, that little tip of a nose, that sign in which is summed up the permanent personality of a woman, that algebraical formula, that constant, is sufficient to prevent a man who is courted in the highest society and is in love with her from being free upon a single evening because he is spending his evenings in brushing and entangling, until it is time to go to bed, the hair of the woman whom he loves, or simply in staying by her side, so that he may be with her or she with him, or merely that she may not be with other people\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are sure,\u201d Robert asked me, \u201cthat I can begin straight away by offering this woman thirty thousand francs for her husband\u2019s constituency? She is as dishonest as all that? You\u2019re sure you aren\u2019t exaggerating and that three thousand francs wouldn\u2019t be enough?\u201d \u201cNo, I beg of you, don\u2019t try to be economical about a thing that matters so much to me. This is what you are to say to her (and it is to some extent true): \u2018My friend borrowed these thirty thousand francs from a relative for the election expenses of the uncle of the girl he was engaged to marry. It was because of this engagement that the money was given him. And he asked me to bring it to you so that Albertine should know nothing about it. And now Albertine goes and leaves him. He doesn\u2019t know what to do. He is obliged to pay back the thirty thousand francs if he does not marry Albertine. And if he is going to marry her, then if only to keep up appearances she ought to return immediately, because it will look so bad if she stays away for long.\u2019 You think I\u2019ve made all this up?\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d Saint-Loup assured me out of consideration for myself, out of discretion, and also because he knew that truth is often stranger than fiction. After all, it was by no means impossible that in this tale of the thirty thousand francs there might be, as I had told him, a large element of truth. It was possible, but it was not true and this element of truth was in fact a lie. But we lied to each other, Robert and I, as in every conversation when one friend is genuinely anxious to help another who is desperately in love. The friend who is being counsellor, prop, comforter, may pity the other\u2019s distress but cannot share it, and the kinder he is to him the more he has to lie. And the other confesses to him as much as is necessary in order to secure his help, but, simply perhaps in order to secure that help, conceals many things from him. And the happy one of the two is, when all is said, he who takes trouble, goes on a journey, executes a mission, but feels no anguish in his heart. I was at this moment the person that Robert had been at Donci\u00e8res when he thought that Rachel had abandoned him. \u201cVery well, just as you like; if I get my head bitten off, I accept the snub in advance for your sake. And even if it does seem a bit queer to make such an open bargain, I know that in our own set there are plenty of duchesses, even the most stuffy of them, who if you offered them thirty thousand francs Would do things far more difficult than telling their nieces not to stay in Touraine. Anyhow I am doubly glad to be doing you a service, since that is the only reason that will make you consent to see me. If I marry,\u201d he went on, \u201cdon\u2019t you think we might see more of one another, won\u2019t you look upon my house as your own. . . . \u201d He stopped short, the thought having suddenly occurred to him (as I supposed at the time) that, if I too were to marry, his wife would not be able to make an intimate friend of Albertine. And I remembered what the Cambremers had said to me as to the probability of his marrying a niece of the Prince de Guermantes. He consulted the time-table, and found that he could not leave Paris until the evening. Fran\u00e7oise inquired: \u201cAm I to take Mlle. Albertine\u2019s bed out of the study?\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d I said, \u201cyou must leave everything ready for her.\u201d I hoped that she would return any day and did not wish Fran\u00e7oise to suppose that there could be any doubt of her return. Albertine\u2019s departure must appear to have been arranged between ourselves, and not in any way to imply that she loved me less than before. But Fran\u00e7oise looked at me with an air, if not of incredulity, at any rate of doubt. She too had her alternative hypotheses. Her nostrils expanded, she could scent the quarrel, she must have felt it in the air for a long time past. And if she was not absolutely sure of it, this was perhaps because, like myself, she would hesitate to believe unconditionally what would have given her too much pleasure. Now the burden of the affair rested no longer upon my overwrought mind, but upon Saint-Loup. I became quite light-hearted because I had made a decision, because I could say to myself: \u201cI haven\u2019t lost any time, I have acted.\u201d Saint-Loup can barely have been in the train when in the hall I ran into Bloch, whose ring I had not heard, and so was obliged to let him stay with me for a minute. He had met me recently with Albertine (whom he had known at Balbec) on a day when she was in bad humour. \u201cI met M. Bontemps at dinner,\u201d he told me, \u201cand as I have a certain influence over him, I told him that I was grieved that his niece was not nicer to you, that he must make entreaties to her in that connexion.\u201d I boiled with rage; these entreaties, this compassion destroyed the whole effect of Saint-Loup\u2019s intervention and brought me into direct contact with Albertine herself whom I now seemed to be imploring to return. To make matters worse, Fran\u00e7oise, who was lingering in the hall, could hear every word. I heaped every imaginable reproach upon Bloch, telling him that I had never authorised him to do anything of the sort and that, besides, the whole thing was nonsense. Bloch, from that moment, continued to smile, less, I imagine, from joy than from self-consciousness at having made me angry. He laughingly expressed his surprise at having provoked such anger. Perhaps he said this hoping to minimise in my mind the importance of his indiscreet intervention, perhaps it Was because he was of a cowardly nature, and lived gaily and idly in an atmosphere of falsehood, as jelly-fish float upon the surface of the sea, perhaps because, even if he had not been of a different race, as other people can never place themselves at our point of view, they do not realise the magnitude of the injury that words uttered at random can do us. I had barely shewn him out, unable to think of any remedy for the mischief that he had done, when the bell rang again and Fran\u00e7oise brought me a summons from the head of the S\u00fbret\u00e9. The parents of the little girl whom I had brought into the house for an hour had decided to lodge a complaint against me for corruption of a child under the age of consent. There are moments in life when a sort of beauty is created by the multiplicity of the troubles that assail us, intertwined like Wagnerian leitmotiv, from the idea also, which then emerges, that events are not situated in the content of the reflexions portrayed in the wretched little mirror which the mind holds in front of it and which is called the future, that they are somewhere outside, and spring up as suddenly as a person who comes to accuse us of a crime. Even when left to itself, an event becomes modified, whether frustration amplifies it for us or satisfaction reduces it. But it is rarely unaccompanied. The feelings aroused by each event contradict one another, and there comes to a certain extent, as I felt when on my way to the head of the S\u00fbret\u00e9, an at least momentary revulsion which is as provocative of sentimental misery as fear. I found at the S\u00fbret\u00e9 the girl\u2019s parents who insulted me by saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t eat this sort of bread,\u201d and handed me back the five hundred francs which I declined to take, and the head of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 who, setting himself the inimitable example of the judicial facility in repartee, took hold of a word from each sentence that I uttered, a word which enabled him to make a witty and crushing retort. My innocence of the alleged crime was never taken into consideration, for that was the sole hypothesis which nobody was willing to accept for an instant. Nevertheless the difficulty of a conviction enabled me to escape with an extremely violent reprimand, while the parents were in the room. But as soon as they had gone, the head of the S\u00fbret\u00e9, who had a weakness for little girls, changed his tone and admonished me as one man to another: \u201cNext time, you must be more careful. Gad, you can\u2019t pick them up as easily as that, or you\u2019ll get into trouble. Anyhow, you can find dozens of girls better than that one, and far cheaper. It was a perfectly ridiculous amount to pay.\u201d I felt him to be so incapable of understanding me if I attempted to tell him the truth that without saying a word I took advantage of his permission to withdraw. Every passer-by, until I was safely at home, seemed to me an inspector appointed to spy upon my behaviour. But this leitmotiv, like that of my anger with Bloch, died away, leaving the field clear for that of Albertine\u2019s departure. And this took its place once more, but in an almost joyous tone now that Saint-Loup had started. Now that he had undertaken to go and see Mme. Bontemps, my sufferings had been dispelled. I believed that this was because I had taken action, I believed it sincerely, for we never know what we conceal in our heart of hearts. What really made me happy was not, as I supposed, that I had transferred my load of indecisions to Saint-Loup. I was not, for that matter, entirely wrong; the specific remedy for an unfortunate event (and three events out of four are unfortunate) is a decision; for its effect is that, by a sudden reversal of our thoughts, it interrupts the flow of those that come from the past event and prolong its vibration, and breaks that flow with a contrary flow of contrary thoughts, come from without, from the future. But these new thoughts are most of all beneficial to us when (and this was the case with the thoughts that assailed me at this moment), from the heart of that future, it is a hope that they bring us. What really made me so happy was the secret certainty that Saint-Loup\u2019s mission could not fail, Albertine was bound to return, I realised this; for not having received, on the following day, any answer from Saint-Loup, I began to suffer afresh. My decision, my transference to him of full power of action, were not therefore the cause of my joy, which, in that case, would have persisted; but rather the \u2018Success is certain\u2019 which had been in my mind when I said: \u201cCome what may.\u201d And the thought aroused by his delay, that, after all, his mission might not prove successful, was so hateful to me that I had lost my gaiety. It is in reality our anticipation, our hope of happy events that fills us with a joy which we ascribe to other causes and which ceases, letting us relapse into misery, if we are no longer so assured that what we desire will come to pass. It is always this invisible belief that sustains the edifice of our world of sensation, deprived of which it rocks from its foundations. We have seen that it created for us the merit or unimportance of other people, our excitement or boredom at seeing them. It creates similarly the possibility of enduring a grief which seems to us trivial, simply because we are convinced that it will presently be brought to an end, or its sudden enlargement until the presence of a certain person matters as much as, possibly more than our life itself. One thing however succeeded in making my heartache as keen as it had been at the first moment and (I am bound to admit) no longer was. This was when I read over again a passage in Albertine\u2019s letter. It is all very well our loving people, the pain of losing them, when in our isolation we are confronted with it alone, to which our mind gives, to a certain extent, whatever form it chooses, this pain is endurable and different from that other pain less human, less our own, as unforeseen and unusual as an accident in the moral world and in the region of our heart, which is caused not so much by the people themselves as by the manner in which we have learned that we are not to see them again. Albertine, I might think of her with gentle tears, accepting the fact that I should not be able to see her again this evening as I had seen her last night, but when I read over again: \u201cmy decision is irrevocable,\u201d that was another matter, it was like taking a dangerous drug which might give me a heart attack which I could not survive. There is in inanimate objects, in events, in farewell letters a special danger which amplifies and even alters the nature of the grief that people are capable of causing us. But this pain did not last long. I was, when all was said, so sure of Saint-Loup\u2019s skill, of his eventual success, Albertine\u2019s return seemed to me so certain that I asked myself whether I had had any reason to hope for it. Nevertheless, I rejoiced at the thought. Unfortunately for myself, who supposed the business with the S\u00fbret\u00e9 to be over and done with, Fran\u00e7oise came in to tell me that an inspector had called to inquire whether I was in the habit of having girls in the house, that the porter, supposing him to refer to Albertine, had replied in the affirmative, and that from that moment it had seemed that the house was being watched. In future it would be impossible for me ever to bring a little girl into the house to console me in my grief, without the risk of being put to shame in her eyes by the sudden intrusion of an inspector, and of her regarding me as a criminal. And at the same instant I realised how far more we live for certain ideas than we suppose, for this impossibility of my ever taking a little girl on my knee again seemed to me to destroy all the value of my life, but what was more I understood how comprehensible it is that people will readily refuse wealth and risk their lives, whereas we imagine that pecuniary interest and the fear of death rule the world. For if I had thought that even a little girl who was a complete stranger might by the arrival of a policeman, be given a bad impression of myself, how much more readily would I have committed suicide. And yet there was no possible comparison between the two degrees of suffering. Now in everyday life we never bear in mind that the people to whom we offer money, whom we threaten to kill, may have mistresses or merely friends, to whose esteem they attach importance, not to mention their own self-respect. But, all of a sudden, by a confusion of which I was not aware (I did not in fact remember that Albertine, being of full age, was free to live under my roof and even to be my mistress), it seemed to me that the charge of corrupting minors might include Albertine also. Thereupon my life appeared to me to be hedged in on every side. And when I thought that I had not lived chastely with her, I found in the punishment that had been inflicted upon me for having forced an unknown little girl to accept money, that relation which almost always exists in human sanctions, the effect of which is that there is hardly ever either a fair sentence or a judicial error, but a sort of compromise between the false idea that the judge forms of an innocent action and the culpable deeds of which he is unaware. But then when I thought that Albertine\u2019s return might involve me in the scandal of a sentence which would degrade me in her eyes and would perhaps do her, too, an injury which she would not forgive me, I ceased to look forward to her return, it terrified me. I would have liked to telegraph to her not to come back. And immediately, drowning everything else, the passionate desire for her return overwhelmed me. The fact was that having for an instant considered the possibility of telling her not to return and of living without her, all of a sudden, I felt myself on the contrary ready to abandon all travel, all pleasure, all work, if only Albertine might return! Ah, how my love for Albertine, the course of which I had supposed that I could foretell, on the analogy of my previous love for Gilberte, had developed in an entirely opposite direction! How impossible it was for me to live without seeing her! And with each of my actions, even the most trivial, since they had all been steeped before in the blissful atmosphere which was Albertine\u2019s presence, I was obliged in turn, with a fresh expenditure of energy, with the same grief, to begin again the apprenticeship of separation. Then the competition of other forms of life thrust this latest grief into the background, and, during those days which were the first days of spring, I even found, as I waited until Saint-Loup should have seen Mme. Bontemps, in imagining Venice and beautiful, unknown women, a few moments of pleasing calm. As soon as I was conscious of this, I felt in myself a panic terror. This calm which I had just enjoyed was the first apparition of that great occasional force which was to wage war in me against grief, against love, and would in the end prove victorious. This state of which I had just had a foretaste and had received the warning, was, for a moment only, what would in time to come be my permanent state, a life in which I should no longer be able to suffer on account of Albertine, in which I should no longer be in love with her. And my love, which had just seen and recognised the one enemy by whom it could be conquered, forgetfulness, began to tremble, like a lion which in the cage in which it has been confined has suddenly caught sight of the python that is about to devour it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I thought of Albertine all the time and never was Fran\u00e7oise, when she came into my room, quick enough in saying: \u201cThere are no letters,\u201d to curtail my anguish. From time to time I succeeded, by letting some current or other of ideas flow through my grief, in refreshing, in aerating to some slight extent the vitiated atmosphere of my heart, but at night, if I succeeded in going to sleep, then it was as though the memory of Albertine had been the drug that had procured my sleep, whereas the cessation of its influence would awaken me. I thought all the time of Albertine while I was asleep. It was a special sleep of her own that she gave me, and one in which, moreover, I should no longer have been at liberty, as when awake, to think of other things. Sleep and the memory of her were the two substances which I must mix together and take at one draught in order to put myself to sleep. When I was awake, moreover, my suffering went on increasing day by day instead of diminishing, not that oblivion was not performing its task, but because by the very fact of its doing so it favoured the idealisation of the regretted image and thereby the assimilation of my initial suffering to other analogous sufferings which intensified it. Still this image was endurable. But if all of a sudden I thought of her room, of her room in which the bed stood empty, of her piano, her motor-car, I lost all my strength, I shut my eyes, let my head droop upon my shoulder like a person who is about to faint. The sound of doors being opened hurt me almost as much because it was not she that was opening them\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When it was possible that a telegram might have come from Saint-Loup, Idared not ask: \u201cIs there a telegram?\u201d At length one did come, but brought with it only a postponement of any result, with the message: \u201cThe ladies have gone away for three days.\u201d No doubt, if I had endured the four days that had already elapsed since her departure, it was because I said to myself: \u201cIt is only a matter of time, by the end of the week she will be here.\u201d But this argument did not alter the fact that for my heart, for my body, the action to be performed was the same: living without her, returning home and not finding her in the house, passing the door of her room \u2014 as for opening it, I had not yet the courage to do that \u2014 knowing that she was not inside, going to bed without having said good night to her, such were the tasks that my heart had been obliged to accomplish in their terrible entirety, and for all the world as though I had not been going to see Albertine. But the fact that my heart had already performed this daily task four times proved that it was now capable of continuing to perform it. And soon, perhaps, the consideration which helped me to go on living in this fashion \u2014 the prospect of Albertine\u2019s return \u2014 I should cease to feel any need of it (I should be able to say to myself: \u201cShe is never coming back,\u201d and remain alive all the same as I had already been living for the last four days), like a cripple who has recovered the use of his feet and can dispense with his crutches. No doubt when I came home at night I still found, taking my breath away, stifling me in the vacuum of solitude, the memories placed end to end in an interminable series of all the evenings upon which Albertine had been waiting for me; but already I found in this series my memory of last night, of the night before and of the two previous evenings, that is to say the memory of the four nights that had passed since Albertine\u2019s departure, during which I had remained without her, alone, through which nevertheless I had lived, four nights already, forming a string of memories that was very slender compared with the other, but to which every new day would perhaps add substance. I shall say nothing of the letter conveying a declaration of affection which I received at this time from a niece of Mme. de Guermantes, considered the prettiest girl in Paris, nor of the overtures made to me by the Duc de Guermantes on behalf of her parents, resigned, in their anxiety to secure their daughter\u2019s happiness, to the inequality of the match, to an apparent misalliance. Such incidents which might prove gratifying to our self-esteem are too painful when we are in love. We feel a desire, but shrink from the indelicacy of communicating them to her who has a less flattering opinion of us, nor would that opinion be altered by the knowledge that we are able to inspire one that is very different. What the Duke\u2019s niece wrote to me could only have made Albertine angry. From the moment of waking, when I picked my grief up again at the point which I had reached when I fell asleep, like a book which had been shut for a while but which I would keep before my eyes until night, it could be only with some thought relating to Albertine that all my sensation would be brought into harmony, whether it came to me from without or from within. The bell rang: it is a letter from her, it is she herself perhaps! If I felt myself in better health, not too miserable, I was no longer jealous, I no longer had any grievance against her, I would have liked to see her at once, to kiss her, to live happily with her ever after. The act of telegraphing to her: \u201cCome at once\u201d seemed to me to have become a perfectly simple thing, as though my fresh mood had changed not merely my inclinations but things external to myself, had made them more easy. If I was in a sombre mood, all my anger with her revived, I no longer felt any desire to kiss her, I felt how impossible it was that she could ever make me happy, I sought only to do her harm and to prevent her from belonging to other people. But these two opposite moods had an identical result: it was essential that she should return as soon as possible. And yet, however keen my joy at the moment of her return, I felt that very soon the same difficulties would crop up again and that to seek happiness in the satisfaction of a moral desire was as fatuous as to attempt to reach the horizon by walking straight ahead. The farther the desire advances, the farther does true possession withdraw. So that if happiness or at least freedom from suffering can be found it is not the satisfaction, but the gradual reduction, the eventual extinction of our desire that we must seek. We attempt to see the person whom we love, we ought to attempt not to see her, oblivion alone brings about an ultimate extinction of desire. And I imagine that if an author were to publish truths of this sort he would dedicate the book that contained them to a woman to whom he would thus take pleasure in returning, saying to her: \u201cThis book is yours.\u201d And thus, while telling the truth in his book, he would be lying in his dedication, for he will attach to the book\u2019s being hers only the importance that he attaches to the stone that came to him from her which will remain precious to him only so long as he is in love with her. The bonds that unite another person to ourselves exist only in our mind. Memory as it grows fainter relaxes them, and notwithstanding the illusion by which we would fain be cheated and with which, out of love, friendship, politeness, deference, duty, we cheat other people, we exist alone. Man is the creature that cannot emerge from himself, that knows his fellows only in himself; when he asserts the contrary, he is lying. And I should have been in such terror (had there been anyone capable of taking it) of somebody\u2019s robbing me of this need of her, this love for her, that I convinced myself that it had a value in my life. To be able to hear uttered, without being either fascinated or pained by them, the names of the stations through which the train passed on its way to Touraine, would have seemed to me a diminution of myself (for no other reason really than that it would have proved that Albertine was ceasing to interest me); it was just as well, I told myself, that by incessantly asking myself what she could be doing, thinking, longing, at every moment, whether she intended, whether she was going to return, I should be keeping open that communicating door which love had installed in me, and feeling another person\u2019s mind flood through open sluices the reservoir which must not again become stagnant. Presently, as Saint-Loup remained silent, a subordinate anxiety \u2014 my expectation of a further telegram, of a telephone call from him \u2014 masked the other, my uncertainty as to the result, whether Albertine was going to return. Listening for every sound in expectation of the telegram became so intolerable that I felt that, whatever might be its contents, the arrival of the telegram, which was the only thing of which I could think at the moment, would put an end to my sufferings. But when at length I had received a telegram from Robert in which he informed me that he had seen Mme. Bontemps, but that, notwithstanding all his precautions, Albertine had seen him, and that this had upset everything, I burst out in a torrent of fury and despair, for this was what I would have done anything in the world to prevent. Once it came to Albertine\u2019s knowledge, Saint-Loup\u2019s mission gave me an appearance of being dependent upon her which could only dissuade her from returning, my horror of which was, as it happened, all that I had retained of the pride that my love had boasted in Gilberte\u2019s day and had since lost. I cursed Robert. Then I told myself that, if this attempt had failed, I would try another. Since man is able to influence the outer world, how, if I brought into play cunning, intelligence, pecuniary advantage, affection, should I fail to succeed in destroying this appalling fact: Albertine\u2019s absence. We believe that according to our desire we are able to change the things around about us, we believe this because otherwise we can see no favourable solution. We forget the solution that generally comes to pass and is also favourable: we do not succeed in changing things according to our desire, but gradually our desire changes. The situation that we hoped to change because it was intolerable becomes unimportant. We have not managed to surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us past it, and then if we turn round to gaze at the remote past, we can barely catch sight of it, so imperceptible has it become. In the flat above ours, one of the neighbours was strumming songs. I applied their words, which I knew, to Albertine and myself, and was stirred by so profound a sentiment that I began to cry. The words were:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cH\u00e9las, l\u2019oiseau qui fuit ce qu\u2019il croit l\u2019esclavage\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0d\u2019un vol d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9 revient battre au vitrage\u201d\n\nAnd the death of Manon:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cManon, r\u00e9ponds-moi donc\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seul amour de mon \u00e2me, je n\u2019ai su qu\u2019aujourd\u2019hui\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0la bont\u00e9 de ton coeur.\u201d\n\nSince Manon returned to Des Grieux, it seemed to me that I was to Albertine the one and only love of her life. Alas, it is probable that, if she had been listening at that moment to the same air, it would not have been myself that she would have cherished under the name of Des Grieux, and, even if the idea had occurred to her, the memory of myself would have checked her emotion on hearing this music, albeit it was, although better and more distinguished, just the sort of music that she admired. As for myself, I had not the courage to abandon myself to so pleasant a train of thought, to imagine Albertine calling me her \u2018heart\u2019s only love\u2019 and realising that she had been mistaken over what she \u2018had thought to be bondage.\u2019 I knew that we can never read a novel without giving its heroine the form and features of the woman with whom we are in love. But be the ending as happy as it may, our love has not advanced an inch and, when we have shut the book, she whom we love and who has come to us at last in its pages, loves us no better in real life. In a fit of fury, I telegraphed to Saint-Loup to return as quickly as possible to Paris, so as to avoid at least the appearance of an aggravating insistence upon a mission which I had been so anxious to keep secret. But even before he had returned in obedience to my instructions it was from Albertine herself that I received the following letter:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear, you have sent your friend Saint-Loup to my aunt, which was foolish. My dear boy, if you needed me why did you not write to me myself, I should have been only too delighted to come back, do not let us have any more of these absurd complications.\u201d \u201cI should have been only too delighted to come back!\u201d If she said this, it must mean that she regretted her departure, and was only seeking an excuse to return. So that I had merely to do what she said, to write to her that I needed her, and she would return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was going, then, to see her again, her, the Albertine of Balbec (for since her departure this was what she had once more become to me; like a sea-shell to which we cease to pay any attention while we have it on the chest of drawers in our room, once we have parted with it, either by giving it away or by losing it, and begin to think about it, a thing which we had ceased to do, she recalled to me all the joyous beauty of the blue mountains of the sea). And it was not only she that had become a creature of the imagination, that is to say desirable, life with her had become an imaginary life, that is to a life set free from all difficulties, so that I said to myself: \u201cHow happy we are going to be!\u201d But, now that I was assured of her return, I must not appear to be seeking to hasten it, but must on the contrary efface the bad impression left by Saint-Loup\u2019s intervention, which I could always disavow later on by saying that he had acted upon his own initiative, because he had always been in favour of our marriage. Meanwhile, I read her letter again, and was nevertheless disappointed when I saw how little there is of a person in a letter. Doubtless the characters traced on the paper express our thoughts, as do also our features: it is still a thought of some kind that we see before us. But all the same, in the person, the thought is not apparent to us until it has been diffused through the expanded water-lily of her face. This modifies it considerably. And it is perhaps one of the causes of our perpetual disappointments in love, this perpetual deviation which brings it about that, in response to our expectation of the ideal person with whom we are in love, each meeting provides us with a person in flesh and blood in whom there is already so little trace of our dream. And then when we demand something of this person, we receive from her a letter in which even of the person very little remains, as in the letters of an algebraical formula there no longer remains the precise value of the arithmetical ciphers, which themselves do not contain the qualities of the fruit or flowers that they enumerate. And yet love, the beloved object, her letters, are perhaps nevertheless translations (unsatisfying as it may be to pass from one to the other) of the same reality, since the letter seems to us inadequate only while we are reading it, but we have been sweating blood until its arrival, and it is sufficient to calm our anguish, if not to appease, with its tiny black symbols, our desire which knows that it contains after all only the equivalent of a word, a smile, a kiss, not the things themselves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I wrote to Albertine:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear, I was just about to write to you, and I thank you for telling me that if I had been in need of you you would have come at once; it is like you to have so exalted a sense of devotion to an old friend, which can only increase my regard for you. But no, I did not ask and I shall not ask you to return; our meeting \u2014 for a long time to come \u2014 might not be painful, perhaps, to you, a heartless girl. To me whom at times you have thought so cold, it would be most painful. Life has driven us apart. You have made a decision which I consider very wise, and which you have made at the right moment, with a marvellous presentiment, for you left me on the day on which I had just received my mother\u2019s consent to my asking you to marry me. I would have told you this when I awoke, when I received her letter (at the same moment as yours). Perhaps you would have been afraid of distressing me by leaving immediately after that. And we should perhaps have united our lives in what would have been for us (who knows?) misery. If this is what was in store for us, then I bless you for your wisdom. We should lose all the fruit of it were we to meet again. This is not to say that I should not find it a temptation. But I claim no great credit for resisting it. You know what an inconstant person I am and how quickly I forget. You have told me often, I am first and foremost a man of habit. The habits which I am beginning to form in your absence are not as yet very strong. Naturally, at this moment, the habits that I had when you were with me, habits which your departure has upset, are still the stronger. They will not remain so for very long. For that reason, indeed, I had thought of taking advantage of these last few days in which our meeting would not yet be for me what it will be in a fortnight\u2019s time, perhaps even sooner (forgive my frankness): a disturbance \u2014 I had thought of taking advantage of them, before the final oblivion, in order to settle certain little material questions with you, in which you might, as a good and charming friend, have rendered a service to him who for five minutes imagined himself your future husband. As I never expected that my mother would approve, as on the other hand I desired that we should each of us enjoy all that liberty of which you had too generously and abundantly made a sacrifice which might be admissible had we been living together for a few weeks, but would have become as hateful to you as to myself now that we were to spend the rest of our lives together (it almost hurts me to think as I write to you that this nearly happened, that the news came only a moment too late), I had thought of organising our existence in the most independent manner possible, and, to begin with, I wished you to have that yacht in which you could go cruising while I, not being well enough to accompany you, would wait for you at the port (I had written to Elstir to ask for his advice, since you admire his taste), and on land I wished you to have a motor-car to yourself, for your very own, in which you could go out, could travel wherever you chose. The yacht was almost ready; it is named, after a wish that you expressed at Balbec, le Cygne. And remembering that your favourite make of car was the Rolls, I had ordered one. But now that we are never to meet again, as I have no hope of persuading you to accept either the vessel or the car (to me they would be quite useless), I had thought \u2014 as I had ordered them through an agent, but in your name \u2014 that you might perhaps by countermanding them, yourself, save me the expense of the yacht and the car which are no longer required. But this, and many other matters, would need to be discussed. Well, I find that so long as I am capable of falling in love with you again, which will not be for long, it would be madness, for the sake of a sailing-vessel and a Rolls-Royce, to meet again and to risk the happiness of your life since you have decided that it lies in your living apart from myself. No, I prefer to keep the Rolls and even the yacht. And as I shall make no use of them and they are likely to remain for ever, one in its dock, dismantled, the other in its garage, I shall have engraved upon the yacht (Heavens, I am afraid of misquoting the title and committing a heresy which would shock you) those lines of Mallarm\u00e9 which you used to like:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Un cygne d\u2019autrefois se souvient que c\u2019est lui\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Magnifique mais qui sans espoir se d\u00e9livre\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pour n\u2019avoir pas chant\u00e9 la r\u00e9gion o\u00f9 vivre\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quand du st\u00e9rile hiver a resplendi l\u2019ennui\nYou remember \u2014 it is the poem that begins:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Le vierge, le vivace et le bel aujourd\u2019hui\n\nAlas, to-day is no longer either virginal or fair. But the men who know, as I know, that they will very soon make of it an endurable \u2018to-morrow\u2019 are seldom endurable themselves. As for the Rolls, it would deserve rather those other lines of the same poet which you said you could not understand:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dis si je ne suis pas joyeux\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tonnerre et rubis aux moyeux\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De voir en l\u2019air que ce feu troue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Avec des royaumes \u00e9pars\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comme mourir pourpre la roue\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Du seul vesp\u00e9ral de mes chars\n\n\u201cFarewell for ever, my little Albertine, and thanks once again for the charming drive which we took on the eve of our parting. I retain a very pleasant memory of it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cP.S. I make no reference to what you tell me of the alleged suggestions which Saint-Loup (whom I do not for a moment believe to be in Touraine) may have made to your aunt. It is just like a Sherlock Holmes story. For what do you take me?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No doubt, just as I had said in the past to Albertine: \u201cI am not in love with you,\u201d in order that she might love me; \u201cI forget people when I do not see them,\u201d in order that she might come often to see me; \u201cI have decided to leave you,\u201d in order to forestall any idea of a parting, now it was because I was absolutely determined that she must return within a week that\u2019I said to her: \u201cFarewell for ever\u201d; it was because I wished to see her again that I said to her: \u201cI think it would be dangerous to see you\u201d; it was because living apart from her seemed to me worse than death that I wrote to her: \u201cYou were right, we should be wretched together.\u201d Alas, this false letter, when I wrote it in order to appear not to be dependent upon her and also to enjoy the pleasure of saying certain things which could arouse emotion only in myself and not in her, I ought to have foreseen from the start that it was possible that it would result in a negative response, that is to say one which confirmed what I had said; that this was indeed probable, for even had Albertine been less intelligent than she was, she would never have doubted for an instant that what I said to her was untrue. Indeed without pausing to consider the intentions that I expressed in this letter, the mere fact of my writing it, even if it had not been preceded by Saint-Loup\u2019s intervention, was enough to prove to her that I desired her return and to prompt her to let me become more and more inextricably ensnared. Then, having foreseen the possibility of a reply in the negative, I ought also to have foreseen that this reply would at once revive in its fullest intensity my love for Albertine. And I ought, still before posting my letter, to have asked myself whether, in the event of Albertine\u2019s replying in the same tone and refusing to return, I should have sufficient control over my grief to force myself to remain silent, not to telegraph to her: \u201cCome back,\u201d not to send her some other messenger, which, after I had written to her that we would not meet again, would make it perfectly obvious that I could not get on without her, and would lead to her refusing more emphatically than ever, whereupon I, unable to endure my anguish for another moment, would go down to visit her and might, for all I knew, be refused admission. And, no doubt, this would have been, after three enormous blunders, the worst of all, after which there would be nothing left but to take my life in front of her house. But the disastrous manner in which the psychopathic universe is constructed has decreed that the clumsy action, the action which we ought most carefully to have avoided, should be precisely the action that will calm us, the action that, opening before us, until we learn its result, fresh avenues of hope, relieves us for the moment of the intolerable pain which a refusal has aroused in us. With the result that, when the pain is too keen, we dash headlong into the blunder that consists in writing, sending somebody to intercede, going in person, proving that we cannot get on without the woman we love. But I foresaw nothing of all this. The probable result of my letter seemed to me on the contrary to be that of making Albertine return to me at once. And so, as I thought of this result, I greatly enjoyed writing the letter. But at the same time I had not ceased, while writing it, from shedding tears; partly, at first, in the same way as upon the day when I had acted a pretence of separation, because, as the words represented for me the idea which they expressed to me, albeit they were aimed in the opposite direction (uttered mendaciously because my pride forbade me to admit that I was in love), they carried their own load of sorrow. But also because I felt that the idea contained a grain of truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As this letter seemed to me to be certain of its effect, I began to regret that I had sent it. For as I pictured to myself the return (so natural, after all), of Albertine, immediately all the reasons which made our marriage a thing disastrous to myself returned in their fullest force. I hoped that she would refuse to come back. I was engaged in calculating that my liberty, my whole future depended upon her refusal, that I had been mad to write to her, that I ought to have retrieved my letter which, alas, had gone, when Fran\u00e7oise, with the newspaper which she had just brought upstairs, handed it back to me. She was not certain how many stamps it required. But immediately I changed my mind; I hoped that Albertine would not return, but I wished the decision to come from her, so as to put an end to my anxiety, and I handed the letter back to Fran\u00e7oise. I opened the newspaper; it announced a performance by Berma. Then I remembered the two different attitudes in which I had listened to Ph\u00e8dre, and it was now in a third attitude that I thought of the declaration scene. It seemed to me that what I had so often repeated to myself, and had heard recited in the theatre, was the statement of the laws of which I must make experience in my life. There are in our soul things to which we do not realise how strongly we are attached. Or else, if we live without them, it is because we put off from day to day, from fear of failure, or of being made to suffer, entering into possession of them. This was what had happened to me in the case of Gilberte when I thought that I had given her up. If before the moment in which we are entirely detached from these things \u2014 a moment long subsequent to that in which we suppose ourselves to have been detached from them \u2014 the girl with whom we are in love becomes, for instance, engaged to some one else, we are mad, we can no longer endure the life which appeared to us to be so sorrowfully calm. Or else, if we are in control of the situation, we feel that she is a burden, we would gladly be rid of her. Which was what had happened to me in the case of Albertine. But let a sudden departure remove the unloved creature from us, we are unable to survive. But did not the plot of Ph\u00e8dre combine these two cases? Hippolyte is about to leave. Ph\u00e8dre, who until then has taken care to court his hostility, from a scruple of conscience, she says, or rather the poet makes her say, because she is unable to foresee the consequences and feels that she is not loved, Ph\u00e8dre can endure the situation no longer. She comes to him to confess her love, and this was the scene which I had so often repeated to myself:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On dit qu\u2019un prompt d\u00e9part vous \u00e9loigne de nous\n\nDoubtless this reason for the departure of Hippolyte is less decisive, we may suppose, than the death of Th\u00e9s\u00e9e. And similarly when, a few lines farther on, Ph\u00e8dre pretends for a moment that she has been misunderstood:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aurais-je perdu tout le soin de ma gloire?\n\nWe may suppose that it is because Hippolyte has repulsed her declaration\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Madame, oubliez-vous\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Que Th\u00e9s\u00e9e est mon p\u00e8re, et qu\u2019il est votre \u00e9poux?\n\nBut there would not have been this indignation unless, in the moment of a consummated bliss, Ph\u00e8dre could have had the same feeling that it amounted to little or nothing. Whereas, as soon as she sees that it is not to be consummated, that Hippolyte thinks that he has misunderstood her and makes apologies, then, like myself when I decided to give my letter back to Fran\u00e7oise, she decides that the refusal must come from him, decides to stake everything upon his answer:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ah! cruel, tu m\u2019as trop entendue\n\nAnd there is nothing, not even the harshness with which, as I had been told, Swann had treated Odette, or I myself had treated Albertine, a harshness which substituted for the original love a new love composed of pity, emotion, of the need of effusion, which is only a variant of the former love, that is not to be found also in this scene:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tu me ha\u00efssais plus, je ne t\u2019aimais pas moins\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tes malheurs te pr\u00eataient encor de nouveaux charmes\n\nWhat proves that it is not to the \u2018thought of her own fame\u2019 that Ph\u00e8dre attaches most importance is that she would forgive Hippolyte and turn a deaf ear to the advice of Oenone had she not learned at the same instant that Hippolyte was in love with Aricie. So it is that jealousy, which in love is equivalent to the loss of all happiness, outweighs any loss of reputation. It is then that she allows Oenone (which is merely a name for the baser part of herself) to slander Hippolyte without taking upon herself the \u2018burden of his defence\u2019 and thus sends the man who will have none of her to a fate the calamities of which are no consolation, however, to herself, since her own suicide follows immediately upon the death of Hippolyte. Thus at least it was, with a diminution of the part played by all the \u2018Jansenist scruples,\u2019 as Bergotte would have said, which Racine ascribed to Ph\u00e8dre to make her less guilty, that this scene appeared to me, a sort of prophecy of the amorous episodes in my own life. These reflexions had, however, altered nothing of my determination, and I handed my letter to Fran\u00e7oise so that she might post it after all, in order to carry into effect that appeal to Albertine which seemed to me to be indispensable, now that I had learned that my former attempt had failed. And no doubt we are wrong when we suppose that the accomplishment of our desire is a small matter, since as soon as we believe that it cannot be realised we become intent upon it once again, and decide that it was not worth our while to pursue it only when we are quite certain that our attempt will not fail. And yet we are right also. For if this accomplishment, if our happiness appear of small account only in the light of certainty, nevertheless they are an unstable element from which only trouble can arise. And our trouble will be all the greater the more completely our desire will have been accomplished, all the more impossible to endure when our happiness has been, in defiance of the law of nature, prolonged for a certain period, when it has received the consecration of habit. In another sense as well, these two tendencies, by which I mean that which made me anxious that my letter should be posted, and, when I thought that it had gone, my regret that I had written it, have each of them a certain element of truth. In the case of the first, it is easily comprehensible that we should go in pursuit of our happiness \u2014 or misery \u2014 and that at the same time we should hope to keep before us, by this latest action which is about to involve us in its consequences, a state of expectancy which does not leave us in absolute despair, in a word that we should seek to convert into other forms, which, we imagine, must be less painful to us, the malady from which we are suffering. But the other tendency is no less important, for, born of our belief in the success of our enterprise, it is simply an anticipation of the disappointment which we should very soon feel in the presence of a satisfied desire, our regret at having fixed for ourselves, at the expense of other forms which are necessarily excluded, this form of happiness. I had given my letter to Fran\u00e7oise and had asked her to go out at once and post it. As soon as the letter had gone, I began once more to think of Albertine\u2019s return as imminent. It did not fail to introduce into my mind certain pleasing images which neutralised somewhat by their attractions the dangers that I foresaw in her return. The pleasure, so long lost, of having her with me was intoxicating\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Time passes, and gradually everything that we have said in falsehood becomes true; I had learned this only too well with Gilberte; the indifference that I had feigned when I could never restrain my tears had ended by becoming real; gradually life, as I told Gilberte in a lying formula which retrospectively had become true, life had driven us apart. I recalled this, I said to myself: \u201cIf Albertine allows an interval to elapse, my lies will become the truth. And now that the worst moments are over, ought I not to hope that she will allow this month to pass without returning? If she returns, I shall have to renounce the true life which certainly I am not in a fit state to enjoy as yet, but which as time goes on may begin to offer me attractions while my memory of Albertine grows fainter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have said that oblivion was beginning to perform its task. But one of the effects of oblivion was precisely \u2014 since it meant that many of Albertine\u2019s less pleasing aspects, of the boring hours that I had spent with her, no longer figured in my memory, ceased therefore to be reasons for my desiring that she should not be with me as I used to wish when she was still in the house \u2014 that it gave me a curtailed impression of her, enhanced by all the love that I had ever felt for other women. In this novel aspect of her, oblivion which nevertheless was engaged upon making me accustomed to our separation, made me, by shewing me a more attractive Albertine, long all the more for her return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since her departure, very often, when I was confident that I shewed no trace of tears, I would ring for Fran\u00e7oise and say to her: \u201cWe must make sure that Mademoiselle Albertine hasn\u2019t left anything behind her. Don\u2019t forget to do her room, it must be ready for her when she comes.\u201d Or merely: \u201cOnly the other day Mademoiselle Albertine said to me, let me think now, it was the day before she left. . . . \u201d I was anxious to diminish Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s abominable pleasure at Albertine\u2019s departure by letting her see that it was not to be prolonged. I was anxious also to let Fran\u00e7oise see that I was not afraid to speak of this departure, to proclaim it \u2014 like certain generals who describe a forced retreat as a strategic withdrawal in conformity with a prearranged plan \u2014 as intended by myself, as constituting an episode the true meaning of which I concealed for the moment, but in no way implying the end of my friendship with Albertine. By repeating her name incessantly I sought in short to introduce, like a breath of air, something of herself into that room in which her departure had left a vacuum, in which I could no longer breathe. Then, moreover, we seek to reduce the dimensions of our grief by making it enter into our everyday speech between ordering a suit of clothes and ordering dinner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While she was doing Albertine\u2019s room, Fran\u00e7oise, out of curiosity, opened the drawer of a little rosewood table in which my mistress used to put away the ornaments which she discarded when she went to bed. \u201cOh! Monsieur, Mademoiselle Albertine has forgotten to take her rings, she has left them in the drawer.\u201d My first impulse was to say: \u201cWe must send them after her.\u201d But this would make me appear uncertain of her return. \u201cVery well,\u201d I replied after a moment of silence, \u201cit is hardly worth while sending them to her as she is coming back so soon. Give them to me, I shall think about it.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise handed me the rings with a distinct misgiving. She loathed Albertine, but, regarding me in her own image, supposed that one could not hand me a letter in the handwriting of my mistress without the risk of my opening it. I took the rings. \u201cMonsieur must take care not to lose them,\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, \u201csuch beauties as they are! I don\u2019t know who gave them to her, if it was Monsieur or some one else, but I can see that it was some one rich, who had good taste!\u201d \u201cIt was not I,\u201d I assured her, \u201cbesides, they don\u2019t both come from the same person, one was given her by her aunt and the other she bought for herself.\u201d \u201cNot from the same person!\u201d Fran\u00e7oise exclaimed, \u201cMonsieur must be joking, they are just alike, except that one of them has had a ruby added to it, there\u2019s the same eagle on both, the same initials inside. . . . \u201d I do not know whether Fran\u00e7oise was conscious of the pain that she was causing me, but she began at this point to curve her lips in a smile which never left them. \u201cWhat, the same eagle? You are talking nonsense. It is true that the one without the ruby has an eagle upon it, but on the other it is a sort of man\u2019s head.\u201d \u201cA man\u2019s head, where did Monsieur discover that? I had only to put on my spectacles to see at once that it was one of the eagle\u2019s wings; if Monsieur will take his magnifying glass, he will see the other wing on the other side, the head and the beak in the middle. You can count the feathers. Oh, it\u2019s a fine piece of work.\u201d My intense anxiety to know whether Albertine had lied to me made me forget that I ought to maintain a certain dignity in Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s presence and deny her the wicked pleasure that she felt, if not in torturing me, at least in disparaging my mistress. I remained breathless while Fran\u00e7oise went to fetch my magnifying glass, I took it from her, asked her to shew me the eagle upon the ring with the ruby, she had no difficulty in making me see the wings, conventionalised in the same way as upon the other ring, the feathers, cut separately in relief, the head. She pointed out to me also the similar inscriptions, to which, it is true, others were added upon the ring with the ruby. And on the inside of both was Albertine\u2019s monogram. \u201cBut I\u2019m surprised that it should need all this to make Monsieur see that the rings are the same,\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise. \u201cEven without examining them, you can see that it is the same style, the same way of turning the gold, the same form. As soon as I looked at them I could have sworn that they came from the same place. You can tell it as you can tell the dishes of a good cook.\u201d And indeed, to the curiosity of a servant, whetted by hatred and trained to observe details with a startling precision, there had been added, to assist her in this expert criticism, the taste that she had, that same taste in fact which she shewed in her cookery and which was intensified perhaps, as I had noticed when we left Paris for Balbec, in her attire, by the coquetry of a woman who was once good-looking, who has studied the jewels and dresses of other women. I might have taken the wrong box of medicine and, instead of swallowing a few capsules of veronal on a day when I felt that I had drunk too many cups of tea, might have swallowed as many capsules of caffeine; my heart would not have throbbed more violently. I asked Fran\u00e7oise to leave the room. I would have liked to see Albertine immediately. To my horror at her falsehood, to my jealousy of the unknown donor, was added grief that she should have allowed herself to accept such presents. I made her even more presents, it is true, but a woman whom we are keeping does not seem to us to be a kept woman so long as we do not know that she is being kept by other men. And yet since I had continued to spend so much money upon her, I had taken her notwithstanding this moral baseness; this baseness I had maintained in her, I had perhaps increased, perhaps created it. Then, just as we have the faculty of inventing fairy tales to soothe our grief, just as we manage, when we are dying of hunger, to persuade ourselves that a stranger is going to leave us a fortune of a hundred millions, I imagined Albertine in my arms, explaining to me in a few words that it was because of the similarity of its workmanship that she had bought the second ring, that it was she who had had her initials engraved on it. But this explanation was still feeble, it had not yet had time to thrust into my mind its beneficent roots, and my grief could not be so quickly soothed. And I reflected that many men who tell their friends that their mistresses are very kind to them must suffer similar torments. Thus it is that they lie to others and to themselves. They do not altogether lie; they do spend in the woman\u2019s company hours that are really pleasant; but think of all that the kindness which their mistresses shew them before their friends and which enables them to boast, and of all that the kindness which their mistresses shew when they are alone with them, and which enables their lovers to bless them, conceal of unrecorded hours in which the lover has suffered, doubted, sought everywhere in vain to discover the truth! It is to such sufferings that we attach the pleasure of loving, of delighting in the most insignificant remarks of a woman, which we know to be insignificant, but which we perfume with her scent. At this moment I could no longer find any delight in inhaling, by an act of memory, the scent of Albertine. Thunderstruck, holding the two rings in my hand, I stared at that pitiless eagle whose beak was rending my heart, whose wings, chiselled in high relief, had borne away the confidence that I retained in my mistress, in whose claws my tortured mind was unable to escape for an instant from the incessantly recurring questions as to the stranger whose name the eagle doubtless symbolised, without however allowing me to decipher it, whom she had doubtless loved in the past, and whom she had doubtless seen again not so long ago, since it was upon that day so pleasant, so intimate, of our drive together through the Bois that I had seen, for the first time, the second ring, that upon which the eagle appeared to be dipping his beak in the bright blood of the ruby\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If, however, morning, noon and night, I never ceased to grieve over Albertine\u2019s departure, this did not mean that I was thinking only of her. For one thing, her charm having acquired a gradual ascendancy over things which, in course of time, were entirely detached from her, but were nevertheless electrified by the same emotion that she used to give me, if something made me think of Incarville or of the Verdurins, or of some new part that L\u00e9a was playing, a flood of suffering would overwhelm me. For another thing, what I myself called thinking of Albertine, was thinking of how I might bring her back, of how I might join her, might know what she was doing. With the result that if, during those hours of incessant martyrdom, there had been an illustrator present to represent the images which accompanied my sufferings, you would have seen pictures of the Gare d\u2019Orsay, of the bank notes offered to Mme. Bontemps, of Saint-Loup stooping over the sloping desk of a telegraph office at which he was writing out a telegram for myself, never the picture of Albertine. Just as, throughout the whole course of our life, our egoism sees before it all the time the objects that are of interest to ourselves, but never takes in that Ego itself which is incessantly observing them, so the desire which directs our actions descends towards them, but does not reascend to itself, whether because, being unduly utilitarian, it plunges into the action and disdains all knowledge of it, or because we have been looking to the future to compensate for the disappointments of the past, or because the inertia of our mind urges it down the easy slope of imagination, rather than make it reascend the steep slope of introspection. As a matter of fact, in those hours of crisis in which we would stake our whole life, in proportion as the person upon whom it depends reveals more clearly the immensity of the place that she occupies in our life, leaving nothing in the world which is not overthrown by her, so the image of that person diminishes until it is not longer perceptible. In everything we find the effect of her presence in the emotion that we feel; herself, the cause, we do not find anywhere. I was during these days so incapable of forming any picture of Albertine that I could almost have believed that I was not in love with her, just as my mother, in the moments of desperation in which she was incapable of ever forming any picture of my grandmother (save once in the chance encounter of a dream the importance of which she felt so intensely that she employed all the strength that remained to her in her sleep to make it last), might have accused and did in fact accuse herself of not regretting her mother, whose death had been a mortal blow to her but whose features escaped her memory\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why should I have supposed that Albertine did not care for women? Because she had said, especially of late, that she did not care for them: but did not our life rest upon a perpetual lie? Never once had she said to me: \u201cWhy is it that I cannot go out when and where I choose, why do you always ask other people what I have been doing?\u201d And yet, after all, the conditions of her life were so unusual that she must have asked me this had she not herself guessed the reason. And to my silence as to the causes of her claustration, was it not comprehensible that she should correspond with a similar and constant silence as to her perpetual desires, her innumerable memories and hopes? Fran\u00e7oise looked as though she knew that I was lying when I made an allusion to the imminence of Albertine\u2019s return. And her belief seemed to be founded upon something more than that truth which generally guided our old housekeeper, that masters do not like to be humiliated in front of their servants, and allow them to know only so much of the truth as does not depart too far from a flattering fiction, calculated to maintain respect for themselves. This time, Fran-\u00e7oise\u2019s belief seemed to be founded upon something else, as though she had herself aroused, kept alive the distrust in Albertine\u2019s mind, stimulated her anger, driven her in short to the point at which she could predict her departure as inevitable. If this was true, my version of a temporary absence, of which I had known and approved, could be received with nothing but incredulity by Fran\u00e7oise. But the idea that she had formed of Albertine\u2019s venal nature, the exasperation with which, in her hatred, she multiplied the \u2018profit\u2019 that Albertine was supposed to be making out of myself, might to some extent give a check to that certainty. And so when in her hearing I made an allusion, as if to something that was altogether natural, to Albertine\u2019s immediate return, Fran\u00e7oise would look me in the face, to see whether I was not inventing, in the same way in which, when the butler, to make her angry, read out to her, changing the words, some political news which she hesitated to believe, as for instance the report of the closing of the churches and expulsion of the clergy, even from the other end of the kitchen, and without being able to read it, she would fix her gaze instinctively and greedily upon the paper, as though she had been able to see whether the report was really there\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Fran\u00e7oise saw that after writing a long letter I put on the envelope the address of Mme. Bontemps, this alarm, hitherto quite vague, that Albertine might return, increased in her. It grew to a regular consternation when one morning she had to bring me with the rest of my mail a letter upon the envelope of which she had recognised Albertine\u2019s handwriting. She asked herself whether Albertine\u2019s departure had not been a mere make-believe, a supposition which distressed her twice over as making definitely certain for the future Albertine\u2019s presence in the house, and as bringing upon myself, and thereby, in so far as I was Fran-\u00e7oise\u2019s master, upon herself, the humiliation of having been tricked by Albertine. However great my impatience to read her letter, I could not refrain from studying for a moment Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s eyes from which all hope had fled, inducing from this presage the imminence of Albertine\u2019s return, as a lover of winter sports concludes with joy that the cold weather is at hand when he sees the swallows fly south. At length Fran\u00e7oise left me, and when I had made sure that she had shut the door behind her, I opened, noiselessly so as not to appear anxious, the letter which ran as follows:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear, thank you for all the nice things that you say to me, I am at your orders to countermand the Rolls, if you think that I can help in any way, as I am sure I can. You have only to let me know the name of your agent. You would let yourself be taken in by these people whose only thought is of selling things, and what would you do with a motorcar, you who never stir out of the house? I am deeply touched that you have kept a happy memory of our last drive together. You may be sure that for my part I shall never forget that drive in a twofold twilight (since night was falling and we were about to part) and that it will be effaced from my memory only when the darkness is complete.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I felt that this final phrase was merely a phrase and that Albertine could not possibly retain until her death any such pleasant memory of this drive from which she had certainly derived no pleasure since she had been impatient to leave me. But I was impressed also, when I thought of the bicyclist, the golfer of Balbec, who had read nothing but Esther before she made my acquaintance, to find how richly endowed she was and how right I had been in thinking that she had in my house enriched herself with fresh qualities which made her different and more complete. And thus, the words that I had said to her at Balbec: \u201cI feel that my friendship would be of value to you, that I am just the person who could give you what you lack\u201d\u2014 I had written this upon a photograph which I gave her \u2014\u201cwith the certainty that I was being providential\u201d\u2014 these words, which I uttered without believing them and simply that she might find some advantage in my society which would outweigh any possible boredom, these words turned out to have been true as well. Similarly, for that matter, when I said to her that I did not wish to see her for fear of falling in love with her, I had said this because on the contrary I knew that in frequent intercourse my love grew cold and that separation kindled it, but in reality our frequent intercourse had given rise to a need of her that was infinitely stronger than my love in the first weeks at Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Albertine\u2019s letter did not help matters in any way. She spoke to me only of writing to my agent. It was necessary to escape from this situation, to cut matters short, and I had the following idea. I sent a letter at once to Andr\u00e9e in which I told her that Albertine was at her aunt\u2019s, that I felt very lonely, that she would be giving me an immense pleasure if she came and stayed with me for a few days and that, as I did not wish to make any mystery, I begged her to inform Albertine of this. And at the same time I wrote to Albertine as though I had not yet received her letter: \u201cMy dear, forgive me for doing something which you will understand so well, I have such a hatred of secrecy that I have chosen that you should be informed by her and by myself. I have acquired, from having you staying so charmingly in the house with me, the bad habit of not being able to live alone. Since we have decided that you are not to come back, it has occurred to me that the person who would best fill your place, because she would make least change in my life, would remind me most strongly of yourself, is Andr\u00e9e, and I have invited her here. So that all this may not appear too sudden, I have spoken to her only of a short visit, but between ourselves I am pretty certain that this time it will be permanent. Don\u2019t you agree that I am right? You know that your little group of girls at Balbec has always been the social unit that has exerted the greatest influence upon me, in which I have been most happy to be eventually included. No doubt it is this influence which still makes itself felt. Since the fatal incompatibility of our natures and the mischances of life have decreed that my little Albertine can never be my wife, I believe that I shall nevertheless find a wife \u2014 less charming than herself, but one whom greater conformities of nature will enable perhaps to be happier with me \u2014 in Andr\u00e9e.\u201d But after I had sent this letter to the post, the suspicion occurred to me suddenly that, when Albertine wrote to me: \u201cI should have been only too delighted to come back if you had written to me myself,\u201d she had said this only because I had not written to her, and that, had I done so, it would not have made any difference; that she would be glad to know that Andr\u00e9e was staying with me, to think of her as my wife, provided that she herself remained free, because she could now, as for a week past, stultifying the hourly precautions which I had adopted during more than six months in Paris, abandon herself to her vices and do what, minute by minute, I had prevented her from doing. I told myself that probably she was making an improper use, down there, of her freedom, and no doubt this idea which I formed seemed to me sad but remained general, shewing me no special details, and, by the indefinite number of possible mistresses which it allowed me to imagine, prevented me from stopping to consider any one of them, drew my mind on in a sort of perpetual motion not free from pain but tinged with a pain which the absence of any concrete image rendered endurable. It ceased however to be endurable and became atrocious when Saint-Loup arrived. Before I explain why the information that he gave me made me so unhappy, I ought to relate an incident which I place immediately before his visit and the memory of which so distressed me afterwards that it weakened, if not the painful impression that was made on me by my conversation with Saint-Loup, at any rate the practical effect of this conversation. This incident was as follows. Burning with impatience to see Saint-Loup, I was waiting for him upon the staircase (a thing which I could not have done had my mother been at home, for it was what she most abominated, next to \u2018talking from the window\u2019) when I heard the following speech: \u201cDo you mean to say you don\u2019t know how to get a fellow sacked whom you don\u2019t like? It\u2019s not difficult. You need only hide the things that he has to take in. Then, when they\u2019re in a hurry and ring for him, he can\u2019t find anything, he loses his head. My aunt will be furious with him, and will say to you: \u2018Why, what is the man doing?\u2019 When he does shew his face, everybody will be raging, and he won\u2019t have what is wanted. After this has happened four or five times, you may be sure that they\u2019ll sack him, especially if you take care to dirty the things that he has to bring in clean, and all that sort of thing.\u201d I remained speechless with astonishment, for these cruel, Machiavellian words were uttered by the voice of Saint-Loup. Now I had always regarded him as so good, so tender-hearted a person that this speech had the same effect upon me as if he had been acting the part of Satan in a play: it could not be in his own name that he was speaking. \u201cBut after all a man has got to earn his living,\u201d said the other person, of whom I then caught sight and who was one of the Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019s footmen. \u201cWhat the hell does that matter to you so long as you\u2019re all right?\u201d Saint-Loup replied callously. \u201cIt will be all the more fun for you, having a scape-goat. You can easily spill ink over his livery just when he has to go and wait at a big dinner-party, and never leave him in peace for a moment until he\u2019s only too glad to give notice. Anyhow, I can put a spoke in his wheel, I shall tell my aunt that I admire your patience in working with a great lout like that, and so dirty too.\u201d I shewed myself, Saint-Loup came to greet me, but my confidence in him was shaken since I had heard him speak in a manner so different from anything that I knew. And I asked myself whether a person who was capable of acting so cruelly towards a poor and defenceless man had not played the part of a traitor towards myself, on his mission to Mme. Bontemps. This reflexion was of most service in helping me not to regard his failure as a proof that I myself might not succeed, after he had left me. But so long as he was with me, it was nevertheless of the Saint-Loup of long ago and especially of the friend who had just come from Mme. Bontemps that I thought. He began by saying: \u201cYou feel that I ought to have telephoned to you more often, but I was always told that you were engaged.\u201d But the point at which my pain became unendurable was when he said: \u201cTo begin where my last telegram left you, after passing by a sort of shed, I entered the house and at the end of a long passage was shewn into a drawing-room.\u201d At these words, shed, passage, drawing-room, and before he had even finished uttering them, my heart was shattered more swiftly than by an electric current, for the force which girdles the earth many times in a second is not electricity, but pain. How I repeated them to myself, renewing the shock as I chose, these words, shed, passage, drawing-room, after Saint-Loup had left me! In a shed one girl can lie down with another. And in that drawing-room who could tell what Albertine used to do when her aunt was not there? What was this? Had I then imagined the house in which she was living as incapable of possessing either a shed or a drawing-room? No, I had not imagined it at all, except as a vague place. I had suffered originally at the geographical identification of the place in which Albertine was. When I had learned that, instead of being in two or three possible places, she was in Touraine, those words uttered by her porter had marked in my heart as upon a map the place in which I must at length suffer. But once I had grown accustomed to the idea that she was in a house in Touraine, I had not seen the house. Never had there occurred to my imagination this appalling idea of a drawing-room, a shed, a passage, which seemed to be facing me in the retina of Saint-Loup\u2019s eyes, who had seen them, these rooms in which Albertine came and went, was living her life, these rooms in particular and not an infinity of possible rooms which had cancelled one another. With the words shed, passage, drawing-room, I became aware of my folly in having left Albertine for a week in this cursed place, the existence (instead of the mere possibility) of which had just been revealed to me. Alas! when Saint-Loup told me also that in this drawing-room he had heard some one singing at the top of her voice in an adjoining room and that it was Albertine who was singing, I realised with despair that, rid of me at last, she was happy! She had regained her freedom. And I who had been thinking that she would come to take the place of Andr\u00e9e! My grief turned to anger with Saint-Loup. \u201cThat is the one thing in the world that I asked you to avoid, that she should know of your coming.\u201d \u201cIf you imagine it was easy! They had assured me that she was not in the house. Oh, I know very well that you aren\u2019t pleased with me, I could tell that from your telegrams. But you are not being fair to me, I did all that I could.\u201d Set free once more, having left the cage from which, here at home, I used to remain for days on end without making her come to my room, Albertine had regained all her value in my eyes, she had become once more the person whom everyone pursued, the marvellous bird of the earliest days. \u201cHowever, let us get back to business. As for the question of the money, I don\u2019t know what to say to you, I found myself addressing a woman who seemed to me to be so scrupulous that I was afraid of shocking her. However, she didn\u2019t say no when I mentioned the money to her. In fact, a little later she told me that she was touched to find that we understood one another so well. And yet everything that she said after that was so delicate, so refined, that it seemed to me impossible that she could have been referring to my offer of money when she said: \u2018We understand one another so well,\u2019 for after all I was behaving like a cad.\u201d \u201cBut perhaps she did not realise what you meant, she cannot have heard you, you ought to have repeated the offer, for then you would certainly have won the battle.\u201d \u201cBut what do you mean by saying that she cannot have heard me, I spoke to her as I am speaking to you, she is neither deaf nor mad.\u201d \u201cAnd she made no comment?\u201d \u201cNone.\u201d \u201cYou ought to have repeated the offer.\u201d \u201cHow do you mean, repeat it? As soon as we met I saw what sort of person she was, I said to myself that you had made a mistake, that you were letting me in for the most awful blunder, and that it would be terribly difficult to offer her the money like that. I did it, however, to oblige you, feeling certain that she would turn me out of the house.\u201d \u201cBut she did not. Therefore, either she had not heard you and you should have started afresh, or you could have developed the topic.\u201d \u201cYou say: \u2018She had not heard,\u2019 because you were here in Paris, but, I repeat, if you had been present at our conversation, there was not a sound to interrupt us, I said it quite bluntly, it is not possible that she failed to understand.\u201d \u201cBut anyhow is she quite convinced that I have always wished to marry her niece?\u201d \u201cNo, as to that, if you want my opinion, she did not believe that you had any Intention of marrying the girl. She told me that you yourself had informed her niece that you wished to leave her. I don\u2019t really know whether now she is convinced that you wish to marry.\u201d This reassured me slightly by shewing me that I was less humiliated, and therefore more capable of being still loved, more free to take some decisive action. Nevertheless I was in torments. \u201cI am sorry, because I can see that you are not pleased.\u201d \u201cYes, I am touched by your kindness, I am grateful to you, but it seems to me that you might. . . . \u201d \u201cI did my best. No one else could have done more or even as much. Try sending some one else.\u201d \u201cNo, as a matter of fact, if I had known, I should not have sent you, but the failure of your attempt prevents me from making another.\u201d I heaped reproaches upon him: he had tried to do me a service and had not succeeded. Saint-Loup as he left the house had met some girls coming in. I had already and often supposed that Albertine knew other girls in the country; but this was the first time that I felt the torture of that supposition. We are really led to believe that nature has allowed our mind to secrete a natural antidote which destroys the suppositions that we form, at once without intermission and without danger. But there was nothing to render me immune from these girls whom Saint-Loup had met. All these details, were they not precisely what I had sought to learn from everyone with regard to Albertine, was it not I who, in order to learn them more fully, had begged Saint-Loup, summoned back to Paris by his colonel, to come and see me at all costs, was it not therefore I who had desired them, or rather my famished grief, longing to feed and to wax fat upon them? Finally Saint-Loup told me that he had had the pleasant surprise of meeting, quite near the house, the only familiar face that had reminded him of the past, a former friend of Rachel, a pretty actress who was taking a holiday in the neighbourhood. And the name of this actress was enough to make me say to myself: \u201cPerhaps it is with her\u201d; was enough to make me behold, in the arms even of a woman whom I did not know, Albertine smiling and flushed with pleasure. And after all why should not this have been true? Had I found fault with myself for thinking of other women since I had known Albertine? On the evening of my first visit to the Princesse de Guermantes, when I returned home, had I not been thinking far less of her than of the girl of whom Saint-Loup had told me who frequented disorderly houses and of Mme. Putbus\u2019s maid? Was it not in the hope of meeting the latter of these that I had returned to Balbec, and, more recently, had been planning to go to Venice? Why should not Albertine have been planning to go to Touraine? Only, when it came to the point, as I now realised, I would not have left her, I would not have gone to Venice. Even in my own heart of hearts, when I said to myself: \u201cI shall leave her presently,\u201d I knew that I would never leave her, just as I knew that I would never settle down again to work, or make myself live upon hygienic principles, or do any of the things which, day by day, I vowed that I would do upon the morrow. Only, whatever I might feel in my heart, I had thought it more adroit to let her live under the perpetual menace of a separation. And no doubt, thanks to my detestable adroitness, I had convinced her only too well. In any case, now, things could not go on like this. I could not leave her in Touraine with those girls, with that actress, I could not endure the thought of that life which was escaping my control. I would await her reply to my letter: if she was doing wrong, alas! a day more or less made no difference (and perhaps I said this to myself because, being no longer in the habit of taking note of every minute of her life, whereas a single minute in which she was unobserved would formerly have driven me out of my mind, my jealousy no longer observed the same division of time). But as soon as I should have received her answer, if she was not coming back, I would go to fetch her; willy-nilly, I would tear her away from her women friends. Besides, was it not better for me to go down in person, now that I had discovered the duplicity, hitherto unsuspected by me, of Saint-Loup; he might, for all I knew, have organised a plot to separate me from Albertine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And at the same time, how I should have been lying now had I written to her, as I used to say to her in Paris, that I hoped that no accident might befall her. Ah! if some accident had occurred, my life, instead of being poisoned for ever by this incessant jealousy, would at once regain, if not happiness, at least a state of calm through the suppression of suffering\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The suppression of suffering? Can I really have believed it, have believed that death merely eliminates what exists, and leaves everything else in its place, that it removes the grief from the heart of him for whom the other person\u2019s existence has ceased to be anything but a source of grief, that it removes the grief and substitutes nothing in its place. The suppression of grief! As I glanced at the paragraphs in the newspapers, I regretted that I had not had the courage to form the same wish as Swann. If Albertine could have been the victim of an accident, were she alive I should have had a pretext for hastening to her bedside, were she dead I should have recovered, as Swann said, my freedom to live as I chose. Did I believe this? He had believed it, that subtlest of men who thought that he knew himself well. How little do we know what we have in our heart. How clearly, a little later, had he been still alive, I could have proved to him that his wish was not only criminal but absurd, that the death of her whom he loved would have set him free from nothing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I forsook all pride with regard to Albertine, I sent her a despairing telegram begging her to return upon any conditions, telling her that she might do anything she liked, that I asked only to be allowed to take her in my arms for a minute three times a week, before she went to bed. And had she confined me to once a week, I would have accepted the restriction. She did not, ever, return. My telegram had just gone to her when I myself received one. It was from Mme. Bontemps. The world is not created once and for all time for each of us individually. There are added to it in the course of our life things of which we have never had any suspicion. Alas! it was not a suppression of suffering that was wrought in me by the first two lines of the telegram: \u201cMy poor friend, our little Albertine is no more; forgive me for breaking this terrible news to you who were so fond of her. She was thrown by her horse against a tree while she was out riding. All our efforts to restore her to life were unavailing. If only I were dead in her place!\u201d No, not the suppression of suffering, but a suffering until then unimagined, that of learning that she would not come back. And yet, had I not told myself, many times, that, quite possibly, she would not come back? I had indeed told myself so, but now I saw that never for a moment had I believed it. As I needed her presence, her kisses, to enable me to endure the pain that my suspicions wrought in me, I had formed, since our Balbec days, the habit of being always with her. Even when she had gone out, when I was left alone, I was kissing her still. I had continued to do so since her departure for Touraine. I had less need of her fidelity than of her return. And if my reason might with impunity cast a doubt upon her now and again, my imagination never ceased for an instant to bring her before me. Instinctively I passed my hand over my throat, over my lips which felt themselves kissed by her lips still after she had gone away, and would never be kissed by them again; I passed my hands over them, as Mamma had caressed me at the time of grandmother\u2019s death, when she said: \u201cMy poor boy, your grandmother, who was so fond of you, will never kiss you again.\u201d All my life to come seemed to have been wrenched from my heart. My life to come? I had not then thought at times of living it without Albertine? Why, no! All this time had I, then, been vowing to her service every minute of my life until my death? Why, of course! This future indissolubly blended with hers I had never had the vision to perceive, but now that it had just been shattered, I could feel the place that it occupied in my gaping heart. Fran\u00e7oise, who still knew nothing, came into my room; in a sudden fury I shouted at her: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Then (there are sometimes words which set a different reality in the same place as that which confronts us; they stun us as does a sudden fit of giddiness) she said to me: \u201cMonsieur has no need to look cross. I\u2019ve got something here that will make him very happy. Here are two letters from Mademoiselle Albertine.\u201d I felt, afterwards, that I must have stared at her with the eyes of a man whose mind has become unbalanced. I was not even glad, nor was I incredulous. I was like a person who sees the same place in his room occupied by a sofa and by a grotto: nothing seeming to him more real, he collapses on the floor. Albertine\u2019s two letters must have been written at an interval of a few hours, possibly at the same moment, and, anyhow, only a short while before the fatal ride. The first said: \u201cMy dear, I must thank you for the proof of your confidence which you give me when you tell me of your plan to get Andr\u00e9e to stay with you. I am sure that she will be delighted to accept, and I think that it will be a very good thing for her. With her talents, she will know how to make the most of the companionship of a man like yourself, and of the admirable influence which you manage to secure over other people. I feel that you have had an idea from which as much good may spring for her as for yourself. And so, if she should make the least shadow of difficulty (which I don\u2019t suppose), telegraph to me, I undertake to bring pressure to bear upon her.\u201d The second was dated on the following day. (As a matter of fact, she must have written her two letters at an interval of a few minutes, possibly without any interval, and must have antedated the first. For, all the time, I had been forming an absurd idea of her intentions, which had been only this: to return to me, and which anyone with no direct interest in the matter, a man lacking in imagination, the plenipotentiary in a peace treaty, the merchant who has to examine a deal, would have judged more accurately than myself.) It contained only these words: \u201cIs it too late for me to return to you? If you have not yet written to Andr\u00e9e, would you be prepared to take me back? I shall abide by your decision, but I beg you not to be long in letting me know it, you can imagine how impatiently I shall be waiting. If it is telling me to return, I shall take the train at once. With my whole heart, yours, Albertine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the death of Albertine to be able to suppress my suffering, the shock of the fall would have had to kill her not only in Touraine but in myself. There, never had she been more alive. In order to enter into us, another person must first have assumed the form, have entered into the surroundings of the moment; appearing to us only in a succession of momentary flashes, he has never been able to furnish us with more than one aspect of himself at a time, to present us with more than a single photograph of himself. A great weakness, no doubt, for a person to consist merely in a collection of moments; a great strength also: it is dependent upon memory, and our memory of a moment is not informed of everything that has happened since; this moment which it has registered endures still, lives still, and with it the person whose form is outlined in it. And moreover, this disintegration does not only make the dead man live, it multiplies him. To find consolation, it was not one, it was innumerable Albertines that I must first forget. When I had reached the stage of enduring the grief of losing this Albertine, I must begin afresh with another, with a hundred others\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, then, my life was entirely altered. What had made it \u2014 and not owing to Albertine, concurrently with her, when I was alone \u2014 attractive, was precisely the perpetual resurgence, at the bidding of identical moments, of moments from the past. From the sound of the rain I recaptured the scent of the lilacs at Combray, from the shifting of the sun\u2019s rays on the balcony the pigeons in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, from the muffling of all noise in the heat of the morning hours, the cool taste of cherries, the longing for Brittany or Venice from the sound of the wind and the return of Easter. Summer was at hand, the days were long, the weather warm. It was the season when, early in the morning, pupils and teachers resort to the public gardens to prepare for the final examinations under the trees, seeking to extract the sole drop of coolness that is let fall by a sky less ardent than in the midday heat but already as sterilely pure. From my darkened room, with a power of evocation equal to that of former days but capable now of evoking only pain, I felt that outside, in the heaviness of the atmosphere, the setting sun was plastering the vertical fronts of houses and churches with a tawny distemper. And if Fran\u00e7oise, when she came in, parted, by accident, the inner curtains, I stifled a cry of pain at the gash that was cut in my heart by that ray of long-ago sunlight which had made beautiful in my eyes the modern front of Marcouville l\u2019Orgueilleuse, when Albertine said to me: \u201cIt is restored.\u201d Not knowing how to account to Fran\u00e7oise for my groan, I said to her: \u201cOh, I am so thirsty.\u201d She left the room, returned, but I turned sharply away, smarting under the painful discharge of one of the thousand invisible memories which at every moment burst into view in the surrounding darkness: I had noticed that she had brought in a jug of cider and a dish of cherries, things which a farm-lad had brought out to us in the carriage, at Balbec, \u2018kinds\u2019 in which I should have made the most perfect communion, in those days, with the prismatic gleam in shuttered dining-rooms on days of scorching heat. Then I thought for the first time of the farm called Les Ecorres, and said to myself that on certain days when Albertine had told me, at Balbec, that she would not be free, that she was obliged to go somewhere with her aunt, she had perhaps been with one or another of her girl friends at some farm to which she knew that I was not in the habit of going, and, while I waited desperately for her at Marie-Antoinette, where they told me: \u201cNo, we have not seen her to-day,\u201d had been using, to her friend, the same words that she used to say to myself when we went out together: \u201cHe will never think of looking for us here, so that there\u2019s no fear of our being disturbed.\u201d I told Fran\u00e7oise to draw the curtains together, so that I should not see that ray of sunlight. But it continued to filter through, just as corrosive, into my memory. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appeal to me, it has been restored, but we shall go to-morrow to Saint-Mars le V\u00eatu, and the day after to . . . \u201d To-morrow, the day after, it was a prospect of life shared in common, perhaps for all time, that was opening; my heart leaped towards it, but it was no longer there, Albertine was dead\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I asked Fran\u00e7oise the time. Six o\u2019clock. At last, thank God, that oppressive heat would be lifted of which in the past I used to complain to Albertine, and which we so enjoyed. The day was drawing to its close. But what did that profit me? The cool evening air came in; it was the sun setting in my memory, at the end of a road which we had taken, she and I, on our way home, that I saw now, more remote than the farthest village, like some distant town not to be reached that evening, which we would spend at Balbec, still together. Together then; now I must stop short on the brink of that same abyss; she was dead. It was not enough now to draw the curtains, I tried to stop the eyes and ears of my memory so as not to see that band of orange in the western sky, so as not to hear those invisible birds responding from one tree to the next on either side of me who was then so tenderly embraced by her that now was dead. I tried to avoid those sensations that are given us by the dampness of leaves in the evening air, the steep rise and fall of mule-tracks. But already those sensations had gripped me afresh, carried far enough back from the present moment so that it should have gathered all the recoil, all the resilience necessary to strike me afresh, this idea that Albertine was dead. Ah! never again would I enter a forest, I would stroll no more beneath the spreading trees. But would the broad plains be less cruel to me? How many times had I crossed, going in search of Albertine, how many times had I entered, on my return with her, the great plain of Cricqueville, now in foggy weather when the flooding mist gave us the illusion of being surrounded by a vast lake, now on limpid evenings when the moonlight, de-materialising the earth, making it appear, a yard away, celestial, as it is, in the daytime, on far horizons only, enshrined the fields, the woods, with the firmament to which it had assimilated them, in the moss-agate of a universal blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fran\u00e7oise was bound to rejoice at Albertine\u2019s death, and it should, in justice to her, be said that by a sort of tactful convention she made no pretence of sorrow. But the unwritten laws of her immemorial code and the tradition of the mediaeval peasant woman who weeps as in the romances of chivalry were older than her hatred of Albertine and even of Eulalie. And so, on one of these late afternoons, as I was not quick enough in concealing my distress, she caught sight of my tears, served by the instinct of a little old peasant woman which at one time had led her to catch and torture animals, to feel only amusement in wringing the necks of chickens and in boiling lobsters alive, and, when I was ill, in observing, as it might be the wounds that she had inflicted upon an owl, my suffering expression which she afterwards proclaimed in a sepulchral tone and as a presage of coming disaster. But her Combray \u2018Customary\u2019 did not permit her to treat lightly tears, grief, things which in her judgment were as fatal as shedding one\u2019s flannels in spring or eating when one had no \u2018stomach.\u2019 \u201cOh, no. Monsieur, it doesn\u2019t do to cry like that, it isn\u2019t good for you.\u201d And in her attempt to stem my tears she shewed as much uneasiness as though they had been torrents of blood. Unfortunately I adopted a chilly air that cut short the effusions in which she was hoping to indulge and which might quite well, for that matter, have been sincere. Her attitude towards Albertine had been, perhaps, akin to her attitude towards Eulalie, and, now that my mistress could no longer derive any profit from me, Fran\u00e7oise had ceased to hate her. She felt bound, however, to let me see that she was perfectly well aware that I was crying, and that, following the deplorable example set by my family, I did not wish to \u2018let it be seen.\u2019 \u201cYou mustn\u2019t cry, Monsieur,\u201d she adjured me, in a calmer tone, this time, and intending to prove her own perspicacity rather than to shew me any compassion. And she went on: \u201cIt was bound to happen; she was too happy, poor creature, she never knew how happy she was.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How slow the day is in dying on these interminable summer evenings. A pallid ghost of the house opposite continued indefinitely to sketch upon the sky its persistent whiteness. At last it was dark indoors; I stumbled against the furniture in the hall, but in the door that opened upon the staircase, in the midst of the darkness which I had supposed to be complete, the glazed panel was translucent and blue, with the blue of a flower, the blue of an insect\u2019s wing, a blue that would have seemed to me beautiful if I had not felt it to be a last reflexion, trenchant as a blade of steel, a supreme blow which in its indefatigable cruelty the day was still dealing me. In the end, however, the darkness became complete, but then a glimpse of a star behind one of the trees in the courtyard was enough to remind me of how we used to set out in a carriage, after dinner, for the woods of Chantepie, carpeted with moonlight. And even in the streets it would so happen that I could isolate upon the back of a seat, could gather there the natural purity of a moonbeam in the midst of the artificial lights of Paris, of that Paris over which it enthroned, by making the town return for a moment, in my imagination, to a state of nature, with the infinite silence of the suggested fields, the heartrending memory of the walks that I had taken in them with Albertine. Ah! when would the night end? But at the first cool breath of dawn I shuddered, for it had revived in me the delight of that summer when, from Balbec to Incarville, from Incarville to Balbec, we had so many times escorted each other home until the break of day. I had now only one hope left for the future \u2014 a hope far more heartrending than any dread \u2014 which was that I might forget Albertine. I knew that I should one day forget her; I had quite forgotten Gilberte, Mme. de Guermantes; I had quite forgotten my grandmother. And it is our most fitting and most cruel punishment, for that so complete oblivion, as tranquil as the oblivion of the graveyard, by which we have detached ourself from those whom we no longer love, that we can see this same oblivion to be inevitable in the case of those whom we love still. To tell the truth, we know it to be a state not painful, a state of indifference. But not being able to think at the same time of what I was and of what I should one day be, I thought with despair of all that covering mantle of caresses, of kisses, of friendly slumber, of which I must presently let myself be divested for all time. The rush of these tender memories sweeping on to break against the knowledge that Albertine was dead oppressed me by the incessant conflict of their baffled waves so that I could not keep still; I rose, but all of a sudden I stopped in consternation; the same faint daybreak that I used to see at the moment when I had just left Albertine, still radiant and warm with her kisses, had come into the room and bared, above the curtains, its blade now a sinister portent, whose whiteness, cold, implacable and compact, entered the room like a dagger thrust into my heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Presently the sounds from the streets would begin, enabling me to tell from the qualitative scale of their resonance the degree of the steadily increasing heat in which they were sounding. But in this heat which, a few hours later, would have saturated itself in the fragrance of cherries, what I found (as in a medicine which the substitution of one ingredient for another is sufficient to transform from the stimulant and tonic that it was into a debilitating drug) was no longer the desire for women but the anguish of Albertine\u2019s departure. Besides, the memory of all my desires was as much impregnated with her, and with suffering, as the memory of my pleasures. That Venice where I had thought that her company would be a nuisance (doubtless because I had felt in a confused way that it would be necessary to me), now that Albertine was no more, I preferred not to go there. Albertine had seemed to me to be an obstacle interposed between me and everything else, because she was for me what contained everything, and it was from her as from an urn that I might receive things. Now that this urn was shattered, I no longer felt that I had the courage to grasp things; there was nothing now from which I did not turn away, spiritless, preferring not to taste it. So that my separation from her did not in the least throw open to me the field of possible pleasures which I had imagined to be closed to me by her presence. Besides, the obstacle which her Presence had perhaps indeed been in the way of my traveling, of my enjoying life, had only (as always happens) been a mask for other obstacles which reappeared intact now that this first obstacle had been removed. It had been in the same way that, in the past, when some friend had called to see me and had prevented me from working, if on the following day I was left undisturbed, I did not work any better. Let an illness, a duel, a runaway horse make us see death face to face, how richly we should have enjoyed the life of pleasure, the travels in unknown lands which are about to be snatched from us. And no sooner is the danger past than what we find once again before us is the same dull life in which none of those delights had any existence for us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No doubt these nights that are so short continue for but a brief season. Winter would at length return, when I should no longer have to dread the memory of drives with her, protracted until the too early dawn. But would not the first frosts bring back to me, preserved in their cold storage, the germ of my first desires, when at midnight I used to send for her, when the time seemed so long until I heard her ring the bell: a sound for which I might now wait everlastingly in vain? Would they not bring back to me the germ of my first uneasiness, when, upon two occasions, I thought that she was not coming? At that time I saw her but rarely, but even those intervals that there were between her visits which made her emerge, after many weeks, from the heart of an unknown life which I made no effort to possess, ensured my peace of mind by preventing the first inklings, constantly interrupted, of my jealousy from coagulating, from forming a solid mass in my heart. So far as they had contrived to be soothing, at that earlier time, so far, in retrospect, were they stamped with the mark of suffering, since all the unaccountable things that she might, while those intervals lasted, have been doing had ceased to be immaterial to me, and especially now that no visit from her would ever fall to my lot again; so that those January evenings on which she used to come, and which, for that reason, had been so dear to me, would blow into me now with their biting winds an uneasiness which then I did not know, and would bring back to me (but now grown pernicious) the first germ of my love. And when I considered that I would see again presently that cold season, which since the time of Gilberte and my play-hours in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, had always seemed to me so depressing; when I thought that there would be returning again evenings like that evening of snow when I had vainly, far into the night, waited for Albertine to come; then as a consumptive chooses the best place, from the physical point of view, for his lungs, but in my case making a moral choice, what at such moments I still dreaded most for my grief, for my heart, was the return of the intense cold, and I said to myself that what it would be hardest to live through was perhaps the winter. Bound up as it was with each of the seasons, in order for me to discard the memory of Albertine I should have had first to forget them all, prepared to begin again to learn to know them, as an old man after a stroke of paralysis learns again to read; I should have had first to forego the entire universe. Nothing, I told myself, but an actual extinction of myself would be capable (but that was impossible) of consoling me for hers. I did not realise that the death of oneself is neither impossible nor extraordinary; it is effected without our knowledge, it may be against our will, every day of our life, and I should have to suffer from the recurrence of all sorts of days which not only nature but adventitious circumstances, a purely conventional order introduce into a season. Presently would return the day on which I had gone to Balbec in that earlier summer when my love, which was not yet inseparable from jealousy and did not perplex itself with the problem of what Albertine would be doing all day, had still to pass through so many evolutions before becoming that so specialised love of the latest period, that this final year, in which Albertine\u2019s destiny had begun to change and had received its quietus, appeared to me full, multiform, vast, like a whole century. Then it would be the memory of days more slow in reviving but dating from still earlier years; on the rainy Sundays on which nevertheless everyone else had gone out, in the void of the afternoon, when the sound of wind and rain would in the past have bidden me stay at home, to \u2018philosophise in my garret,\u2019 with what anxiety would I see the hour approach at which Albertine, so little expected, had come to visit me, had fondled me for the first time, breaking off because Fran\u00e7oise had brought in the lamp, in that time now doubly dead when it had been Albertine who was interested in me, when my affection for her might legitimately nourish so strong a hope. Even later in the season, those glorious evenings when the windows of kitchens, of girls\u2019 schools, standing open to the view like wayside shrines, allow the street to crown itself with a diadem of those demi-goddesses who, conversing, ever so close to us, with their peers, fill us with a feverish longing to penetrate into their mythological existence, recalled to me nothing now but the affection of Albertine whose company was an obstacle in the way of my approaching them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, to the memory even of hours that were purely natural would inevitably be added the moral background that makes each of them a thing apart. When, later on, I should hear the goatherd\u2019s horn, on a first fine, almost Italian morning, the day that followed would blend successively with its sunshine the anxiety of knowing that Albertine was at the Trocad\u00e9ro, possibly with L\u00e9a and the two girls, then her kindly, domestic gentleness, almost that of a wife who seemed to me then an embarrassment and whom Fran\u00e7oise was bringing home to me. That telephone message from Fran\u00e7oise which had conveyed to me the dutiful homage of an Albertine who was returning with her, I had thought at the time that it made me swell with pride. I was mistaken. If it had exhilarated me, that was because it had made me feel that she whom I loved was really mine, lived only for me, and even at a distance, without my needing to occupy my mind with her, regarded me as her lord and master, returning home upon a sign from myself. And so that telephone message had been a particle of sweetness, coming to me from afar, sent out from that region of the Trocad\u00e9ro where there were proved to be for me sources of happiness directing towards me molecules of comfort, healing balms, restoring to me at length so precious a liberty of spirit that I need do no more, surrendering myself without the restriction of a single care to Wagner\u2019s music, than await the certain arrival of Albertine, without fever, with an entire absence of impatience in which I had not had the perspicacity to recognise true happiness. And this happiness that she should return, that she should obey me and be mine, the cause of it lay in love and not in pride. It would have been quite immaterial to me now to have at my behest fifty women returning, at a sign from myself, not from the Trocad\u00e9ro but from the Indies. But that day, conscious of Albertine who, while I sat alone in my room playing music, was coming dutifully to join me, I had breathed in, where it lay scattered like motes in a sunbeam, one of those substances which, just as others are salutary to the body, do good to the soul. Then there had been, half an hour later, Albertine\u2019s return, then the drive with Albertine returned, a drive which I had thought tedious because it was accompanied for me by certainty, but which, on account of that very certainty, had, from the moment of Francoise\u2019s telephoning to me that she was bringing Albertine home, let flow a golden calm over the hours that followed, had made of them as it were a second day, wholly unlike the first, because it had a completely different moral basis, a moral basis which made it an original day, which came and added itself to the variety of the days that I had previously known, a day which I should never have been able to imagine \u2014 any more than we could imagine the delicious idleness of a day in summer if such days did not exist in the calendar of those through which we had lived \u2014 a day of which I could not say absolutely that I recalled it, for to this calm I added now an anguish which I had not felt at the time. But at a much later date, when I went over gradually, in a reversed order, the times through which I had passed before I was so much in love with Albertine, when my scarred heart could detach itself without suffering from Albertine dead, then I was able to recall at length without suffering that day on which Albertine had gone shopping with Fran\u00e7oise instead of remaining at the Trocad\u00e9ro; I recalled it with pleasure, as belonging to a moral season which I had not known until then; I recalled it at length exactly, without adding to it now any suffering, rather, on the contrary, as we recall certain days in summer which we found too hot while they lasted, and from which only after they have passed do we extract their unalloyed standard of fine gold and imperishable azure\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the result that these several years imposed upon my memory of Albertine, which made them so painful, the successive colouring, the different modulations not only of their seasons or of their hours, from late afternoons in June to winter evenings, from seas by moonlight to dawn that broke as I was on my way home, from snow in Paris to fallen leaves at Saint-Cloud, but also of each of the particular ideas of Albertine that I successively formed, of the physical aspect in which I pictured her at each of those moments, the degree of frequency with which I had seen her during that season, which itself appeared consequently more or less dispersed or compact, the anxieties which she might have caused me by keeping me waiting, the desire which I had felt at a given moment for her, the hopes formed and then blasted; all of these modified the character of my retrospective sorrow fully as much as the impressions of light or of scents which were associated with it, and completed each of the solar years through which I had lived \u2014 years which, simply with their springs, their trees, their breezes, were already so sad because of the indissociable memory of her \u2014 complementing each of them with a sort of sentimental year in which the hours were defined not by the sun\u2019s position, but by the strain of waiting for a tryst, in which the length of the days, in which the changes of temperature were determined not by the seasons but by the soaring flight of my hopes, the progress of our intimacy, the gradual transformation of her face, the expeditions on which she had gone, the frequency and style of the letters that she had written me during her absence, her more or less eager anxiety to see me on her return. And lastly if these changes of season, if these different days furnished me each with a fresh Albertine, it was not only by recalling to me similar moments. The reader will remember that always, even before I began to be in love, each day had made me a different person, swayed by other desires because he had other perceptions, a person who, whereas he had dreamed only of cliffs and tempests overnight, if the indiscreet spring dawn had distilled a scent of roses through the gaping portals of his house of sleep, would awake alert to set off for Italy. Even in my love, had not the changing state of my moral atmosphere, the varying pressure of my beliefs, had they not one day diminished the visibility of the love that I was feeling, had they not another day extended it beyond all bounds, one day softened it to a smile, another day condensed it to a storm? We exist only by virtue of what we possess, we possess only what is really present to us, and so many of our memories, our humours, our ideas set out to voyage far away from us, until they are lost to sight! Then we can no longer make them enter into our reckoning of the total which is our personality. But they know of secret paths by which to return to us. And on certain nights, having gone to sleep almost without regretting Albertine any more \u2014 we can regret only what we remember \u2014 on awakening I found a whole fleet of memories which had come to cruise upon the surface of my clearest consciousness, and seemed marvellously distinct. Then I wept over what I could see so plainly, what overnight had been to me non-existent. In an instant, Albertine\u2019s name, her death, had changed their meaning; her betrayals had suddenly resumed their old importance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How could she have seemed dead to me when now, in order to think of her, I had at my disposal only those same images one or other of which I used to recall when she was alive, each one being associated with a particular moment? Rapid and bowed above the mystic wheel of her bicycle, tightly strapped upon rainy days in the amazonian corslet of her waterproof which made her breasts protrude, while serpents writhed in her turbaned hair, she scattered terror in the streets of Balbec; on the evenings on which we had taken champagne with us to the woods of Chantepie, her voice provoking, altered, she shewed on her face that pallid warmth colouring only over her cheekbones so that, barely able to make her out in the darkness of the carriage, I drew her face into the moonlight in order to see her better, and which I tried now in vain to recapture, to see again in a darkness that would never end. A little statuette as we drove to the island, a large, calm, coarsely grained face above the pianola, she was thus by turns rain-soaked and swift, provoking and diaphanous, motionless and smiling, an angel of music. So that what would have to be obliterated in me was not one only, but countless Albertines. Each of these was thus attached to a moment, to the date of which I found myself carried back when I saw again that particular Albertine. And the moments of the past do not remain still; they retain in our memory the motion which drew them towards the future, towards a future which has itself become the past, and draw us on in their train. Never had I caressed the waterproofed Albertine of the rainy days, I wanted to ask her to divest herself of that armour, that would be to know with her the love of the tented field, the brotherhood of travel. But this was no longer possible, she was dead. Never either, for fear of corrupting her, had I shewn any sign of comprehension on the evenings when she seemed to be offering me pleasures which, but for my self-restraint, she would not perhaps have sought from others, and which aroused in me now a frantic desire. I should not have found them the same in any other woman, but she who would fain have offered me them I might scour the whole world now without encountering, for Albertine was dead. It seemed that I had to choose between two sets of facts, to decide which was the truth, so far was the fact of Albertine\u2019s death \u2014 arising for me from a reality which I had not known; her life in Touraine \u2014 a contradiction of all my thoughts of her, my desires, my regrets, my tenderness, my rage, my jealousy. So great a wealth of memories, borrowed from the treasury of her life, such a profusion of sentiments evoking, implicating her life, seemed to make it incredible that Albertine should be dead. Such a profusion of sentiments, for my memory, while preserving my affection, left to it all its variety. It was not Albertine alone that was simply a series of moments, it was also myself. My love for her had not been simple: to a curious interest in the unknown had been added a sensual desire and to a sentiment of an almost conjugal mildness, at one moment indifference, at another a jealous fury. I was not one man only, but the steady advance hour after hour of an army in close formation, in which there appeared, according to the moment, impassioned men, indifferent men, jealous men \u2014 jealous men no two of whom were jealous of the same woman. And no doubt it would be from this that one day would come the healing which I should not expect. In a composite mass, these elements may, one by one, without our noticing it, be replaced by others, which others again eliminate or reinforce, until in the end a change has been brought about which it would be impossible to conceive if we were a single person. The complexity of my love, of my person, multiplied, diversified my sufferings. And yet they could always be ranged in the two categories, the option between which had made up the whole life of my love for Albertine, swayed alternately by trust and by a jealous suspicion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If I had found it difficult to imagine that Albertine, so vitally alive in me (wearing as I did the double harness of the present and the past), was dead, perhaps it was equally paradoxical in me that Albertine, whom I knew to be dead, could still excite my jealousy, and that this suspicion of the misdeeds of which Albertine, stripped now of the flesh that had rejoiced in them, of the heart that had been able to desire them, was no longer capable, nor responsible for them, should excite in me so keen a suffering that I should only have blessed them could I have seen in those misdeeds the pledge of the moral reality of a person materially non-existent, in place of the reflexion, destined itself too to fade, of impressions that she had made on me in the past. A woman who could no longer taste any pleasure with other people ought not any longer to have excited my jealousy, if only my affection had been able to come to the surface. But this was just what was impossible, since it could not find its object, Albertine, save among memories in which she was still alive. Since, merely by thinking of her, I brought her back to life, her infidelities could never be those of a dead woman; the moments at which she had been guilty of them became the present moment, not only for Albertine, but for that one of my various selves who was thinking of her. So that no anachronism could ever separate the indissoluble couple, in which, to each fresh culprit, was immediately mated a jealous lover, pitiable and always contemporaneous. I had, during the last months, kept her shut up in my own house. But in my imagination now, Albertine was free, she was abusing her freedom, was prostituting herself to this friend or to that. Formerly, I used constantly to dream of the uncertain future that was unfolding itself before us, I endeavoured to read its message. And now, what lay before me, like a counterpart of the future \u2014 as absorbing as the future because it was equally uncertain, as difficult to decipher, as mysterious, more cruel still because I had not, as with the future, the possibility or the illusion of influencing it, and also because it unrolled itself to the full extent of my own life without my companion\u2019s being present to soothe the anguish that it caused me \u2014 was no longer Albertine\u2019s Future, it was her Past. Her Past? That is the wrong word, since for jealousy there can be neither past nor future, and what it imagines is invariably the present\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Atmospheric changes, provoking other changes in the inner man, awaken forgotten variants of himself, upset the somnolent course of habit, restore their old force to certain memories, to certain sufferings. How much the more so with me if this change of weather recalled to me the weather in which Albertine, at Balbec, under the threat of rain, it might be, used to set out, heaven knows why, upon long rides, in the clinging mail-armour of her waterproof. If she had lived, no doubt to-day, in this so similar weather, she would be setting out, in Touraine, upon a corresponding expedition. Since she could do so no longer, I ought not to have been pained by the thought; but, as with amputated cripples, the slightest change in the weather revived my pains in the member that had ceased, now, to belong to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All of a sudden it was an impression which I had not felt for a long time \u2014 for it had remained dissolved in the fluid and invisible expanse of my memory \u2014 that became crystallised. Many years ago, when somebody mentioned her bath-wrap, Albertine had blushed. At that time I was not jealous of her. But since then I had intended to ask her if she could remember that conversation, and why she had blushed. This had worried me all the more because I had been told that the two girls, L\u00e9a\u2019s friends, frequented the bathing establishment of the hotel, and, it was said, not merely for the purpose of taking baths. But, for fear of annoying Albertine, or else deciding to await some more opportune moment, I had always refrained from mentioning it to her and in time had ceased to think about it. And all of a sudden, some time after Albertine\u2019s death, I recalled this memory, stamped with the mark, at once irritating and solemn, of riddles left for ever insoluble by the death of the one person who could have interpreted them. Might I not at least try to make certain that Albertine had never done anything wrong in that bathing establishment? By sending some one to Balbec I might perhaps succeed. While she was alive, I should doubtless have been unable to learn anything. But people\u2019s tongues become strangely loosened and they are ready to report a misdeed when they need no longer fear the culprit\u2019s resentment. As the constitution of our imagination, which has remained rudimentary, simplified (not having passed through the countless transformations which improve upon the primitive models of human inventions, barely recognisable, whether it be the barometer, the balloon, the telephone, or anything else, in their ultimate perfection), allows us to see only a very few things at one time, the memory of the bathing establishment occupied the whole field of my inward vision\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes I came in collision in the dark lanes of sleep with one of those bad dreams, which are not very serious for several reasons, one of these being that the sadness which they engender lasts for barely an hour after we awake, like the weakness that is caused by an artificial soporific. For another reason also, namely that we encounter them but very rarely, no more than once in two or three years. And moreover it remains uncertain whether we have encountered them before, whether they have not rather that aspect of not being seen for the first time which is projected over them by an illusion, a subdivision (for duplication would not be a strong enough term)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of course, since I entertained doubts as to the life, the death of Albertine, I ought long since to have begun to make inquiries, but the same weariness, the same cowardice which had made me give way to Albertine when she was with me prevented me from undertaking anything since I had ceased to see her. And yet from a weakness that had dragged on for years on end, a flash of energy sometimes emerged. I decided to make this investigation which, after all, was perfectly natural. One would have said that nothing else had occurred in Albertine\u2019s whole life. I asked myself whom I could best send down to make inquiries on the spot, at Balbec. Aim\u00e9 seemed to me to be a suitable person. Apart from his thorough knowledge of the place, he belonged to that category of plebeian folk who have a keen eye to their own advantage, are loyal to those whom they serve, indifferent to any thought of morality, and of whom \u2014 because, if we pay them well, in their obedience to our will, they suppress everything that might in one way or another go against it, shewing themselves as incapable of indiscretion, weakness or dishonesty as they are devoid of scruples \u2014 we say: \u201cThey are good fellows.\u201d In such we can repose an absolute confidence. When Aim\u00e9 had gone, I thought how much more to the point it would have been if, instead of sending him down to try to discover something there, I had now been able to question Albertine herself. And at once the thought of this question which I would have liked, which it seemed to me that I was about to put to her, having brought Albertine into my presence \u2014 not thanks to an effort of resurrection but as though by one of those chance encounters which, as is the case with photographs that are not posed, with snapshots, always make the person appear more alive \u2014 at the same time in which I imagined our conversation, I felt how impossible it was; I had just approached a fresh aspect of the idea that Albertine was dead, Albertine who inspired in me that affection which we have for the absent the sight of whom does not come to correct the embellished image, inspiring also sorrow that this absence must be eternal and that the poor child should be deprived for ever of the joys of life. And immediately, by an abrupt change of mood, from the torments of jealousy I passed to the despair of separation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What filled my heart now was, in the place of odious suspicions, the affectionate memory of hours of confiding tenderness spent with the sister whom death had really made me lose, since my grief was related not to what Albertine had been to me, but to what my heart, anxious to participate in the most general emotions of love, had gradually persuaded me that she was; then I became aware that the life which had bored me so \u2014 so, at least, I thought \u2014 had been on the contrary delicious, to the briefest moments spent in talking to her of things that were quite insignificant, I felt now that there was added, amalgamated a pleasure which at the time had not \u2014 it is true \u2014 been perceived by me, but which was already responsible for making me turn so perseveringly to those moments to the exclusion of any others; the most trivial incidents which I recalled, a movement that she had made in the carriage by my side, or to sit down facing me in my room, dispersed through my spirit an eddy of sweetness and sorrow which little by little overwhelmed it altogether\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This room in which we used to dine had never seemed to me attractive, I had told Albertine that it was attractive merely in order that my mistress might be content to live in it. Now the curtains, the chairs, the books, had ceased to be unimportant. Art is not alone in imparting charm and mystery to the most insignificant things; the same power of bringing them into intimate relation with ourselves is committed also to grief. At the moment I had paid no attention to the dinner which we had eaten together after our return from the Bois, before I went to the Verdurins\u2019, and towards the beauty, the solemn sweetness of which I now turned, my eyes filled with tears. An impression of love is out of proportion to the other impressions of life, but it is not when it is lost in their midst that we can take account of it. It is not from its foot, in the tumult of the street and amid the thronging houses, it is when we are far away, that from the slope of a neighbouring hill, at a distance from which the whole town has disappeared, or appears only as a confused mass upon the ground, we can, in the calm detachment of solitude and dusk, appreciate, unique, persistent and pure, the height of a cathedral. I tried to embrace the image of Albertine through my tears as I thought of all the serious and sensible things that she had said that evening\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One morning I thought that I could see the oblong shape of a hill swathed in mist, that I could taste the warmth of a cup of chocolate, while my heart was horribly wrung by the memory of that afternoon on which Albertine had come to see me and I had kissed her for the first time: the fact was that I had just heard the hiccough of the hot-water pipes, the furnace having just been started. And I flung angrily away an invitation which Fran\u00e7oise brought me from Mme. Verdurin; how the impression that I had felt when I went to dine for the first time at la Raspeli\u00e8re, that death does not strike us all at the same age, overcame me with increased force now that Albertine was dead, so young, while Brichot continued to dine with Mme. Verdurin who was still entertaining and would perhaps continue to entertain for many years to come. At once the name of Brichot recalled to me the end of that evening party when he had accompanied me home, when I had seen from the street the light of Albertine\u2019s lamp. I had already thought of it upon many occasions, but I had not approached this memory from the same angle. Then when I thought of the void which I should now find upon returning home, that I should never again see from the street Albertine\u2019s room, the light in which was extinguished for ever, I realised how, that evening, in parting from Brichot, I had thought that I was bored, that I regretted my inability to stroll about the streets and make love elsewhere, I realised how greatly I had been mistaken, that it was only because the treasure whose reflexions came down to me in the street had seemed to be entirely in my possession that I had failed to calculate its value, which meant that it seemed to me of necessity inferior to pleasures, however slight, of which however, in seeking to imagine them, I enhanced the value. I realised how much that light which had seemed to me to issue from a prison contained for me of fulness, of life and sweetness, all of which was but the realisation of what had for a moment intoxicated me and had then seemed for ever impossible: I began to understand that this life which I had led in Paris in a home which was also her home, was precisely the realisation of that profound peace of which I had dreamed on the night when Albertine had slept under the same roof as myself, at Balbec. The conversation which I had had with Albertine after our return from the Bois before that party at the Verdurins\u2019, I should not have been consoled had it never occurred, that conversation which had to some extent introduced Albertine into my intellectual life and in certain respects had made us one. For no doubt if I returned with melting affection to her intelligence, to her kindness to myself, it was not because they were any greater than those of other persons whom I had known. Had not Mme. de Cambremer said to me at Balbec: \u201cWhat! You might be spending your days with Elstir, who is a genius, and you spend them with your cousin!\u201d Albertine\u2019s intelligence pleased me because, by association, it revived in me what I called its sweetness as we call the sweetness of a fruit a certain sensation which exists only in our palate. And in fact, when I thought of Albertine\u2019s intelligence, my lips instinctively protruded and tasted a memory of which I preferred that the reality should remain external to me and should consist in the objective superiority of another person. There could be no denying that I had known people whose intelligence was greater. But the infinitude of love, or its egoism, has the result that the people whom we love are those whose intellectual and moral physiognomy is least defined objectively in our eyes, we alter them incessantly to suit our desires and fears, we do not separate them from ourselves: they are only a vast and vague place in which our affections take root. We have not of our own body, into which flow perpetually so many discomforts and pleasures, as clear an outline as we have of a tree or house, or of a passer-by. And where I had gone wrong was perhaps in not making more effort to know Albertine in herself. Just as, from the point of view of her charm, I had long considered only the different positions that she occupied in my memory in the procession of years, and had been surprised to see that she had been spontaneously enriched with modifications which were due merely to the difference of perspective, so I ought to have sought to understand her character as that of an ordinary person, and thus perhaps, finding an explanation of her persistence in keeping her secret from me, might have averted the continuance between us, with that strange desperation, of the conflict which had led to the death of Albertine. And I then felt, with an intense pity for her, shame at having survived her. It seemed to me indeed, in the hours when I suffered least, that I had derived a certain benefit from her death, for a woman is of greater service to our life if she is in it, instead of being an element of happiness, an instrument of sorrow, and there is not a woman in the world the possession of whom is as precious as that of the truths which she reveals to us by causing us to suffer. In these moments, thinking at once of my grandmother\u2019s death and of Albertine\u2019s, it seemed to me that my life was stained with a double murder from which only the cowardice of the world could absolve me. I had dreamed of being understood by Albertine, of not being scorned by her, thinking that it was for the great happiness of being understood, of not being scorned, when so many other people might have served me better. We wish to be understood, because we wish to be loved, and we wish to be loved because we are in love. The understanding of other people is immaterial and their love importunate. My joy at having possessed a little of Albertine\u2019s intelligence and of her heart arose not from their intrinsic worth, but from the fact that this possession was a stage farther towards the complete possession of Albertine, a possession which had been my goal and my chimera, since the day on which I first set eyes on her. When we speak of the \u2018kindness\u2019 of a woman, we do no more perhaps than project outside ourselves the pleasure that we feel in seeing her, like children when they say: \u201cMy dear little bed, my dear little pillow, my dear little hawthorns.\u201d Which explains incidentally why men never say of a woman who is not unfaithful to them: \u201cShe is so kind,\u201d and say it so often of a woman by whom they are betrayed. Mme. de Cambremer was right in thinking that Elstir\u2019s intellectual charm was greater. But we cannot judge in the same way the charm of a person who is, like everyone else, exterior to ourselves, painted upon the horizon of our mind, and that of a person who, in consequence of an error in localisation which has been due to certain accidents but is irreparable, has lodged herself in our own body so effectively that the act of asking ourselves in retrospect whether she did not look at a woman on a particular day in the corridor of a little seaside railway-tram makes us feel the same anguish as would a surgeon probing for a bullet in our heart. A simple crescent of bread, but one which we are eating, gives us more pleasure than all the ortolans, young rabbits and barbavelles that were set before Louis XV and the blade of grass which, a few inches away, quivers before our eye, while we are lying upon the mountain-side, may conceal from us the sheer summit of another peak, if it is several miles away\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, our mistake is our failure to value the intelligence, the kindness of a woman whom we love, however slight they may be. Our mistake is our remaining indifferent to the kindness, the intelligence of others. Falsehood begins to cause us the indignation, and kindness the gratitude which they ought always to arouse in us, only if they proceed from a woman with whom we are in love, and bodily desire has the marvellous faculty of restoring its value to intelligence and a solid base to the moral life. Never should I find again that divine thing, a person with whom I might talk freely of everything, in whom I might confide. Confide? But did not other people offer me greater confidence than Albertine? Had I not had with others more unrestricted conversations? The fact is that confidence, conversation, trivial things in themselves, what does it matter whether they are more or less imperfect, if only there enters into them love, which alone is divine. I could see Albertine now, seated at her pianola, rosy beneath her dark hair, I could feel, against my lips which she was trying to part, her tongue, her motherly, inedible, nourishing and holy tongue whose secret flame and dew meant that even when Albertine let it glide over the surface of my throat or stomach, those caresses, superficial but in a sense offered by her inmost flesh, turned outward like a cloth that is turned to shew its lining, assumed even in the most external touches as it were the mysterious delight of a penetration\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All these so pleasant moments which nothing would ever restore to me again, I cannot indeed say that what made me feel the loss of them was despair. To feel despair, we must still be attached to that life which could end only in disaster. I had been in despair at Balbec when I saw the day break and realised that none of the days to come could ever be a happy day for me, I had remained fairly selfish since then, but the self to which I was now attached, the self which constituted those vital reserves that were set in action by the instinct of self-preservation, this self was no longer alive; when I thought of my strength, of my vital force, of the best elements in myself, I thought of a certain treasure which I had possessed (which I had been alone in possessing since other people could not know exactly the sentiment, concealed in myself, which it had inspired in me) and which no one could ever again take from me since I possessed it no longer\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, to tell the truth, when I had ever possessed it, it had been only because I had liked to think of myself as possessing it. I had not merely committed the imprudence, when I cast my eyes upon Albertine and lodged her in my heart, of making her live within me, nor that other imprudence of combining a domestic affection with sensual pleasure. I had sought also to persuade myself that our relations were love, that we were mutually practising the relations that are called love, because she obediently returned the kisses that I gave her, and, having come in time to believe this, I had lost not merely a woman whom I loved but a woman who loved me, my sister, my child, my tender mistress. And in short, I had received a blessing and a curse which Swann had not known, for after all during the whole of the time in which he had been in love with Odette and had been so jealous of her, he had barely seen her, having found it so difficult, on certain days when she put him off at the last moment, to gain admission to her. But afterwards he had had her to himself, as his wife, and until the day of his death. I, on the contrary, while I was so jealous of Albertine, more fortunate than Swann, had had her with me in my own house. I had realised as a fact the state of which Swann had so often dreamed and which he did not realise materially until it had ceased to interest him. But after all I had not managed to keep Albertine as he had kept Odette. She had fled from me, she was dead. For nothing is ever repeated exactly, and the most analogous lives which, thanks to the kinship of the persons and the similarity of the circumstances, we may select in order to represent them as symmetrical, remain in many respects opposite\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By losing my life I should not have lost very much; I should have lost now only an empty form, the empty frame of a work of art. Indifferent as to what I might in the future put in it, but glad and proud to think of what it had contained, I dwelt upon the memory of those so pleasant hours, and this moral support gave me a feeling of comfort which the approach of death itself would not have disturbed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How she used to hasten to see me at Balbec when I sent for her, lingering only to sprinkle scent on her hair to please me. These images of Balbec and Paris which I loved to see again were the pages still so recent, and so quickly turned, of her short life. All this which for me was only memory had been for her action, action as precipitate as that of a tragedy towards a sudden death. People develop in one way inside us, but in another way outside us (I had indeed felt this on those evenings when I remarked in Albertine an enrichment of qualities which was due not only to my memory), and these two ways do not fail to react upon each other. Albeit I had, in seeking to know Albertine, then to possess her altogether, obeyed merely the need to reduce by experiment to elements meanly similar to those of our own self the mystery of every other person, I had been unable to do so without exercising an influence in my turn over Albertine\u2019s life. Perhaps my wealth, the prospect of a brilliant marriage had attracted her, my jealousy had kept her, her goodness or her intelligence, or her sense of guilt, or her cunning had made her accept, and had led me on to make harsher and harsher a captivity in chains forged simply by the internal process of my mental toil, which had nevertheless had, upon Albertine\u2019s life, reactions, destined themselves to set, by the natural swing of the pendulum, fresh and ever more painful problems to my psychology, since from my prison she had escaped, to go and kill herself upon a horse which but for me she would not have owned, leaving me, even after she was dead, with suspicions the verification of which, if it was to come, would perhaps be more painful to me than the discovery at Balbec that Albertine had known Mlle. Vinteuil, since Albertine would no longer be present to soothe me. So that the long plaint of the soul which thinks that it is living shut up within itself is a monologue in appearance only, since the echoes of reality alter its course and such a life is like an essay in subjective psychology spontaneously pursued, but furnishing from a distance its \u2018action\u2019 to the purely realistic novel of another reality, another existence, the vicissitudes of which come in their turn to inflect the curve and change the direction of the psychological essay. How highly geared had been the mechanism, how rapid had been the evolution of our love, and, notwithstanding the sundry delays, interruptions and hesitations of the start, as in certain of Balzac\u2019s tales or Schumann\u2019s ballads, how sudden the catastrophe! It was in the course of this last year, long as a century to me, so many times had Albertine changed her appearance in my mind between Balbec and her departure from Paris, and also, independently of me and often without my knowledge, changed in herself, that I must place the whole of that happy life of affection which had lasted so short a while, which yet appeared to me with an amplitude, almost an immensity, which now was for ever impossible and yet was indispensable to me. Indispensable without perhaps having been in itself and at the outset a thing that was necessary since I should not have known Albertine had I not read in an archaeological treatise a description of the church at Balbec, had not Swann, by telling me that this church was almost Persian, directed my taste to the Byzantine Norman, had not a financial syndicate, by erecting at Balbec a hygienic and comfortable hotel, made my parents decide to hear my supplication and send me to Balbec. To be sure, in that Balbec so long desired I had not found the Persian church of my dreams, nor the eternal mists. Even the famous train at one twenty-two had not corresponded to my mental picture of it. But in compensation for what our imagination leaves us wanting and we give ourselves so much unnecessary trouble in trying to find, life does give us something which we were very far from imagining. Who would have told me at Combray, when I lay waiting for my mother\u2019s good-night with so heavy a heart, that those anxieties would be healed, and would then break out again one day, not for my mother, but for a girl who would at first be no more, against the horizon of the sea, than a flower upon which my eyes would daily be invited to gaze, but a flower that could think, and in whose mind I should be so childishly anxious to occupy a prominent place, that I should be distressed by her not being aware that I knew Mme. de Villeparisis? Yes, it was the good-night, the kiss of a stranger like this, that, in years to come, was to make me suffer as keenly as I had suffered as a child when my mother was not coming up to my room. Well, this Albertine so necessary, of love for whom my soul was now almost entirely composed, if Swann had not spoken to me of Balbec, I should never have known her. Her life would perhaps have been longer, mine would have been unprovided with what was now making it a martyrdom. And also it seemed to me that, by my entirely selfish affection, I had allowed Albertine to die just as I had murdered my grandmother. Even later on, even after I had already known her at Balbec, I should have been able not to love her as I was to love her in the sequel. When I gave up Gilberte and knew that I would be able one day to love another woman, I scarcely ventured to entertain a doubt whether, considering simply the past, Gilberte was the only woman whom I had been capable of loving. Well, in the case of Albertine I had no longer any doubt at all, I was sure that it need not have been herself that I loved, that it might have been some one else. To prove this, it would have been sufficient that Mlle. de Stermaria, on the evening when I was going to take her to dine on the island in the Bois, should not have put me off. It was still not too late, and it would have been upon Mlle. de Stermaria that I would have trained that activity of the imagination which makes us extract from a woman so special a notion of the individual that she appears to us unique in herself and predestined and necessary for us. At the most, adopting an almost physiological point of view, I could say that I might have been able to feel this same exclusive love for another woman but not for any other woman. For Albertine, plump and dark, did not resemble Gilberte, tall and ruddy, and yet they were fashioned of the same healthy stuff, and over the same sensual cheeks shone a look in the eyes of both which it was difficult to interpret. They were women of a sort that would never attract the attention of men who, for their part, would do the most extravagant things for other women who made no appeal to me. A man has almost always the same way of catching cold, and so forth; that is to say, he requires to bring about the event a certain combination of circumstances; it is natural that when he falls in love he should love a certain class of woman, a class which for that matter is very numerous. The two first glances from Albertine which had set me dreaming were not absolutely different from Gilberte\u2019s first glances. I could almost believe that the obscure personality, the sensuality, the forward, cunning nature of Gilberte had returned to tempt me, incarnate this time in Albertine\u2019s body, a body quite different and yet not without analogies. In Albertine\u2019s case, thanks to a wholly different life shared with me into which had been unable to penetrate \u2014 in a block of thoughts among which a painful preoccupation maintained a permanent cohesion \u2014 any fissure of distraction and oblivion, her living body had indeed not, like Gilberte\u2019s, ceased one day to be the body in which I found what I subsequently recognised as being to me (what they would not have been to other men) feminine charms. But she was dead. I should, in time, forget her. Who could tell whether then, the same qualities of rich blood, of uneasy brooding would return one day to spread havoc in my life, but incarnate this time in what feminine form I could not foresee. The example of Gilberte would as little have enabled me to form an idea of Albertine and guess that I should fall in love with her, as the memory of Vinteuil\u2019s sonata would have enabled me to imagine his septet. Indeed, what was more, on the first occasions of my meeting Albertine, I might have supposed that it was with other girls that I should fall in love. Besides, she might indeed quite well have appeared to me, had I met her a year earlier, as dull as a grey sky in which dawn has not yet broken. If I had changed in relation to her, she herself had changed also, and the girl who had come and sat Upon my bed on the day of my letter to Mlle. de Stermaria was no longer the same girl that I had known at Balbec, whether by a mere explosion of the woman which occurs at the age of puberty, or because of some incident which I have never been able to discover. In any case if she whom I was one day to love must to a certain extent resemble this other, that is to say if my choice of a woman was not entirely free, this meant nevertheless that, trained in a manner that was perhaps inevitable, it was trained upon something more considerable than a person, upon a type of womankind, and this removed all inevitability from my love for Albertine. The woman whose face we have before our eyes more constantly than light itself, since, even when our eyes are shut, we never cease for an instant to adore her beautiful eyes, her beautiful nose, to arrange opportunities of seeing them again, this unique woman \u2014 we know quite well that it would have been another woman that would now be unique to us if we had been in another town than that in which we made her acquaintance, if we had explored other quarters of the town, if we had frequented the house of a different hostess. Unique, we suppose; she is innumerable. And yet she is compact, indestructible in our loving eyes, irreplaceable for a long time to come by any other. The truth is that the woman has only raised to life by a sort of magic spell a thousand elements of affection existing in us already in a fragmentary state, which she has assembled, joined together, bridging every gap between them, it is ourselves who by giving her her features have supplied all the solid matter of the beloved object. Whence it comes about that even if we are only one man among a thousand to her and perhaps the last man of them all, to us she is the only woman, the woman towards whom our whole life tends. It was indeed true that I had been quite well aware that this love was not inevitable since it might have occurred with Mlle. de Stermaria, but even without that from my knowledge of the love itself, when I found it to be too similar to what I had known with other women, and also when I felt it to be vaster than Albertine, enveloping her, unconscious of her, like a tide swirling round a tiny rock. But gradually, by dint of living with Albertine, the chains which I myself had forged I was unable to fling off, the habit of associating Albertine\u2019s person with the sentiment which she had not inspired made me nevertheless believe that ft was peculiar to her, as habit gives to the mere association of ideas between two phenomena, according to a certain school of philosophy, an illusion of the force, the necessity of a law of causation. I had thought that my social relations, my wealth, would dispense me from suffering, and too effectively perhaps since this seemed to dispense me from feeling, loving, imagining; I envied a poor country girl whom her absence of social relations, even by telegraph, allows to ponder for months on end upon a grief which she cannot artificially put to sleep. And now I began to realise that if, in the case of Mme. de Guermantes, endowed with everything that could make the gulf infinite between her and myself, I had seen that gulf suddenly bridged by the opinion that social advantages are nothing more than inert and transmutable matter, so, in a similar albeit converse fashion, my social relations, my wealth, all the material means by which not only my own position but the civilisation of my age enabled me to profit, had done no more than postpone the conclusion of my struggle against the contrary inflexible will of Albertine upon which no pressure had had any effect. True, I had been able to exchange telegrams, telephone messages with Saint-Loup, to remain in constant communication with the office at Tours, but had not the delay in waiting for them proved useless, the result nil? And country girls, without social advantages or relations, or human beings enjoying the perfections of civilisation, do they not suffer less, because all of us desire less, because we regret less what we have always known to be inaccessible, what for that reason has continued to seem unreal? We desire more keenly the person who is about to give herself to us; hope anticipates possession; but regret also is an amplifier of desire. Mme. de Stermaria\u2019s refusal to come and dine with me on the island in the Bois was what had prevented her from becoming the object of my love. This might have sufficed also to make me fall in love with her if afterwards I had seen her again before it was too late. As soon as I had known that she was not coming, entertaining the improbable hypothesis \u2014 which had been proved correct \u2014 that perhaps she had a jealous lover who prevented her from seeing other men, that I should never see her again, I had suffered so intensely that I would have given anything in the world to see her, and it was one of the keenest anguishes that I had ever felt that Saint-Loup\u2019s arrival had soothed. After we have reached a certain age our loves, our mistresses, are begotten of our anguish; our past, and the physical lesions in which it is recorded, determine our future. In Albertine\u2019s case, the fact that it would not necessarily be she that I must love was, even without the example of those previous loves, inscribed in the history of my love for her, that is to say for herself and her friends. For it was not a single love like my love for Gilberte, but was created by division among a number of girls. That it was on her account and because they appeared to me more or less similar to her that I had amused myself with her friends was quite possible. The fact remains that for a long time hesitation among them all was possible, my choice strayed from one to another, and when I thought that I preferred one, it was enough that another should keep me waiting, should refuse to see me, to make me feel the first premonitions of love for her. Often at that time when Andr\u00e9e was coming to see me at Balbec, if, shortly before Andr\u00e9e was expected, Albertine failed to keep an appointment, my heart throbbed without ceasing, I felt that I would never see her again and that it was she whom I loved. And when Andr\u00e9e came it was in all seriousness that I said to her (as I said it to her in Paris after I had learned that Albertine had known Mlle. Vinteuil) what she supposed me to be saying with a purpose, without sincerity, what I would indeed have said and in the same words had I been enjoying myself the day before with Albertine: \u201cAlas! If you had only come sooner, now I am in love with some one else.\u201d Again, in this case of Andr\u00e9e, replaced by Albertine after I learned that the latter had known Mlle. Vinteuil, my love had alternated between them, so that after all there had been only one love at a time. But a case had occurred earlier in which I had more or less quarrelled with two of the girls. The one who took the first step towards a reconciliation would restore my peace of mind, it was the other that I would love, if she remained cross with me, which does not mean that it was not with the former that I would form a definite tie, for she would console me \u2014 albeit ineffectively \u2014 for the harshness of the other, whom I would end by forgetting if she did not return to me again. Now, it so happened that, while I was convinced that one or the other at least would come back to me, for some time neither of them did so. My anguish was therefore twofold, and twofold my love, while I reserved to myself the right to cease to love the one who came back, but until that happened continued to suffer on account of them both. It is the lot of a certain period in life which may come to us quite early that we are made less amorous by a person than by a desertion, in which we end by knowing one thing and one thing only about that person, her face having grown dim, her heart having ceased to exist, our preference of her being quite recent and inexplicable; namely that what we need to make our suffering cease is a message from her: \u201cMay I come and see you?\u201d My separation from Albertine on the day when Fran\u00e7oise informed me: \u201cMademoiselle Albertine has gone\u201d was like an allegory of countless other separations. For very often in order that we may discover that we are in love, perhaps indeed in order that we may fall in love, the day of separation must first have come. In the case when it is an unkept appointment, a written refusal that dictates our choice, our imagination lashed by suffering sets about its work so swiftly, fashions with so frenzied a rapidity a love that had scarcely begun, and had been quite featureless, destined, for months past, to remain a rough sketch, that now and again our intelligence which has not been able to keep pace with our heart, cries out in astonishment: \u201cBut you must be mad, what are these strange thoughts that are making you so miserable? That is not real life.\u201d And indeed at that moment, had we not been roused to action by the betrayer, a few healthy distractions that would calm our heart physically would be sufficient to bring our love to an end. In any case if this life with Albertine was not in its essence necessary, it had become indispensable to me. I had trembled when I was in love with Mme. de Guermantes because I used to say to myself that, with her too abundant means of attraction, not only beauty but position, wealth, she would be too much at liberty to give herself to all and sundry, that I should have too little hold over her. Albertine had been penniless, obscure, she must have been anxious to marry me. And yet I had not been able to possess her exclusively. Whatever be our social position, however wise our precautions, when the truth is confessed we have no hold over the life of another person. Why had she not said to me: \u201cI have those tastes,\u201d I would have yielded, would have allowed her to gratify them. In a novel that I had been reading there was a woman whom no objurgation from the man who was in love with her could induce to speak. When I read the book, I had thought this situation absurd; had I been the hero, I assured myself, I would first of all have forced the woman to speak, then we could have come to an understanding; what was the good of all this unnecessary misery? But I saw now that we are not free to abstain from forging the chains of our own misery, and that however well we may know our own will, other people do not obey it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And yet those painful, those ineluctable truths which dominated us and to which we were blind, the truth of our sentiments, the truth of our destiny, how often without knowing it, without meaning it, we have expressed them in words in which we ourselves doubtless thought that we were lying, but the prophetic value of which has been established by subsequent events. I could recall many words that each of us had uttered without knowing at the time the truth that they contained, which indeed we had said thinking that each was deceiving the other, words the falsehood of which was very slight, quite uninteresting, wholly confined within our pitiable insincerity, compared with what they contained that was unknown to us. Lies, mistakes, falling short of the reality which neither of us perceived, truth extending beyond it, the truth of our natures the essential laws of which escape us and require time before they reveal themselves, the truth of our destinies also. I had supposed that I was lying when I said to her at Balbec: \u201cThe more I see you, the more I shall love you\u201d (and yet it was that intimacy at every moment that had, through the channel of jealousy, attached me so strongly to her), \u201cI know that I could be of use to you intellectually\u201d; and in Paris: \u201cDo be careful. Remember that if you met with an accident, it would break my heart.\u201d And she: \u201cBut I may meet with an accident\u201d; and I in Paris on the evening when I pretended that I wished to part from her: \u201cLet me look at you once again since presently I shall not be seeing you again, and it will be for ever!\u201d and when, that same evening, she looked round the room: \u201cTo think that I shall never see this room again, those books, that pianola, the whole house, I cannot believe it and yet it is true.\u201d In her last letters again, when she wrote \u2014 probably saying to herself: \u201cThis is the stuff to tell him\u201d\u2014\u201cI leave with you the best part of myself\u201d (and was it not now indeed to the fidelity, to the strength, which too was, alas, frail, of my memory that were entrusted her intelligence, her goodness, her beauty?) and \u201cthat twofold twilight (since night was falling and we were about to part) will be effaced from my thoughts only when the darkness is complete,\u201d that phrase written on the eve of the day when her mind had indeed been plunged in complete darkness, and when, it may well have been, in the last glimmer, so brief but stretched out to infinity by the anxiety of the moment, she had indeed perhaps seen again our last drive together and in that instant when everything forsakes us and we create a faith for ourselves, as atheists turn Christian upon the battlefield, she had perhaps summoned to her aid the friend whom she had so often cursed but had so deeply respected, who himself \u2014 for all religions are alike \u2014 was so cruel as to hope that she had also had time to see herself as she was, to give her last thought to him, to confess her sins at length to him, to die in him. But to what purpose, since even if, at that moment, she had had time to see herself as she was, we had neither of us understood where our happiness lay, what we ought to do, until that happiness, because that happiness was no longer possible, until and because we could no longer realise it. So long as things are possible we postpone them, and they cannot assume that force of attraction, that apparent ease of realisation save when, projected upon the ideal void of the imagination, they are removed from their burdensome, degrading submersion in the vital medium. The thought that we must die is more painful than the act of dying, but less painful than the thought that another person is dead, which, becoming once more a plane surface after having engulfed a person, extends without even an eddy at the point of disappearance, a reality from which that person is excluded, in which there exists no longer any will, any knowledge, and from which it is as difficult to reascend to the thought that the person has lived, as it is difficult, with the still recent memory of her life, to think that she is now comparable with the unsubstantial images, with the memories left us by the characters in a novel which we have been reading\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At any rate I was glad that, before she died, she had written me that letter, and above all had sent me that final message which proved to me that she would have returned had she lived. It seemed to me that it was not merely more soothing, but more beautiful also, that the event would have been incomplete without this note, would not have had so markedly the form of art and destiny. In reality it would have been just as markedly so had it been different; for every event is like a mould of a particular shape, and, whatever it be, it imposes, upon the series of incidents which it has interrupted and seems to have concluded, a pattern which we believe to be the only one possible, because we do not know the other which might have been substituted for it. I repeated to myself: \u201cWhy had she not said to me: \u2018I have those tastes,\u2019 I would have yielded, would have allowed her to gratify them, at this moment I should be kissing her still.\u201d What a sorrow to have to remind myself that she had lied to me thus when she swore to me, three days before she left me, that she had never had with Mlle. Vinteuil\u2019s friend those relations which at the moment when Albertine swore it her blush had confessed. Poor child, she had at least had the honesty to refuse to swear that the pleasure of seeing Mlle. Vinteuil again had no part in her desire to go that day to the Verdurins\u2019. Why had she not made her admission complete, why had she then invented that inconceivable tale? Perhaps however it was partly my fault that she had never, despite all my entreaties which were powerless against her denial, been willing to say to me: \u201cI have those tastes.\u201d It was perhaps partly my fault because at Balbec, on the day when, after Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s call, I had had my first explanation with Albertine, and when I was so far from imagining that she could have had, in any case, anything more than an unduly passionate friendship with Andr\u00e9e, I had expressed with undue violence my disgust at that kind of moral lapse, had condemned it in too categorical a fashion. I could not recall whether Albertine had blushed when I had innocently expressed my horror of that sort of thing, I could not recall it, for it is often only long afterwards that we would give anything to know what attitude a person adopted at a moment when we were paying no attention to it, an attitude which, later on, when we think again of our conversation, would elucidate a poignant difficulty. But in our memory there is a blank, there is no trace of it. And very often we have not paid sufficient attention, at the actual moment, to the things which might even then have seemed to us important, we have not properly heard a sentence, have not noticed a gesture, or else we have forgotten them. And when later on, eager to discover a truth, we reascend from deduction to deduction, turning over our memory like a sheaf of written evidence, when we arrive at that sentence, at that gesture, which it is impossible to recall, we begin again a score of times the same process, but in vain: the road goes no farther. Had she blushed? I did not know whether she had blushed, but she could not have failed to hear, and the memory of my speech had brought her to a halt later on when perhaps she had been on the point of making her confession to me. And now she no longer existed anywhere, I might scour the earth from pole to pole without finding Albertine. The reality which had closed over her was once more unbroken, had obliterated every trace of the creature who had sunk into its depths. She was no more now than a name, like that Mme. de Charlus of whom the people who had known her said with indifference: \u201cShe was charming.\u201d But I was unable to conceive for more than an instant the existence of this reality of which Albertine had no knowledge, for in myself my mistress existed too vividly, in myself in whom every sentiment, every thought bore some reference to her life. Perhaps if she had known, she would have been touched to see that her lover had not forgotten her, now that her own life was finished, and would have been moved by things which in the past had left her indifferent. But as we would choose to refrain from infidelities, however secret they might be, so fearful are we that she whom we love is not refraining from them, I was alarmed by the thought that if the dead do exist anywhere, my grandmother was as well aware of my oblivion as Albertine of my remembrance. And when all is said, even in the case of a single dead person, can we be sure that the joy which we should feel in learning that she knows certain things would compensate for our alarm at the thought that she knows all; and, however agonising the sacrifice, would we not sometimes abstain from keeping after their death as friends those whom we have loved, from the fear of having them also as judges?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My jealous curiosity as to what Albertine might have done was unbounded. I suborned any number of women from whom I learned nothing. If this curiosity was so keen, it was because people do not die at once for us, they remain bathed in a sort of aura of life in which there is no true immortality but which means that they continue to occupy our thoughts in the same way as when they were alive. It is as though they were travelling abroad. This is a thoroughly pagan survival. Conversely, when we have ceased to love her, the curiosity which the person arouses dies before she herself is dead. Thus I would no longer have taken any step to find out with whom Gilberte had been strolling on a certain evening in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Now I felt that these curiosities were absolutely alike, had no value in themselves, were incapable of lasting, but I continued to sacrifice everything to the cruel satisfaction of this transient curiosity, albeit I knew in advance that my enforced separation from Albertine, by the fact of her death, would lead me to the same indifference as had resulted from my deliberate separation from Gilberte\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If she could have known what was about to happen, she would have stayed with me. But this meant no more than that, once she saw herself dead, she would have preferred, in my company, to remain alive. Simply in view of the contradiction that it implied, such a supposition was absurd. But it was not innocuous, for in imagining how glad Albertine would be, if she could know, if she could retrospectively understand, to come back to me, I saw her before me, I wanted to kiss her; and alas, it was impossible, she would never come back, she was dead. My imagination sought for her in the sky, through the nights on which we had gazed at it when still together; beyond that moonlight which she loved, I tried to raise up to her my affection so that it might be a consolation to her for being no longer alive, and this love for a being so remote was like a religion, my thoughts rose towards her like prayers. Desire is very powerful, it engenders belief; I had believed that Albertine would not leave me because I desired that she might not. Because I desired it, I began to believe that she was not dead; I took to reading books upon table-turning, I began to believe in the possibility of the immortality of the soul. But that did not suffice me. I required that, after my own death, I should find her again in her body, as though eternity were like life. Life, did I say! I was more exacting still. I would have wished not to be deprived for ever by death of the pleasures of which however it is not alone in robbing us. For without her death they would eventually have grown faint, they had begun already to do so by the action of long-established habit, of fresh curiosities. Besides, had she been alive, Albertine, even physically, would gradually have changed, day by day I should have adapted myself to that change. But my memory, calling up only detached moments of her life, asked to see her again as she would already have ceased to be, had she lived; what it required was a miracle which would satisfy the natural and arbitrary limitations of memory which cannot emerge from the past. With the simplicity of the old theologians, I imagined her furnishing me not indeed with the explanations which she might possibly have given me but, by a final contradiction, with those that she had always refused me during her life. And thus, her death being a sort of dream, my love would seem to her an unlooked-for happiness; I saw in death only the convenience and optimism of a solution which simplifies, which arranges everything. Sometimes it was not so far off, it was not in another world that I imagined our reunion. Just as in the past, when I knew Gilberte only from playing with her in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, at home in the evening I used to imagine that I was going to receive a letter from her in which she would confess her love for me, that she was coming into the room, so a similar force of desire, no more embarrassed by the laws of nature which ran counter to it than on the former occasion in the case of Gilberte, when after all it had not been mistaken since it had had the last word, made me think now that I was going to receive a message from Albertine, informing me that she had indeed met with an accident while riding, but that for romantic reasons (and as, after all, has sometimes happened with people whom we have long believed to be dead) she had not wished me to hear of her recovery and now, repentant, asked to be allowed to come and live with me for ever. And, making quite clear to myself the nature of certain harmless manias in people who otherwise appear sane, I felt coexisting in myself the certainty that she was dead and the incessant hope that I might see her come into the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had not yet received any news from Aim\u00e9, albeit he must by now have reached Balbec. No doubt my inquiry turned upon a secondary point, and one quite arbitrarily selected. If Albertine\u2019s life had been really culpable, it must have contained many other things of far greater importance, which chance had not allowed me to touch, as it had allowed me that conversation about the wrapper, thanks to Albertine\u2019s blushes. It was quite arbitrarily that I had been presented with that particular day, which many years later I was seeking to reconstruct. If Albertine had been a lover of women, there were thousands of other days in her life her employment of which I did not know and about which it might be as interesting for me to learn; I might have sent Aim\u00e9 to many other places in Balbec, to many other towns than Balbec. But these other days, precisely because I did not know how she had spent them, did not represent themselves to my imagination. They had no existence. Things, people, did not begin to exist for me until they assumed in my imagination an individual existence. If there were thousands of others like them, they became for me representative of all the rest. If I had long felt a desire to know, in the matter of my suspicions with regard to Albertine, what exactly had happened in the baths, it was in the same manner in which, in the matter of my desires for women, and although I knew that there were any number of girls and lady\u2019s-maids who could satisfy them and whom chance might just as easily have led me to hear mentioned, I wished to know \u2014 since it was of them that Saint-Loup had spoken to me \u2014 the girl who frequented houses of ill fame and Mme. Putbus\u2019s maid. The difficulties which my health, my indecision, my \u2018procrastination,\u2019 as M. de Charlus called it, placed in the way of my carrying out any project, had made me put off from day to day, from month to month, from year to year, the elucidation of certain suspicions as also the accomplishment of certain desires. But I kept them in my memory promising myself that I would not forget to learn the truth of them, because they alone obsessed me (since the others had no form in my eyes, did not exist), and also because the very accident that had chosen them out of the surrounding reality gave me a guarantee that it was indeed in them that I should come in contact with a trace of reality, of the true and coveted life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Besides, from a single fact, if it is certain, can we not, like a scientist making experiments, extract the truth as to all the orders of similar facts? Is not a single little fact, if it is well chosen, sufficient to enable the experimenter to deduce a general law which will make him know the truth as to thousands of analogous facts?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Albertine might indeed exist in my memory only in the state in which she had successively appeared to me in the course of her life, that is to say subdivided according to a series of fractions of time, my mind, reestablishing unity in her, made her a single person, and it was upon this person that I sought to bring a general judgment to bear, to know whether she had lied to me, whether she loved women, whether it was in order to be free to associate with them that she had left me. What the woman in the baths would have to say might perhaps put an end for ever to my doubts as to Albertine\u2019s morals\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My doubts! Alas, I had supposed that it would be immaterial to me, even pleasant, not to see Albertine again, until her departure revealed to me my error. Similarly her death had shewn me how greatly I had been mistaken when I believed that I hoped at times for her death and supposed that it would be my deliverance. So it was that, when I received Aim\u00e9\u2018s letter, I realised that, if I had not until then suffered too painfully from my doubts as to Albertine\u2019s virtue, it was because in reality they were not doubts at all. My happiness, my life required that Albertine should be virtuous, they had laid it down once and for all time that she was. Furnished with this preservative belief, I could without danger allow my mind to play sadly with suppositions to which it gave a form but added no faith. I said to myself, \u201cShe is perhaps a woman-lover,\u201d as we say, \u201cI may die to-night\u201d; we say it, but we do not believe it, we make plans for the morrow. This explains why, believing mistakenly that I was uncertain whether Albertine did or did not love women, and believing in consequence that a proof of Albertine\u2019s guilt would not give me anything that I had not already taken into account, I was able to feel before the pictures, insignificant to anyone else, which Aim\u00e9\u2018s letter called up to me, an unexpected anguish, the most painful that I had ever yet felt, and one that formed with those pictures, with the picture, alas! of Albertine herself, a sort of precipitate, as chemists say, in which the whole was invisible and of which the text of Aim\u00e9\u2018s letter, which I isolate in a purely conventional fashion, can give no idea whatsoever, since each of the words that compose it was immediately transformed, coloured for ever by the suffering that it had aroused\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMONSIEUR\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMonsieur will kindly forgive me for not having written sooner to Monsieur. The person whom Monsieur instructed me to see had gone away for a few days, and, anxious to justify the confidence which Monsieur had placed in me, I did not wish to return empty-handed. I have just spoken to this person who remembers (Mlle. A.) quite well.\u201d Aim\u00e9 who possessed certain rudiments of culture meant to italicise Mlle. A. between inverted commas. But when he meant to write inverted commas, he wrote brackets, and when he meant to write something in brackets he put it between inverted commas. Thus it was that Fran\u00e7oise would say that some one stayed in my street meaning that he abode there, and that one could abide for a few minutes, meaning stay, the mistakes of popular speech consisting merely, as often as not, in interchanging \u2014 as for that matter the French language has done \u2014 terms which in the course of centuries have replaced one another. \u201cAccording to her the thing that Monsieur supposed is absolutely certain. For one thing, it was she who looked after (Mlle. A.) whenever she came to the baths. (Mlle. A.) came very often to take her bath with a tall woman older than herself, always dressed in grey, whom the bath-woman without knowing her name recognised from having often seen her going after girls. But she took no notice of any of them after she met (Mlle. A.). She and (Mlle. A.) always shut themselves up in the dressing-box, remained there a very long time, and the lady in grey used to give at least 10 francs as a tip to the person to whom I spoke. As this person said to me, you can imagine that if they were just stringing beads, they wouldn\u2019t have given a tip of ten francs. (Mlle. A.) used to come also sometimes with a woman with a very dark skin and long-handled glasses. But (Mlle. A.) came most often with girls younger than herself, especially one with a high complexion. Apart from the lady in grey, the people whom (Mlle. A.) was in the habit of bringing were not from Balbec and must indeed often have come from quite a distance. They never came in together, but (Mlle. A.) would come in, and ask for the door of her box to be left unlocked \u2014 as she was expecting a friend, and the person to whom I spoke knew what that meant. This person could not give me any other details, as she does not remember very well, which is easily understood after so long an interval.\u2019 Besides, this person did not try to find out, because she is very discreet and it was to her advantage, for (Mlle. A.) brought her in a lot of money. She was quite sincerely touched to hear that she was dead. It is true that so young it is a great calamity for her and for her friends. I await Monsieur\u2019s orders to know whether I may leave Balbec where I do not think that I can learn anything more. I thank Monsieur again for the little holiday that he has procured me, and which has been very pleasant especially as the weather is as fine as could be. The season promises well for this year. We hope that Monsieur will come and put in a little appearance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can think of nothing else to say that will interest Monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To understand how deeply these words penetrated my being, the reader must bear in mind that the questions which I had been asking myself with regard to Albertine were not subordinate, immaterial questions, questions of detail, the only questions as a matter of fact which we ask ourselves about anyone who is not ourselves, whereby we are enabled to proceed, wrapped in an impenetrable thought, through the midst of suffering, falsehood, vice or death. No, in Albertine\u2019s case, they were essential questions: \u201cIn her heart of hearts what was she? What were her thoughts? What were her loves? Did she lie to me? Had my life with her been as lamentable as Swann\u2019s life with Odette?\u201d And so the point reached by Aim\u00e9\u2018s reply, even although it was not a general reply \u2014 and precisely for that reason \u2014 was indeed in Albertine, in myself, the uttermost depths\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At last I saw before my eyes, in that arrival of Albertine at the baths along the narrow lane with the lady in grey, a fragment of that past which seemed to me no less mysterious, no less alarming than I had feared when I imagined it as enclosed in the memory, in the facial expression of Albertine. No doubt anyone but myself might have dismissed as insignificant these details, upon which my inability, now that Albertine was dead, to secure a denial of them from herself, conferred the equivalent of a sort of likelihood. It is indeed probable that for Albertine, even if they had been true, her own misdeeds, if she had admitted them, whether her conscience thought them innocent or reprehensible, whether her sensuality had found them exquisite or distinctly dull, would not have been accompanied by that inexpressible sense of horror from which I was unable to detach them. I myself, with the help of my own love of women, albeit they could not have been the same thing to Albertine, could more or less imagine what she felt. And indeed it was already a first degree of anguish, merely to picture her to myself desiring as I had so often desired, lying to me as I had so often lied to her, preoccupied with one girl or another, putting herself out for her, as I had done for Mlle. de Stermaria and ever so many others, not to mention the peasant girls whom I met on country roads. Yes, all my own desires helped me to understand, to a certain degree, what hers had been; it was by this time an intense anguish in which all my desires, the keener they had been, had changed into torments that were all the more cruel; as though in this algebra of sensibility they reappeared with the same coefficient but with a minus instead of a plus sign. To Albertine, so far as I was capable of judging her by my own standard, her misdeeds, however anxious she might have been to conceal them from me \u2014 which made me suppose that she was conscious of her guilt or was afraid of grieving me \u2014 her misdeeds because she had planned them to suit her own taste in the clear light of imagination in which desire plays, appeared to her nevertheless as things of the same nature as the rest of life, pleasures for herself which she had not had the courage to deny herself, griefs for me which she had sought to avoid causing me by concealing them, but pleasures and griefs which might be numbered among the other pleasures and griefs of life. But for me, it was from without, without my having been forewarned, without my having been able myself to elaborate them, it was from Aim\u00e9\u2018s letter that there had come to me the visions of Albertine arriving at the baths and preparing her gratuity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No doubt it was because in that silent and deliberate arrival of Albertine with the woman in grey I read the assignation that they had made, that convention of going to make love in a dressing-box which implied an experience of corruption, the well-concealed organisation of & double life, it was because these images brought me the terrible tidings of Albertine\u2019s guilt that they had immediately caused me a physical grief from which they would never in time to come be detached. But at once my grief had reacted upon them: an objective fact, such as an image, differs according to the internal state in which we approach it. And grief is as potent in altering reality as is drunkenness. Combined with these images, suffering had at once made of them something absolutely different from what might be for anyone else a lady in grey, a gratuity, a bath, the street which had witnessed the deliberate arrival of Albertine with the lady in grey. All these images \u2014 escaping from a life of falsehood and misconduct such as I had never conceived \u2014 my suffering had immediately altered in their very substance, I did not behold them in the light that illuminates earthly spectacles, they were a fragment of another world, of an unknown and accursed planet, a glimpse of Hell. My Hell was all that Balbec, all those neighbouring villages from which, according to Aim\u00e9\u2018s letter, she frequently collected girls younger than herself whom she took to the baths. That mystery which I had long ago imagined in the country round Balbec and which had been dispelled after I had stayed there, which I had then hoped to grasp again when I knew Albertine because, when I saw her pass me on the beach, when I was mad enough to desire that she might not be virtuous, I thought that she must be its incarnation, how fearfully now everything that related to Balbec was impregnated with it. The names of those stations, Toutainville, Epreville, Parville, grown so familiar, so soothing, when I heard them shouted at night as I returned from the Verdurins\u2019, now that I thought how Albertine had been staying at the last, had gone from there to the second, must often have ridden on her bicycle to the first, they aroused in me an anxiety more cruel than on the first occasion, when I beheld the places with such misgivings, before arriving at a Balbec which I did not yet know. It is one of the faculties of jealousy to reveal to us the extent to which the reality of external facts and the sentiments of the heart are an unknown element which lends itself to endless suppositions. We suppose that we know exactly what things are and what people think, for the simple reason that we do not care about them. But as soon as we feel the desire to know, which the jealous man feels, then it becomes a dizzy kaleidoscope in which we can no longer make out anything. Had Albertine been unfaithful to me? With whom? In what house? Upon what day? The day on which she had said this or that to me? When I remembered that I had in the course of it said this or that? I could not tell. Nor did I know what were her sentiments towards myself, whether they were inspired by financial interest, by affection. And all of a sudden I remembered some trivial incident, for instance that Albertine had wished to go to Saint-Mars le V\u00eatu, saying that the name interested her, and perhaps simply because she had made the acquaintance of some peasant girl who lived there. But it was nothing that Aim\u00e9 should have found out all this for me from the woman at the baths, since Albertine must remain eternally unaware that he had informed me, the need to know having always been exceeded, in my love for Albertine, by the need to shew her that I knew; for this abolished between us the partition of different illusions, without having ever had the result of making her love me more, far from it. And now, after she was dead, the second of these needs had been amalgamated with the effect of the first: I tried to picture to myself the conversation in which I would have informed her of what I had learned, as vividly as the conversation in which I would have asked her to tell me what I did not know; that is to say, to see her by my side, to hear her answering me kindly, to see her cheeks become plump again, her eyes shed their malice and assume an air of melancholy; that is to say, to love her still and to forget the fury of my jealousy in the despair of my loneliness. The painful mystery of this impossibility of ever making her know what I had learned and of establishing our relations upon the truth of what I had only just discovered (and would not have been able, perhaps, to discover, but for the fact of her death) substituted its sadness for the more painful mystery of her conduct. What? To have so keenly desired that Albertine should know that I had heard the story of the baths, Albertine who no longer existed! This again was one of the consequences of our utter inability, when we have to consider the matter of death, to picture to ourselves anything but life. Albertine no longer existed. But to me she was the person who had concealed from me that she had assignations with women at Balbec, who imagined that she had succeeded in keeping me in ignorance of them. When we try to consider what happens to us after our own death, is it not still our living self which by mistake we project before us? And is it much more absurd, when all is said, to regret that a woman who no longer exists is unaware that we have learned what she was doing six years ago than to desire that of ourselves, who will be dead, the public shall still speak with approval a century hence? If there is more real foundation in the latter than in the former case, the regrets of my retrospective jealousy proceeded none the less from the same optical error as in other men the desire for posthumous fame. And yet this impression of all the solemn finality that there was in my separation from Albertine, if it had been substituted for a moment for my idea of her misdeeds, only aggravated them by bestowing upon them an irremediable character\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I saw myself astray in life as upon an endless beach where I was alone and, in whatever direction I might turn, would never meet her. Fortunately, I found most appropriately in my memory \u2014 as there are always all sorts of things, some noxious, others salutary in that heap from which individual impressions come to light only one by one \u2014 I discovered, as a craftsman discovers the material that can serve for what he wishes to make, a speech of my grandmother\u2019s. She had said to me, with reference to an improbable story which the bath-woman had told Mme. de Villeparisis: \u201cShe is a woman who must suffer from a disease of mendacity.\u201d This memory was a great comfort to me. What importance could the story have that the woman had told Aim\u00e9? Especially as, after all, she had seen nothing. A girl can come and take baths with her friends without having any evil intention. Perhaps for her own glorification the woman had exaggerated the amount of the gratuity. I had indeed heard Fran\u00e7oise maintain once that my aunt L\u00e9onie had said in her hearing that she had \u2018a million a month to spend,\u2019 which was utter nonsense; another time that she had seen my aunt L\u00e9onie give Eulalie four thousand-franc notes, whereas a fifty-franc note folded in four seemed to me scarcely probable. And so I sought \u2014 and, in course of time, managed \u2014 to rid myself of the painful certainty which I had taken such trouble to acquire, tossed to and fro as I still was between the desire to know and the fear of suffering. Then my affection might revive afresh, but, simultaneously with it, a sorrow at being parted from Albertine, during the course of which I was perhaps even more wretched than in the recent hours when it had been jealousy that tormented me. But my jealousy was suddenly revived, when I thought of Balbec, because of the vision which at once reappeared (and which until then had never made me suffer and indeed appeared one of the most innocuous in my memory) of the dining-room at Balbec in the evening, with, on the other side of the windows, all that populace crowded together in the dusk, as before the luminous glass of an aquarium, producing a contact (of which I had never thought) in their conglomeration, between the fishermen and girls of the lower orders and the young ladies jealous of that splendour new to Balbec, that splendour from which, if not their means, at any rate avarice and tradition debarred their parents, young ladies among whom there had certainly been almost every evening Albertine whom I did not then know and who doubtless used to accost some little girl whom she would meet a few minutes later in the dark, upon the sands, or else in a deserted bathing hut at the foot of the cliff. Then it was my sorrow that revived, I had just heard like a sentence of banishment the sound of the lift which, instead of stopping at my floor, went on higher. And yet the only person from whom I could have hoped for a visit would never come again, she was dead. And in spite of this, when the lift did stop at my floor, my heart throbbed, for an instant I said to myself: \u201cIf, after all, it was only a dream! It is perhaps she, she is going to ring the bell, she has come back, Fran\u00e7oise will come in and say with more alarm than anger \u2014 for she is even more superstitious than vindictive, and would be less afraid of the living girl than of what she will perhaps take for a ghost \u2014\u2018Monsieur will never guess who is here.\u2019\u201d I tried not to think of anything, to take up a newspaper. But I found it impossible to read the articles written by men who felt no real grief. Of a trivial song, one of them said: \u201cIt moves one to tears,\u201d whereas I myself would have listened to it with joy had Albertine been alive. Another, albeit a great writer, because he had been greeted with cheers when he alighted from a train, said that he had received \u2018an unforgettable welcome,\u2019 whereas I, if it had been I who received that welcome, would not have given it even a moment\u2019s thought. And a third assured his readers that, but for its tiresome politics, life in Paris would be \u2018altogether delightful\u2019 whereas I knew well that even without politics that life could be nothing but atrocious to me, and would have seemed to me delightful, even with its politics, could I have found Albertine again. The sporting correspondent said (we were in the month of May): \u201cThis season of the year is positively painful, let us say rather disastrous, to the true sportsman, for there is nothing, absolutely nothing in the way of game,\u201d and the art critic said of the Salon: \u201cIn the face of this method of arranging an exhibition we are overwhelmed by an immense discouragement, by an infinite regret. . . . \u201d If the force of the regret that I was feeling made me regard as untruthful and colourless the expressions of men who had no true happiness or sorrow in their lives, on the other hand the most insignificant lines which could, however, remotely, attach themselves either to Normandy, or to Touraine, or to hydropathic establishments, or to L\u00e9a, or to the Princesse de Guermantes, or to love, or to absence, or to infidelity, at once set before my eyes, without my having the time to turn them away from it, the image of Albertine, and my tears started afresh. Besides, in the ordinary course, I could never read these newspapers, for the mere act of opening one of them reminded me at once that I used to open them when Albertine was alive, and that she was alive no longer; I let them drop without having the strength to unfold their pages. Each impression called up an impression that was identical but marred, because there had been cut out of it Albertine\u2019s existence, so that I had never the courage to live to the end these mutilated minutes. Indeed, when, little by little, Albertine ceased to be present in my thoughts and all-powerful over my heart, I was stabbed at once if I had occasion, as in the time when she was there, to go into her room, to grope for the light, to sit down by the pianola. Divided among a number of little household gods, she dwelt for a long time in the flame of the candle, the door-bell, the back of a chair, and other domains more immaterial such as a night of insomnia or the emotion that was caused me by the first visit of a woman who had attracted me. In spite of this the few sentences which I read in the course of a day or which my mind recalled that I had read, often aroused in me a cruel jealousy. To do this, they required not so much to supply me with a valid argument in favour of the immorality of women as to revive an old impression connected with the life of Albertine. Transported then to a forgotten moment, the force of which my habit of thinking of it had not dulled, and in which Albertine was still alive, her misdeeds became more immediate, more painful, more agonising. Then I asked myself whether I could be certain that the bath-woman\u2019s revelations were false. A good way of finding out the truth would be to send Aim\u00e9 to Touraine, to spend a few days in the neighbourhood of Mme. Bontemps\u2019s villa. If Albertine enjoyed the pleasures which one woman takes with others, if it was in order not to be deprived of them any longer that she had left me, she must, as soon as she was free, have sought to indulge in them and have succeeded, in a district which she knew and to which she would not have chosen to retire had she not expected to find greater facilities there than in my house. No doubt there was nothing extraordinary in the fact that Albertine\u2019s death had so little altered my preoccupations. When our mistress is alive, a great part of the thoughts which form what we call our loves come to us during the hours when she is not by our side. Thus we acquire the habit of having as the object of our meditation an absent person, and one who, even if she remains absent for a few hours only, during those hours is no more than a memory. And so death does not make any great difference. When Aim\u00e9 returned, I asked him to go down to Ch\u00e2tellerault, and thus not only by my thoughts, my sorrows, the emotion caused me by a name connected, however remotely, with a certain person, but even more by all my actions, by the inquiries that I undertook, by the use that I made of my money, all of which was devoted to the discovery of Albertine\u2019s actions, I may say that throughout this year my life remained filled with love, with a true bond of affection. And she who was its object was a corpse. We say at times that something may survive of a man after his death, if the man was an artist and took a certain amount of pains with his work. It is perhaps in the same way that a sort of cutting taken from one person and grafted on the heart of another continues to carry on its existence, even when the person from whom it had been detached has perished. Aim\u00e9 established himself in quarters close to Mme. Bontemps\u2019s villa; he made the acquaintance of a maidservant, of a jobmaster from whom Albertine had often hired a carriage by the day. These people had noticed nothing. In a second letter, Aim\u00e9 informed me that he had learned from a young laundress in the town that Albertine had a peculiar way of gripping her arm when she brought back the clean linen. \u201cBut,\u201d she said, \u201cthe young lady never did anything more.\u201d I sent Aim\u00e9 the money that paid for his journey, that paid for the harm which he had done me by his letter, and at the same time I was making an effort to discount it by telling myself that this was a familiarity which gave no proof of any vicious desire when I received a telegram from Aim\u00e9: \u201cHave learned most interesting things have abundant proofs letter follows.\u201d On the following day came a letter the envelope of which was enough to make me tremble; I had guessed that it came from Aim\u00e9, for everyone, even the humblest of us, has under his control those little familiar spirits at once living and couched in a sort of trance upon the paper, the characters of his handwriting which he alone possesses. \u201cAt first the young laundress refused to tell me anything, she assured me that Mlle. Albertine had never done anything more than pinch her arm. But to get her to talk, I took her out to dinner, I made her drink. Then she told me that Mlle. Albertine used often to meet her on the bank of the Loire, when she went to bathe, that Mlle. Albertine who was in the habit of getting up very early to go and bathe was in the habit of meeting her by the water\u2019s edge, at a spot where the trees are so thick that nobody can see you, and besides there is nobody who can see you at that hour in the morning. Then the young laundress brought her friends and they bathed and afterwards, as it was already very hot down here and the sun scorched you even through the trees, they used to lie about on the grass getting dry and playing and caressing each other. The young laundress confessed to me that she loved to amuse herself with her young friends and that seeing Mlle. Albertine was always wriggling against her in her wrapper she made her take it off and used to caress her with her tongue along the throat and arms, even on the soles of her feet which Mlle. Albertine stretched out to her. The laundress undressed too, and they played at pushing each other into the water; after that she told me nothing more, but being entirely at your orders and ready to do anything in the world to please you, I took the young laundress to bed with me. She asked me if I would like her to do to me what she used to do to Mlle. Albertine when she took off her bathing-dress. And she said to me: \u2018If you could have seen how she used to quiver, that young lady, she said to me: (oh, it\u2019s just heavenly) and she got so excited that she could not keep from biting me.\u2019 I could still see the marks on the girl\u2019s arms. And I can understand Mlle. Albertine\u2019s pleasure, for the girl is really a very good performer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had indeed suffered at Balbec when Albertine told me of her friendship with Mlle. Vinteuil. But Albertine was there to comfort me. Afterwards when, by my excessive curiosity as to her actions, I had succeeded in making Albertine leave me, when Fran\u00e7oise informed me that she was no longer in the house and I found myself alone, I had suffered more keenly still. But at least the Albertine whom I had loved remained in my heart. Now, in her place \u2014 to punish me for having pushed farther a curiosity to which, contrary to what I had supposed, death had not put an end \u2014 what I found was a different girl, heaping up lies and deceits one upon another, in the place where the former had so sweetly reassured me by swearing that she had never tasted those pleasures which, in the intoxication of her recaptured liberty, she had gone down to enjoy to the point of swooning, of biting that young laundress whom she used to meet at sunrise on the bank of the Loire, and to whom she used to say: \u201cOh, it\u2019s just heavenly.\u201d A different Albertine, not only in the sense in which we understand the word different when it is used of other people. If people are different from what we have supposed, as this difference cannot affect us profoundly, as the pendulum of intuition cannot move outward with a greater oscillation than that of its inward movement, it is only in the superficial regions of the people themselves that we place these differences. Formerly, when I learned that a woman loved other women, she did not for that reason seem to me a different woman, of a peculiar essence. But when it is a question of a woman with whom we are in love, in order to rid ourselves of the grief that we feel at the thought that such a thing is possible, we seek to find out not only what she has done, but what she felt while she was doing it, what idea she had in her mind of the thing that she was doing; then descending and advancing farther and farther, by the profundity of our grief we attain to the mystery, to the essence. I was pained internally, in my body, in my heart \u2014 far more than I should have been pained by the fear of losing my life \u2014 by this curiosity with which all the force of my intellect and of my subconscious self collaborated; and similarly it was into the core of Albertine\u2019s own being that I now projected everything that I learned about her. And the grief that had thus caused to penetrate to so great a depth in my own being the fact of Albertine\u2019s vice, was to render me later on a final service. Like the harm that I had done my grandmother, the harm that Albertine had done me was a last bond between her and myself which outlived memory even, for with the conservation of energy which belongs to everything that is physical, suffering has no need of the lessons of memory. Thus a man who has forgotten the charming night spent by moonlight in the woods, suffers still from the rheumatism which he then contracted. Those tastes which she had denied but which were hers, those tastes the discovery of which had come to me not by a cold process of reasoning but in the burning anguish that I had felt on reading the words: \u201cOh, it\u2019s just heavenly,\u201d a suffering which gave them a special quality of their own, those tastes were not merely added to the image of Albertine as is added to the hermit-crab the new shell which it drags after it, but, rather, like a salt which comes in contact with another salt, alters its colour, and, what is more, its nature. When the young laundress must have said to her young friends: \u201cJust fancy, I would never have believed it, well, the young lady is one too!\u201d to me it was not merely a vice hitherto unsuspected by them that they added to Albertine\u2019s person, but the discovery that she was another person, a person like themselves, speaking the same language, which, by making her the compatriot of other women, made her even more alien to myself, proved that what I had possessed of her, what I carried in my heart, was only quite a small part of her, and that the rest which was made so extensive by not being merely that thing so mysteriously important, an. individual desire, but being shared with others, she had always concealed from me, she had kept me aloof from it, as a woman might have concealed from me that she was a native of an enemy country and a spy; and would indeed have been acting even more treacherously than a spy, for a spy deceives us only as to her nationality, whereas Albertine had deceived me as to her profoundest humanity, the fact that she did not belong to the ordinary human race, but to an alien race which moves among it, conceals itself among it and never blends with it. I had as it happened seen two paintings by Elstir shewing against a leafy background nude women. In one of them, one of the girls is raising her foot as Albertine must have raised hers when she offered it to the laundress. With her other foot she is pushing into the water the other girl, who gaily resists, her hip bent, her foot barely submerged in the blue water. I remembered now that the raising of the thigh made the same swan\u2019s-neck curve with the angle of the knee that was made by the droop of Albertine\u2019s thigh when she was lying by my side on the bed, and I had often meant to tell her that she reminded me of those paintings. But I had refrained from doing so, in order not to awaken in her mind the image of nude female bodies. Now I saw her, side by side with the laundress and her friends, recomposing the group which I had so admired when I was seated among Albertine\u2019s friends at Balbec. And if I had been an enthusiast sensitive to absolute beauty, I should have recognised that Albertine re-composed it with a thousand times more beauty, now that its elements were the nude statues of goddesses like those which consummate sculptors scattered about the groves of Versailles or plunged in the fountains to be washed and polished by the caresses of their eddies. Now I saw her by the side of the laundress, girls by the water\u2019s edge, in their twofold nudity of marble maidens in the midst of a grove of vegetation and dipping into the water like bas-reliefs of Naiads. Remembering how Albertine looked as she lay upon my bed, I thought I could see her bent hip, I saw it, it was a swan\u2019s neck, it was seeking the lips of the other girl. Then I beheld no longer a leg, but the bold neck of a swan, like that which in a frenzied sketch seeks the lips of a Leda whom we see in all the palpitation peculiar to feminine pleasure, because there is nothing else but a swan, and she seems more alone, just as we discover upon the telephone the inflexions of a voice which we do not distinguish so long as it is not dissociated from a face in which we materialise its expression. In this sketch, the pleasure, instead of going to seek the face which inspires it and which is absent, replaced by a motionless swan, is concentrated in her who feels it. At certain moments the communication was cut between my heart and my memory. What Albertine had done with the laundress was indicated to me now only by almost algebraical abbreviations which no longer meant anything to me; but a hundred times in an hour the interrupted current was restored, and my heart was pitilessly scorched by a fire from hell, while I saw Albertine, raised to life by my jealousy, really alive, stiffen beneath the caresses of the young laundress, to whom she was saying: \u201cOh, it\u2019s just heavenly.\u201d As she was alive at the moment when she committed her misdeeds, that is to say at the moment at which I myself found myself placed, it was not sufficient to know of the misdeed, I wished her to know that I knew. And so, if at those moments I thought with regret that I should never see her again, this regret bore the stamp of my jealousy, and, very different from the lacerating regret of the moments in which I loved her, was only regret at not being able to say to her: \u201cYou thought that I should never know what you did after you left me, well, I know everything, the laundress on the bank of the Loire, you said to her: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just heavenly,\u2019 I have seen the bite.\u201d No doubt I said to myself: \u201cWhy torment myself? She who took her pleasure with the laundress no longer exists, and consequently was not a person whose actions retain any importance. She is not telling herself that I know. But no more is she telling herself that I do not know, since she tells herself nothing.\u201d But this line of reasoning convinced me less than the visual image of her pleasure which brought me back to the moment in which she had tasted it. What we feel is the only thing that exists for us, and we project it into the past, into the future, without letting ourselves be stopped by the fictitious barriers of death. If my regret that she was dead was subjected at such moments to the influence of my jealousy and assumed this so peculiar form, that influence extended over my dreams of occultism, of immortality, which were no more than an effort to realise what I desired. And so at those moments if I could have succeeded in evoking her by turning a table as Bergotte had at one time thought possible, or in meeting her in the other life as the Abb\u00e9 X thought, I would have wished to do so only in order to repeat to her: \u201cI know about the laundress. You said to her: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just heavenly,\u2019 I have seen the bite.\u201d What came to my rescue against this image of the laundress, was \u2014 certainly when it had endured for any while \u2014 the image itself, because we really know only what is novel, what suddenly introduces into our sensibility a change of tone which strikes us, the things for which habit has not yet substituted its colourless facsimiles. But it was, above all, this subdivision of Albertine in many fragments, in many Albertines, which was her sole mode of existence in me. Moments recurred in which she had merely been good, or intelligent, or serious, or even addicted to nothing but sport. And this subdivision, was it not after all proper that it should soothe me? For if it was not in itself anything real, if it depended upon the successive form of the hours in which it had appeared to me, a form which remained that of my memory as the curve of the projections of my magic lantern depended upon the curve of the coloured slides, did it not represent in its own manner a truth, a thoroughly objective truth too, to wit that each one of us is not a single person, but contains many persons who have not all the same moral value and that if a vicious Albertine had existed, it did not mean that there had not been others, she who enjoyed talking to me about Saint-Simon in her room, she who on the night when I had told her that we must part had said so sadly: \u201cThat pianola, this room, to think that I shall never see any of these things again\u201d and, when she saw the emotion which my lie had finally communicated to myself, had exclaimed with a sincere pity: \u201cOh, no, anything rather than make you unhappy, I promise that I will never try to see you again.\u201d Then I was no longer alone. I felt the wall that separated us vanish. At the moment in which the good Albertine had returned, I had found again the one person from whom I could demand the antidote to the sufferings which Albertine was causing me. True, I still wanted to speak to her about the story of the laundress, but it was no longer by way of a cruel triumph, and to shew her maliciously how much I knew. As I should have done had Albertine been alive, I asked her tenderly whether the tale about the laundress was true. She swore to me that it was not, that Aim\u00e9 was not truthful and that, wishing to appear to have earned the money which I had given him, he had not liked to return with nothing to shew, and had made the laundress tell him what he wished to hear. No doubt Albertine had been lying to me throughout. And yet in the flux and reflux of her contradictions, I felt that there had been a certain progression due to myself. That she had not indeed made me, at the outset, admissions (perhaps, it is true, involuntary in a phrase that escaped her lips) I would not have sworn. I no longer remembered. And besides she had such odd ways of naming certain things, that they might be interpreted in one sense or the other, but the feeling that she had had of my jealousy had led her afterwards to retract with horror what at first she had complacently admitted. Anyhow, Albertine had no need to tell me this. To be convinced of her innocence it was enough for me to embrace her, and I could do so now that the wall was down which parted us, like that impalpable and resisting wall which after a quarrel rises between two lovers and against which kisses would be shattered. No, she had no need to tell me anything. Whatever she might have done, whatever she might have wished to do, the poor child, there were sentiments in which, over the barrier that divided us, we could be united. If the story was true, and if Albertine had concealed her tastes from me, it was in order not to make me unhappy. I had the pleasure of hearing this Albertine say so. Besides, had I ever known any other? The two chief causes of error in our relations with another person are, having ourselves a good heart, or else being in love with the other person. We fall in love for a smile, a glance, a bare shoulder. That is enough; then, in the long hours of hope or sorrow, we fabricate a person, we compose a character. And when later on we see much of the beloved person, we can no longer, whatever the cruel reality that confronts us, strip off that good character, that nature of a woman who loves us, from the person who bestows that glance, bares that shoulder, than we can when she has grown old eliminate her youthful face from a person whom we have known since her girlhood. I called to mind the noble glance, kind and compassionate, of that Albertine, her plump cheeks, the coarse grain of her throat. It was the image of a dead woman, but, as this dead woman was alive, it was easy for me to do immediately what I should inevitably have done if she had been by my side in her living body (what I should do were I ever to meet her again in another life), I forgave her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The moments which I had spent with this Albertine were so precious to me that I would not have let any of them escape me. Now, at times, as we recover the remnants of a squandered fortune, I recaptured some of these which I had thought to be lost; as I tied a scarf behind my neck instead of in front, I remembered a drive of which I had never thought again, before which, in order that the cold air might not reach my throat, Albertine had arranged my scarf for me in this way after first kissing me. This simple drive, restored to my memory by so humble a gesture, gave me the same pleasure as the intimate objects once the property of a dead woman who was dear to us which her old servant brings to us and which are so precious to us; my grief found itself enriched by it, all the more so as I had never given another thought to the scarf in question\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And now Albertine, liberated once more, had resumed her flight; men, women followed her. She was alive in me. I became aware that this prolonged adoration of Albertine was like the ghost of the sentiment that I had felt for her, reproduced its various elements and obeyed the same laws as the sentimental reality which it reflected on the farther side of death. For I felt quite sure that if I could place some interval between my thoughts of Albertine, or if, on the other hand, I had allowed too long an interval to elapse, I should cease to love her; a clean cut would have made me unconcerned about her, as I was now about my grandmother. A period of any length spent without thinking of her would have broken in my memory the continuity which is the very principle of life, which however may be resumed after a certain interval of time. Had not this been the case with my love for Albertine when she was alive, a love which had been able to revive after a quite long interval during which I had never given her a thought? Well, my memory must have been obedient to the same laws, have been unable to endure longer intervals, for all that it did was, like an aurora borealis, to reflect after Albertine\u2019s death the sentiment that I had felt for her, it was like the phantom of my love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At other times my grief assumed so many forms that occasionally I no longer recognised it; I longed to be loved in earnest, decided to seek for a person who would live with me; this seemed to me to be the sign that I no longer loved Albertine, whereas it meant that I loved her still; for the need to be loved in earnest was, just as much as the desire to kiss Albertine\u2019s plump cheeks, merely a part of my regret. It was when I had forgotten her that I might feel it to be wiser, happier to live without love. And so my regret for Albertine, because it was it that aroused in me the need of a sister, made that need insatiable. And in proportion as my regret for Albertine grew fainter, the need of a sister, which was only an unconscious form of that regret, would become less imperious. And yet these two residues of my love did not proceed to shrink at an equal rate. There were hours in which I had made up my mind to marry, so completely had the former been eclipsed, the latter on the contrary retaining its full strength. And then, later on, my jealous memories having died away, suddenly at times a feeling welled up into my heart of affection for Albertine, and then, thinking of my own love affairs with other women, I told myself that she would have understood, would have shared them \u2014 and her vice became almost a reason for loving her. At times my jealousy revived in moments when I no longer remembered Albertine, albeit it was of her that I was jealous. I thought that I was jealous of Andr\u00e9e, of one of whose recent adventures I had just been informed. But Andr\u00e9e was to me merely a substitute, a bypath, a conduit which brought me indirectly to Albertine. So it is that in our dreams we give a different face, a different name to a person as to whose underlying identity we are not mistaken. When all was said, notwithstanding the flux and reflux which upset in these particular instances the general law, the sentiments that Albertine had left with me were more difficult to extinguish than the memory of their original cause. Not only the sentiments, but the sensations. Different in this respect from Swann who, when he had begun to cease to love Odette, had not even been able to recreate in himself the sensation of his love, I felt myself still reliving a past which was no longer anything more than the history of another person; my ego in a sense cloven in twain, while its upper extremity was already hard and frigid, burned still at its base whenever a spark made the old current pass through it, even after my mind had long ceased to conceive Albertine. And as no image of her accompanied the cruel palpitations, the tears that were brought to my eyes by a cold wind blowing as at Balbec upon the apple trees that were already pink with blossom, I was led to ask myself whether the renewal of my grief was not due to entirely pathological causes and whether what I took to be the revival of a memory and the final period of a state of love was not rather the first stage of heart-disease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are in certain affections secondary accidents which the sufferer is too apt to confuse with the malady itself. When they cease, he is surprised to find himself nearer to recovery than he has supposed. Of this sort had been the suffering caused me \u2014 the complication brought about \u2014 by Aim\u00e9\u2018s letters with regard to the bathing establishment and the young laundress. But a healer of broken hearts, had such a person visited me, would have found that, in other respects, my grief itself was on the way to recovery. No doubt in myself, since I was a man, one of those amphibious creatures who are plunged simultaneously in the past and in the reality of the moment, there still existed a contradiction between the living memory of Albertine and my consciousness of her death. But this contradiction was so to speak the opposite of what it had been before. The idea that Albertine was dead, this idea which at first used to contest so furiously with the idea that she was alive that I was obliged to run away from it as children run away from a breaking wave, this idea of her death, by the very force of its incessant onslaught, had ended by capturing the place in my mind that, a short while ago, was still occupied by the idea of her life. Without my being precisely aware of it, it was now this idea of Albertine\u2019s death \u2014 no longer the present memory of her life \u2014 that formed the chief subject of my unconscious musings, with the result that if I interrupted them suddenly to reflect upon myself, what surprised me was not, as in earlier days, that Albertine so living in myself could be no longer existent upon the earth, could be dead, but that Albertine, who no longer existed upon the earth, who was dead, should have remained so living in myself. Built up by the contiguity of the memories that followed one another, the black tunnel, in which my thoughts had been straying so long that they had even ceased to be aware of it, was suddenly broken by an interval of sunlight, allowing me to see in the distance a blue and smiling universe in which Albertine was no more than a memory, unimportant and full of charm. Is it this, I asked myself, that is the true Albertine, or is it indeed the person who, in the darkness through which I have so long been rolling, seemed to me the sole reality? The person that I had been so short a time ago, who lived only in the perpetual expectation of the moment when Albertine would come in to bid him good night and to kiss him, a sort of multiplication of myself made this person appear to me as no longer anything more than a feeble part, already half-detached from myself, and like a fading flower I felt the rejuvenating refreshment of an exfoliation. However, these brief illuminations succeeded perhaps only in making me more conscious of my love for Albertine, as happens with every idea that is too constant and has need of opposition to make it affirm itself. People who were alive during the war of 1870, for instance, say that the idea of war ended by seeming to them natural, not because they were not thinking sufficiently of the war, but because they could think of nothing else. And in order to understand how strange and important a fact war is, it was necessary that, some other thing tearing them from their permanent obsession, they should forget for a moment that war was being waged, should find themselves once again as they had been in a state of peace, until all of a sudden upon the momentary blank there stood out at length distinct the monstrous reality which they had long ceased to see, since there had been nothing else visible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If, again, this withdrawal of my different impressions of Albertine had at least been carried out not in echelon but simultaneously, equally, by a general retirement, along the whole line of my memory, my impressions of her infidelities retiring at the same time as those of her kindness, oblivion would have brought me solace. It was not so. As upon a beach where the tide recedes unevenly, I would be assailed by the rush of one of my suspicions when the image of her tender presence had already withdrawn too far from me to be able to bring me its remedy. As for the infidelities, they had made me suffer, because, however remote the year in which they had occurred, to me they were not remote; but I suffered from them less when they became remote, that is to say when I pictured them to myself less vividly, for the remoteness of a thing is in proportion rather to the visual power of the memory that is looking at it than to the real interval of the intervening days, like the memory of last night\u2019s dream which may seem to us more distant in its vagueness and obliteration than an event which is many years old. But albeit the idea of Albertine\u2019s death made headway in me, the reflux of the sensation that she was alive, if it did not arrest that progress, obstructed it nevertheless and prevented its being regular. And I realise now that during this period (doubtless because of my having forgotten the hours in which she had been cloistered in my house, hours which, by dint of relieving me from any pain at misdeeds which seemed to me almost unimportant because I knew that she was not committing them, had become almost tantamount to so many proofs of her innocence), I underwent the martyrdom of living in the constant company of an idea quite as novel as the idea that Albertine was dead (previously I had always started from the idea that she was alive), with an idea which I should have supposed it to be equally impossible to endure and which, without my noticing it, was gradually forming the basis of my consciousness, was substituting itself for the idea that Albertine was innocent: the idea that she was guilty. When I believed that I was doubting her, I was on the contrary believing in her; similarly I took as the starting point of my other ideas the certainty \u2014 often proved false as the contrary idea had been \u2014 the certainty of her guilt, while I continued to imagine that I still felt doubts. I must have suffered intensely during this period, but I realise that it was inevitable. We are healed of a suffering only by experiencing it to the full. By protecting Albertine from any contact with the outer world, by forging the illusion that she was innocent, just as later on when I adopted as the basis of my reasoning the thought that she was alive, I was merely postponing the hour of my recovery, because I was postponing the long hours that must elapse as a preliminary to the end of the necessary sufferings. Now with regard to these ideas of Albertine\u2019s guilt, habit, were it to come into play, would do so according to the same laws that I had already experienced in the course of my life. Just as the name Guermantes had lost the significance and the charm of a road bordered with flowers in purple and ruddy clusters and of the window of Gilbert the Bad, Albertine\u2019s presence, that of the blue undulations of the sea, the names of Swann, of the lift-boy, of the Princesse de Guermantes and ever so many others had lost all that they had signified for me \u2014 that charm and that significance leaving in me a mere word which they considered important enough to live by itself, as a man who has come to set a subordinate to work gives him his instructions and after a few weeks withdraws \u2014 similarly the painful knowledge of Albertine\u2019s guilt would be expelled from me by habit. Moreover, between now and then, as in the course of an attack launched from both flanks at once, in this action by habit two allies would mutually lend a hand. It was because this idea of Albertine\u2019s guilt would become for me an idea more probable, more habitual, that it would become less painful. But on the other hand, because it would be less painful, the objections raised to my certainty of her guilt, which were inspired in my mind only by my desire not to suffer too acutely, would collapse one by one, and as each action precipitates the next, I should pass quickly enough from the certainty of Albertine\u2019s innocence to the certainty of her guilt. It was essential that I should live with the idea of Albertine\u2019s death, with the idea of her misdeeds, in order that these ideas might become habitual, that is to say that I might be able to forget these ideas and in the end to forget Albertine herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had not yet reached this stage. At one time it was my memory made more clear by some intellectual excitement \u2014 such as reading a book \u2014 which revived my grief, at other times it was on the contrary my grief \u2014 when it was aroused, for instance, by the anguish of a spell of stormy weather \u2014 which raised higher, brought nearer to the light, some memory of our love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover these revivals of my love for Albertine might occur after an interval of indifference interspersed with other curiosities, as after the long interval that had dated from her refusal to let me kiss her at Balbec, during which I had thought far more about Mme. de Guermantes, about Andr\u00e9e, about Mme. de Stermaria; it had revived when I had begun again to see her frequently. But even now various preoccupations were able to bring about a separation \u2014 from a dead woman, this time \u2014 in which she left me more indifferent. And even later on when I loved her less, this remained nevertheless for me one of those desires of which we soon grow tired, but which resume their hold when we have allowed them to lie quiet for some time. I pursued one living woman, then another, then I returned to my dead. Often it was in the most obscure recesses of myself, when I could no longer form any clear idea of Albertine, that a name came by chance to stimulate painful reactions, which I supposed to be no longer possible, like those dying people whose brain is no longer capable of thought and who are made to contract their muscles by the prick of a needle. And, during long periods, these stimulations occurred to me so rarely that I was driven to seek for myself the occasions of a grief, of a crisis of jealousy, in an attempt to re-attach myself to the past, to remember her better. Since regret for a woman is only a recrudescence of love and remains subject to the same laws, the keenness of my regret was enhanced by the same causes which in Albertine\u2019s lifetime had increased my love for her and in the front rank of which had always appeared jealousy and grief. But as a rule these occasions \u2014 for an illness, a war, can always last far longer than the most prophetic wisdom has calculated \u2014 took me unawares and caused me such violent shocks that I thought far more of protecting myself against suffering than of appealing to them for a memory\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover a word did not even need to be connected, like \u2018Chaumont,\u2019 with some suspicion (even a syllable common to different names was sufficient for my memory \u2014 as for an electrician who is prepared to use any substance that is a good conductor \u2014 to restore the contact between Albertine and my heart) in order to reawaken that suspicion, to be the password, the triumphant \u2018Open, Sesame\u2019 unlocking the door of a past which one had ceased to take into account, because, having seen more than enough of it, strictly speaking one no longer possessed it; one had been shorn of it, had supposed that by this subtraction one\u2019s own personality had changed its form, like a geometrical figure which by the removal of an angle would lose one of its sides; certain phrases for instance in which there occurred the name of a street, of a road, where Albertine might have been, were sufficient to incarnate a potential, non-existent jealousy, in the quest of a body, a dwelling, some material location, some particular realisation. Often it was simply during my sleep that these \u2018repetitions,\u2019 these \u2018da capo\u2019 of our dreams which turn back in an instant many pages of our memory, many leaves of the calendar, brought me back, made me return to a painful but remote impression which had long since yielded its place to others but which now became present once more. As a rule, it was accompanied by a whole stage-setting, clumsy but appealing, which, giving me the illusion of reality, brought before my eyes, sounded in my ears what thenceforward dated from that night. Besides, in the history of a love-affair and of its struggles against oblivion, do not our dreams occupy an even larger place than our waking state, our dreams which take no account of the infinitesimal divisions of time, suppress transitions, oppose sharp contrasts, undo in an instant the web of consolation so slowly woven during the day, and contrive for us, by night, a meeting with her whom we would eventually have forgotten, provided always that we did not see her again. For whatever anyone may say, we can perfectly well have in a dream the impression that what is happening is real. This could be impossible only for reasons drawn from our experience which at that moment is hidden from us. With the result that this improbable life seems to us true. Sometimes, by a defect in the internal lighting which spoiled the success of the play, the appearance of my memories on the stage giving me the illusion of real life, I really believed that I had arranged to meet Albertine, that I was seeing her again, but then I found myself incapable of advancing to meet her, of uttering the words which I meant to say to her, to rekindle in order to see her the torch that had been quenched, impossibilities which were simply in my dream the immobility, the dumbness, the blindness of the sleeper \u2014 as suddenly one sees in the faulty projection of a magic lantern a huge shadow, which ought not to be visible, obliterate the figures on the slide, which is the shadow of the lantern itself, or that of the operator. At other times Albertine appeared in my dream, and proposed to leave me once again, without my being moved by her determination. This was because from my memory there had been able to filter into the darkness of my dream a warning ray of light which, lodged in Albertine, deprived her future actions, the departure of which she informed me, of any importance, this was the knowledge that she was dead. Often this memory that Albertine was dead was combined, without destroying it, with the sensation that she was alive. I conversed with her; while I was speaking, my grandmother came and went at the other end of the room. Part of her chin had crumbled away like a corroded marble, but I found nothing unusual in that. I told Albertine that I had various questions to ask her with regard to the bathing establishment at Balbec and to a certain laundress in Touraine, but I postponed them to another occasion since we had plenty of time and there was no longer any urgency. She assured me that she was not doing anything wrong and that she had merely, the day before, kissed Mlle. Vinteuil on the lips. \u201cWhat? Is she here?\u201d \u201cYes, in fact it is time for me to leave you, for I have to go and see her presently.\u201d And since, now that Albertine was dead, I no longer kept her a prisoner in my house as in the last months of her life, her visit to Mlle. Vinteuil disturbed me. I sought to prevent Albertine from seeing her. Albertine told me that she had done no more than kiss her, but she was evidently beginning to lie again as in the days when she used to deny everything. Presently she would not be content, probably, with kissing Mlle. Vinteuil. No doubt from a certain point of view I was wrong to let myself be disturbed like this, since, according to what we are told, the dead can feel, can do nothing. People say so, but this did not explain the fact that my grandmother, who was dead, had continued nevertheless to live for many years, and at that moment was passing to and fro in my room. And no doubt, once I was awake, this idea of a dead woman who continued to live ought to have become as impossible for me to understand as it is to explain. But I had already formed it so many times in the course of those transient periods of insanity which are our dreams, that I had become in time familiar with it; our memory of dreams may become lasting, if they repeat themselves sufficiently often. And long after my dream had ended, I remained tormented by that kiss which Albertine had told me that she had bestowed in words which I thought that I could still hear. And indeed, they must have passed very close to my ear since it was I myself that had uttered them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All day long, I continued to converse with Albertine, I questioned her, I forgave her, I made up for my forgetfulness of the things which I had always meant to say to her during her life. And all of a sudden I was startled by the thought that to the creature invoked by memory to whom all these remarks were addressed, no reality any longer corresponded, that death had destroyed the various parts of the face to which the continual urge of the will to live, now abolished, had alone given the unity of a person. At other times, without my having dreamed, as soon as I awoke, I felt that the wind had changed in me; it was blowing coldly and steadily from another direction, issuing from the remotest past, bringing back to me the sound of a clock striking far-off hours, of the whistle of departing trains which I did not ordinarily hear. One day I tried to interest myself in a book, a novel by Bergotte, of which I had been especially fond. Its congenial characters appealed to me strongly, and very soon, reconquered by the charm of the book, I began to hope, as for a personal pleasure, that the wicked woman might be punished; my eyes grew moist when the happiness of the young lovers was assured. \u201cBut then,\u201d I exclaimed in despair, \u201cfrom my attaching so much importance to what Albertine may have done, I must conclude that her personality is something real which cannot be destroyed, that I shall find her one day in her own likeness in heaven, if I invoke with so many prayers, await with such impatience, learn with such floods of tears the success of a person who has never existed save in Bergotte\u2019s imagination, whom I have never seen, whose appearance I am at liberty to imagine as I please!\u201d Besides, in this novel, there were seductive girls, amorous correspondences, deserted paths in which lovers meet, this reminded me that one may love clandestinely, it revived my jealousy, as though Albertine had still been able to stroll along deserted paths. And there was also the incident of a man who meets after fifty years a woman whom he loved in her youth, does not recognise her, is bored in her company. And this reminded me that love does not last for ever and crushed me as though I were destined to be parted from Albertine and to meet her again with indifference in my old age. If I caught sight of a map of France, my timorous eyes took care not to come upon Touraine so that I might not be jealous, nor, so that I might not be miserable, upon Normandy where the map marked at least Balbec and Donci\u00e8res, between which I placed all those roads that we had traversed so many times together. In the midst of other names of towns or villages of France, names which were merely visible or audible, the name of Tours for instance seemed to be differently composed, no longer of immaterial images, but of venomous substances which acted in an immediate fashion upon my heart whose beatings they quickened and made painful. And if this force extended to certain names, which it had made so different from the rest, how when I remained more shut up in myself, when I confined myself to Albertine herself, could I be astonished that, emanating from a girl who was probably just like any other girl, this force which I found irresistible, and to produce which any other woman might have served, had been the result of a confusion and of the bringing in contact of dreams, desires, habits, affections, with the requisite interference of alternate pains and pleasures? And this continued after her death, memory being sufficient to carry on the real life, which is mental. I recalled Albertine alighting from a railway-carriage and telling me that she wanted to go to Saint-Mars le V\u00eatu, and I saw her again also with her \u2018polo\u2019 pulled down over her cheeks, I found once more possibilities of pleasure, towards which I sprang saying to myself: \u201cWe might have gone on together to Incarville, to Donci\u00e8res.\u201d There was no watering-place in the neighbourhood of Balbec in which I did not see her, with the result that that country, like a mythological land which had been preserved, restored to me, living and cruel, the most ancient, the most charming legends, those that had been most obliterated by the sequel of my love. Oh! what anguish were I ever to have to lie down again upon that bed at Balbec around whose brass frame, as around an immovable pivot, a fixed bar, my life had moved, had evolved, bringing successively into its compass gay conversations with my grandmother, the nightmare of her death, Albertine\u2019s soothing caresses, the discovery of her vice, and now a new life in which, looking at the glazed bookcases upon which the sea was reflected, I knew that Albertine would never come into the room again! Was it not, that Balbec hotel, like the sole indoor set of a provincial theatre, in which for years past the most diverse plays have been performed, which has served for a comedy, for one tragedy, for another, for a purely poetical drama, that hotel which already receded quite far into my past? The fact that this part alone remained always the same, with its walls, its bookcases, its glass panes, through the course of fresh epochs in my life, made me more conscious that, in the total, it was the rest, it was myself that had changed, and gave me thus that impression that the mysteries of life, of love, of death, in which children imagine in their optimism that they have no share, are not set apart, but that we perceive with a dolorous pride that they have embodied themselves in the course of years in our own life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I tried at times to take an interest in the newspapers. But I found the act of reading them repellent, and moreover it was not without danger to myself. The fact is that from each of our ideas, as from a clearing in a forest, so many roads branch in different directions that at the moment when I least expected it I found myself faced by a fresh memory. The title of Faur\u00e9\u2018s melody le Secret had led me to the Duc de Broglie\u2019s Secret du Roi, the name Broglie to that of Chaumont, or else the words \u2018Good Friday\u2019 had made me think of Golgotha, Golgotha of the etymology of the word which is, it seems, the equivalent of Calvus Mons, Chaumont. But, whatever the path by which I might have arrived at Chaumont, at that moment I received so violent a shock that I could think only of how to guard myself against pain. Some moments after the shock, my intelligence, which like the sound of thunder travels less rapidly, taught me the reason. Chaumont had made me think of the Buttes-Chaumont to which Mme. Bontemps had told me that Andr\u00e9e used often to go with Albertine, whereas Albertine had told me that she had never seen the Buttes-Chaumont. After a certain age our memories are so intertwined with one another that the thing of which we are thinking, the book that we are reading are of scarcely any importance. We have put something of ourself everywhere, everything is fertile, everything is dangerous, and we can make discoveries no less precious than in Pascal\u2019s Pens\u00e9es in an advertisement of soap\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No doubt an incident such as this of the Buttes-Chaumont which at the time had appeared to me futile was in itself far less serious, far less decisive evidence against Albertine than the story of the bath-woman or the laundress. But, for one thing, a memory which comes to us by chance finds in is an intact capacity for imagining, that is to say in this case for suffering, which we have partly exhausted when it is on the contrary ourselves that deliberately applied our mind to recreating a memory. And to these latter memories (those that concerned the bath-woman and the laundress) ever present albeit obscured in my consciousness, like the furniture placed in the semi-darkness of a gallery which, without being able to see them, we avoid as we pass, I had grown accustomed. It was, on the contrary, a long time since I had given a thought to the Buttes-Chaumont, or, to take another instance, to Albertine\u2019s scrutiny of the mirror in the casino at Balbec, or to her unexplained delay on the evening when I had waited so long for her after the Guermantes party, to any of those parts of her life which remained outside my heart and which I would have liked to know in order that they might become assimilated, annexed to it, become joined with the more pleasant memories which formed in it an Albertine internal and genuinely possessed. When I raised a corner of the heavy curtain of habit (the stupefying habit which during the whole course of our life conceals from us almost the whole universe, and in the dead of night, without changing the label, substitutes for the most dangerous or intoxicating poisons of life some kind of anodyne which does not procure any delight), such a memory would come back to me as on the day of the incident itself with that fresh and piercing novelty of a recurring season, of a change in the routine of our hours, which, in the realm of pleasures also, if we get into a carriage on the first fine day in spring, or leave the house at sunrise, makes us observe our own insignificant actions with a lucid exaltation which makes that intense minute worth more than the sum-total of the preceding days. I found myself once more coming away from the party at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s and awaiting the coming of Albertine. Days in the past cover up little by little those that preceded them and are themselves buried beneath those that follow them. But each past day has remained deposited in us, as, in a vast library in which there are older books, a volume which, doubtless, nobody will ever ask to see. And yet should this day from the past, traversing the lucidity of the subsequent epochs, rise to the surface and spread itself over us whom it entirely covers, then for a moment the names resume their former meaning, people their former aspect, we ourselves our state of mind at the time, and we feel, with a vague suffering which however is endurable and will not last for long, the problems which have long ago become insoluble and which caused us such anguish at the time. Our ego is composed of the superimposition of our successive states. But this superimposition is not unalterable like the stratification of a mountain. Incessant upheavals raise to the surface ancient deposits. I found myself as I had been after the party at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s, awaiting the coming of Albertine. What had she been doing that evening? Had she been unfaithful to me? With whom? Aim\u00e9\u2018s revelations, even if I accepted them, in no way diminished for me the anxious, despairing interest of this unexpected question, as though each different Albertine, each fresh memory, set a special problem of jealousy, to which the solutions of the other problems could not apply. But I would have liked to know not only with what woman she had spent that evening, but what special pleasure the action represented to her, what was occurring in that moment in herself. Sometimes, at Balbec, Fran\u00e7oise had gone to fetch her, had told me that she had found her leaning out of her window, with an uneasy, questing air, as though she were expecting somebody. Supposing that I learned that the girl whom she was awaiting was Andr\u00e9e, what was the state of mind in which Albertine awaited her, that state of mind concealed behind the uneasy, questing gaze? That tendency, what importance did it have for Albertine? How large a place did it occupy in her thoughts? Alas, when I recalled my own agitation, whenever I had caught sight of a girl who attracted me, sometimes when I had merely heard her mentioned without having seen her, my anxiety to look my best, to enjoy every advantage, my cold sweats, I had only, in order to torture myself, to imagine the same voluptuous emotion in Albertine. And already it was sufficient to torture me, if I said to myself that, compared with this other thing, her serious conversations with me about Stendhal and Victor Hugo must have had very little weight with her, if I felt her heart attracted towards other people, detach itself from mine, incarnate itself elsewhere. But even the importance which this desire must have had for her and the reserve with which she surrounded it could not reveal to me what, qualitatively, it had been, still less how she qualified it when she spoke of it to herself. In bodily suffering, at least we do not have ourselves to choose our pain. The malady decides it and imposes it on us. But in jealousy we have to some extent to make trial of sufferings of every sort and degree, before we arrive at the one which seems appropriate. And what could be more difficult, when it is a question of a suffering such as that of feeling that she whom we loved is finding pleasure with persons different from ourselves who give her sensations which we are not capable of giving her, or who at least by their configuration, their aspect, their ways, represent to her anything but ourselves. Ah! if only Albertine had fallen in love with Saint-Loup! How much less, it seemed to me, I should have suffered! It is true that we are unaware of the peculiar sensibility of each of our fellow-creatures, but as a rule we do not even know that we are unaware of it, for this sensibility of other people leaves us cold. So far as Albertine was concerned, my misery or happiness would have depended upon the nature of this sensibility; I knew well enough that it was unknown to me, and the fact that it was unknown to me was already a grief \u2014 the unknown desires and pleasures that Albertine felt, once I was under the illusion that I beheld them, when, some time after Albertine\u2019s death, Andr\u00e9e came to see me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the first time she seemed to me beautiful, I said to myself that her almost woolly hair, her dark, shadowed eyes, were doubtless what Albertine had so dearly loved, the materialisation before my eyes of what she used to take with her in her amorous dreams, of what she beheld with the prophetic eyes of desire on the day when she had so suddenly decided to leave Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like a strange, dark flower that was brought to me from beyond the grave, from the innermost being of a person in whom I had been unable to discover it, I seemed to see before me, the unlooked-for exhumation of a priceless relic, the incarnate desire of Albertine which Andr\u00e9e was to me, as Venus was the desire of Jove. Andr\u00e9e regretted Albertine, but I felt at once that she did not miss her. Forcibly removed from her friend by death, she seemed to have easily taken her part in a final separation which I would not have dared to ask of her while Albertine was alive, so afraid would I have been of not succeeding in obtaining Andr\u00e9e\u2019s consent. She seemed on the contrary to accept without difficulty this renunciation, but precisely at the moment when it could no longer be of any advantage to me. Andr\u00e9e abandoned Albertine to me, but dead, and when she had lost for me not only her life but retrospectively a little of her reality, since I saw that she was not indispensable, unique to Andr\u00e9e who had been able to replace her with other girls\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While Albertine was alive, I would not have dared to ask Andr\u00e9e to take me into her confidence as to the nature of their friendship both mutually and with Mlle. Vinteuil\u2019s friend, since I was never absolutely certain that Andr\u00e9e did not repeat to Albertine everything that I said to her. But now such an inquiry, even if it must prove fruitless, would at least be unattended by danger. I spoke to Andr\u00e9e not in a questioning tone but as though I had known all the time, perhaps from Albertine, of the fondness that Andr\u00e9e herself had for women and of her own relations with Mlle. Vinteuil\u2019s friend. She admitted everything without the slightest reluctance, smiling as she spoke. From this avowal, I might derive the most painful consequences; first of all because Andr\u00e9e, so affectionate and coquettish with many of the young men at Balbec, would never have been suspected by anyone of practices which she made no attempt to deny, so that by analogy, when I discovered this novel Andr\u00e9e, I might think that Albertine would have confessed them with the same ease to anyone other than myself whom she felt to be jealous. But on the other hand, Andr\u00e9e having been Albertine\u2019s dearest friend, and the friend for whose sake she had probably returned in haste from Balbec, now that Andr\u00e9e was proved to have these tastes, the conclusion that was forced upon my mind was that Albertine and Andr\u00e9e had always indulged them together. Certainly, just as in a stranger\u2019s presence, we do not always dare to examine the gift that he has brought us, the wrapper of which we shall not unfasten until the donor has gone, so long as Andr\u00e9e was with me I did not retire into myself to examine the grief that she had brought me, which, I could feel, was already causing my bodily servants, my nerves, my heart, a keen disturbance which, out of good breeding, I pretended not to notice, speaking on the contrary with the utmost affability to the girl who was my guest without diverting my gaze to these internal incidents. It was especially painful to me to hear Andr\u00e9e say, speaking of Albertine: \u201cOh yes, she always loved going to the Chevreuse valley.\u201d To the vague and non-existent universe in which Albertine\u2019s excursions with Andr\u00e9e occurred, it seemed to me that the latter had, by a posterior and diabolical creation, added an accursed valley. I felt that Andr\u00e9e was going to tell me everything that she was in the habit of doing with Albertine, and, while I endeavoured from politeness, from force of habit, from self-esteem, perhaps from gratitude, to appear more and more affectionate, while the space that I had still been able to concede to Albertine\u2019s innocence became smaller and smaller, I seemed to perceive that, despite my efforts, I presented the paralysed aspect of an animal round which a steadily narrowing circle is slowly traced by the hypnotising bird of prey which makes no haste because it is sure of reaching when it chooses the victim that can no longer escape. I gazed at her nevertheless, and, with such liveliness, naturalness and assurance as a person can muster who is trying to make it appear that he is not afraid of being hypnotised by the other\u2019s stare, I said casually to Andr\u00e9e: \u201cI have never mentioned the subject to you for fear of offending you, but now that we both find a pleasure in talking about her, I may as well tell you that I found out long ago all about the things of that sort that you used to do with Albertine. And I can tell you something that you will be glad to hear although you know it already: Albertine adored you.\u201d I told Andr\u00e9e that it would be of great interest to me if she would allow me to see her, even if she simply confined herself to caresses which would not embarrass her unduly in my presence, performing such actions with those of Albertine\u2019s friends who shared her tastes, and I mentioned Rosemonde, Berthe, each of Albertine\u2019s friends, in the hope of finding out something. \u201cApart from the fact that not for anything in the world would I do the things you mention in your presence,\u201d Andr\u00e9e replied, \u201cI do not believe that any of the girls whom you have named have those tastes.\u201d Drawing closer in spite of myself to the monster that was attracting me, I answered: \u201cWhat! You are not going to expect me to believe that, of all your band, Albertine was the only one with whom you did that sort of thing!\u201d \u201cBut I have never done anything of the sort with Albertine.\u201d \u201cCome now, my dear Andr\u00e9e, why deny things which I have known for at least three years, I see no harm in them, far from it. Talking of such things, that evening when she was so anxious to go with you the next day to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, you may remember perhaps. . . . \u201d Before I had completed my sentence, I saw in Andr\u00e9e\u2019s eyes, which it sharpened to a pin-point like those stones which for that reason jewellers find it difficult to use, a fleeting, worried stare, like the heads of persons privileged to go behind the scenes who draw back the edge of the curtain before the play has begun and at once retire in order not to be seen. This uneasy stare vanished, everything had become quite normal, but I felt that anything which I might see hereafter would have been specially arranged for my benefit. At that moment I caught sight of myself in the mirror; I was struck by a certain resemblance between myself and Andr\u00e9e. If I had not long since ceased to shave my upper lip and had had but the faintest shadow of a moustache, this resemblance would have been almost complete. It was perhaps when she saw, at Balbec, my moustache which had scarcely begun to grow, that Albertine had suddenly felt that impatient, furious desire to return to Paris. \u201cBut I cannot, all the same, say things that are not true, for the simple reason that you see no harm in them. I swear to you that I never did anything with Albertine, and I am convinced that she detested that sort of thing. The people who told you were lying to you, probably with some ulterior motive,\u201d she said with a questioning, defiant air. \u201cOh, very well then, since you won\u2019t tell me,\u201d I replied. I preferred to appear to be unwilling to furnish a proof which I did not possess. And yet I uttered vaguely and at random the name of the Buttes-Chaumont. \u201cI may have gone to the Buttes-Chaumont with Albertine, but is it a place that has a particularly evil reputation?\u201d I asked her whether she could not mention the subject to Gis\u00e8le who had at one time been on intimate terms with Albertine. But Andr\u00e9e assured me that after the outrageous way in which Gis\u00e8le had behaved to her recently, asking a favour of her was the one thing that she must absolutely decline to do for me. \u201cIf you see her,\u201d she went on, \u201cdo not tell her what I have said to you about her, there is no use in making an enemy of her. She knows what I think of her, but I have always preferred to avoid having violent quarrels with her which only have to be patched up afterwards. And besides, she is a dangerous person. But you can understand that when one has read the letter which I had in my hands a week ago, and in which she lied with such absolute treachery, nothing, not even the noblest actions in the world, can wipe out the memory of such a thing.\u201d In short, if, albeit Andr\u00e9e had those tastes to such an extent that she made no pretence of concealing them, and Albertine had felt for her that strong affection which she had undoubtedly felt, notwithstanding this Andr\u00e9e had never had any carnal relations with Albertine and had never been aware that Albertine had those tastes, this meant that Albertine did not have them, and had never enjoyed with anyone those relations which, rather than with anyone else, she would have enjoyed with Andr\u00e9e. And so when Andr\u00e9e had left me, I realised that so definite a statement had brought me peace of mind. But perhaps it had been dictated by a sense of the obligation, which Andr\u00e9e felt that she owed to the dead girl whose memory still survived in her, not to let me believe what Albertine had doubtless, while she was alive, begged her to deny\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Novelists sometimes pretend in an introduction that while travelling in a foreign country they have met somebody who has told them the story of a person\u2019s life. They then withdraw in favour of this casual acquaintance, and the story that he tells them is nothing more or less than their novel. Thus the life of Fabrice del Dongo was related to Stendhal by a Canon of Padua. How gladly would we, when we are in love, that is to say when another person\u2019s existence seems to us mysterious, find some such well-informed narrator! And undoubtedly he exists. Do we not ourselves frequently relate, without any trace of passion, the story of some woman or other, to one of our friends, or to a stranger, who has known nothing of her love-affairs and listens to us with keen interest? The person that I was when I spoke to Bloch of the Duchesse de Guermantes, of Mme. Swann, that person still existed, who could have spoken to me of Albertine, that person exists always . . . but we never come across him. It seemed to me that, if I had been able to find women who had known her, I should have learned everything of which I was unaware. And yet to strangers it must have seemed that nobody could have known so much of her life as myself. Did I even know her dearest friend, Andr\u00e9e? Thus it is that we suppose that the friend of a Minister must know the truth about some political affair or cannot be implicated in a scandal. Having tried and failed, the friend has found that whenever he discussed politics with the Minister the latter confined himself to generalisations and told him nothing more than what had already appeared in the newspapers, or that if he was in any trouble, his repeated attempts to secure the Minister\u2019s help have ended invariably in an: \u201cIt is not in my power\u201d against which the friend is himself powerless. I said to myself: \u201cIf I could have known such and such witnesses!\u201d from whom, if I had known them, I should probably have been unable to extract anything more than from Andr\u00e9e, herself the custodian of a secret which she refused to surrender. Differing in this respect also from Swann who, when he was no longer jealous, ceased to feel any curiosity as to what Odette might have done with Forcheville, even after my jealousy had subsided, the thought of making the acquaintance of Albertine\u2019s laundress, of the people in her neighbourhood, of reconstructing her life in it, her intrigues, this alone had any charm for me. And as desire always springs from a preliminary sense of value, as had happened to me in the past with Gilberte, with the Duchesse de Guermantes, it was, in the districts in which Albertine had lived in the past, the women of her class that I sought to know, and whose presence alone I could have desired. Even without my being able to learn anything from them, they were the only women towards whom I felt myself attracted, as being those whom Albertine had known or whom she might have known, women of her class or of the classes with which she liked to associate, in a word those women who had in my eyes the distinction of resembling her or of being of the type that had appealed to her. As I recalled thus either Albertine herself, or the type for which she had doubtless felt a preference, these women aroused in me an agonising feeling of jealousy or regret, which afterwards when my grief had been dulled changed into a curiosity not devoid of charm. And among them especially the women of the working class, on account of that life, so different from the life that I knew, which is theirs. No doubt it is only in our mind that we possess things, and we do not possess a picture because it hangs in our dining-room if we are incapable of understanding it, or a landscape because we live in front of it without even glancing at it. But still I had had in the past the illusion of recapturing Balbec, when in Paris Albertine came to see me and I held her in my arms. Similarly I obtained a contact, restricted and furtive as it might be, with Albertine\u2019s life, the atmosphere of workrooms, a conversation across a counter, the spirit of the slums, when I kissed a seamstress. Andr\u00e9e, these other women, all of them in relation to Albertine \u2014 as Albertine herself had been in relation to Balbec \u2014 were to be numbered among those substitutes for pleasures, replacing one another, in a gradual degradation, which enable us to dispense with the pleasure to which we can no longer attain, a holiday at Balbec, or the love of Albertine (as the act of going to the Louvre to look at a Titian which was originally in Venice consoles us for not being able to go there), for those pleasures which, separated one from another by indistinguishable gradations, convert our life into a series of concentric, contiguous, harmonic and graduated zones, encircling an initial desire which has set the tone, eliminated everything that does not combine with it and spread the dominant colour (as had, for instance, occurred to me also in the cases of the Duchesse de Guermantes and of Gilberte). Andr\u00e9e, these women, were to the desire, for the gratification of which I knew that it was hopeless, now, to pray, to have Albertine by my side, what one evening, before I knew Albertine save by sight, had been the many-faceted and refreshing lustre of a bunch of grapes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Associated now with the memory of my love, Albertine\u2019s physical and social attributes, in spite of which I had loved her, attracted my desire on the contrary towards what at one time it would least readily have chosen: dark girls of the lower middle class. Indeed what was beginning to a certain extent to revive in me was that immense desire which my love for Albertine had not been able to assuage, that immense desire to know life which I used to feel on the roads round Balbec, in the streets of Paris, that desire which had caused me so much suffering when, supposing it to exist in Albertine\u2019s heart also, I had sought to deprive her of the means of satisfying it with anyone but myself. Now that I was able to endure the thought of her desire, as that thought was at once aroused by my own desire, these two immense appetites coincided, I would have liked us to be able to indulge them together, I said to myself: \u201cThat girl would have appealed to her,\u201d and led by this sudden digression to think of her and of her death, I felt too unhappy to be able to pursue my own desire any further. As, long ago, the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise and Guermantes ways had established the conditions of my liking for the country and had prevented me from finding any real charm in a village where there was no old church, nor cornflowers, nor buttercups, so it was by attaching them in myself to a past full of charm that my love for Albertine made me seek out exclusively a certain type of woman; I began again, as before I was in love with her, to feel the need of things in harmony with her which would be interchangeable with a memory that had become gradually less exclusive. I could not have found any pleasure now in the company of a golden-haired and haughty duchess, because she would not have aroused in me any of the emotions that sprang from Albertine, from my desire for her, from the jealousy that I had felt of her love-affairs, from my sufferings, from her death. For our sensations, in order to be strong, need to release in us something different from themselves, a sentiment, which will not find any satisfaction, in pleasure, but which adds itself to desire, enlarges it, makes it cling desperately to pleasure. In proportion as the love that Albertine had felt for certain women ceased to cause me pain, it attached those women to my past, gave them something that was more real, as to buttercups, to hawthorn-blossom the memory of Combray gave a greater reality than to unfamiliar flowers. Even of Andr\u00e9e, I no longer said to myself with rage: \u201cAlbertine loved her,\u201d but on the contrary, so as to explain my desire to myself, in a tone of affection: \u201cAlbertine loved her dearly.\u201d I could now understand the widowers whom we suppose to have found consolation and who prove on the contrary that they are inconsolable because they marry their deceased wife\u2019s sister. Thus the decline of my love seemed to make fresh loves possible for me, and Albertine like those women long loved for themselves who, later, feeling their lover\u2019s desire grow feeble, maintain their power by confining themselves to the office of panders, provided me, as the Pompadour provided Louis XV, with fresh damsels. Even in the past, my time had been divided into periods in which I desired this woman or that. When the violent pleasures afforded by one had grown dull, I longed for the other who would give me an almost pure affection until the need of more sophisticated caresses brought back my desire for the first. Now these alternations had come to an end, or at least one of the periods was being indefinitely prolonged. What I would have liked was that the newcomer should take up her abode in my house, and should give me at night, before leaving me, a friendly, sisterly kiss. In order that I might have believed \u2014 had I not had experience of the intolerable presence of another person \u2014 that I regretted a kiss more than a certain pair of lips, a pleasure more than a love, a habit more than a person, I would have liked also that the newcomers should be able to play Vinteuil\u2019s music to me like Albertine, to talk to me as she had talked about Elstir. AH this was impossible. Their love would not be equivalent to hers, I thought, whether because a love to which were annexed all those episodes, visits to picture galleries, evenings spent at concerts, the whole of a complicated existence which allows correspondences, conversations, a flirtation preliminary to the more intimate relations, a serious friendship afterwards, possesses more resources than love for a woman who can only offer herself, as an orchestra possesses more resources than a piano, or because, more profoundly, my need of the same sort of affection that Albertine used to give me, the affection of a girl of a certain culture who would at the same time be a sister to me, was \u2014 like my need of women of the same class as Albertine \u2014 merely a recrudescence of my memory of Albertine, of my memory of my love for her. And once again, I discovered, first of all that memory has no power of invention, that it is powerless to desire anything else, even anything better than what we have already possessed, secondly that it is spiritual in the sense that reality cannot furnish it with the state which it seeks, lastly that, when applied to a person who is dead, the resurrection that it incarnates is not so much that of the need to love in which it makes us believe as that of the need of the absent person. So that the resemblance to Albertine of the woman whom I had chosen, the resemblance of her affection even, if I succeeded in winning it, to Albertine\u2019s, made me all the more conscious of the absence of what I had been unconsciously seeking, of what was indispensable to the revival of my happiness, that is to say Albertine herself, the time during which we had lived together, the past in quest of which I had unconsciously gone. Certainly, upon fine days, Paris seemed to me innumerably aflower with all these girls, whom I did not desire, but who thrust down their roots into the obscurity of the desire and the mysterious nocturnal life of Albertine. They were like the girls of whom she had said to me at the outset, when she had not begun to distrust me: \u201cThat girl is charming, what nice hair she has.\u201d All the curiosity that I had felt about her life in the past when I knew her only by sight, and on the other hand all my desires in life were blended in this sole curiosity, to see Albertine in company with other women, perhaps because thus, when they had left her, I should have remained alone with her, the last and the master. And when I observed her hesitations, her uncertainty when she asked herself whether it would be worth her while to spend the evening with this or that girl, her satiety when the other had gone, perhaps her disappointment, I should have brought to the light of day, I should have restored to its true proportions the jealousy that Albertine inspired in me, because seeing her thus experience them I should have taken the measure and discovered the limit of her pleasures. Of how many pleasures, of what an easy life she has deprived us, I said \u2014 to myself, by that stubborn obstinacy in denying her instincts! And as once again I sought to discover what could have been the reason for her obstinacy, all of a sudden the memory came to me of a remark that I had made to her at Balbec on the day when she gave me a pencil. As I rebuked her for not having allowed me to kiss her, I had told her that I thought a kiss just as natural as I thought it degrading that a woman should have relations with another woman. Alas, perhaps Albertine had never forgotten that imprudent speech\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I took home with me the girls who had appealed to me least, I stroked their virginal tresses, I admired a well-modelled little nose, a Spanish pallor. Certainly, in the past, even with a woman of whom I had merely caught sight on a road near Balbec, in a street in Paris, I had felt the individuality of my desire and that it would be adulterating it to seek to assuage it with another person. But life, by disclosing to me little by little the permanence of our needs, had taught me that, failing one person, we must content ourselves with another \u2014 and I felt that what I had demanded of Albertine another woman, Mme. de Stermaria, could have given me. But it had been Albertine; and what with the satisfaction of my need of affection and the details of her body, an interwoven tangle of memories had become so inextricable that I could no longer detach from a desire for affection all that embroidery of my memories of Albertine\u2019s body. She alone could give me that happiness. The idea of her uniqueness was no longer a metaphysical a priori based upon what was individual in Albertine, as in the case of the women I passed in the street long ago, but an a posteriori created by the contingent and indissoluble overlapping of my memories. I could no longer desire any affection without feeling a need of her, without grief at her absence. Also the mere resemblance of the woman I had selected, of the affection that I asked of her to the happiness that I had known made me all the more conscious of all that was lacking before that happiness could revive. The same vacuum that I had found in my room after Albertine had left, and had supposed that I could fill by taking women in my arms, I found in them. They had never spoken to me, these women, of Vinteuil\u2019s music, of Saint-Simon\u2019s memoirs, they had not sprayed themselves with too strong a scent before coming to visit me, they had not played at interlacing their eyelashes with mine, all of which things were important because, apparently, they allow us to weave dreams round the sexual act itself and to give ourselves the illusion of love, but in reality because they formed part of my memory of Albertine and it was she whom I would fain have seen again. What these women had in common with Albertine made me feel all the more clearly what was lacking of her in them, which was everything, and would never be anything again since Albertine was dead. And so my love for Albertine which had drawn me towards these women made me indifferent to them, and perhaps my regret for Albertine and the persistence of my jealousy, which had already outlasted the period fixed for them in my most pessimistic calculations, would never have altered appreciably, had their existence, isolated from the rest of my life, been subjected merely to the play of my memories, to the actions and reactions of a psychology applicable to immobile states, and had it not been drawn into a vaster system in which souls move in time as bodies move in space. As there is a geometry in space, so there is a psychology in time, in which the calculations of a plane psychology would no longer be accurate because we should not be taking into account time and one of the forms that it assumes, oblivion; oblivion, the force of which I was beginning to feel and which is so powerful an instrument of adaptation to reality because it gradually destroys in us the surviving past which is a perpetual contradiction of it. And I ought really to have discovered sooner that one day I should no longer be in love with Albertine. When I had realised, from the difference that existed between what the importance of her person and of her actions was to me and what it was to other people, that my love was not so much a love for her as a love in myself, I might have deduced various consequences from this subjective nature of my love and that, being a mental state, it might easily long survive the person, but also that having no genuine connexion with that person, it must, like every mental state, even the most permanent, find itself one day obsolete, be \u2018replaced,\u2019 and that when that day came everything that seemed to attach me so pleasantly, indissolubly, to the memory of Albertine would no longer exist for me. It is the tragedy of other people that they are to us merely showcases for the very perishable collections of our own mind. For this very reason we base upon them projects which have all the ardour of our mind; but our mind grows tired, our memory crumbles, the day would arrive when I would readily admit the first comer to Albertine\u2019s room, as I had without the slightest regret given Albertine the agate marble or other gifts that I had received from Gilberte\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

Yesterday LyricsOh, baby\nLet's pick up the pieces\nAnd let's work this thing out\n\nBring back the love of yesterday\nFrom me, you stole your love away\nThe look of love has left your eyes\nReplaced with anger and despise\n\nI can feel a chill in the air, it makes me cold\nAnd filled with despair\nThis raw silence leaves me dangling in space\nI'll sacrifice tomorrow just to see your smiling face\nThe seeds of jealousy are\nDestroying the love you have for me\nThere's no other woman near\nOther than you my lover\n\nGive me the love of yesterday\nDon't turn your back on me this way\nMy world is all wrapped up in you\nDeep in your heart, you know it's true\n\nSo come on, bring it back, bring it all back now\nBring it back, bring it all back, girl\nBring it back, bring it all back now\nBring it back, bring it all back now\n\nYesterday, your love was warm and tender\nBut now today, you stir the love, I'm empty\nWon't you tell me what's troubling your mind\nMaybe the two of us, a solution we can find\n\nI'll love you twice as strong\nTill every seed of doubt is gone\nThere's no other woman near\nOther than you my lover, give back\n\nBring back the love of yesterday\nOh, bring it all back now\nBring it all back now\nYou might also likeGirl, you know and I know\nWe had a good thing going\nAnd all those good times\nAin't no sense in blowing, ohh\n\nBring it back, bring it all back now\nBring it back, bring it all back now\n\nYou and me, we used to be\nSo good, so good\nNow, can't you see\nBring it on home\n\nBring it back, bring it back to love\nBring it back, girlEmbed"},

across and there I saw Billy\nWaiting to go and join the line\n\nAnd with her head upon his shoulder\nHis young and lovely fiancee\nFrom where I stood I saw she was cryin'\nAnd through her tears I heard her say:\n\n\"Billy, don't be a hero, don't be a fool with your life\nBilly, don't be a hero, come back and make me your wife\"\nAnd as Billy started to go she said: \"Keep your pretty head

Followers don't look at it so much as entertainment as they do a way of life.  You'll frequently see the makeup of these bands are family members, and many make it their life's work.  That kind of devotion says a lot about the values they see in the music. Whether it's history and tradition they hear, or that they hear it as a true expression of Americana, the performers and their audiences are passionate. You'll find a great presentation of this in a thesis by Leslie Blake Price entitled Bluegrass Nation: A Historical and Cultural Analysis of America's Truest Music.\n\nAny discussion of country or bluegrass music must acknow-ledge the contributions of the Carter Family.  They were one of the most influential groups in country music history, and they moved the emphasis from hillbilly instrumentals to \"folk stories in song\".  The original group consisted of A.P., his wife Sara, and her sister Maybelle.  They influenced all that followed in country and folk music, from Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Doc Watson all the way up to Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris and Ketch Secor.\n\nIt's unlikely that bluegrass music would exist today without the Carter Family's contributions. A.P. collected hundreds of Appalachian folk songs and rearranged them into the classics we have today.  They recorded hundreds of songs. but \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\", \"Wildwood Flower\", and \"Keep on the Sunny Side\" will give you a good sense of what their music did to build the folk tradition in country music.\n\nThat foundation work was built-up by those who followed.  In bluegrass, there are no better examples of where we are today today than Earl Skruggs' \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\", the Foggy Mountain Boys' \"Rollin' in My Sweet Baby's Arms\" or the Osborne Brothers' \"Rocky Top\", but here is a short list of more recent (and also great) examples of bluegrass and string music:Old Crow Medicine Show's \"Sweet Amarillo\"The SteelDrivers' \"Wearin' a Hole\"The Grascals' \"Old Friend of Mine\"Dailey & Vincent's \"Take Me Back (And Leave Me There)\"Aly Bain, Jerry Douglas and Russ Barenberg's\n\"St. Anne's Reel\"Wilson Banjo Company's \"95 Years\"Yonder Mountain String Band's \"Alison\"Top Ten Music Shrines in Tennessee\nIf you're into music and history, here are some great places to visit when you're in Tennessee:In the Coastal Plains region:Graceland - Memphis\nElvis promised his parents he'd build them the finest house in town, and put an end to years of struggle. Graceland was the fulfillment of that dream.Sun Studios - Memphis\nJohhny Cash, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis recorded here - all at the same time.Stax American Soul Music Museum - Memphis\nStax made hit soul music in the 50s and 60s, and this is one of only a few museums dedicated to soul.In the Nashville Basin region:Country Music Hall of Fame - Nashville\nThe museum\u2019s core exhibition is \"Sing Me Back Home: A Journey Through Country Music\". It's a full-immersion experience.Ryman Auditorium - Nashville\nThe first Grand Ole Opry started here in 1925. It's almost like being in a cathedral.Johnny Cash Museum - Nashville\nIt's captivating, real and raw - just like Cash himself.Jack Daniel's Distillery - Lynchburg\nWhat, you ask, does Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 have to do with Tennessee music?In the Cumberland/TN Valley/Unaka Mtns region:Cumberland Caverns - McMinnville\nBluegrass concerts are presented every month in the Volcano Room of Cumberland Caverns. They've been featured on NBC and PBS.Dollywood - Pigeon Forge\nThink of it as Disneyland with a bluegrass soundtrack.Birthplace of Country Music Museum - Bristol\nTells the story of the 1927 Bristol Sessions recordings that included the Carter Family and Jimmie RodgersTennessee Artists:Here's a list of some of the most famous musicians that were born in Tennessee or made the state their home. Each artist is listed with one - three songs to give you a sampler of their music. The list is long, but not comprehensive. Think of it as a primer. (With apologies to our Texas readers for the inclusion of Townes Van Zandt and other sons of the republic.

gate\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you see the real me, preacher, preacher?\nCan you see the real me, preacher?\n\n[Outro]\nCan you see, can you see, can you see, oh\nCan you see the real me doctor\nCan you see

or\u2005your\u2005quest for revenge\nYou're\u2005about to embark on a secret\u2005mission\nYou have been chosen to defend the realm of Earth\nIn a tournament called Mortal Kombat\n\n[Verse 1: Sen-Sey]\nYo I\u2019m not one to brag\nBut lately I get bag\nPaper plastic people spastic\nAsk me bout my path\nSo please beware my wrath\nPetty pencil pushing putty cats\nWhat\u2019s new with your act\nCould he would we autograph\nI know cray gonna lay low\nWear that hate like a halo\nMJ hoe mamasay mamasa\nNow want you try\nDon\u2019t be fly\nThis your favorite verse\nThat\u2019s why it goes first\nI don\u2019t even curse that\u2019s just how it works\nYou see how we rock\nNow watch how we roll\nAnd we six deep kill on instinct\nSo I\u2019m in sync with bars being in awe\nSweat the technique come check me\nMy mystic my blessings\nI use as lethal weapons\nWhen stressing\nSo y\u2019all can keep the rapping\nCause it\u2019s the furthest thing from real\nAnd the closest thing to actors\nSo yes I called you average\nHere to set a counter balance\nTo influence better music\nAnd I still do it for fun\nRapping is never easy\nSo imma keep it going\nTill the urge leave me\n[Bridge 1]\nWelcome your here to compete in Mortal Kombat\n\n[Verse 2: TreNovacane]\nComing in like the opposite of birth\nWe don\u2019t need the critics\nSo we don\u2019t need to rehearse\nCollect the hearses kill the verse\nCause we just that dope\nWe can cook it cut it check it taste it\nIt\u2019s a go\nCheck the master rhyme\nIt\u2019s not the stereotypical flow\nAnd I kill the industry\nWith the underground railroad\nBesides tho like I\u2019m on the ocean\nWith the battleships\nGet your location I ain\u2019t no games\nWhen we shooting shit\nAnd it ain\u2019t about money\nThen that shit is just too irrelevant\nMy girl say she was celibate\nI said that\u2019s cool cause I\u2019m feeling me\nWe use to fuck like jack rabbits\nUntil she lost the energy\nNobodies on the drum\nI use to beat it down until she sleep\nBut lately I been thinking\nThat baby coming out of heat\nAnd in her messages\nShe telling all these niggas\nThat she\u2019s a freak\nNow they gone\nWhat you know\nShe come back begging on knees\nSaying that she\u2019s sorry\nAnd she just wanted to be a queen\nYou might also like[Bridge 2]\nTomorrow morning the great combat begins\nSome will have the distinct honor\nAnd pleasure\nTo face Prince Goro\n\n[Verse 3: Kai-Ju]\nKaiju is the name\nI'm coming to run the game\nKilling these rappers\nSlaves to the masters\nCall me Django Unchained\nI'm spitting lyrics so insane\nThat makes the Joker go and look sane\nWhile i'm getting all of this fame\nI'm counting money like Bruce Wayne\nI got denairo\nYour posse full of bendejos\nYou talking all that shit\nBut you steady lacking your webos\nThe game ain't been the same\nSince Derwin left san diego\nAll these fake rappers\nBlowing air like tornadoes\nClaiming that they hard\nI've played harder kids in halo\nYour rhyming skills are way low\nWhile i'm on the next plateau\nImma be honest\nThink its time for you to let go\nTime to make way\nFor the New Rapping Van Go\nTake shots\nNo Free Throws\nGame Time\nNo Cheat Codes\nOne Shot\nNo Reloads\nEgon with Ego\nYo Time Un Poquito\nNo Habla Un Gringo\nDo not knock on the door unless necessito\n[Bridge 3]\nYou are witnesses to a great turning point\nIn the history of your planet\nTreasure these moments...\n\n[Verse 4: K19]\nSwear these rappers be like\nBlah blah blah\nBlah blah blah\nSelling dope\nBlah blah blah\nBlah blah blah\nSelling coke\nBlah blah blah\nBlah blah blah\nTell a joke\nThem last bars\nWas iller than anything you ever wrote\nTo be a good rapper\nYou ain\u2019t gotta make it complex\nThis ain\u2019t no vocabulary contest\nI\u2019m content with content\nAnd concepts with bars like a prison\nTell do you get the concept\nOk ok ok\nYou know who i am\nIt\u2019s K19 right now\nI\u2019m feeling like the man\nAnd I\u2019m on a mission\nTo be the ill-est on the planet\nYou artist boo boo\nI will doo doo on your canvas\nThe way this world works\nI\u2019m starting to understand it\nYou gotta work for what you want\nAin\u2019t nothing handed it\nWe all broke tell me why is Uncle Sam rich\nTrying get my hands on some bread\nA knuckle sandwichEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/978536",

state\n\n[Verse 1]\nAnd I was young enough\nTo think I was good enough to be his opening act\nAnd in a cloud of smoke he took another toke\nAnd counted one, two, three\nAnd I knew right there just breathing his air\nWhat I wanted to be\n[Chorus]\nBuckaroos and jaded lovers\nL.A. freeway and redneck mother\nMothers who had raised a son so well\nTalking outlawed, long hair loners and stoners\nSinging about to come back home and\nMost likely too far gone to get there\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey, Kix, that was 76\nThat was just enough beer\nTo get us through the set\nAnd get as high as our crowd\nWe got 700 miles Jerry, we gotta go\nYou're out of your mind;\nYou'll never make it on time\nWhy not just have another round\nOh, we were trying get paid\nJust trying to get laid\nLiving on love\nSleeping on the stage\nJust turn another page\nNever thinking we'd ever grow up\n\n[Chorus]\nSee Brooks & Dunn LiveGet tickets as low as $107You might also like[Verse 3]\nWell, the way I recall the 70's\nWe were down in Austin and the establishment were\nSaying we were wasting our time\nThe next thing I know\nWe were making more money than we could count\nWe're all being sued by the IRS\nAnd having more fun than the law allowed\nYeah, I'm talking loners and stoners\nAnd sing about to come back home\nAnd most likely too far gone to get there\nYeah, they were all most likely too far gone to get there\n\n[Outro]\nJerry Jeff Walker stumbled up the stairs on his way to the\nStage with a Martin guitar and a six pack\nTools of the trade sonEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

WAYNE MANOR - SUNSET\n\nA beautiful, sprawling suburban estate at sunset.  Classic wrought-iron\ngates protect a winding driveway which snakes its way up through a\nneatly manicured lawn.\n\nINT. WAYNE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nALFRED PENNYWORTH, the Wayne family butler, fluffs up a cushion in the\nlarge, elegant living room.  A kind-looking man in his late forties\nwith dark moustache and hair, he epitomizes the proper British moor\ndomo, dressed in a morning coat and striped vest.\n\nAlfred turns, straightens up a pile of thick-looking papers on the\nliving room table.  He picks up the top one, looks at it critically,\nbut with satisfaction.\n\nINSERT SHOT - CAMPAIGN POSTER\n\nThe thick-looking papers are, in fact, political campaign posters.\nThey feature the face of a handsome, fortyish man, with the block\nlettered caption: DR. THOMAS WAYNE FOR CITY COUNCIL - A BETTER TOMORROW\nFOR GOTHAM.\nDR. WAYNE'S VOICE\nBruce?  Hurry up, son, we're going\nto be late.  Martha?\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nAlfred turns to look at DR. THOMAS WAYNE (the man on the poster) enters\nthe room.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nNow where's Martha?  Alfred, have\nyou seen Mrs. Wayne?\n\nALFRED\nI believe she was headed for Master\nBruce's laboratory. Sir.\n\nDr. Wayne checks his watch, exits, muttering.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nThat nymphomaniacal hamster of his\nmust have given birth again...\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\nDr. Wayne heads down the hallway towards a door.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nCome on, everybody, the movie starts\nin less than an hour.  Let's not\nkeep you next city councilman\nwaiting...\n\nINT. BRUCE'S LAB\n\nDr. Wayne opens the door.  The makeshift lab room has a large work\ntable crammed with beakers, test tubes, and other scientific equipment.\nBRUCE WYANE, aged ten, sits behind a microscope, peers down intently at\na specimen on a slide.  He does not look up as his father enters.\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(crossing)\nSon, whatever you're looking at\ncouldn't possible be as pretty as\nAudrey Hepburn, so...\n\nDr. Wayne puts his hand on Bruce's shoulder.  Incredibly enough - it\npasses right through it!  He recoils, shocked, reaches out to touch the\nbody's head.  His hand cuts right through the skull.  Giggling is\nHEARD, O.S.\n\nYoung Bruce stands behind the door with his mother, MARTHA, a beautiful\nwoman in her mid-thirties.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's called a \"holograph,\" dad.  Two\nInterconnecting laser beams...\n(pointing)\nThere and there.  Pretty neat, huh?\n\nDr. Wayne stares at the laser tubes, totally nonplussed.\n\nMARTHA\nWell, don't look at me.  My side\nof the family still can't figure out\nwhy it gets dark at night.  Ready to\ngo?\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(eyes narrowing)\nHow can I be sure you're the real\nthing?\n\nMartha kisses him warmly.  He looks back, impressed.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nSomewhat lifelike, I'll admit...\n\nMARTH\nThat's all?  Then hold on to your\nsocks, buster...\n\nShe kisses him again with passion.  Bruce turns away with the typical\nself-consciousness of a pre-adolescent.\n\nBRUCE\nOh, guy...\n\nHis parents break.  Dr. Wayne looks down at him.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nBruce, you may be the brightest ten\nyear old in Gotham City, or any-\nwhere else, for that matter.  But I\nfeel I ought to let you in on some-\nthing.\n(at Martha)\nThis - is definitely not a guy.\n\nINT. PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT\n\nA huge 35mm motion picture projector springs to life.\n\nINT. THEATER\n\nThe shifting colored rays of a projected film knife though the\nblackness of the theater.\n\nSCREEN VOICE\nSister, you make a beautiful nun.\n\nANGLE ON MOVIE SCREEN\n\nThe screen is filled by the face of AUDREY HEPBURN, dressed as a nun.\nWe are watched The Nun's Story, as are:\n\nANGLE ON WAYNE FAMILY IN SEATS\n\nDr. Wayne, Martha, and Bruce, who downs the remains of his box of Good\nand Plenty.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MOVIE THEATER & STREET - NIGHT\n\nRumblings of distant thunder echo through the night sky.  The Wayne\nfamily exits the theater, heads down a deserted street.  Suddenly - a\nflash of lightning.  A closer, louder clap of thunder.  Dr. Wayne takes\nMartha's arm.  Bruce straggles behind, staring at the pavement.\n\nDR.

Freeze!\n\nA large man (JOE CHILL) partially hidden by shadows, points a gun at\nthem.

WAYNE\nYou're welcome to our money.  Any-\nthing we have.  Okay?\n\nChill stares coldly.  Dr. Wayne pulls out his money, takes off his\nwatch.  Martha and Bruce watch, petrified.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nHere...just be careful with that\ngun, will you?  It could go off...\n\nCHILL\nYou know something, Doc?  You're\nright.\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(expression changing)\nDoc?

Chill turns.\n\nCHILL\nLet's have that necklace, lady...\n\nMARTHA\nOh, my God!\n\nMartha tries to escape but is jerked back by Chill's hand as it closes\non her necklace.  Bruce runs at Chill, grabs him by the leg, tries to\npull him down.\n\nBRUCE\nLeave my mommy alone!  Mommy!\nMommy!\n\nChill fires again!  The necklace snaps free as Martha is jerked\nbackwards, then crumples next to her husband.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nHe kneels over his mother's body, pauses in shock, then looks up: the\nbarrel of Chill's gun comes into frame.\n\nCLOSE ON CHILL\n\nThe necklace in one hand, his gun in the other.  He looks down at\nBruce, his expression suddenly changing.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHe stares at Chill, his jaw inadvertently twitching with rage.  A LOUD\nCLAP OF THUNDER rolls across the sky.  Bruce's eyes have become steel,\nvisible fury shooting forth from them in an almost demonic fashion.\n\nChill's gun hand suddenly starts to tremble.  Incredibly, the savage\nface of this young boy has unnerved him.\n\nCHILL\nStop...lookin' at me like that, kid...\n(no response)\nStop looking at me like that!\n\nSuddenly - A FLASH OF LIGHTNING!  Rain begins to fall in sheets.\nChill, runs up to the street, disappears into the rain-swept darkness.\n\nANGLE ON APARTMENT BUILDING\n\nLIGHTS have flicked on in the apartment building across the street.\nFACELESS WITNESSES stand silhouetted in the windows, gazing down at the\ntragedy across the street.\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN on one particular window.  A SHADOWY FIGURE half-\nemerges from the darkness, his face still hidden from us.  All that is\nvisible is an oversized pair of striped pants and a large white daisy\nstuck through the coat lapel.  The Shadowy Figure pauses, then reaches\nout an arm and slowly lowers the window shade.\n\nFrom behind the shade - an insane, maniacal giggle starts to rise.\nTiny at first, but gradually building to a sudden explosion of\ncascading, frightening glee!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nKneeling in the rain across the street, paralyzed with shock and grief.\nHe looks up from the bodies of his parents as a COUPLE approaches along\nthe pavement above.\n\nBRUCE'S VOICE\nHelp...oh, please help me...\n\nThe couple stop, stare down at the scene.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's...my mom and dad.  Please...I\nthink they're dead.\n\nThe couple exchange a quick, horrified glance, then hurry off down the\nstreet.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nSobbing uncontrollably now, tears mixing with the rain.  In the\ndistance: the low whine of an approaching siren.  CAMERA RISES into the\nnight sky:\n\nA FLASHING BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS ACROSS THE SCREEN: the residue\nremains in the night sky - a searing yellow dot.  ANOTHER BOLT OF\nLIGHTNING - another yellow dot.  Then a deafening clap of thunder as\nthe gray-black clouds arrange themselves into a dark and eerie\nsilhouette.  The siren grows louder, piercing shrilly through the\nrumblings of the storm.  The SILHOUETTE becomes more familiar now, as\nthe billowing clouds form themselves into a dark cape.  The dots of\nlightning begin to pulsate as they evolve into two searing yellow eyes.\n\nThis then, is the signal of the future presence of the Dark Redeemer of\nthe Night.  The Black Wraith.

A revolting perversion of a\nhuman being with a chalk-white complexion, ruby red lips, and a\nstartling shock of green hair.  He continues to giggle as he reads.  A\nCONFEDERATE stands behind.  The Vendor continues to stare as The Joker\nsuddenly notices.\n\nJOKER\nSomething wrong?\n\nVENDOR\nYour...face.  It's...\n\nJOKER\nFamiliar?

The Man in the chair swivels around\nslowly: It is JOE CHILL!\n\nThe Joker stands at the entrance to the room, lowers a remote control\nbox.  He grins at Chill.  Chill stares back nervously, clearly\nfrightened by The Joker's maniacal presence.\n\nCHILL\nI was...headed for the airport.\nThey said you wanted to see me.\nSomething...wrong?\n\nJOKER\nWrong?  I thought we'd celebrate.  I\nthought you'd like to join me in a\ndrink.\n\nCHILL\n(visibly relieved)\nWhy not...\n\nThe Joker leads him to a table, suddenly glowers darkly.\n\nJOKER\nYou know, I'm disappointed in you,\nJoe.  Very disappointed.\n\nCHILL\n(swallowing)\nYou...are?\n\nJOKER\nI said, \"Would you like to join me\nin a drink.\"  Then you're supposed\nto say, \"Sure there'll be room\nenough for both of us?\"\n(giggle)\nGet it?\n(louder giggle)\n\"Room enough...\"\n\nCHILL\nYeah...sure...I get it now...\n\nJOKER\nYou're a quick study, Joe.\n\nThe Joker claps him on the back as they sit at the table.  The\nConfederate enters with two glasses on a tray.  One contains a clear\nliquid.  The other - a bilious, thick yellow concoction.  The Joker\nedges it across the table toward Chill who eyes it suspiciously.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nDrink up.\n\nChill examines the yellow liquid, wary.\n\nCHILL\nHow come...you ain't drinkin' this...\n\nJOKER\nGood question.

The corners of his mouth twitch, then rise involuntarily.\nHe snickers.  Again.  Starts to giggle.  The Joker's eyes narrow.  His\nsmile becomes cruel.\n\nJOKER\nThe doctor says, \"I can sure you.  The\ndisease is hereditary.\"  The patient\nsays, \"Then send the bill to my father.\"\n\nChill instantly explodes with laughter!\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nHe says, \"Help me, Doctor, I've got\namnesia.\"  Doctor says, \"How long\nhave you had it?\"  He says, \"How\nlong have I had what?\"\n\nChill is on his feet now, convulsed in glee.

Bruce turns, glares up at the rings\nlike deadly enemies.  He jumps again, catches hold, starts to hoist\nhimself up, straining with the effort.  The veins standing out on his\nforehead.  Slowly, painfully, he begins to inch himself higher and\nhigher.\n\nINT KARATE STUDIO - DAY\n\nBruce is dressed in a martial arts outfit, tensely faces a thick pine\nboard being held by a Japanese INSTRUCTOR.\n\nINSTRUCTOR\n...but you must believe, really\nbelieve you can do it.

He pauses at full extension, then\nswings back, launches himself towards the parallel bars.\n\nCatching the bars expertly, he performs a complicated routine, pausing\nat the top to look across the room:\n\nA thin balance beam sits below, ten feet away.\n\nBruce swings back one more time on the upper parallel bar, then flies\nthrough the air for the beam!  His feet land on top for one split,\ntenuous second.  He teeters - then crashes heavily to the floor.\nShaking his head to clear the cobwebs, he stares back at the beam,\ndetermined.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY\n\nAlfred exits the rear of Wayne Manor onto the lawn, looks around,\nmystified.\n\nALFRED\nMaster Bruce?

A thick rope encircles the\nchimney of Wayne Manor as Bruce makes his way up the structure, hand\nover hand.  Suddenly:  the old brick chimney STARTS TO CRUMBLE!  The\nrope jerks free as bricks fly everywhere and Bruce tumbles heavily down\nto the lawn at Alfred'' feet.\n\nBruce looks up, grins sheepishly.

Cool,\nclear eyes flick in the opposite direction as:\n\nTwo STUDENTS charge him!  He flips one over his head, flips the other\nwhile simultaneously spinning around to face the Instructor who closes\nranks from behind.\n\nThe fight is furiously expert - hands and feet working like windmills.\nBruce is parrying every thrust the\nInstructor has to offer, countering every move, but is nonetheless\nbeing backed into a corner.\n\nThe Instructor moves in for the kill as Bruce suddenly vaults up and\nover him in a seven-foot backflip!  Grabbing the man's black belt from\nbehind for leverage, he hoists the Instructor over his head, then sends\nthe bewildered man flying through the air, crashing onto the mat in a\nheap.\n\nBruce looks over, suddenly concerned.  He holds the Instructor's black\nbelt in his hands.  The Instructor is half-dazed, in some pain.  His\neyes suddenly pop open - he grins broadly back at Bruce.\n\nINSTRUCTOR\nThat's okay.  Keep it.\n\nINT. BALLET STUDIO - DAY\n\nA line of beautiful young would-be BALLERINAS perform the various\npositions at the bar in a dance studio to the musical strains of Swan\nLake.

EXERCISE ROOM - DAY\n\nCAMERA PANS past the balancing beam, parallel bars, and exercise rings\nto Bruce, who faces them confidently, but this time with a big\ndifference - HE IS BLINDFOLDED.  He takes a tentative step forward,\ngauging his distance, then leaps up into the air - grabbing the rings\nwith perfect accuracy!  He performs a series of difficult routines with\nclockwork precision, then swings through the air to the parallel bars,\nlatching on to the lower one, then propelling himself up to the higher\none.  His gyrations become faster, gaining speed and momentum.\nSuddenly - he launches himself toward the balance beam!\n\nBruce lands on the end of the beam like a cat - keeping his balance,\nhaving calculated the exact distance to the inch.  He steps forward\nwith total security, travels the length of the beam with the ease of a\npedestrian.  Reaching the end, he does a complete forward somersault,\nlands solidly on his feet.

APARTMENT STREET - NIGHT\n\nBruce crosses the street to a gleaming Aston-Martin sportscar.  ANOTHER\nTHUNDER CLAP!  Rain falls as he reaches into the car, takes out a\ntopcoat and hat.  He starts to pull the convertible top up, glances\ndown the street:\n\nPEOPLE scurry to avoid the rain.  Down the block, across the street, a\nCOUPLE with a YOUNG DAUGHTER look over nervously as a tough-looking\nBIKER on a huge Harley-Davidson rolls up parallel to them on the\nstreet.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nAdjusting the convertible top.  Looking off again.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE'S P.O.V.\n\nSuddenly:  the Biker hops the curb in front of the Family!  Pulling a\ngun, he herds them back into a dark alleyway.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nEyes narrowing.  His jaw twitches.  A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT!  Bruce\nexplodes across the street for the alleyway.\n\nAs Bruce arrives:  the Young Girl bursts out screaming, runs past him.\nBruce hesitates, then runs inside the alley.\n\nANGLE IN ALLEYWAY\n\nThe Man lies in the alley, being cradled by the Woman.  Blood oozes\nfrom the side of his head Bruce arrives.\n\nWOMAN\nI...think he'll be all right.  Our\ndaughter's run to call an ambulance.\n\nBruce hears the REVVING of a motorcycle.  He looks off down the alley,\neyes flashing with anger.\n\nANGLE DOWN ALLEY - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe Biker grins at him from the far end of the alley, puts his Harley\nin gear, rolls off through the pouring rain.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHe makes his decision, takes off in pursuit.\n\nWOMAN\nCareful!  He's got a gun!\n\nEXT. END OF ALLEYWAY\n\nBruce arrives at the alley corner, looks off:\n\nANGLE ON BIKER - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe Biker hovers by the side of an apartment building, still grinning\nat Bruce through the rain.  He rolls forward slowly, almost as if\nenticing Bruce to follow him, now disappears again.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce arrives at the rear of the building, which faces on a vacant dirt\nlot.  He edges forward through the mud, turning the corner, suddenly\ncoming face to face with:\n\nThe Biker.  Still grinning.  Switching off his Harley.  Muscles bulging\nthrough his wet T-shirt as he dismounts.\n\nBIKER\nCongratulations, man.\n(wide smile)\nYou caught me.  Matter of fact...\n\nThe ROAR OF ENGINES is HEARD!  Bruce turns to see:  TWO MORE BIKERS,\nrolling into position behind him.  Bruce is hopelessly trapped.\n\nBIKER (CONT'D)\n...you caught all of us...\n\nThe other two Bikers now dismount and close in.  The first Biker draws\nhis gun.  Biker #2 looks Bruce up and down critically, squinting at him\nthrough the rain.\n\nBIKER #2\nThat's my raincoat you're wearing.\nTake it off.\n\nBiker #2 snaps his arm forward - a switchblade appears in his hand.  He\nflicks it at Bruce who stands his ground, slicing a button off the\nfront of his raincoat.\n\nBIKER #2 (CONT'D)\nPick up the button, Wimpy.  Then\nlick it clean and hand me my coat.\n\nBruce stares icily, then slowly bends down to retrieve the button from\nthe mud.  Suddenly:  Biker #1's foot flashes INTO FRAME, headed\nstraight at Bruce's face!  In a lightning-quick move, Bruce grabs the\nswinging leg with both hands, rises, swings Biker #1 off the ground in\na circle, sends him crashing into the motorcycles as his gun goes\nflying.\n\nBiker #2, switchblade in hand, rushes Bruce.  Biker #3 unhooks chains\nfrom his belt.  Bruce sidesteps:  the knife slashes through his\nraincoat, sending it billowing out behind him like a cape!  Biker #3\nwhistles the chains past Bruce's ear:  He snatches them, karate-kicks\nBiker #3 in the stomach, simultaneously belting Biker #2 across the\nside of the head with the chains, knocking him unconscious.\n\nBiker #3 lunges at Bruce from behind!  Bruce spins, grabbing his arm,\ntwisting the knife away, catching it in his other hand as he trips\nBiker #3, sends him sprawling in the mud.  Bruce now straddles him,\nknife in hand.\n\nCLOSE ON BIKER #3\n\nBlinking in fear, his head pressed into the mud next to the button.\n\nBRUCE\nYour turn to pick up the button,\nscumbag...\n\nBiker #3's arm slowly starts forward as Bruce steps on it.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nWith your mouth.\n\nBiker #3 shuts his eyes in humiliation as:  THE SOUND OF A SIREN IS\nHEARD!\n\nANGLE ON SIDE OF BUILDING\n\nTWO POLICEMEN round the corner of the apartment building, now stop,\nstare in astonished silence at:\n\nThe Three Bikers, sprawled in the mud near their machines.  Bruce has\ncompletely disappeared.\n\nEXT. ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT\n\nA paramedic van is parked at the entrance.  Umbrella-holding ONLOOKERS\nwatch.  A gurney with the wounded Man is wheeled out.  The Woman and\nthe Young Girl follow.\n\nBruce appears at the edge of the crowd, collar still up, hat adjusted\nlow over his face  He stares.\n\nThe Paramedics stop.  One leans down, examines the Man, then covers his\nface with the sheet.  The Woman turns away in silence.  The Young Girl\nclings to her.\n\nBruce watches,  his eyes filled with tears.  He turns, walks off as\nCAMERA RACKS FOCUS to the pouring rain.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA RACKS BACK from the rain to Bruce, standing by the Aston-Martin\nin front of Wayne Manor.\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nBruce enters the empty living room.  His expression is numb.  He\npauses, lost in thought.  Then, moving as if by instinct, he heads for\nthe stairs leading to the basement.\n\nINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nBruce descends the stairs, walks down the hallway to a door.  He stops,\nlooks down at the heavy padlock which seals it shut.  His eyes close in\npain, remembering an earlier time.\n\nINT. YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - NIGHT\n\nSeen through dim half-light:  his childhood lab is coated with dust - a\nroom obviously left unused for years.  We hear A KEY TURNING IN THE\nLOCK.  The door to the lab swings open.  Bruce trains a flashlight on\nthe interior of the musty room.  He enters, finds a light switch, flips\nit on.\n\nThe lab table is much as we remember it, crammed with old test tubes,\nbeakers, etc.  Bruce crosses, stares down, lost in his past, then\nswitches on the holograph machine.  He stares - stunned and amazed as:\n\nTHE HOLOGRAPH FIGURE OF TEN-YEAR-OLD BRUCE WAYNE SPRINGS TO LIFE!  An\nexact visual reproduction of the Child who used to be.  The Young Boy\npeers down through a cobwebbed microscope in precisely the position we\nfirst saw him.\n\nBruce's eyes fill with tears - he shuts them tightly as he hears a\nVOICE from long ago.\n\nYOUNG BRUCE'S VOICE\nIt's called a holograph, Dad.\nPretty neat, huh?\n\nOne laser beam suddenly shorts out with age:  the image of Young Bruce\ndisappears.  The second beam continues to burn, its energy directed at\na disintegrating basement wall.\n\nBruce slumps at the other side of the table, oblivious, his face buried\nin his hands.\n\nOVERLAPPING IMAGES AND VOICE START TO APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.\n\nMartha Wayne\t\t\t   - giggling with Young Bruce, then kissing\nher husband passionately.\n\nDR. WAYNE'S VOICE\nThis - is definitely not a guy.\n\nThomas Wayne\t\t\t  - his face twisted in anguish as Chill's\nbullet blows.\n\nMARTHA'S VOICE\nOh, my God!  No!!\n\nA SHARP CRACK!\t    - As a piece of something crumbles away.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nLooking up.  Staring across the room:\n\nThe remaining laser beam has eaten away a piece of the basement wall -\nthere is a dull ECHOING THUD as the plaster hits the bottom of some\nunseen cavernous space below.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nRising.  Crossing curiously to the hole in the wall.  Training his\nflashlight torch through it.\n\nANGLE DOWN HOLE - HIS P.O.V.\n\nAN IMMENSE CAVERN trails down and away into the blackness.  A network\nof aged timbers intersect themselves, shoring up the side of the\nfoundation.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring.  Playing his flashlight against the visible parts of the\nunderground cavity.  He picks up a beaker from the lab table, then lets\nit fall through the hole.  There is an interminable wait.  Finally -\nthe impact of SHATTERING GLASS.\n\nANGLE BACK THROUGH HOLE\n\nSeen from inside:  the torch beam shines.  Suddenly - a long length of\nrope is tossed through.  Bruce appears in the opening.  He wriggles\nthrough, hanging on to the rope.\n\nBruce expertly shimmies down the rope, a man completely at home in an\naction he knows well.  The beam from the torch dances across the walls\nof the cavern:  high-ribbed, jagged walls, suggesting some sort of\nlabyrinth beyond.  The rope has played out.  Bruce hangs by the end,\nlooks down, lets himself fall to the cavern floor below.\n\nHe rises, plays the torch against the sides of the cave.\n\nANGLE ON BEAM - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe beam searches into crannies, exploring dark gray walls.  It comes\nacross a large patch of solid black.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nLooking curiously.\n\nBACK TO BLACK PATCH\n\nAs the beam hits the black patch fully - dozens of yellow eyes appear.\nThe entire mass LAUNCHES ITSELF INTO CAMERA with a terrifying screech\nand the sound of beating wings.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHis jaw drops, stunned, as THE COLONY OF BATS swarm over him!  He\nstumbles, protecting his face.  The torch drops to the floor.  Its\nshaft of light dances crazily around the cavern.\n\nFrom O.S. - a low moan is heard from Bruce.  It rises, gathers in\nvolume and intensity, gradually becoming a deep, booming guttural roar\n- at once a scream of total pain and a cry of defiance.  The terrified\nbats scream back in a maze of hot and cold light bouncing off beating\nblack wings.\n\nINT. ALFRED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe wind and rain batter against Alfred's partially open bedroom\nwindow.  Mixed with the sounds - a strong echo of the roar from the\ncavern.  Alfred's eyes pop open.  He rises groggily, makes his way to\nthe window, closes it.  CAMERA HOLDS on window, PANS UP to the moon.\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nEXT. CEMETERY - CLOSE ON MOON - NIGHT\n\nA FLASHING LIGHTNING BOLT:  CAMERA PANS DOWN from the moon through the\nraging storm to the graves of Thomas and Martha Wayne in the country\ncemetery, high on the hill.\n\nKneeling between them is Bruce - fists clenched, head bowed, tiny\nrivulets of water running off his face and body - totally lost in\nsilent prayer.\n\nBRUCE'S VOICE\nI've worked hard to make you proud of\nme.  To become the kind of person\nwhose presence could make a difference\nin the world.  But one man can only do\nonly so much, Father.  Mother, to-\nnight I saw the sign I thought would\nnever come.  Now - for the first time\nI realize I must...be...more...than\na man.\n\nA FLASHING LIGHTNING BOLT WIPES THE SCREEN!\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SKY - NIGHT\n\nThe remaining gossamer wisp of a transparent cloud pulls away from a\nglowing FULL MOON over Gotham City.\n\nINT. GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\nAn express train roars through a seedy subway station.\n\nINT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT\n\nA well-scrubbed TEENAGE COUPLE sit together holding hands.  The BOY is\ndressed in a dinner jacket, the GIRL is a chiffon party dress with a\nprominent orchid corsage pinned to it.  They exchange a nervous glance,\nlooking across the car at:\n\nA TOUGH-LOOKING THUG who sits opposite them, his muscular arms bulging\nthrough a torn windbreaker.  He grins across at the nervous Teenagers\nmenacingly, exposing yellow teeth, then sneaks a sideways look at:  A\nTHICKLY-BUILT TRUCKDRIVER-TYPE who stares straight ahead.\n\nThese are the only four people in the car.\n\nThe subway slows for the next stop.  The Truckdriver-Type rises\ndisinterestedly, crosses the car, looks down at the Teenagers who are\nnone too happy with his departure.\n\nTRUCKDRIVER-TYPE\nHave a nice time at the prom, kids?\n\nBOY\nYes, thank you, Sir.\n\nThe subway doors hiss open.  The Truckdriver-Type smiles and exits.\nThe Teenagers looks across the car worried.\n\nThe car pulls out of the station.  The Thug rises, crosses the car,\ngrabs hold of a vertical pole to steady himself, smirks down at the\nTeenagers.\n\nTHUG\nYou smell good enough to eat, Sweet-\nheart.\n\nBOY\n(nervous bravado)\nIf you've got something to say,\nMister, talk to me, okay?\n\nTHUG\nI was talking to you - Sweetheart.\n\nA knife drops out of the Thug's sleeve into his hand, its razor-sharp\nblade glinting in the light.  The Teenagers freeze with terror.\n\nTHUG (CONT'D)\nMaybe it's that flower that smells\nso good.\n\nThe Thug plucks the corsage off the trembling Girl's bodice, holds it\nup to his nose, inhales deeply, shaking his head.\n\nTHUG (CONT'D)\nNope.  Still can't place it.\n\nVOICE\nFunny.  I can smell you from way\nover here.\n\nThe Thug wheels, stares off at the end of the car, his jaw dropping\nopen.  The Teenagers' eyes bulge in disbelief.\n\nCLOSE ON CHEST\n\nA golden circle with the black figure of a bat sits in the middle of a\nsteel-gray skin-tight fabric stretched across a massively muscled\nchest.\n\nVOICE\nGive the lady back her flower.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Thug looks his unseen adversary up and down cautiously, unsure of\nwhether to laugh or obey.\n\nTHUG\nOkay...sure.  Just wanted to have a\nlittle fun.  I...\n\nWith a sudden lightning move he flips the switchblade in his hand,\nsending it whizzing in the direction of the Voice.\n\nCLOSE ON KNIFE\n\nThe knife whistles through the air TOWARD CAMERA.  Suddenly a black-\ngloved hand miraculously snatches it out of mid-air, spinning it, then\nsends it flying back!\nThe switchblade pierces the corsage, jerking it out of the Thug's hand,\nsticking it into the wall where it quivers behind him.  The Thug\nfreezes, turning white.\n\nVOICE\nNow then.  I think you said you\nwanted to have a little fun.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\nThe express wheezes to a stop at the next station.  A MIDDLE-AGED\nCOUPLE waits for the doors to open, then enter the car.  They suddenly\nstop, staring in amazement:\n\nThe Thug stands spread-eagled in the middle of the car, both wrists\ncuffed to overhanging metal handholds.  The center vertical pole\ndisappears up one pants leg, finally reappearing out of the collar of\nhis shirt.\n\nThe teenage Boy passes the amazed Couple, confidently dusting his\nhands.  He reaches back for the Girl who sniffs her corsage, then\nfollows him out of the car.\n\nEXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nGotham Police Headquarters.  CAMERA TRACKS PAST cubicles and offices,\nCLACKING, RINGING, DETECTIVES interrogating SUSPECTS, etc., catching up\nwith DAVID GORDON, the Commissioner of Police, a gruff-looking man in\nhis middle fifties who pauses to light a cheap cigarette.\n\nHeading toward him from the other direction:  SERGEANT HALEY, a smooth-\nfaced kissass in his thirties.\n\nGORDON\nWhat's up Haley?\n\nHALEY\nPretty slow, Commissioner.

ANOTHER BURGLAR has managed to open a wall\nsafe and begins stuffing valuables into a gunny sack.\n\nCAMERA ZOOMS BACK!\n\nWe are some thirty stories higher across a wide avenue.\n\nA black-gloved hand ENTERS FRAME, holding a thin, clear nylon cord with\na tiny barbed fishhook on the end.\n\nThe other gloved hand steadies a gleaming titanium rifle barrel with an\ninfrared scope.  The fishhook is threaded through the chamber.\n\nA flap is opened in a thick, compartmentalized black belt.  The\nmoonlight glints off a cylindrical silver gas cartridge.\n\nANGLE ACROSS STREET THROUGH SCOPE\n\nSeen through the magnified infrared scope:  the cross hairs of the\nrifle sight settle in on the head of the Burglar holding the shotgun.\n\nThe cross hairs pause - then suddenly lower to the balcony.  The rifle\nFIRES with an audible \"hiss\" of compressed gas.\n\nANGLE ON ROSETTA BALCONY\n\nAs the fishhook whistles through a hole in the rosetta stone framework\nof the balcony.  On impact with the floor it pops open - expanding to\nten times its size, having now become an effective grappling hook.\n\nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe Burglar with the shotgun turns at the muffled metallic NOISE, looks\nthrough the glass doors at the empty balcony.\n\nEXT. BALCONY FLOOR\n\nThe grappling hook inches across the balcony floor, catching a firm\nhold against the stone.\n\nEXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOF - NIGHT\n\nThe nylon cord has been pulled taut - it disappears down into the\nblackness at a dizzying height, some four hundred feet above the avenue\nand crisscrossing traffic lights below.\n\nBlack-gloved hands take hold of the cord, testing it.\n\nEXT. SKY - NIGHT\n\nAn ominous BLACK SHADOW, cape billowing out behind in an eerie\nsilhouette, passes in front of the glowing yellow ball of the full\nmoon.\n\nANGLE DOWN CORD AT BALCONY\n\nThe balcony and double glass doors WHISTLE UP AT CAMERA at a dizzying\nspeed, growing larger by the millisecond!\n\nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe Burglar has finished his work at the safe.  He nods to the other\nBurglar who grins, then cocks his shotgun, pointing it down at the\nhelpless Couple on the floor.\n\nThe flicker of an outside SHADOW flits across the room - the Burglar\nblinks, wheels with his shotgun!\n\nSuddenly:  the double doors explode with a hail of shattering glass!\nAlmost simultaneously - the shotgun FIRES!\n\nINT. GORDON'S CAR - NIGHT\n\nA surly Gordon looks over as his intercom crackles.\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nCommissioner, this is Sergeant\nHavemeyer.  I'm on the fortieth\nfloor of the Gotham Arms.  Our boy\nhas struck again.  Cape, boots, hood\n-- the whole drill.\n\nGORDON\n(snatches intercom)\nWhen?\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nJust now.  The owners tripped a\nsilent alarm.  We responded and\nheard a gunshot as we were running\ndown the hallway.  The victims are\nfine.  Sonofabitch cold-cocked both\nperpetrators.\n\nGORDON\nAtta boy, Havemeyer.  Hold him for\nquestioning till I get there.\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nCan't do that, Sir.  He's...already\nleft.\n\nGORDON\nBut you were right outside the door...\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nHe left...by the window, Sir.\n\nGORDON\nBy the window?  Goddamnit, Man,\nyou're on the fortieth floor!\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nThat's...affirmative, Sir.\n\nGORDON\nYou get back to headquarters pronto,\nMister!  I want your urine checked\nfor drugs!\n\nHAVEMEYER'S VOICE\nYes, Sir.\n\nGordon slams down the intercom in disgust.\n\nGORDON\nMaybe it's something in the water.\nMaybe the whole city's on drugs.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT\n\nPolice SIRENS everywhere.  A squad car rolls slowly down the street,\nits spotlight searching the doorways and alleys.\n\nINT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT\n\nThe COP DRIVER yawns, turns to his PARTNER who works the spotlight, now\nnotices something.\n\nCOP DRIVER\nWhat's that?\n\nPARTNER\nWino...\n(out the window)\nGo back to sleep, Ace!\n\nSuddenly:  A WHISTLING SOUND through the air!  The two Cops blink, snap\ntheir heads forward as the searchlight is trained on:\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN - THEIR  P.O.V.\n\nTHE BATMAN! - Seen in his majestic totality for the very first time.  A\ntruly awesome figure from his black cowl to his gleaming black boots.\nHis huge, dark cape billows out ominously behind him.\n\nBACK TO SQUAD CAR\n\nCOP DRIVER\nHolee shit...\n\nPARTNER\nLet's get him!\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe squad car lurches forward!  Batman whirls, runs down an alley.  The\nsquad car swings, pulls in after him.\n\nINT. ALLEY - NIGHT\n\nBatman runs with the speed of an Olympic sprinter, but the squad car\ngains rapidly.  He looks over his shoulder.\n\nANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe squad car fills the alleyway.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nHe looks in front of him in horror - another squad car speed at him\nfrom the other direction.  It too fills the alleyway.  There's no place\nto hide.\n\nANGLE ON SQUAD CAR #1\n\nFilling frame - the Cops grinning.\n\nANGLE ON SQUAD CAR #2\n\nFilling frame - the Cops grinning.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nHe stands his ground.  Then - curiously - runs directly at the first\nsquad car.\n\nANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD - SQUAD CAR #1\n\nCOP #1\nWhat the...?\n\nBACK TO BATMAN - SLOW MOTION SHOT\n\nWith a perfectly timed leap, Batman vaults onto the hood of the car in\na somersault and does a complete 360 - up the windshield - over the\nroof - off the trunk - lands on the pavement with the grave of a cat.\n\nANGLE ON TWO POLICE CARS\n\nThey crash head-on with a sickening sound of crunching metal and flying\nglass.  Two groggy Police exit, front doors falling off, try to clear\ntheir heads.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAWN\n\nThe first orange rays of the morning sun stab upwards through the\nclouds over Wayne Manor.\n\nINT. YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - DAY\n\nYoung Bruce Wayne's lab room remains much as we remember it, except\nthat the gaping hole in the wall caused by the laser has been\nreinforced and shaped into a doorway.  A make-shift ladder-like\nstairway leads down into the cavern below.\n\nFOOTSTEPS are heard climbing the ladder from deep within the cave.\nAfter a moment, Bruce appears, stripped to the waist, still wearing his\nutility belt and the bottom half of his Batman suit.  His chest and\nstomach are nicked with small cuts and bruises from his previous\nnight's work.  His forehead glistens with sweat born of utter\nexhaustion.  He sits heavily on a cot, buries his face in his hands,\nlooks up suddenly as the door to the lab opens.\n\nAlfred enters, stares silently, first appalled by Bruce's physical\ncondition, then shaking his head with sympathy.  Bruce stares back,\neyes heavy with lack of sleep.\n\nBRUCE\nYou...think I'm crazy, don't you?\nCertifiably insane.\n\nALFRED\n(pause; smile)\nA bit...eccentric, perhaps.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's...what I have to do, Alfred.\nAfter all those years of searching\n-- it was always what I had to do.\n\nALFRED\nIf I may be permitted, Sir...\n(with difficulty)\nI've...never had any children of my\nown.  Never saw the advantage in it,\nconsidering my profession.  I've\nalways thought myself more talented\nat raising flowers than people...\n\nBruce looks up with a warm smile of gratitude.\n\nALFRED\nOh, I didn't raise you, Sir, I\nsimply watched you grow.\n\nINSERT SHOT - GOTHAM TRIBUNE\n\nA Banner edition of the Gotham Tribune cartwheels INTO FRAME:  On the\nfront page:  fanciful artist's renditions drawn from eyewitness\nrecollections of the Batman.\n\nOne is of a menacing black vampire with long, pointed fangs.  Another\nshow a dark, furry giant with huge feathered wings.  Above them the\nheadline:  BAT-MAN INVADES CITY.  MASS HYSTERIA GRIPS GOTHAM.  POLICE\nNO MATCH FOR WINGED INTRUDER.\n\nCAMER HOLDS on the newspaper as we hear the jumbled and excited VOICES\nof REPORTERS underneath:\n\nREPORTER'S VOICE\nCommissioner, how do you explain this\nFantastic phenomenon?\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nI can't explain it.  I only hope for the\npoor fellow's sake, he's sobered up by now.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM COUNTRY CLUB - DAY\n\nBruce lies on a deck chair by the swimming pool of the Gotham Country\nClub, his body coated with sun oil.  He listens to Gordon's TV press\nconference on a tiny transistor set next to him.  His eyes flutter open\nwith amusement.\n\nTV REPORTER\nWell considering the fact he apprehended\nfour criminals last night, shouldn't we\nbe calling him...a good Samaritan?\n\nGORDON\nSure.  If you feel like calling John\nHinkley a political activist.\n\nBruce's eyes suddenly bulge wider.  He gazes across the swimming pool,\ntransfixed by what he sees.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER - BRUCE'S P.O.V.\n\nA stunning-looking woman (SILVER ST. CLOUD) steps out onto the high\nboard of the pool, dressed in a daringly-cut shiny white latex tank\nsuit.  A shining mane of glistening silver hair cascades down across\nher shoulders.  She pauses, a shimmering white diamond in the sun.\n\nREPORTER'S VOICE\nCommissioner, it might surprise you\nto know that several polls taken\ntoday show more than eighty percent\nof those interviewed approve of\nthis...vigilante and what he did...\n\nSilver glances over in Bruce's direction.  Curiously enough, she seems\nto smile at him and wave.\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nWell I can't account for public\ntaste, bit I'd like to warn any\npotential copy cats who may be out\nthere that...\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce is stunned and confused, but starts to lift his hand to wave back\nwhen:\n\nTHORNE'S VOICE\nIf brains were bodies, she'd look\njust the same.  Can you believe it?\n\nBruce swivels, lowering his hand.  Thorne stands behind him, waves back\nat Silver who executes a complicated but perfect dive into the pool.\nShe starts to swim across in their direction as Throne grins down at\nBruce.\n\nTHORNE\nName's Silver St. Cloud.  Phi Beta\nKappa, Masters Degree in Political\nScience.  Just arrived in Gotham to\nfinish her doctorate on municipal\ngovernment and guess which City\ncouncilman drew her as an intern?\n\nBRUCE\n(staring)\nTaught her much so far?\n\nTHORNE\n(chuckle)\nNot as much as I plan to.\n\nSilver reaches the edge of the pool.  Thorne starts to help her out as\nBruce continues to start.\n\nSILVER\nThe water's glorious, Rupert.  Come\non in.\n\nTHORNE\nNever had time to learn how to swim.\nToo busy trying to make a living, I\nguess.  Not like Mr. Wayne over\nhere...\n(chuckle)\nRight, Bruce?\n(turns)\nSilver St. Cloud - Bruce Wayne.\n\nBruce looks up, totally mesmerized by the sight of her.  She gazes down\nwith a devastating smile, the sun sparkling off the beads of water on\nher face.  She is instantly and equally smitten as they lock eyes.\n\nSILVER\nPlease don't get up.\n\nBRUCE\n(lost)\nHmm?\n\nSILVER\nI said - please don't get up.\n\nBRUCE\nOh.\n(starts to get up)\nSorry...\n\nSILVER\nThat's all right.  I asked you not\nto, remember?\n\nBRUCE\n(stops)\nSo you did.  Thanks.\n\nSILVER\nDon't mention it.\n\nRupert watches them watching each other.  The uncomfortable silence is\nfilled by Gordon's VOICE from the television.\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nAnd now, if there are no other ques-\ntions, it's my birthday tonight and\nI have a formal party to get ready\nfor...\n\nThorne reaches down, turns off the TV in disgust.\n\nTHORNE\nThat clown has been a disgrace to\nlaw enforcement his entire career.\nThis city's going to hell in a hand-\nbasket and some imbecile's giving\nhim a formal birthday party.\n\nBRUCE\nIt should be fun.  I'm giving it.\n\nThorne raises his eyebrows.  Silver still stares.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nPerhaps the two of you would like to\ncome?\n\nTHORNE\nSILVER\nI'm busy, thanks.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   I'd\nlove to.\n\nTHORNE\n(irritated)\nSilver, I don't think...ah...\n\nSILVER\nIf I'm not being too inquisitive,\nMr. Wayne - exactly what is it you\ndo?\n\nBRUCE\nDo?\n\nSILVER\nFor a living?\n\nTHORNE\n(chuckles)\nYou're looking at it.\n\nBRUCE\nActually, Rupert's not being\nentirely fair about his...\n(nice smile)\nSometimes I go hang gliding.\n\nSILVER\nAnd that's it?\n\nBRUCE\nNot quite.\n\nSILVER\nI didn't think so.\n\nBRUCE\nI have a dog as well.\n\nSilver manages a tiny, unsure smile.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nWayne Manor.  Eight o'clock.  I'll\nhave my car pick you up.\n\nTHORNE\nWhy don't you take my car, Silver?\nIn case you want to leave early.\n\nSILVER\nI'm very flattered by the dueling\nlimos, gentlemen, but I can grab a\ncab, thanks.\n(nods)\nMr. Wayne...\n\nSilver excuses herself.  Both men watch her departure avidly.\n\nTHORNE\nGotham City's no place for a beauti-\nful woman to be travelling alone.\nI'm holding you personally responsi-\nble for her safety, Wayne.\n\nBRUCE\nDon't worry, Rupert.  I'll treat her\njust as if I were in love with her\ninstead of you.\n\nThorne's eyes narrow.  Bruce smiles ingenuously.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nDozens of expensive cars disgorge their passengers in front of stately\nWayne Manor.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nA lavish party is in progress.  A DANCE BAND plays off to the side,\nunder a banner reading \"Happy Birthday to the Finest of Gotham's\nFinest.\"\n\nBruce Wayne greets his arriving GUESTS, his neck craning around in vain\nfor a sight of Silver.\n\nGordon stands by the bar, downs a double scotch, scowls at GUESTS who\ntalks animatedly to him while flapping his arms like wings - doing a\ncrude imitation of the Batman.  The Guest howls with laughter, moves\noff as Gordon orders another drink and Bruce joins him with a\nsympathetic smile.\n\nBRUCE\nThey're giving you a pretty hard time\nabout that Batman, aren't they...\n\nGordon nods, tosses back his drink angrily.\n\nGORDON\nI'd give up half my pension to be\nstanding face to face with that\ncaped fruitcake right now.\n(looks off; stares)\nNow there's a sight to make an old\nman's eyes water.\n\nSilver St. Cloud approaches them, threading her way through the\nappreciative glances of the Guests, dressed in a sparkling, metallic\nevening gown, the light bouncing off it like tiny bursts of shooting\nstars.  She reaches Bruce, extends her hand with a warm smile.\n\nSILVER\nI hope I'm not too late.\n\nGORDON\nIn my case, by twenty years.\n\nBRUCE\nSilver, St. Cloud - this is David\nGordon, Commissioner of Police.\nMiss St. Cloud is picking up the\nfiner points of the city government from\nCouncilman Thorne.\n\nSILVER\nMy ambition is to hold a job as\nimportant as yours one day, Commis-\nsioner.\n\nGORDON\nThen you and Mr. Thorne already have\nmuch in common.\n\nSILVER\n(suddenly)\nWould you care to dance, Mr. Wayne?\n\nBRUCE\n(locking eyes)\nYou're as clairvoyant as you are\nbeautiful, Miss St. Cloud.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nNow heading into the driveway is a brightly painted version of an old-\ntime twenties paddy wagon, with two look-alikes of the old KEYSTONE\nKOPS riding on top.  They honk a comical horn loudly as laughing\nPARKING ATTENDANTS greet them\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - ANGLE ON DANCE FLOOR\n\nBruce and Silver glide smoothly across the floor - a perfect fit.\nBruce looks down curiously.\n\nSILVER\nSomething wrong?\n\nBRUCE\nYou're...leading.\n\nSILVER\nI asked you, remember?\n\nAlfred arrives, interrupting them.\n\nALFRED\nExcuse me, Sir, but there are some\noddly dressed gentlemen outside with a\nsinging telegram for the Commissioner.\n\nBRUCE\nAsk them to come in, will you,\nAlfred?\n\nBruce makes his way to the bandstand, whispers some instructions to the\nBANDLEADER.  A LOUD FANFARE is played.  All conversation stops as the\nfront door opens.\n\nNow entering Wayne Manor:  the Two Keystone Kops, in their twenties'\ncostumes with handlebar moustaches.  They dance their way to the center\nof the room in a prearranged routine, singing in harmony from Pirates\nof Penzance.\n\nKOPS\nWhen a felon's not engaged in his\nemployment,\nOr maturing his felonious little\nplans,\nHis capacity for innocent enjoyment\nIs just as great as any honest\nman's...\nOh, a policeman's lot is not a happy\none...\n\nThe Guests applaud loudly.  Gordon joins Bruce and Silver as the Kops\nbreak into a vaudeville routine.\n\nKOP\nExcuse me, Sir.  Have you seen a\npoliceman around here?\n\nKOP #2\nWhy no, I haven't.\n\nKOP\n(drawing gun)\nGood.  Then give me your watch.\n\nSeveral Guests laugh.  Bruce winces at the bad joke.\n\nKOP #2\nBut this watch isn't worth anything.\nIt only has a sentimental value.\n\nKOP\nWell give it to me anyway.  I feel\nlike a good cry.\n\nGordon laughs loudly as the Kop turns to him.\n\nKOP (CONT'D)\nNow, Commissioner, if we could\nborrow your watch for a moment...\n\nGORDON\n(taking it off)\nSure.  Be careful with it, okay?\n\nThe Kop smiles, takes the watch, dangles it from his hand.  Kop #2\nsilently sidles in behind Bruce and Silver.\n\nKOP\nHere's a good one:  what's a police-\nman's favorite way to kill time?\n\nGORDON\n(grinning)\nI'll bite.  What is a policeman's\nfavorite way to kill time?\n\nThe Kop grins, pull his gun - FIRES!  Gordon's watch is smashed to\nsmithereens.  Kop #2's gun suddenly at the back of Silver's head,\nhammer cocked.\n\nKOP #2\nUp against the wall, everybody!\nMove!!\n\nThe Guests scream as six more Kops burst through the front door\ncarrying automatic weapons.  Bruce, Silver, and Gordon are herded back\nagainst the wall with the others.\n\nThe KOP grins, then suddenly starts to giggle insanely.  He takes off\nhis helmet, as a shock of GREEN HAIR is exposed!  He wipes his lips\nclean which now become ruby red.  Cackling in glee, THE JOKER faces his\nvictims, his gaze suddenly becoming cruel and cold.\n\nJOKER\nOne at a time, your money and your\njewels, and no one's head'll wind\nup looking like the Commissioner's\nwatch, capisce?\n\nKOP #3\nHey, boss!  Look!\n\nThe Joker turns.  Kop #3 and a PARTNER have set Gordon's huge birthday\ncake on the floor, now wade through it, stomping up and down, kicking\nthe insides across the room.\n\nKOP #3\nWe're doing the cake walk!\n\nThe Joker giggles, then shoots a satanically maniacal look at the\nGuests who instantly begin stripping off their jewelry, taking out\nwallets, etc. as more Kops pass by with a gunny sack.  The Joker walks\ndown the line, stopping to level a searching and curious gaze into the\neyes of:\n\nBruce Wayne, between Gordon and Silver, his face set, eyes steely,\nstaring at the Joker.  His jaw twitches.\n\nSilver watches him, noticing the twitch.  She gives him a tiny,\nsympathetic smile, then turns to face:\n\nKop #2, who has moved down the line to Silver.  He looks her up and\ndown hungrily as she stares back in defiance.  His fingers slowly reach\nup to grip her necklace, then linger.\n\nKOP #2\nIn your case, lady, I'd like to\nrip the rest off and leave this on.\n\nSuddenly:  BRUCE'S FIST FLASHES INTO FRAME!  Kop #2 is knocked backward\nthrough the air as another Kop lunges at Bruce who grabs the gunny sack\nfilled with jewelry and bashes him in the face!  The Kop crumples to\nthe floor as Bruce wheels to face the Joker and sees:\n\nThe Joker, grinning cruelly, the barrel of his gun pressing up under\nSilver's chin.  Her eyes are welded shut with fear.\n\nJOKER\nNow that was extremely bad manners,\nMr. Wayne.  Especially from someone...\n(gestures)\n...to the Manor born...\n(giggles)\nSo why don't you rejoin the lady here,\nor if you like...\n(cocks gun; glowers)\nI can send part of her over to you.\n\nBruce hesitates, then rejoins the line.  The Joker lowers his gun,\nturns to stare at a painting on the wall as a Kop holds out the open\ngunny sack to Gordon.\n\nGORDON\n(to Joker)\nI'll see you rot in the gas chamber\nfor this.\n\nThe Joker smiles, ignoring him, looking at the portrait painting which\nis of a distinguished older man.  He removes it from the wall.  An\nindignant Alfred speaks up from farther down the line of Guests.\n\nALFRED\nBe careful, you clot!  That portrait\ngoes back to Mr. Wayne's grandfather!\n\nJOKER\nWhy?  Is there something wrong with\nit?\n\nThe Joker cackles, punching the painting out of its frame.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nBruce stares silently.  His jaw twitches with anger born of\nhumiliation.  Silver notices again.\n\nSILVER\n(whisper)\nLook on the bright side.  You're\nadorable when your jaw twitches.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Joker crosses to Gordon with the empty picture frame.  Another Kop\npoints a camera as the Joker holds the frame up to encircle his and\nGordon's face.\n\nJOKER\n(giggling)\nI've always wanted to frame a Police\nCommissioner...\n\nCLOSE ON JOKER'S AND GORDON'S FACES\n\nGordon shuts his eyes in disgrace.  The Joker howls with glee.\n\nTHE FLASHBULB STROBE WIPES THE SCEEN!\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nThe Kops exit Wayne Manor with their loot, climb back into the paddy\nwagon, roar out of the driveway.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nThe terrified and disgruntled Guests head for the door as Bruce and\nSilver look over at a devastated Gordon.\n\nBRUCE\nI'm afraid the tabloids are going\nto have a field day with this, David.\nNot to mention Rupert Thorne.\n\nALFRED\n(joining them)\nI tried calling the police.  The\nphone line seems to have been cut.\n\nGORDON\nI'll report it myself, Alfred.\nRight before I cut my throat.\n\nHe tries to check his watch, stares at an empty wrist, sighs, then\njoins the stream of departing Guests as Bruce looks over at Silver\nglumly.\n\nBRUCE\nWell.  Good-night.  I guess...\n\nSILVER\n(sudden grin)\nWhy don't be silly.  I've only just\narrived.\n\nBRUCE\n(smile)\nWould you care to dance, Miss St. Cloud?\n\nSILVER\n(offering her arm)\nYou're as clairvoyant as you are\ngallant, Mr. Wayne...\n\nEXT. GOTHAM POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nA crestfallen Gordon exits his car in front of Police Headquarters.\n\nINT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nGordon walks slowly and dejectedly down the nearly deserted hallway.\nAs he passes one DETECTIVE'S cubicle, the sound of SNICKERING is HEARD\nfrom inside.\n\nGordon stops defiantly.  The snickering instantly dies away.  Muttering\ndisgustedly, Gordon enters his office.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThe office is lit only be a small desk lamp.  Strung up behind the desk\nis a crudely-made banner reading:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO OUT COMMISH - FROM\nALL YOUR BOYS IN BLUE.\n\nGordon shakes his head sadly, crosses to a cabinet, pours himself an\nenormous glass of Scotch, then crosses with the bottle to the open\noffice window.  He takes a long swig, exhales, then slams the window\nshut.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nThe Wayne Manor driveway is deserted under the moonlight.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nThe band plays a soft, dreamy number as Bruce and Silver dance together\ndreamily, locked in each other's arm, drifting silently through the\nvast living room.\n\nCLOSER ON THEM\n\nSilver's eyes flutter open, then lock into his.\n\nSILVER\nMaybe you'd better take me home...\n\nBRUCE\nI am home...\n\nSILVER\n(soft murmur)\nYou see...I don't do anything on\nthe first date...\n\nBRUCE\nDon't be so hard on yourself...You're\ndoing just fine...\n\nHe draws her in more tightly as hey glide across the floor.\n\nEXT.

SILVER'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nBruce escorts Silver down the modest, clean hallway.\n\nSILVER\nThank you for a totally unexpected\nevening, Bruce.  I like surprises...\n\nShe stops at a door, inserts her key, turns, smiles.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nIncluding you.\n\nBRUCE\nOh?  How did...\n(smile)\nRupert Thorne describe me?\n\nSILVER\nAs a rather ineffectual playboy.\nBut pleasant enough in a harmless\nsort of way.\n\nBRUCE\nLike an affable grasshopper bouncing\naround in the middle of all you\nhard-working ants...\n\nSILVER\nSomething like that.\n\nBruce takes her hand gently, stares deeply into her eyes.\n\nBRUCE\nAnd you?  How would you describe me?\n\nSILVER\n(staring back)\nI don't think you're harmless.  And\nI don't think anyone who's looked\nstraight in your eyes could say so.\n\nBruce's jaw twitches involuntarily.  Silver grins.  He leans in, kisses\nher lingeringly on the mouth.  They break.  He gazes into her\ndisoriented eyes.\n\nBRUCE\nFrightened?\n\nSILVER\nTerrified...but don't worry...\n(soft smile)\nAs a kid they always had to drag me\noff the roller coaster.\n\nThey kiss again, passionately.  She looks up, confused.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nI sleep I'll get some think now...\n\nShe turns key, slips through the door, closing it again.\n\nBruce sigh, slumps back heavily against the wall, realizing a dilemma\nhe may never be able to solve.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SKYLINE - NIGHT\n\nThe yellow moon glows brightly over Gotham City.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nGordon is slumped over his desk, mumbling to himself in a half-drunken\nstupor.  The bottle of Scotch next to him has clearly been emptied.\n\nSuddenly - a gust of cold wind ruffles his hair.  His eyes flutter,\nthen look over at the open office window.\n\nGORDON\nThought I closed that Goddamn thing...\n\nHe staggers to the window, looks out sadly.\n\nBATMAN'S VOICE\nWhatever you do - don't jump.\n\nGordon whirls.  Batman looms up from a dark corner.\n\nBATMAN (CONT'D)\nWe've been at odds, Commissioner,\nand it's Gotham's loss.  My fight\nisn't with you.  It's with the dis-\neased scum infesting this city.\n\nGordon backs up toward his desk, smiles nervously.\n\nGORDON\nOf course it is...\n\nBATMAN\nCriminals are a cowardly lot at heart.\nBut human garbage like the Joker is\ntaking over Gotham - in spite of\neverything that you and other men of\ngood will can do about it.\n\nGORDON\nDon't you preach law and order to\nme, you...\n\nBATMAN\nThe people need a symbol.  Someone\nto rally around.  Someone who isn't\nhamstrung by the very laws he's\nsworn to uphold, whose hands aren't\ntied with red tape.  They have a\nright to justice.\n\nGORDON\nThat I happen to agree with...\n(pulls gun from\ndrawer)\nThat's why you're under arrest.\n\nGordon levels the gun.  They are frozen for a moment.  Batman advances\nslowly.

It\nframes the figure of THE PENGUIN who lies in bed, an ice pack on his\nhead, a thermometer sticking out of his mouth.\n\nThis is an elegant man, dressed in a white robe with a black collar,\npropped up on black silk sheets against black-and-white checkered\npillows.  A COOING SOUND makes him glance at a partially opened window\nwhere a pigeon has landed, now looks at him questioningly.  The Penguin\nmakes a clucking birdlike sound of welcome which the pigeon seems to\nrecognize.

The acetylene torch whines.\n\nCAMERA PANS:  Another section features a myriad of complicated machines\nand a fully equipped crime lab.\n\nPAST the crime lab:  Bruce lies on his back under a partially\nconstructed futuristic automobile.  He trains an acetylene torch\nagainst one section as the sparks fly.  It's just the shell of a car\nnow - other sections and odd electronic devices are strewn about the\narea.  Bruce shuts off his torch, removes a faceplate, reaches back for\na long cylindrical network of crisscrossing cables.  He starts to fit\nit onto one underside edge of the chassis.\n\nBRUCE\nI'm sorry, Alfred.

The bullet bounces off the blue wall of\nlight, then ricochets back at Alfred, pinging into the cavern wall next\nto his head!

It grazes down the shaft wall, catches on one set\nof gears which allow the doors to open on each individual floor.  The\nnylon cord goes taut.\n\nBACK TO ELEVATOR\n\nSilver hangs on as Batman hooks his arm around her.  The two of them\nshoot upwards through the escape hatch.\n\nANGLE ON ELEVATOR\n\nStill plummeting.  It hits the ground with an ear-splitting, sickening\ncrash.\n\nINT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nA WASHERWOMAN standing by the elevator doors, with her mop and pail,\npresses the \"down\" button.  It opens.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman and Silver hang by the cord in the shaft, her arms locked around\nhim in a death grip.  She stares, goggle-eyed.\n\nBATMAN\n(at Silver)\nNext time - remind me to try the\nwindow.\n\nEXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\nBatman and Silver walk down a deserted street.  She is a wreck -\ntrembling, ripped dress, with streaks of cable grease on her face and\nhair.\n\nBATMAN\nI'm parked in the alleyway.  Didn't\nwant to attract attention.\n\nSILVER\nA bit late for that, isn't it?\n\nSuddenly:  THE ROAR OF ENGINES IS HEARD FROM THE SKY!  Batman and\nSilver's heads snap up:\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN'S GANG - THEIR P.O.V.\n\nTHREE PENGUIN CONFEDERATES whizz down at them through the night sky\nwearing jetpacks!  Orange flames shoot out from behind their propelling\nrigs as they maneuver through the air, now heading into a synchronized\npower dive.\n\nThe Penguin hovers above, still supported by his whirling umbrella-\ncopter.\n\nA hail of MACHINE GUN BULLETS spews forth from guns mounted on top of\ntheir packs - the flyers close in on Batman and Silver like attacking\nfighter planes.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN AND SILVER\n\nBatman dives behind a row of garbage cans, pushing a screaming Silver\ndown in front of him as the fusillade ricochets off the cans and\nbuilding walls.\n\nThe flying formation zooms back up into the sky again, preparing to\nmake another pass.  Batman turns to a trembling Silver who is paralyzed\nwith fear.\n\nBATMAN\nStay here!  It's me they want...\n\nSILVER\nDon't leave me!!\n\nBatman turns and looks:  she is a quaking mess.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nOh, please?

A sleek,\npowerful, futuristic panther of a car - jet black with a domed\ninterior.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nThe interior is a glistening, intricate maze of computers, screens, and\ncomplicated electrical systems.  Silver's eyes are frozen open in\nastonishment.

There is one.\n\nANGLE ON SKY\n\nThe Penguin and his three Jetpack Bandits zoom down at the car, their\nmounted machine guns BLAZING.  Bandit #1 powers forward, spewing\nbullets as he comes.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nA succession of RICOCHET HITS on the Batmobile roof causes Silver to\nhunch over in terror as Batman flips a switch.\n\nANGLE ON BATMOBILE\n\nThe two coiled cylinders under either side of the car suddenly eject\nintersecting streams of blue light (the force field we saw tested in\nthe Batcave) which now bathes the entire vehicle in a SOLID BLUE GLOW.\n\nA new hail of bullets ricochets off the impregnable field of blue\nlight, zinging back up into the air in the direction from which they\ncame.\n\nANGLE ON BANDITS\n\nTheir face registering horror as several of their own bullets whizz by\nthem, narrowly missing!  They soar higher to avoid their own fire.\n\nBACK ON BATMOBILE\n\nSpeeding down an avenue along the side of the park.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nSilver looks over hopefully.\n\nSILVER\nI guess we frightened them off.\n\nBatman shakes his head, flips another switch:  A small radar screen\nlights up.  Three blinking LIGHT BLIPS are still following them.\nBatman suddenly looks ahead, eyes widening.\n\nANOTHER CAR heads directly at them, guns blazing!\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nI think I'll keep my mouth shut.\n\nANGLE ON STREET\n\nThe HOOD CAR swerves off the street into the park.  The Batmobile\nsqueals into a 180 and roars after it.\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN IN SKY\n\nThe Penguin watches from the sky with satisfaction.\n\nPENGUIN\nHe's taken the bait...\n\nHe motions two Bandits to fly off in another direction, then:  swivels\nin mid-air, points Bandit #3 down at the Batmobile.\n\nPENGUIN (CONT'D)\nThe tires, you Cretin!  Go for the tires!\n\nANGLE ON PARK ROAD\n\nThe Batmobile pursues the Hood Car through the park as Bandit #3 looms\nup from behind, guns blazing.\n\nINT.

BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nBATMAN\nDo you know what the number one hazard\nis on the American road these days?\n\nSILVER\n(weak smile)\nSurprise me...\n\nBATMAN\nTailgaters.\n\nANGLE ON REAR OF BATMOBILE\n\nThe trunk of the Batmobile suddenly pops open!  A giant horseshoe\nmagnet swivels, pointing out behind the car!\n\nANGLE ON BANDIT #3\n\nScreaming, wide-eyed, as the force of the powerful magnet spins him in\nmid-air and he is sucked into the trunk by his jetpack.  The trunk\ncloses on him, slamming shut.\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN IN SKY\n\nThe Penguin looks down disgustedly, then lifts his gaze ahead and\nbelow, into the park.\n\nEXT. PARK - ANGLE ON CURVE - NIGHT\n\nA Bandit watches near a curve in the park road as the Hood Car roars\nby.

Suddenly - A HUGE EXPLOSION\ncollapses the section of the bridge directly in front of it!\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nPlummeting down through the air toward the lake.  Batman works his\ncontrols frantically as Silver screams!\n\nANGLE ON LAKE\n\nThe Batmobile plunges into the lake!  A brilliant SHOWER OF BLUE SPARKS\nexplode across the water's surface as the vehicle disappears.  For a\nmoment, all is still.\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN IN AIR\n\nThe Penguin looks down, \"clucking\" contentedly.  His expression\nsuddenly starts to change.\n\nANGLE ON LAKE - HIS P.O.V.\n\nSlowly re-emerging on the surface of the lake:  The Batmobile!  Its\nroaring turbine engines propel it forward, now supported by TWO\nHYDROFOIL PONTOONS!  The makeshift craft speeds over the water at\nspeedboat velocity.\n\nThe Batmobile reaches shore, churning up chunks of mud as the pontoons\ncontract and the car bounces onto the park road.  The protective blue\nlight has been extinguished.  From either side:  two Hood Cars\napproach, machine guns blazing!\n\nBatman swerves the Batmobile onto the grass, roars cross-country toward\na park exit as the hail of bullets begins to make CRACKS across its\nprotective dome.\n\nANGLE ON PARK EXIT AND STREET\n\nThe Batmobile speeds out into the street.

PARKING BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nThe Batmobile roars around hairpin turns, ascending the levels of the\nparking building like a sportscar.\n\nThe Hood Cars screech after him, gaining speed.  They pursue Batman\nhigher and higher, threading the narrow openings through the lines of\nparked cars, tearing off side mirrors, doors, and fenders on their way\nby.\n\nANGLE ON HIGHER LEVEL\n\nThe Batmobile, reaching the level just under the roof, squeals around a\ncorner, catches the fender of a parked car, and spins out of control!\n\nBatman slams on the brakes as the Batmobile skids and turns to face:\n\nThe two Hood Cars, which have stopped so that they are completely\nblocking off the exit ramps, up and down.  The OCCUPANTS stare in\namazement as the Batmobile suddenly roars at them!\n\nINT.

Jet-\npropelled afterburners ignite!\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe Batmobile has reached the edge of the roof, now LAUNCHES ITSELF\ninto space in an upwards arc!\n\nThe two Hood Cars are unable to cope with the sudden void between them\nand crash head-on with a sickening crunch!\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN IN MID-AIR\n\nStaring in total shock - frozen in mid-air as the Batmobile arcs up\ntoward him.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nThe figure of the Penguin grows rapidly larger through the windshield.\nBATMAN HONKS AT HIM!\n\nBACK TO MID-AIR\n\nThe Penguin takes a panicked, last-second evasive action, diving low as\nthe Batmobile streaks by:\n\nThe white-hot turbine flames from the vehicle's exhaust crease the top\nof his umbrella-copter's whirling ribs, MELTING THEM INTO DISFIGURED\nCURLEQUES!\n\nThe Penguin looks up in despair as his umbrella-copter begins to spin\nout of control.  He gives a birdlike SCREECH, then zig-zags helplessly\nthrough the air!\n\nBACK TO BATMOBILE\n\nThe sleek vehicle completes its downward arc through the air and lands\non the roof of the building across the street.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SKY\n\nThe Penguin cartwheels end over end through the air, his umbrella-\ncopter sputtering.\n\nINT. RICH APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nDozens of GUESTS surround a lavishly decorated banquet table in an\nexpensive apartment.  A Bar Mitzvah celebration is in progress.

APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe Penguin crash-lands on the end of the banquet table, sending food\nand Guests flying everywhere as he skids along, clearing it, finally\nsplattering to a stop through an enormous pile of chicken livers into a\nmountain of cracked ice under a banner reading:  TODAY YOU ARE A MAN.\n\nThe stunned Guests hesitate a moment, then burst into wild,\nunrestrained APPLAUSE!\n\nEXT. ROOF - NIGHT\n\nThe Batmobile sits parked on the roof where it landed.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nBatman looks over at Silver who has fainted dead away.

SILVER'S HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nBatman and Silver stop at her apartment door.  She smiles at him\nthrough smeared elevator cable grease.\n\nBATMAN\nI'm...very sorry for tonight.  You\nmust have been terrified.\n\nSILVER\nWell, I've thought of a way you can\nmake it up to me.\n\nBatman looks at her curiously.  She suddenly kisses him, deeply.  He\nallows it, unwilling or unable to pull away.\n\nCLOSE-UP\n\nSilver's eyes open.  She knows - or thinks she does.\n\nThey break.  Silver smiles mysteriously, whistles under her breath,\nenters her apartment.\n\nINT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nShe leans against the door, sighs.  Could it be true?\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nOn the other side of the door, worried.  Does she know?\n\nINT. TV STUDIO - DAY\n\nThe quiz show The Joker Is Wild broadcasts before a live audience.

An armed Gang rushes in after him,\nholds Jack Barry and the audience at bay.  The Joker steps to center\nstage.\n\nJOKER\nGood evening, ladies and germs.  I\nJust flew in from Lost Wages,\nNevada, and boy, are my arms tired!\n\nHe giggles.

The audience stares back.  His eyes narrow.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nBut I digress.  You see, I'm in the\nprocess of developing a new series...\n(evil smile)\n...of killings.  All original, all\ndifferent, believe me, folks, you're\ngonna die laughing.  And there's only\none man who can cancel my little show\nthe Batman.  Because from now\non, each time he appears in public,\nevery time he's seen anywhere - one\nprominent citizen of Gotham will die.\n(to camera)\nI'm tired of fighting you, Batman,\nso the people are going to do it for\nme.

I can't chance it.\n\nBruce turns away in disgust, his mind racing.\n\nALFRED\n(sympathetic)\nWell...perhaps a night on the town\nas Bruce Wayne might be therapeutic\nfor you after all.  You do have\ntickets for the gala opening of the\nopera.  I was planning on using one\nmyself, but if you'd prefer a more\nlively and decorative companion I\nquite understand.\n\nBRUCE\nYou know what?

GOTHAM OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nDozens of shiny limousines disgorge Gotham's formally dressed ELITE in\nfront of the opera house.  Photographer's flashbulbs indicate that it\nis indeed a gala opening.

OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nA maze of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE mingles in the lobby, exchanging greetings\nand appreciative glances.

Archerd blinks in disbelief as the Crowd\nparts and Batman enters the lobby.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nFrozen.  He exchanges an incredulous glance with Alfred.\n\nCLOSE ON SILVER\n\nTotally taken aback.

Archerd swallows\nnervously.\n\nARCHERD\nYou're...taking quite a chance,\nshowing up in public like this,\naren't you, Batman?\n\nBATMAN\nThe way I see it, we're all taking\nquite a chance if we let a sick\ncriminal mind like the Joker paralyze\nthis entire community with fear.\n\nAn angry MUTTERING is heard from within the Crowd.\n\nCROWD MEMBER\nSure.

A stern-faced Thorne plays to his audience for all\nhe's worth.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nWhat the Batman just did was inex-\ncusable.  Perhaps even criminal.\nBut he's right about one thing.  No\ncheap hoodlum is going to intimidate\nRupert Thorne while I still have the\nsaliva to spit on him!  My ticket\nsays seat E-6, and that's where I'm\nparking my keyster for the next\nfew hours!\n(pause; low voice)\nAnd I call upon His Honor, the\nMayor, to join me in the audience.\n\nThe Crowd looks over to the side of the lobby:\n\nGOTHAM'S MAYOR emerges from a group of onlookers.  A grey-haired man\nwho is visibly terrified, he swallows hard.\n\nMAYOR\nCouncilman Thorne is right, of\ncourse.  And I expect every other\ndecent citizen of Gotham City to\nstand up and be counted.\n\nThe Mayor silently starts up the stairs to the mezzanine.  After a\nbeat, Thorne theatrically extends his arm to Silver who hesitates, then\nreluctantly joins him.  They start for the orchestra section as others\nin the Crowd begin to follow.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nWatching Silver disappear.  His jaw twitches.\n\nINT. OPERA MEZZANINE - NIGHT\n\nBruce and Alfred head for their box.  The Mayor approaches from the\nother direction, now escorted by Gordon and a phalanx of Police.

A loud ovation is heard.\n\nWIDE SHOT - AUDIENCE\n\nThe audience is on its feet, facing away from the stage, applauding the\nMayor in his box.  The Mayor lifts his arms in a victory salute.  The\napplause dies down.  The lights dim.  The Overture to I Pagliacci is\nheard, O.S.   CAMERA RISES past the Mayor and his party to the hanging\nchandelier directly above him.

With a magnificent voice, he\nreaches for a \"High C\", hits it strongly and purely, holds on to the\nnote.\n\nANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX\n\nThe Mayor and his party exchange impressed glances.  CAMERA PUSHES IN\nON the chandelier teardrop.  It trembles from the force of the High C -\nnow cracks.  The liquid drips down into the box.\n\nBACK TO STAGE\n\nThe sad aria is ending.  Canio is on his knees, sobbing.  He sings\npianissimo, milking every heart-breaking second.  Suddenly - O.S. - a\nchuckle.  Then the sound of laughter.  Canio peers angrily into the\naudience.\n\nANGLE ON AUDIENCE\n\nConfused, then irritated, as the laughter grows louder.\n\nANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX\n\nThe Mayor and his Party guffaw loudly, pounding their chairs in glee.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nBruce rises from his seat, concerned.\n\nBACK TO MAYOR\n\nTears of laughter stream down the Mayor's cheeks.

Panicking.  As:\n\nANGLE ON STAGE\n\nThe huge clown drum suddenly rips apart from the center.  The Joker\nsteps out, dressed as an obese soprano.\n\nJOKER\nWait!

Rupert Thorne appointed acting Mayor.  In the center of\nthe page:  a large photograph of the Batman with the caption:  A\nKILLER?\n\nINT. BATCAVE - WIDE ANGLE - DAY\n\nBruce paces dejectedly, a tiny figure lost in the vastness of the\nenormous cavern.\n\nANGLE FROM STAIRS\n\nAlfred watches sadly from the top of the stairs.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStill pacing.  Thinking.  He passes the huge crime computer, pauses,\nlooks down, punches some keys.\n\nANGLE ON COMPUTER SCREEN\n\nA series of CRIMINAL MUG SHOTS flashes across the screen, law-breakers\nof every variety, finally stopping at:\n\nThe face of the Joker - grinning down menacingly.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring back.  Face set.  Jaw twitching.\n\nThe screen suddenly goes blank.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nAlfred has turned off the computer.  Bruce stares numbly.\n\nALFRED\nSir, I...\n(swallows)\nPerhaps...this isn't the only way.\nPerhaps this is all meant to signal\na...a new beginning for you.  After\nall, you're an intelligent, enter-\nprising young man with every capa-\nbility in the world to...\n\nBruce puts his hand on Alfred's shoulder.\n\nBRUCE\nI...know you love me very much, and I'm\ndeeply grateful, but I wish you'd get\nout of here now, and leave me alone.\n\nAlfred pauses, then nods, walks off dejectedly.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nHe wanders through the cave with glassy eyes, passing a table near the\nBatmobile.  On it - a new version of the battering ram.  Bruce picks it\nup, smiles bitterly, carries it in one hand as he continues to wander,\npassing the crime lab section.\n\nSuddenly - he lashes out - sends the battering ram flying through a set\nof glass beakers filled with chemicals.  Swinging it wildly now, he\ndestroys a section of the crime lab, then sinks heavily into a chair,\nhead bowed.\n\nEXTREME WIDE ANGLE\n\nThe cavernous Batcave.  The tiny, slumped figure of Bruce.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - WIDE ANGLE - DAY\n\nThe hot noonday sun drenches the spacious grounds of Wayne Manor.  Seen\nrunning along a track cut on the periphery of the estate:  the solitary\nfigure of Bruce Wayne.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nAlfred watches from the window, concerned, as O.S., the TELEPHONE\nstarts to RING.\n\nEXT. RUNNING TRACK - DAY\n\nCAMERA CLOSE on Bruce's grimly determined face, oblivious to the\nrivulets of sweat which pour down freely.  His body is encased in\nseveral layers of exercise clothes, deeply stained by perspiration,\nthat turn him into a human pressure cooker.  His legs churn like\ndisassociated pistons.\n\nBACK TO ALFRED\n\nThe telephone continues to RING.  Alfred turns, still distracted by the\nsight of Bruce and answers it.\n\nALFRED\n(into phone)\nMr. Wayne's residence...I'm sorry, he's\nnot available...No, as I told you previ-\nously, I don't know when that would be,\nbut if you'd care to leave another\nmessage...\n\nINT. CITY HALL OFFICE - DAY\n\nCAMERA CLOSE on the door to an inner office marked:  Special Assistant\nto the Mayor - Private.\n\nThe door opens as Silver exits into her outer office, followed by\nseveral NEEDY-LOOKING CONSTITUENTS.\n\nSILVER\n...I'll take it up with Mayor\nThorne.  Gotham needs an effective\nnetwork of daycare centers, and\ntomorrow night's charity opening of\nthe circus seems like a good place\nto start.\n\nThe Constituents thank her profusely.  Silver crosses to her\nSECRETARY's desk with a hopeful look.\n\nSILVER\nAny luck?\n\nSECRETARY\nNada.  Mr. Wayne seems to be perma-\nnently...unavailable.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nWayne Manor seems deserted under the glow of the moon.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE IN POOL\n\nThe Olympic-sized Wayne Manor swimming pool is illuminated by the glow\nof outdoor lights.  In it:  Bruce swims laps, knifing through the water\nwith powerful strokes.\n\nEXT. POOL - CLOSE ON BRUCE - NIGHT\n\nBruce churns through the water, eyes glazed with a total single-\nmindedness.  His speed is Olympian.  As he tilts his head to take\nanother gulp of air, he suddenly stops dead in the water as he sees:\n\nANGLE ON SILVER - HIS P.O.V.\n\nSilver emerges from the darkness, her glistening hair cascading down\nover an evening dress.  She carries a wooden tray with two glasses of\nchampagne on it, smiles as she faces a stunned Bruce who stands waist-\nhigh in the water.\n\nSILVER\nYou know, Bruce, you simply must\npick up your phone messages.\n\nBRUCE\n(careful pause)\nIf I did - what would they say?\n\nSILVER\nThat we were supposed to have dinner\ntonight.\n\nSilver smiles, kicks off her shoes.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nFor some strange reason, I thought you\nmight suddenly have an evening free.\n\n\nBRUCE\nSilver...look...\n(with difficulty)\nI...hope you won't misunderstand\nwhat I'm about to say...\n\nSILVER\nThere aren't going to be any more\nMisunderstandings between us, Bruce.\nAnd I warn you.\n\nSilver slowly and calmly begins walking down the steps into the pool,\ncarrying the tray with her.  The water rises above the hemline of her\nevening dress, heading up for her waist as she advance toward as\nastonished Bruce.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nI can be a very determined person.\n\nSilver arrives at Bruce, the water now up to her chest, letting the\nwooden tray with the champagne float on the surface next to them.  She\nhands him a glass, takes the other herself, raises it, stares deeply\ninto his eyes.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nTo no more misunderstandings.\n\nBruce smiles in spite of himself, tosses back his champagne, then\nstudies her unwavering gaze carefully.  Flipping the glass over his\nhead, he suddenly pulls her toward him, locking her in a passionate,\nhungry kiss.\n\nThey finally break.  Silver purrs, whispers into his ear.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nThere...see what I mean about mis-\nunderstandings?\n\nBRUCE\nNo.  What?\n\nSILVER\nWell just now - a moment ago - I\nthought you were being rude, not\ngetting out of the pool to say hello.\n(looks down; grins)\nI didn't realize you weren't wearing\na bathing suit.\n\nINT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nBruce lies naked under powder-blue silk sheets.  A lovely hand comes\nINTO FRAME, gently strokes his cheek.\n\nSILVER (O.S.)\nWhen I think of how many nights I've\nreached across an empty pillow, hoping\nmy hand would find that face...\n\nThen - a shining mane of hair as Silver, also naked, wraps him in a\ntight embrace.  They kiss.\n\nBRUCE\nThere's so much to explain.  And I'm\nnot quite sure I ever can.\n\nSILVER\nI don't need explanations.  I just\nwant whatever it was to evaporate.\nto simple disappear...\n\nShe rolls over, looks at him carefully.  A Police siren is heard\nfaintly in the distance.  Bruce blinks.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nDid you ever meet him?\n\nBRUCE\nWho?\n\nSILVER\nThe Batman.\n(smiles)\nEvery time I hear a siren.  I think\nof the Batman.\n\nBRUCE\nI...ran into him a few times.  Here\nand there.\n\nSilver smiles down tenderly, studying him.\n\nSILVER\nYou know...that night at the opera.  I\nnever believed that the real Batman\nwould show up like that in public -\nnot when he knew someone else's life\nwas on the line.\n\nBRUCE\n(deadly stare)\nYou're right.  He wouldn't.\n\nBruce suddenly breaks eye contact, unsure if she thinks she's talking\nabout Batman or to Batman.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nYou...met him too one night, didn't\nyou?  Commissiner Gordon told me he\ntook you home or something.\n\nSILVER\n(smiles; remembers)\nOr something.\n(pause)\nWhat can I say?  He was dashing, re-\nsourceful, strong - very sweet in\nhis own special way - all the\nthings you'd expect from the Batman.\n(grins)\nThe next morning I told Rupert I'd\nfallen madly in love with him.\n\nBRUCE\nYou don't say.\n\nSILVER\n(penetrating gaze)\nAnd what's more - I told Rupert I\nwas sure that the Batman...had\nfallen in love with me.\n\nThey look deeply into each other's eyes.  Silver smiles.\n\nBRUCE\nI...think I'm jealous.\n\nSILVER\nI think I'm in love.\n\nThey wrap themselves in each other passionately.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM CIRCUS GROUNDS - NIGHT\n\nA billboard:  THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH.  Featuring - The Flying\nGraysons.  All new spectacular extravaganza - THE GLORY THAT WAS ROME.\nPast the billboard is a maze of smaller tents for sideshows, the\nhousing of animals, etc.  Past the - the big top itself.\n\nCAMERA PANS the arriving SPECTATORS, Bruce and Silver among them.  They\nare surrounded by mothers and children.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's almost immoral, you know.\nGoing to the circus without bringing\nyour own children along.\n\nSILVER\nDon't worry.  I've made plans for\nthe next time.\n\nBruce looks over, alarmed.  Silver grins.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nLighten up.  My sister has two kids.\n\nINT. BIG TOP - NIGHT\n\nA major parade (The Glory That Was Rome) is filing out.  Pretty GIRLS\nin togas ride elephants.

She\nmunches on cotton candy.\n\nANGLE ON BIG TOP ENTRANCE\n\nA dozen CLOWNS of every shape and variety run into the arena, squirting\nwater at each other through toy guns, roughhousing, doing pratfalls,\netc., all to the delight of the Crowd.\n\nANGLE INTO ARENA FROM TUNNEL\n\nInside an entrance tunnel, CAMERA HOLDS behind the outline of a black-\ncowled head with pointed ears!  The head lowers OUT OF FRAME, then\nreappears, this time covered by a CLOWN MASK!\n\nThe Clown Figure hurries out of the tunnel, wearing a floor-lengthed\ngranny dress.\n\nBACK TO ARENA\n\nSeveral of the other Clowns have dispersed, running up into the\naudience as a DRUM ROLL is heard.  The Granny Clown edges over toward\nthe cage containing the big cats.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nOne Clown runs up the aisle past them with what seems to be a bucket of\nwater, spots Silver, flings the contents of the bucket at her!  Bruce\nand Silver flinch as a SHOWER OF CONFETTI blankets them to general\nlaughter and applause.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nNow let me direct your attention to\nthe trapeze and high wire.  Out\nstars of the evening - The Flying\nGraysons!\n\nANGLE ON GRAYSONS\n\nA family of aerialists.  The older Graysons, trim and athletic, stand\non one platform.  Their son, DICK, stands on the other.  He is in his\nmiddle teens, a handsome young man in immaculate physical shape.  He\ntakes hold of a trapeze, swings down.\n\nANGLE ON STANDS\n\nThe Clown who poured the confetti on Bruce and Silver watches through\npancake makeup with more than a passing interest.  Protruding from\nunderneath a large silly hat:  we see the edges of a startling green\nshock of hair.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nDick Grayson swings on the trapeze in a long, powerful arc, executes a\ndifficult flip into the arms of his father.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBRUCE\nRemarkable.  That young boy's one of\nthe greatest natural aerialists I've\never seen.\n\nSILVER\nOh?  I didn't realize you were so\nfamiliar with the sport.\n\nSilver gives Bruce a sideways look which he avoids.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nAnd now Dick Grayson will attempt to\nperform the incredible \"Quadruple!\"\nWithout a net!  He is the only flier\nin the world to accomplish this feet!\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nA DRUM ROLL is heard.  Dick swings down, picking up momentum, then back\nup, then down again.  On his third pass, he tries it:  revolves\ndizzyingly - MAKING FOUR COMPLETE SOMERSAULTS IN MID-AIR!  (Note:\nThere is, actually, only one person in the world who can do this, with\nRingling Bros.)  Dick completes the impossible feat to wild applause.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nOn their feet, applauding enthusiastically with the Crowd.\n\nANGLE ON CLOWN (JOKER)\n\nThe Clown (Joker) giggles under his breath, lifts one billowing sleeve\nof his oversized costume, begins to unbutton it.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nThe Graysons will now perform their\nworld-famous maneuver on the high-\nwire - passing each other and\nexchanging positions - all without\na net!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nBoth starring up, wide-eyed.\n\nANGLE ON GRAYSONS\n\nThe older Graysons stand at either end of a high wire some seventy feet\noff the ground.  They each hold a long balancing pole, now start\nforward toward each other.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nDick looks up from below, nervous but proud.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nThe slightest vibration - the\ntiniest misstep - could send them\nboth plunging to their death.\n\nBACK TO GRAYSONS\n\nInching forward toward each other along the taut wire, using their\nbalancing poles for support.\n\nANGLE ON JOKER\n\nAll eyes are riveted on the Graysons.  The Joker opens the billowing\nsleeve of his clown costume.  Popping out:  A LIVE FALCON.  It\nhesitates, then takes off!\n\nBACK TO GRAYSONS\n\nThey're face to face now, on the wire, preparing to pass each other\nabove the hushed Crowd.  Suddenly - the falcon flies into view, lands\nheavily on one end of the male Grayson's pole with a SHRIEK!  The\nsurprised man teeters - the wire trembles - the falcon suddenly flies\nat his face!  Both Grayson's tumble off the wire together, plummet\ndownward.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nAs his parents hit the ground heavily in front of him.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nSilver screams in horror.  Bruce stares unbelievingly.\n\nANGLE NEAR BIG CAT CAGE\n\nSuddenly:  the Granny Clown standing by the big cat cage rips his mask\naway!  The dress falls to the ground, revealing:\n\nTHE BATMAN!\n\nQUICK CUTS\n\n1. The Crowd gasps.\n\n2. Bruce gapes in disbelief as Silver watches him.\n\n3. Dick Grayson looks over from the bodies of his parents.\n\n4. The Joker grins.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nThe Batman stares coldly, speaks in a icily clear voice.\n\nBATMAN\nI've risked my life to help this\ncity.  I stood up for what I knew\nwas right because I thought you\npeople were willing to stand with\nme.  Well, now you can pay for your\ncowardice.  Now I don't care how\nmany have to die.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE AND CROWD\n\nAn angry MURMURING rumbles through the Crowd.\n\nCROWD #1\nCROWD #2\n\t\t  Stop him!\nDon't let him get away!\n\nBruce vaults into the aisle, lunges down the steps after the fake\nBatman as:\n\nCLOSE ON JOKER\n\nThe Joker takes off his huge clown nose, throws it into the arena - a\ngiant smoke bomb!\n\nAll over the arena, OTHER CLOWNS follow suit.  The big top has become a\nscene of impenetrable chaos as:\n\nTHE FAKE BATMAN OPENS THE DOOR TO THE BIG CATS CAGE!  Lions, tigers, et\nal., bound off their perches for freedom, rushing out of the cage to\nthe SCREAMS of the Crowd.\n\nThe fake Batman disappears into an enveloping wall of smoke.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nKnifing his way through the panicked Spectators, lunging through the\nsmoke after the fake Batman.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nSilver stumbles after Bruce through the pandemonium, reaching the empty\ncat cage, gasping for breath with teary eyes.\n\nSILVER\nBruce...?  Bruce!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nNearby.  Spotting her.  Eyes widening in horror!\n\nBRUCE\nSilver, look out!\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nA HUGE TIGER SNARLS, preparing to spring at her!  It launches itself\ninto mid-air as:\n\nBruce flies at Silver from the other direction, pulling her down to the\nground as the enormous cat sails over them, banging its head into the\ncage bars, knocking itself senseless.\n\nBruce pulls Silver to her feet, wraps a protective arm around her,\nleads her off through the smoky panic and confusion.\n\nANGLE ON DICK GRAYSON\n\nDick kneels protectively over the bodies of his parents, oblivious to\nthe insanity around him.  Spectators and Animals rush past in all\ndirections as he removes his aerialist's cape, then gently covers the\nfaces of his Mother and Father.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.

Dazed PATRONS mill\naround looking for lost family members.\n\nANGLE NEAR BIG TOP ENTRANCE\n\nSilver emerges from a medical tent marked by a red cross, sporting a\nheavily bandaged hand.  She spots Alfred and the Rolls Royce near the\nentrance to the big top, walks over.\n\nSILVER\nThe doctor says no more crap games\nfor a week or so, Alfred...\n(stops; looks)\nWhere's Bruce?\n\nALFRED\n(hesitantly)\nMr. Wayne wondered...if you'd be good\nenough to let me drive you home.\n\nSILVER\nDrive me...\n\nShe looks off into the big top:\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE - HER P.O.V.\n\nBruce stands motionless in the dark shadows at one end of the tent.  He\nstares across the arena:\n\nANGLE ON DICK - BRUCE'S P.O.V.\n\nDick Grayson sits alone in the corner, head bowed.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce's eyes are filled with tears.\n\nBACK TO SILVER\n\nSilver watches, somehow feeling the deep significance of the moment\nwithout the specifics.  She turns to Alfred quietly, nods, gets in the\ncar.\n\nINT. TENT - CLOSE ON DICK\n\nDick is slumped, his head still bowed.  Tears roll down his cheeks.\nSuddenly - a dark shadow inches across his face, almost blacking it\nout.  He looks up.\n\nBruce stands over him, peering down, looking deeply into him with a\nmesmerizing stare.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat will you do now, son?\n\nDICK\nI...don't know.  They were my only\nfamily.  I...I...\n\nHe bursts into tears.  Bruce grabs him, holds him tightly.\n\nBRUCE\nI know exactly how you feel, son.\nYou may not believe that - but I do.\n\nBruce gazes down darkly, almost hypnotically, his eyes revealing the\ntruth.  Dick looks up slowly, riveted.\n\nSuddenly:  WE HEAR the sound of ANGRY MURMURING from a CROWD - then,\nthe RAPPING of a Judge's gavel, silencing them.\n\nINT. GOTHAM COURTHOUSE - DAY\n\nCAMERA PANS DOWN from the symbol of Justice with her scales, painted on\nthe Gotham Courthouse ceiling.\n\nJUDGE (O.S.)\nI find you guilty of wanton negli-\ngence against society.

The witness chair is also\nempty.  Alone at the prosecution table - Rupert Thorne.\n\nJUDGE (CONT'D)\nOf usurping the authority of those\nlegally sworn in to uphold law and\norder.  The time has come to be rid\nof you and your reckless vigilantism.\n\nBruce and Gordon sit in the front row.  Bruce's eyes reveal more\nemotion than he would care to.

A once-\nadmired champion of the people has\nnow become a threat to their very\nexistence.  A lethal weapon dealing\nin indiscriminate death.  Therefore,\nto prevent further carnage, I've in-\nstructed Commissioner Gordon and his\ndepartment to bring in the Batman by\nwhatever means necessary.\n\nThorne sits.  The stunned Spectators begin to murmur loudly.\n\nGORDON\nThe Batman.  A killer.  Who'd\nbelieve it...?\nBRUCE\nI still don't.\n\nGORDON\nBruce I deal in facts.  And the simple\nfact is - you're looking at one poor\nsonofabitch who made a deal with the\ndevil.\n\nBruce stares blankly at the witness chair.  The Judge pounds his gavel\nfor silence.

WAYNE MANOR - DAY\n\nAs Dick enters with Bruce:  the towering hallway of Wayne Manor is\nfilled with balloons and a banner reading:  \"WELCOME HOME, DICK.\"\nSilver grins down from the staircase.\n\nDick drinks it all in, slightly uneasy and embarrassed.  He wanders\ninto the enormous living room, unsure, visually adjusting himself to\nhis new, outsized life.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY\n\nCAMERA PANS ACROSS a fully outfitted trapeze and ring set on the lawn\nof Wayne Manor.  Bruce gazes up proudly at it, looks over to Dick for\nhis reaction.\n\nDick looks up at the apparatus somewhat apprehensively, then flashes\nBruce a self-conscious smile.  Bruce understands, claps a hand on his\nshoulder, leads him away.\n\nEXT. POOLSIDE - DAY\n\nDick lies sunning himself on a chaise by the pool.  Suddenly, a large,\nwet beach ball lands on his stomach.  He pops up, looks off toward the\npool:\n\nBruce and Silver laugh from inside the pool, gesture at Dick to come\nand join them.  He gives them a half-hearted smile, shakes his head,\nthen tosses the ball back.\n\nSilver looks at Bruce with concern.\n\nINT.

You've been wonder-\nful to me.  It's my fault you've\nhad to try so hard.  It's...\n(eyes misting)\nIt's just that I still hurt so much\nsometimes...and then I remember, and\nI get so filled with...hate again.\n\nBRUCE\nHate?\n\nDick's eyes harden.  His face sets with a cold look, not unlike that of\na young Bruce Wayne when he faced Joe Chill.\n\nDICK\nI made a promise to myself the day my\nparents died.  A promise that someday\n-- somehow - I'm going to keep.\n\nBruce's eyes flick over carefully.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat did you promise?\n\nDICK\nI'm going to kill the Batman.\n\nThere is a long silence.  Bruce smiles tentatively.\n\nBRUCE\nThat's a pretty tall order.\n\nDICK\nWe'll see.  I have the rest of my\nlife to get it done.\n\nBRUCE\nWhat if he's...skipped town?  Given\nthe whole thing up?  Died, even.  No\none ever knew who he was in the\nfirst place.  You can't dedicate\nyour whole life to killing a ghost.\n\nDICK\nI thought you'd understand when you\ntold me how your parents were\nkilled.  Didn't you feel the same way?\n\nBRUCE\n(avoiding his gaze)\nWell I was younger than you are,\nand...\n\nDICK\n(pressing him)\nDidn't you hate?

But if you\ncan't live with my promise, accept\nit, support it, even - then maybe\nwe've both made a mistake.\n(eyes glistening)\nMay I be excused now?\n\nBruce stares back, deeply moved, almost whispers.\n\nBRUCE\nYes.  Of course you can.\n\nDick hurries out the door.  Bruce grits his teeth, crumples up his\nnapkin, squeezing it into a tiny ball.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nDamn.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM INTERSECTION - NIGHT\n\nRupert Thorne walks briskly down the street, hat tipped low over his\nface, coat collar turned up against the night wind.

When I decided to start\noff your political career with a\n\"bang.\"  Remember Thomas Wayne?\n\nTHORNE\n(cold pause)\nEvery time I see his son.\n\nJOKER\nNo regrets now, Mr. Mayor.  It's\ntaken me too long to maneuver us\ninto a position of total control in\nthis city.  I've got the judges\nlined up, the public at your feet...\n(cold pause)\nYou owe me, Rupert Thorne.\n\nTHORNE\nIt's a two-way street.  Once I\nrelieve Commissioner Gordon of his\nduties, you'll have a free rein in\nGotham - less my cut.  And now that\nit's legal to shoot the Batman...\n\nJOKER\nWe have to find him first.  So far,\nit's been like looking for a virgin\nin a maternity ward.\n\nTHORNE\nThen don't find him.  Let him find\nYou.\n\nJOKER\nHow?  If the real Batman wouldn't\neven appear at the opera to save the\nMayor...\n\nTHORNE\nThe Batman wasn't in love with the\nMayor.  He is in love...with a\ncertain young lady.

Once\nyou've killed Batman and made your\nescape - I'll call the police and\nrescue her.\n\nJOKER\nHer knight in shining armor.\n\nTHORNE\nSomething like that.\n\nJOKER\nI underestimated you, Thorne.  I always\nknew you were corrupt, but I had no\nidea you'd turn out to be such a\ndelightfully repellent human being.\n\nThe Joker cackles insanely.  Thorne spots someone coming, closes the\nslot, hurries off.\n\nAfter a beat, an ANCIENT WOMAN approaches the mailbox with a handful of\nletters.  She lowers the slot.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\n(outraged)\nDo you mind?  I'll never get these\npictures developed!\n\nThe Woman SCREAMS!  Her letters go flying up in the air as she hustles\ndown the street.  The insane giggle of the Joker trails off into the\nnight.\n\nINT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nSilver is dressed in a lacy, powder-blue slip, exits her dressing room,\ncombing her hair.  The DOORBELL RINGS.\n\nSILVER\n(crossing)\nWho is it?\n\nVOICE\n(through door)\nGotham Florists, lady.  For a Miss\nSt. Cloud.\n\nSilver looks through the peephole.\n\nANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE\n\nA DELIVERY BOY waits, head down, holding a bouquet.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nSilver opens the doors slightly, sticks her arm out.  The Delivery Boy\nthrusts the bouquet in her hand.\n\nDELIVERY BOY\nSay it with flowers...\n\nSILVER\nWhat a surprise!...\n\nShe inhales the aroma of the bouquet deeply.  Her eyes become glassy.\nShe drops to the floor.\n\nDELIVERY BOY\nWhat a straight man!\n\nHe swings the door open.  It is the Joker.\n\nINT. POLICE HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nThorne strides purposefully down the hallway, followed by a reluctant\nSergeant Haley.\n\nHALEY\n...I don't know, Your Honor.  I\nmean, you're the Mayor and all that\n-- but I work for the Commissioner.\n\nTHORNE\nAs of tomorrow morning, no one works\nfor the Commissioner.  I'm relieving\nhim of his duties.\n\nThey have arrived at Gordon's door.  Haley is shocked.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI assume you'll be staying on, Ser-\ngeant - as a loyal member of the\nforce?\n\nHALEY\nI...hope to, Sir.\n\nTHORNE\nThen open it.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nHaley's key opens the door.  They enter.  Thorne looks around, spots\nthe red phone connected to the Batcave.\n\nTHORNE\nAnyone have the bright idea to run a\ntrace on this.\n\nHALEY\nYes, sir.  First day it was installed.\nBut all we ever got back was an echo\nof our own number.  Guy's amazing,\nisn't he?\n\nTHORNE\nOh, he's a crafty one, all right.\nThanks, Haley.  That's all.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nDick Grayson descends the darkened staircase, dressed in his pajamas.\nHe hears a NOISE, sees a light coming from the study.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR STUDY - NIGHT\n\nAlfred is tidying up the study, turns as Dick appears.\n\nDICK\nAll right if I make a sandwich in\nthe kitchen, Alfred?\n\nALFRED\nWhy certainly, Master Grayson.  If I\nmay be of help...\n\nDICK\n(grin)\nI think I can handle it.  Thanks.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - NIGHT\n\nBruce sits at the computer, runs through a criminal history of the\nJoker on the video screen.  He pauses, looks off.\n\nANGLE ON BATPHONE\n\nThe red Batphone lights up, then dies.  Lights up, then dies.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring.  Unsure.\n\nINT. WAYNE STUDY - NIGHT\n\nAlfred reaches to turn off the desk lamp.  Suddenly, the light from the\nlamp rises, then dies.  Rises, then dies.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThorne sits, Batphone in hand, waits.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce crosses to the phone.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred presses the button under the desk.  The bottom drawer pops open.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce picks up the phone, listens.\n\nBACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE\n\nTHORNE\nBatman?\n(no reply)\nBatman - if you're there - this is\nMayor Rupert Thorne.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce listens silently, frowning.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred holds the extension, listens in as well.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nNOTE:  THIS CONVERSATION TO BE INTERCUT BETWEEN THORNE, BRUCE, AND\nALFRED AS REQUIRED:\n\nTHORNE\nThis...isn't easy for me, Batman,\nconsidering what I've said and done\nwhere you're concerned.  But I love\nSilver St. Cloud very much - and I\nhave reason to believe you do too.\n\nBruce and Alfred react in their respective locations.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI...dropped by to have a drink with\nher tonight.  The door was open,\nthere were signs of a struggle, and\nshe was gone.  The Joker left a\nplaying card - addressed to you.\n\nBruce's face sets darkly.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\n\"Dear Batman.  Crime fighters may come\nand go, but I carry on in the Great\nAmerican Tradition of violence.  I'm\ncalling my little caper, Slaughter In\nSilver.  Sorry I have to run now.\nWrite if you get work.\"\n\nBruce's eyes narrow, thinking.  Thorne's voice begins to crack\nemotionally over the phone.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI...don't know where they took her\n...or why the note was left for you.\nI only know that Silver means more\nthan my life to me, and I beg you to\nfind her and save her.  You're her\nonly chance, Batman, I...\n\nThorne's voice dies away theatrically.  He hangs up.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce hangs up, stares coldly.  His jaw twitches.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred hangs up in the study, worried.\n\nBACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE\n\nThorne takes a deep breath, smiles, rises, exits.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nDick has made his sandwich, closes the refrigerator door, starts off\nfor the hallway.\n\nANGLE ON HALLWAY ENTRANCE\n\nDick enters the dark hallway, starts for the stairs as he sees:\n\nANGLE ON ALFRED - HIS P.O.V.\n\nAlfred rushes out of the study, heading for the living room.  He slips,\nfalls heavily, picks himself up, oblivious to the pain, rushes into the\nliving room.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nWatching.  He starts for the stairs, then stops, now curiously heads\nfor the living room himself.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nDick enters, look around in amazement:  Alfred is nowhere to be seen!\nHis eyes scan the room for any other exit.\n\nANGLE ON GRANDFATHER CLOCK - DICK'S P.O.V.\n\nThe tall grandfather clock stands against one wall.  A thin shaft of\nlight seems to be emanating from behind it.\n\nDick advances to the clock, looks down, puzzled.  It seems to be\nstanding at a slight angle away from the wall.  Exploring the edge of\nthe clock with his hand, he starts to pull back.  The clock swivels,\nrevealing:\n\nANGLE DOWN INTO BATCAVE - DICK'S P.O.V.\n\nThe Batcave - with all its trophies, computers - in all its regal\nsplendor.  Alfred is standing near the gleaming Batmobile, looks off\nwith concern.\n\nNow emerging from the shadows - THE BATMAN!  Dressed in his full\nregalia, heading quickly toward Alfred and the Batmobile.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nStaring down, his jaw slack.  Stunned.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - NIGHT\n\nBatman crosses to Alfred, who stares with deadly concern.\n\nALFRED\nDon't go, Sir.\n\nBATMAN\nPlease get out of my way, Alfred.\n\nALFRED\nSince when have you trusted Rupert\nThorne?  You don't even know where\nyou're meant to be going.\n\nBATMAN\nThe clues in the note were obvious.\nThe \"Great American Tradition\" line?\nThat's the name of this year's series\nof exhibits at the Gotham Museum.\nAnd \"Write if you get work\"?  This\nmonth it's on American writers and\nWriting.\n\nALFRED\nIf the clues are that obvious, they\nmust want you to come.  It's a\ntrap, can't you see that?\n\nBATMAN\nThat boy up there thinks the Batman\nkilled his parents.  I told him he\ncouldn't live his whole life chasing\na ghost.  What I realize now is - I\ncan't live the rest of my life\nbeing a ghost.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nListening at the top of the stairs.  Thunderstruck.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nBatman puts an arm on Alfred's shoulder.\n\nBATMAN\nIf I come back, old friend, I'll\nexplain things to Dick.  Tell him\nthe truth and have the Joker to\nprove it.\n(pause)\nAnd if I don't - take care of him,\nAlfred.  He'll be in much better\nhands than he has been in mine.\n\nAlfred silently steps aside as Batman enters the Batmobile, roars off\nthrough the cave.\n\nAlfred pauses sadly, then turns back, heading for the staircase again.\nHe looks up.\n\nANGLE ON DICK - ALFRED'S P.O.V.\n\nDick stands at the top of the stairs, staring down, grimly determined,\nhis face carved in granite.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM ROOFTOPS - NIGHT\n\nBatman's silhouette as he leaps and glides effortlessly across the tops\nof buildings.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\nThe deserted museum with the billboard:  GREAT AMERICAN TRADITIONS.\nThis month:  American Writers and Writing.\n\nEXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT\n\nThe museum roof is a network of vaulted glass skylights.  TWO THUGS\nstand on a surrounding catwalk.\n\nCLOSE ON CATWALK\n\nA sharp metallic \"ping\" is heard across the catwalk.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Thugs look up.  One pulls a gun.\n\nTHUG\nThe Batman...\n\nBATMAN'S VOICE\nCount on it.\n\nThey wheel.  Batman stands directly behind them.  He grabs the first\nThug, swivels him as the second Thug fires - killing his partner.\nBatman shoves the dead man into the second Thug, as both bodies crash\ndown through the glass skylight.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - UP ANGLE - NIGHT\n\nThe bodies explode through the glass, falling some sixty feet to the\nfloor.  Then - total silence.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStaring down through the broken glass.  Listening.  He pulls a tiny\nrevolver from his belt.  A barbed metal dart sticks out of the barrel.\nBatman aims it through the hole, fires.\n\nANGLE ON MUSEUM RAFTERS\n\nThe dart embeds itself deeply into a rafter.  Attached to it is a white\nnylon cord.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nSecuring the other end of the cord.  He hooks himself to it with a\nclip, glides through the opening in the glass.\n\nBACK TO RAFTERS\n\nBatman shoots silently along the cord to a rafter, lands gracefully,\nlooks down.\n\nANGLE DOWN ON MUSEUM - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThrough the dim, eerie light.  This exhibit (like the one including the\ngiant penny) consists of huge, outsized version of everyday items.  In\nthis case - the tools of a writer's trade:  enormous pencils, erasers,\nquill pens, fountain pens, ink wells, a ten-foot-high pencil sharpener,\ntall volumes of famous American novels, etc.\n\nIn the center of the display - a giant electric typewriter, some thirty\nfeet wide.  A huge sheet of blank white paper is rolled up on it.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStaring down curiously through the silent darkness.  His gaze starts to\nwander, then suddenly spots something.\n\nBACK TO TYPEWRITER\n\nA FIGURE attached to the typewriter now moves.  It is Silver, hooked\nonto the ribbon near the center of the page.  She moans, still\nrecovering from the effects of the drugs.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nEyes widening.  He hooks one end of a nylon cord to a rafter, launches\nhimself, swinging down toward Silver.\n\nBACK TO RAFTER\n\nA hand with a knife reaches out, slices through the cord!\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nNow plummeting like a rock.  He falls into the typewriter in front of\nSilver, his cape suddenly catching on something, partially ripping it,\njerking him to a stop.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe lights are turned on.  Emerging from behind or under the various\nexhibits:  thirty or forty GOONS.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman hangs helplessly from the circular element ball which prints out\nthe characters on the page.  His cape is caught on the projected edge\nof one of the giant letters.  He stares ahead, unable to extricate\nhimself.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nThe glaring lights have brought Silver back to consciousness.  Hooked\nto the huge ribbon near the center of the page, she suddenly spots\nBatman across from her.\n\nSILVER\n(horrified)\nOh, my God...\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nStepping out onto the end of the carriage - the Joker!\n\nJOKER\nI knew you'd drop in, Batman.\nYou're that type of guy.\n(insane giggle)\nGet it?  Type?\n\nThe forty Goons circle in around the typewriter.  The Joker nods to two\nof them.\n\nCLOSE ON SWITCH\n\nTwo Goons give a mighty heave, flip the \"ON\" lever.  A loud hum is\nheard as the typewriter activates.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nRupert Thorne hides in the shadows behind a large pencil box, watches\nthe scene.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nYou know, you're nothing to write\nhome about, Batman - but let's give\nit a try.\n\nThe Joker points a gun down at the keyboard.\n\nJOKER\nWhat letter could be hiding under\nyour cape?  A \"D', maybe?\n\nThe Joker fires:\n\nCLOSE ON LETTER \"D\"\n\nThe bullet hits the letter \"D\", depressing it.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nThe element ball carrying Batman shifts, hurtles toward the page with\nblinding speed.  It \"cracks\" against the paper sharply, imprinting a\n\"D\".  Batman's head has stopped mere inches from the page.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nEyes welded shut - terrified.  The printing of the letter has advanced\nthe ribbon.  She is perilously close to the exact center of the page.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nNot the \"D\".  Hmm.  The most common\nletter is \"E\"...\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nThe Joker fires!  Batman flies toward the page, this time nearly\nsquashed on the other side.  A giant \"E\" has been imprinted.  Silver\nadvances one more position on the ribbon.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nAn \"A\", maybe...\n\nThe element ball spins, hurtles toward the paper again.  It splats into\nthe page, narrowly missing Batman, pushing Silver along again.\nImmediately - another shot - the ball whizzes back, prints another \"D\".\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nI know I tried the \"D\" before, but I\nsimply couldn't resist.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe message on the page reads \"DEAD\".  The trembling Silver is only one\nletter away from being obliterated.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStruggling, but helpless.  His eyes flash nervously.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nAlarmed as he sees what could happen to Silver.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nI know what letter is hidden under\nyour cape, by the way.  It's \"B\" -\nfor Batman.  But you see, I've got a\nproblem.  If I hit the letter \"B\",\nMiss St. Cloud will die, and I pro-\nmised not to kill her.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nGrim.  Pulling a gun.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nTo \"B\" or not to \"B\"...That seems to\nbe the question.  Well, I suppose\npromises - like laws - are made to\nbe broken.\n\nVOICE\nI made a promise, too, Joker.  The\nnight you killed my parents.\n\nQUICK CUTS:\n\nThorne looks up.  Silver looks up.  Batman looks up.  The Joker looks\nup.\n\nANGLE ON ROBIN - THEIR P.O.V.\n\nDick Grayson stands high in the rafters.\n\nDICK\nI promised to wipe filthy crud like\nyou off the face of the earth.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\nShoot him!\n\nThere is a hail of gunfire as Dick flies down through the air toward\nthe typewriter.\n\nDick lands on the \"TAB\" key.  The carriage releases, shoots across the\ntypewriter, carrying the Joker with it.  He flies off the end, crashes\nsickeningly into the wall, drops to the floor, unconscious.\n\nDick bounces off the \"TAB\", flies across the keyboard, lands on the\n\"SHIFT\" key.\n\nDICK\nThat ought to give you a lift,\nBatman!\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nThe \"SHIFT\" swivels the element ball 180-degress to expose the capital\nletters.  Batman is swung to the front, grabs the carriage, pulls\nhimself up, looks down as Dick launches himself into a pile of Goons\nlike a human dynamo.\n\nBATMAN\nLeave a few for me, son!\n\nBatman leaps off the carriage, joins Dick in the fray.\n\nNOTE:  The fight which follows will be outrageous and thrilling, but\nshould look physically believable.  The Dynamic Duo will overpower the\ngang using the following elements and devices:\n\nA. Dick flinging Goons back into the pointed tips of quill pens.\n\nB. Batman lifting a fountain pen lever, firing a river of ink at an\nonrushing group.\n\nC. Both of them using springy, huge erasers as launching platforms.\n\nD. Oversized volumes of literature slamming shut on the villains.\n\nE. Enormous bookmarks and letter openers swung as clubs, knocking out\nthree or four crooks at a time.\n\nF. Heavies being hurled into huge, deep ink wells, turning them sopping\nblack wet, unable to climb out again.\n\nG. Dick bashing a pair of Thugs back into the side of the giant pencil\nsharpener.  They slam back against the \"ON\" button, activating it.\n\nDuring the chaos, Rupert Thorne has made his way down the typewriter's\nsteel bar which holds the paper to the roller.  He unhooks Silver,\nlifts her to safety.\n\nSILVER\nRupert?  What...\n\nTHORNE\nDon't talk.  Let's go.\n\nThe fight continues as Rupert and Silver run down the bar, drop off the\ntypewriter, cross the floor through the furious melee, heading for the\ndoor.  Batman rounds the corner of a giant book.  Silver spots him,\nstops.\n\nSILVER\nBatman?...Batman!...\n\nThorne yanks at her.  She tries to pull away, sees two Goons coming up\nbehind Batman.\n\nSILVER\nBruce!  Look out!\n\nBatman ducks, rolls, trips the Goons, knocks their heads together.\nSilver rushes toward him as Thorne pulls a gun, realizing.\n\nTHORNE\nBruce...Bruce Wayne...\n\nBATMAN\nSilver!  Get away!\n\nDick has bashed a Goon backwards - he careens across the floor, hits\nSilver from the side, knocking her into Batman as Thorne fires.\n\nCLOSE ON SILVER\n\nBlood spurts quickly across the lacy back of Silver's powder-blue slip.\nBatman hooks an arm around her, stares into her dying face, struck\ndumb.\n\nSILVER\n(trembling)\nI'm...right...aren't I...Bruce.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nHorrified.  He turns, runs.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nGiving chase.  Dodging bullets as Thorne fires at him.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nLowering Silver to the floor.  She's barely breathing.  Thorne's\ngunfire echoes through the museum.  Batman's jaw twitches.  His eyes\nflash with rage.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nDick rounds the corner of a giant prop some ten feet high off the\nfloor.  Thorne waits for him on the next prop - gun poised and ready.\nDick spots him, freezes.\n\nTHORNE\nI don't know what part you play in\nall this, kid.  But it's turned out\nto be a one-night stand.\n\nBATMAN'S VOICE\n(roaring with rage)\nMay God damn you, Rupert Thorne!\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nBatman has placed a huge, viciously sharp thumbtack in a giant rubber\nband pulled taut.  He lets it fly.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nThe thumbtack spears Thorne in the chest, topples him back across the\nprop - which is the giant pencil sharpener - he falls into the hole:  A\ndisappearing scream is cut short as Thorne is ground to death.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman kneels, cradles Silver's head in his lap.  Her eyes flutter open\npainfully.  She tries to smile.\n\nSILVER\nHello...Bruce...\n\nHe stares down, eyes filled with tears.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nMaybe...it's better, you know?\nI'd...just...get in the way...\n\nBATMAN\n(low whisper)\nDon't...\n\nSILVER\nI could...never really have you, and\n...I could never fall in love with\nsomeone else.\n\nHer eyelids tremble.  One of his tears hits her cheek softly.  She\nreaches up, gently caresses his chin.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nPoor...darling...you're the one...\nwho's...left behind...\n\nHer eyes close.  Her face relaxes, dead.  Tears stream heavily down\nBatman's cowl.\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nINT. MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\nCommissioner Gordon supervises the aftermath and cleanup,  The Joker,\nstill groggy, handcuffed, is yanked along by a COP.\n\nJOKER\nTake it easy, okay?  I get winded\nopening clams.\n\nHe is led away.  Gordon stares across the room.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman stands by Silver's body which has been placed on a gurney.  TWO\nPARAMEDICS cover her face with a blanket.\n\nBATMAN\nWait.\n\nThey stop.  He reaches in, pulls back the blanket, stares down at her\nface.  Gordon has crossed to join him.\n\nGORDON\nWhat a Goddamn shame.  You know\nwho's going to be really broken up\nabout this - Bruce Wayne.\n\nBatman turns, glances at Gordon blankly.\n\nGORDON (CONT'D)\nThey were real close, you know.  Or\nmaybe you didn't.\n\nGordon turns, paces thoughtfully.\n\nGORDON (CONT'D)\nBut at least you're back, I'm\nback, and all's right with this\ncrazy world for a second.  Now I\ndon't know where the hell this kid\nthey're talking about went to,\nbut...\n\nHe turns, looks.  Batman has disappeared.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - DAWN\n\nThe gurney carrying Silver's body is loaded into an ambulance.  It\ntakes off, red lights flashing, siren wailing.  The rising sun is just\nbeginning to crack the clouds on the horizon.  CAMERA WIDENS, STARTS TO\nRISE:\n\nThe ambulance becomes a tiny red dot as we now view the magnificent\ndowntown section of Gotham.\n\nCAMERA CONTINUES TO RISE, SHOOTING UP some eighty stories, then ninety,\nthen one hundred, finally revealing:\n\nWE DISSOLVE AS:\n\nThe dark, majestic figure of the Batman, standing on the top edge of\nthe tallest building in Gotham.  He looks down silently, cape billowing\nout behind him, a regal black prince surveying his steel and concrete\nrealm.\n\nNow swinging up and across from a nearby lower building:\n\nTHE IMPOSING, GRIM-FACED, COLORFUL FIGURE OF ROBIN!  Dressed in his\ngreen shirt, red vest, flowing yellow cape and black mask, he lands on\nthe roof noiselessly.\n\nBatman's eyes acknowledge his presence without turning.  Robin\nadvances, then stops silently, several paces behind.\n\nThe DYNAMIC DUO has been joined.  Both for now, and for the future\nadventures which await them in Gotham.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nTHE ENDEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1083365", "artist_names":

LyricsIf a fool like you could listen to a fool like me\nAnd if the leaves on the trees could stop shaking in the wind\nIf a fool like you could listen to a fool like me\nMaybe, baby, we could stop

prayer\nHe's sayin' hurry up daddy, hurry up because we're almost there\n\nI tell you, if a fool like you could listen to a fool like me\nAnd if the leaves on the trees could stop shaking in the

around to keep a man wide awake\nNow when the artist gets mad, he can take up his brush\nBut when the crippled man loses his faith, well, who's gonna give him a crutch\n\nI tell you, if a fool like

Gibb and Barry Gibb]\nSixteen people are waiting to get me\nHoping to take me outside\nI hear the sound of the snub nose behind me\nI went along for the ride\n[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]\nWind in my face and my bones they are aching\nMy soul must weather the storm\nI must run till my back it is breaking\nDesperately I must keep on\n\n[Hook: Robin and Barry]\n\n[Post-Hook: Robin and Barry]\nAll of a

It was addressed to Mr Reg Cox, the stamp on the envelope was Australian and it had been redirected several times: firstly \u2018c/o The Black Swan, Lewisham, London\u2019, but then someone had put a line through that and written \u2018Myrtle Cottage, Worthing, Sussex\u2019, and finally the GPO had written in pencil underneath, \u2018Try the village\u2019.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Australia \u2026 who did they know in Australia?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She picked it up again, turned it over in her hands. Holding it up to the light, she peered through the thin airmail paper at the letter inside. Of course, she wouldn\u2019t dream of reading it. It was Reg\u2019s letter \u2013 but she couldn\u2019t help being curious.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a name on the back of the envelope. Brenda Nichols. Who was she? Someone from Reg\u2019s past perhaps? He never talked about his war experiences, but perhaps he\u2019d done some brave deed and Brenda Nichols was writing to thank him \u2026\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a sudden sharp rap at the front door and Dottie jumped.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nervously stuffing the letter into her apron pocket, she opened the door. A boy with a grubby face stared up at her. \u2018Billy!\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Mrs Fitzgerald wants you, Auntie Dottie.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Billy Prior wiped the end of his nose with the back of his hand. His face was flushed, a pink glow peeping out from the mass of ginger freckles, and colourless beads of perspiration trickling from the damp edges of his hairline. He was very out of breath.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie smiled down at him but she resisted the temptation to tousle his hair. She knew he wouldn\u2019t like that any more. Billy was growing up fast. He\u2019d take the eleven plus next year and maybe he\u2019d be clever enough to go to grammar school. As he stood there twitching for an answer, she guessed why he\u2019d come. There was obviously some hitch back at the house and he\u2019d run all the way, keen to do an errand regardless of whether he might get a sixpence for his trouble. He was a good boy, Billy Prior. Conscientious. Just the sort of son any mother would be truly proud of.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018She says it\u2019s a pair of teef that you come,\u2019 Billy ventured again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Puzzled, Dottie repeated, \u2018It\u2019s a pair of \u2026 Oh!\u2019 she added with an understanding grin, \u2018you mean it\u2019s imperative that I come?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018S\u2019right,\u2019 he nodded.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018You can go back and tell Mrs Fitzgerald I\u2019ll be there directly.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018If you please, Auntie Dottie \u2026\u2019 Billy began again, as she turned to go back indoors. \u2018Mrs F said it was urgent.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie\u2019s fingers went to her lips as she did some quick thinking. Should she leave a note on the kitchen table and go back with Billy? Her mind raced over the preparations she\u2019d already made for the wedding party taking place the next day. Everything was under control; she\u2019d left nothing to chance. Whatever Mariah Fitzgerald wanted, it couldn\u2019t be anything serious. Dottie smiled to herself. People like her always needed to feel in charge. To Mariah, any slight hitch seemed like a major disaster. Dottie looked down at Billy\u2019s anxious face and her heart went out to him. \u2018Has there been a fire?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018No.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Did you see an ambulance at the house?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Billy frowned. \u2018No.\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018In that case, Billy,\u2019 she said, \u2018the message is the same. Tell them I shall be there directly.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Billy sniffed and wiped the end of his nose with his hand, palm upwards. He seemed rooted to the spot.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Off you go then.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He turned with a reluctant step. \u2018It\u2019s urgent,\u2019 he insisted.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I know, I understand that. It\u2019ll be all right, Billy. I promise I will come as soon as I can.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She watched him go back down the path, worried in case he walked too near the old disused well. Even though Reg had put a board over the top, and weighted it down with a stone, she didn\u2019t like anyone walking too close.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Billy\u2019s shoulders slouched, so as he reached the gate she called, \u2018Just a minute, Billy.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He turned eagerly, obviously expecting her to run all the way back with him. Instead, she went back inside and reached up onto the mantelpiece where Reg kept his Fox\u2019s Glacier Mints in a tin. She took it down and looked inside. There were still plenty. She\u2019d filled it up the day before, but he\u2019d been busy last night so most likely he hadn\u2019t had time to count them yet. Should she risk it? He could so easily fly into one of his rages if she touched his things. She could hear Billy kicking the doorstep as he waited anxiously, scared of getting into trouble. Should she? Yes \u2026 she\u2019d take a chance. She went back to the door and held the tin out in front of the child. \u2018A sweetie for your trouble.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Billy\u2019s face lit up. By the time he\u2019d reached the gate again, the treat was already in his mouth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018And don\u2019t throw the paper on the floor,\u2019 Dottie called after him. She chuckled to herself as she watched him quickly change the position of his hand and slide the paper into his pocket.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The clock on the mantelpiece struck five. She\u2019d better get a move on. Reg would be back home soon, another ten minutes or so. If she had to go back to the doctor\u2019s house, she\u2019d be there half the night. She\u2019d better tidy up her sewing and shut up the chickens right now. Reg would see to the vegetables after he\u2019d had his tea. With all the rain they\u2019d had lately, they might not even need watering. According to the wireless, 1951 had seen the coldest Easter for fourteen years, the coldest Whitsun for nine years and, with the height of summer coming up, things didn\u2019t look so promising for that either. Everybody grumbled and complained \u2013 everyone except Reg. He didn\u2019t seem to be too worried.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018All this rain is good for the celery,\u2019 he said. \u2018And it\u2019ll help keep down the blackfly on the runner beans. Save me buying Derris dust this year.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie folded away the pink sundress she was working on and put it in her sewing box. The potatoes were beginning to boil. As she grabbed a handful of chicken feed from the tin by the back door, she turned down the gas and hurried down the garden.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie had lived in their two-up-two-down cottage on the very edge of the village for eleven years. At sixteen, she\u2019d come to live with her Aunt Bessie and now, nearly two years on from Aunt Bessie\u2019s tragic death, she lived here as Reg\u2019s wife. She smiled as she recalled her wedding day. How handsome he\u2019d been in his uniform. He\u2019d been so nervous, his hands had trembled as he put the ring on her finger. If she had been tempted to practice philosophy, Dottie would say that in life some are the haves and others the have-nots and, despite the sadness of the past, she was still one of the haves. She had come from nothing and now she had a nice little home, good health and \u2013 if she was careful \u2013 Reg was all right \u2026 Apart from the times when his horrible moods got on top of him, and he couldn\u2019t help that, could he? What was it Aunt Bessie always used to say to her? \u2018You make your bed and you must lie in it.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She opened the gate leading to the chicken run and closed it behind her, calling as she went. The chickens clucked contentedly around her ankles, clearly recognising her position as provider.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Chick, chick, chick \u2026\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She opened the door of the henhouse and threw in the seed. Most of the hens scrambled inside straightaway. She had only to coax a few stragglers to go in before she closed and locked the door. They were still noisy and agitated, but they\u2019d soon roost on the perches and quieten down. Satisfied that all was well, Dottie turned back to the house. She saw that Reg had arrived and was putting his bicycle into the shed. Her heart beat a little faster. He had lost some weight since his illness but he still had his good looks and his hair was still as black as jet. She paused, waiting to see what kind of mood he was in.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Got the tea ready?\u2019 he said cheerfully.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a quiet sigh, Dottie relaxed. Thank God. He was in a good mood tonight.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Of course,\u2019 she smiled.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018What are you grinning about?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She punched the top of his arm playfully. \u2018Just pleased to see you, that\u2019s all, silly.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something flickered in his eyes and she knew she\u2019d gone too far.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Oh, silly, am I?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her heart sank and she chewed her bottom lip anxiously. \u2018I didn\u2019t mean it like that, Reg.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she brushed past him, he grabbed her left breast and pushed her roughly against the back door. His other hand was already up her skirt, his fingers pressing into her bare flesh above her stocking top. His breathing became quicker as, with one deft movement, he undid her suspender. She felt her stocking slip. As his urge became more acute, he pressed his body against her and she heard a crinkling paper sound coming from her apron pocket. Her heart almost stopped. She still had his letter! Her mind went into overdrive. He mustn\u2019t know. Please, please don\u2019t let him feel it. Please don\u2019t let him ask, \u2018What\u2019s that noise \u2026 What have you got in your pocket?\u2019 She could feel it getting all creased up. If he found out, what would she say? How on earth would she explain?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was kissing her so hard she hardly had time to draw breath. His tongue filled her mouth and she could feel the rough stubble on his chin rasping against her face. She tried to respond to him \u2013 he got so angry if she didn\u2019t \u2013 but she couldn\u2019t. Her only thought was the letter.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The door latch was digging into her side and it took all her willpower not to push him away. Another thought came into her mind. He wasn\u2019t going to make her do it here, was he? Not here by the back door, out in the open, where anyone could come around the side of the house and see them? What if Ann Pearce looked out of her bedroom window? She\u2019d never be able to look her in the face again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Come on,\u2019 he said hoarsely, pinning her to the door with one hand and fumbling with the buttons on his trousers with the other. \u2018Come on.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Reg \u2026\u2019 she pleaded softly. \u2018Let\u2019s go inside.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He pushed her again, banging her head painfully against the door as he lifted his knee to prise her legs apart. All at once, he stopped fumbling with his flies and slid his hands over her buttocks. Her skirt went up at the back.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018No,\u2019 she pleaded. \u2018Not here, not under Aunt Bessie\u2019s window.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He froze. She looked up and he was staring at her coldly. His lip curled and he punched her arm.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Oh bugger you then,\u2019 he snarled as he walked into the house.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie grabbed the window ledge to steady herself. \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 she whispered. She stayed where she was for a couple of seconds, her knees trembling and her hair dishevelled. Lifting the hem of her skirt, she pulled at her suspender to secure her stocking again. The back of her head was tender but thankfully there was no sign of blood. She glanced into her apron pocket. The letter was completely crumpled. She couldn\u2019t give it to him now. He\u2019d go loopy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a deep breath, Dottie tugged at the front of her dress to pull it straight and held her head high as she walked back inside. She knew what was expected. Business as usual. They never discussed it when it happened. He didn\u2019t like talking. Five minutes later, her apron and the letter hanging on the nail on the back of the door, she placed his plate on the table.\nHe put down his paper. \u2018Got plenty of gravy on that?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Yes, Reg.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He got up from his chair and sat at the table.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ve got to go back to the house,\u2019 she said, aware that she was treading on eggshells.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Oh?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018She sent Billy Prior up with a message.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Won\u2019t it keep until morning?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I doubt it,\u2019 Dottie said, risking a little laugh. \u2018You know what she\u2019s like. She\u2019ll be in a right state. Josephine\u2019s wedding is the wedding of the year.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s anything left to do,\u2019 said Reg, pulling up his chair to the table. \u2018Not with you in charge.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She wasn\u2019t sure what to make of that remark. Was there a note of pride in his voice, or was it sarcasm? She decided not to ask and went to fetch her own plate.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Well, you\u2019d better get over there right away then, hadn\u2019t you?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018We\u2019ll eat our dinner first,\u2019 she said, adding her own note of defiance. \u2018She\u2019ll send the doctor with the car before long.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018How do you know that?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She shrugged nonchalantly. \u2018You\u2019ll see.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I dare say I\u2019ll look for any sign of mildew in the strawberry beds,\u2019 he said, mashing his potato into the gravy and spilling it onto the tablecloth, \u2018and then maybe I\u2019ll take myself off to the Jolly Farmer for a pint.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018So it\u2019s all right for me to go then?\u2019 she said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He looked up sharply. \u2018Got any brown sauce?\u2019\n\n\nJust as she\u2019d predicted, Dr Fitzgerald, a small man with a shock of frizzy light brown hair, walked up the path about twenty minutes later. Pushing his thick-rimmed glasses further up his nose, he curled his top lip at the same time, something he always did when he was slightly embarrassed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr Fitzgerald had always admired the simplicity of Dottie\u2019s little cottage. Reg kept the garden looking immaculate. The neat rows of carrots, cabbages, beans and peas kept the two of them well fed and healthy. He knew from the various occasions when he\u2019d been called out when Reg was ill that the inside of the cottage was neat and tidy too.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some would say he was nosy but the doctor made it his business to know all about his patients. Taking umpteen cups of tea by the fireside had enabled him to discover that, born and raised a gentlewoman in the last century, Elizabeth Thornton, known to everyone as Aunt Bessie and the original owner of Myrtle Cottage, had incurred the wrath of her father by marrying beneath her station. Cut off from the rest of the family, she and her beloved Samuel had amassed a tidy fortune in the twenties and thirties by running a string of small hotels, but sadly they remained childless. The frequency of the doctor\u2019s visits had increased slightly in 1940, when her only living relative, orphaned by the Blitz, had come to live in the village. A terrible thing to happen to a young girl, but he couldn\u2019t be sorry: Dottie had brought a very welcome ray of sunshine back into Bessie\u2019s life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He found the back door open. In the small scullery, Dottie\u2019s pots and pans gleamed and glinted. He wondered vaguely where she found the time. He was well aware that she was in great demand in the village. On Mondays and Tuesdays, she worked for Janet Cooper, owner and proprietor of the general store in the village, and on Thursdays and Fridays she was at his own house. Dottie wasn\u2019t the usual sort of daily help, all frumpy and with wrinkled stockings \u2013 she was attractive too. Damned attractive. Her figure was trim and her breasts soft and round. If she had one fault, it was that she wore her copper-coloured hair too tightly pulled back in a rather severe-looking bun, but now and then a tendril of hair would work itself loose and fall over her small forehead. He wasn\u2019t supposed to, but he noticed things like that. And when she laughed, her clear blue eyes shone and she lit up the whole world. He sighed. Oh to have an un complicated life like hers \u2026 to have an uncomplicated wife like her \u2026 Mariah\u2019s agitated face swam before his eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr Fitzgerald cleared his throat. \u2018We sent the Prior boy up, but we weren\u2019t sure if you\u2019d got the message,\u2019 he began apologetically.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie gave no hint one way or another. Oh dear, oh dear. He dared not return without her. \u2018Um,\u2019 he went on, \u2018my wife \u2026 that is \u2026 we wondered if you could spare an hour or two tonight, Dottie?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I told Billy to tell you I would be there directly,\u2019 she said in her usual unhurried manner.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I see \u2026\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I had to take care of my husband first.\u2019 Although her tone was mildly reproachful, the doctor envied Reg Cox \u2013 not for the first time. When was the last time Mariah put him first in anything?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Yes, yes, of course,\u2019 he said hastily. \u2018Um \u2026 I was just wondering \u2026. um \u2026 if you are able to come straight away, I could give you a lift.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Well, that\u2019s most kind of you,\u2019 she said in a surprised tone. \u2018I\u2019ll just do this and then I\u2019ll get my coat.\u2019 She picked up the bowl and wandered past him to throw the washing-up water onto the garden. \u2018And,\u2019 she added as she walked past him a second time, \u2018I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t mind dropping Reg off at the Jolly Farmer on your way, would you?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the doctor was annoyed by her presumption, he wasn\u2019t about to make a fuss. He wasn\u2019t stupid. He knew that in her quiet way, Dottie controlled all their lives and for the sake of his own sanity and peace of mind, it was important for him to get their in dispensable daily woman back to his wife as soon as possible.\n\n\nBy the time they arrived at the house, Mariah Fitzgerald was in a complete flap. She\u2019d got Keith running in and out of the house and into the marquee (a large ex-army tent set up on the lawn), with the large dinner plates from her best service, as well as some plates she\u2019d found on the larder floor.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Don\u2019t drop them, whatever you do,\u2019 she\u2019d screamed at her already nervous son. Keith tripped over the guy ropes and she almost had a fainting fit.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018You forgot the china, Dottie,\u2019 she said accusingly as Dottie stepped out of her husband\u2019s car. \u2018It\u2019s a good job I went into the marquee to check. The tables were bare.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie said nothing but she was bristling with anger. Dr Fitzgerald disappeared somewhere in the direction of the surgery and she heard a door closing. She hung her coat on the peg on the back of the kitchen door and looked around in dismay. She\u2019d expected interference to some small degree but not on a scale like this. Her beautifully organised kitchen was in total chaos.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs Fitzgerald had been going through everything, even the tins in the pantry. The lid of the tin containing the strawberry shortcake was on the draining board, the tin containing the brandy snaps had the lid from the love-all cake on the top and vice versa. The tin of butterfly cakes had no lid at all. Dottie couldn\u2019t even see it. When she\u2019d left that afternoon, the dinner plates, on hire from Bentalls in Worthing, had been in their boxes under the shelf in the pantry. They had since been pulled out and the shredded paper used as packing was now strewn all over the kitchen worktops and the floor.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With an exaggerated sigh, Dottie set about putting things to rights. The bread bins were open and some of her carefully counted cutlery was missing from the drawer. What was the point of asking someone to do something and then changing it the minute her back was turned? Mrs Fitzgerald usually trusted her implicitly. What on earth had changed, for goodness\u2019 sake?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keith came in and bent to pick up some more plates.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018You can leave them,\u2019 Dottie said tartly.\n\u2018But Mother says \u2026\u2019 he began.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ll deal with your mother,\u2019 she said, her tone a little less edgy. After all, it wasn\u2019t the boy\u2019s fault. He stared at her with wide eyes. She smiled and said softly, \u2018You go and have your bath.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I told her you wouldn\u2019t like it,\u2019 Keith muttered as he turned towards the stairs.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie set off in the opposite direction, towards the garden and the marquee.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have to do this, Dottie,\u2019 Mrs Fitzgerald wailed as she saw her coming.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018And you don\u2019t have to, Madam.\u2019 Dottie\u2019s tone made her employer look up sharply. There was no insolence on her face, but she needed to let her see she wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018There\u2019ll be so much to do in the morning,\u2019 said Mariah Fitzgerald. \u2018Why didn\u2019t you think to put the plates out? It would save such a lot of time, you know.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018They need to be washed first.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Washed?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I have no idea who had the plates before us, Madam,\u2019 said Dottie. \u2018I didn\u2019t think you would want to use them unwashed so I\u2019ve arranged for Mrs Smith and Mrs Prior to come first thing in the morning.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mariah Fitzgerald\u2019s jaw dropped slightly. \u2018Well,\u2019 she flustered, as she strove to recover her composure, \u2018the cutlery needs sorting out.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018That\u2019s right, Madam,\u2019 Dottie agreed. \u2018And I\u2019ve arranged that Mrs Prior will bring her little niece Elsie to do that. She\u2019ll polish everything for ten bob.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mariah Fitzgerald went a brilliant pink. The napkin she was holding fluttered down onto the table. She looked around helplessly. So did Dottie. She should have come sooner. Right now, she was wishing with all her heart that she hadn\u2019t bothered to wait for Reg when Billy Prior had knocked on the door. Now she\u2019d have to collect up all that cutlery, take all the plates back to the kitchen and tidy up at least forty napkins before she could go back home. She might even have to iron some of them again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Their eyes met.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Yes, well \u2026\u2019 said Mariah, patting her hair at the back. \u2018I have to be up very early in the morning. The hairdresser is coming at nine thirty.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018So \u2026 so I\u2019ll leave you to it, Dottie.\u2019 Mariah said, mustering what little dignity she could find. \u2018As usual, you seem to have everything under control.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie watched her as she crossed the lawn and sighed. It would be at least another hour before she had everything back to the way it was before.\n\nReg was all set to spend the evening in the corner of the Jolly Farmer with his pint of bitter. Usually there were plenty of people still willing to buy a pint for an old soldier, but tonight the bar was almost empty. He didn\u2019t mind. It had been a long day \u2013 Marney and the station master had had him running from pillar to post.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marney\u2019s chest was bad again. Too much smoking, everyone said, but Reg reckoned it was something to do with the POW camp he had been in Germany somewhere. You could pick up some weird germs in those places. Marney probably lived week in week out on the verge of starvation as well, and that couldn\u2019t have helped. Reg might not have been in a palace himself, but his \u2018rest of the war\u2019 was nowhere near as bad as Marney\u2019s. Even if it were  the ciggies that made his cough, who could blame the poor old bugger? He probably only smoked them to forget something.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Reg stared deeply into his pint, Oggie Wilson drifted back into his mind. He\u2019d never forgotten poor old Oggie, and when he heard what had happened to him, he\u2019d felt as sick as a pig. Reg never spoke of his own experiences of course. Better to let sleeping, and all that, but when he\u2019d married Dot in \u201942, he knew he\u2019d fallen on his feet. A nice little place right near the sea, two women at his beck and call \u2013 what could be better? Dottie had stuck by him all through the war and it was only the thought of coming home to her that kept him sane while he had been stuck in that bloody prison. He\u2019d finally come back in \u201948. She\u2019d given him quite a homecoming too. Some of his mates had come back from POW camp to find their missus had given up on them. Jim Pearce\u2019s wife had presumed him dead and when he came home he found her shacked up with somebody else. A fine how-d\u2019you-do that was, and the woman had no shame. Reg knew what he\u2019d have done if he\u2019d found any woman of his cheating on him. Not Jim. He\u2019d cleared off and she was still living next door, bold as brass.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie wasn\u2019t like that. Dottie had waited and she\u2019d been faithful. Reg took a long swing of his beer. Nah, Dottie would never do anything bad. She was perfect. Too bloody perfect, that was her trouble. Taking her on the doorstep would have added a bit of spice to life. Why did she have to go and mention the old trout? Bloody Bessie with her silly hats and passion for cowboy films, she ruined everything. Even the thought of her made his stomach turn.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019d had the shock of his life when Aunt Bessie had died and he\u2019d never felt the same since. It had done for his marriage as well. He\u2019d tried to get it together but he just couldn\u2019t do it any more. Before the war, he could keep it up for hours, especially if he knew Bessie was listening on the other side of the paper-thin walls. He was a bit rough at times but he\u2019d had enough women to know most of them liked it that way. But ever since \u2026 well, since then he just couldn\u2019t do it any more. Not with her, anyway.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie had never reproached him for it. She was too anxious to please. Sometimes he wished she would. He took another long drink. Trouble was, she never fought back. Whatever he dished out, she just took it. Well, that was no fun, was it? She was beginning to bloody annoy him all the time now.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Hey up, Reg. You coming outside?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He put his empty glass down and looked up. Tom Prior from the Post Office was leaning in, holding the door open. \u2018We\u2019re bowling for a pig,\u2019 he cajoled.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018A pig?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Nice little thing,\u2019 Tom went on. \u2018Fatten him up and he\u2019ll be a lovely bit of bacon when Christmas comes.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking in Tom\u2019s weedy frame, the thought crossed Reg\u2019s mind that he could do with a bit of fattening up himself. Naturally skinny, he and that fat cow Mary looked like Jack Sprat and his wife.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reg shook his head. \u2018Nah, I\u2019ll settle for a bit of peace and quiet.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Peace and quiet!\u2019 Tom chortled. \u2018You\u2019ll get plenty of that when you\u2019re in your pine box and staring at the lid. Come on, man. Let\u2019s be havin\u2019 you. I\u2019ll stand you another pint and it\u2019s only two bob a go. All in aid of the kiddies\u2019 home.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reg rose from his chair. \u2018I don\u2019t know why I listen to you, Tom Prior,\u2019 he grumbled good-naturedly. \u2018I never bloody win anything.\u2019\n\nDottie had worked hard and now she was very tired. The marquee was almost back to the way it had been and the kitchen was nearly straight when Miss Josephine, the bride to be, came downstairs in her dressing gown and wearing slippers.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She wasn\u2019t exactly a pretty girl. Her nose was slightly too long and her mouth definitely too wide; but Dottie knew that just like any other bride she would look radiant in the morning. Right now the whole of her hair was kiss-curled, each one pinned together by two hair grips crossed over one another. Her face was white, and the Pond\u2019s Cream, thick enough to be scraped off with a palate knife, hid every blemish on her skin. She was wearing little lace gloves so she\u2019d obviously creamed her hands and, to judge by the puffiness of her eyes, she\u2019d been crying for some time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Are you making some cocoa, Dottie?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I can easily make some for you, Miss.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie went to fetch the milk and a saucepan. Josephine sat at the kitchen table. \u2018Oh, Dottie,\u2019 she sighed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie was tempted to ask, \u2018Excited?\u2019 but the tone of the girl\u2019s voice led her to believe her sigh meant something altogether different. \u2018What is it?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Can you keep an absolute secret?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018You know I can,\u2019 said Dottie, striking a match. The gas popped into life and she turned it down.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m not sure.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Not sure of what, Miss?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018That I can go through with all this.\u2019 Josephine produced a lace-edged handkerchief from her dressing-gown pocket and wiped the end of her nose. \u2018I tried to tell Mummy, but she just got cross and shouted at me. Then she said she didn\u2019t want to talk about it because she\u2019d forgotten to do something really important in the kitchen.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ah, thought Dottie, careful not to let Miss Josephine see her lips forming the faintest hint of a smile. Mrs Fitzgerald had sent for her, not to sort out a few stray plates, but to stop her daughter from calling off the wedding.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie reached for the Fry\u2019s Cocoa, mixed a little of the powder with some cold milk in the cup, then added the boiled milk. She kept her voice level, unflappable, as she asked, \u2018What\u2019s the problem?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Josephine wailed. \u2018And before you tell me it\u2019s just nerves, let me tell you it\u2019s not.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Do you love Mr Malcolm?\u2019 Dottie put the cup and saucer in front of her, still stirring the cocoa.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Yes, of course I do!\u2019 She dabbed her eyes again. \u2018How can you ask such a thing? It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t \u2026 I can\u2019t \u2026\u2019 Her chin wobbled. \u2018Oh, Dottie, supposing \u2026\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Every young woman is nervous on her wedding night,\u2019 said Dottie sitting down at the table with her. \u2018But if you love him \u2026\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I do, I do!\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018And he loves you?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018He says he does. He\u2019s so \u2026 Oh, Dottie, you\u2019re a married woman \u2026\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie thought back to her own wedding night. All those old wives\u2019 tales her friends teased her with. They only did it because they knew her innocence. What they couldn\u2019t know was that their teasing fed her fear of the unknown, the fear of failure, the dread of being hurt. But back then, all her worries had been blown away by her feelings for Reg. Poor lamb, he\u2019d never known real love. He\u2019d never even known a mother\u2019s love because he\u2019d been brought up in a children\u2019s home. When she saw him waiting at the front of the church on her wedding day, her heart had been full to bursting. Now at last, she would be able to show someone how much she cared and as they\u2019d walked into her honeymoon guesthouse, her one and only thought had been that she would be giving him something he\u2019d never had before. Something very precious \u2026\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Haven\u2019t you ever?\u2019 she began, but one glance at Josephine\u2019s wide-eyed expression told her what the answer was. Dottie reached out her hand in a gesture of affection. \u2018Mr Malcolm knows you\u2019ve never been with anyone else,\u2019 she said gently.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018But I won\u2019t know what to do,\u2019 Josephine wailed. \u2018Supposing I fail him? Supposing being married doesn\u2019t work?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Of course it will work,\u2019 said Dottie. \u2018Even if it\u2019s difficult to begin with, you\u2019ll make it work.\u2019 That\u2019s what we women do, she thought to herself. Men pretend everything is fine or go down to the pub, but we get on with it and make it work.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Josephine leaned forward. \u2018Dottie \u2026. do you mind? I mean \u2026 would you tell me? What happens when you and Reg \u2026? Oh, I shouldn\u2019t ask that, should I? It\u2019s not nice. But what happens \u2026? I mean, exactly \u2026?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dottie glanced up at the clock. What should she say? If she told Josephine how things really were between her and Reg, there would be no wedding. Mr Malcolm seemed a nice enough man. A bit of a chinless wonder as Aunt Bessie would say, but he clearly loved her. Reg had been good and kind in the beginning. Her wedding night had been a little \u2026 rushed \u2026 but she knew he loved her really. It was only the war that changed him. All that time he was away, she\u2019d dreamed of what it would be like to have him back home again. It wasn\u2019t his fault things weren\u2019t the same. Aunt Bessie was right. She always said, \u2018War does terrible things to people.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Dottie?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Josephine\u2019s voice brought her back to the present. She leaned towards her employer\u2019s daughter as if she were about to whisper a secret. She wouldn\u2019t spoil it for her. She wouldn\u2019t tell her how it was, she\u2019d tell her how she\u2019d always dreamed it would be.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1702146", "artist_names": "DJ

show.]\n[Unknown 50 Cent song plays as images transition between a man getting dressed and the activity in streets. Chatting in the background as James \u201cGhost\u201d Patrick steps out a black limbo with his wife, Tasha Patrick. They watch as people are trying to get into the club.]TASHA\nTell me I'm beautiful.\n\nJAMES\nYou know you are.\n\nBOUNCER\nBoss is here.\nJAMES\n[As him and Tasha walk down an exclusive back hallway] Y'all hear that? The boss is here.[\u201cEscape - Charity Strike Remix\u201d by 3LAU, Paris & Simo, and Bright Lights plays as they enter the club scene.JAMES\nTo Truth!\n\nALL\nTruth! - Whoo!\n\nJAMES\nLet me make some rounds. Baby, I'll be back.\n\nTASHA\nWhere you going?\n\nJAMES\nI've got to handle some details.\n\nTASHA\nDon't you have people for that?\n\nJAMES\n[Laughs and kisses here] It's called \"customer service,\" Tasha. I do this part myself [leaves].\n\nTASHA\nExcuse me, more champagne, more vodka, more everything.\n\nLAKEISHA\nMm, wait, wait, hold up. Bring some Henny and bring some Patron.JOSH\nHead count's at four-hundred and it's not even midnight. Fire marshal told us to keep it under three-twenty-five, so if he shows up, we're fucked.\nJAMES\n[People dancing and cheering] - Place is fucking bananas. You might be worth the risk.\n\nJOSH\nI told you, that's all behind me now, and I delivered. This is the best goddamn nightclub opening the whole year. My whole database turned out.\n\nJAMES\nYeah, you know the right people. And it's bangin' tonight, but we stay in business if we keep the music hot, the women hot, and make it damn near impossible to get in this fucking door.\n\nJOSH\nEven for my VIP's? Come on.\n\nJAMES\nFuck your VIP's. We gonna redefine the word.[A red-haired waitress walks around the bar, past James, as she grabs more drinks. \u201cSuper Swag\u201d by DJ Godfather (featuring Lil Mz. 313) plays in the background.]\n\nSHAWN\nHey, boss, they want you downstairs.\n\nJAMES\nWho wants me?\n\nSHAWN\nTommy. Should I come too?\n\nJAMES\nYou wait in the car.TOMMY\nYou think you can fucking steal from me and then just walk the fuck away?\nMIGUEL\nI didn't do anything, man! She don't know nothing! Okay, look! Hey, hey, look! Hey, I stole from you. Okay, it was me. Look, please, man.  [Sobbing] - Okay, it's not her fault.\n\nTOMMY\n[Walks up some steps and points a gun at the girl, lying on the ground with a blindfold over her face] You're right there, Miguel. It's not Maria's fault. It's yours. You have your opportunity to make this right. All you have to do is tell me where you hid my shit.\n\nMIGUEL\nI can't. I can't.\n\nTOMMY\nHe's not listening to me, Maria. [Flips her on her side] Here, you talk to him.\n\nMARIA\n[Whimpers] Miguel, dile lo que hiciste con el dinero\n\nJAMES\n[Bust through the door] What the fuck is going on?\n\nTOMMY\nGhost, meet Miguel Alvarez and his fianc\u00e9e Maria. Cruz was driving his route when this motherfucker jumped him, shot him in the head.\n\nJAMES\nCruz, so he got\u2026\n\nTOMMY\nThe money! A whole day's paper.\n\nJAMES\nWe get it back?\nTOMMY\nNo. He handed it off before Victor tracked him down. Wasn't enough to kill him. This greedy motherfucker stole Cruz's phone, led us right to his place. Found him in bed with her. Moron thought he was home free, about to have his celebration fuck.\n\nJAMES\nWhy the fuck would you bring him here? Hmm? It's opening night. I got a full house upstairs.\n\nTOMMY\nI thought you'd want to teach this motherfucker a lesson.\n\nJAMES\nAnd the girl?\n\nTOMMY\nHe needed some persuasion to talk.\n\nJAMES\nWhat? We got to let her go. Tommy, think. This girl has brothers, cousins, someone who gives a fuck about her. You fuck with her, they come running, looking for her.\nThey come with machetes or they come with guns. Hermanos Tainos, Soldado Nation. People we deal with, or worse, people we don't.\n\nTOMMY\nSay good-bye to Maria, Miguel.\n\nMARIA\n[Sobbing] Oh, Miguel. [Babbles in Spanish]\n\nMIGUEL\nHey, I'm sorry.\n\n[James begins to take the top half of his suit off]\n\nMARIA\nMiguel, por favor. Miguel, baby! Miguel! Miguel!\n\nJAMES\nGo home, take a shower. I'll send my man here with you, okay? You give him these clothes. You go to work tomorrow like nothing happened. If somebody ask you, you and Miguelito broke up, understand? Escuchame. You were never here. Entiende? Entiende?\nMARIA\nSi. Si!\nJAMES\nYou stay with her till she's out of the shower, and then burn her clothes.\n\nMARIA\n[Whimpers] Miguel! [Screams]\n\nMIGUEL\nMaria! I'm sorry!\n\nMARIA\nMiguel!\n\nJAMES\nWell, well, here we are, miguelito. Que orienda. You and me: two men who would rather be anywhere but here. Conyo. I know I had other plans. How 'bout you? I know you had a plan, Miguel. You didn't hit my money man by chance. Someone told you where to go, who to hit.\n\nMIGUEL\nMan, I ain't gonna tell you shit.\n\nJAMES\n[Wrapping up his fist] Mira, mira, mira. We let Maria go.\n- [Whimpers] - Tell me who set this up and I'll let you go too.\n\nMIGUEL\nI can't. I can't. I can't. Please, man. Please, okay? I swear to God. I swear to God. Oh, God.\n\nJAMES\nNo hables, we both know how this ends. Neither one of us walks out of here a happy man, huh?\n\nMIGUEL\nI don't wanna rat. I don't. [James punches him.]LAKEISHA\nWhat?\n\nTASHA\nYes.\n\nJOSH\nMrs. St. Patrick. You seen the boss? I want to show him the numbers so far tonight. We're killing it.\n\nTASHA\nNo, but you can show them to me.\n\nJOSH\nI don't know if I'm supposed to do that.\n\nTASHA\nYou can show them to me.\n\nJOSH\nWe're having an amazing night. Off the charts.\n\nTASHA\n[Clicks tongue] If you say so.\n\nLAKEISHA\nHe's cute.\n\nJAMES\n[Lifts Miguel up.] Your problem is, Miguel, you suffer from a serious case of misplaced loyalty. The men you're protecting sent you out to steal from the wrong motherfuckers tonight. Either they overestimated you or they underestimated us. But they left you hanging out to dry, partna.  [Throws Miguel to the ground] Tell me who hired you? And then you can come work for us. Tonight, you sleep in tu cama. You still have a choice, Miguelito. Escoge.\nMIGUEL\nSi hablo, matan me familia. I\u2019m not afraid to die.\n\nJAMES\nAnd I'm not afraid to kill you. [Gunshot]\n\nMIGUEL\nUhh!\n\nJAMES\nClean that up. I want the shit spotless, like it never fucking happened! [Walks up towards tommy and begins getting dressed] This shit makes no sense. We had nineteen drivers delivering product tonight, right?\n\nTOMMY\nTwenty. [?]\u2019s caught a bachelor party, had to stay on to deliver.\n\nJAMES\nAnd this motherfucker here hits Cruz, when he's holding the money from all the day runs? Plus we did that brick drop tonight.\n\nTOMMY\nThe wholesale shit.\n\nJAMES\nRight. So Cruz is carrying today's cash from our whole fucking organization, Tommy. The whole fucking organization. If he gets here twenty minutes later, after he's made the drop at the house, they get nothing. What does that tell you?\n\nTOMMY\nAsshole was working with one of our people.\n\nJAMES\nWhat if it's someone who knows our fucking business? Tainos, Rock Street Killahz, Soldado Nation.\n\nTOMMY\nWhy would they bite the hand that feeds them? They fuck with us, they lose their distro.\n\nJAMES\nBecause everybody hates middle management, man. Maybe they wanted to go straight to the source.\n\nTOMMY\nShit, none of these guys got the stones to fuck with Lobos directly. Still, the Soldados or Hermanos Tainos wanted to take us down, they'd hit all our people, all at once.\n\nJAMES\nWhich means we have to take everybody off the street, now. Close the store? We can't afford to get hit again. If one of our people is behind this, we don't know who they're working with. We don't know who to hit back. We can't stand around with our dicks in our hands waiting on the other guy to make his next move.\n\n[Tommy begins to call somone]\n\nMAN\nYo. What's up?\n\nTOMMY\nWe're canceling Christmas. Shut it all down, now.[\u201cJump Up In The Air And Stay There\u201d by Erykah Badu plays, there\u2019s a bachelor party.]\n\nBEST MAN\nJust buy enough to keep the girls happy. We got a long night ahead of us.\n\n[Cuts to James on an elevator headed up while he\u2019s getting dressed. Cuts to different dealers around the city getting a text #1 86 at 10:51 PM]\n\nBEST MAN\nWhat?\n\nDEALER\nI gotta go.\n\nBEST MAN\nWait, where you going? Wait. Where you going? Dude? I'm the best man. What the fuck am I supposed to do now?\n\n[Cuts to James walking down a back hallway backing into Truth\u2019s main floor]\n\nJAMES\nTable 45 was drinking Wataribune Sake. Take that back to the bar, and when you're done, flip the bottles at 72, 68, and 64. They all need to order another round.\n\nHOLLY\nI think they're slowing down.\n\nJAMES\nThen get them up and out, holly we got people outside who want to give us their money. Go.\n\nTASHA\nOh, my God, I had so much fun.\n\nLAKEISHA\nI know, me too, girl.\n\nTASHA\nThanks for coming.\n\nLAKEISHA\nAll right, babe. Call me later.\n\nTASHA\nAll right.\n\nLAKEISHA\nOkay.\n\nJAMES\nGet home safely, Lakeisha.\n\nLAKEISHA\nHi. Thank you.\n\nTASHA\nEverything okay?\n\nJAMES\nYeah. You good? Entertaining our guests?\n\nTASHA\nIt's late, baby. Why don't we go home? You know, we could do a little celebrating of our own.\n\nJAMES\nYou take the car. Send Shawn back for me.\n\nJAMES\nAlex.\nALEX\nYeah.\nJAMES\nCould you please escort my wife to the door? Night, T. [To Alex] I'm sticking around.\n\n[Tasha walks to the car.]\n\nSHAWN\nGoing home now, Mrs. St. Patrick?\n\nTASHA\nWhere else would I go? [\u201cWings \u2013 Black Boots Remix\u201d by Tony Swoon & Taylr Renee plays.]JAMES\nSee that, pop? I did it. Your boy did it.\n\nTOMMY\nI've been looking all over for you. Everyone got clear. No problems. Nobody tried shit.\n\nJAMES\nAll the hustling, all the work. From working the corner for Breeze and Kanan. It brought us here. You know, for two knuckleheads that grew up like us, Tommy, to make it in the city, man, ain't no small shit.\n\nTOMMY\nWe lost 200k tonight, before we closed the store. Plus whatever we lost since. Can we make up for that by selling drinks?\n\nJAMES\nThe money ain't the real problem.\n\nTOMMY\nFuck that, it's not the real problem.\n\nJAMES\nNo, the real problem we need to find out who the fuck is behind this. Miguel died tonight to protect them. We need answers. Quick. Especially after we tell Lobos we got hit.\n\nTOMMY\nShit, I say we don't tell him. He ain't gotta know about this. We pay him. Get the fuck out of there.\n\nJAMES\nNah. We gotta get out in front of it, man. Only six months we're working for him. We got no history built. Lobos finds out about this, and we ain't say shit?\n\nTOMMY\nIt's our ass anyway. We got his product sitting in a goddamn shipping container losing money by the minute. [Phone vibrates]\n\nJAMES\nYour mom?\n\nTOMMY\nYeah. She probably can't fucking sleep again. I'm just saying, Lobos sets fire to people.\n\nJAMES\nThat guy was fucking his sister, man. We gotta give him his money cash.\n\nTOMMY\nYeah. I got half. But it's out at my mother's. I'll bring it tomorrow. Hey, I heard back from drift. That guy over in E. O. He wants to get up with us next week. Talked about buying from us.\n\nJAMES\nNah, we gotta hold off on Jersey. Not till we find out what the fuck's going on. Can't expand under fire.\n\n\nTOMMY\nHey, yo. You got some fine-ass-looking girls serving drinks in there, by the way. There was this one red hair, tall. What's her name?\n\nJAMES\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Her name is \u201cDon't touch the merchandise, motherfucker.\u201d Don't touch the merchandise, okay? [Laughs] You ever gonna get over that red hair shit?\n\nTOMMY\nProbably not.[James undresses in his three-sided mirror. He stutters at the sight of blood, revealed on his sleeveless shirt, while taking on his button-down. With both shirts off, he stands in the mirror, with the rolled up sleeveless in his right hand, as he looks down at himself. Turns around, heads to his safe, and sticks the shirt in there with his money. ]\n[The cellphone alarm goes off and James wakes up to shut if off.]\nTASHA\nWhen did you get home?\n\nJAMES\nLate. [Exhales]\nTASHA\n[As she kisses his body] You know, I could help you relax if you let me.\n\nJAMES\nOh, come on, Tash.\n\nTASHA\nLet me.\n\n[They both strip naked and have sex. James begins to have flashbacks of the previous night, of murdering Miguel, during the - what was supposed to be an intimate moment.]\n\nTASHA\nCome here.\nJAMES\nI gotta go.\n\nTASHA\nWhat? Where you going? Ah.ESTELLE\nOkay, here.\n\nRAINA\nThe sun'll come out - tomorrow\nTASHA\nGood girl.\nRAINA\nBet your bottom dollar that tomorrow there'll be sun\nESTELLE\nRaina, what are you doing?\n\nTASHA\nShe's rehearsing, mom.\n\nRAINA\nThe auditions for the lower school play in a month, and I want to be prepared.\n\nESTELLE\nI'm talking about your outfit. It's not flattering in your shape, baby. How about that nice dress I bought you?\n\nRAINA\nNobody wears dresses to school, big mama.\nJAMES\nDaddy's little girly boo-boo.\n[Kisses] Morning, Estelle.\n\nESTELLE\nGood morning.\n\nRAINA\nWe're gonna have a tea party and play with the castle.\n[Cell phone rings] Come on.\n\nESTELL\nSit up here with grandma.\n\nJAMES\nLobos. No, veremos despu\u00e9s. Claro.\n\nTARIQ\nSo I got Spanish homework due Tuesday. Think dad could hook it up?\nTASHA\nNo. You have to do your own work, boy.\n\nTARIQ\nHow does he know Spanish anyway?\n\nESTELLE\nYeah, Tasha. How does he know Spanish? I don't know.\n\nTASHA\nHe learned before we met.\n\nSHAWN\nMorning, Mrs. St. Patrick.\n\nTASHA\nHey, Shawn. What's up, Reina? Ah, Tariq, what's up, boy?\n\nTARIQ\nWhen we gonna hoop, Shawn? I've been begging you forever.\n\nTASHA\nBoy, leave him alone. Tariq, he's busy. Got a big job now. You want some breakfast? There's more than enough to go around. Go ahead.\n\nSHAWN\nOh.

She can't be out there all the time. [Cell phone vibrates]\n\nTOMMY\nLobos?  Better not be changing the fucking time again. By the way, I'm rethinking this whole \"tell Lobos we got hit\" idea of yours.\n\nJAMES\nIt's Kantos. Let's see what he wants. - [Beep] - What's up?\n\nKANTOS\nYou recognize the name Simon stern? Yeah.\n\nJAMES\nThe cat that owns Parlay, Verbatim, Syrup.\n\nKANTOS\nYeah, plus, like, five other clubs. He's one of the biggest nightlife investors in New York. His office called. Stern told the page six to write up about truth. Wants to sit down.\n\nJAMES\nI got a lot of shit on my plate at the moment. We'll talk later.\n\nKANTOS\nIt's a big deal. He only talks to the major guys. Look, with stern behind us, we can open up clubs in Miami and Vegas end of next year.\n\nJAMES\nI'll call you back, man.\n\nTOMMY\nWhat's his problem now? You know what, never mind. We got real shit to do.\n\nLOBOS\nGhost, Tommy. Good to see you again. You have my money, of course?\n\nLOBO\u2019S MAN\nUno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis\n\nLOBOS\n[Lobos kicks him] No en voz!  \u00bfQu\u00e9 eres, un ni\u00f1o de escuela primaria?  Pedro. Pedro, por favor, con eso.\nJAMES\nIt\u2019s all there, Todo.\n\nLOBOS\nTodo. [Waits.] Pedro? [Pedro nods in agreement]? Si. Now that the business is out of the way, we can eat and enjoy ourselves, eh? How are things? Just fine.\n\nJAMES\nSomething you need to know. Hmm? We got hit last night.\n\nLOBOS\nSo I heard. Did you catch this man?\n\nTOMMY\nWe got him.\n\nJAMES\nHe knew who to hit, where and when. So until we know how he got his information, we're exposed.\n\nLOBOS\nOh, so he didn't talk?\n\nTOMMY\nUnfortunately for him.\n\nLOBOS\nUnfortunately for you. You took your men off the street.\n\nTOMMY\nHad to.\n\nJAMES\nNo choice.\n\nLOBOS\nYou're losing about $25,000 an hour. It's good to see that you knew enough not to let it affect our pay schedule. When I hired you six months ago to be my New York distributor, you guaranteed me a certain level of professionalism. You told me that the Kings, the Bloods, the DDP, that none of them were worth my time. I believe the exact words were, \"They're gangs. And we're a business.\" Hmm? You also told me that only you could guarantee me a safe and secure pipeline - with no interruptions.\n\nTOMMY\nCome on, Lobos. You know in this business, there's no guarantees.\n\nJAMES\nWe have a plan to fix this situation.\n\nLOBOS\nThen you don't have time for lunch. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Anta [Halts Ghost from leaving]. Tommy leaves the room and they converse in Spanish].\nTranslation:\n\nLOBOS\nYou know, I checked out. Your name is feared on the streets.. If you get the situation under control you could have your own Cartel one day. Understand.\nJAMES\nYes.\nLOBOS\nYou live in the country side, take up watercolors while your men take all the risk. You do business two, three days a year. You don't, I'll have to take my business elsewhere. And then, what use will I have for you?\nJAMES\nWe\u2019ll get it done.\nLOBOS\nYes, you will.\n\nJAME\nGoodbye, boss\n\nLOBOS\nGoodbye Ghost. [Ghost leaves] Call the pilot, we\u2019re not leaving tonight.\n\nJAMES\nI'll go see Ruiz. You get Anibal and Rolla, deal?\n\nTOMMY\nYeah.\n\nJAMES\nSee you tonight. And watch your back.\n\nTOMMY\nYou too, motherfucker. Full detail, right? Even the trunk?\n\n?\nEspecially the trunk.\n\nTOMMY\nGood. I hate the smell of blood.[Tommy goes to see Anibal at a cookout.]\n\nANIBAL\nThomas! [Sends everyone away] Where\u2019s ghost?\n\nTOMMY\nHe sends his regards\n\nANIBAL\nYou play Dominoes?\n\nTOMMY\nThis is not a social visit, Anibal. We got hit last night.\n\nANIBAL\nMy bad, I ain't hear that.\n\nTOMMY\nNot a word?\n\nANIBAL\nNada.\n\nTOMMY\nYeah, well, a score like that somebody will brag about. You\u2019ll hear something. Fifty stakes. Seventy-five if you bring him back alive.\n\nANIBAL\nMeans that much to you? If it's one of your men, you can kill him yourself. We just want to watch.[James meets Ruiz in the park.]\n\nRUIZ\nIf I knew who ordered it, yeah, they'd be dead already.\n\nJAMES\nWhat? What?\n\nRUIZ\nWe got hit too. My money guy, same as yours. They shot my boy, Angel. They shot himin the back of the head. Had a baby on the way.\n\nJAMES\nThat's fucked up.\n\nRUIZ\nOkay, look. I know, okay, you work with other crews.  But we got to dead this.You have to stop this before it goes any further. I could lend you men, extra protection.\n\nJAMES\nNah, if they know we ride together, I lose trust of the Tainos and Rock Street.\n\nRUIZ\nCan\u2019t trust them anyway\n\nJAMES\nTommy and I are neutral. Tu sabes eso, papa. Come on.\n\nRUIZ\nBueno. Maybe there's something else that we could work out.[Agent Juan Julio Medina watches Lobos in his car from a distance.][GHOST\u2019S KITCHEN]\n\nRAINA\nIt's the lead, uncle Tommy. If I get it, it'll be like a huge deal. 'Cause I'm only in the fifth grade.\n\nTOMMY\nI'm sure you got the best singing voice in the whole place, baby girl.\n\nRAINA\nWhen are you gonna stop calling me that? I'm not the baby anymore. Jasmine is.\nI was there when you were born.\n\nTOMMY\nYou'll always be baby girl to me.\n\nESTELLE\nTo all of us, baby girl.\n\nTASHA\nTommy, have some more chicken.\n\nTOMMY\nMmm, oh. Mmm. Thanks, T.\n\nTASHA\nYou know, if you meet a girl who can cook, I bet we'd never see you again.\n[\nTOMMY\nLaughs] No way that'll ever happen. I gotta come over here and school Tariq in Call of Duty.\n\nTARIQ\nYeah, right, uncle Tommy.\n\nJAMES\nYeah, right. \u2018Cause you know you're not supposed to be playing those games anyway.\n\nTOMMY\nOh, my bad.\n\nRAINA\nStars for my little star. Keep working hard on that audition.\n\nJAMES\nHey.\n\nRAINA\nWait, daddy. Are these real diamonds?\n\nJAMES\n[Laughs] What you think, huh?\n\nTASHA\nIf you keep this up, you're gonna spoil her rotten.\n\nJAMES\nAnd you don't complain when I do it to you. [Slaps her butt] Fix me a plate, okay? Tommy and I gonna talk in the office. We got work to do.\n\nESTELLE\nLet me see them diamonds, baby girl.\n\nJAMES\nSoldado Nation got hit too.\n\nTOMMY\nNo shit.\n\nJAMES\nRuiz got a full shipment of weapons from his Florida connect last week. Our drivers can have full use till the shit blows over or until we catch the motherfucker. He offered to have his people ride with ours.\n\nTOMMY\nFuck that.\n\nJAMES\nFuck that. The guns, though, that could work. I know you don't like it. Police stop a driver carrying recreational weight and some cash, Tommy, that's one thing. But a gun in the car, you're looking at intent to distribute, plus the weapons charge. Kanan got what 15 years?\n\nTOMMY\nYou got a better idea? 'Cause we gotta open up the store or Lobos will move on. Not to mention our people are off the clock, and our customers will find new places to cop.\n\nJAMES\nLet's say we find the motherfucker. And it is one of Anibal's people or Rock Street Killahz or whoever.Then what?\n\nTOMMY\nThen it's on. Then we take down the whole fucking crew. We show them. We show everybody. You can't fuck with us, like the old days before Kanan went inside.\n\nJAMES\nWe were young then. Mobile. I got too much shit going on now to go into hiding.\nThe kids. The club.\n\n\nTOMMY\nOh, wait, so now the club dictates what we do with the real business instead of the other way around? And we opened up the laundromats to clean the money. I was fine with that. But then you said, \"let's open up a nightclub. So we can hide even more.\u201d So I agreed to hide the money. Period.\n\nJAMES\nWhat if there could be more than that though, man? What if it's our retirement plan?\n\nTOMMY\nYou mean we grow up, go legit, live happily ever after? [Laughs] I'm sor - [Laughing]. We've been hustling together our whole lives. I love this shit and so do you. Focus up. I say we take Ruiz up on his offer. We put the boys back on the street, and if anyone steps, they light that motherfucker up. Agreed?\n\nJAMES\nYeah.\n\nTOMMY\nWe'll go out and get the guns from Ruiz tonight. I'll set it up. Go without me. Take Julio. I gotta handle a few things at the club. You want a place to clean our money long-term, it's gotta stay open, right?\n\nTOMMY\nNow that's the motherfucking hustler I know talking.[Tasha and Ghost\u2019s bathroom.]\n\nJAMES\nI'll see you at the club later. I'm going now. Gotta make sure everything's settled for tonight.\n\nTASHA\nCan't that new white boy do that? You pay him enough.\n\nJAMES\nIt's a business, baby. It needs attention 24/7.\n\n\nTASHA\nSo do I. Ghost, what's up? You and Tommy behind closed doors, you running around with this club.\nWe okay?\n\nJAMES\nWhen we met, what'd you think I was gonna be? Hmm?\n\nTASHA\nThe biggest goddamn drug dealer in New York City.\nJAMES\nYou never thought about more?\n\n\nTASHA\nWhat more? You talking about the club as more? I saw the money you made last night. That's not more, it's less. You are the best at what you do. We have everything. I just want it to stay this way. What?\n\nJAMES\nWhen you come to the club tonight, you need to look like you own the place, not like you trying to get in for free. Wear that purple dress I got you last month. But, baby, I like this dress. I'll send Shawn back, give you time to change.[\u201cOhh Shh\u201d plays by Chris Lake and then switches to \u201cOwn It\u201d by Mack Wilds]\n\nTASHA\nHave you seen my husband?\n\nGUARD\nAnybody got eyes on the boss?

Mwah.\n\nJAMES\nWhat's up?\n\nKANTOS\nThe DJ brought backup dancers who are not in the contract.\n\nJAMES\nWell, we got extra spotlights on hand? We could find them. Have the guys put them up.\n\nJAMES\n[Spots Angie from a balcony and heads downstairs.] Angie!\n\nANGELA\nJamie\n\nJAMES\nAngela Valdes. How long has it been?\n\nANGELA\nI don't know. Almost, Jesus, 18 years.\nJAMES\nYou look the same.\n\nANGELA\n[Laughs] Well, that's proof we've gotten older. Your eyesight's going.\n\nJAMES\n[Laughs] My eyes work just fine. What have you been doing?\n\nANGELA\nFor 18 years? Not sure there's a short answer.\nChoate, college, law school\u2026\n\nJAMES\nlaw school? Okay, big-time.\n\nANGELA\nStop it. I'm still the same \"round the way\" girl I always was.\n\nJAMES\nSame girl, huh? Not exactly. I don't remember that dress.\n\nANGELA\nWell, I don't remember that suit either, uptown. What have you been up to, Jamie? What have you been doing all these years?\n\nGUARD\nBoss, the new DJ's gonna start.\n\nANGELA\nWait, did he just call you \"boss\"?\n\nJAMES\nI own this place.\n\nGUARD\nKantos said he needs to talk to you now.\n\nJAMES\nAll right. Um - Sorry, I gotta - You got a nightclub to run.\n\nANGELA\nI get it. You deserve this crown we got it sewn up because we own it it was good to see you.\n\nANGELA\nYou too.\n\n[They give each other a big hug]\n\nJAMES\nOkay. [Walks away and then comes back] You know what, give me your number. I ain\u2019t gonna let you get away that easy. I\u2019ll call you.\n\nANGELA\nOkay\n\nKANTOS\nMrs. St. Patrick, you're not leaving, are you?

Let's go, we're late.JAMES\nJulio tell them to check the guns?\nTOMMY\nFirst thing I said to him. Think it bothers them they don't know who they're working for?\nJAMES\nYou think the fry cook at burger king knows the fucking CEO? They wouldn't know that motherfucker if he walked in and asked for extra ketchup. Don't forget.\n\nTOMMY\nOne of these people might be the reason Cruz got jumped in the first place. Yeah, well, let's hope he or she is afraid to get shot.\n\nJAMES\nWe'll know soon enough.\n\nTOMMY\nOur soldiers are strapped now. We should be too. All this shit going on, how am I gonna explain to Tasha I let you run around with no piece?\n\nJAMES\nLet's get 'em out on the street. Time to make the doughnuts.ANGELA\nNot bad for 18 years later. Greg.\n\nGREG\nHey, sleepyhead. You missed our run this morning. When you didn't show up and you didn't answer your cell, I thought maybe something was wrong.\nANGELA\nShit. Sorry.\n\nGREG\nGot here and you were in the shower, so I thought I'd grab breakfast.\n\nANGELA\nGreg, I thought we said the key was just for emergencies. Which this could've been. This just feels a little - you don't need to check on me.\n\nGREG\nCome on, Angela, I think most women would be happy to know that someone's looking out for them.\n\nANGELA\nYou're right. I'm sorry. You just startled me is all. Thank you.\n\nGREG\n[Phone vibrates] I gotta go. See you later.JAMES\nAngela Valdes came into the club last night.\n\nTOMMY\nFrom high school? Wow. What's that?\n\nJAMES\nEighteen years.\n\nTOMMY\nHow'd she look?\n\nJAMES\nMm.\n\nTOMMY\nThat good, huh? She married now, she got kids?\n\nJAMES\nNo ring, didn't say nothing about kids.\n\nTOMMY\nYou tell her about yours?\n\nJAMES\nWell, we didn't talk that long.\n\nTOMMY\nOh, shit.\n\nJAMES\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\n\nTOMMY\nWhat that means is what are you thinking about doing? When that girl moved away, she seriously fucked you up. I was there, remember?\n\nJAMES\nAw, come on. That was a long time ago.\n\nTOMMY\nWell, Tasha's a good woman, man. You ain't never fucked around on her before. Why do you want to go sniffing around pussy from high school?\n\nJAMES\nTommy, first of all, I can't believe you starting some shit about monogamy. You got more bitches than a goddamn pound, but second, I know me and Tasha got a good thing. I'm not trying to fuck that up. It's just got me thinking, you know, about the road not traveled, that's all.\n\nTOMMY\n\"The road not traveled\"? You are a rich, successful motherfucker. What more do you want?\n\nJAMES\nI want to see how Angela turned out.\n\nTOMMY\nNo, you already saw how she turned out. Anything else is just you trying to heal wounds from childhood.\n\nJAMES\nYou gotta stop watching that Dr. Phil shit.\n\nTOMMY\nThat man knows what he's talking about.\n\nJAMES\nShut up.\n\n\nTOMMY\nSit down. You shut up.\n\nJAMES\nNo, shut up. So long, motherfucker.\n\nTOMMY\nYou didn't ask about that thing we did the other night.\n\nJAMES\nYou clean it up like I said? Then there ain't nothing to ask about. What, you think I forgot?\n\nTOMMY\nYeah, I do.\n\nJAMES\nGet the fuck out of here.\n\nLAKEISHA\nCan I borrow this?\n\nTASHA\nNo way, girl. That's new. But the Gucci, you can have that.\n\nLAKEISHA\nDamn, girl. Ghost keeps you laced. Yo, I don't care. I'll take your hand-me-downs as long as you're giving them out. So this is what happily ever after looks like. You hit the lottery, girl. Niggas ain't getting married like that, and certainly not rich niggas.\n\nTASHA\nHe wasn't rich when I met him. Hmm. You know, Keisha, clothes and bags are nice, but there are some things about ghost you can't see.\n\nLAKEISHA\nYou don't gotta play modest with me, Tasha.\n\nTASHA\nI'm not playing modest.\n\nLAKEISHA\nI'm not gonna die of jealousy over here, especially if you're through with these boots.

You know I don't get all this European shit.\n\nTASHA\n[Cell phone chimes, vibrates] Hey, baby.\n\nJAMES\nYou out shopping with Lakeisha yet?\n\nTASHA\nWe're still at the house.\n\nJAMES\nGood.

You\u2019re the first Mexican I\u2019ve known to do that. Forgive my surprise.\n\nLOBOS\nI do business with niggers. At least you and I speak the same language. I don\u2019t care who your mother fucked. I want to make money.\n\nRUIZ\nBueno. Should we make business then?\n\nLOBOS\nBueno.[Hip-hop music playing from headphones and a pick up is made.]ANGELA\nNew York's so different now. Citi bikes, no cars in Times Square. White people living uptown.\n\nJAMES\n[Laughter] You been gone a minute.\n\nANGELA\nMm. You finally got your nightclub. Your dad would've been proud.\n\nJAMES\nI told you about my father's nightclub? He lost the place before we met. I didn't remember I told you that.\n\nANGELA\nI think we told each other everything back then.\n\nJAMES\nHmm.\n\nANGELA\nThe last time we had lunch, I'm pretty sure there was no linen tablecloths.\n\nJAMES\nI don't think we had chairs.\n\nJAMES\nWe grabbed a slice at the counter at Ray's on Sutphin.\n\nANGELA\nYou kept refilling your coke. The manager was giving you that evil-ass look. You kept going.\n\nJAMES\nThe sign said, \"free refills. I was trying to get you to stay longer.\n\nANGELA\nI almost missed my train.\n\nJAMES\nThat was the idea. That was the idea.\n\nANGELA\nChoate was the opportunity of a lifetime. But that doesn't mean it was easy to go. Jamie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I left the way I did.\n\nANGELA\nYour parents made you go.\n\nJAMES\nBut I didn't fight them. You said you'd be back for Christmas.\n\nANGELA\nMy family moved to Sunnyside after I left.\n\nJAMES\nI had the same number. But you were just [Whoosh] Gone. And then when my pops died, I thought then, at least, you would reach out.\n\nANGELA\nI should've been there for you. But I just knew that if I called, if I heard your voice, I would go back.\nI would've dropped everything for you. Everything my parents worked for, everything I'd worked for So I made a choice.\n\nJAMES\nI wouldn't have asked you to come back. You didn't belong in the hood.\n\nANGELA\nNeither did you.\n\nJAMES\nAh.\n\nANGELA\nBut now we're both out, just like we always planned.\n\nJAMES\nNot exactly how we planned.\n\nANGELA\nOh, shit.\n\nJAMES\nWhat?\n\nANGELA\nI gotta go.\nJAMES\nNow?\n\nANGELA\nI gotta get back to the office.\n\nJAMES\nAll right.\n\nANGELA\nThanks for lunch.\n\nJAMES\nMm-hmm.\n\nANGELA\nMmm. Hey\u2026you still remember the Spanish I taught you\n\nJAMES\nUn poquito. Chinchi\n\nANGELA\nBye.\n\nJAMES\nWhen can we do this again?\n\nANGELA\nI'll call you.TOMMY\nDon't fill out the total.\n\nKANTOS\nWhy not?\n\nTOMMY\nI'm gonna confirm your count at the bank. I'll take that.\n\nKANTOS\nEvery club I've ever managed, I always do the deposit.\n\nTOMMY\nThere's a first time for everything. Deposit slip?\n\nKANTOS\nI already signed it. Want a fresh one?\n\nTOMMY\nNah, I'm sure yours will turn out fine. Look, we hired you for your contacts, not your reputation.\n\nKANTOS\nHey, about that boss never told me how you found out about that.\n\nTOMMY\nNone of your fucking business how we know. As long as you work for us, this is how it goes. We don't have a problem, do we?\n\nKANTOS\nNo, we don't.FRANKIE\n[Laughs] Was just about to send out a search party for you. You're never late.\n\nANGELA\nI know. Sorry. Lunch ran long. Frankie, I know you went out on a limb for me. I'm not gonna blow it.\n\nFRANKIE\nIf you do, it's both our asses.\n\nSAXE\nCongrats on the promotion, Valdes.\n\nANGELA\nThanks, Saxe. You're on this now?\n\nGREAG\nJust got assigned. If I request reassignment, they're gonna ask why.\n\nFRANKIE\nI'm Francesca Lavarro, chief of criminal division along with my deputy, A.U.S.A. Angela Valdes. I'll be leading this task force. Our goal is the prosecution of one of the most notorious drug traffickers in our hemisphere, Mexican national Felipe Lobos. Lobos's brutality and vicious nature are well documented. For everyone's safety, please remember the task force is top secret. And no one, not even your families, can know the name of the target of this investigation. Agent medina, can you please bring everybody up to speed on Lobos's movements in New York this week?\n\nMEDINA\nLobos landed at Teterboro airport on Tuesday. Once a year, he comes to New York to meet with his banker and his American attorneys. Now, he did make those meetings, but I followed him to a third, to meet this man Carlos \"Vibora\" Ruiz. Leader of the due loco set of the Soldado Nation Gang.\nWe learned that, one, Lobos has one single distributor for his product in New York City. Two, he's not entirely happy with his distributor. And three, soldado nation and Ruiz are too low-rent for Lobos.\nThey're not organized enough to distribute his product. And he was not shy in telling Mr. Ruiz he did not give a fuck!\n\nANGELA\n[Laughter] We have permission from the Mexican government to detain and prosecute Mr. Lobos if we can build a compelling case against him.\n\nFRANKIE\nWe can't touch him unless we know we can put him in jail.\n\nANGELA\nWho can give us the names, places, and dates we need to convict Lobos? His New York distributor. Unfortunately we have no idea who that is. We do have a profile of the type of criminal we're looking for. He's a highly organized individual with an established network in place. He already knows how to move money through the system, is violent enough to control his territory, but still has something to lose something Lobos can threaten to keep him in line. So why is Lobos looking to replace him? What could've gone wrong? There must be some element out of his control. [Pink Sneakers attempts to kill one of the carriers] Whatever the reason, this problem between Lobos and his local guy is exactly what we need to exploit, because the man we're looking for is in grave danger from Lobos and from us.\nWe can give him a way out, but only if he decides to take it.\n\nJAMES\n[Cell phone vibrates] Tommy, what's up?

I came to know these two wonderful people, first through the mutual acquaintanceship of Kaye Ballard's agent Mark Sendroff who first suggested I speak with them, and then of course through Kaye and others' insistence on me interviewing them about their memories of Penzance, which I summarily pursued.\n\n\u200bThe two were staying in Hawaii a few weeks ago when I called. Shortly after the interview, they trekked to sunny Florida in time for Robby's appearance at Disney Candlelight in Epcot. Robby and Karla have been busy promoting the highly anticipated 2017 live-action Beauty and the Beast reboot, but they were so gracious to offer their help to promote my album as well. Without further ado, here is the text of our delightful interview.ADRIAN D. HOLMES: How did you become involved with music in the first place?ROBBY BENSON: Karla, you go first.\n\nKARLA DEVITO: No, you go. Your career started before mine.\n\nROBBY: Okay. Music has always been a part of my life, before I even had any memory of my life. My parents were musicians. My father was a composer and lyricist. My mom was a singer and performer. By the time I was eight, I was on stage in The King and I, and I guess by ten I played Oliver! for the first time. I did Peter Pan in college. I was even in the Broadway musical The Rothschilds. Open Heart is my musical on Off-Broadway at Cherry Lane. I\u2019m also working on my second Broadway show right now. I came to New York to perform in a program, but once that closed, there really were not many other opportunities for people in my age group, so that\u2019s when I auditioned for some of the up-and-coming bands of the day.\n\nMy desire was always to be in the orchestra pit, however, so I started writing music with my father when I was very young, like when I was twelve or fourteen. I would write the music and he would write the lyrics. I would play on The Mike Douglas Show, The Merv Griffin Show, and The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. They\u2019d always ask me to sing an original piece whenever I was promoting something. I would also play session guitar locally in New York.\n\nI played for Joe Brooks. He was kind of wild, but he would hire me to play for a lot of his sessions. After we\u2019d play, I would sing with all the singers. Every time we doubled ourselves or sang harmonies, we would get paid double or triple. Even for a young man, to go downstairs to the mailbox and see it stuffed with nothing but checks for commercials and jingles was so exciting for me because I knew I was participating in something in the real world. But what ended up happening, people wanted me to sing songs that I thought were silly bubblegum pieces, so I went on my merry way because I was composer and a writer and I wanted to do my stuff. The stuff that was pop, I didn\u2019t want to sing. My background was very much the New York Philharmonic and very much Broadway oriented. My foundation really is Gilbert & Sullivan and Rodgers & Hammerstein.\nMusic is a great way to meditate, and everything is good. I\u2019d have to say to our president-elect, don\u2019t take away those programs. They are important. I was very lucky in my youth, because I worked with some of the most professional musicians and singers in the jingles. But I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve never sung with anyone who was as amazing and versatile as Karla. It\u2019s almost like the musical gods touched me on the head and said, \u201cDo what you can!\u201d And then they touched Karla, and said, \u201cYou have all the talent!\u201d\n\nKARLA: Thanks, Robby!\n\nROBBY: If it were up to me, Karla would sing on any and every project I have anything to do with. Now, Karla, I think it\u2019s your turn.\n\nKARLA: Well, you know, I was not a musician. I grew up in a home where music was everything. My mother had that HiFi stereo. Barbra Streisand\u2019s first album was a mainstay, and so were The Beatles. The thing that was so important to me is that I had an amazing music teacher in 5th, 6th, and 7th grade. She was the first person to expose me to Gilbert & Sullivan. In the eighth grade, we did The Mikado. That teacher was Sharon Conley. What she demanded from these little students in the Midwest was incredible. My math teachers and music teachers scared me the most. There was a phenomenal man named Tom Olson. When I sang \u201cPoor Wandering One\u201d on The Today Show, I gave him a shout-out and my mom told him to watch it. If I had not had that training in grade school, I never would have known what opportunities lay out there. My mother always sang at the house. The first ing\u00e9nue role I had was in The Pirates. I actually loved singing the harmonies.ADRIAN D. HOLMES: Considering your backgrounds in the genre of pop music, how did you end up in a production of The Pirates?KARLA: Robby was supposed to do Fred in the park, but he turned it down because he was busy filming a movie called The Chosen. Jim Steinman wrote Bat Out of Hell, Meatloaf\u2019s album, and I originated the live theatrical role of the female in the world tour. The wife of one of Jim\u2019s good friends was the second pianist for Pirates of Penzance, so she played for my audition. Originally, I was considered for the role of one of the sisters for the version in the park, but I did not want to be one because by that time I had my own record in the can. I was then offered another role in which I was guaranteed to make my Broadway debut. I went into Epic Records, asked the general manager to delay the release of my album, and he allowed for it.\n\nI got to go on for Linda when she was sick. I went on the week of press revues without a single dress rehearsal or even a costume, because Linda had it in her contract that she owned all her costumes. They had to run down to a bridal store and find this white dress to stick me in. I had a vocal rehearsal with the assistant, but no physical rehearsal with the other cast.\n\nROBBY: I was fortunate to get another phone call from Mr. Papp asking me to come and be in the show. I was an elitist. I had originated two parts in two different Broadway productions. I was kind of a snob. I didn\u2019t replace anyone, I originated. All my friends in New York were all gone, so I had nothing to do when Joe Papp invited me to see the show. It was one of the best shows I had ever seen. Except for one thing. I became furious with the way the person playing Fred was competing with Kevin Klein instead of helping him set up his comedy. I suddenly went, I got to do this because I knew the Frederic performance being played was not the way I felt it should be done.ADRIAN D. HOLMES: What were your impressions of your fellow cast members?KARLA: We always describe The Pirates of Penzance as a perfect wedding cake of a show. George Rose, Tony Azito, and all the women were phenomenal. I loved Tony Azito. He became one of my dear friends.\n\nROBBY: Kaye came in when I came in. She was so incredible. In fact, he was in a movie that I directed, and to this day we consider her family. Mark Sendroff, her agent-of-sorts, is one of my best friends on the face of the earth.\n\nKARLA: It was like magic. And back to funny, Robby and I came up with all these comedic bits. Wilford was wild about what we did, and we love Wilford because he was so darling. Wilford\u2019s genius was casting. I think Wilford\u2019s beautiful talent was finding incredible people and letting them run with their talent. Graciella Danielle understood my sense of humor. She allowed me to so many things when Wilford wasn\u2019t there, and then Wilford loved what she helped us do.ADRIAN D. HOLMES: According to various sources, you two met and fell in love in real life through the on-stage chemistry shared by Frederic and Mabel. Is this even a little bit true?KARLA: Yes, it\u2019s true. We credit Joseph Papp for bringing us together. Dan Burlinghoff, our director, he was our best man. Two weeks after Robby met me, he told Dan that he was going to marry me.\n\nRobby was not in the show yet when I started. They said that he was coming after Joe Papp had given me the role and everything. I couldn\u2019t wait, because there was no real rehearsal even I after I took the role. When they said this person named Robby Benson was going to do it, I had no idea who he was, but I just heard everyone talk about his sterling reputation, so I was thrilled that somebody like him was coming.\n\nRobby and I first met in the basement of the theater with Wilford Leach. I was on vocal rest at the time, and Robby had been sick too. That first night, Wilford told us both to mime through our parts.\n\nROBBY: I close my eyes right now, and when I do, I can see Karla and I can remember her when I saw her for the very first time. She is so selfless and so remarkably talented on stage. She is the best person I have ever met in my life. I remember when I went down to the basement and I saw Karla, I fell in love with her immediately. [pause] I don\u2019t know if you believe in the theory of sliding doors, but a door was open that night\u2014and there was Karla. She was the most talented person I had ever met, but she had absolutely no ego.\n\nYou see, mostly, in the film world, you fight for the opportunities to do what you like to do, but you\u2019re usually knocking heads with other actors trying to get something done. I clearly remember the first time I went on stage with Karla. The role of Fred is a thankless role. It\u2019s the workhorse. I had a lot of information to process. Also, I\u2019m a bass, not even a baritone, yet in The Pirates I had to perform a tenor role. I remember I took Karla\u2019s hand in mine, and all the sudden, she walked me to the mark where I was supposed to be because I had forgotten where I was supposed to be. That was the most selfless act I had experienced to that date, because that\u2019s just not something you experience in the world of Hollywood. I played Frederic the way I felt that he was supposed to be played: that Fred was mesmerized by Mabel\u2019s voice. That\u2019s when I created the bit of falling to my knees.ADRIAN D. HOLMES: What are your favorite songs from The Pirates?KARLA: \u201cLeave Me Not to Pine.\u201d When we performed together at Cherry Lane Theater, they asked us to sing whatever we wanted to sing, so we sang \u201cLeave Me Not\u201d and \u201cHere is Love.\u201dADRIAN D. HOLMES: What outstanding memories do you have from the show? \u200bAny bloopers or gaffes?ROBBY: One night, the Pirate King forgot his lines during the patter song, so I took my sword and pointed at the orchestra director and started singing, \u201cWhat Is This.\u201dADRIAN D. HOLMES: \u200bWhat is your impression of the music of Gilbert & Sullivan? Would you recommend it to the next generation of listeners?ROBBY: Absolutely we would encourage it. I was a college professor for twenty-eight years teaching film production, and I can tell you that I always looked for those gems. What I would do for younger people is I would have a Q&A after every show. If there were Wednesday and Sunday matinees where young people could come in groups to see Broadway where it is affordable, I would say let\u2019s have a Q&A for the young people who are so smart. I would like for them to see how way back when how these men made their audiences think and laugh. I think young people would absolutely adore a new version but not one that much different from what Wilford did. I wish you had the luxury of speaking to George Rose and Tony Azito. Those two men were absolutely remarkable in the show.ADRIAN D. HOLMES: Any final thoughts on The Pirates?ROBBY: The stage hands that helped move us to the Uris Theater, they took this one little spot with the red line where Mabel and Fred kissed every night, when they took down the show, they shipped that piece of the stage to us. We both feel very lucky because through the show we found our true soul mates. And the only thing I wish in the world of bootleg, lots of people got copies of the two of us singing.\n\nI believe Gilbert & Sullivan were two of the greatest minds in history. Their music and the libretto is so timely.\nKARLA: I grew up in this tiny little town called Mokena, Illinois. I saw Iolanthe, Yeoman of the Guard, and others. I think Gilbert & Sullivan works are really a great way for people to experience musical theater and do it. Also, I admire Linda Rondstadt because she broke barriers for other pop singers on Broadway. It was a terrific thing for her to do that. She was my inspiration growing up.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/393071", "artist_names": "Stevie Wonder", "full_title": "Keep On Running

Is not what you make it\nThat's what the upper class make it seems to you\nWell (Come on, come on now)\nPeople, open up your minds\n'Cause this is what you wanna do\n[Chorus]\nLiving your lives in a fool's paradise\nAnd that's not for me\nI tell you, yeah\nOf high society\nLiving your lives in a fool's paradise\nIt's part of growing up\n\n[Verse 2]\nA child shows much perception\nBut he's pointing the finger\nIn full spite of profit and go-getters\nWho strives for more, oh oh\nMore money, more power, more security\nHe stays so empty inside\nSo busy trying to get ahead\nThat he starts forgetting how to live, live, live\nThat he starts forgetting how to live, live, live\nThat he starts forgetting how to live, live, live\nExcept for\n\n[Chorus]\nLiving your lives in a fool's paradise\nAnd that's not for me\nI tell you, yeah\nOf high society\nLiving your lives in a fool's paradise\nIf there's some people choose\nWho's life they're willing to lose\nBut never\nWill they fight their own war\nYou might also like[Outro]\nThen he starts forgetting how to live, live, live\nThen he starts forgetting how to live, live, live\nThen he starts forgetting how to live, live,
