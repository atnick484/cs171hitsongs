Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro.

And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I.

And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him.

Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho!

Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape.

For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played.

Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.)

These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour.

But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\n\nA MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?\n\nA NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\n\nA FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!\n\nA BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father! Little father!\n\nTHE BABES AND SUCKLINGS\n\nClap clap hands till Poldy comes home,\nCakes in his pocket for Leo alone.\n\n\n(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)\n\n\nBABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.\n\n\nBLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends!

Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!\n\n\nTHE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!\n\n\n(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.\n\n\n(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)\n\n\nJIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic Majesty will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal advice, solution of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited. Given at this our loyal city of Dublin in the year I of the Paradisiacal Era.\n\n\nPADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?\n\n\nBLOOM Pay them, my friend.\n\n\nPADDY LEONARD Thank you.\n\n\nNOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?\n\n\nBLOOM (Obdurately.)

Lady Bloom accepts no presents.\n\nCROFTON This is indeed a festivity.\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.\n\nALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?\n\nBLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood.

The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)\n\nFATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.\n\nMRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!\n\nMOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!\n\nNOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom.

Down with Bloom!\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.\n\nBROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.\n\nBANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.\n\n(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)\n\nBRINI, PAPAL NUNCIO (In papal zouave's uniform, steel cuirasses as breastplate, armplates, thighplates, legplates, large profane moustaches and brown paper mitre.)

Bloom is a cod. A CRAB (In bush ranger's kit.) What did you do in the cattlecreep behind Kilbarrack?\n\nA FEMALE INFANT (Shakes a rattle.) And under Ballybough bridge?\n\nA HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?\n\nBLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.\n\nTHE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!\n\n(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)\n\nTHE ARTANE ORPHANS\n\nYou big, you bog, you dirty dog!\nYou think the ladies love you!\n\n\nTHE PRISON GATE GIRLS\n\nIf you see kay\nTell him he may\nSee you in tea\nTell him from me.\n\n\nHORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.\n\n(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)\n\nMESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.\n\nBLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!\n\n(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)\n\nREUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.\n\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!\n\nBROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.\n\n(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)\n\nTHE CITIZEN Thank heaven!\n\nBLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.\n\n(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)\n\nTHE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.\n\n(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling.

The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.)

Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ.

Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space.

Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill.

He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve.

Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss!

He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way.

Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth?

I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.)

Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.)

O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben!

When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills.

You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.)

The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo!

Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby.

Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!\n\nGARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!\n\n(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)\n\nTHE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!\n\n(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)\n\nSTEPHEN Hark! Our friend, noise in the street!\n\nZOE (Holds up her hand.) Stop!\n\nPRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON and CISSY CAFFREY\n\nYet I've a sort a\nYorkshire relish for...\n\n\nZOE That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?\n\nBLOOM Who'll.\n\nLYNCH (Handing her coins.) Here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Cracking his fingers impatiently.) Quick! Quick! Where's my augur's rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)\n\nZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.\n\n(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)\n\nHOURS You may touch my.\n\nCAVALIERS May I touch your?\n\nHOURS O, but lightly!\n\nCAVALIERS O, so lightly!\n\nTHE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.\n\n(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nZOE (Twisting, her hand to her brow.) O!\n\nMAGINNI Los tiroirs! Cha\u00eene de dames! La corbeille! Dos \u00e0 dos!\n\n(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)\n\nZOE I'm giddy.\n\n(She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)\n\nMAGINNI Boulang\u00e8re! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!\n\n(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)\n\nMAGINNI Dansez avec vos dames! Changes de dames! Donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! Remerciez!\n\nTHE PIANOLA\n\nBest, best of all,\nBaraabum!\n\n\nKITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!\n\n(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.\n\nZOE Yorkshire through and through. Come on all!\n\n(She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)\n\nSTEPHEN Pas seul!\n\n(He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. Bloombella, Kittylynch, Florryzoe, jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. Toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA\n\nThough she's a factory lass\nAnd wears no fancy clothes.\n\n\n(Closeclutched swift swifter with glareblareflare scudding they scotlootshoot lumbering by.

Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.\n\n\nZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!\n\n\nFLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.\n\n\nBLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!\n\n\nBELLA Police!\n\n\n(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)\nBELLA (Screams.) After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam.

I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 26, "api_path": "/songs/3580", "artist_names": "\"Weird Al\" Yankovic", "full_title": "Amish Paradise by\u00a0\"Weird\u00a0Al\" Yankovic", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/f77befad1088f549fffc1a7e389b375f.300x115x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f77befad1088f549fffc1a7e389b375f.699x268x1.jpg", "id": 3580, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 5465, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1669810842, "path": "/Weird-al-yankovic-amish-paradise-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 22, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Weird-al-yankovic-amish-paradise-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1996, "month": 3, "day": 12}, "release_date_for_display": "March 12, 1996", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Mar. 12, 1996", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c56edac3e2f375d47b3ddf04059b4dcc.300x263x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c56edac3e2f375d47b3ddf04059b4dcc.600x525x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 11, "hot": false, "pageviews": 158390}, "title": "Amish Paradise", "title_with_featured": "Amish Paradise", "updated_by_human_at": 1669810842, "url": "https://genius.com/Weird-al-yankovic-amish-paradise-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/899", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f49f3174729ee32fcd17017a68b4acd4.1000x665x1.webp", "id": 899, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f0f694679171179c6c7cc0ede1204f12.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "w", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "\u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic", "slug": "Weird-al-yankovic", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Weird-al-yankovic"}, "artist": "\u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic", "lyrics": "Amish Paradise Lyrics[Verse 1]\nAs I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain\nI take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain\nBut that's just perfect for an Amish like me\nYou know, I shun fancy things like electricity\nAt 4:30 in the mornin' I'm milkin' cows\nJebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows, fool\nAnd I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that\nEven Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone\nI'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline\nGot a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin\nBut if I finish all of my chores, and you finish thine\nThen tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699\n[Chorus]\nWe been spending most our lives\nLiving in an Amish paradise\nI've churned butter once or twice\nLiving in an Amish paradise\nIt's hard work and sacrifice\nLiving in an Amish paradise\nWe sell quilts at discount price\nLiving in an Amish paradise\n\n[Verse 2]\nA local boy kicked me in the butt last week\nI just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek\nI really don't care, in fact I wish him well\n'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in Hell\nBut I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it\nAn Amish with a 'tude?

Killing\nTracks with the axe as I chop to the top\nFollow me and\nYou know I just don't stop\nYou can fool some of the people some of the time\nBut nobody got a flow that's dumber than mine\nSo keep on keeping on in that direction\nNo protection when you come in my section\nThe B bass is what we call it\nI'm bum rushing\nFlushing punks down the toilet\nSo jump in your cruise and put it into fifth gear\nAs we explode in ya ear\nYeah\n[Hook]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 14, "api_path": "/songs/68195", "artist_names": "Rappin' 4-Tay (Ft.

I know you finished that cut for the radio\n4-Tay: As a matter of fact Fly I just finished it baby boy, no worry about nothin', I'll be around\n\n[4-Tay]\nRegardless if I'm chillin' backstage or on tour\nWith my homie Young Fly even Al B. Sure\nNever hesitate to call me after I'm done\n'Cause homie I'm real and always true to my loved ones\nToo many wakes and funerals full of tears\nYou say there's something on your mind, well hey, I'm all ears\n'Cause ain't nobody thinking about the funk that you're choosin' it\nA lot of my homies stuck in the pen for life or losin' it\nCall up your folks you keep thinkin' about home\nRecorder keeps a peep and there's a block on the phone\nAnd all of this is enough to make a brother's nerves bad\nReminds me of a situation that I once had\nSpent that, spent this endless relentless tremendous women on my jock\nAnd don't nobody mind their business\nHe say she say throwin' salt about\nAnd chooses to talk about you cause there's nothin' else to talk about\nTalk about the show and the flow and all the clout\nThen be real with yourself and talk about and turned it out\nIt's not hard to compete when one who's name is poppin'\nA scared man can never win that's why I stay clockin'\nSticky like a cactus and I practice with tight stuff\nAnd trippin' on these suckers 'cause I know they ain't tight enough\nPut 'em on a platter like a stage and they get scared\nWaitin' for an intro from the Fo and I'm well prepared\nFools be huffin' and puffin' don't wanna see me about nothin' I'm down\nAnd if you ever need me Fly: I'll be around\n[Hook]\nWhenever you call me: I'll be there\nWhenever you want me: I'll be there\nWhenever you need me: I'll be there\nI'll be around\nLife ain't based on peaches and cream\nThis new generation holds a whole lot of dreams\nFuture doctors, producers, and mothers\nThe list goes on but now we killin' our brothers\nAnd if we killin' our brothers that means we killin' our own kind\nThese kids are watchin' now it goes to their mind\nRat-tat-a-tat cause you got a gat\nThen they want a gat you livin' like that?\nBut I'm not surprised just look what's televised\nIt shouldn't take a bullet for a brother to realize\nWe runnin' the hard heads, they runnin' the hot lead\nThen visit a death bed, I feel that's enough said\nEnough is enough, too much crime buildin'\nNo I'm not a role model but I'm thinkin' of children\nThat hang out late night 'cause they feel that's right\nTo watch the gunplay or bloody streetfight\nSo I'm a be around with a funky rap, G\nI know how it is and hopefully you feel me\n'Cause where I come from we rap to tight beats\nAnd if you don't hustle that's a day you don't eat\nMoms ain't cookin' she worked the week straight\nIf anything she's the one deserves a hot plate\nThe ghetto, the ghetto ain't nothin' to dream about\nTryin' to get out now that's somethin' to think about\nFools might disagree but I'm a stay sucka free\nAnd I'm so black and so strong they can't fade me\nBlacks are blacks worst enemy there's still no remedy\nYou got me for a grip still you call yourself kin of me?\nJealousy, envy, I see it in your eyes\nTell me what's wrong with seeing a black man rise\nI keep it funky it's pretty hard to miss it now and is it not explicit\nA message for the mind, and a moral for statistics\nSo I'm doin' what we call a roll call\nCallin' out the ones who won't rap to take a downfall\nI spit the street life and then I go underground\nYou silly, it's called versatility and I'll be around\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\nThings are gettin' crucial you gotta exercise your mind\nOr learn about life before you're left behind\nBut how you gonna get it right when you're not doin' right\nWhen you get mad all you want is a gunfight\n'Cause you ain't havin' that but understand that\nYou pretty hard to talk to holding a gat\nSo here's a new concept for your agenda\nYou'll live to be old if you control your temper\nThis tension causes a gang of madness\nNow you want funk that results to sadness\nSadness results to a lot of revenge\nAnd your so called friends really ain't your friends\nSo how do you know who you're able to trust\nIf you think about the past look what happened to us\nI never trust no one, I only trust myself\nOr I would've been a victim like everyone else\nIn friendship or hardship whenever you need me\nJust give me a call G I won't deceive thee\nThese fools be shakin' best believe they're fakin'\nJust tryin' to get a grip of all the money you're makin'\nThis ain't race a mind is a terrible thing to waste\nI drop the rap and J drops the bass\nTo the flow cause ain't nobody get with Fo\nI'm a down young brother comin' straight outta Frisco\nDroppin' a message out of love to your town\nLove your brothers and sisters and I'll be around\n[Hook]4Embed"}, {"_type":

a RAGE...\n\n[Verse 1: Wyclef]\nYou maintain to put a negro in pain you used to diss me\n\"You sure you wanna hang with old Eddie Kane?\"\nAin't nuttin wrong, so snap your head to the song\nWord is bond, you get wrong, I'll have you sing like Louis Armstrong\n''And I say to myself, what a wonderful world''\nBut what the fuck was so wonderful\nBout picking cotton on a farm?!\nThe harder they come, the harder they fall\nSo come one come all\nDon't stall or I'mma stick you like a voodoo doll\nDoors locked stop draw for the count, who drops?\nTen-nine-eight-seven-six-five-four-three-two-one-\n-you-slept-on-a-kid-from-the-boondocks\nOut of Hooterville land of the ill kill\nBellsburg Viking so you know I'm top ranking Phil\nSome say newcomer like the yuma but save the rumor\nCause I've been rockin ever since eighty-three\nWhen I used to rock my Pumas\nRap, narcotic psychotic, so hear the statistic\nOne out of ten, I'm passin' the mic next time I'll get wicked\nHeard the man who went before, got intimated\nYou tried to gas me up, too much gas, you got intoxicated\nYou wasn't ready for the real'n, dealin', chillin'\nWyclef, no

fifty not guns or cops\nNow here's the heavyweight knocker, the freedom fighter\nNatural rhythm rock a mic I always rhyme I'm never drinkin vodka\nAny old style, I throw it in a locker\n\n[Verse 3:

"lyrics": "Play Something Dancy (Excerpt) LyricsRun to the Hills\nBefore I started working at a strip club, I naively assumed that all strippers danced to Motley Crue, Guns N\u2019 Roses, ACDC, or some other type of hair metal or butt rock. All of those bands had strippers in their videos, so it made perfect sense to me. Within my first week at the Doll House, I realized that I was sorely mistaken. Strippers might have danced to Motley Crue in the late eighties or early nineties, and occasionally you may walk into a strip club and see a girl dancing to a Poison song because her middle-aged regular requested it, but these days, the vast majority prefer to dance to hip-hop, rap, and in my opinion, one of the worst music genres of all, contemporary R&B.\n\nNow, I consider myself to have a relatively diverse taste in music. As a vinyl enthusiast with several thousand records in my collection, my taste runs the gamut from The Misfits to 2Pac. But I have a difficult time accepting contemporary R&B as a listenable music genre. It\u2019s almost worse than modern country music, which is, inarguably, the Special Olympics of music. For me, both are a slow and painful listening experience. I\u2019d prefer to listen to A Night at the Roxbury soundtrack in its entirety followed by Nickelback\u2019s Greatest Hits than be subjected to a half hour of consecutive contemporary R&B songs. I make use of the term \u201ccontemporary R&B\u201d in an effort to distinguish it from the R&B of the fifties, sixties, and seventies. James Brown, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, and The Isley Brothers are all classified within the R&B/Soul genre and are amazing artists deserving of utmost respect. I\u2019m sure they were dismayed to see their musical creation evolve into a base, lurid form of adolescent sexual expression. It has become the mating soundtrack for the dim-witted and linguistically challenged. James Brown and Al Green would never have used these song titles: \u201cFeelin\u2019 On Your Booty,\u201d \u201cU Remind Me of My Jeep,\u201d \u201cKnockin\u2019 Da Boots,\u201d \u201cFreakin\u2019 You,\u201d \u201cShorty (Got Her Eyes on Me),\u201d \u201cI Can Tell U Wanna Fuck,\u201d or my personal favorite, \u201cT-Shirt and Panties.\u201d I had never encountered the contemporary R&B genre prior to working at the Doll House. The names Jodeci, R. Kelly, and H-Town were foreign concepts to me. But within that first week of employment, I realized that contemporary R&B is the preferred music of the modern-day stripper. They like it\u2014believe me, I\u2019ve inquired\u2014because it makes them feel \u201csexy\u201d or the more common explanation, \u201cI\u2019m feeling tired and R&B is easy music to dance to.\u201d The latter is the primary reason they prefer R&B because they can roll about on their backs onstage and earn the same amount in tips as the dancer frenetically wrapping her body around the pole to Aerosmith\u2019s \u201cRag Doll.\u201d\n\nThe first several months at the Doll House was a veritable culture shock for me. I had several books of CDs at my disposal, but not one contained an R. Kelly song. I not only had to pay close attention to the music selection of the night shift DJs, I had to assiduously write down the music that the girls requested, or I would not have been a successful DJ at that club. It took about a month of studying this wretched genre and several weeks of downloading songs from the Internet before I had a decent collection of contemporary R&B music. On a daily basis, I\u2019d pore through the Top 20 lists of all the urban radio stations and download the most popular tracks. Soon enough, I was able to play almost any song that a dancer requested, and they tipped me well for it.\n\nThat being said, if the dancer was a poor tipper, I couldn\u2019t care less what type of music she requested. I\u2019d select music for the crowd and for myself. And more often than not, it would be some type of rock or metal because that\u2019s what I wanted to hear: ACDC, Aerosmith, Nine Inch Nails, Iron Maiden, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Motley Crue, Danzig, Alice in Chains, Metallica, The Stooges, or even Slayer or Motorhead if I really didn\u2019t like the girl. Experience has taught me that Slayer is a very effective tool in teaching a dancer the benefits of tipping the DJ. It\u2019s difficult to describe the sweeping feeling of satisfaction I derived from watching a dancer who refused to tip stand helplessly onstage, with a look of pure and intense hatred on her face while Slayer\u2019s \u201cAngel of Death\u201d blasted through the club\u2019s speakers. All strip club DJs live for these \u201cfucking with the dancer moments,\u201d and we all have our anecdotes about how we played some outlandish song for a dancer we didn\u2019t like and she flipped out. I worked with a DJ who told me how he once played \u201cTurning Japanese\u201d followed by \u201cKung Fu Fighting\u201d for an Asian dancer who never tipped him. She flashed him a nasty look during the first song and furiously exited the stage during the second. With her exposed mammoth fake breasts bouncing from left to right, she headed directly to the DJ booth and spat in his face while cursing at him in Cantonese. We all have a cache of novelty songs reserved for the non-tippers. Donnie, who I worked with at the Ruby Club, always employed MC Hammer\u2019s \u201cU Can\u2019t Touch This\u201d for non-tipping dancers. Now I\u2019ve played \u201cBaby Got Back\u201d and \u201cIce Ice Baby\u201d a few times, but I\u2019ve never played MC Hammer for a dancer. Not once. I\u2019m not that much of a sadist. But like any experienced strip club DJ, I had my special cache of songs that I reserved for the non-tippers.\n\nAt the end of my shift, I\u2019d head downstairs while the girls cashed out with the managers and wait by the front door to make it as awkward as possible for them to leave without tipping me. Most of the seasoned dancers would tip or explain that they didn\u2019t make enough money that night and would take care of me the next time we worked together. I was satisfied with that explanation. Though it would have been better to receive some amount of compensation, it was also advantageous to remain on a dancer\u2019s good side. And when they did earn a lot of money, they\u2019d usually tip me double that night. But there were always a few strippers who were either new and did not know that it was customary to tip the DJ and security staff, or ones that steadfastly refused to tip anything at all. I typically worked with a dancer for at least two or three shifts before I classified her as a non-tipper and played Weird Al for her sets. After the second shift when I didn\u2019t receive a tip, I\u2019d confront her in a tactful manner and inquire as to why she chose not to tip. I\u2019d like to emphasize being \u201ctactful\u201d in these interactions because, though it\u2019s customary, a dancer is not required to tip any employee at a strip club. And if she feels like she\u2019s being extorted or threatened in any manner, she could complain to management, and the DJ or bouncer would be immediately fired. It was much easier to replace a security guard or DJ than find an attractive dancer who was reliable and a good earner. When I was promoted to night shifts at the Doll House, I replaced an egotistical, violence-prone DJ named Terrence who would confront non-tipping girls in the most untactful manner possible. Terrence, or \u2018Tito\u2019 as everyone called him, was in his late twenties and became friends with my manager Joe when they were both in prison. Tito also waited by the front door to be tipped, but if a girl tried to leave without tipping, he\u2019d grab her by the arm and corner her outside, demanding to know why she wasn\u2019t \u201cbreaking him off.\u201d He\u2019d refer to this as his \u201cgorilla pimp technique,\u201d and he informed me several times that \u201cfear is the only way these bitches learn.\u201d Understandably, he frightened a lot of dancers and was eventually let go because one of them complained about his technique. Conversely, I chose to use a much softer, more diplomatic approach. Standing by the door, I\u2019d watch the non-tipper cash out with the manager, and as she was walking by me to exit the club, I\u2019d say in a very non-confrontational tone:\n\u201cHey, Nadine, do you have a minute?\u201d\n\n\u201cUmm, yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just wondering if I screwed up your set. Did I play the wrong song or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cUmm, no. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I thought I played the two songs that you requested. Usually, if I play a decent set, most girls take care of me at the end of the night. I\u2019m just concerned I did something to upset you because I haven\u2019t received a tip tonight or the last time we worked together.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m new and didn\u2019t realize that we had to tip.\u201d Slightly embarrassed, she\u2019d rummage through her purse and pull out a twenty-dollar bill. \u201cWill this work?\u201d\n\n\u201cTotally. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it, and let me know if there\u2019s any new music that you\u2019d like to dance to.\u201d\n\nThis self-deprecating approach was very effective for the majority of cases but not all. I\u2019ve worked with several dancers who simply refused to tip regardless of how many times I\u2019d passive-aggressively inquire about the reason they chose not to take care of me at the end of the night. These were the dancers who I had reserved a cache of special songs for. Compared to my colleagues, I was rather patient and more than willing to give a dancer several chances to make amends. But after three shifts without receiving a tip, I had no choice but to ridicule her onstage with music, my only weapon. My go-to song for this situation was \u201cWhat Is Love,\u201d the first track from A Night at the Roxbury soundtrack. In fact, most of the songs from that soundtrack would work perfectly. I\u2019d follow that with Tom Jones\u2019s \u201cSex Bomb\u201d or sometimes \u201cManeater\u201d by Hall & Oates. All three of those songs are fast-paced and easily meet the 120-beats-per-minute requirement set by the management. For her second set of the night, I\u2019d make the switch to metal and play Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d as loud as I could followed by Danzig\u2019s \u201cMother,\u201d which was applicable because a good portion of the dancers were single mothers. At most clubs, the dancer is never allowed to leave the stage unless it\u2019s an extreme circumstance, like her water broke or she\u2019s in the throes of an epileptic fit. If she has a temper tantrum and storms off the stage because of the DJ\u2019s music selection, she will incur a sizable fine. Therefore, she has no choice but to dance to the music the DJ has selected for her. I could play the hapless dancer a seven minute Iron Maiden song, and she had to dance to it. And depending on how many occasions she \u201cforgot\u201d to tip me and which manager was working that night, I\u2019d play that Iron Maiden song in its entirety. The dancer would feign enjoyment for the duration of the song, and as soon as it finished, she\u2019d angrily storm off the stage and march directly to the DJ booth.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my way of saying thanks for not tipping me.\u201d\n\nThis comment would silence her momentarily, affording me an opportunity to continue by bluntly explaining: \u201cLike you, I earn my living primarily from tips. If you take care of me at the end of the night, I will play you any song that you desire. But if you choose to stiff me, well then, you\u2019ll have to dance to the music that I want to hear. And I love Iron Maiden. I really do. They\u2019re one of my favorite bands.\u201d\n\nShe stands there mouth agape, her maroon-shadowed oval eyes in their characteristic vacuous stare, and offers a feeble explanation: \u201cOh my god. I\u2019m so sorry. I totally forgot to tip you last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, actually, you forgot to tip me the last three nights that we worked together.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shit. My bad. My money sucked the last few nights and I just forgot to tip you.\u201d Reaching into her purse, she\u2019d pull out two twenty-dollar bills. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat works. What do you want me to play for your next set? And I promise I won\u2019t play any Maiden.\u201d\n\n\u201cUmm, I\u2019m feeling like in a rock mood. Do you have any Nickelback?\u201d\n\nTrying not to audibly sigh, \u201cYes, I do. I\u2019ll play some Nickelback for your next set.\u201d Say what you will about their wretched music, at least it\u2019s better than contemporary R&B.\n\nAfter this brief conversation and a few sets of \u201cnon-tipper\u201d music, most dancers would understand the benefits of tipping the DJ. However, there were invariably some who simply did not care and still refused to tip. The most resilient non-tipper that I ever encountered was a dancer named Barbie who worked at the Doll House for a brief period. She was a reasonably attractive blonde with some of the worst tattoos that I had ever seen. I shuddered every time I caught a glance of her My Little Pony tramp stamp. There were rumors that she was a Bulgarian model who had moved to America, fell on hard times, and consequently ended up at the Doll House. But none of these stories were ever substantiated. On more than one occasion, I had tried my self-deprecating inquisition but to no success. She\u2019d glance apathetically in my direction and hastily walk out the front door with nary a thought of tipping me.\n\nBut since she was new and easy on the eyes, I gave her five chances before I started fucking with her music. The other DJs at the club utterly despised her and had their worst music cued up as soon as she took the stage. After several weeks of not receiving a tip, I completely echoed their sentiment and played her some of the worst sets that I could muster. Barbie once worked one of my Friday day shifts, and only two other girls had shown up for work that day. This meant that she would have to go on the stage at least a dozen times. Casey was the manager for that shift, and he couldn\u2019t care less what I played for her. In fact, he stood in the DJ booth and offered suggestions:\n\n\u201cHave you played \u2018Mongoloid\u2019 yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t played any Devo. This set is going to be all Journey.\u201d\n\nI hit the play button and Journey\u2019s \u201cSeparate Ways\u201d blasted from the club\u2019s speakers. Barbie didn\u2019t seem to pay any attention to the music. She took off her top and held onto the pole and circled it repeatedly, lacking any sort of rhythm to her movements.\n\nWithout exaggeration, she was one of the most uncoordinated dancers that I had ever seen.\n\n\u201cDamn, Sanchez. I\u2019d wager that you\u2019d have more rhythm up there than she does.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen quadriplegics with more rhythm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever. I couldn\u2019t care less about her. I\u2019m just paying attention to the plight of Steve Perry. He\u2019s a man who loved and lost and may never have truly loved again,\u201d lamented Casey.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to the song, man. Separate fucking ways. He had to go his separate way because he was bound by the chains of love. Stop talking and just fucking listen. He couldn\u2019t take those distant eyes anymore and he had to go his separate way. And I don\u2019t fucking blame him. We\u2019ve all been there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve certainly been there. Steve might have been a tortured soul, but it sounds to me that he dated a lot of psychotic women. And didn\u2019t the keyboardist Jonathan Cain write this song?\u201d I asked, knowing full well that the question would irritate Casey.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about? Steve wrote all the major hits for Journey. Sure, he might have collaborated with Cain and Schon on a few songs, but it was all Perry. These songs came from his soul. He was a lover. He gave so much and took so little. And these cunts threw it in his face. Fuck them. I\u2019m with Steve on this.\u201d\n\nI almost forgot that I was DJing, and without bothering to announce Barbie\u2019s second song, I faded into Journey\u2019s \u201cSend Her My Love.\u201d She paid no attention and continued her uncoordinated, spastic dance routine around the pole. I looked over at Casey and noticed that he was pensively staring at the ceiling, his right hand gripping the bottom of his chin.\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always found this song to be profoundly agonizing. It really affects the listener at his core,\u201d I said.\n\nCasey ceased his rumination. \u201cI know what you mean. Steve feels deep remorse for his actions. But his actions were inevitable. It\u2019s not like he never loved her. I mean, what\u2019d you expect him to do? He\u2019s on the road so many nights a year. How could he adequately love a woman and raise a family with her? He tried, but ultimately, he had to let her go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, man. He gave what he could, but he knew in his heart that it would never be enough. But he still cared.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that he did.\u201d Casey sighed deeply, and we listened to the rest of the song in silence.\n\nI would\u2019ve continued to deconstruct Journey songs with Casey had I not looked at the soundboard and realized that Barbie had been dancing for almost ten minutes. I don\u2019t think she even noticed. In fact, I had to announce twice that it was time for her to leave the stage before she finally stepped down. Her next set consisted of Poison\u2019s \u201cUnskinny Bop\u201d followed by Night Ranger\u2019s \u201cSister Christian.\u201d Casey looked insulted by my choice for her second song.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked that you played this. I\u2019m no prude, but a song about rape has no place in a strip club,\u201d he said accusingly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re insane. \u2018Sister Christian\u2019 is about a young girl\u2019s coming of age.\u201d\n\n\u201cPay attention to the lyrics for a second and you\u2019ll see that this song is about raping nuns.\u201d\n\nWe both watched Barbie clutch the pole tightly and move her hips in stark opposition to the tempo of the song. \u201cThat girl really has no sense of rhythm. I think she dances like that on purpose.\u201d\n\nCasey ignored me and pointed his index finger in the air. \u201cListen to this part of the song.\u201d He looked over at me assuredly. \u201cHer time has come? See, the nun clearly has no choice. Her time has come to be gang-raped by the sex-addicted members of Night Ranger. They\u2019re probably intoxicated or high on coke and think it\u2019s a good idea to rape a nun. It\u2019s hard for me to listen to this. Disgusting. Make it stop.\u201d\n\nThough I thought he was reaching on this one, I faded the song out and put on the next dancer. For Barbie\u2019s next few sets, I emptied my cache of stripper torture music: Aerosmith\u2019s \u201cDude (Looks Like a Lady)\u201d followed by The Butthole Surfers\u2019 \u201cLady Sniff\u201d; WASP\u2019s \u201cAnimal (Fuck Like a Beast)\u201d and Neil Diamond\u2019s \u201cForever in Blue Jeans\u201d; Slayer\u2019s \u201cKill Again\u201d paired with Gwar\u2019s \u201cSick of You\u201d; Cannibal Corpse\u2019s \u201cMeat Hook Sodomy\u201d and Warren Zevon\u2019s \u201cWerewolves of London\u201d; Willie D\u2019s \u201cBald Headed Hoes\u201d followed by 2 Live Crew\u2019s \u201cFace Down Ass Up.\u201d\n\nBut it didn\u2019t bother her whatsoever. She paid no attention to the music I was playing and would walk off the stage without even glancing in the direction of the DJ booth. I was at wit\u2019s end. I had to unleash the nuclear bomb. The next set that I had chosen for Barbie would infuriate even the most tolerant of strippers. When she walked onstage for the final time that shift, I played my ultimate non-tipper set: Digital Underground\u2019s \u201cThe Humpty Dance\u201d followed by Color Me Badd\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Sex You Up.\u201d I have never met a stripper who didn\u2019t tip after being forced to dance to \u201cThe Humpty Dance\u201d two or three times in a night. But, alas, my efforts fell flat. These songs didn\u2019t seem to faze her in the least bit. I was about to relent and accept the fact that I was never going to receive a tip from her, when a young Mexican dancer named Heaven approached the booth and asked:\n\n\u201cWhy you playing all this wack shit for her? It won\u2019t do no good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? These songs aren\u2019t wack.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou trippin\u2019 if you think \u2018Humpty Dance\u2019 ain\u2019t wack. But it don\u2019 matter what you play cuz she can\u2019t hear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t hear it? Should I turn it up?\u201d\n\n\u201cStill won\u2019t do no good. She\u2019s deaf. She can\u2019t hear shit.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s deaf?\u201d The realization hit me like a punch in the groin. \u201cHow do you know she\u2019s deaf?\u201d\n\n\u201cI seen her talking to her man using sign language and shit.\u201d Heaven moved her fingers in the air pretending that she was signing a message to me. \u201cI was telling you to eat a dick in sign language.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice. Thanks for that.\u201d All of a sudden, I felt truly remorseful for playing all those songs for her. Though it made perfect sense, I had no idea that she was deaf. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve worked with her five or six times, and she still hasn\u2019t tipped me or any other DJ at the club.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t tipped you?\u201d Heaven asked with more than a hint of incredulity. \u201cShe don\u2019 make no money. The bitch is deaf. She can\u2019t hustle cuz the customers don\u2019t know sign language. Damn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. Now I feel like a dick.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should.\u201d She shook her head and sauntered back to the dressing room, moving her index finger back and forth in a \u201ctick-tick\u201d motion while mouthing the chorus of the song.\n\nWhen the shift ended, I didn\u2019t bother waiting at the door to be tipped out by Barbie. I felt that I should apologize for mocking her, but since I didn\u2019t know sign language, it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. I attempted to rationalize my behavior by acknowledging the fact that she didn\u2019t actually hear the music that I was playing for her, but that didn\u2019t lighten my conscience. On her way out, she walked by the booth, but I avoided her and pretended to be busy packing up my CD cases. I never saw her again after that shift. I\u2019d like to think that she found a job at a strip club for the disabled where she\u2019d have an equal opportunity to make as much money as the other dancers, but, sadly, a club like that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nPlay Something Dancy is available now on Amazon, Itunes Bookstore, and Barnes and Noble.5Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/3806315", "artist_names": "Nucleo Aka Tinta Sucia (Ft.

to get away\n\nI've got to get away\n\nAin't nothin' but the funk, baby!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI need a peace of mind, I'm stressed out today\nIt's about that time to make that get away\nDealing with the people I deal with everyday\nGot to find a place I can hide away\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nSo I can be away from the madness\nFar from the noise and the darkness\nIt's not too late, there's gotta be a way\nFor me to escape all this nonsense\nGet away\n\n[Chorus]\nI've got to get away, I've got to get away\nI've got to get away, I've got to get away\nI've got to get away, I've got to get away\nI've got to get away, I've got to get away\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey try to run my life but that's the way I live\nDo what I wanna do, 'cause it's my perrogative\nPeople always trippin' about the things I say\nBut I'm living for the future and I'm doing things my way\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nSo why does the world just keep on doggin me\nI have to leave it all behind\n'cause there's gotta be a way\nFor me to escape all this nonsense\nTo get away\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI've got to get away, I've got to get away\nI've got to get away, I've got to get away\nI've got to get away, I've got to get away\nI've got to get away, I've got to get away\n\n[Rap]\nYo check the groove\nB's kicking a flow\nReal smooth\nE double S-S\nWith some cess\nAnd it's a necessity to move\nSo hit it where ya fit in and let the rythm snatch ya\nThrow a good rhyme so watch what's coming at ya\nAs I release another Brown batch of jams\nThat slam\nAnd you can't touch so scram\nI know you cram to understand\nWho I am, damn by the way can I please get this dance?\nLet's not free lance 'cause I'm just getting started\nBelieve me that was nothing but a Brown party\nThat's going on and got it going on\nBob and Ted'd rated number one so flow on it\nAnd if you're in the house, pump your fists and say\nHo! (Ho!)\nSay ho, ho! (Ho, ho!)\nTed, bring me on back, bring me on back\nDance!\nThere it is, oh!\n[Chorus]\nI've got to get away, I've got to get away\nI've got to get away, I've got to get away\nI've got to get away, I've got to get away\nI've got to get away, I've got to get away\n\nNever in my life\nHave I ever felt that something just ain't right\nBaby\nBaby\nTired of all this mess\nUnhapiness\nI guess it's I just gotta get away\nGotta get away\n\nI don't wanna hurt nobody\n\nGotta get away\nGotta get away\nGotta get away\nPlease somebody\nIt just don't feel right\nBaby I can't sleep at night\nI need a peace of mind\nFar away from the darkness\nAnd you know it's\nI need someone\nTo take me away\nTake me away\nTake me away\nTake me away baby\nPlease B Brown is outta here\nCoast1Embed"}, {"_type":

PATEL\nYou seemed to have trouble last\nnight.\n\nPAT\nLet me just set the record straight\nabout last night. Hurting my mother\nwas a mistake and I hate myself for\nit, and I hate my illness and I\nwant to control it. My father, on\nthe other hand, had no trouble\nslapping the shit out of me last\nnight, which I did not return\n`cause I could've killed him and I\ndidn't. He's sixty-five years old.\nYou don't think I could've beat the\nshit out of him? I mean....\n\nDR. PATEL\nHe was scared for your mother and\nyou hurt him as well.\n\nPAT\nYes, last night was a mess. Okay?\nAnd I think he probably just tried\nto do his best.\n\nDR. PATEL\nPat, you have to have a strategy. I\ntold you earlier. You need to\nrecognize these feelings coming to\nyou, otherwise you will be sent\nback to Baltimore. So when you get\nthese feelings, you need to get to\na quieter place, and be at peace\nwith yourself, however you can.\n\nPAT\nYeah, but that's easier said than\ndone.\n\nDR. PATEL\nYou have to do it. You have no\nchoice. Excelsior.\n\nPAT\nYeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a\nletter I want you to give Nikki,\nokay?\n\nDR. PATEL\nNo.\n\nPAT\nWhy?\n\n64.\n\n\n\nDR. PATEL\nBecause you have a restraining\norder.\n\nPAT\n\n(SIGHS)\nWhat good are you, man?\n\nDR. PATEL\nWhy did you have this overwhelming\nurgency to see your wedding video\nlast night?\n\nPAT\nOh, I don't know, because I'm\nmarried and I haven't seen my wife\nin eight and a half months?\n\nDR. PATEL\nMaybe you think that Nikki's not\naround and Tiffany's an attractive\ngirl and if you get drawn towards\nTiffany, you will spoil your\nchances of getting Nikki back to\nyou?\n\nPAT\nNot bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't\nthink I'm gonna blow it with Nikki\nbecause Tiffany's a slut.\n\nDR. PATEL\nWhy is she a slut?\n\nPAT\nAfter the dinner at Ronnie's, she\nsaid, quote, \"We can go to the back\nhouse and you can fuck me as long\nas we turn the lights out.\"\nUnquote. And she still wears her\nwedding ring. So she's a loyal,\nmarried-to-a-dead-guy slut.\n\nDR. PATEL\nMaybe she just needs a friend and\nshe thought if she offers you sex,\nit will be easier for you to become\nfriends with her.\n\nPAT\nShe said she's not a whore anymore,\nbut she likes that part of herself\nalong with all the other parts of\nherself and can I say the same?\n\nDR. PATEL\nCan you?\n\n65.\n\n\n\nPAT\nIs that....? You're asking me,\nyou're really asking me that\nquestion?\n\nDR. PATEL\nYes.\n\nPAT\nWith all my crazy sad shit? What,\nare you fucking nuts?\n\nDR. PATEL\nPat, the silver lining thing is\nyours. I'm just giving back your\nwords to you. This \"crazy sad\nshit,\" as you call it, made you a\nhappier, calmer person with a\nbeautiful positive philosophy of\ngoing outdoors, working out, and\nreading books.\n\nPAT\nNo, not the books.\n\nDR. PATEL\nYou said Nikki's friends with\nRonnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if\nyou become friends with Tiffany,\nNikki will think that you're a\nkind, generous, large-hearted\nperson, who helps people in need,\nwho is basically thriving. So if\nyou help Tiffany, it will be good\nfor you.\n\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\n\nPAT RUNS. CAMERA TILTS UP AND MOVES BG. WITH HIM.

I'm sorry you find them so\nnegative, but I disagree. I think\nthey are great works of art that\nreflect how hard life can be and\nthey can also help kids prepare\nthemselves for the hardness of\nlife. In spite of all these\npositive developments, Pat, I have\nto say if it's me reading the\nsigns, I need to see something to\nprove you are ready to resume our\nmarriage. Otherwise I find myself\nthinking that we might both be\nbetter off moving on with our lives\nseparately. Please don't react\nquickly to this, but take time to\nthink about it.

Cowboys are\ncowards. And I'll bet you're such a\ncoward, you won't take the ten.\nPlus, are you listening, plus\nwhatever their score is at the\ndance thing. (to Tiffany) What's\nthat? Tiffany, what's that?\n\nPAT\nWhat? No, no, no, no.\n\nRANDY\nYou're crazy to give away that many\npoints. That's ridiculous! I won't\ntake that! However, wait a second.\nI do like the idea of a parlay.\n\nDOLORES\nWhat? No parlay! No!\n\nPAT\nNo, don't do it. Don't do it.\n\nRANDY\nPat, how do they run this dance\ncompetition? I mean, how do they\nscore it and everything?\n\nPAT\nI don't know, I don't know how they\nfucking score! We're participating.\nWe're not, we're not a part of it.\nThere are people, this is a high-\nend dance contest. I don't know. Do\nnot put it as part of the parlay,\nRandy. Don't--\n\n130.\n\n\n\nTIFFANY\nThey go by the Philadelphia rules.\nEach dancer is scored on a scale of\none to ten, ten being the highest.\nYou have to average the four\njudges' scores.\n\nRANDY\nOkay, score is from one to ten,\nright? And you guys are how good?\n\nPAT\nWe suck.\n\nTIFFANY\nWe don't suck. Pat's a beginner,\nI'm okay, we're happy just to be\ngoing there.\n\nRANDY\nAnd how are the people you're\ncompeting against?\n\nTIFFANY\nThey're good. Some of them are\nprofessionals.\n\nRANDY\nThey're good? Better than you?\nPause. Tiffany says nothing.\n\nPAT\nA lot better.\n\nRANDY\nA lot better. So if I was to say\nyou only have to score five, I\nwould be really very generous,\nright?\n\nPAT\nNo, no, that would be amazing if we\ngot five. Let's not get away--\n\nTIFFANY\nOh, come on, we can get a five out\nof ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a\nbreak!\n\nPAT\nWe can't get five!\n\nPAT SR.\nGive `em a five.

Braxton\u2019s 25 Best Songs: Critic\u2019s Picks LyricsOften when discussing the elite pack of divas who ruled the '90s and early aughts, Toni Braxton is cast aside.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be the case \u2014 there\u2019s way more to her story than \u201dUn-Break My Heart.\u201d\n\nKnown for her sultry, low-ranging contralto voice, Braxton -- who turns 50 this Saturday, Oct. 7 -- provided the R&B, pop, and adult contemporary hemispheres with a slew of signature classics.\n\nThe dramatic flare of these songs, matched with her film noir aesthetic and style, convincingly sold Braxton\u2019s extensive discography centered on the raging emotions of love and heartbreak. The smoothness and mature sophistication in her sound offered a lighter (and calmer) shading to the early waves of hip-hop soul and alternative-R&B that reigned supreme in the '90s.\n\nWell into the early aughts, Braxton would find herself pairing quiet storm vibes with hip-hop undertones.\n\nAfter an unfortunate dip in mainstream appeal maligned by label issues and personal matters in the mid-00\u2019s (although that period would bring notable deep cuts and plenty more \u201cwhat could have beens\u201d), Braxton regained her place in the spotlight with a Dancing With The Stars stint, a successful reality TV show alongside her sisters, and a critically-acclaimed reunion album with her mentor Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds.\nNow the legend prepares to release her ninth studio album, slated to be released next year, including her current single \u201cDeadwood.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the songstress' milestone birthday, Billboard ranks the 25 best Toni Braxton songs, including singles and deep cuts.\n\n#25. \"You Mean The World To Me\" (1993)\n\nAfter departing from her all-sisters quintet, The Braxtons, the eldest of the girl group embarked on a successful solo career.\n\n1993 saw the arrival of Toni Braxton, a self-titled debut that topped both the Billboard 200 and R&B Albums charts for multiple weeks. As the fourth lead single on the LP, \u201cYou Mean The World\u201d reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1994, thanks to the soulful swing of the hook dedicated to a cherished lover.\n\n#24. \"Why Should I Care\" (1996)\n\nFollowing up her debut with Secrets, Braxton reinvigorated the sound and format of quiet storm with arguably her best album to date.\n\nFull of ballads centered on dealing with an unfaithful soulmate, Secrets cemented the legacy of Braxton\u2019s signature blend of mature-R&B with breezy adult contemporary. In this deep cut, the crooner questions why she should care about said partner over a psychedelic guitar riff and synth reminiscent of The Isley Brothers.\n\n#23. \"Spanish Guitar\" (2000)\n\nMost legends can\u2019t say that their international single became a soundtrack staple for a Brazilian soap opera. La\u00e7os de Fam\u00edlia would help Braxton\u2019s Latin pop ballad become a mass success in its home country -- and ultimately a primary example of Latin music\u2019s influence on mainstream culture.\n\n#22. \"The Heat\" (2000)\n\n\u201cSpanish Guitar\u201d aptly oozed a sweltering mystique fitting enough for Braxton\u2019s third studio album, The Heat. Also incorporating that magic is the album\u2019s title track, a subtle jaunt working in the sounds of a tropical summer and a light, jazzy groove. No wonder why the ending question is \u201cdoes anyone want some ice cream?\u201d\n\n#21. \"Hit The Freeway\" feat. Loon (2002)\nEntering the new millennium, Braxton gained more artistic control from LaFace. She also felt a need to strip away some of her balladry and embrace her love of hip-hop \u00e1 la Mariah Carey\u2019s Butterfly. Braxton\u2019s first LPs of the aughts -- The Heat and More Than A Woman -- also embraced a sexier, borderline controversial side of the songstress.\n\nAs the lone single from More Than A Woman, \u201cFreeway\u201d joins a list of notable bangers produced by Pharrell\u2019s launching pad, The Neptunes. And thanks to its Loon co-sign, it also has a Bad Boys Records stamp of approval.\n\n#20. \"Trippin' (That's The Way Love Works)\" (2005)\n\nAfter leaving LaFace Records in 2003, Braxton signed to the record label abyss known as Blackground Records. If you're familiar with the label\u2019s nightmare stories revolving around Aaliyah and JoJo, it goes without saying that Braxton\u2019s first (and only) album under the label, Libra, didn\u2019t fare well commercially.\n\nThat being said, the LP contains the singer\u2019s peak unreleased singles and barely-existent promos. The highlight of this particular cut: A comparison of spousal conflict with \u201c12 rounds up inside the [Madison Square] Garden.\u201d\n\n#19. \"Talking In His Sleep\" (1996)\n\n\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d asks the diva throughout the epicenter track of Secrets. Here, she\u2019s confronted by her adulterous lover who accidentally spills his dirty laundry while snoozing.\n\nAfflicted by a 70s noir-jazz riff, \u201cTalking\u201d takes a page from Madonna\u2019s \u201cJustify My Love,\u201d balancing a scandalous spoken word narrative with a seductive hook.\n\n#18. \"Yesterday\" feat. Trey Songz (2009)\n\nIt\u2019d take five years after Libra -- and a release from Blackground Records -- for Braxton to deliver her next studio album. Serving as the first single from Pulse, the singer gets over her ex (played by Trey Songz on deluxe versions) by labeling him a day of the past. \u201cYesterday\u201d served as a testament to how Braxton manages to maintain her signature blend of genre formats years after her higher charting moments.\n\n#17. \"Hurt You\" feat. Babyface (2014)\n\nWhen Braxton started her singing career in 1989, Babyface became an integral component of her artistry. After going through separate divorces, the duo partnered up for the Grammy-winning concept album Love, Marriage, and Divorce, featuring this apology ballad that topped the Adult R&B Songs chart.\n\n#16. \"Midnite\" (2005)\nThis cut from Libra perfectly captures Braxton\u2019s ability to cruise along with the stripped melodic structuring of her songs. Her ad-libs and riffs shine throughout \u201cMidnite,\u201d making it a pleasant earworm in her deeper catalogue.\n\n#15. \"Love Shoulda Brought You Home\" (1992)\n\nAlthough \u201cGive U My Heart\u201d -- a duet with Babyface -- is credited as Braxton\u2019s official single debut, \u201cLove\u201d receives the honor of her first solo effort. Both songs appeared on the Eddie Murphy rom-com Boomerang, but \u201cLove\u201d would be regarded as the favorite thanks to Braxton\u2019s powerhouse vocal control and dexterity.\n\n#14. \"How Many Ways\" (1993)\n\nReleased as a single in 1994, \u201cHow Many Ways\u201d adequately reflects the finalization of new jack swing and the emerging popularity of its brethren, hip-hop soul.\n\nThe soulful declaration -- co-written and produced by Tamar\u2019s future husband Vincent Hubert -- sees Braxton recounting various ways she loves her man. The single served opposite to its double-A side, the Whitney Houston-esque \u201cI Belong To You.\u201d\n\n#13. \u201cSeven Whole Days\u201d (1993)\n\nRegarded as one of Braxton\u2019s iconic singles, the songstress recalls not knowing her lover\u2019s whereabouts for more than a week.\n\nWritten and produced by her dream team of Babyface and Darryl Simmons, Braxton\u2019s runs are what impressed listeners the most. She would later revisit the song\u2019s idea, slyly mentioning \u201cgoing seven whole days without hearing from you,\u201d on \u201cFinally,\u201d Libra's semi-mash-up of her most famous lyrics.\n\n#12. \u201cJust Be A Man About It\u201d (2000)\n\nSince The Heat was meant to embrace the more progressive sounds of contemporary R&B, Braxton also incorporated a little electro-hop on the album\u2019s second single.\n\nWith the support of a stormy atmosphere and womanizing voicemail delivered by Dr. Dre, the singer\u2019s hurt vocals shine in yet another convincing performance.\n\n#11. \u201cThere\u2019s No Me Without You\u201d (1996)\n\nThis deep cut earnestly emotes despair and a feeling of defeat after a break-up.\n\nHelped by backing vocals of the songwriter, Babyface, this Toni Braxton song\u2019s hook glides with a country twang --  the singer adopting the vocal patterns of the genre with a pristine R&B palette.\n\n#10. \"Take This Ring\" (2005)\n\nImma let you finish Beyonc\u00e9, but Toni Braxton had one of the best \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d of all time.\n\nThree years before we\u2019d receive an official dance and a Spandex-driven anthem from Bey, Braxton released a club banger echoing a similar sentiment. Fortified by a rocking go-go beat -- produced by \u201cCrazy In Love\u201d and \u201c1 Thing\u201d hitmaker Rich Harrison -- this dose of playboy-repellent serves as a faint reminder of a music moment somewhat ahead of its time.\n\n#9. \"Sposed To Be\" (2005)\n\nOn Libra, \u201cTake This Ring\u201d was the upbeat single deserving more; \u201cSposed To Be\u201d was the slow jam that could have been more.\n\nA great candidate for quiet storm or lovemaking playlists, this deep cut radiates an intergalactic tranquility -- and infectious bridge -- highlighting the finesse of Braxton\u2019s later discography.\n\n#8. \"Hands Tied\" (2010)\n\nThe second single of Pulse came as another one of Braxton\u2019s sultrier career moments.\n\nWith an urgent vocal performance, the allure of \u201cHands Tied\u201d exists in its zephyrous keyboard chords. The song also provided a glimpse into the softer side of Warren \u201cOak\u201d Felder, who\u2019d go on to produce for Rihanna and Demi Lovato.\n\n#7. \"Another Sad Love Song\" (1993)\n\nFrom its opening \u201coh\u2019s\u201d and \u201cwoah\u2019s\u201d over a slinky melody, the first official single from Toni Braxton played on R&B\u2019s knack for providing radio with sad tunes.\n\nWith an addictive hook \u201cracking [people\u2019s] brains like crazy,\u201d the song reached No. 7 on the Hot 100 and earned a Grammy for \u201cBest R&B Vocal Performance, Female.\u201d\n\n#6. \"I Love Me Some Him\" (1996)\n\nIf R&B radio is unanimously consistent with playing one Toni Braxton single since its release, \u201cI Love Me Some Him\u201d would hold that title for sure.\n\nRegarded as one of her signatures, the song was released as a double-A side single to the R. Kelly-penned \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To.\u201d The best part exists at the end of this cosmopolitan ode -- Braxton\u2019s vocal harmonizing with the instrumental stealing the show.\n\n#5. \"Find Me A Man\" (1996)\n\nToday, Secrets remains without a skippable track. It also contains the singer\u2019s best deep cut.\n\nIn terms of essential Toni Braxton, \u201cFind Me A Man\u201d shows the singer\u2019s ability to draw listeners into her raw emotion over a cerebral melody. Here heartbreak reigns as the songstress finds herself tired of being alone, dreaming up the irresistible qualities of her Prince Charming.\n\n#4. \"Un-Break My Heart\" (1996)\n\nStanding as one of the greatest power ballads to ever exist, this Hot 100 chart-topper is the central song of Braxton\u2019s career. Vibrant in grandiose-theatrics and a heart-wrenching chorus in the midst of vocal acrobatics, \u201cUn-Break My Heart\u201d would sit at the summit for 11 weeks.\n\n#3. \"Breathe Again\" (1993)\n\nAs these Toni Braxton songs age, this single from her debut still finds its way on R&B rotation today. Sparkling in Sade-centric balladry and Diane Warren lyrics, the breathy chorus and stagnant verses displayed by Braxton execute the song\u2019s intended moodiness.\n\n\u201cBreathe Again\u201d would become a No. 3 hit and earn the singer\u2019s second Grammy win for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female.\n\n#2. \"He Wasn\u2019t Man Enough For Me\" (2000)\n\nThe new millennium might have seen a new look and sound from the diva, but her anthemic spirit remained fervent. In the league of \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d and \u201cIndependent Women, Pt. 1,\u201d this song holds its own rightful spot.\n\nProduced by Rodney \u201cDarkchild\u201d Jerkins, this signature dance bop was blocked from the Hot 100\u2019s top spot by the stronghold of Carlos Santana and The Product G&B\u2019s \u201cMaria Maria.\u201d Today, it\u2019s revisited by those realizing a past flame couldn\u2019t handle it all.\n\n#1. \"Let It Flow\" (1996)\n\nPaired alongside \u201cYou\u2019re Makin\u2019 Me High,\u201d this double A-side single peaked at No. 1 on the Hot 100. Unlike its partnered uptempo jaunt, \u201cLet It Flow\u201d drifts like a slow-running stream guided by the presence of a hypnotizing guitar.\n\nStaying in line with the anthems Braxton has provided prior to and after \u201cLet It Flow,\u201d the song became a mainstay on radio, the Waiting To Exhale Soundtrack, and most importantly Braxton\u2019s performance catalogue.\n\nSimply put, \u201cLet It Flow\u201d could have been done by none other than the superstar herself -- particularly the mesmerizing ending.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1162003",

(That\u2005red-lip,\u2005classic thing? Check.)\u2005\u201cI need someone to help dye\u2005my hair pink,\u201d she says, and moments later, her ends match her sparkly nail polish, sneakers, and the stripes on her button-down. It\u2019s all in keeping with the pastel aesthetic of her new album, Lover; black-leather combat-Taylor from her previous album cycle has handed back the phone. Around the black-granite kitchen island, all is calm and normal, as Swift\u2019s mom, dad, and younger brother pass through. Her mom\u2019s two dogs, one very small, one very large, pounce upon visitors with slurping glee. It could be any 29-year-old\u2019s weekend visit with her parents, if not for the madness looming a few feet down the hall.\n\nIn an airy terrace, 113 giddy, weepy, shaky, still-in-disbelief fans are waiting for the start of one of Swift\u2019s secret sessions, sacred rituals in Swift-dom. She\u2019s about to play them her seventh album, as-yet unreleased on this Sunday afternoon in early August, and offer copious commentary. Also, she made cookies. Just before the session, Swift sits down in her mom\u2019s study (where she \u201coperates the Google,\u201d per her daughter) to chat for a few minutes. The black-walled room is decorated with black-and-white classic-rock photos, including shots of Bruce Springsteen and, unsurprisingly, James Taylor; there are also more recent shots of Swift posing with Kris Kristofferson and playing with Def Leppard, her mom\u2019s favorite band.\n\nIn a corner is an acoustic guitar Swift played as a teenager. She almost certainly wrote some well-known songs on it, but can\u2019t recall which ones. \u201cIt would be kind of weird to finish a song and be like, \u2018And this moment, I shall remember,\u2019'\u201d she says, laughing. \u201c\u2018This guitar hath been anointed with my sacred tuneage!'\u201d\n\nThe secret session itself is, as the name suggests, deeply off-the-record; it can be confirmed that she drank some white wine, since her glass pops up in some Instagram pictures. She stays until 5 a.m., chatting and taking photos with every one of the fans. Five hours later, we continue our talk at length in Swift\u2019s Nashville condo, in almost exactly the same spot where we did one of our interviews for her 2012 Rolling Stone cover story. She\u2019s hardly changed its whimsical decor in the past seven years (one of the few additions is a pool table replacing the couch where we sat last time), so it\u2019s an old-Taylor time capsule. There\u2019s still a huge bunny made of moss in one corner, and a human-size birdcage in the living room, though the view from the latter is now of generic new condo buildings instead of just distant green hills. Swift is barefoot now, in pale-blue jeans and a blue button-down tied at the waist; her hair is pulled back, her makeup minimal.\n\nHow to sum up the past three years of Taylor Swift? In July 2016, after Swift expressed discontent with Kanye West\u2019s \u201cFamous,\u201d Kim Kardashian did her best to destroy her, unleashing clandestine recordings of a phone conversation between Swift and West. In the piecemeal audio, Swift can be heard agreeing to the line \u201c\u2026me and Taylor might still have sex.\u201d We don\u2019t hear her learning about the next lyric, the one she says bothered her \u2014 \u201cI made that bitch famous\u201d \u2014 and as she\u2019ll explain, there\u2019s more to her side of the story. The backlash was, well, swift, and overwhelming. It still hasn\u2019t altogether subsided. Later that year, Swift chose not to make an endorsement in the 2016 election, which definitely didn\u2019t help. In the face of it all, she made Reputation \u2014 fierce, witty, almost-industrial pop offset by love songs of crystalline beauty \u2014 and had a wildly successful stadium tour. Somewhere in there, she met her current boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, and judging by certain songs on Lover, the relationship is serious indeed.\n\nLover is Swift\u2019s most adult album, a rebalancing of sound and persona that opens doors to the next decade of her career; it\u2019s also a welcome return to the sonic diversity of 2012\u2019s Red, with tracks ranging from the St. Vincent-assisted \u00fcber-bop \u201cCruel Summer\u201d to the unbearably poignant country-fied \u201cSoon You\u2019ll Get Better\u201d (with the Dixie Chicks) and the \u201cShake It Off\u201d-worthy pep of \u201cPaper Rings.\u201d\nShe wants to talk about the music, of course, but she is also ready to explain the past three years of her life, in depth, for the first time. The conversation is often not a light one. She\u2019s built up more armor in the past few years, but still has the opposite of a poker face \u2014 you can see every micro-emotion wash over her as she ponders a question, her nose wrinkling in semi-ironic offense at the term \u201cold-school pop stars,\u201d her preposterously blue eyes glistening as she turns to darker subjects. In her worst moments, she says, \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re being completely pulled into a riptide. So what are you going to do? Splash a lot? Or hold your breath and hope you somehow resurface? And that\u2019s what I did. And it took three years. Sitting here doing an interview \u2014 the fact that we\u2019ve done an interview before is the only reason I\u2019m not in a full body sweat.\u201d\n\nWhen we talked seven years ago, everything was going so well for you, and you were very worried that something would go wrong.\n\nYeah, I kind of knew it would. I felt like I was walking along the sidewalk, knowing eventually the pavement was going to crumble and I was gonna fall through. You can\u2019t keep winning and have people like it. People love \u201cnew\u201d so much \u2014 they raise you up the flagpole, and you\u2019re waving at the top of the flagpole for a while. And then they\u2019re like, \u201cWait, this new flag is what we actually love.\u201d They decide something you\u2019re doing is incorrect, that you\u2019re not standing for what you should stand for. You\u2019re a bad example. Then if you keep making music and you survive, and you keep connecting with people, eventually they raise you a little bit up the flagpole again, and then they take you back down, and back up again. And it happens to women more than it happens to men in music.\n\nIt also happened to you a few times on a smaller scale, didn\u2019t it?\n\nI\u2019ve had several upheavals in my career. When I was 18, they were like, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t really write those songs.\u201d So my third album I wrote by myself as a reaction to that. Then they decided I was a serial dater \u2014 a boy-crazy man-eater \u2014 when I was 22. And so I didn\u2019t date anyone for, like, two years. And then they decided in 2016 that absolutely everything about me was wrong. If I did something good, it was for the wrong reasons. If I did something brave, I didn\u2019t do it correctly. If I stood up for myself, I was throwing a tantrum. And so I found myself in this endless mockery echo chamber. It\u2019s just like \u2014 I have a brother who\u2019s two and a half years younger, and we spent the first half of our lives trying to kill each other and the second half as best friends. You know that game kids play? I\u2019d be like, \u201cMom, can I have some water?\u201d And Austin would be like, \u201cMom, can I have some water?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cHe\u2019s copying me.\u201d And he\u2019d be like, \u201cHe\u2019s copying me.\u201d Always in a really obnoxious voice that sounds all twisted. That\u2019s what it felt like in 2016. So I decided to just say nothing. It wasn\u2019t really a decision. It was completely involuntary.\n\nBut you also had good things happen in your life at the same time \u2014 that\u2019s part of Reputation.\n\nThe moments of my true story on that album are songs like \u201cDelicate,\u201d \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day,\u201d \u201cCall It What You Want,\u201d \u201cDress.\u201d The one-two punch, bait-and-switch of Reputation is that it was actually a love story. It was a love story in amongst chaos. All the weaponized sort of metallic battle anthems were what was going on outside. That was the battle raging on that I could see from the windows, and then there was what was happening inside my world \u2014 my newly quiet, cozy world that was happening on my own terms for the first time.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It\u2019s weird, because in some of the worst times of my career, and reputation, dare I say, I had some of the most beautiful times \u2014 in my quiet life that I chose to have. And I had some of the most incredible memories with the friends I now knew cared about me, even if everyone hated me. The bad stuff was really significant and damaging. But the good stuff will endure. The good lessons \u2014 you realize that you can\u2019t just show your life to people.\n\nMeaning?\nI used to be like a golden retriever, just walking up to everybody, like, wagging my tail. \u201cSure, yeah, of course! What do you want to know? What do you need?\u201d Now, I guess, I have to be a little bit more like a fox.\n\nDo your regrets on that extend to the way the \u201cgirl squad\u201d thing was perceived?\n\nYeah, I never would have imagined that people would have thought, \u201cThis is a clique that wouldn\u2019t have accepted me if I wanted to be in it.\u201d Holy shit, that hit me like a ton of bricks. I was like, \u201cOh, this did not go the way that I thought it was going to go.\u201d I thought it was going to be we can still stick together, just like men are allowed to do. The patriarchy allows men to have bro packs. If you\u2019re a male artist, there\u2019s an understanding that you have respect for your counterparts.\n\nWhereas women are expected to be feuding with each other?\n\nIt\u2019s assumed that we hate each other. Even if we\u2019re smiling and photographed together with our arms around each other, it\u2019s assumed there\u2019s a knife in our pocket.\n\nHow much of a danger was there of falling into that thought pattern yourself?\nThe messaging is dangerous, yes. Nobody is immune, because we\u2019re a product of what society and peer groups and now the internet tells us, unless we learn differently from experience.\n\nYou once sang about a star who \u201ctook the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.\u201d In 2016, you wrote in your journal, \u201cThis summer is the apocalypse.\u201d How close did you come to quitting altogether?\n\nI definitely thought about that a lot. I thought about how words are my only way of making sense of the world and expressing myself \u2014 and now any words I say or write are being twisted against me. People love a hate frenzy. It\u2019s like piranhas. People had so much fun hating me, and they didn\u2019t really need very many reasons to do it. I felt like the situation was pretty hopeless. I wrote a lot of really aggressively bitter poems constantly. I wrote a lot of think pieces that I knew I\u2019d never publish, about what it\u2019s like to feel like you\u2019re in a shame spiral. And I couldn\u2019t figure out how to learn from it. Because I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what I did that was so wrong. That was really hard for me, because I cannot stand it when people can\u2019t take criticism. So I try to self-examine, and even though that\u2019s really hard and hurts a lot sometimes, I really try to understand where people are coming from when they don\u2019t like me. And I completely get why people wouldn\u2019t like me. Because, you know, I\u2019ve had my insecurities say those things \u2014 and things 1,000 times worse.\n\nBut some of your former critics have become your friends, right?\n\nSome of my best friendships came from people publicly criticizing me and then it opening up a conversation. Hayley Kiyoko was doing an interview and she made an example about how I get away with singing about straight relationships and people don\u2019t give me shit the way they give her shit for singing about girls \u2014 and it\u2019s totally valid. Like, Ella \u2014 Lorde \u2014 the first thing she ever said about me publicly was a criticism of my image or whatever. But I can\u2019t really respond to someone saying, \u201cYou, as a human being, are fake.\u201d And if they say you\u2019re playing the victim, that completely undermines your ability to ever verbalize how you feel unless it\u2019s positive. So, OK, should I just smile all the time and never say anything hurts me? Because that\u2019s really fake. Or should I be real about how I\u2019m feeling and have valid, legitimate responses to things that happened to me in my life? But wait, would that be playing the victim?\n\nHow do you escape that mental trap?\n\nSince I was 15 years old, if people criticized me for something, I changed it. So you realize you might be this amalgamation of criticisms that were hurled at you, and not an actual person who\u2019s made any of these choices themselves. And so I decided I needed to live a quiet life, because a quiet personal life invites no discussion, dissection, and debate. I didn\u2019t realize I was inviting people to feel they had the right to sort of play my life like a video game.\n\n\u201cThe old Taylor can\u2019t come to the phone right now. Why? Because she\u2019s dead!\u201d was funny \u2014 but how seriously should we take it?\n\nThere\u2019s a part of me that definitely is always going to be different. I needed to grow up in many ways. I needed to make boundaries, to figure out what was mine and what was the public\u2019s. That old version of me that shares unfailingly and unblinkingly with a world that is probably not fit to be shared with? I think that\u2019s gone. But it was definitely just, like, a fun moment in the studio with me and Jack [Antonoff] where I wanted to play on the idea of a phone call \u2014 because that\u2019s how all of this started, a stupid phone call I shouldn\u2019t have picked up.\n\nIt would have been much easier if that\u2019s what you\u2019d just said.\nIt would have been so, so great if I would have just said that [laughs].\n\nSome of the Lover iconography does suggest old Taylor\u2019s return, though.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever leaned into the old version of myself more creatively than I have on this album, where it\u2019s very, very autobiographical. But also moments of extreme catchiness and moments of extreme personal confession.\n\nDid you do anything wrong from your perspective in dealing with that phone call? Is there anything you regret?\nThe world didn\u2019t understand the context and the events that led up to it. Because nothing ever just happens like that without some lead-up. Some events took place to cause me to be pissed off when he called me a bitch. That was not just a singular event. Basically, I got really sick of the dynamic between he and I. And that wasn\u2019t just based on what happened on that phone call and with that song \u2014 it was kind of a chain reaction of things.\n\nI started to feel like we reconnected, which felt great for me \u2014 because all I ever wanted my whole career after that thing happened in 2009 was for him to respect me. When someone doesn\u2019t respect you so loudly and says you literally don\u2019t deserve to be here \u2014 I just so badly wanted that respect from him, and I hate that about myself, that I was like, \u201cThis guy who\u2019s antagonizing me, I just want his approval.\u201d But that\u2019s where I was. And so we\u2019d go to dinner and stuff. And I was so happy, because he would say really nice things about my music. It just felt like I was healing some childhood rejection or something from when I was 19. But the 2015 VMAs come around. He\u2019s getting the Vanguard Award. He called me up beforehand \u2014 I didn\u2019t illegally record it, so I can\u2019t play it for you. But he called me up, maybe a week or so before the event, and we had maybe over an hourlong conversation, and he\u2019s like, \u201cI really, really would like for you to present this Vanguard Award to me, this would mean so much to me,\u201d and went into all the reasons why it means so much, because he can be so sweet. He can be the sweetest. And I was so stoked that he asked me that. And so I wrote this speech up, and then we get to the VMAs and I make this speech and he screams, \u201cMTV got Taylor Swift up here to present me this award for ratings!\u201d [His exact words: \u201cYou know how many times they announced Taylor was going to give me the award \u2019cause it got them more ratings?\u201d] And I\u2019m standing in the audience with my arm around his wife, and this chill ran through my body. I realized he is so two-faced. That he wants to be nice to me behind the scenes, but then he wants to look cool, get up in front of everyone and talk shit. And I was so upset. He wanted me to come talk to him after the event in his dressing room. I wouldn\u2019t go. So then he sent this big, big thing of flowers the next day to apologize. And I was like, \u201cYou know what? I really don\u2019t want us to be on bad terms again. So whatever, I\u2019m just going to move past this.\u201d So when he gets on the phone with me, and I was so touched that he would be respectful and, like, tell me about this one line in the song.\n\nThe line being \u201c.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009me and Taylor might still have sex\u201d?\n\n[Nods] And I was like, \u201cOK, good. We\u2019re back on good terms.\u201d And then when I heard the song, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m done with this. If you want to be on bad terms, let\u2019s be on bad terms, but just be real about it.\u201d And then he literally did the same thing to Drake. He gravely affected the trajectory of Drake\u2019s family and their lives. It\u2019s the same thing. Getting close to you, earning your trust, detonating you. I really don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore because I get worked up, and I don\u2019t want to just talk about negative shit all day, but it\u2019s the same thing. Go watch Drake talk about what happened. [West denied any involvement in Pusha-T\u2019s revelation of Drake\u2019s child and apologized for sending \u201cnegative energy\u201d toward Drake.]\n\nWhen did you get to the place that\u2019s described on the opening track of Lover, \u201cI Forgot That You Existed\u201d?\n\nIt was sometime on the Reputation tour, which was the most transformative emotional experience of my career. That tour put me in the healthiest, most balanced place I\u2019ve ever been. After that tour, bad stuff can happen to me, but it doesn\u2019t level me anymore. The stuff that happened a couple of months ago with Scott [Borchetta] would have leveled me three years ago and silenced me. I would have been too afraid to speak up. Something about that tour made me disengage from some part of public perception I used to hang my entire identity on, which I now know is incredibly unhealthy.\n\nWhat was the actual revelation?\n\nIt\u2019s almost like I feel more clear about the fact that my job is to be an entertainer. It\u2019s not like this massive thing that sometimes my brain makes it into, and sometimes the media makes it into, where we\u2019re all on this battlefield and everyone\u2019s gonna die except one person, who wins. It\u2019s like, \u201cNo, do you know what? Katy is going to be legendary. Gaga is going to be legendary. Beyonc\u00e9 is going to be legendary. Rihanna is going to be legendary. Because the work that they made completely overshadows the myopia of this 24-hour news cycle of clickbait.\u201d And somehow I realized that on tour, as I was looking at people\u2019s faces. We\u2019re just entertaining people, and it\u2019s supposed to be fun.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to look at these albums as a trilogy. 1989 was really a reset button.\n\nOh, in every way. I\u2019ve been very vocal about the fact that that decision was mine and mine alone, and it was definitely met with a lot of resistance. Internally.\nAfter realizing that things were not all smiles with your former label boss, Scott Borchetta, it\u2019s hard not to wonder how much additional conflict there was over things like that.\n\nA lot of the best things I ever did creatively were things that I had to really fight \u2014 and I mean aggressively fight \u2014 to have happen. But, you know, I\u2019m not like him, making crazy, petty accusations about the past.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009When you have a business relationship with someone for 15 years, there are going to be a lot of ups and a lot of downs. But I truly, legitimately thought he looked at me as the daughter he never had. And so even though we had a lot of really bad times and creative differences, I was going to hang my hat on the good stuff. I wanted to be friends with him. I thought I knew what betrayal felt like, but this stuff that happened with him was a redefinition of betrayal for me, just because it felt like it was family. To go from feeling like you\u2019re being looked at as a daughter to this grotesque feeling of \u201cOh, I was actually his prized calf that he was fattening up to sell to the slaughterhouse that would pay the most.\u201d\n\nHe accused you of declining the Parkland march and Manchester benefit show.\n\nUnbelievable. Here\u2019s the thing: Everyone in my team knew if Scooter Braun brings us something, do not bring it to me. The fact that those two are in business together after the things he said about Scooter Braun \u2014 it\u2019s really hard to shock me. And this was utterly shocking. These are two very rich, very powerful men, using $300 million of other people\u2019s money to purchase, like, the most feminine body of work. And then they\u2019re standing in a wood-panel bar doing a tacky photo shoot, raising a glass of scotch to themselves. Because they pulled one over on me and got this done so sneakily that I didn\u2019t even see it coming. And I couldn\u2019t say anything about it.\n\nIn some ways, on a musical level, Lover feels like the most indie-ish of your albums.\n\nThat\u2019s amazing, thank you. It\u2019s definitely a quirky record. With this album, I felt like I sort of gave myself permission to revisit older themes that I used to write about, maybe look at them with fresh eyes. And to revisit older instruments \u2014 older in terms of when I used to use them. Because when I was making 1989, I was so obsessed with it being this concept of Eighties big pop, whether it was Eighties in its production or Eighties in its nature, just having these big choruses \u2014 being unapologetically big. And then reputation, there was a reason why I had it all in lowercase. I felt like it wasn\u2019t unapologetically commercial. It\u2019s weird, because that is the album that took the most amount of explanation, and yet it\u2019s the one I didn\u2019t talk about. In the reputation secret sessions I kind of had to explain to my fans, \u201cI know we\u2019re doing a new thing here that I\u2019d never done before.\u201d I\u2019d never played with characters before. For a lot of pop stars, that\u2019s a really fun trick, where they\u2019re like, \u201cThis is my alter ego.\u201d I had never played with that before. It\u2019s really fun. And it was just so fun to play with on tour \u2014 the darkness and the bombast and the bitterness and the love and the ups and the downs of an emotional-turmoil record.\n\n\u201cDaylight\u201d is a beautiful song. It feels like it could have been the title track.\n\nIt almost was. I thought it might be a little bit too sentimental.\n\nAnd I guess maybe too on-the-nose.\n\nRight, yeah, way too on-the-nose. That\u2019s what I thought, because I was kind of in my head referring to the album as Daylight for a while. But Lover, to me, was a more interesting title, more of an accurate theme in my head, and more elastic as a concept. That\u2019s why \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d can make sense within the theme of the album \u2014 one of the things it addresses is how certain people are not allowed to live their lives without discrimination just based on who they love.\nFor the more organic songs on this album, like \u201cLover\u201d and \u201cPaper Rings,\u201d you said you were imagining a wedding band playing them. How often does that kind of visualization shape a song\u2019s production style?\n\nSometimes I\u2019ll have a strange sort of fantasy of where the songs would be played. And so for songs like \u201cPaper Rings\u201d or \u201cLover\u201d I was imagining a wedding-reception band, but in the Seventies, so they couldn\u2019t play instruments that wouldn\u2019t have been invented yet. I have all these visuals. For reputation, it was nighttime cityscape. I didn\u2019t really want any \u2014 or very minimal \u2014 traditional acoustic instruments. I imagined old warehouse buildings that had been deserted and factory spaces and all this industrial kind of imagery. So I wanted the production to have nothing wooden. There\u2019s no wood floors on that album. Lover is, like, completely just a barn wood floor and some ripped curtains flowing in the breeze, and fields of flowers and, you know, velvet.\n\nHow did you come to use high school metaphors to touch on politics with \u201cMiss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince\u201d?\n\nThere are so many influences that go into that particular song. I wrote it a couple of months after midterm elections, and I wanted to take the idea of politics and pick a metaphorical place for that to exist. And so I was thinking about a traditional American high school, where there\u2019s all these kinds of social events that could make someone feel completely alienated. And I think a lot of people in our political landscape are just feeling like we need to huddle up under the bleachers and figure out a plan to make things better.\n\nI feel like your Fall Out Boy fandom might\u2019ve slipped out in that title.\n\nI love Fall Out Boy so much. Their songwriting really influenced me, lyrically, maybe more than anyone else. They take a phrase and they twist it. \u201cLoaded God complex/Cock it and pull it\u201d? When I heard that, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m dreaming.\u201d\n\nYou sing about \u201cAmerican stories burning before me.\u201d Do you mean the illusions of what America is?\n\nIt\u2019s about the illusions of what I thought America was before our political landscape took this turn, and that naivete that we used to have about it. And it\u2019s also the idea of people who live in America, who just want to live their lives, make a living, have a family, love who they love, and watching those people lose their rights, or watching those people feel not at home in their home. I have that line \u201cI see the high-fives between the bad guys\u201d because not only are some really racist, horrific undertones now becoming overtones in our political climate, but the people who are representing those concepts and that way of looking at the world are celebrating loudly, and it\u2019s horrific.\n\nYou\u2019re in this weird place of being a blond, blue-eyed pop star in this era \u2014 to the point where until you endorsed some Democratic candidates, right-wingers, and worse, assumed you were on their side.\n\nI don\u2019t think they do anymore. Yeah, that was jarring, and I didn\u2019t hear about that until after it had happened. Because at this point, I, for a very long time, I didn\u2019t have the internet on my phone, and my team and my family were really worried about me because I was not in a good place. And there was a lot of stuff that they just dealt with without telling me about it. Which is the only time that\u2019s ever happened in my career. I\u2019m always in the pilot seat, trying to fly the plane that is my career in exactly the direction I want to take it. But there was a time when I just had to throw my hands up and say, \u201cGuys, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t do this. I need you to just take over for me and I\u2019m just going to disappear.\u201d\n\nAre you referring to when a white-supremacist site suggested you were on their team?\n\nI didn\u2019t even see that, but, like, if that happened, that\u2019s just disgusting. There\u2019s literally nothing worse than white supremacy. It\u2019s repulsive. There should be no place for it. Really, I keep trying to learn as much as I can about politics, and it\u2019s become something I\u2019m now obsessed with, whereas before, I was living in this sort of political ambivalence, because the person I voted for had always won. We were in such an amazing time when Obama was president because foreign nations respected us. We were so excited to have this dignified person in the White House. My first election was voting for him when he made it into office, and then voting to re-elect him. I think a lot of people are like me, where they just didn\u2019t really know that this could happen. But I\u2019m just focused on the 2020 election. I\u2019m really focused on it. I\u2019m really focused on how I can help and not hinder. Because I also don\u2019t want it to backfire again, because I do feel that the celebrity involvement with Hillary\u2019s campaign was used against her in a lot of ways.\n\nYou took a lot of heat for not getting involved. Does any part of you regret that you just didn\u2019t say \u201cfuck it\u201d and gotten more specific when you said to vote that November?\n\nTotally. Yeah, I regret a lot of things all the time. It\u2019s like a daily ritual.\n\nWere you just convinced that it would backfire?\n\nThat\u2019s literally what it was. Yeah. It\u2019s a very powerful thing when you legitimately feel like numbers have proven that pretty much everyone hates you. Like, quantifiably. That\u2019s not me being dramatic. And you know that.\n\nThere were a lot of people in those stadiums.\n\nIt\u2019s true. But that was two years later.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I do think, as a party, we need to be more of a team. With Republicans, if you\u2019re wearing that red hat, you\u2019re one of them. And if we\u2019re going to do anything to change what\u2019s happening, we need to stick together. We need to stop dissecting why someone\u2019s on our side or if they\u2019re on our side in the right way or if they phrased it correctly. We need to not have the right kind of Democrat and the wrong kind of Democrat. We need to just be like, \u201cYou\u2019re a Democrat? Sick. Get in the car. We\u2019re going to the mall.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a hard question for you: As a superfan, what did you think of the Game of Thrones finale?\n\nOh, my God. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about this. So, clinically our brain responds to our favorite show ending the same way we feel when a breakup occurs. I read that. There\u2019s no good way for it to end. No matter what would have happened in that finale, people still would have been really upset because of the fact that it\u2019s over.\n\nI was glad to see you confirm that your line about a \u201clist of names\u201d was a reference to Arya.\n\nI like to be influenced by movies and shows and books and stuff. I love to write about a character dynamic. And not all of my life is going to be as kind of complex as these intricate webs of characters on TV shows and movies.\n\nThere was a time when it was.\n\nThat\u2019s amazing.\n\nBut is the idea that as your own life becomes less dramatic, you\u2019ll need to pull ideas from other places?\n\nI don\u2019t feel like that yet. I think I might feel like that possibly when I have a family. If I have a family. [Pauses] I don\u2019t know why I said that! But that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard from other artists, that they were very protective of their personal life, so they had to draw inspiration from other things. But again, I don\u2019t know why I said that. Because I don\u2019t know how my life is going to go or what I\u2019m going to do. But right now, I feel like it\u2019s easier for me to write than it ever was.\n\nYou don\u2019t talk about your relationship, but you\u2019ll sing about it in wildly revealing detail. What\u2019s the difference for you?\n\nSinging about something helps you to express it in a way that feels more accurate. You cannot, no matter what, put words in a quote and have it move someone the same way as if you heard those words with the perfect sonic representation of that feeling.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009There is that weird conflict in being a confessional songwriter and then also having my life, you know, 10 years ago, be catapulted into this strange pop-culture thing.\n\nI\u2019ve heard you say that people got too interested in which song was about who, which I can understand \u2014 at the same time, to be fair, it was a game you played into, wasn\u2019t it?\nI realized very early on that no matter what, that was going to happen to me regardless. So when you realize the rules of the game you\u2019re playing and how it will affect you, you got to look at the board and make your strategy. But at the same time, writing songs has never been a strategic element of my career. But I\u2019m not scared anymore to say that other things in my career, like how to market an album, are strictly strategic. And I\u2019m sick of women not being able to say that they have strategic business minds \u2014 because male artists are allowed to. And so I\u2019m sick and tired of having to pretend like I don\u2019t mastermind my own business. But, it\u2019s a different part of my brain than I use to write.\n\nYou\u2019ve been masterminding your business since you were a teenager.\n\nYeah, but I\u2019ve also tried very hard \u2014 and this is one thing I regret \u2014 to convince people that I wasn\u2019t the one holding the puppet strings of my marketing existence, or the fact that I sit in a conference room several times a week and come up with these ideas. I felt for a very long time that people don\u2019t want to think of a woman in music who isn\u2019t just a happy, talented accident. We\u2019re all forced to kind of be like, \u201cAw, shucks, this happened again! We\u2019re still doing well! Aw, that\u2019s so great.\u201d Alex Morgan celebrating scoring a goal at the World Cup and getting shit for it is a perfect example of why we\u2019re not allowed to flaunt or celebrate, or reveal that, like, \u201cOh, yeah, it was me. I came up with this stuff.\u201d I think it\u2019s really unfair. People love new female artists so much because they\u2019re able to explain that woman\u2019s success. There\u2019s an easy trajectory. Look at the Game of Thrones finale. I specifically really related to Daenerys\u2019 storyline because for me it portrayed that it is a lot easier for a woman to attain power than to maintain it.\n\nI mean, she did murder\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\n\nIt\u2019s a total metaphor! Like, obviously I didn\u2019t want Daenerys to become that kind of character, but in taking away what I chose to take away from it, I thought maybe they\u2019re trying to portray her climbing the ladder to the top was a lot easier than maintaining it, because for me, the times when I felt like I was going insane was when I was trying to maintain my career in the same way that I ascended. It\u2019s easier to get power than to keep it. It\u2019s easier to get acclaim than to keep it. It\u2019s easier to get attention than to keep it.\n\nWell, I guess we should be glad you didn\u2019t have a dragon in 2016.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\n\n[Fiercely] I told you I don\u2019t like that she did that! But, I mean, watching the show, though, maybe this is a reflection on how we treat women in power, how we are totally going to conspire against them and tear at them until they feel this \u2014 this insane shift, where you wonder, like, \u201cWhat changed?\u201d And I\u2019ve had that happen, like, 60 times in my career where I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, you liked me last year, what changed? I guess I\u2019ll change so I can keep entertaining you guys.\u201d\nYou once said that your mom could never punish you when you were little because you\u2019d punish yourself. This idea of changing in the face of criticism and needing approval \u2014 that\u2019s all part of wanting to be good, right? Whatever that means. But that seems to be a real driving force in your life.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s definitely very perceptive of you. And the question posed to me is, if you kept trying to do good things, but everyone saw those things in a cynical way and assumed them to be done with bad motivation and bad intent, would you still do good things, even though nothing that you did was looked at as good? And the answer is, yes. Criticism that\u2019s constructive is helpful to my character growth. Baseless criticism is stuff I\u2019ve got to toss out now.\n\nThat sounds healthy. Is this therapy talking or is this just experience?\n\nNo, I\u2019ve never been to therapy. I talk to my mom a lot, because my mom is the one who\u2019s seen everything. God, it takes so long to download somebody on the last 29 years of my life, and my mom has seen it all. She knows exactly where I\u2019m coming from. And we talk endlessly. There were times when I used to have really, really, really bad days where we would just be on the phone for hours and hours and hours. I\u2019d write something that I wanted to say, and instead of posting it, I\u2019d just read it to her.\n\nI somehow connect all this to the lyric in \u201cDaylight,\u201d the idea of \u201cso many lines that I\u2019ve crossed unforgiven\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a different kind of confession.\n\nI am really glad you liked that line, because that\u2019s something that does bother me, looking back at life and realizing that no matter what, you screw things up. Sometimes there are people that were in your life and they\u2019re not anymore \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. You can\u2019t fix it, you can\u2019t change it. I told the fans last night that sometimes on my bad days, I feel like my life is a pile of crap accumulated of only the bad headlines or the bad things that have happened, or the mistakes I\u2019ve made or clich\u00e9s or rumors or things that people think about me or have thought for the last 15 years. And that was part of the \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d music video, where I had a pile of literal old selves fighting each other.\n\nBut, yeah, that line is indicative of my anxiety about how in life you can\u2019t get everything right. A lot of times you make the wrong call, make the wrong decision. Say the wrong thing. Hurt people, even if you didn\u2019t mean to. You don\u2019t really know how to fix all of that. When it\u2019s, like, 29 years\u2019 worth.\n\nTo be Mr. \u201cRolling Stone\u201d for a second, there\u2019s a Springsteen lyric, \u201cAin\u2019t no one leaving this world, buddy/Without their shirttail dirty or hands a little bloody.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s really good! No one gets through it unscathed. No one gets through in one piece. I think that\u2019s a hard thing for a lot of people to grasp. I know it was hard for me, because I kind of grew up thinking, \u201cIf I\u2019m nice, and if I try to do the right thing, you know, maybe I can just, like, ace this whole thing.\u201d And it turns out I can\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to look at \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d in this context.\n\nYou pointing that out is really interesting because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve had to reconcile within myself in the last couple of years \u2014 that sort of \u201cgood\u201d complex. Because from the time I was a kid I\u2019d try to be kind, be a good person. Try really hard. But you get walked all over sometimes. And how do you respond to being walked all over? You can\u2019t just sit there and eat your salad and let it happen. \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d was about doing something that was so against what I would usually do. Katy [Perry] and I were talking about our signs.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[Laughs] Of course we were.\n\nThat\u2019s the greatest sentence ever.\n\n[Laughs] I hate you. We were talking about our signs because we had this really, really long talk when we were reconnecting and stuff. And I remember in the long talk, she was like, \u201cIf we had one glass of white wine right now, we\u2019d both be crying.\u201d Because we were drinking tea. We\u2019ve had some really good conversations.\n\nWe were talking about how we\u2019ve had miscommunications with people in the past, not even specifically with each other. She\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m a Scorpio. Scorpios just strike when they feel threatened.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m an archer. We literally stand back, assess the situation, process how we feel about it, raise a bow, pull it back, and fire.\u201d So it\u2019s completely different ways of processing pain, confusion, misconception. And oftentimes I\u2019ve had this delay in feeling something that hurts me and then saying that it hurts me. Do you know what I mean? And so I can understand how people in my life would have been like, \u201cWhoa, I didn\u2019t know that was how you felt.\u201d Because it takes me a second.\n\nIf you watch the video of the 2009 VMAs, I literally freeze. I literally stand there. And that is how I handle any discomfort, any pain. I stand there, I freeze. And then five minutes later, I know how I feel. But in the moment, I\u2019m probably overreacting and I should be nice. Then I process it, and in five minutes, if it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s past, and I\u2019m like, \u201cI was overreacting, everything\u2019s fine. I can get through this. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t say anything harsh in the moment.\u201d But when it\u2019s actually something bad that happened, and I feel really, really hurt or upset about it, I only know after the fact. Because I\u2019ve tried so hard to squash it: \u201cThis probably isn\u2019t what you think.\u201d That\u2019s something I had to work on.\n\nYou could end up gaslighting yourself.\n\nYeah, for sure. \u2019Cause so many situations where if I would have said the first thing that came to my mind, people would have been like, \u201cWhoa!\u201d And maybe I would have been wrong or combative. So a couple of years ago I started working on actually just responding to my emotions in a quicker fashion. And it\u2019s really helped with stuff. It\u2019s helped so much because sometimes you get in arguments. But conflict in the moment is so much better than combat after the fact.\n\nWell, thanks.\n\nI do feel like I just did a therapy session. As someone who\u2019s never been to therapy, I can safely say that was the best therapy session.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/563361", "artist_names": "Aaron

Lyrics[Intro: Freedom Williams]\nThings that make you go, hmm\n\n[Verse 1: Freedom Williams]\nI was at the crib, sittin' by the fireplace\nDrinkin' cocoa on the bear skin rug\nThe door bell rang, who could it be?\nThought to myself then started to shrug\nGot to the door, ding dong, \"Who is it?\"\nMy girl's best friend had paid me a visit\nSly as can be tight dress and all\nShe knew that I was faithful, I really didn't have the gall\nI tried to chill, she made the move\nNow, I know my girlfriend wouldn't approve\nI didn't realize my girl was settin' me up\nYo, my girlfriend didn't trust me, no\nYeah, but she lost control, I wouldn't take the bait\nI said, \"Chill baby, baby chill baby, baby wait\"\nMy girl bust in, caught us creatin' a boom\nShe said, \"Girlfriend?!\"\n[Chorus: Martha Wash]\nThings that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm, hey\nThings that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm\nIt's the things that make you go, oh, oh, oh\n\n[Verse 2: Freedom Williams]\nHere's how it started, just an example\nOf how another brother can trample\nRuin your life, sleep with your wife\nWatch your behind there was a friend of mine\nNamed Jay, would come over late at night and say, \"Hey\nI'll watch the fight\", I thought it was alright\n'Cause me and Jay we were really really tight\nSo damned close we had the same blood type\nMonths went by and my wife got big\nWe were havin' a child and I got another gig\nSo I let Jay move into the crib and chill\nHe had his own room and helped pay the bills\nThe time had come baby doll to conceive\nIt looked like Jay and I couldn't believe\nBefore my eyes in the delivery room\n\n[Chorus: Martha Wash]\nThe things that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nThe things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm\nThe things that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nIt's the things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm\nRobi-Rob, break it down\nYou might also like[Breakdown: Martha Wash]\nGive it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to

girl she really blew my mind\nInnocence and whole lotta class\nStyle  that could give you whiplash\nShe said, \"Hello\" and my heartbeat stopped\nShe was the world and I was on top\nTime went by, she filled my universe\nWe made love, she said I was the first\nMy boy kept tellin' me, yo, I don't know\nI think your girl's been playin' tic tac toe\nI'll ask my girl I know she only loves me\nWasn't I the one who took your virginity?\nThe look on her face read sorrow and gloom\nShe said, \"Yeah, why do you guys always ask that?\"\n[Chorus: Martha Wash]\nThings that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nIt's the things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm\nThe things that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nIt's the things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm\n\n[Verse 4: Freedom Williams]\nHey ladies, have you ever had a man\nGo away for business, come back with a tan\nComes home late at night from work\nYou cooked him dinner now you feel like a jerk\nSayin' he didn't have time to eat\nAnd he's not even hungry, he wants to go to sleep\nTo the bedroom he said his head hurts\nYou're only makin' love in radical spurts\nMysterious calls and the phone goes click\nYou say to yourself, \"I'm gonna hit him with a brick\nAin't no way he could be cheatin' on me\nI wonder who bought him those B.V.D.'s\nDressed to a T to hang with the fellas\nOut with the guys and I'm gettin' jealous\nComin' home late smellin' like perfume, fume\n\n[Chorus: Martha Wash]\nThings that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nIt's the things that make you go, oh, oh, yeah\nThe things that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nIt's the things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm\n\n[Chorus: Martha Wash]\nThings that make you go, hmm\nHmm\nIt's the things that make you go, hmm,

me\nLove at first sight, so rare, and so exciting\nOnly hope this love we found can last\nI'm not a man who acts this way but lately I can't concentrate\nAnd I don't sleep, just dreaming about you\nI try to reach you on the phone but voices there say you're not home\nMy heart aches, just thinking I've lost you\n\nOne more time\nSeeing your face in the moonlight\nOne more chance\nTo be caught unaware of this passion inside us\n\nLove at first sight, I know that this can't be happening\nNo, not to someone like me\nLove at first sight, it's hard to keep your balance\nMoving past the point of no return\n\nIf you need some time\nTo understand your feelings\nIf you need some time away\nI'll be waiting for you with open arms my love\n\nAll that night\nWe made love in the moonlight\nEye to

fam\nIll meet you at the zoo\nStop cutting all the branches, killing off trees\nKnow You watch TV, get up Rake leaves\nFuck updating a CV give employers the EP\nDon\u2019t mess with me, done got my degree\nPussy\nNo reason to don\u2019t lose friends unless she a 10, our friendship might end\nBuy diapers, this grown man shit, close your lip or ill close it with a closed fists\nNiggas sing to cops, like canaries\nI buy prophylactics you buy confectionaries\nShe want me, unlimited devotion\nShe making love... I'm going through the motions\nAdvances rejected, emotions neglected\nStealing wireless, my means to stay connected\nBest man, at everybody\u2019s wedding, maid of honour single? Her I will be bedding\nMe they wanna marry, seed they wanna carry\nCan't keep a job Can't\u2019 have a family\nHypnosis\nFix your halitosis\nSoar throat?, mononucleosis\nUnaware when the cornerstore, turned to casino\nProline super 7, scratch  keeno\nFounding member of the fanatastic 1\nDon\u2019t need a gun, kill you with my tongue\nRock new venues, tryna cope some bread so we can browse new menus\nSaga like tarius Ford like Taurus\nBad like chuck barry, chuck like chuck Norris\nFew questons, not to ask a brother, where you at? Who you with?\nIs there another? Don\u2019t ask? Don\u2019t ask? Why you need to know? Around the situation,  Now I got to tip toe, hell no, through the front door smelling like oregano\nVirgo flow\nDanger on Fire make competiton no-show\nOh no, yo yo walkin aftershock, Bela like rus Czech like solvaks\nIm never finished\nYo check me out now\nYou might also likeYo we who have sought must obtain what we seek\nNeed to reach a peak, can do it as a fleet\nYou get that?\nLet me run it back\nYo we who have sought must obtain what we seek\nNeed to reach a peak, can do it as a fleet\n\nBreaks over\nBoss on your ass\nHad til 1/4 past Now its almost half\n\nOut my face fool, see I's

nothing but captain cadet\nYou ain't heard nothing yet\nUtter death threats\nMurder every letter In the fucking alphabet\nShe just need to be female and bachelorette\nStay wise\nLook to the sunrise\nSurprise PR back all energized\nYou roll with the masses, I'm anti-clockwise\nWomanize Synchronize\nSend her home to you all tenderized\nMicrophone, molestation\nGive you all, fuck moderation\n\nConjuer in my laboratory, practising cadence & auditory\n\nBest rapper you ever heard\nAin't no rhyme for that, I just say that shit\n\nKeep your full stomach  & your empty soul\nI chill with the poor people in the fox hole waiting for the drum roll\nGet a foot hold, don\u2019t get trapped in they shitty loop holes\nYou better keep moving\nCause if you don\u2019t, they have you by the throat\nAnd have you on a boat\nSaying nigga\nKeep moving\nFloat\nIf you don\u2019t hope you brought a rain coat\nHard press, hard to get hard when you hard up in stress\nShirtless poor til the last breath\nSalavation Army shopping this weeks best\nYou better keep moving\nLike a tapeworm violate the infirm\nStressin while im rhymin' like your writing mid terms\nKeep moving\nIf you got one leg, wide eyed bed ridden\nAll you got is ears work, still in the rhythm\nFrail like a match, can't fill me like a snack\nDecimating  microphones\nReady like James black\nThe Oh no's back lyrical neck attack\nMet this kid named Cracker Jack\nFrom the outback no the comeback\nTryna make his life straight you can feel that\nAnger under wraps now he laid back\nDrowin in honies, hands fulla flapjacks\nDidn\u2019t watch his back like an almanac\nCats from his past, point, click & blast\nJack laid out, straight sprayed out, said what he get for the blabbermouth\nFree as a bird, feeling absurd\nWords can't describe like hard crosswords\nYo jack got ate up not keeping his weight up\nPeople you stepped on gon' get they day Cuz\nTreat us the same as we treat you\nAnd dont test us we roll as a crew\n\nAnd I don\u2019t want to leave you yall my people\nWe are all on this earth So we all fucking equal\n\nWell spoken, will never broken, no token hop when doors open\n\nDon\u2019t want to leave you yall my people\nWe are all on this earth So we all fucking equal\n\nDevastating, like Devestator the decepticon\nHit you 5 times bruise forms a fucking pentagon\n\nDon\u2019t want to leave you y'all my people\nWe are all on this earth So we all fucking equal\n\nWoman are hard to read like foreign books\nWhy are you tattooing your titties if you don\u2019t want me to look\n\nMan got me hungry, starving for days, using bottles of Visine all im seeing is rage\nCaptain inconsiderate, new moniker\nDropped Prufrock\nNeeded something harder\nShoulda spent my time doing shit Contstructive\nNot spending my time doing shit Destructive\n\nDon\u2019t want to leave you y'all my people\nWe are all on this earth So we all fucking equal\n\nMy friends, higher count of estrogen, fuck Glen, wheres Adrianne?\nDepression bout to set in, cause you ain't doing shows, I make Japanese Yens\nFrom Mozambique to Colorado's Pike's peak then to the Greek\nCheck my physique\nNext Budapest\nBrought along Jess\nGot a heavy chest\nFallin out her vest\nAt a protest\nTurned slug fest, put my feet on a cops head, make a foot rest\n\nDon\u2019t want to leave you y'all my people\nWe are all on this earth So we all fucking equal\n\nOut on this ep, defeat boredness, look for a girl to build and progress\nMet this princess\nHoney love sess\nOne track minded\nSelf interest\nDidn\u2019t call her back\nTold the cops my address\n\nI don\u2019t want to leave you y'all my people\nWe are all on this earth So we all fucking equal\n\n6 spliffs, 1 beer 3 shots of whisk\nComp gets burned like compacts disks\nLiving monolith, king like the fish\nGot mad plans not indecisive\nKnow where you live, headed to your crib\nNothing left to say, that it\n\nAnd I don\u2019t want to leave you\nYou are my people\nWe all on this earth so we all fucking equalEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/915328", "artist_names": "Voices That

Peter Cetera, Bobby Brown, Brenda Russell, Jani Lane, Luther Vandross]\nLonely fear lights up the sky\nCan't help but wonder why\nYou're so far away\nThere, you had to take a stand\nIn someone else's land\nLife can be so strange\nI wish we never had to choose\nTo either win or lose\nWe could find a way\nWe could find a way\nBut I won't turn my back again\nTurn my back again\nYour honor I'll defend\nSo hurry home till then\n(Till then)\n[Chorus]\nStand tall, stand proud\nVoices that care\nAre crying out loud\nAnd when you close\nYour eyes tonight\nFeel in your heart\nHow our love burns bright\n\n[Verse 2: Luther Vandross, Garth Brooks, Kathy Mattea, Gunnar, Matthew Nelson, Michael Bolton, Pointer Sisters, Little Richard, Will Smith]\nHurry home\nI'm not here to justify the cause\nOr to count up all the loss\nThat's all been done before\nJust can't let you feel alone\nWhen there's so much love at home\nWe're sending out to you\nAll the courage that you've known\nThe bravery you've shown\nClearly lights the way\nWe pray\nTo make the future bright\nTo make the wrong things right\nRight or wrong\nWe're all praying you remain strong\nThat's why we're all here singing along\nHey, hey\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nStand tall, stand proud\nVoices that care\nAre crying out loud\nAnd when you close\nYour eyes tonight\nKnow in your heart\nHow our love burns bright\n\n[Verse 3: Bobby Brown, C\u00e9line Dion, Luther Vandross]\nVoices that care\nAre crying out loud\nAnd when you close\nYour eyes tonight\nFeel in your heart\nHow our love burns bright\nYou are the voice\nYou are the light\nStand tall, stand proud\nVoices that care\nAre crying out loud\nAre crying out loud, ooh\nAnd when you close\nYour eyes tonight\nFeel in your heart\nHow our love burns bright\n[Chorus]\nStand tall, stand proud\nVoices that care\nAre crying out loud\nAnd when you close\nYour eyes tonight\nFeel in your heart\nHow our love burns bright\n\n[Outro: Warren Wiebe]\nYou are

(My Sister) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nMy sister, my sister, tell me what the trouble is\nI'll try to listen good and give the best advice that I can give\nSo, what's up with you this time?\nYour honey took a dive and now he's playin' with your mind?\nOh no, this can not be accepted\nThe feelings that belong to you must be protected\nHold up, time out, I shout, get it together sister\nTell him to be nice or ditch the mister\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart\nIt's a shame, the way you, hurt me!\n(repeat 2X)\n[Verse 2]\nGet back on your feet please\nI'm beggin' you to check out all your own needs\nDon't let nobody see you in a state of grievin', over the brother\nThere's another possibility\nWhich is for you to work out where you went wrong\nI guarantee to you that it will not take long\nFor you to make your mind up if the two of you belong\nYou know where honey's head at, and where he's comin' from\nGet it out your system, don't be another victim\nThis took the nerve, oh boy, he really picked 'em, whaddya know\nIt's time for you to show you're not sleepin'\nA progress report on the two of you, you're keepin'\nPeekin' through the peephole, to see if honey's sneakin'\nYou estimated right, that night the other weekend\nCollectively the facts should conclude the decision\nYou caught the brother in a terrible disposition\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart\nIt's a shame, the way you, hurt me!\n(repeat 2X)\n\n[Verses 3]\nThat's it, pack it up, be wise my sister\n'Cause the facts keep stackin' up, tell him, to kiss the you know what\nMake sure the door is shut, behind you\nI do believe the brother's out of luck, and stuck\nBut that's not, your P-R-O-B-L-E-M\nYou gotta let him go and let him know this is the end\nYou've been kissed, dissed, listed as a dumb one\nI hope he likes sad songs, he's gonna hum one\nHe's been a dum dum and that's the way it is forever\nThere comes a time, when you're at the end of your tether\nAnd you know, I think you went FAR beyond that\nSo it was bound to backtrack\nAnd smack you with an irksome vengeance as it attacks you\nMakin' sure you get the full entire view\nOf who's to blame, at the end, of the game\nThings will never be the same\nAnd it's a cryin' shame\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIt's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart\nIt's a shame, the way you, hurt me!\n(repeat til fade)1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1547672", "artist_names": "The Triplets", "full_title": "You Don't Have to Go Home Tonight

to run naked in a rainstorm\nMake love in a train cross-country\nYou put this in me\nSo now what, so now what?\n\n[Chorus]\nWanting, needing, waiting\nFor you to justify my love\nHoping, praying\nFor you to justify my love\n[Verse 2]\nI want to know you\nNot like that\nI don't want to be your mother\nI don't want to be your sister either\nI just want to be your lover\nI want to have you baby\nKiss me, that's right, kiss me\n\n[Chorus]\nWanting, needing, waiting\nFor you to justify my love\nYearning, burning\nFor you to justify my love\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat are you going to do?\nWhat are you going to do?\nTalk to me, tell me your dreams\nAm I in them?\nTell me your fears\nAre you scared?\nTell me your stories\nI'm not afraid of who you are\nWe can fly!\nPoor is the man\nWhose pleasures depend\nOn the permission of another\nLove me, that's right, love me\nI want to be your baby\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWanting, needing, waiting\nFor you to justify my love\n(My love) I'm open (My love) And ready\nFor you to justify my love\n(My love) To justify my love (My love)\nWanting (For you) To justify (To justify my love)\nWaiting (My love) To justify my love (My love)\nPraying (For

found his clothing scattered somewhere down the track\nAnd he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe had a home, love of a girl\nBut men get lost sometimes as years unfurl\nOne day, he crossed some line, and he was too much in this world\nBut I guess it doesn't matter anymore\n[Chorus]\nIn a New York minute, everything can change\nIn a New York minute, things can get pretty strange\nIn a New York minute, everything can change\nIn a New York minute\n\n[Verse 3]\nLying here in the darkness, I hear the sirens wail\nSomebody going to emergency, somebody's going to jail\nYou find somebody to love in this world, you better hang on tooth and nail\nThe wolf is always at the door\n\n[Chorus]\nIn a New York minute, everything can change\nIn a New York minute, things can get a little strange\nIn a New York minute, everything can change\nIn a New York minute\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd in these days, darkness falls early\nAnd people rush home to the ones they love\nYou'd better take a fool's advice and take care of your own\nOne day they're here, next day they're gone\n\n[Verse 4]\nPulled my coat around my shoulders, took a walk down through the park\nLeaves were falling around me, groaning city in the gathering dark\nOn some solitary rock, a desperate lover left his mark\n\"Baby, I've changed, please come back\"\nYou might also like[Verse 5]\nWhat the head makes cloudy, the heart makes very clear\nI know the days were so much brighter in the time when she was here\nI know that somebody somewhere can make these dark clouds disappear\nBut until that day, I have to believe, I believe, I believe\n\n[Outro]\nIn a New York minute, everything can change\nIn a New York minute, you can get out of the rain\nIn a New York minute, everything can change\nIn a New York, New York minute\nIn a New York minute, everything can change\nIn a New York minute, you can get out of the rain\nIn a New York minute, everything can change\nIn a New York minute, everything can change\nIn a New York minute, you can get out of the rain\nIn a New York minute, everything can changeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/4232450", "artist_names": "Genius",

Lyrics[Intro]\nGun is Cocked and Fired\nI'm King News and I come to you with the truth\nThe mean streets took six more lives overnight\nAll the result of gang-bang stupidity\nBy the way, you gangsters should know\nOne of your victims was a three-year-old girl\nWell, you gang members, you still don't get it, do ya?\n\n(With your bad self)\n[Verse 1: King Tee]\nIt's straight up madness everywhere I look\nUsed to be a straight A student, now he's a crook\nRobbing people just to smoke or shoot up\nUsed to have a crew cut, now he's a pooh-butt\nDropped out of school and he joins the neighborhood gang\nHanging on the streets selling 'caine\nTo his own people\nNow when I say people I mean color\nYou a stupid mother-\nI'm trying to stress the fact that you're dumb\nGet yourself presentable, son, and just come\nTogether, you better, cause pretty soon it's gonna be too late\nA message from King Tee The Great\n\n[Verse 2: Body & Soul]\nSisters, since we are the mothers of this earth\nIt's time we start being good mothers from the birth\nOf our children, no time for sleeping\nTeach them to fight and win for the right reason\nIt's your time, it's your life, live it\nProud to be black, young and gifted\nLifted by the knowledge and taking the right route\nGang violence needs to be wiped out\nA-L-M-I-G-H-Ty and E-Z-I-R-E\nWe see the F-U-T-U-R-E\nShould be a positive thing\nBody & Soul and you, we're in the same gang\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Def Jef]\nOne and the same\nEveryone came in the same chains\nCaught with the same aim\nBrain games and names changed\nTo protect the innocent by-stander\nLies, slander and the master-planner\nDestroy the black male\nCrack jail and semi-automatic\nFor static if the crack fails\nSo since we all talk the same slang\nStop killin, my brother, cause we're all from the same gang\n\n[Chorus: Michel'le]\nDon't you know we've got to put our heads together?\nMake the change cause we're all in the same gang\n\n[Verse 4: Tone-Loc]\nNow as a youth I used to get my bang on\nAnd on the ave get my part-time slang on\nDoing time for me was no joke though\nThey knew I was crazy, so they labelled me Loco\nKhakis creased, golf hat, feelin sporty\nLow ridin and tossin up a forty\nThinkin in my mind that no one could handle us\nThe downest brothers ever touched Los Angeles\nI found life was much more suitable\nCause I'm the brother that makes black so beautiful\nI ain't slippin or down with a head trip\nI'm talkin to all the Bloods and all the Crips\nThrow down your rag and get on the right track, man\nIt's time to fight, unite and be a black man\nTone-Loc is on a positive change\nCause remember, we're all in the same gang\n[Verse 5: Above The Law]\nBein' the pimps that we are\nWe're here to speak on a situation that has gone too far\nHere at home in the ghettos of LA\nWhere a young black brother's not promised to see the next day\nCause we used to clock on the streets before we made beats\nBut fools just lay and prey on the weak\nIt don't depend on the color of a rag\nCause if you got what they want you know they gonna take what you have\nCause violence don't only revolve from drugs and thugs\nAnd gangs that bang\nMost times it's a political thang\nYeah, a couple of spots'll get popped\nAnd if the government wanted to freeze it it could all get stopped\nBut they don't because they want it like that\nBecause the system been set up to hold us back\nYeah, Above The Law means that we can do whatever\nSo why don't we stick together?\n(You got it)\n\n[Verse 6: Ice-T; Hen-G]\nIce-T rippin the microphone the way I do\nListen close, my brothers, cause I'm talkin to you\nThe problem is we got a suicidal lifestyle\nCause 90 percent of us are livin foul and wild\nI say \"job\", you say \"bad joke\nI'd rather jack another brother, watch the gun smoke\"\nLivin in the fast lane flippin like you're insane\nYou won't stop until your blood runs down the street drain\nI got an idea, give me a minute\nAnd if it makes sense, then get with it\nWhat if we could take our enemies, feed em poison\nUndereducate their girls and boys and\nSplit em up, make em fight one another\nBetter yet, make em kill for a color\nAll my brothers need to know one thing\nNo matter what you think, we're all in the same gang\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't you know we've got to put our heads together?\nStop the fighting\n(Make the change)\nBecause we're all in the same gang\n\n[Verse 7: Dr. Dre and MC Ren]\nYo, we're not here to preach because we're not ministers\nWe're telling like it is cause Ren and Dre is like sinister\nReality speaks for itself when it's spoken\nA basehead cluck can't blame nobody for smoking\nYo, bullets flying, mothers crying, brothers dying\nLying in the streets, that's why we're trying\nTo stop it from falling apart and going to waste\nAnd keeping a smile off of white face\nN.W.A never preaching, just teaching\nThe knowledge of the streets to each and\nAll that don't understand, that's why we came\nTo let you know that we're all in the same gang\n\n[Verse 8: JJ Fad]\nThe J double, F, the a, the d, that is\nAnd if you want the solution to the quiz\nWhat's black and black, yo, and kills another?\nAn ignorant sucker that isn't labelled as a brother\nBut another\nSo now it's time we evolve\nAnd get together and solve it\nCause the world is revolvin\nAround a terrible situation\nOne will kill another for a reputation\nSo it's time we stop and realize that we're all the same\nYo Train, tell em (We're all in the same gang)\n\n[Verse 9: Young MC]\nBrothers killin' other brothers\nI thought the idea was to love one another?\nOpen up the paper to one more death\nIf y'all keep this up then there'll be no one left\nI try my best to set an example\nSayin hype lyrics over hip-hop samples\nNot just a brag or to boast but to inform\nCause we're livin in the calm before the storm\nYou see, I believe that the children are the future\nBut what's it all about if in the future they shoot ya?\nWe're all human beings, if we're cut we'll bleed\nAnd I want to see all young people succeed\nDo 9 to 5, not 5 to 10\nJust go to work and not the state pen\nCause you live better when you're out there free\nAnd that's comin straight to ya from the Young MC\n\n[Verse 10: Digital Underground]\nI'm in a rage\nOh yeah? Yo, why is that G?\nOther races, they say we act like rats in a cage\nI tried to argue, but check it, every night in the news\nWe prove them suckers right and I got the blues\nAmerica\nGet busy, Humpty\nThe red, the white, the blue and\nThe blue and the red\nFor Crips and Bloods\nThe white for who's got you doin\nTime bustin caps on one another\nThe Underground's down for peace among brothers\nKill a black man?\nWhat?\nYo, what are you retarded?\nTell em, Hump\nYo, do you work for the Klan?\nDo what ya like\nUnless you like gangbangin\nLet's see how many brothers leave us hangin\n\n[Verse 11: Oaktown's 3.5.7.]\nThe gang that should hang is the one that contains\nThe sisters and the brothers who are all in the same frame of mind\nNow listen, get loose, it's unity time\nYeah, yeah\nPeace is a presence that we all need\nThe future's in our hands, in word and deed\nI'm Terrible T and I'm Sweet LD\nWe're 3.5.7. totally\n\n[Verse 12: MC Hammer]\nKickin on the ave 'bout a quarter to 9\nAll the homies gettin blind in an eight ball line\nNow on this tip they started runnin at the lip\nJumped in their deuce and took a little trip\nHit the block about 12 on the tick\nThe windows went down and the nines went click\nPeople started yellin, bodies started bailin\nBullets cold flyin sendin some to hell and\nIt's gotta stop, we don't need all the violence\nPeace in the hood and a moment of silence\nWe got together not for ego or fame\nWe got involved cause we're all in the same gang\n\n[Verse 13: Eazy-E]\nLast but not least, yo, Eazy's no sell-out\nAnd if you can't hang in the streets, then get the hell out\nI'm not tryin to tell ya what to do\nYou have your own freedom of choice who to listen to\nYou knew good from bad, fair from foul, right from wrong\nNow your mother's singing that sad song\n(My baby ain't never hurt nobody!)\nBut he still got smoked at BeBe's party\nBut you're not the first or the last\nYou're nothin but a short story from the past\nYou're dead now, not number one but a zero\nTake notes from Eazy-E, the violent hero\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't you know we've got to put our heads together?\nDon't you know we've got to put our heads together?3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/399330", "artist_names": "M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce", "full_title": "Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)

much\nDo you think you can take\nUntil the heart in you\nIs starting to break?\nSometimes it feels like it will\n\n[Chorus]\nDarling, I don't know\nWhy I go to extremes\nToo high or too low\nThere ain't no in-betweens\nYou can be sure when I'm gone\nI won't be out there too long\nDarling, I don't know\nWhy I go to extremes\n\n[Verse 3]\nOut of the darkness, into the light\nLeaving the scene of the crime\nEither I'm wrong\nOr I'm perfectly right every time\nSometimes I lie awake, night after night\nComing apart at the seams\nEager to please, ready to fight\nWhy do I go to extremes?\nSee

mob\nPackages the candy cane\n\n[Chorus 1]\nHe's the one they call Dr. Feelgood\nHe's the one that makes ya feel all right\nHe's the one they call Dr. Feelgood\n[Verse 2]\nCops on the corner always ignore\nSomebody's getting paid\nJimmy's got it wired, law's for hire\nGot it made in the shade\nGot a little hideaway, does business all day\nBut at night he'll always be found\nSellin' sugar to the sweet\nPeople on the street\nCall this Jimmy's town\n\n[Chorus 1]\nHe's the one they call Dr. Feelgood\nHe's the one that makes ya feel all right\nHe's the one they call Dr. Feelgood\nHe's gonna be
