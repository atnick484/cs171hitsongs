right\nThere's nothing less than special when it comes to you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSee what we have is understanding\nThat works so well for how we are\nCause neither of us has the heart\nTo fall in love all over again\n[Chorus]\nEven though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl\nBut let's just act like it's that way tonight\nNow I know you got your friends and you know I got some too\nBut let's just act like you're my lady tonight\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow what I like about you\nIs that you're always so cool and comfortable whenever I'm around\nYou're someone that I can talk too\nNo matter what I'm going through I call on you\nCause I know you'll always be down\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSee what we have is so incredible\nThat we'll never find in anyone else\nThis thing that we share is so unbelievable\nThat I want you all to myself\n\n[Chorus]\nEven though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl\nBut let's just act like it's that way tonight\nNow I know you got your friends and you know I got some too\nBut let's just act like you're my lady tonight\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, I know that we both have our separate lives\nAnd we don't keep ties on each other\nSo you can have me\nSo that I can hold you until the morning comes\nThen we can go back to how things was before\nSee Musiq Soulchild LiveGet tickets as low as $199You might also like[Chorus]\nEven though I'm not your man and I

But you know, they didn't get here by themselves. It's been a long road and it's taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, they're like mystery stories, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they're on the fringes now. And they sound like they've been on the hard ground\n\nI should mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know I should mention John Hammond, great talent scout for Columbia Records. He signed me to that label when I was nobody. It took a lot of faith to do that, and he took a lot of ridicule, but he was his own man and he was courageous. And for that, I'm eternally grateful. The last person he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin, and before that Count Basie, Billie Holiday and a whole lot of other artists. All noncommercial artists\n\nTrends did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial but he stayed with me. He believed in my talent and that's all that mattered. I can't thank him enough for that\n\nLou Levy runs Leeds Music, and they published my earliest songs, but I didn't stay there too long. Levy himself, he went back a long ways. He signed me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them into a tape recorder. He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I was doing, that I was either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him a song like \"Stardust,\" he'd turn it down because it would be too late\n\nHe told me that if I was before my time -- and he didn't really know that for sure -- but if it was happening and if it was true, the public would usually take three to five years to catch up -- so be prepared. And that did happen. The trouble was, when the public did catch up I was already three to five years beyond that, so it kind of complicated it. But he was encouraging, and he didn't judge me, and I'll always remember him for that\n\nArtie Mogull at Witmark Music signed me next to his company, and he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what, that I might be on to something. Well, he too stood behind me, and he could never wait to see what I'd give him next. I didn't even think of myself as a songwriter before then. I'll always be grateful for him also for that attitude\nI also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded my songs very, very early, without having to be asked. Just something they felt about them that was right for them. I've got to say thank you to Peter, Paul and Mary, who I knew all separately before they ever became a group. I didn't even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldn't have happened to, or with, a better group\n\nThey took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the way I would have done it -- they straightened it out. But since then hundreds of people have recorded it and I don't think that would have happened if it wasn't for them. They definitely started something for me\n\nThe Byrds, the Turtles, Sonny & Cher -- they made some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasn't a pop songwriter and I really didn't want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their versions of songs were like commercials, but I didn't really mind that because 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials. So that was good too. I was glad it happened, and I was glad they'd done it\n\nPervis Staples and the Staple Singers -- long before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they were one of my favorite groups of all time. I met them all in '62 or '63. They heard my songs live and Pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the Staples Singers. They were the type of artists that I wanted recording my songs\n\nNina Simone. I used to cross paths with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub. These were the artists I looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she [inaudible] to me. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player and singer. Very strong woman, very outspoken. That she was recording my songs validated everything that I was about\n\nOh, and can't forget Jimi Hendrix. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames -- something like that. And Jimi didn't even sing. He was just the guitar player. He took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here\n\nJohnny Cash recorded some of my songs early on, too, up in about '63, when he was all skin and bones. He traveled long, he traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I heard many of his songs growing up. I knew them better than I knew my own. \"Big River,\" \"I Walk the Line.\"\n\n\"How high's the water, Mama?\" I wrote \"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\" with that song reverberating inside my head. I still ask, \"How high is the water, mama?\" Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that people were putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to magazines scolding people, telling them to shut up and let him sing\n\nIn Johnny Cash's world -- hardcore Southern drama -- that kind of thing didn't exist. Nobody told anybody what to sing or what not to sing. They just didn't do that kind of thing. I'm always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant of a man, the man in black. And I'll always cherish the friendship we had until the day there is no more days\n\nOh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Joan Baez. She was the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my songs and brought me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled with her beauty and voice\n\nPeople would say, \"What are you doing with that ragtag scrubby little waif?\" And she'd tell everybody in no uncertain terms, \"Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs.\" We even played a few of them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come. Love. And she's a free, independent spirit. Nobody can tell her what to do if she doesn't want to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman with devastating honesty. And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay that back\n\nLRelated Rare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nPOP & HISS\nRare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nSEE ALL RELATED\n8\nYou might also likeGRAMMYS 2015: Complete list | Show highlights | Quotes | Best & worst\n\nThe secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylan's new album\nThe secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylan's new album\nThese songs didn't come out of thin air. I didn't just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music, traditional rock 'n' roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music\n\nI learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them back when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me the code for everything that's fair game, that everything belongs to everyone\n\nFor three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one  song and sing it next in an hour if I'd heard it just once\n\n\nIf you sang \"John Henry\" as many times as me -- \"John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in his hand / John Henry said a man ain't nothin' but a man / Before I let that steam drill drive me down / I'll die with that hammer in my hand.\"\n\nIf you had sung that song as many times as I did, you'd have written \"How many roads must a man walk down?\" too\n\nBig Bill Broonzy had a song called \"Key to the Highway.\" \"I've got a key to the highway / I'm booked and I'm bound to go / Gonna leave here runnin' because walking is most too slow.\" I sang that a lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write\n\nGeorgia Sam he had a bloody nose\n\nWelfare Department they wouldn\u2019t give him no clothes\n\nHe asked poor Howard where can I go\n\nHoward said there\u2019s only one place I know\n\nSam said tell me quick man I got to run\nHoward just pointed with his gun\nAnd said that way down on Highway 61\n\nYou'd have written that too if you'd sang \"Key to the Highway\" as much as me\n\n\"Ain't no use sit 'n cry / You'll be an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail away.\" \"I'm sailing away my own true love.\" \"Boots of Spanish Leather\" -- Sheryl Crow just sung that\n\n\"Roll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton down / Ten dollars a day is a white man's pay / A dollar a day is the black man's pay / Roll the cotton down.\" If you sang that song as many times as me, you'd be writing \"I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,\" too\nI sang a lot of \"come all you\" songs. There's plenty of them. There's way too  many to be counted. \"Come along boys and listen to my tale / Tell you of my trouble on the old Chisholm Trail.\" Or, \"Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins a lad we all know well / The fate of Floyd Collins, a lad we all know well.\"\n\n\"Come all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning how you court your men / They're like a star on a summer morning / They first appear and then they're gone again.\" \"If you'll gather 'round, people / A story I will tell /  'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw / Oklahoma knew him well.\"\n\nIf you sung all these \"come all ye\" songs all the time, you'd be writing, \"Come gather 'round people where ever you roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that soon you'll be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving / And you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone / The times they are a-changing.\"\n\nYou'd have written them too. There's nothing secret about it. You just do it subliminally and unconsciously, because that's all enough, and that's all I sang. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds of songs that made sense\n\n\"When you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money in your socks / Women in Deep Ellum put you on the rocks.\" Sing that song for a while and you just might come up with, \"When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too / And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through / Don\u2019t put on any airs / When you\u2019re down on Rue Morgue Avenue / They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta you.\"\n\nAll these songs are connected. Don't be fooled. I just opened up a different door in a different kind of way. It's just different, saying the same thing. I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary\n\nWell you know, I just thought I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs were divisive for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got angered, others loved them. Didn't know why my songs had detractors and supporters. A strange environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway\n\nLast thing I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just writing them. I didn't think I was doing anything different. I thought I was just extending the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating on situations. Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard to pin down. You've just got to bear it. I didn't really care what Lieber and Stoller thought of my songs\n\nThey didn't like 'em, but Doc Pomus did. That was all right that they didn't like 'em, because I never liked their songs either. \"Yakety yak, don't talk back.\" \"Charlie Brown is a clown,\" \"Baby I'm a hog for you.\" Novelty songs. They weren't saying anything serious. Doc's songs, they were better. \"This Magic Moment.\" \"Lonely Avenue.\" Save the Last Dance for Me\n\nThose songs broke my heart. I figured I'd rather have his blessings any day than theirs\n\nAhmet Ertegun didn't think much of my songs, but Sam Phillips did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records: Ray Charles, Ray Brown, just to name a few\n\nThere were some great records in there, no question about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Radical eyes that shook the very essence of humanity. Revolution in style and scope. Heavy shape and color. Radical to the bone. Songs that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs that would never decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, I'd rather have Sam Phillips' blessing any day\n\nMerle Haggard didn't even think much of my songs. I know he didn't. He didn't say that to me, but I know [inaudible]. Buck Owens did, and he recorded some of my early songs. Merle Haggard -- \"Mama Tried,\" \"The Bottle Let Me Down,\" \"I'm a Lonesome Fugitive.\" I can't imagine Waylon Jennings singing \"The Bottle Let Me Down.\"\n\n\"Together Again\"? That's Buck Owens, and that trumps anything coming out of Bakersfield. Buck Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebody's blessing -- you figure it out\n\nOh, yeah. Critics have been giving me a hard time since Day One. Critics say I can't sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don't critics say that same thing about Tom Waits? Critics say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. What don't they say those things about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment? Critics say I can't carry a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? I've never heard that said about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free?\n\nYep. A more gracious way to lament or \"woe is me\" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...\n\nWhat have I done to deserve this special attention? No vocal range? When's the last time you heard Dr. John? Why don't you say that about him? Slur my words, got no diction. Have you people ever listened to Charley Patton or Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters. Talk about slurred words and no diction. [Inaudible] doesn't even matter\n\n\"Why me, Lord?\" I would say that to myself\n\nCritics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable. Oh, really? Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing Floyd Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national anthem, somebody sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving\n\nAfter that it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing sister was chosen to sing. She sang every note -- that exists, and some that don't exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a one-syllable word and make it last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was on a trapeze act. But to me it was not funny\n\nWhere were the critics? Mangling lyrics? Mangling a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I don't really think I do that. I just think critics say I do\n\nSam Cooke said this when told he had a beautiful voice: He said, \"Well that's very kind of you, but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth.\" Think about that the next time you [inaudible]\n\nTimes always change. They really do. And you have to always be ready for something that's coming along and you never expected it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read this article, a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some kind of new song, and he couldn't understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming in were about\n\nNow Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called \"Country Road.\" Tom was going off in this  interview -- \"But James don't say nothing about a country road. He's just says how you can feel it on the country road. I don't understand that.\"\n\nNow some might say Tom is a great songwriter. I'm not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview I was actually listening to a song of his on the radio\n\nIt was called \"I Love.\" I was listening to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about all the things he loves, an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people. Trying to make you think that he's just like you and you're just like him. We all love the same things, and we're all in this together. Tom loves little baby ducks, slow-moving trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country streams. Sleeping without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes on the vine, and onions\nNow listen, I'm not ever going to disparage another songwriter. I'm not going to do that. I'm not saying it's a bad song. I'm just saying it might be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10 anyway. Tom and a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in a box. If you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them, and Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing their thing\n\nThis was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved to Texas. About the same time. He's still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic. Everything was all right until -- until -- Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they ain't seen anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat, flew his helicopter into Johnny Cash's backyard like a typical songwriter. And he went for the throat. \"Sunday Morning Coming Down.\"\n\nWell, I woke up Sunday morning\n\nGrammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King\nGrammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King\nWith no way to hold my head that didn't hurt\n\nAnd the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad\n\nSo I had one more for dessert\n\nThen I fumbled through my closet\n\nFound my cleanest dirty shirt\n\nThen I washed my face and combed my hair\n\nAnd stumbled down the stairs to meet the day\n\nYou can look at Nashville pre-Kris and post-Kris, because he changed everything. That one song ruined Tom T. Hall's poker parties. It might have sent him to the crazy house. God forbid he ever heard any of my songs\n\nYou walk into the room\n\nWith your pencil in your hand\n\nYou see somebody naked\n\nYou say, \u201cWho is that man?\u201d\n\nYou try so hard\n\nBut you don\u2019t understand\n\nJust what you're gonna say\n\nWhen you get home\n\nYou know something is happening here\n\nBut you don\u2019t know what it is\n\nLRelated Rare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nPOP & HISS\nRare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nSEE ALL RELATED\n8\n\nDo you, Mister Jones?\n\nIf \"Sunday Morning Coming Down\" rattled Tom's cage, sent him into the looney bin, my song surely would have made him blow his brains out, right there in the minivan. Hopefully he didn't hear it\n\nI just released an album of standards, all the songs usually done by Michael Buble, Harry Connick Jr., maybe Brian Wilson's done a couple, Linda Ronstadt done 'em. But the reviews of their records are different than the reviews of my record\n\nIn their reviews no one says anything. In my reviews, [inaudible] they've got to look under every stone when it comes to me. They've got to mention all the songwriters' names. Well that's OK with me. After all, they're great songwriters and these are standards. I've seen the reviews come in, and they'll mention all the songwriters in half the review, as if everybody knows them. Nobody's heard of them, not in this time, anyway. Buddy Kaye, Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh, to name a few\n\nCComments\n@studiocity2 Yep. A more gracious way to lament or \"woe is me\" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...\nRICHARDOVICH\nAT 1:43 PM FEBRUARY 09, 2015\nADD A COMMENTSEE ALL COMMENTS\n45\n\nBut, you know, I'm glad they mention their names, and you know what? I'm glad they got their names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but they're finally there. I can only wonder why it took so long. My only regret is that they're not here to see it\n\nTraditional rock 'n' roll, we're talking about that. It's all about rhythm. Johnny Cash said it best: \"Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you get the blues.\" Very few rock 'n' roll bands today play with rhythm. They don't know what it is. Rock 'n' roll is a combination of blues, and it's a strange thing made up of two parts. A lot of people don't know this, but the blues, which is an American music, is not what you think it is. It's a combination of Arabic violins and Strauss waltzes working it out. But it's true\n\n\nThe other half of rock 'n' roll has got to be hillbilly. And that's a derogatory term, but it ought not to be. That's a term that includes the Delmore Bros., Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Clarence Ashley ... groups like that. Moonshiners gone berserk. Fast cars on dirt roads. That's the kind of combination that makes up rock 'n' roll, and it can't be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio\n\nYou have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you can't hardly play the blues, how do you [inaudible] those other two kinds of music in there? You can fake it, but you can't really do it\n\nCritics have made a career out of accusing me of having a career of confounding expectations. Really? Because that's all I do. That's how I think about it. Confounding expectations\n\n\"What do you do for a living, man?\"\n\n\"Oh, I confound expectations.\"\n\nYou're going to get a job, the man says, \"What do you do?\" \"Oh, confound expectations.: And the man says, \"Well, we already have that spot filled. Call us back. Or don't call us, we'll call you.\" Confounding expectations. What does that mean? 'Why me, Lord? I'd confound them, but I don't know how to do it.'\n\nThe Blackwood Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together. That might confound expectations, but it shouldn't. Of course it would be a gospel album. I don't think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me. Not a bit. One of the songs I'm thinking about singing is \"Stand By Me\" by the Blackwood Brothers. Not \"Stand By Me\" the pop song. No. The real \"Stand By Me.\"\n\nThe real one goes like this:\n\nWhen the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing me / Like a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me\n\nIn the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou who never lost a battle / Stand by me\n\nIn the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best I can / And my friends don't understand / Thou who knowest all about  me / Stand by me\n\nThat's the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one by that name, that's going to be the one. I'm also thinking of recording a song, not on that album, though: \"Oh Lord, Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.\"\n\nAnyway, why me, Lord. What did I do?\n\nAnyway, I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I'm honored to have all these artists singing my songs. There's nothing like that. Great artists. [applause, inaudible]. They're all singing the truth, and you can hear it in their voices\n\nI'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization. They've helped many people. Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture. I'd like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldn't work. Billy was a son of rock 'n' roll, obviously\n\n\nHe was a true original. He did it all: He played, he sang, he wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along. You just don't stand a chance\n\nSo Billy became what is known in the industry -- a condescending term, by the way -- as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while, a one-hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star who's got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billy's hit song was called \"Red Hot,\" and it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy about it. Change your life\n\nHe did it with style and grace. You won't find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He's not there. Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas -- I know they're in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan -- I've got nothing against them. Soft rock, hard rock, psychedelic pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff, but after all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet\n\nI'd see him a couple times a year and we'd always spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and we'd cross paths now and again. We'd always spend time together. He was a hero of mine. I'd heard \"Red Hot.\" I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and it's impressed me to this day\n\nYep. A more gracious way to lament or \"woe is me\" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...\n\nI never grow tired of listening to it. Never got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasn't bitter or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was content with who he was\n\nAnd then one day he got sick. And like my friend John Mellencamp would sing -- because John sang some truth today -- one day you get sick and you don't get better. That's from a song of his called \"Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days.\" It's one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I ain't lying\n\nAnd I ain't lying when I tell you that MusiCares paid for my friend's doctor bills, and helped him to get spending money. They were able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the end. That is something that can't be repaid. Any organization that would do that would have to have my blessing\n\nI'm going to get out of here now. I'm going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people and said too much about some. But that's OK. Like the spiritual song, 'I'm still just crossing over Jordan too.' Let's hope we meet again. Sometime. And we will, if, like Hank Williams said, \"the good Lord willing and the creek don't rise.\"1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/32748", "artist_names": "Hi-Tek (Ft.

Hi-Tek]\nRemix, Jonell, Def Jam, Method Man, How High\n\n[Verse 1: Jonell]\nAll the game that you were spittin', You know that you was trippin'\nNever thought to see me dippin' but I had to get

wish I shut up\n\n[Chorus: Jonell]\nI really don't know what you came here for\nRound and around we go!\nSending your bags outside the door\nRound and around we go!\nI really don't know what you came

no (Yo, yo)\n\n[Verse 1: M\u00fda]\nHe has a little game that he plays\nClever little ways and a hot boy style\nBrags about the dough that he makes\nFlash a little cash most girls wild out (Oh

let you get the best of me\n(You put it on me)\nThe best of me\n(You put it on me)\n\n[Verse 2: M\u00fda]\nSo is he trying to play with my head?\nTellin' me how he could blow my mind\nSomethin' 'bout the things that he said\nMade me want to take it there one time\nI should be walking away\nCause his hand's up on my thigh\nShould I leave, should I stay?\nAfter all it's just one night\nYou might

I'mma pay both y'all rent\nSo forget about the condo and come to the crib\nCause the castle over the mountain come with a bridge\nYou know, literally, we could go shopping in Italy\nHand on her thigh

need to do is turn this car around\nDrive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown\nAnd run to her, take her in my arms\nMake her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard\nBut I drive on, and on, and on\n[Verse 2]\nEighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue\nThere's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do\nOr maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee\nI know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep\nNow the sun's going down on my broken heart\nLord, I got to get back before I get too far\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat I need to do is turn this car around\nDrive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown\nAnd run to her, take her in my arms\nMake her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard\nBut I drive on\nYes I

sunshine has come and I'm all cried out\nAnd there's no more rain in this cloud\n(There's no more rain)\nMy sunshine has come (no more rain in this cloud)\n(Let it go) And I'm all cried out\nAnd there's no more rain in this cloud (no more rain)\n[Verse 1]\nThere's no hiding place\nWhen someone has hurt you\nIt's written on your face and it reads\n\"Broken spirit, lost and confused\nEmpty, scared, used and abused, a fool, oh\"\nAin't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?\n(It's written all over your face, yeah)\nAnd the smile you used to wear\nSeems a little bit out of place (tracks of your tears)\nPeople, oh, hold on, in time\nIt gets a little better, oh yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nMy sunshine has come (no more rain in this cloud)\n(My sunshine) And I'm all cried out\nAnd there's no more rain in this cloud\n(There's no more rain, no, no)\nMy sunshine has come and I'm all cried out\nAnd there's no more rain in this cloud\n(No more rain, no more rain)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo you want to live and to you I shall give\nAll the space that you requested\nHope you don't live to regret it\nSo you say you're in your prime\nBaby, don't waste your time (no more rain)\nRemember my love (no more rain)\nIt's only a thin line (too little, too never, too late)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nMy sunshine has come (no more rain)\n(My sunshine) And I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)\nAnd there's no more rain in this cloud (no more rain)\n(There's no more rain)\nMy sunshine has come (no more rain)\n(My sunshine, no more rain)\nAnd I'm all cried out\nAnd there's no more rain in this cloud\n(No more rain in this cloud, no more rain)\n\n[Bridge]\nSpring has come and winter's gone, my love\n(No more rain, winter's gone)\nBut don't look around for me, child\nI'll be gone, gone, gone, gone\n(I'll be gone, gone, gone)\n(No more rain) Not afraid (not afraid)\nBecause the seasons have changed\nI'm gonna count my blessings (no more rain)\nAnd just follow the sun 'cause you see\n\n[Chorus]\nMy sunshine has come\n(Now, I wanna take a minute to kick it like this)\n(Has come, y'all wit' me?)\nAnd I'm all cried out\n(Y'all know what I'm talkin' about?)\nAnd there's no more rain in this cloud\n(You know what to do, no more rain in this cloud)\nMy sunshine has come (no more rain, no more rain)\n(There's no hiding place)\nAnd I'm all cried out (when you're hurting)\nAnd there's no more rain in this cloud\n(No more rain in this cloud, no, no, no)\nBaby, don't want tear drops\nDrying upon my pillow\n(I used to think the world of you)\nOnly room for raindrops (no more rain)\nDon't belong on my smile (baby, there's)\nAnd there's no more rain in this cloud\n(Nothing I would not do)\nBaby, don't want tear drops\nDrying upon my pillow (You broke me down)\nOnly room for raindrops\nDon't belong on my smile (You broke me down)\n(No more rain) And there's no more rain in this cloud\n(You, you, you, baby, broke me down)\nMy sunshine has come (Goes around, comes around)\n(What goes up) And I'm all cried out (Must come down)\n(Things you do) And there's no more rain in this cloud\n(Come back to you, y'all believe that?) (I said)\nMy sunshine has come (Goes around, comes around)\n(What goes up) And I'm all cried out (Must come down)\n(Things you do) And there's no more rain in this cloud\n(Come back to you)Embed"},

of a clown with teardrops\nStreamin' down his face?\n[Chorus]\nPop a top, again\nI think I'll have another round\nSet em' up my friend\nThen I'll be gone\nAnd you can let\nSome other fool sit down\n\n[Verse 2]\nHome for me, is misery\nAnd here I'm wastin' time\nCause a row of fools on a row of stools\nIs not what's on my mind\nBut then you see her leaving me\nIt's not what I prefer\nSo, it's either here just drinkin' beer\nOr home remembering her\n\n[Chorus]\nPop a top, again\nI think I'll have another round\nSet em' up my friend\nThen I'll be gone\nAnd you can let\nSome other fool

existed\nOr renovated and called historic districts\nThere goes the little man\nThere goes the little man\n[Chorus]\nNow the court square's just a set of streets\nThat the people go round but they seldom think\nAbout the little man that built this town\nBefore the big money shut them down\nAnd killed the little man\nOh, the little man\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass\nAnd one cold rainy night he fixed your flat\nThe new stores came where you do it yourself\nYou buy a lotto ticket and food off the shelf\nForget the little man\nForget about that little man\n\n[Verse 3]\nHe hung on there for a few more years\nBut he couldn't sell Slurpees\nAnd he wouldn't sell beer\nNow the bank rents the station\nTo a man down the road\nAnd they sell Velvet Elvis and\nSecond-hand clothes\nThere goes little man\nThere goes another little man\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nNow the court square's just a set of streets\nThat the people go round but they seldom

can buy the whole world in just one trip\nAnd save a penny because it's jumbo size\nThey don't even realize\nThey're killing the little man\nOh the little man\n\n[Chorus]\nNow the court square's just a set of streets\nThat the people go round but they seldom think\nAbout the little man that built this town\nBefore the big money shut them down\nAnd killed the little man\nOh the little man\n\n[Verse 4]\nIt wasn't long ago when I was a child\nAn old black man came with his mule and his plow\nHe broke the ground where we grew our garden\nBack before we'd all forgotten\nAbout the little man\nThe

before we knew we could\n\n[Chorus]\nOh yes\nThere can be miracles\nWhen you believe\nThough hope is frail\nIt's hard to kill\nWho knows what miracles\nYou can achieve\nWhen you believe\nSomehow you will\nYou will when you believe\n[Verse 2]\nIn this time of fear\nWhen prayer so often proves in vain\nHope seemed like the summer birds\nToo swiftly flown away\nYet now I'm standing here\nMy heart's so full, I can't explain\nSeeking faith and speaking words\nI never thought I'd say\n\n[Chorus]\nThere can be miracles\nWhen you believe\nWhen you believe\nThough hope is frail\nIt's hard to kill\nMmm, who knows what miracles\nYou can achieve\nYou can achieve\nWhen you believe\nSomehow you will\nYou will when you believe\n\n[Bridge]\nThey don't always happen when you ask\nAnd it's easy to give in to your fears\nBut when you're blinded by your pain\nCan't see your way clear through the rain\nA small, but still, resilient voice\nSays help is very near\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThere can be miracles\n(Miracles!)\nWhen you believe\n(Oh, when you believe)\nThough hope is frail\nIt's hard to kill\n(Hard to kill, oh yeah)\nWho knows what miracles\nYou can achieve\n(You can achieve)\nWhen you believe\nSomehow you will\n(Somehow, somehow, somehow)\nNow you will\nYou will when you believe\n\n[Outro]\nYou will when you believe\nYou will when you believe\nJust believe (You will, you will)\nJust believe\nYou will when you believe3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 7, "api_path": "/songs/85560", "artist_names": "Everclear", "full_title": "Father of Mine

favorite group ain't comin' wit' it\nBut I'm witcha 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway\nBut anyhow, when in doubt\nWent on out and bought it 'cause I thought it would be jammin'\nBut examine all the flawsky-wawsky, awfully\nSad and it's costly, but that's all she\nWrote, and I hope I never have to float in that boat\nUp shit's creek, \"It's weak\" is the last quote\nThat I wanna hear when I'm goin' down\nWhen all's said and done and we got a new joe in town\nWhen the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down\nAll y'all can say is, \"Them niggas earned the crown,\" but until then\nYou might also like[Chorus: Big Boi]\nAh ha, hush that fuss\nEverybody move to the back of the bus\nDo you wanna bump and slump with us?\nWe the type of people make the club get crunk\nSay ah

butterfly kisses, after bedtime prayer\nSticking little white flowers all up in her hair\nYou know how much I love you Daddy, but if you don't mind\nI'm only going to kiss you on the cheek this time\nOh with all that I've done wrong I must've done something right\nTo deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, like the wind, the years go by\nSpread your wings and fly\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe'll change her name today\nOh and she'll make a promise and I'll give her away\nStanding in the bride-room just starin' at her\nShe asked me what I'm thinkin' and I said I'm not sure\nI just feel like I'm losin' my baby girl\nAnd she leaned over\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd gave me butterfly kisses with her momma there\nSticking little white flowers all up in her hair\nWalk me down the aisle Daddy, it's just about time\nDoes my wedding gown look pretty Daddy? Daddy don't cry\nOh with all that I've done wrong I must've done something right\nTo deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night\n\n[Tag]\nThis is what love is\nOh her love every morning and butterfly kisses at nightEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1001707", "artist_names": "Joose", "full_title": "If Tomorrow Never Comes by\u00a0Joose", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669667631", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669667631", "id": 1001707, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429582709, "path": "/Joose-if-tomorrow-never-comes-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Joose-if-tomorrow-never-comes-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669667631", "song_art_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669667631", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "If Tomorrow Never Comes", "title_with_featured": "If Tomorrow Never Comes", "updated_by_human_at": 1434556610, "url": "https://genius.com/Joose-if-tomorrow-never-comes-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/368482", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669667631", "id": 368482, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669667631", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Joose", "slug": "Joose", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Joose"}, "artist": "Joose", "lyrics": "If Tomorrow Never Comes LyricsVERSE 1:\nSometimes late at night\nI lie awake and watch her sleeping\nShe's lost in peaceful dreams\nSo I turned out the light\nAs I lay there in the dark\nAnd a thought crosses my mind\nIf I never wake in the morning\nWill she ever doubt\nThe way I feel about her, in my heart\nCHORUS:\nIf tomorrow never comes\nWill she know how much I loved her\nDid I try in every way\nTo show her every day\nShe's my only one\nIf my time on earth were through\nShe must face this world without me\nSo the love I gave her in the past\nWould it be enough to last\nIf tomorrow never comes\n\nVERSE 2:\nCause I've lost loved ones in my life\nWho never knew how much I loved them\nNow I live with the regret, that my true feelings for them\nNever were revealed\nSo I made a promise to myself\nTo say each day how much she means to me\nAnd avoid that circumstance\nWhere's no second chance\nTo tell her how I feel\n\nCHORUS:\nIf tomorrow never comes\nWill she know how much I loved her,(how much I loved her)\nDid I try in every way\nTo show her every day\nShes my only one\nIf my time on earth were through\nShe must face this world without me\nSo the love I gave her in the past\nWould it be enough to last\nIf tomorrow never comes\nSo tell it to someone that you love\nJust what you're thinking of\nIf tomorrow never comesYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/3868848", "artist_names": "URLtv (Ft.

(Rematch) Lyrics[Round 1: NWX]\n[D] Previously on NWX versus Gun Titles\n[K] Y'all remember I was about to fuck these niggas up cause y'all was talkin' mad shit\n[D] Well all I remember is button shirt, bag zipped and Surf puttin' Roc(k) on yo' ass like the Fast 6\n[K] Nigga when?\n[D] When that nigga called Paul Walker from Heaven and made him crash whips\n[K] Nah see, you got it fucked up, see I remember a nigga sayin' \"suck my dick\" and I almost made him backflip\n[D] Well I remember before the shot and after the shot\n[K] I wasn't worried 'bout that shit\n[D] Well you should've been\n[K] Why?\n[D] Cause that's the part in the battle when we was gettin' our ass whipped\n[K] Well this time I'm back sucka, with a big mil' (meal)\n[D] This the last supper\n[K] I ain't even wipe the tray (trey) off I'ma bad butler\n[D] Newspaper, shells everywhere\n[K] I'm a Crab lover, you want the knife or the first round?\n[D] Pick, that's a draft number\n[K] Tie him to the front of the car\n[D] And let him drag under\n[K] Two letters, I'll let a hundred meter (meet a) mark\n[D] Like a track runner\n[K] Leg shot\n[D] Lebron James\n[K] I've got his Calves covered\nTwo niggas shootin' Roc(k) without lookin'\n[D] We the Splash Brothers\nI caught him on a Dark (K)night\n[K] I pulled up with a Bane mask\n[D] Time of death\n[K] 9:11\n[D] That's a plane crash\nSame casket, same morgue\n[K] They toes get the same tag\n[D] Well if you feelin' the shot then put a mil' (Amil) on The Roc\n[K] Dame Dash\n[D] Two buck fifties\n[K] Come and get yo' stage pass\nI bet he couldn't stop these autos with break pads\n[D] If he escape fast then let the .8 blast\n[K] I got somethin' big stashed; Drake's dad\n[D] Last battle, that shit was all gas\n[K] This battle is shoppin' sprees; I bring 'em all (mall) bags\n[D] In the battle\n[K] Suck my dick\n[D] After the battle\n[K] Toy's flash\n[D] Before the shot?\n[K] Irving Plaza\n[D] After the shot?\n[Both] Troy Ave!\n[D] The .40 get to bustin', I get his whole team shot\n[K] Nina lickin' next, she tryin' to get a G spot\n[D] I'm shootin' Roc right over this square\n[K] Tree top\n[D] All my pieces hittin'\n[K] I even got a green dot\n[D] Muah, to make him kiss the pound, welcome to D-Block\n[K] Nah, to give his [?] kicks, welcome to Reebok\nThey'll 'Reminisce Over You'; Pete Rock\n[D] Bodies off the wall, they'll cover Surf with the sheet Roc(k)\n[K] Strap on the back like new Airs\n[D] Bomb stuck\n[K] Two arms up, who cares?\n[D] Milhouse, I'm leavin' lens on\n[K] Everything blue here (hair)\n[D] Nah I'm leavin' shirts red and bottoms gone, I'm thinkin' Pooh bear\n[K] What if they got two Glocks, two pairs and Tsu there?\n[D] Then I'm gettin' him, Daylyt, Rex and Mook aired\n[K] The look on the crime scene when the cops swing through there\n[D] That shit was the Domino's logo, it was just three Dot's and two squares\n[K] Hold up tho, I mean since you here, why the fuck they think you panic a lot?\n[D] Cause I control my temper and don't fuck up the only chance that I got\nYou on the other hand wanna fight in every battle\n[K] Bro I don't give a damn 'bout this spot\nIt's Space Jam, I got my talent back soon as I got my hands on the Roc(k)\nWhat we got? Another former Zip 'Em Up/Cave Gang/Dot wit' a death wish\n[D] Then he turned Gun Titles\n[K] Stupid nigga set trip\n.40 in the left hand\n[D] Forgot the \"is he dead\" kick\n[K] I'm waitin' for the lead out, trip him by the exit\nGrab him while he fallin', grip him by his necklace\nSon tryin' to Slide, it's finna get Electric\nShootin' whole subs, forget about the breadsticks\nStomach shot, they can't tell his dinner from his breakfast\n[D] You got that Puerto Rican chopper?\n[K] No I got this from Cali\n[D] To tape a Raptor nigga up\n[K] Leave that option to Lowry\n[D] Gauge liftin', Tay missin'\n[K] Put his top where the clowns be\n[D] That's Chris Paul to Blake Griffin\n[K] Toss Roc(k) in the alley\n[D] Let's get the fun started\n[K] Hammers you want, here's one cartridge\n[D] Arms up, get the Roc in (rockin') the head\n[K] I'm unbothered, lead the league in punk, Roc(k) and roll\n[D] We punk artists\n[K] How the fuck y'all Gun Titles\n[D] And you can't hold gun charges?\nThis is round one, it's gettin' hot in here, what's your slogan?\n[K] Zip 'em up\n[D] What's mine?\n[Crowd] Get 'em the fuck outta here!\n[D] Hell no, get this nigga that sucks the fuck outta here\nGet this stupid nigga Roc sayin' he wasn't Zip 'Em Up the fuck outta here\n[K] Get you bein' gay wit' your hand on your hip the fuck outta here\n[D] Get sayin' you gon' knock Shine the fuck out, 60 feet

square\nHeaded for Delaware with one change of gear\nNothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed\nWith the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave\nDollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts\nJakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print\nThough I'm innocent 'til proven guilty\nI'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty\nFor real, G, I'ma fulfill my dream\nIf I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream\nThe first trip without the clique\nSent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it\nFresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes\nI want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes\nGod's sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half a million\nWithout the FBI catching feelings?\n\n[Chorus]\nStreet dreams are made of

push a thousand feet back\nHolding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back\nLiving with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet\nTwo sips from being alcoholic\nNine-hundred-ninety-nine thou' from being rich\nBut now, I'm all for it\nMy man saw it like Dionne Warwick\nA wiser team for a wiser dream we could all score with\nThe cartel, Argentina coke with the nina\nUp in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina\nTrina got the fishscale between her\nThe way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her\nShe got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar\nGuess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins\nBitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM'\nWord is bond, son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this\n\n[Chorus]\nStreet dreams are made

ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans\nG'ing, heard about them old timers OD'ing\nYoung, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady\nWorshiping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me\nThe street raised me up giving a fuck\nI thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up\nI knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody\nCut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink noddy\nAin't that funny? Getting put on to crack money\nWith all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry\nA case of beers in the staircase, I wasted years\nSome niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career\nBut I'm a rebel, stressing to pull out of the heat, no doubt\nWith Jeeps tinted out, spending, never holding out\n\n[Chorus]\nStreet dreams are made of these\nNiggas push Bimmers and 300 E's\nA drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key\nEverybody's looking for something\nStreet dreams are made of these\nShorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese\nWho am I to disagree?\nEverybody's looking for something\nStreet dreams are made of these\nNiggas push Bimmers and 300 E's\nA drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key\nEverybody's looking for something\nStreet dreams are made of these\nShorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese\nWho am I to disagree?\nEverybody's looking for something\n\n[Skit]\n*Gunshot*\n\"Yeah nigga, what?!\"\n\"Oh, shit!\"\n\"Queensbridge, boy, what?!

song\nI got this beat runnin' 'round in my head, 'round in my head\n\n[Verse 1: Dutch Masta]\nMusic is my life take it from me is like taking my soul\nI knew every word to Bohemian Rhapsody at 2 years old\nAnd I'll be singing it until mama mia let me go\nGoing ill sick nasty, gonorrhea on the flow\nGot that fever burning slow steady rep Brooklyn\nLooking fresher than brand new crazy like an unmanned zoo\nUnderstan who I am (Dutch Masta) so\nSay it three times with the lights out and it might sound like\nWhat a fight sound like keep the lights off regretting what the sight might be\nIt is me smiling teeth whitening\nMy rhymes might not be good for your health and if you ain't feeling me well\nI probably ain't feeling you neither so press your ears against the speakers\nAnd blow your brains out oxy clean the stains out\nMusic is my weapon of choice but I'm not 5'9 like Royce\nI still stand tall keep my held high look above it all\nAll the bullshit and the lies keep a temper mental state of mind\nSo throw your CDs in the crapper surpised that this cracker flow\nIs better than your favorite rappers\n[Hook]\nHistory inevitable when I step in the vocal booth\nMy bars on beast mode you can call me Beowulf\nMy brain so inkredible but don't call me Trae the Truth\nLook through the peep hole see you begging on my stoop\nPlease please put me on please please take me back\nI know I did you wrong let's put it in the past\nGirl don't make me act a ass because you acting like a fool\nTake out your pen and paper because I'm taking you to school\nDon't steal nobody's lyrics once I found that out knew you was a gimmick\nJumping Jimminy Cricket that ain't the business\nYour bars they are so terrible mine heal and soothe like theraflu\nI am so ahead of you I wrote this in 3002\nLurking like Plies and Flocka rolling out with all my dudes\nMME Crankupondabeat turn up we making moves\nEating good and drinking bubbly\nCase of that Dom P man that's nothing\nCoupe with the fly feet now that stuntin\nSwerve to the fly beat Mercy bumpin ah\n\n[Hook]You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1228559", "artist_names": "Shades

an important part of your romantic night together. While it can be used in many ways, like in your car as you drive to dinner or a concert, it works best as a mood-setter for a quiet night at home together. The playlist is the background to your own expression of romance, but it serves as a subliminal message of your love and affection.\n\nAssembled here are two playlists, and two points of view \u2013 one, a man, the other, a woman. Your playlist will be your own feelings and expression, but these can serve as inspiration and maybe remind you of the special songs you want on your own.A Man\u2019s ViewGuys love sex almost as much as food. (Some claim they love sex even more than food, but really, they just love the thrill of the hunt for sex, and after the sex, they\u2019ll go have some food to celebrate.) Guys also know that women secretly love bad boys, so your playlist has to convey that undertone early and often to impart a sense of danger. You just can\u2019t do that with classical music; save that for Sunday morning. No, the best music to express that bad boy image is rock. You can go with any of its variants, from country rock to southern rock to rockabilly to punk to indie, but keeping an edge to it will serve you well.\n\nThe playlist must have four parts too:Flirtation \u2013 Sets the mood for romanceSeduction \u2013 Lets her know she\u2019s the only one you desireSurrender \u2013 Helps her release her inhibitions and beg you for the coup de gr\u00e2ceTe Amo Mi Amor\u2013 Time to express your love and fidelity\nA Man\u2019s Playlist:\nPart 1: Flirtation:\n\"Water of Love\" -- by Dire Straits -- Why It's Here\n\"Footsteps (Go Higher)\" -- by Pop Evil -- Why It's Here\n\"I'm Gonna Do My Thing\" -- by Royal Deluxe -- Why It's Here\n\"Crazy Mama\" -- by JJ Cale -- Why It's Here\n\"Red Staggerwing\" -- by Mark Knopfler and\nEmmylou Harris -- Why It's Here\n\"You Got the Silver\" -- by The Rolling Stones -- Why It's Here\n\"Squeezebox\" -- by The Who -- Why It's Here\n\"Junkie Doll\" -- by Mark Knopfler -- Why It's Here\n\"Unknown Legend\" -- by Neil Young -- Why It's Here\n\"Money Can't Buy It\" -- by Annie Lennox -- Why It's Here\n\"Fever\" - by Link Wray - Why It's Here\n\"Hot Legs\" -- by Rod Stewart -- Why It's Here\n\"Romeo and Juliet\" --\nby Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris -- Why It's Here\n\"Breathe\" by Ubiquitous pf Ces Cru--\n\"Double OT\" by Ces Cru--\n\"Daydream\" by Ces Cru ft.

However, this doesn't mean that women don't crave intimacy with their companions (while it lasts). A woman loves to play innocent and seduce her man through subtle implications that escalate to full-blown love. She is determined to leave a legacy in her companion's mind, and most of all, make him feel. She voices her feelings of devotion, and most of all, her wish for her Valentine to reciprocate these feelings.A Woman's Playlist:There is no better way to beckon him than through a dance floor, be it through upbeat pop or classic jazz. Yes, even if you need to learn a mating dance like a certain species of sexy bird to get his attention, put some swing into it for V-Day. There are a number of moods you could use to get him on the stage to get the love felt:Upbeat /energetic: If he is the straight-forward type, he is likely more responsive towards a blaring and blunt track that screams \"LOVE ME AND TOUCH ME!\" or \"I LOVE YOU SO IT'S YOUR TURN TO RECIPROCATE!\"Intimate confessing: These songs are far more mellow and often contain subtle implications of what the artist really wants. The declaration of love and the invitation for it are expressed nonetheless.\n\nUpbeat/energetic:\n\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" --\nby Whitney Houston -- Why it's Here\n\"Closer\" -- by Tegan and Sara -- Why It's Here\n\"We Found Love\" -- by Rihanna -- Why It's Here\n\"Counterfeit\" -- by Meghan Linsey -- Why It's Here\n\"The Wire\" -- by HAIM -- Why It's Here\n\"XO\" -- by Beyonc\u00e9 -- Why It's Here\n\"Honey Bee\" -- by Lucinda Williams -- Why It's Here\n\"Snatch and Grab It\" -- by Julia Lee -- Why It's Here\n\"I Need a Man\" -- by Eurythmics -- Why it's Here\n\"Hite Report Disco\" -- by National Lampoon -- Why It's Here\n\"Desire\" -- by U2 -- Why It's Here\n\"You and I\" -- by Lady Gaga -- Why It's Here\n\"Like a Prayer\" -- by Madonna -- Why It's Here\n\"Volcano Girls\" -- by Veruca Salt -- Why It's Here\nFor intimate confessing:\n\"Love Story\" -- by Taylor Swift -- Why It's Here\n\"Moondance\" -- by Van Morrison -- Why It's Here\n\"Wildest Dreams\" -- by Taylor Swift -- Why It's Here\n\"In Spite of Ourselves\" --\nby John Prine & Iris Dement -- Why It's Here\n\"Read My Mind\" -- by The Killers -- Why It's Here\n\"Beautiful\" -- by Mariah Carey -- Why It's Here\n\"Mandolin Wind\" -- by Rod Stewart -- Why It's Here\n\"Make You Feel My Love\" --\nby Adele/Bob Dylan -- Why It's Here\n\"On The Sunny Side of the Street\" --\nby Dizzy Gillespie -- Why It's Here\n\"Feels Like Home\" - by Bonnie Raitt -- Why It's Here\n\"Love Me Like a Man\" -- by Bonnie Raitt -- Why It's Here\n\"You and I\" -- by Lady Gaga -- Why It's Here\n\"There Will Never Be Another You\" --\nby Lester Young -- Why It's Here\n\"I Touch Myself\" -- by Divinyls -- Why It's Here\n\"Stay On\" -- by The BoDeans -- Why It's Here\n\"Share Your Love\" -- by Susan Tedeschi -- Why It's Here\n\"Fever\" -- by Peggy Lee -- Why It's Here\n\"For What it's Worth\" -- by Stevie Nicks -- Why It's Here\n\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" --\nby Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong -- Why It's Here\nPoint / Counterpoint\nPoint:\n\"She is determined to leave a legacy in her companion's mind\"\n- Angela Ding\nLegacy schmegacy, Angela. Men know that women want commitment and security. (They have an instinctual need to nest.) Women won't have sex with men at the drop of a hat; they need to know there's a real connection and real emotion. I'll bet it was women that invented Valentine's Day idea to begin with. You ladies created a whole ritual around love itself, and then insist that we guys express our feelings. It isn't bad enough that we have to show our feelings (and thus become vulnerable to your rejection), you have to layer onto the whole thing that there be a legacy to our relationship - that we have to carry our devotion to you around with us in a sling bag, long after you're gone, to share with the next woman who comes down the pike.\n\nCounterpoint:\n\"Hi, I'm George, and I like you, but I like sex so much more, so let me seduce you with bad-boy music.\" If you think that's the way to a woman's heart, then bravo. Hardcore music doesn't go very far if you also want it to have those \"Te Amo Mi Amor\" undertones. Nice attempt at painting a bad-boy image with romantic setting, but charming women through a four-step guide of confessions just to snatch us for a bodily release is just superficial.\n\nIf you want a one-night stand, then of course women need to mean something to the male, and being a part of him is a greater proof of devotion. What you view as \"baggage\" is a memory of what used to be. Or, in the male's standards, as long as the sex was great, right?About the Authors:\n\nAngela Ding and George Plant are regular contributors here at Genius.  As you could tell from their position statements and annotations , they role-played  stereotypical characters for this article.  Their relationship is collegial; they have no personal or romantic (or even adversarial) relationship.\n\nThe underlying message here was that, in a relationship, we each have many sides to our personalities.  While men are often painted one way and women another, it's best to simply be ourselves. If someone finds you attractive, good for you. If you both find each other attractive, well then, maybe you've really got something there worth developing together!Featured video:\nDon Henley and Dolly Parton sing, \"When I Stop Dreaming\"2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 45, "api_path": "/songs/35432", "artist_names": "Nine", "full_title": "Whutcha Want? by\u00a0Nine", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/b872fd3dfd05766d3f2082200905ce29.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b872fd3dfd05766d3f2082200905ce29.600x600x1.jpg", "id": 35432, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 50, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1588527037, "path": "/Nine-whutcha-want-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 3, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Nine-whutcha-want-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1995, "month": 1, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "January 1, 1995", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jan. 1, 1995", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/b872fd3dfd05766d3f2082200905ce29.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b872fd3dfd05766d3f2082200905ce29.600x600x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 26, "hot": false, "pageviews": 16228}, "title": "Whutcha Want?", "title_with_featured": "Whutcha Want?", "updated_by_human_at": 1588527037, "url": "https://genius.com/Nine-whutcha-want-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/2637", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3a7d36799425d43a4483acd0012d2c56.310x310x1.jpg", "id": 2637, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3a7d36799425d43a4483acd0012d2c56.310x310x1.jpg", "index_character": "n", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Nine", "slug": "Nine", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Nine"}, "artist": "Nine", "lyrics": "Whutcha Want?

in the darkness with a weapon to cut some stranger down\nSleeping with an empty bottle, he's a sad and an empty hearted man\nAll he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can\n\n[Chorus 1]\nWe always need to hear both sides of the story\nBoth sides of the story\n\n[Verse 2]\nA neighbourhood peace is shattered it's the middle of the night\nYoung faces hide in the shadows, while they watch their mother and father fight\nHe says she's been unfaithful, she says her love for him has gone\nAnd the brother shrugs to his sister and says \"looks like it's just us from now on\"\n[Chorus 1]\nAll we always need to hear both sides of the story\nWe need to hear both sides of the story\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd the lights are all on, the world is watching now\nPeople looking for truth, we must not fail them now\nBe sure, before we close our eyes\nDon't walk away from here\nUntil you hear both sides\n\n[Verse 3]\nHere we are all gathered in what seems to be the center of the storm\nNeighbors once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn\nThey've been fighting here for years, but now there's killing on the streets\nWhile small coffins are lined up sadly, now united in defeat\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAll we always need to hear both sides of the story\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd the lights are all on, the world is watching now\nPeople looking for truth, we must not fail them now\nBe sure, before we close our eyes\nDon't walk away from here\nUntil you see both sides\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nWhite man turns the corner, finds himself within a different world\nGhetto kid grabs his shoulder, throws him up against the wall\nHe says \"Would you respect me if I didn't have this gun\"\n\"Because without it, I don't get it, and that's why I carry one\"\n\n[Outro]\nWe always need to hear both sides of the story\nBoth sides of the story\nOh, both sides of the story\nYes, both sides of the story\nOh, both sides of the story\nBoth sides of the

a shag\nWhen I went to school, I carried lunch in a bag\nWith a apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss\nAlways got mad when the class was dismissed\nBut when it was in session, I always had a question\nI would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and\nHelp me with my problem, it was never much\nJust a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch\nOh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug\nShe was married to the man, he was a thug\nHis name was Lee, he drove a Z\nHe'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock\nI was on her jock, yes indeedy, I wrote graffiti on the bus\nFirst I'd write her name, then carve a plus\nWith my name last, on the looking glass\nI seen her yesterday, but still, I had to let her pass\n[Chorus]\nShe keeps on passin' me by\nShe keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on pass\u2014\n\n[Verse 2: SlimKid 3]\nWhen I dream of fairytales, I think of me and Shelly\nSee, she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me\nThat I should quit chasin' and look for something better\nBut the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter\nI haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her\nI just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture\nI'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger\nShe could be my broad and I could be her nigga, but\nAll I could do was stare\nBack as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare\nNow she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated\nNot at all overrated, I think I need a prayer\nTo get in her book and it looks rather dry\nI guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye\nAlthough she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop her stride\n'Cause I won't have no more of this passin' me by\n\n[Verse 3: Imani]\nTime for me to voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me\nSprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie\nShe was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan\nDamn, she looked good, downside, she had a man\nHe was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop\nShe told me, \"Soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop\"\nShe was a flake like corn and I was born not to understand\nBy letting her pass, I proved to be a better man\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nShe keeps on passin' me by (Passing me by)\nShe keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passin' me\u2014\n\n[Verse 4: Fatlip]\nNow there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian\nAnd now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-\nEver she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye\nOverlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?\nWait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence\nAnd I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence\nFrom a distance I desired her, secretly admired her\nWired her a letter to get her, and it went\n\"My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me, but I know you\nVery well, now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I have for you\nWhen I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp\nDamn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp\n'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so and if I was your man, then I would be true\nThe only lying I would do is in the bed with you\"\nThen I signed \"Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, P.S. Love Me Tender\"\nThe letter came back three days later \"Return to Sender\", damn\n\n[Chorus]\nShe keeps on passin' me by\nShe keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on pass\u2014\n[Post-Chorus]\nNevertheless, I'll say it again (Passing me by)\nNevertheless, I'll say it again\nNevertheless\u2014\nNevertheless\u2014\nNevertheless, I'll say it again\n\n[Outro]\nShe keeps passin' me by\nShe keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)\nShe keeps passin' me by\nShe keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)\nShe keeps passin' me by\nShe keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)\nShe keeps passin' me by\nShe keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)52Embed"}]
