fighting for\nWe all go and waste our time\nBut we are all the same\nAll we do is just to tun away\nAnd play the same old game\nYou know the broken hearted\nWhen you look in my eyes you see\nIs it my life that's changing\nAnd getting away from me\nWhy do we run from the cover of love\nWhy do we run from the cover of love\nThe changing heart knows no bound\nTime may stand still\nEmotions keep turning the fire burns on and on\nYou know the broken hearted\nWhen you look in my eyes you'll see\nIs it my life that's changing\nAnd getting away from me\nWhy do we run from the cover of love\nWhy

wanna tell her\nShe's the girl of my fantasy\nHow we meet in my dreams every night it seems\nAnd how love can be, I wanna (love you)\nI'm gonna be (your love)\nIt's not everyday you see the one\nThat your heart's been nightly dreaming of\nThere's that look in her eyes, so I don't know why\nShe won't talk to me, she won't talk to me\n\nShe pretends she doesn't see me\nLeaves me standing in the

But Trouble Lyrics[Intro: Fresh Prince]\nListen homeboys, don't mean to bust your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhyme and get the hell away\n\n[Verse One]\nJust last week when I was walking down the street\nI observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet\nI walked up to her I said hello\nShe said: \"Hey, you're kind of cute\" I said: \"Yes, I know, but...\nBy the way, sweetheart, what's your name?\"\nShe said: \"My friends like to call me Exotic Elaine\"\nI said: \"My name is the Prince\" and she said: \"Why?\"\nI said: \"Well, I don't know, I'm just a hell of a guy!\nBut enough about me, yo, let's talk about you\nAnd all the wonderful things that you and I can do\"\nI popped some trash and in a little bit of time\nI showed some cash and the girl was mine\nI took her over town, I wined her and dined her\nShe asked me 'did I like her?' I said: \"Well... kinda\"\nAll of a sudden, she jumped out her seat\nSnatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street\nShe started grabbin all over me, kissin' and huggin'\nSo I shoved her away, I said: \"You better stop buggin'!\"\nShe got mad, looked me dead in my face\nThrew her hands in the air and yelled out: \"Rape!\"\nI got scared when she started to yell\nSo I handed her my wallet and ran like hell\nI was duckin' through alleys right and left\nBut when the cops caught up, they almost beat me to death\nI was arrested, charged with aggravated assault\n(Hey, yo Clancy, we got him!) But it wasn't my fault!\n[Chorus: Fresh Prince]\nNevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhyme and get the hell away\n\n[Verse Two]\nI was in a bar one Friday night\nCoolin', watchin' a Mike Tyson fight\nI was maxin' and relaxin', sippin' on tequila\nWhen this girl walked up, she said: \"Hi, my name is Sheila\"\nI responded by saying hello\nShe paid for my drink and then said: \"Let's go\"\n20 minutes later, things were starting to cook\nAs we pulled up into her house, I said: \"I'm with you, toots\"\nThe music was soft and there was wine in the glasses\nShe started winking and making little passes\nAt me, she grabbed me close and that's when she got bold\nShe started feeling up my back, I said: \"Oh, your hands are cold!\"\nWe went into her bedroom thinking of one thing\nTook the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring\nI carresed her body and I kissed her cheek\nAnd that's when I observed those satin bed sheets\nI felt that it was time for me to make my move\nI thought I better hurry up before I busted the groove\nI leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue\nA door slammed and a voice said: \"Baby, where are you?\"\nHer boyfriend busted in, he grinned an evil grin\nAnd said: \"Boy, I'mma tear your butt limb from limb!\"\nI was scared as hell, where was I supposed to go?\nI just yelled: \"Geronimo!\" and jumped out the window\nJust my luck we were in a snow storm\nAnd all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm\nAnd to top the night off, I had to break in my place\nBecause my keys were in my pants back on Sheila's book case\nI was done, sneezin' and coughin'... (Aaa-choo!)\nI hope this doesn't happen too often, but\nYou might also like[Chorus: The Fresh Prince]\nNevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhyme and get the hell away\n\n[Spoken interlude]\n[Jazzy] Yo man, you think they see your point?\n[Prince] I don't know, I don't think they really get it, man...\n[Jazzy] I think you should give 'em another example!\n[Prince] Aight, give me a scratch, let's make it funky right here...\n\n[Verse Three]\nI got a ring on my phone, May 5th last year\nIt was my girlfriend Betty, I said: \"Hello dear!\nI was just about to call you\nI got a couple tickets to the Run-D.M.C. concert\" (I'm wit' it)\n\"It's six o'clock now, at eight will you be ready?\" (Yeah)\n\"Aight, fine, see you then, Betty\"\nI combed my hair, washed, and brushed my teeth\nGot funky fresh dressed in my Le Coq Sportif\nGot to Betty's at eight, I was ready to jet\nUntil Betty's mom said: \"Betty's not ready yet!\"\nI sat there for at least an hour\nIt was ten after nine before she got in the shower\n9:35, she comes downstairs\nAnd said: \"I need a little longer to finish my hair\"\nAt ten o'clock, we had been missed the show\nShe comes downstairs and says 'let's go'!?\n\"Go where? Go to sleep, I'm gone!\"\nI was steamin' like a demon as I drove home\n[Outro: Fresh Prince]\nBut it just goes to show not trying to bust your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhyme\nJust remember my rhymes\nTake heed to my rhymes and get the hell away!\n\n[Outro]\n[Jazzy] Man, first your parents just don't understand...\n[Prince] I know, right, man...\n[Jazzy] Then you have these crazy nightmares...\n[Prince] Look, why me?

Du Bois", "lyrics": "Darkwater (Chap. 9) LyricsOf Beauty And Death\n\nFor long years we of the world gone wild have looked into the face of death and smiled. Through all our bitter tears we knew how beautiful it was to die for that which our souls called sufficient. Like all true beauty this thing of dying was so simple, so matter-of-fact. The boy clothed in his splendid youth stood before us and laughed in his own jolly way,\u2014went and was gone. Suddenly the world was full of the fragrance of sacrifice. We left our digging and burden-bearing; we turned from our scraping and twisting of things and words; we paused from our hurrying hither and thither and walking up and down, and asked in half-whisper: this Death\u2014is this Life? And is its beauty real or false? And of this heart-questioning I am writing.\n\nMy friend, who is pale and positive, said to me yesterday, as the tired sun was nodding:\n\n\"You are too sensitive.\"\n\nI admit, I am\u2014sensitive. I am artificial. I cringe or am bumptious or immobile. I am intellectually dishonest, art-blind, and I lack humor.\n\n\"Why don't you stop all this?\" she retorts triumphantly.\nYou will not let us.\n\n\"There you go, again. You know that I\u2014\"\n\nWait! I answer. Wait!\n\nI arise at seven. The milkman has neglected me. He pays little attention to colored districts. My white neighbor glares elaborately. I walk softly, lest I disturb him. The children jeer as I pass to work. The women in the street car withdraw their skirts or prefer to stand. The policeman is truculent. The elevator man hates to serve Negroes. My job is insecure because the white union wants it and does not want me. I try to lunch, but no place near will serve me. I go forty blocks to Marshall's, but the Committee of Fourteen closes Marshall's; they say white women frequent it.\n\n\"Do all eating places discriminate?\"\n\nNo, but how shall I know which do not\u2014except\u2014\n\nI hurry home through crowds. They mutter or get angry. I go to a mass-meeting. They stare. I go to a church. \"We don't admit niggers!\"\n\nOr perhaps I leave the beaten track. I seek new work. \"Our employees would not work with you; our customers would object.\"\n\nI ask to help in social uplift.\n\n\"Why\u2014er\u2014we will write you.\"\n\nI enter the free field of science. Every laboratory door is closed and no endowments are available.\n\nI seek the universal mistress, Art; the studio door is locked.\n\nI write literature. \"We cannot publish stories of colored folks of that type.\" It's the only type I know.\nThis is my life. It makes me idiotic. It gives me artificial problems. I hesitate, I rush, I waver. In fine,\u2014I am sensitive!\n\nMy pale friend looks at me with disbelief and curling tongue.\n\n\"Do you mean to sit there and tell me that this is what happens to you each day?\"\n\nCertainly not, I answer low.\n\n\"Then you only fear it will happen?\"\n\nI fear!\n\n\"Well, haven't you the courage to rise above a\u2014almost a craven fear?\"\n\nQuite\u2014quite craven is my fear, I admit; but the terrible thing is\u2014these things do happen!\n\n\"But you just said\u2014\"\n\nThey do happen. Not all each day,\u2014surely not. But now and then\u2014now seldom, now, sudden; now after a week, now in a chain of awful minutes; not everywhere, but anywhere\u2014in Boston, in Atlanta. That's the hell of it. Imagine spending your life looking for insults or for hiding places from them\u2014shrinking (instinctively and despite desperate bolsterings of courage) from blows that are not always but ever; not each day, but each week, each month, each year. Just, perhaps, as you have choked back the craven fear and cried, \"I am and will be the master of my\u2014\"\n\n\"No more tickets downstairs; here's one to the smoking gallery.\"\n\nYou hesitate. You beat back your suspicions. After all, a cigarette with Charlie Chaplin\u2014then a white man pushes by\u2014\n\n\"Three in the orchestra.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\" And in he goes.\n\nSuddenly your heart chills. You turn yourself away toward the golden twinkle of the purple night and hesitate again. What's the use? Why not always yield\u2014always take what's offered,\u2014always bow to force, whether of cannon or dislike? Then the great fear surges in your soul, the real fear\u2014the fear beside which other fears are vain imaginings; the fear lest right there and then you are losing your own soul; that you are losing your own soul and the soul of a people; that millions of unborn children, black and gold and mauve, are being there and then despoiled by you because you are a coward and dare not fight!\n\nSuddenly that silly orchestra seat and the cavorting of a comedian with funny feet become matters of life, death, and immortality; you grasp the pillars of the universe and strain as you sway back to that befrilled ticket girl. You grip your soul for riot and murder. You choke and sputter, and she seeing that you are about to make a \"fuss\" obeys her orders and throws the tickets at you in contempt. Then you slink to your seat and crouch in the darkness before the film, with every tissue burning! The miserable wave of reaction engulfs you. To think of compelling puppies to take your hard-earned money; fattening hogs to hate you and yours; forcing your way among cheap and tawdry idiots\u2014God! What a night of pleasure!\n\nHere, then, is beauty and ugliness, a wide vision of world-sacrifice, a fierce gleam of world-hate. Which is life and what is death and how shall we face so tantalizing a contradiction? Any explanation must necessarily be subtle and involved. No pert and easy word of encouragement, no merely dark despair, can lay hold of the roots of these things. And first and before all, we cannot forget that this world is beautiful. Grant all its ugliness and sin\u2014the petty, horrible snarl of its putrid threads, which few have seen more near or more often than I\u2014notwithstanding all this, the beauty of this world is not to be denied.\n\nCasting my eyes about I dare not let them rest on the beauty of Love and Friend, for even if my tongue were cunning enough to sing this, the revelation of reality here is too sacred and the fancy too untrue. Of one world-beauty alone may we at once be brutally frank and that is the glory of physical nature; this, though the last of beauties, is divine!\n\nAnd so, too, there are depths of human degradation which it is not fair for us to probe. With all their horrible prevalence, we cannot call them natural. But may we not compare the least of the world's beauty with the least of its ugliness\u2014not murder, starvation, and rapine, with love and friendship and creation\u2014but the glory of sea and sky and city, with the little hatefulnesses and thoughtfulnesses of race prejudice, that out of such juxtaposition we may, perhaps, deduce some rule of beauty and life\u2014or death?\n\nThere mountains hurl themselves against the stars and at their feet lie black and leaden seas. Above float clouds\u2014white, gray, and inken, while the clear, impalpable air springs and sparkles like new wine. Last night we floated on the calm bosom of the sea in the southernmost haven of Mount Desert. The water flamed and sparkled. The sun had gone, but above the crooked back of cumulus clouds, dark and pink with radiance, and on the other sky aloft to the eastward piled the gorgeous-curtained mists of evening. The radiance faded and a shadowy velvet veiled the mountains, a humid depth of gloom behind which lurked all the mysteries of life and death, while above, the clouds hung ashen and dull; lights twinkled and flashed along the shore, boats glided in the twilight, and the little puffing of motors droned away. Then was the hour to talk of life and the meaning of life, while above gleamed silently, suddenly, star on star.\n\nBar Harbor lies beneath a mighty mountain, a great, bare, black mountain that sleeps above the town; but as you leave, it rises suddenly, threateningly, until far away on Frenchman's Bay it looms above the town in withering vastness, as if to call all that little world petty save itself. Beneath the cool, wide stare of that great mountain, men cannot live as giddily as in some lesser summer's playground. Before the unveiled face of nature, as it lies naked on the Maine coast, rises a certain human awe.\n\nGod molded his world largely and mightily off this marvelous coast and meant that in the tired days of life men should come and worship here and renew their spirit. This I have done and turning I go to work again. As we go, ever the mountains of Mount Desert rise and greet us on our going\u2014somber, rock-ribbed and silent, looking unmoved on the moving world, yet conscious of their everlasting strength.\n\nAbout us beats the sea\u2014the sail-flecked, restless sea, humming its tune about our flying keel, unmindful of the voices of men. The land sinks to meadows, black pine forests, with here and there a blue and wistful mountain. Then there are islands\u2014bold rocks above the sea, curled meadows; through and about them roll ships, weather-beaten and patched of sail, strong-hulled and smoking, light gray and shining. All the colors of the sea lie about us\u2014gray and yellowing greens and doubtful blues, blacks not quite black, tinted silvers and golds and dreaming whites. Long tongues of dark and golden land lick far out into the tossing waters, and the white gulls sail and scream above them. It is a mighty coast\u2014ground out and pounded, scarred, crushed, and carven in massive, frightful lineaments. Everywhere stand the pines\u2014the little dark and steadfast pines that smile not, neither weep, but wait and wait. Near us lie isles of flesh and blood, white cottages, tiled and meadowed. Afar lie shadow-lands, high mist-hidden hills, mountains boldly limned, yet shading to the sky, faint and unreal.\n\nWe skirt the pine-clad shores, chary of men, and know how bitterly winter kisses these lonely shores to fill yon row of beaked ice houses that creep up the hills. We are sailing due westward and the sun, yet two hours high, is blazoning a fiery glory on the sea that spreads and gleams like some broad, jeweled trail, to where the blue and distant shadow-land lifts its carven front aloft, leaving, as it gropes, shades of shadows beyond.\n\nWhy do not those who are scarred in the world's battle and hurt by its hardness travel to these places of beauty and drown themselves in the utter joy of life? I asked this once sitting in a Southern home. Outside the spring of a Georgia February was luring gold to the bushes and languor to the soft air. Around me sat color in human flesh\u2014brown that crimsoned readily; dim soft-yellow that escaped description; cream-like duskiness that shadowed to rich tints of autumn leaves. And yet a suggested journey in the world brought no response.\n\n\"I should think you would like to travel,\" said the white one.\n\nBut no, the thought of a journey seemed to depress them.\n\nDid you ever see a \"Jim-Crow\" waiting-room? There are always exceptions, as at Greensboro\u2014but usually there is no heat in winter and no air in summer; with undisturbed loafers and train hands and broken, disreputable settees; to buy a ticket is torture; you stand and stand and wait and wait until every white person at the \"other window\" is waited on. Then the tired agent yells across, because all the tickets and money are over there\u2014\n\n\"What d'ye want? What? Where?\"\n\nThe agent browbeats and contradicts you, hurries and confuses the ignorant, gives many persons the wrong change, compels some to purchase their tickets on the train at a higher price, and sends you and me out on the platform, burning with indignation and hatred!\n\nThe \"Jim-Crow\" car is up next the baggage car and engine. It stops out beyond the covering in the rain or sun or dust. Usually there is no step to help you climb on and often the car is a smoker cut in two and you must pass through the white smokers or else they pass through your part, with swagger and noise and stares. Your compartment is a half or a quarter or an eighth of the oldest car in service on the road. Unless it happens to be a thorough express, the plush is caked with dirt, the floor is grimy, and the windows dirty. An impertinent white newsboy occupies two seats at the end of the car and importunes you to the point of rage to buy cheap candy, Coco-Cola, and worthless, if not vulgar, books. He yells and swaggers, while a continued stream of white men saunters back and forth from the smoker to buy and hear. The white train crew from the baggage car uses the \"Jim-Crow\" to lounge in and perform their toilet. The conductor appropriates two seats for himself and his papers and yells gruffly for your tickets before the train has scarcely started. It is best not to ask him for information even in the gentlest tones. His information is for white persons chiefly. It is difficult to get lunch or clean water. Lunch rooms either don't serve niggers or serve them at some dirty and ill-attended hole in the wall. As for toilet rooms,\u2014don't! If you have to change cars, be wary of junctions which are usually without accommodation and filled with quarrelsome white persons who hate a \"darky dressed up.\" You are apt to have the company of a sheriff and a couple of meek or sullen black prisoners on part of your way and dirty colored section hands will pour in toward night and drive you to the smallest corner.\n\n\"No,\" said the little lady in the corner (she looked like an ivory cameo and her dress flowed on her like a caress), \"we don't travel much.\"\n\nPessimism is cowardice. The man who cannot frankly acknowledge the \"Jim-Crow\" car as a fact and yet live and hope is simply afraid either of himself or of the world. There is not in the world a more disgraceful denial of human brotherhood than the \"Jim-Crow\" car of the southern United States; but, too, just as true, there is nothing more beautiful in the universe than sunset and moonlight on Montego Bay in far Jamaica. And both things are true and both belong to this our world, and neither can be denied.\n\nThe sun, prepared to cross that awful border which men call Night and Death, marshals his hosts. I seem to see the spears of mighty horsemen flash golden in the light; empurpled banners flame afar, and the low thunder of marching hosts thrills with the thunder of the sea. Athwart his own path, screening a face of fire, he throws cloud masses, masking his trained guns. And then the miracle is done. The host passes with roar too vast for human ear and the sun is set, leaving the frightened moon and blinded stars.\n\nIn the dusk the green-gold palms turn their star-like faces and stretch their fan-like fingers, lifting themselves proudly, lest any lordly leaf should know the taint of earth.\n\nOut from the isle the serpent hill thrusts its great length around the bay, shouldering back the waters and the shadows. Ghost rains sweep down, smearing his rugged sides, yet on he writhes, undulant with pine and palm, gleaming until his low, sharp head and lambent tongue, grown gray and pale and silver in the dying day, kisses the molten gold of the golden sea.\n\nThen comes the moon. Like fireflies nesting in the hand of God gleams the city, dim-swathed by fairy palms. A long, thin thumb, mist-mighty, points shadowy to the Spanish Main, while through the fingers foam the Seven Seas. Above the calm and gold-green moon, beneath the wind-wet earth; and here, alone, my soul enchained, enchanted!\n\nFrom such heights of holiness men turn to master the world. All the pettiness of life drops away and it becomes a great battle before the Lord. His trumpet,\u2014where does it sound and whither? I go. I saw Montego Bay at the beginning of the World War. The cry for service as high as heaven, as wide as human feeling, seemed filling the earth. What were petty slights, silly insults, paltry problems, beside this call to do and dare and die? We black folk offered our services to fight. What happened? Most Americans have forgotten the extraordinary series of events which worked the feelings of black America to fever heat.\n\nFirst was the refusal to accept Negro volunteers for the army, except in the four black regiments already established. While the nation was combing the country for volunteers for the regular army, it would not let the American Negro furnish even his proportionate quota of regular soldiers. This led to some grim bantering among Negroes:\n\n\"Why do you want to volunteer?\" asked many. \"Why should you fight for this country?\"\n\nBefore we had chance to reply to this, there came the army draft bill and the proposal by Vardaman and his ilk to except Negroes. We protested to Washington in various ways, and while we were insisting that colored men should be drafted just as other citizens, the bill went through with two little \"jokers.\"\n\nFirst, it provided that Negroes should be drafted, but trained in \"separate\" units; and, secondly, it somewhat ambiguously permitted men to be drafted for \"labor.\"\n\nA wave of fear and unrest spread among Negroes and while we were looking at both these provisions askance, suddenly we received the draft registration blank. It directed persons \"of African descent\" to \"tear off the corner!\" Probably never before in the history of the United States has a portion of the citizens been so openly and crassly discriminated against by action of the general government. It was disheartening, and on top of it came the celebrated \"German plots.\" It was alleged in various parts of the country with singular unanimity that Germans were working among the Negroes, and it was further intimated that this would make the Negroes too dangerous an element to trust with guns. To us, of course, it looked as though the discovery and the proposition came from the same thinly-veiled sources.\n\nConsidering carefully this series of happenings the American Negro sensed an approaching crisis and faced a puzzling dilemma. Here was evidently preparing fertile ground for the spread of disloyalty and resentment among the black masses, as they were forced to choose apparently between forced labor or a \"Jim-Crow\" draft. Manifestly when a minority group is thus segregated and forced out of the nation, they can in reason do but one thing\u2014take advantage of the disadvantage. In this case we demanded colored officers for the colored troops.\n\nGeneral Wood was early approached and asked to admit suitable candidates to Plattsburg. He refused. We thereupon pressed the government for a \"separate\" camp for the training of Negro officers. Not only did the War Department hesitate at this request, but strong opposition arose among colored people themselves. They said we were going too far. \"We will obey the law, but to ask for voluntary segregation is to insult ourselves.\" But strong, sober second thought came to our rescue. We said to our protesting brothers: \"We face a condition, not a theory. There is not the slightest chance of our being admitted to white camps; therefore, it is either a case of a 'Jim-Crow' officers' training camp or no colored officers. Of the two things no colored officers would be the greater calamity.\"\n\nThus we gradually made up our minds. But the War Department still hesitated. It was besieged, and when it presented its final argument, \"We have no place for such a camp,\" the trustees of Howard University said: \"Take our campus.\" Eventually twelve hundred colored cadets were assembled at Fort Des Moines for officers' training.\n\nThe city of Des Moines promptly protested, but it finally changed its mind. Des Moines never before had seen such a class of colored men. They rapidly became popular with all classes and many encomiums were passed upon their conduct. Their commanding colonel pronounced their work first class and declared that they presented excellent material for officers.\n\nMeantime, with one accord, the thought of the colored people turned toward Colonel Young, their highest officer in the regular army. Charles Young is a heroic figure. He is the typical soldier,\u2014silent, uncomplaining, brave, and efficient! From his days at West Point throughout his thirty years of service he has taken whatever task was assigned him and performed it efficiently; and there is no doubt but that the army has been almost merciless in the requirements which it has put upon this splendid officer. He came through all with flying colors. In Haiti, in Liberia, in western camps, in the Sequoia Forests of California, and finally with Pershing in Mexico,\u2014in every case he triumphed. Just at the time we were looking to the United States government to call him to head the colored officers' training at Des Moines, he was retired from the army, because of \"high blood pressure!\" There is no disputing army surgeons and their judgment in this case may be justified, but coming at the time it did, nearly every Negro in the United States believed that the \"high blood pressure\" that retired Colonel Young was in the prejudiced heads of the Southern oligarchy who were determined that no American Negro should ever wear the stars of a General.\n\nTo say that Negroes of the United States were disheartened at the retirement of Colonel Young is to put it mildly,\u2014but there was more trouble. The provision that Negroes must be trained separately looked simple and was simple in places where there were large Negro contingents, but in the North with solitary Negroes drafted here and there we had some extraordinary developments. Regiments appeared with one Negro where the Negro had to be separated like a pest and put into a house or even a village by himself while the commander frantically telegraphed to Washington. Small wonder that one poor fellow in Ohio solved the problem by cutting his throat. The whole process of drafting Negroes had to be held up until the government could find methods and places for assembling them.\n\nThen came Houston. In a moment the nation forgot the whole record of one of the most celebrated regiments in the United States Army and its splendid service in the Indian Wars and in the Philippines. It was the first regiment mobilized in the Spanish-American War and it was the regiment that volunteered to a man to clean up the yellow fever camps when others hesitated. It was one of the regiments to which Pershing said in December:\n\n\"Men, I am authorized by Congress to tell you all that our people back in the States are mightily glad and proud at the way the soldiers have conducted themselves while in Mexico, and I, General Pershing, can say with pride that a finer body of men never stood under the flag of our nation than we find here tonight.\"\n\nThe nation, also, forgot the deep resentment mixed with the pale ghost of fear which Negro soldiers call up in the breasts of the white South. It is not so much that they fear that the Negro will strike if he gets a chance, but rather that they assume with curious unanimity that he has reason to strike, that any other persons in his circumstances or treated as he is would rebel. Instead of seeking to relieve the cause of such a possible feeling, most of them strain every effort to bottle up the black man's resentment. Is it inconceivable that now and then it bursts all bounds, as at Brownsville and Houston?\n\nSo in the midst of this mental turmoil came Houston and East St. Louis. At Houston black soldiers, goaded and insulted, suddenly went wild and \"shot up\" the town. At East St. Louis white strikers on war work killed and mobbed Negro workingmen, and as a result 19 colored soldiers were hanged and 51 imprisoned for life for killing 17 whites at Houston, while for killing 125 Negroes in East St. Louis, 20 white men were imprisoned, none for more than 15 years, and 10 colored men with them.\n\nOnce upon a time I took a great journey in this land to three of the ends of our world and over seven thousand mighty miles. I saw the grim desert and the high ramparts of the Rocky Mountains. Three days I flew from the silver beauty of Seattle to the somber whirl of Kansas City. Three days I flew from the brute might of Chicago to the air of the Angels in California, scented with golden flowers, where the homes of men crouch low and loving on the good, broad earth, as though they were kissing her blossoms. Three days I flew through the empire of Texas, but all these shall be tales untold, for in all this journey I saw but one thing that lived and will live eternal in my soul,\u2014the Grand Ca\u00f1on.\n\nIt is a sudden void in the bosom of the earth, down to its entrails\u2014a wound where the dull titanic knife has turned and twisted in the hole, leaving its edges livid, scarred, jagged, and pulsing over the white, and red, and purple of its mighty flesh, while down below\u2014down, down below, in black and severed vein, boils the dull and sullen flood of the Colorado.\n\nIt is awful. There can be nothing like it. It is the earth and sky gone stark and raving mad. The mountains up-twirled, disbodied and inverted, stand on their peaks and throw their bowels to the sky. Their earth is air; their ether blood-red rock engreened. You stand upon their roots and fall into their pinnacles, a mighty mile.\n\nBehold this mauve and purple mocking of time and space! See yonder peak! No human foot has trod it. Into that blue shadow only the eye of God has looked. Listen to the accents of that gorge which mutters: \"Before Abraham was, I am.\" Is yonder wall a hedge of black or is it the rampart between heaven and hell? I see greens,\u2014is it moss or giant pines? I see specks that may be boulders. Ever the winds sigh and drop into those sun-swept silences. Ever the gorge lies motionless, unmoved, until I fear. It is a grim thing, unholy, terrible! It is human\u2014some mighty drama unseen, unheard, is playing there its tragedies or mocking comedy, and the laugh of endless years is shrieking onward from peak to peak, unheard, unechoed, and unknown.\n\nOne throws a rock into the abyss. It gives back no sound. It falls on silence\u2014the voice of its thunders cannot reach so far. It is not\u2014it cannot be a mere, inert, unfeeling, brute fact\u2014its grandeur is too serene\u2014its beauty too divine! It is not red, and blue, and green, but, ah! the shadows and the shades of all the world, glad colorings touched with a hesitant spiritual delicacy. What does it mean\u2014what does it mean? Tell me, black and boiling water!\n\nIt is not real. It is but shadows. The shading of eternity. Last night yonder tesselated palace was gloom\u2014dark, brooding thought and sin, while hither rose the mountains of the sun, golden, blazing, ensanguined. It was a dream. This blue and brilliant morning shows all those burning peaks alight, while here, shapeless, mistful, brood the shadowed towers.\n\nI have been down into the entrails of earth\u2014down, down by straight and staring cliffs\u2014down by sounding waters and sun-strewn meadows; down by green pastures and still waters, by great, steep chasms\u2014down by the gnarled and twisted fists of God to the deep, sad moan of the yellow river that did this thing of wonder,\u2014a little winding river with death in its depth and a crown of glory in its flying hair.\n\nI have seen what eye of man was never meant to see. I have profaned the sanctuary. I have looked upon the dread disrobing of the Night, and yet I live. Ere I hid my head she was standing in her cavern halls, glowing coldly westward\u2014her feet were blackness: her robes, empurpled, flowed mistily from shoulder down in formless folds of folds; her head, pine-crowned, was set with jeweled stars. I turned away and dreamed\u2014the ca\u00f1on,\u2014the awful, its depths called; its heights shuddered. Then suddenly I arose and looked. Her robes were falling. At dim-dawn they hung purplish-green and black. Slowly she stripped them from her gaunt and shapely limbs\u2014her cold, gray garments shot with shadows stood revealed. Down dropped the black-blue robes, gray-pearled and slipped, leaving a filmy, silken, misty thing, and underneath I glimpsed her limbs of utter light.\n\nMy God! For what am I thankful this night? For nothing. For nothing but the most commonplace of commonplaces; a table of gentlewomen and gentlemen\u2014soft-spoken, sweet-tempered, full of human sympathy, who made me, a stranger, one of them. Ours was a fellowship of common books, common knowledge, mighty aims. We could laugh and joke and think as friends\u2014and the Thing\u2014the hateful, murderous, dirty Thing which in American we call \"Nigger-hatred\" was not only not there\u2014it could not even be understood. It was a curious monstrosity at which civilized folk laughed or looked puzzled. There was no elegant and elaborate condescension of\u2014\"We once had a colored servant\"\u2014\"My father was an Abolitionist\"\u2014\"I've always been interested in your people\"\u2014there was only the community of kindred souls, the delicate reverence for the Thought that led, the quick deference to the guest. You left in quiet regret, knowing that they were not discussing you behind your back with lies and license. God! It was simply human decency and I had to be thankful for it because I am an American Negro, and white America, with saving exceptions, is cruel to everything that has black blood\u2014and this was Paris, in the years of salvation, 1919. Fellow blacks, we must join the democracy of Europe.\n\nToul! Dim through the deepening dark of early afternoon, I saw its towers gloom dusky toward the murk of heaven. We wound in misty roads and dropped upon the city through the great throats of its walled bastions. There lay France\u2014a strange, unknown, unfamiliar France. The city was dispossessed. Through its streets\u2014its narrow, winding streets, old and low and dark, carven and quaint,\u2014poured thousands upon thousands of strange feet of khaki-clad foreigners, and the echoes threw back awkward syllables that were never French. Here was France beaten to her knees yet fighting as never nation fought before, calling in her death agony across the seas till her help came and with all its strut and careless braggadocio saved the worthiest nation of the world from the wickedest fate ever plotted by Fools.\n\nTim Brimm was playing by the town-pump. Tim Brimm and the bugles of Harlem blared in the little streets of Maron in far Lorraine. The tiny streets were seas of mud. Dank mist and rain sifted through the cold air above the blue Moselle. Soldiers\u2014soldiers everywhere\u2014black soldiers, boys of Washington, Alabama, Philadelphia, Mississippi. Wild and sweet and wooing leapt the strains upon the air. French children gazed in wonder\u2014women left their washing. Up in the window stood a black Major, a Captain, a Teacher, and I\u2014with tears behind our smiling eyes. Tim Brimm was playing by the town-pump.\n\nThe audience was framed in smoke. It rose ghost-like out of memories\u2014bitter memories of the officer near dead of pneumonia whose pain was lighted up by the nurses waiting to know whether he must be \"Jim-Crowed\" with privates or not. Memories of that great last morning when the thunders of hell called the Ninety-second to its last drive. Memories of bitter humiliations, determined triumphs, great victories, and bugle-calls that sounded from earth to heaven. Like memories framed in the breath of God, my audience peered in upon me\u2014good, brown faces with great, kind, beautiful eyes\u2014black soldiers of America rescuing beloved France\u2014and the words came in praise and benediction there in the \"Y,\" with its little stock of cigarettes and candies and its rusty wood stove.\n\n\"Alors,\" said Madame, \"quatre sont morts\"\u2014four dead\u2014four tall, strong sons dead for France\u2014sons like the sweet and blue-eyed daughter who was hiding her brave smile in the dusk. It was a tiny stone house whose front window lipped the passing sidewalk where ever tramped the feet of black soldiers marching home. There was a cavernous wardrobe, a great fireplace invaded by a new and jaunty iron stove. Vast, thick piles of bedding rose in yonder corner. Without was the crowded kitchen and up a half-stair was our bedroom that gave upon a tiny court with arched stone staircase and one green tree. We were a touching family party held together by a great sorrow and a great joy. How we laughed over the salad that got brandy instead of vinegar\u2014how we ate the golden pile of fried potatoes and how we pored over the post-card from the Lieutenant of the Senegalese\u2014dear little vale of crushed and risen France, in the day when Negroes went \"over the top\" at Pont-\u00e0-Mousson.\n\nParis, Paris by purple fa\u00e7ade of the opera, the crowd on the Boulevard des Italiens and the great swing of the Champs Elys\u00e9es. But not the Paris the world knows. Paris with its soul cut to the core\u2014feverish, crowded, nervous, hurried; full of uniforms and mourning bands, with caf\u00e9s closed at 9:30\u2014no sugar, scarce bread, and tears so interwined with joy that there is scant difference. Paris has been dreaming a nightmare, and though she awakes, the grim terror is upon her\u2014it lies on the sand-closed art treasures of the Louvre. Only the flowers are there, always the flowers, the Roses of England and the Lilies of France.\n\nNew York! Behind the Liberty that faces free France rise the white cliffs of Manhattan, tier on tier, with a curving pinnacle, towers square and twin, a giant inkwell daintily stoppered, an ancient pyramid enthroned; beneath, low ramparts wide and mighty; while above, faint-limned against the turbulent sky, looms the vast grace of that Cathedral of the Purchased and Purchasing Poor, topping the world and pointing higher.\n\nYonder the gray cobwebs of the Brooklyn bridges leap the sea, and here creep the argosies from all earth's ends. We move to this swift home on dun and swelling waters and hear as we come the heartbeats of the new world.\n\nNew York and night from the Brooklyn Bridge: The bees and fireflies flit and twinkle in their vast hives; curved clouds like the breath of gods hover between the towers and the moon. One hears the hiss of lightnings, the deep thunder of human things, and a fevered breathing as of some attendant and invincible Powers. The glow of burning millions melts outward into dim and fairy outlines until afar the liquid music born of rushing crowds drips like a benediction on the sea.\n\nNew York and morning: the sun is kissing the timid dew in Central Park, and from the Fountain of Plenty one looks along that world street, Fifth Avenue, and walks toward town. The earth life and curves graciously down from the older mansions of princes to the newer shops of luxury. Egypt and Abyssinia, Paris and Damascus, London and India caress you by the way; churches stand aloof while the shops swell to emporiums. But all this is nothing. Everything is mankind. Humanity stands and flies and walks and rolls about\u2014the poor, the priceless, the world-known and the forgotten; child and grandfather, king and leman\u2014the pageant of the world goes by, set in a frame of stone and jewels, clothed in scarlet and rags. Princes Street and the Elysian Fields, the Strand and the Ringstrasse\u2014these are the Ways of the World today.\n\nNew York and twilight, there where the Sixth Avenue \"L\" rises and leaps above the tenements into the free air at 110th Street. It circles like a bird with heaven and St. John's above and earth and the sweet green and gold of the Park beneath. Beyond lie all the blue mists and mysteries of distance; beneath, the city rushes and crawls. Behind echo all the roar and war and care and maze of the wide city set in its sullen darkening walls, flashing weird and crimson farewells. Out at the sides the stars twinkle.\n\nAgain New York and Night and Harlem. A dark city of fifty thousand rises like magic from the earth. Gone is the white world, the pale lips, the lank hair; gone is the West and North\u2014the East and South is here triumphant. The street is crowd and leisure and laughter. Everywhere black eyes, black and brown, and frizzled hair curled and sleek, and skins that riot with luscious color and deep, burning blood. Humanity is packed dense in high piles of close-knit homes that lie in layers above gray shops of food and clothes and drink, with here and there a moving-picture show. Orators declaim on the corners, lovers lark in the streets, gamblers glide by the saloons, workers lounge wearily home. Children scream and run and frolic, and all is good and human and beautiful and ugly and evil, even as Life is elsewhere.\n\nAnd then\u2014the Veil. It drops as drops the night on southern seas\u2014vast, sudden, unanswering. There is Hate behind it, and Cruelty and Tears. As one peers through its intricate, unfathomable pattern of ancient, old, old design, one sees blood and guilt and misunderstanding. And yet it hangs there, this Veil, between Then and Now, between Pale and Colored and Black and White\u2014between You and Me. Surely it is a thought-thing, tenuous, intangible; yet just as surely is it true and terrible and not in our little day may you and I lift it. We may feverishly unravel its edges and even climb slow with giant shears to where its ringed and gilded top nestles close to the throne of God. But as we work and climb we shall see through streaming eyes and hear with aching ears, lynching and murder, cheating and despising, degrading and lying, so flashed and fleshed through this vast hanging darkness that the Doer never sees the Deed and the Victim knows not the Victor and Each hates All in wild and bitter ignorance. Listen, O Isles, to these Voices from within the Veil, for they portray the most human hurt of the Twentieth Cycle of that poor Jesus who was called the Christ!\n\nThere is something in the nature of Beauty that demands an end. Ugliness may be indefinite. It may trail off into gray endlessness. But Beauty must be complete\u2014whether it be a field of poppies or a great life,\u2014it must end, and the End is part and triumph of the Beauty. I know there are those who envisage a beauty eternal. But I cannot. I can dream of great and never-ending processions of beautiful things and visions and acts. But each must be complete or it cannot for me exist.\n\nOn the other hand, Ugliness to me is eternal, not in the essence but in its incompleteness; but its eternity does not daunt me, for its eternal unfulfilment is a cause of joy. There is in it nothing new or unexpected; it is the old evil stretching out and ever seeking the end it cannot find; it may coil and writhe and recur in endless battle to days without end, but it is the same human ill and bitter hurt. But Beauty is fulfilment. It satisfies. It is always new and strange. It is the reasonable thing. Its end is Death\u2014the sweet silence of perfection, the calm and balance of utter music. Therein is the triumph of Beauty.\n\nSo strong is the spell of beauty that there are those who, contradicting their own knowledge and experience, try to say that all is beauty. They are called optimists, and they lie. All is not beauty. Ugliness and hate and ill are here with all their contradiction and illogic; they will always be here\u2014perhaps, God send, with lessened volume and force, but here and eternal, while beauty triumphs in its great completion\u2014Death. We cannot conjure the end of all ugliness in eternal beauty, for beauty by its very being and definition has in each definition its ends and limits; but while beauty lies implicit and revealed in its end, ugliness writhes on in darkness forever. So the ugliness of continual birth fulfils itself and conquers gloriously only in the beautiful end, Death.\n\nAt last to us all comes happiness, there in the Court of Peace, where the dead lie so still and calm and good. If we were not dead we would lie and listen to the flowers grow. We would hear the birds sing and see how the rain rises and blushes and burns and pales and dies in beauty. We would see spring, summer, and the red riot of autumn, and then in winter, beneath the soft white snow, sleep and dream of dreams. But we know that being dead, our Happiness is a fine and finished thing and that ten, a hundred, and a thousand years, we shall lie at rest, unhurt in the Court of Peace.\n\nThe Prayers of God\n\nName of God's Name!\nRed murder reigns;\nAll hell is loose;\nOn gold autumnal air\nWalk grinning devils, barbed and hoofed;\nWhile high on hills of hate,\nBlack-blossomed, crimson-sky'd,\nThou sittest, dumb.\nFather Almighty!\nThis earth is mad!\nPalsied, our cunning hands;\nRotten, our gold;\nOur argosies reel and stagger\nOver empty seas;\nAll the long aisles\nOf Thy Great Temples, God,\nStink with the entrails\nOf our souls.\nAnd Thou art dumb.\nAbove the thunder of Thy Thunders, Lord,\nLightening Thy Lightnings,\nRings and roars\nThe dark damnation\nOf this hell of war.\nRed piles the pulp of hearts and heads\nAnd little children's hands.\nAllah!\nElohim!\nVery God of God!\nDeath is here!\nDead are the living; deep\u2014dead the dead.\nDying are earth's unborn\u2014\n\nThe babes' wide eyes of genius and of joy,\nPoems and prayers, sun-glows and earth-songs,\nGreat-pictured dreams,\nEnmarbled phantasies,\nHigh hymning heavens\u2014all\nIn this dread night\nWrithe and shriek and choke and die\nThis long ghost-night\u2014\n\nWhile Thou art dumb.\nHave mercy!\nHave mercy upon us, miserable sinners!\nStand forth, unveil Thy Face,\nPour down the light\nThat seethes above Thy Throne,\nAnd blaze this devil's dance to darkness!\nHear!\nSpeak!\nIn Christ's Great Name\u2014\n\nI hear!\nForgive me, God!\nAbove the thunder I hearkened;\nBeneath the silence, now,\u2014\n\nI hear!\n(Wait, God, a little space.\nIt is so strange to talk with Thee\u2014\n\nAlone!)\nThis gold?\nI took it.\nIs it Thine?\nForgive; I did not know.\nBlood?

I sleep!\nWhat was that awful word Thou saidst?\nThat black and riven thing\u2014was it Thee?\nThat gasp\u2014was it Thine?\nThis pain\u2014is it Thine?\nAre, then, these bullets piercing Thee?\nHave all the wars of all the world,\nDown all dim time, drawn blood from Thee?\nHave all the lies and thefts and hates\u2014\n\nIs this Thy Crucifixion, God,\nAnd not that funny, little cross,\nWith vinegar and thorns?\nIs this Thy kingdom here, not there,\nThis stone and stucco drift of dreams?\nHelp!\nI sense that low and awful cry\u2014\n\nWho cries?\nWho weeps?\nWith silent sob that rends and tears\u2014\n\nCan God sob?\nWho prays?\nI hear strong prayers throng by,\nLike mighty winds on dusky moors\u2014\n\nCan God pray?\nPrayest Thou, Lord, and to me?\nThou needest me?\nThou needest me?\nThou needest me?\nPoor, wounded soul!\nOf this I never dreamed. I thought\u2014\n\nCourage, God,\nI come!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/1658820", "artist_names": "Squeeze", "full_title": "853-5937 by\u00a0Squeeze",

"Love Always Lyrics[Verse 1:]\nI got a secret for you\nCan't believe myself\nBut ever since you've been gone\nI think of no one else\nI've even tried to forget\nBut nothing can make me\n\nI know that it's so hard to be true\nUnder the summer skies\nI'll write your name in my book\nAt least a thousand times\nAnd every day you're away\nIt's driving me crazy\n[Chorus:]\nSo I'll write you every night\nAnd I'll sign my name\n\"Love always\"\nAnd even if the sun falls down\n\nI will always be around\nForever and always\nDarling\nIf we both can wait\nWe'll have a time to celebrate\nFor the rest of our lives\nLove always\n\n[Verse 2:]\nAnd lots of people I know\nTry to shape your mind\nBut that can't happen to me\n\nI'm not the jealous kind\nNo one can change what I feel\nAnd nothing can make me\n\nStill\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\nYou might also likeFor the best of our lives\nLove always\nFor the rest of our lives\n\n[Bridge:]\nWe'll always be\nSo faithfully\nJust hang on to me forever\n\n[Chorus:]\nSo I'll write you every night\nAnd I'll sign my name\n\"Love always\"\nOh\n\nAnd if by now you haven't guessed\nI will add one more P.S\nFor the rest of our lives\nLove always\nFor the best of our lives\nLove always\n\nI'll sign this letter to you\n\"Love always\"\nOh, know it\nOh, oh, oh\nI love you, baby\nOh\nAnd if I do over and over again\nSign my name over in full\nAnd at the end\nAnd rest of our lives, love always\nLove always\n\nOoh, girl\nSounds so good to me, mmm\nFor the rest of our lives\nLove always, oh\nFor the rest of our lives\nLove always, oh da

can't sleep a wink\nI can't live without your love\n\nI tried to fight it, tried to hide it\nJust another passing flame, well\nHere today and gone tomorrow\nBut with you the fire raged\n\nOver my mind, body and soul baby\nYou took complete control\nI'm on the verge of going crazy maybe\nYou're all I want\nDon't you leave me in the cold\n\nI'm restless, I can't sleep a wink\nCan't live without

and a life of his own\nBut the freedom that he found wasn't quite as sweet\nWhen the truth was known\n[Chorus]\nI have prayed for America\nI was made for America\nIt's in my blood and in my bones\nBy the dawn's early light\nBy all I know is right\nWe're gonna reap what we have sown\n\n[Verse 2]\nAs if freedom was a question of might\nAs if loyalty was black and white\nYou hear people say it all the time\n\"My country wrong or right\"\nI want to know what that's got to do\nWith what it takes to find out what's true\nWith everyone from the President on down\nTrying to keep it from you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe thing I wonder about the Dads and Moms\nWho send their sons to the Vietnams\nWill they really think their way of life\nHas been protected as the next war comes?\n\n[Chorus]\nI

at me\nI gotta say -\n\nChorus:\nPull up your sox\nYou're the boy in the box\nWhat did the rebel say?\nWhen the wolf cried \"fox\"\nTo the boy in the box\nWill you come out to play\n\nOne, two\nYou can't get enough\nThree, four\nOpen up the door\nSix, five\nAlive is the boy in the box\n\n(I gotta say)\nChorus\nYou might also likeAnd no-one talks\nTo the boy in the box\nWhen the world cried \"fox\"\nTo the boy in the box\n\nOne, two\nI can't get enough\nThree, four\nOpen up the door\nSix, five\nAlive is the boy in the box\n\nLike a boy in the box\nThe boy in the box\nLike a boy in the boxEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 13, "api_path": "/songs/1304859", "artist_names": "Oingo Boingo", "full_title": "Weird Science by\u00a0Oingo\u00a0Boingo",

feel?\nWhy did you let it begin?\nWhat did she whisper and what did it mean?\nAnd where do you think it'll end?\nHow long did it last?\nDo you think it'll stop?\nDid you get to try anything new?\nHow good was she, honestly?\nWhere did you go and\nWho made the very first move?\nWho made the very first move?\nWho made the very first move?\n[Verse]\nYou don't have to sneak in the doorway\nJust come on into the room\nI've been lying in our bed in the dark all alone\nAnd I've been waiting, I've been waiting for you\nThere's been no reason to move\nIt's been as still as a tomb\nI needed you oh so badly tonight\nBut I guess you had better things to do\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI should have known that it was coming to this\nBut I must have been blind\nI bet you still got a trace of her love in your eyes\nAnd you've still got her eyes on your mind\nYou swore you'd be with me at seven o'clock\nNow it's a quarter to three\nAnd whatever you got and whoever it was\nI guess you couldn't get it from me\nWhatever you got and whoever it was\nI guess you couldn't get it from me\n\n[Chorus]\nI know that you love me\nThere's no need to talk\nI see the look in your eyes and I got the proof\nAnd there are no lies on your body\nAs I see you undress, oh-oh-ooh\nI just want to get at the truth\nI know that you love me\nThere's no need to talk\nI see the look in your eyes and I got the proof\nAnd there are no lies on your body\nAs I watch you undress (I watch you undress)\nI just want to get at the truth\nYou might also like[Post-Chorus]\nAnd there are so many things that I've just got to know\nYou tell me who, you tell me where, you tell me when\nBut don't tell me now, I don't need any answers tonight\n\n[Bridge]\nI just need some love\nSo turn out the lights, and I'll be left in the dark again\nI just need some love (Just need some love)\nSo turn out the lights, and I'll be left in the dark again\nI just need some love (Just need some love)\nSo turn out the lights, and I'll be left in the dark again\nLeft in the dark again\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI should have known that it was coming to this\nBut I must have been blind\nI bet you still got a trace of her love in your eyes\nAnd you've still got her eyes on your mind\nYou swore you'd be with me at seven o'clock\nNow it's a quarter to three\nAnd whatever you got and whoever it was\nI guess you couldn't get it from me\nWhatever you got and whoever it was\nI guess you couldn't get it from me\nI guess you couldn't get it from me\nBut down in my soul, down in my soul, I know\n[Chorus]\nI know that you love me (I know that you love me)\nThere's no need to talk (There's no need to talk)\nI see the look in your eyes and I got the proof\n('Cause the look in your eyes, I got the proof)\nAnd there are no lies on your body\nAs I watch you undress (I watch you undress)\nI just want to get at the truth\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAnd there are so many things that I've just got to know\nYou tell me who, you tell me where, you tell me when\nBut don't tell me now, I don't need any answers tonight\n\n[Outro]\nI just need some love\nSo turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again\nI just need some love (Just need some love)\nSo turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again\n(Left in the dark again)\nI just need some love (Just need some love)\nSo turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again\n(Left in the dark again)\nI just need some love (Just need some love)\nSo turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again\n(Left in the dark again)\nI just need some love (Just need some

die, though i try to believe its gone\nOnce truth is always true\nThe last time i made love, i made it with you\nNow lovers come and go\nPeople give themselves too easily\nBut through it all how sweet
