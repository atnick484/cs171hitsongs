tell, I excel, then prevail\nThe mic is contacted, I attract clientele\nMy mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath\nI exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps\nDeep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond\nSneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'\nHit the Earth like a comet\u2014invasion!\nNas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'\n\u2018Cause in my physical I can express through song\nDelete stress like Motrin, then extend strong\nI drink Mo\u00ebt with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell\nFrom the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell\n[Verse 2]\nThe buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up\nNot stories by Aesop\nPlace your loot up, parties I shoot up\nNas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L\nSchool a fool well, you feel it like Braille\nIt ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill\nVocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic\nI freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik\nJam like a TEC with correct techniques\nSo analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me\nScannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me\nI leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose\nNas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell\n[Verse 3]\nThis rhythmatic explosion\nIs what your frame of mind has chosen\nI'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen\nSpeak with criminal slang, begin like a violin\nEnd like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again\nWisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop\nI dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles\nStreet's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle\nAnd groove even smoother than moves by Villanova\nYou're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra\nPackin' like a Rasta in the weed spot\nVocals will squeeze Glocks\nMCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak\nMy poetry's deep, I never fell\nNas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tellSee Nas LiveGet tickets as low as $80You might also like124Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/4768956", "artist_names": "Spotify", "full_title": "New Music Friday 08/09/19 by\u00a0Spotify", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/aaf01cc319a32dda02b3e1c4b70224e6.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/aaf01cc319a32dda02b3e1c4b70224e6.1000x1000x1.png", "id": 4768956, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 5637607, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1565464193, "path": "/Spotify-new-music-friday-08-09-19-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Spotify-new-music-friday-08-09-19-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/aaf01cc319a32dda02b3e1c4b70224e6.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/aaf01cc319a32dda02b3e1c4b70224e6.1000x1000x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "New Music Friday 08/09/19", "title_with_featured": "New Music Friday 08/09/19", "updated_by_human_at": 1565464193, "url": "https://genius.com/Spotify-new-music-friday-08-09-19-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/69342", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/da32597113461492089ce24af5568ab7.1000x419x1.png", "id": 69342, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4d7925a03026cc6d993484d2712b75e9.709x709x1.png", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Spotify", "slug": "Spotify", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Spotify"}, "artist": "Spotify", "lyrics": "New Music Friday 08/09/19 LyricsBazzi - No Way!\nMegan Thee Stallion - Hot Girl Summer (feat.

sailing\nOn an emerald bay\nAnd like a boat out on the ocean\nI'm rocking you to sleep\nThe water's dark\nAnd deep inside this ancient heart\nYou'll always be a part of me\n\n[Verse 3]\nGoodnight, my angel\nNow it's time to dream\nAnd dream how wonderful\nYour life will be\nSomeday your child may cry\nAnd if you sing this lullaby\nThen in your heart\nThere will always be a part of

everybody still calling me a rapper?\nI'm an artist, I just rap for fun, but still do it the hardest\nShould've known that I was comin' like the song I did with Marcus\nOnce I hops in the beat, dispose of the carcass\nI remember when I started, people tried to call me stupid\nSo I took the liberty to level up and go retarded\nThis ain't mainstream music, I see red when I rap\nDon't compare me to these people who see red on a carpet\nSo I took off to another dimension\nTh\u0435re's no birds here in spac\u0435, I ain't seeing ya mentions\nNiggas claim I ain't shit then go use my shit\nTo get them views, notoriety and fucking attention\nIt's a famine in this industry, a rap recession\nThe only substance is abuse, let me cut the tension\nI'm bringing real rap back\nI was sent by the greats and I swore I would fucking protect it\n[Chorus]\nThis a killshot, everybody knows it\nI'm coming, I'm making noise, but they acting like they ain't hearing me\nIndependent rapper who got it straight out the mud\nWhen nobody was showing love, pussy nigga, I'm the epitome\nKillshot, never took a handout from no one\nI got it popping myself and I kept my dignity\nInspired by the greats and then Father, Son, that's a trinity\nAnd I don't give a fuck if you hating or you ain't feeling me\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, these people hate it when you're self-made\nIt's blue flame when I burst and disperse rage\nDon't gotta physically tussle, I let my words play\nKnew I was special 'cause the bus I took back in first grade\nMama told me don't listen, they don't know pain\nNo-names playing with me, but ain't got no game\nI don't miss, whatever I drop hits\nIt's a stretch if you running with me, I sweat propane\nKick it, flip it, I'm skating laps around these fucking gimmicks\nI'm wicked, twisted, I'm half insane and diagnosed as gifted\nMy words vertically exceed the rollercoaster limit\nThat's why when they try to ride along, they fucking miss it\nI'm painting pictures too perfect to pick apart and diss it\nThey don't got the knowledge, their strength and integrity is missing\nI remember days when my streaming numbers were pots to piss in\nPeople tried to talk, but they couldn't see that I had a vision\nEminem done paved a path, Pac saw me in a dream\nJ. Cole can really hoop, we should play on the same team\nDriving down the lane, he could kick it to me for three\nTwo, one, beating these buzzers and taking straight leads\nI'm half amazing, the other half is the energy\nOf every great poet, Shakespearian-type MC\nMozart, Bach, Beethoven inspired melodies\nCadence from an angel that's devilish, yet heavenly\nWatch how I summon the beast, watch how my mouth is foaming\nWhen I step in the booth and I know I'm 'bout to fuck up a beat\nWatch how I slow it down for you\nThen bring it back up to Usain Bolt world record speed\nAlpha male, better flow, my LMs don't know Ps\nSo I stay on my Q 'cause they sleeping just like straight Zs\nNiggas hate on me, then I see them go try and copy\n'Cause I'm spitting these facts, so they printing them like machines\nGimme the mic, gimme the booth, gimme the beat that Lex produced\nGimme the strength to fill the shoes of the greats and deliver truth\nGimme the tools to fuel the youth, replenish, spend then recoup\nThen redirect negativity pointed at me to you\nGimme the chance to redo, review, remove any excuse\nAnd push through any obstruction or rule that tries to reduce\nMy mathematical flow that adds me in every room\nBut subtracts me from the trash that they've been force feeding to you\nHonestly I might quit\nI miss my janitor job and the long night shifts\nI stick to myself 'cause my touch is Midas\nTrust, everything that I touch spreads like virus\nI don't give a fuck if you hate or you don't like this\nI don't lend flows, my last name ain't Bias\nI can't be bought, my music is priceless\nAnd I've been all in their mouth like bronchitis\nNiggas be trash, they buy it, I'm so sick of the music climate\nScuba diving, swimming into the mainstream with the sharks and stealing like a pirate\nFucking up giants, David, you're Goliath\nTrumping the game, I'll Joe your Biden\nWanna be me, the only thing you'll ever be is Hepatitis\nNiggas be talking like I ain't the nicest-meanest flow, it drips Poseidon\nWord play concepts blow your mind with triple entend's and perfect timing\nI'm in constant rhyming, morning, night, I'm constantly grinding\nWho's better? I don't care but I know I'm top five greatest of all time and\nListen, I'm fuckin' here, yeah, it ain't a mistake\nAnd with the shit I've already dropped, I can't be erased\nReplaced, removed, and I'ma do whatever it takes\nTo have a seat at the table with the rest of greats\nI ain't focused on the beef 'less we talking some steak\n'Cause I got too much at it to step out of my lane\nI said it once in the beginning and I'll say it again\nI went from stupid to retarded, now I'm going insane\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThis a killshot, everybody knows it\nI'm coming, I'm making noise, but they acting like they ain't hearing me\nIndependent rapper who got it straight out the mud\nWhen nobody was showing love, pussy nigga, I'm the epitome\nKillshot, never took a handout from no one\nI got it popping myself and I kept my dignity\nInspired by the greats and then Father, Son, that's a trinity\nAnd I don't give a fuck if you hating or you ain't feeling me\n\n[Outro]\nSay less, do more, it's Dax4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1010734", "artist_names": "FireHouse", "full_title": "Sleeping With You by\u00a0FireHouse", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/f47189c8ef1a420f2e0ca8331e85388d.300x266x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f47189c8ef1a420f2e0ca8331e85388d.599x532x1.jpg", "id": 1010734, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429587697, "path": "/Firehouse-sleeping-with-you-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Firehouse-sleeping-with-you-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1992, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1992", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1992", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/f47189c8ef1a420f2e0ca8331e85388d.300x266x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f47189c8ef1a420f2e0ca8331e85388d.599x532x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Sleeping With You", "title_with_featured": "Sleeping With You", "updated_by_human_at": 1659461804, "url": "https://genius.com/Firehouse-sleeping-with-you-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/332529", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c04ba2c902bd7de0e469b8ac094f4493.271x271x1.jpg", "id": 332529, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c04ba2c902bd7de0e469b8ac094f4493.271x271x1.jpg", "index_character": "f", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "FireHouse", "slug": "Firehouse", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Firehouse"}, "artist": "FireHouse", "lyrics": "Sleeping With You LyricsI don't care what they say\nI know this is right\nBecause I feel it deep in my heart\nThey say we're young and wild\nAnd we should wait for a while\nBut nothing's gonna keep us apart\n\nBut I don't think we're living in sin\nSo we can't give up, we can't give in\nBecause our love is strong, and it can't be wrong\nOo and it feels so right\nSo I'll be sleeping with you tonight\nWe'll be together tonight\nI don't care if it's wrong or right\nI'll be sleeping with you\nSleeping with you tonight\n\nSo let's give it a try.

get down\nI'm on the floor, besides the door\nThe sound is rich, and I ain't poor\nI'm looking for Susie or Wendy or Judy\nBut look at her (but look at her)\nBut look at her\n(Who me?)\nYes, you sweetie, although it's hard to see thee\nI see your silhouette and what I see has got me needy\nI need you for a second of your time\nBut then I reckon that a second is too short let me try\n(You're slamming!)\nBut anyway, I'd like to say\nI'm Dres of the Black Sheep givin' you play\nStep out in the light, come show off yourself\nYo, I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else\n[Chorus]\nI gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)\nI gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)\nI gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)\nJust don't know \"Why?\" Hon, I just don't know\nI gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)\nI gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)\nI gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)\nSee something ain't right \"Why?\" It's the strobe light\n\n[Interlude]\n[Mista Lawnge]\nVan Damme, Oh man, now you look out\nI can not dig it, I can not dig it\nNo, Black yo, I can not dig it\n\n[Dres, Strobelite Honey]\nListen Hon, I mean aaaaaah\nIt was nice looking at you, I just have to go\nMy man is right over there\n(Where you going?)\nI have to go my - Huh?\nI'm on my way Black, I'm on my -\n(Don't you have a number or something?)\nListen it's uh, seven six five, four three two one\n(Wh-what area code is that?)\nOne, nine-hundred\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nListen here dear, step to the rear\nFind yourself a seat, buy yourself a beer\nEat some pretzels, go play some videos\nThank you for your time honey but ho I gotta go\nI think I lost my coat, and plus I'm double parked\nI thought you was my girl, you see I can't see in the dark\nAnyway I'm out, out is what I be\nI've got to step\n(With the viscosity)\nWhen you see a honey by the strobe light\nBlack I hope you got good sight\nFor honey that you see, like a Shakespeare soliloquy\nMay or may not be, all that\nIn fact, quite wack\nWith the girl that makes you stop tracks\nBut neither here nor there fear\nUnless, of course, you don't care\nListen baby girl, let me say it slow\nI-have-to-go\nNot to dis, but let's disperse\nYo, I'll see you later, unless I see you first\n\n[Chorus]\nI gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)\nI

the boy move with a hell of a swag\nIt's like the soundtrack to my life\nEveryday I'm under investigation\nBut I will not stop so you can stop the hating\nWhat more can I say? It's like my gift and my curse\nTo fail or succeed, I don't know whats worse\nI don't know what's worse\nAgents tryna find a glitch in my matrix\nOne slip and I'm back to the basics\nRed or blue pill, what would you do?\nWhen the same niggas you love got hate in their blood\n\nI know god's watching over me, so is the Fed's\nWhen love turns to hate and niggas rather you dead\nLord have mercy, Jesus Christ\nAll the bad I've done, will you still protect my life?\n\nMaybe, maybe not\nUntil then, I keep an extra clip for that Glock\nYou wanna see my bank statement\nI got no problems with that\nThree hundred thousand, you know I'm smarter than that\n\nI been dodging the alphabet boys all my life\nSo, you gonna need more than a child support lawyer\nI got some child support for you\nGet off your ass bitch and get you a job\n\nTell your other three baby daddy's to sell dope or rob\nMy son got everything in the world that I never had\nOne thing you can't call me is a deadbeat dad\nWhen you're

mind\n\nI only talk in the bedroom, we whisper in the kitchen\nCall me paranoid, I think the walls is listening\nBut if them walls could talk\nI'd prolly never get to see the daylight\n\nI gave it to 'em raw, mixtape after mixtape\nI had niggas waiting on the album\nI shoulda got five mic's in the Source\nInstead I got five bricks and a Porsche\nThey say I ain't lyrical\n\nI wasn't tryna impress y'all niggas\nIf hating was a crime, they'd arrest ya niggas\nKink bought the mic, I just gave him my life\nThe streets co-signed, the hood gave me my stripes\nI said, the streets co-signed, the hood

fact, I'm better than ever\nThey can't box me in, that boy too clever\n\nSo CNN worried 'bout little ol' me\nFuck the bitch ass reporter who wrote the story\nYou motherfuckers don't know shit about me\nWhat I been through or where I came from\nWhen shit got hard, I stayed, I ain't run\n\nSo you can blame the government, they made me this way\nSee the pain in my eyes, you don't see me cry\nTwo

bricks\n\nHow the hell you expect me to be drug free?\nWhen George Bush ain't never done shit for me\nFollow me home and tap my phone\nWhat happened to my freedom of speech?\n\nLove don't love nobody\nGot me feelin' like I shouldn't love myself\nI practice what I preach, I preach what I practice\nA hundred thou under my mattress\n\nI'm only human, just a man\nGod gave me a gift to do the best that I can\nCritics say I can't make an album better than my first one\nThe way I feel, that'll prolly be my worst one\n\nAnother one after that will be better than my last\nSo real talk, y'all can kiss my ass\nThis is the beginning of the beginning\nI am the future\n\nYou niggas are a thing of the past\nI'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've become\nSo all you ridicule lookin' I'm not the

Well you should handle this well\nWhen these two leave him face down, it's just the hands you were dealt\nI said, everyday, you can see Pete on his grind\nYou know, changin' the world, one tweet at a time\nBut lately, even the Twitter feed's been gettin' a little uninspired\nI mean, how many fuckin' times can we call Tomi Lahren a \"fuckin' dumpster fire\"\nI mean, I guess you gotta crack a few eggs to make an omelette bitch\nLet's start with the Twitter profile that you be arguin' with\nOff line you be awkward as shit, but online you be talkin' that shit\nBet you wouldn't even talk to a bitch if you didn't have battle rap in your back pocket as a bargaining chip\nOh which reminds me, whatever happened to your ahh, little girlfriend?\nYou don't remember that?\nLike the girl you tweet everyday and if you didn't then your world end\nEveryday it's \"I love you baby\" like they're racin' to see who say it quicker\nIt's not like we're the only ones that were amazed you was even in a relationship with her\nI don't give a fuck what that bitch made you for dinner\nIf you get up in my face, I'ma make you a quitter\nSee while you was up north gettin' your dick wet with some Canadian filler\nI was back in Oakland High like Damian Lillard\nI said, so what's up?\nLet's treat it like it's only us in the room\nKeep it real bro, who broke up with who?\nShe broke up with you?\nI'm just sayin' if you keep gettin' us invested in these relationships we gonna need some fuckin' closure too\nI said, this is not a subject you can dance around Pete\nI just got one last question for you bro\nKeep it real, on God\nDid she ask about me?\nNo?\nNothing?\nFine if that's the case I can go back to sayin' that you been trash for days\nYou need to get off the fuckin' internet and act your age\nCause you're clearly going through a tragic phase\nLike Dizaster's braids\n[Round 2: The Saurus]\nAye turn your haircut down I can't hear myself!\n\nAlright, so what do you call Pete without a girlfriend?\nFocused\nNow, now what do you call Caustic without a girlfriend?\nHomeless\nHold up! It's time for me to murder you now\nThis would be the part where I have an amazing rebuttal but I was too busy tweeting during your round\nAin't gon' be nothin' of Caustic left\nFor the autopsy to give the cause of death\n\n{Chokes and starts freestyling}\n\nFuck it, we're just going to go through the motions, cause of death\nOh my God, let me stop a sec'\nWhy did I go for extra flips\n\n[Caustic]\nIt's all part of it.

I'm not breeding livestock\nYou 'bout to catch a heavy cross, the one Jesus Christ got\nMy God I wish I could go back to Scribble '06\n\n[Caustic]\nI bet\n\n[The Saurus]\nSo I could show my old self

a little girl, with you I'm not a man\nWhen all the hurt inside of me comes out, you understand\nYou see that I'm ferocious, you see that I am weak\nYou see that I am silly, and pretentious, and a freak\nBut I don't feel too strange for you\nDon't know exactly what you do\nI think when love is pure you try\nTo understand the reasons why\nAnd I prefer this mystery\nIt cancels out my misery\nAnd gives me hope that there could be\nA person that loves me\n[Chorus]\nRescue me (Rescue me, it's hard to believe)\nYour love has given me hope\nRescue me (Rescue me, it's hard to believe)\nI'm drowning, baby throw out your rope\n\n[Verse 2]\nWith you I'm not a fascist, can't play you like a toy\nAnd when I need to dominate, you're not my little boy\nYou see that I am hungry for a life of understanding\nAnd you forgive my angry little heart when she's demanding\nYou bring me to my knees while I'm scratching out the eyes\nOf a world I want to conquer, and deliver, and despise\nAnd right while I am kneeling there\nI suddenly begin to care\nAnd understand that there could be\nA person that loves me\n\n[Chorus]\nRescue me (Rescue me, it's hard to believe)\nYour love has given me hope\nRescue me (Rescue me, it's hard to believe)\nI'm drowning, baby throw out your rope\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nLove is understanding\nIts hard to believe life can be so demanding\nI'm sending out an

locals here I've had to sell my home\nToo proud to leave, I work my fingers to the bone\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I could own my downeaster \"Alexa\"\nAnd I go where the ocean is deep\nThere are giants out there in the canyons\nAnd a good captain can't fall asleep\nI got bills to pay and children who need clothes\nI know there's fish out there, but where God only knows\nThey say these waters aren't what they used to be\nBut I got people back on land who count on me\n[Verse 3]\nSo if you see my downeaster \"Alexa\"\nAnd if you work with the rod and the reel\nTell my wife I am trolling Atlantis\nAnd I still have my hands on the wheel\n\n[Bridge]\nYay-o\nYay-o\nYay-o\nYay-yay-o\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow I drive my downeaster \"Alexa\"\nMore and more miles from shore every year\nSince they told me I can't sell no stripers\nAnd there's no luck in swordfishing here\nI was a bayman like my father was before\nCan't make a living as a bayman anymore\nThere ain't much future for a man who works the sea\nBut there ain't no island left for islanders like me\n\n[Outro]\nYay-yay-yay-o\nYay-yay-yay-o\nYay-yay-yay-o\nYay-yay-yay-oSee Billy Joel LiveGet tickets as low as $66You might also like11Embed"},

ran to your heart to be near\nAnd we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close\nHow I always held close in your fear\n[Verse 3]\nRemembering you running soft through the night\nYou were bigger and brighter and wider than snow\nAnd screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky\nAnd you finally found all your courage to let it all go\n\n[Verse 4]\nRemembering you fallen into my arms\nCrying for the death of your heart\nYou were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold\nYou were always so lost in the dark\n\n[Verse 5]\nRemembering you, how you used to be\nSlow drowned, you were angels\nSo much more than everything\nHold for the last time then slip away quietly\nOpen my eyes, but I never see anything\n\n[Bridge]\nIf only I'd thought of the right words\nI could have held on to

the blissfully dead\nLooking for the victim shivering in bed\nSearching out fear in the gathering gloom\nAnd suddenly a movement in the corner of the room\nAnd there is nothing I can do when I realise with fright\nThat the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight\n[Verse 2]\nQuietly he laughs and shaking his head\nCreeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed\nAnd softer than shadow and quicker than flies\nHis arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes\nBe still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy\nDon't struggle like that or I will only love you more\nFor it's much too late to get away or turn on the light\nThe spiderman is having you for dinner tonight\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I feel like I'm being eaten\nBy a thousand million shivering, furry holes\nAnd I know that in the morning\nI will wake up in the shivering cold\nAnd the spiderman is always hungry\n\n[Outro]\n\"Come into my parlor,\" said the spider to the fly\n\"I have a little something here\"You might also like33Embed"},

got me feinin' and gawking\nA fool is what I'm feeling\nBut see baby that's fine\nI bought some blue suede shoes this time\nTo do some stepping\nAnd do some stomping\nHanging out with the guys and the girls, do some romping\nDance and play and shout and everything's cool\nYou put a boot in your mouth fool\nYou might also like(These boots are made for walking)\n(That's just what they'll do)\n(One of these days this boots are gonna walk all over you)\n\n(Are you ready boots?)\n(Start walking)Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1012611", "artist_names":

train in seconds flat\nAll the time I'm listening to my radio\n\nAround the block, to the corner\nYou can hear it all night long\nOn the roof and out on Broadway\nWhen the radio is on\nYou can rock around the clock\nBecause you know the beat goes on\nThey'll be dancing in the streets\nBecause the radio is on\n\nMy whole life long has been one big song\nBut all my parents ever said was \"Turn it down\"\nEven with my homework blasting out the cool jerk\nLiving for the latest sound\nAnd every special event, has a particular tune\nThat's the way that I remember everything I do\nMy first romance ooh we used to dance to the man with the Blue Suede shoes\n\nFrom the eastside to the westside\nUptown funk and downtown soul\nI go downtown and I'm listening to my radio\n\nAround the block, to the corner\nYou can hear it all night long\nOn the roof and out on Broadway\nWhen the radio is on\nYou can rock around the clock\nBecause you know the beat goes on\nThey'll be dancing in the

I'm sure of it.\nKIRK: You said you discovered a new food concentrate. What am I supposed to put in my log, that you lied? That you diverted a starship with false information? You're not only in trouble, you've put me in trouble, too.\nLEIGHTON: I did it to trap Kodos!\nKIRK: Kodos is dead.\nLEIGHTON: Is he? Is anyone sure? A body burned beyond recognition?\nKIRK: Tom, the authorities closed the book on that case years ago.\nLEIGHTON: Then let's reopen it. Jim, four thousand people were butchered.\nKIRK: Martha, you tell him.\nMARTHA: I can't tell him anything, Jim. He's been like this since the company of actors arrived.\nKIRK: Kodos is dead. I'm satisfied of that.\nLEIGHTON: Well, I'm not. I remember him. That voice. The bloody thing he did.\n(He turns his head to reveal it's not just an eyepatch, but a covering over half his face)\nLEIGHTON: Jim, Jim, I need your help. There were only eight or nine of us who actually saw Kodos. I was one, you were another. If he's to be exposed,\nKIRK: He's dead.\nLEIGHTON: Then it will be a ghost Martha and I receive in our home tonight. I invited the entire company to a cocktail party.

Mister?\nKIRK: Captain James Kirk, Starship Enterprise.\nLENORE: We are honoured.\nKIRK: I had hoped to meet your father, here, tonight, personally.\nLENORE: I'm sorry, Captain Kirk. He has a rigid rule about that. He never sees anyone personally, and he never attends parties.\nKIRK: An actor turning away his admirers? Very unusual.\nLENORE: Karidian is a most unusual man. You saw Macbeth. That was my father.\nKIRK: Then I'll talk to Lady Macbeth.\n(They sit)\nLENORE: So. Captain of the Enterprise. Interesting.\nKIRK: So, Lady Macbeth. Interesting. What's your next move?\nLENORE: We play two performances at Benecia, if the AstraI Queen can get us there.\nKIRK: She's a good ship. (takes a glass from a passing tray) Thank you. You were very impressive as Lady Macbeth.\nLENORE: Thank you. And as Lenore Karidian?\nKIRK: Very impressive. Lenore. I'd like to see you again.\nLENORE: You mean professionally?\nKIRK: Not necessarily.\nLENORE: I think I'd like that.

Not a ship's Captain with all those people to be strong and confident in front of. You know, you're really very dear, aren't you? In some ways, very lonely.\n(But just as their lips are about to meet, Kirk spots a body among the rocks and goes to investigate)\nKIRK: It's Tom Leighton. He's dead.\n\n[Leighton's home]\n\n(Tom's body is laid out on the couch, and Martha covers it)\nMARTHA: At least he has peace now. He never really had that before. Oh, why was Tom killed if what he suspected wasn't true?\nKIRK: I don't know. I'll try and find out.\nMARTHA: Oh, Jim. How I'll miss him.

Jim Kirk.\nDAILY [OC]: Hi, Jim.\nKIRK: Can you do me a favour?\nDAILY [OC]: I owe you a dozen.

Anything else?\nKIRK: Just keep this between the two of us and accept my thanks. Over and out. Kirk to Enterprise.\nUHURA [OC]: Bridge here, Captain.\nKIRK: Transporter room, ready to beam up.\n\n[Bridge]\n\nSPOCK: Ready to resume course, Captain.\nKIRK: I think we're due for a pick-up.\nSPOCK: What kind? Personnel? Cargo?\nUHURA: Captain? A Miss Karidian has been transported aboard ship.

Captain, I'm afraid we need your help. We've been stranded. It seems that our transportation has cancelled out on us.\nKIRK: Can't you make other arrangements?\nLENORE: Yes, but not in time. You see, our schedule is like a chain. One break and it all collapses.\nKIRK: It'd be a shame if that happened.\nLENORE: If ever we needed a Good Samaritan.\nKIRK: Well.\nLENORE: I appeal to you.\n(Spock's eyebrow hits the ceiling)\nKIRK: The regulations are very clear about taking on passengers.\nLENORE: I'll make a bargain with you, Captain.\nKIRK: What have you got to trade?\nLENORE: Special performance for the crew in exchange for a lift.\nKIRK: You make it sound very interesting. The crew has been on patrol for a long time. They could use a break in the monotony.\nLENORE: Then you'll do it?\nKIRK: You've got me backed into a corner. The men would never forgive me if I deprived them of your performance, and your presence.\nLENORE: Thank you, Captain. I'm eternally grateful. I'll get the company ready. This means so much to them.\nKIRK: Mister Spock, prepare to leave orbit as soon as the Karidian company is aboard the ship.\n(Lenore and her escort enter the turbolift)\nSPOCK: May I inquire as to our course, Captain?\nKIRK: Benecia Colony.\nSPOCK: Benecia Colony is eight light years off our course.\nKIRK: If my memory needs refreshing, Mister Spock, I'll ask you for it. In the meantime, follow my orders.\n\nCaptain's log, stardate 2818.9. There are many questions in my mind, too many, perhaps, about the actor Karidian and his daughter. For personal reasons, I'm almost afraid to learn the answers.\n\n[Bridge]\n\nKIRK: Mister Spock, ETA the Benecia Colony.\nSPOCK: We'll arrive stardate 2825.3, Captain, approximately fifteen hundred Benecia time.\n(Kirk goes over to Spock's station and throws a few switches)\nCOMPUTER: Library computer.\nKIRK: Data on question submitted to personnel files.\nCOMPUTER: Data being received. Kodos file of all survivors. There are nine actual eye witnesses who can identify Kodos.\nKIRK: Stop. Give list.\nCOMPUTER: Kirk, J., presently Enterprise Captain, Leighton, T., Moulton, E., Riley, K., Eames, D.,\nKIRK: Stop. Is that star service Lieutenant Kevin Riley?\nCOMPUTER: Affirmative. Riley, Kevin. Presently assigned U.S.S. Enterprise communications section.\nKIRK: Stop. Mister Spock.\nSPOCK: Captain.\nKIRK: Lieutenant Kevin Riley in communications, I wish to have him transferred down to the engineering decks.\nSPOCK: He came up from engineering, Captain.\nKIRK: I'm sending him back.\nSPOCK: Any explanation? He's a fine young officer. He's bound to consider this transfer a disciplinary action.\nKIRK: I don't wish to discuss it, Mister Spock. Please follow my orders.\n\n[Sickbay]\n\nMCCOY: Mister Spock, the man on top walks a lonely street. The chain of command is often a noose.\nSPOCK: Spare me your philosophical metaphors, Doctor. The Captain is acting strangely. I'm asking if you've noticed.\nMCCOY: Negative. Did you know this is the first time in a week I've had time for a drop of the true? Would you care for a drink, Mister Spock?\nSPOCK: My father's race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol.\nMCCOY: Now I know why they were conquered. What are you so worried about, anyway? I find Jim generally knows what he's doing.\nKIRK: It was illogical for him to bring those players aboard.\nMCCOY: Illogical? Did you get a look at that Juliet? That's a pretty exciting creature. Of course your, personal chemistry would prevent you from seeing that. Did it ever occur to you that he simply might like the girl?\nSPOCK: It occurred. I dismissed it.\nMCCOY: You would.\nSPOCK: Did you know that he suddenly transferred Lieutenant Riley to engineering?\nMCCOY: Lots of things go on around here that I don't know, Mister Spock. Now, he's the Captain. He can transfer whoever he pleases. You can look that up in a hundred volumes of space regulations somewhere. All right? Come on, have a drink.\nSPOCK: No, thank you.\nMCCOY: You're welcome. But I will. And please, Mister Spock, if you won't join me, don't disapprove of me. At least not until you've tried it, huh?\n\n[Observation deck]\n\n(Lenore is getting a personal tour of the ship)\nKIRK: This is the observation deck. That's the flight deck down there with the shuttle craft.\nLENORE: Interesting.\nKIRK: Isn't it?\nLENORE: Tell me, Captain Kirk.\nKIRK: Anything.\nLENORE: Did you order the soft lights especially for the occasion?\nKIRK: If I had ordered soft lights, I'd also have arranged for music and flowers. Unfortunately, it isn't so. On the Enterprise, we try to duplicate earth conditions of night and day as closely as possible.\nLENORE: Star light, star bright. I wish I may, I wish I might. Do you remember that, Captain?\nKIRK: It's very old.\nLENORE: Almost as old as the stars themselves. And this ship. All this power, surging and throbbing, yet under control. Are you like that, Captain? All this power at your command, yet the decisions that you have to make\nKIRK: Come from a very human source.\nLENORE: Are you, Captain? Human?\nKIRK: You can count on it.\nLENORE: Tell me about the women in your world, Captain.\nKIRK: I'd rather talk about you. You must have wanted to perform since you first saw your father act. When was that?\nLENORE: In the beginning.\nKIRK: Tell me about it.\nLENORE: That's not fair. You haven't answered my question about the women.\nKIRK: What would you like to know?\nLENORE: Has the machine changed them? Made them just people instead of women?\nKIRK: Worlds may change, galaxies disintegrate, but a woman always remains a woman.\nLENORE: All this and power too. The Caesar of the stars and the Cleopatra to worship him.\n(Finally, a passionate embrace)\n\n[Bridge]\n\n(Spock is on duty, and thinking)\nCOMPUTER: Library computer.\nSPOCK: Full personal dossiers on the following names. Doctor Thomas Leighton, Anton Karidian, Lieutenant Kevin Riley, and Captain James T. Kirk.\nCOMPUTER: Accomplished. Standing by.\nSPOCK: Correlate. Check their past histories. Report any item, any past episode or experience they all have in common.\nCOMPUTER: Affirmative.\n\n[Corridor]\n\nMCCOY: I appreciate whatever concern you may have for the ship's company, Mister Spock,\nSPOCK: I will continue, Doctor. According to our library banks, it started on the Earth colony of Tarsus Four, when the food supply was attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed. There were over eight thousand colonists and virtually no food. And that was when Governor Kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law.\nMCCOY: I've heard of it.\nSPOCK: You may not have heard it all. Kodos began to separate the colonists. Some would live, be rationed whatever food was left. The remainder would be immediately put to death. Apparently he had his own theories of eugenics.\nMCCOY: Unfortunately, he wasn't the first.\nSPOCK: Perhaps not. But he was certainly among the most ruthless, to decide arbitrarily who would survive and who would not, using his own personal standards, and then to implement his decision without mercy. Children watching their parents die. Whole families destroyed. Over four thousand people. They died quickly, without pain, but they died. Relief arrived, but too late to prevent the executions. And Kodos? There never was a positive identification of his body.\nMCCOY: What has Karidian to do with it?\nSPOCK: His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared.\nMCCOY: You think Jim suspects he's Kodos?\nSPOCK: He'd better. There were nine eye witnesses who survived the massacre, who'd actually seen Kodos with their own eyes. Jim Kirk was one of them. With the exception of Riley and Captain Kirk, every other eye witness is dead. And my library computer shows that wherever they were, on Earth, on a colony, or aboard ship, the Karidian Company of Players was somewhere near when they died.\nMCCOY: It's unbelievable.\n\n[Engineering]\n\n(There's just one officer on duty, and he hasn't touched the meal lying on a plate nearby)\nRILEY: Hey. Rec room. Somebody.\n\n[Rec room]\n\nRILEY [OC]: Talk to me.\nMATSON: Larry Matson here. Is that you, Riley?\n\n[Engineering]\n\nMATSON [OC]: What's up?\nRILEY: Not me. I am down. In the engineering room.\nMATSON [OC]: You've been a bad boy.\nRILEY: Maybe so. Whatever I've done, they're sure keeping it a secret from me.\n\n[Rec room]\n\nRILEY [OC]: Hey. Is that Uhura playing? Let me talk to her.\nMATSON: I think his heart is sore.\nUHURA: What can I do for you, Riley?\n\n[Engineering]\n\nRILEY: A song. Make it a love song. Just something to reassure me I'm not the only living thing left in the universe, huh?\n\n[Rec room]\n\nUHURA: Well, you're not, and I'll prove it to you.\n(sings) The skies are green and glowing\n\n[Engineering]\n\nUHURA [OC]: Where my heart is\nWhere my heart is\nWhere the scented lunar flower is growing\nSomewhere beyond the stars\nBeyond Antares.\n(As Riley listens, we see a shadow moving)\n\n[Rec room]\n\nUHURA: I'll be back, though it takes forever\nForever is just a day\nForever is just another journey\n\n{Engineering]\n\nUHURA [OC]: Tomorrow a stop along the way\n(Something gets squirted into Riley's milk)\nUHURA [OC]: Then let the years go fading\n\n[Rec room]\n\nUHURA: Where my heart is\n\n[Engineering]\n\n(Riley reaches for his tray)\nUHURA [OC]: Where my heart is\nWhere my love eternal is waiting'\nSomewhere beyond the stars\nBeyond Antares.\n(He drinks)\n\n[Rec room]\n\nUHURA: How'd you like that, Riley?\n\n[Engineering]\n\n(But Riley is sweating and choking)\nRILEY: Help me, please.\n(He collapses)\n\n[Sickbay]\n\nSPOCK: You've got to pull him through.\nMCCOY: I'm not sure I can.\nSPOCK: If he dies, the only one who'll be able to identify Kodos is the Captain. And he'll be the next target.\n\nCaptain's log, stardate 2819.1. Ship's officer Riley's condition worsening. Doctor McCoy making lab analysis to determine cause and antidote. Entire crew deeply concerned.\n\n[McCoy's office]\n\nMCCOY: As of this date, lab report indicates presence of appreciable amount of tetralubisol, a highly volatile lubricant in use aboard ship.\nSPOCK: Someone tried to poison him.\nMCCOY: Tetralubisol us a milky substance. Someone could have gotten careless, made a mistake.\nSPOCK: I don't believe that and neither do you. I want the Captain to see that report.\nMCCOY: When I've finished logging it.\nSPOCK: Now.\n\n[Captain's quarters]\n\nKIRK: Come.\nMCCOY: My report on Lieutenant Riley.\nKIRK: Will he make it?\nMCCOY: He's got a good chance.\nSPOCK: Can we predict the same for you, Captain?\nKIRK: All right, Mister Spock. Let's have it.\nSPOCK: Lieutenant Riley was a witness. So were you.\nKIRK: All right.\nSPOCK: Someone tried to kill him.\nMCCOY: Could have been an accident.\nSPOCK: You should be told the difference between empiricism and stubbornness, Doctor. I checked with the library computer, just as you did. I got the same information.\nKIRK: Aren't you getting a little out of line, Mister Spock? My personal business,\nSPOCK: Is my personal business when it might interfere with the smooth operation of this ship.\nKIRK: You think that happened?\nSPOCK: It could happen.\nKIRK: I don't like anyone meddling in my private affairs. Not even my second in command.\nMCCOY: Jim, Spock's simply trying,\nKIRK: I know what he's doing, and I don't like it.\nMCCOY: It's his job, and you know it.\nKIRK: And you also know that nothing is proven.\nSPOCK: Even in this corner of the galaxy, Captain, two plus two equals four. Almost certainly an attempt will be made to kill you. Why do you invite death?\nKIRK: I'm not. I'm interested in justice.\nMCCOY: Are you? Are you sure it's not vengeance?\nKIRK: No, I'm not sure. I wish I was. I've done things I've never done before. I've placed my command in jeopardy. From here on I've got to determine whether or not Karidian is Kodos.\nSPOCK: He is.\nKIRK: You sound certain. I wish I could be. Before I accuse a man of that, I've got to be. I saw him once, twenty years ago. Men change. Memory changes. Look at him now, he's an actor. He can change his appearance. No. Logic is not enough. I've got to feel my way, make absolutely sure.\nMCCOY: What if you decide he is Kodos? What then? Do you play God, carry his head through the corridors in triumph? That won't bring back the dead, Jim.\nKIRK: No, but they may rest easier.\n(A scene break, during which McCoy apparently leaves)\nSPOCK: Logic, Captain. Doctor Leighton was murdered while the Karidian Company was on Planet Q. Now an attempt has been made against Riley while the company is on board the Enterprise.\nKIRK: Doc isn't sure it was a murder attempt. Besides, I have an idea may prove\nSPOCK: Shh. Listen. Do you hear it? That low hum.\nKIRK: A phaser.\nSPOCK: On overload. (starts searching)\nKIRK: This is the Captain. There's a phaser on overload in my quarters. If it blows, it'll take out the entire deck. Evacuate all personnel in this quadrant. Double Red Alert. (now starts searching himself) You get out of here.\nSPOCK: You can't stay.\nKIRK: Go on. Block off this section. Hurry. I'll find it.\n\n[Corridor]\n\nSPOCK: Evacuate this section. Seal it off. Clear section C4 and C5.\n(In Kirk's quarters the noise gets louder, and finally he sees the phaser silhouetted against the Red Alert light high in a bulkhead. He gets it, dashes into the corridor and drops it into a convenient pressure waste disposal unit directly opposite. Spock returns in time for the bang that throws them against the opposite wall)\n\n[Karidian's quarters]\n\nKIRK: (barging in without knocking) We're overdue for our talk, aren't we?\nKARIDIAN: I hoped you would have respected my privacy, Captain.\nKIRK: A moment ago, we narrowly averted an explosion which would have destroyed several decks of this ship. Before that, someone tried to poison one of my crewmen.\nKARIDIAN: I am sorry to hear that.\nKIRK: I'm sure you are. Are you Kodos? I asked you a question.\nKARIDIAN: Do you believe that I am?\nKIRK: I do.\nKARIDIAN: Then I am Kodos, if it pleases you to believe so. I am an actor. I play many parts.\nKIRK: You're an actor now. What were you twenty years ago?\nKARIDIAN: Younger, Captain. Much younger.\nKIRK: So was I. But I remember. Let's see if you do. Read this into that communicator on the wall. It will be recorded and compared to a piece of Kodos' voice film we have in our files. The test is virtually infallible. It will tell us whether you're Karidian, or Kodos the Executioner. (switches on comm.) Ready for voice test. Disguising your voice will make no difference.\nKARIDIAN: (reading) The revolution is successful, but survival depends on drastic measures. Your continued existence represents a threat to the well-being of society. (stops looking at the paper) Your lives means slow death to the more valued members of the colony. Therefore I have no alternative but to sentence you to death. Your execution is so ordered. Signed, Kodos, governor of Tarsus Four.\nKIRK: I remember the words. I wrote them down. You said them like you knew them. You hardly glanced at the paper.\nKARIDIAN: I learn my parts very quickly.\nKIRK: Are you sure? Are you sure you didn't act this role out in front of a captive audience whom you blasted out of existence without mercy?\nKARIDIAN: I find your use of the word mercy strangely inappropriate, Captain. Here you stand, the perfect symbol of our technical society. Mechanised, electronicised, and not very human. You've done away with humanity, the striving of man to achieve greatness through his own resources.\nKIRK: We've armed man with tools. The striving for greatness continues. But Kodos\nKARIDIAN: Kodos, whoever he was\nKIRK: Or is.\nKARIDIAN: Or is. Kodos made a decision of life and death. Some had to die that others might live. You're a man of decision, Captain. You ought to understand that.\nKIRK: All I understand is that four thousand people were needlessly butchered.\nKARIDIAN: In order to save four thousand others. And if the supply ships hadn't come earlier than expected, this Kodos of yours might have gone down in history as a great hero.\nKIRK: But he didn't. And history has made its judgment.\nKARIDIAN: If you're so sure that I'm Kodos, why not kill me now? Let bloody vengeance take its final course! And see what difference it makes to this universe of yours.\nKIRK: Those beautiful words, well acted, change nothing.\nKARIDIAN: I suppose not. They're merely tools, like this ship of yours.\nKIRK: There are no previous records to Anton Karidian prior to twenty years ago.\nKARIDIAN: Blood thins. The body fails. One is finally grateful for a failing memory. I no longer treasure life, not even my own. I am tired! And the past is a blank. Did you get everything you, wanted, Captain Kirk?\nKIRK: If I had gotten everything I wanted, you might not walk out of this room alive.\nLENORE: Captain Kirk.\n(She enters from the next room)\nLENORE: (to Karidian) You'd better rest now. There's a stain of cruelty on your shining armour, Captain. You could have spared him, and me. You talked of using tools. I was a tool, wasn't l? A tool to use against my father.\nKIRK: In the beginning perhaps. But later, I wanted it to be more than that.\nLENORE: Later. Everything's always later. Later. Latest. Too late. Too late, Captain. You are like your ship, powerful, and not human. There is no mercy in you.\nKIRK: If he is Kodos, then I've shown him more mercy than he deserves. And if he isn't, then we'll let you off at Benecia, and no harm done.\nLENORE: Captain Kirk. Who are you to say what harm was done?\nKIRK: Who do I have to be?\n\n[Sickbay]\n\n(Kevin is pacing up and down in the background, overhearing what is being dictated)\nMCCOY: Medical log. Lieutenant Riley's sufficiently recovered to be discharged, but the Captain's ordered him restricted to Sickbay to prevent contact with the passenger who calls himself Karidian and who's suspected of being Kodos the Executioner and of murdering the Lieutenant's family.\n\nCaptain's log, stardate 2819.8. Suspect under surveillance. Strategic areas under double guard. Performance of the Karidian Players taking place as scheduled.\n\n[Ship's Theatre]\n\nLENORE: (on stage) Tonight, the Karidian Players present Hamlet, another in a series of living plays presented in space, dedicated to the tradition of classic theatre. Hamlet is a violent play about violent times when life was cheap and ambition was God.\n\n[Kirk's quarters]\n\n(Two pieces of paper are lined up on his desk)\nSPOCK: I believe we have a match, Captain.\nKIRK: But not an exact match, Mister Spock. We're dealing with a man's life. No machine can make that decision.\n\n[Sickbay]\n\nMCCOY: In the long history of medicine, no doctor has ever caught the first few minutes of a play. Riley, don't forget to\n(but he's not there)\nMCCOY: Riley? Captain Kirk, McCoy here.\nKIRK [OC]: Yes, Doctor.\nMCCOY: Riley's gone. I was recording my log about Karidian and Kodos. If he overheard\n\n[Kirk's quarters]\n\nKIRK: You've made your point, Doctor.\nSECURITY [OC]: Captain? Security, H deck, The weapons locker has been broken into. One phaser is missing.\nKIRK: This is the Captain. Security two alert. Find and restrain Lieutenant Kevin Riley. He's armed and possibly headed towards the ship's theatre.\n\n[Ship's Theatre]\n\n(The Ghost summons Hamlet)\nHAMLET: Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I'll go no further.\nKARIDIAN Mark me.\nHAMLET: I will.\n(Kirk comes creeping around backstage)\nKARIDIAN: My hour is almost come, when I to sulphurous and tormenting fires must render up myself.\nHAMLET: Speak. I am bound to hear.\nKARIDIAN: So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear. I am thy father's spirit, doomed for a certain term to walk the night,\n(Kirk spots Kevin with the phaser)\nKIRK: Riley, get back to the Sickbay.\nRILEY: He murdered my father, and my mother.\nKIRK: You could be wrong. Don't throw away your life on a mistake.\nRILEY: I'm not wrong.\nKARIDIAN: But that I am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house,\nRILEY: I know that voice, that face, I know it. I saw it. He murdered them.\nKARIDIAN: Thy soul, freeze thy young blood.\nKIRK: It's an order. Give me the weapon.\n(Takes it from Riley)\nKIRK: Now get back to Sickbay. Go on.\n(Riley leaves, and there is polite applause at the end of the scene on stage. Karidian comes backstage.)\nLENORE: It's going beautifully. What is it? What's wrong?\nKARIDIAN: There was a voice out of the past haunting me, torturing me. There was another part I once played long ago. I never told you about it. Now that same curtain rises again. The time has come.\nLENORE: No, Father. The time will never come. Tonight, after my performance, the last two who can harm you will be gone.\nKARIDIAN: What are you saying?\nLENORE: There were nine. Now there are only two, and they will be gone as soon as I. Don't look at me like that.\nKARIDIAN: What have you done?\nLENORE: What had to be done. They had to be silenced.\nKARIDIAN: All of them? All seven? More blood on my hands?\nLENORE: No Father, not anymore. I'm strong, Father. It's nothing.\nSTAGEHAND [OC]: Second act, three minutes.\nLENORE: We'll be ready. Don't you see? All the ghosts are dead. I've buried them. There's no more blood on your hands.\nKARIDIAN: Oh, my child, my child. You've left me nothing! You were the one thing in my life untouched by what I'd done.\nLENORE: But you're safe now, Father. I've saved you. Now, no one can touch you. Not even Captain Kirk. See Caesar come? He's awed by your greatness, your shining brightness. Bright as a blade before it is stained with blood.\nKIRK: Bright as a blade. Come with me, both of you.\nLENORE: Of course. After the play.\nKIRK: The play is over. It's been over for twenty years.\nKARIDIAN: I was a soldier in a cause. There were things to be done, terrible things.\nLENORE: Stop it, Father! You have nothing to justify.\nKARIDIAN: Murder, flight, suicide, madness. I never wanted the blood on my hands ever to stain you.\nLENORE: I did it for you. I've saved you.\nKIRK: By killing seven innocent men.\nLENORE: They weren't innocent! They were dangerous! I would have killed a world to save him!\nSTAGEHAND [OC]: Curtain going up, one minute.\n(Kirk takes Karidian's arm)\nLENORE: The play, Captain. He must go on. This is the great Karidian.\nKIRK: Guard.\nLENORE: You cannot deny him his last performance!\n(She grabs the security guard's phaser and runs out onto the stage)\nKARIDIAN: Lenore, don't!\nKIRK: You'll never get off the ship.\nLENORE: It will become a floating tomb, drifting through space with the soul of the great Karidian giving performances at every star he touches. (Kirk moves towards her) I know how to use this, Captain.\nKARIDIAN: No.\nLENORE: Caesar, beware the ides of March.\nKARIDIAN: No, child! Don't!\n(As she squeezes the trigger, her father steps in front of Kirk, and takes the shot himself. Lenore screams at what she has done. and Kirk takes the phaser from her as she kneels over Karidian's body)\nLENORE: Father. Father! O, proud, death! What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, that thou, such a prince at a shot so bloodily hast struck? The curtain, the curtain rises. It rises. There's no time to sleep. The play. The play. The play's the thing, wherein we'll catch the conscience of the king.\n\n[Bridge]\n\nMCCOY: Medical report. (hands it over) She'll receive the best of care, Jim. She remembers nothing. She even thinks her father's still alive giving performances before cheering crowds. You really cared for her, didn't you?\nSPOCK: Ready to leave Benecia orbit, Captain.\nKIRK: Stand by, Mister Leslie. All channels cleared, Uhura?\nUHURA: All channels clear, sir.\nKIRK: Whenever you're ready, Mister Leslie.\nLESLIE: Leaving orbit, sir.\nMCCOY: You're not going to answer my question, are you?\nKIRK: Ahead warp factor one, Mister Leslie.\nMCCOY: That's an answer.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/157375", "artist_names": "Margaret Cho", "full_title": "Michelle Shocked Me by\u00a0Margaret\u00a0Cho", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/fdc0dc0867f7cda195c95258808d754b.300x199x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fdc0dc0867f7cda195c95258808d754b.620x412x1.jpg", "id": 157375, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 7, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": null, "path": "/Margaret-cho-michelle-shocked-me-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Margaret-cho-michelle-shocked-me-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/fdc0dc0867f7cda195c95258808d754b.300x199x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fdc0dc0867f7cda195c95258808d754b.620x412x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Michelle Shocked Me", "title_with_featured": "Michelle Shocked Me", "updated_by_human_at": 1369858314, "url": "https://genius.com/Margaret-cho-michelle-shocked-me-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/52719", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fdc0dc0867f7cda195c95258808d754b.620x412x1.jpg", "id": 52719, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fdc0dc0867f7cda195c95258808d754b.620x412x1.jpg", "index_character": "m", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Margaret Cho", "slug": "Margaret-cho", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Margaret-cho", "iq": 100}, "artist": "Margaret Cho", "lyrics": "Michelle Shocked Me LyricsWell, Michelle Shocked, I am actually totally shocked. What the hell? It's freaky to me, the whole business of going from a queer icon to someone who would actually say that God hates us. When the shock wore off, I found that people were super angry, but I just got scared. I think that as a queer person of color, I have been scared my entire life. I get over it bit by bit, enough to get by and live, but then something like this happens, and it's like getting gay bashed all over again.\n\nWhen people say that God hates fags, there's this idea that it's OK to kill us, that it doesn't matter if we die, because if God -- the supposedly loving force in the world, the one who is supposed to love everyone and everything, the one, the only, whatever, whenever -- hates us, then how are we to exist? But if he hates us, why did he make so many of us?\n\nWhen someone like Michelle Shocked, formerly a beloved, alt queer muse and maker of the '90s, decides that it is OK to hate us and lets us know that God does too, I am truly sickened, as she of all people should know what this means.\n\nI made many mixtapes with that song \"Anchorage,\" which I always regarded as a lesbian anthem. It was the song playing on the eight-track cassette converter in the big, old, gas-guzzling behemoth of a Buick that I used to peel out of a dirt parking lot behind a country roadhouse, with tall corn and grass on all sides, to get away from a scary dude who had suddenly appeared out of the dark shadows of the cornfield, wielding nunchucks -- or it might have been a belt with a heavy buckle, or maybe a tire iron. Fear clouds my memory, because when you are just a teenager and are being chased in the middle of the night by a crazy man calling you and your girlfriend \"fucking dykes\" while whipping something around, knocking the \"ick\" off the \"Buick\" on the back of your car, it's hard to pay attention to precisely what is in his hands, because you are not looking at him; you are looking to get away. I didn't turn back; I kept going, maybe to keep this girl safe (I might be butch after all), but probably because I was too scared to turn back.\n\nIf you ever are terrorized like this, run. Don't look back. Don't be a hero. It's not like the movies. Just get out of there. Hatred and homophobia can never be underestimated. And the effect of someone saying \"God hates fags\" can never be underestimated either. It's a license to kill. It's a death sentence. It's not funny. It's not OK. It's not something I can let go easily, because I know what it truly means.\n\nThe violence and hopelessness behind the statement keeps me up at night and will haunt me just like the tragic memory of a young gay man who was murdered in front of my family's bookstore in the '70s. He was beaten to death because some men (who were never caught, let alone punished) believed that God hated him. In my nightmares I find his teeth all over the ground, and I try to save them, and they keep falling out of my hands and pockets, and then I realize that he is dead and has no use for them anymore,

Emergency Medicine confirms it: Each year, between one and two dozen adult US males are admitted to ERs after having castrated themselves. With kitchen tools, usually, sometimes wire cutters. In answer to the obvious question, surviving patients most often report that their sexual urges had become a source of intolerable conflict and anxiety. The desire for perfect release and the real-world impossibility of perfect, whenever-you-want-it release had together produced a tension they could no longer stand.\n\nIt is to the 30+ testosteronically afflicted males whose cases have been documented in the past two years that your correspondents wish to dedicate this article. And to those tormented souls considering autocastration in 1998, we wish to say: \u201cStop! Stay your hand! Hold off with those kitchen utensils and/or wire cutters!\u201d Because we believe we may have found an alternative.\n\nEvery spring, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents awards for outstanding achievement in all aspects of mainstream cinema. These are the Academy Awards. Mainstream cinema is a major industry in the United States, and so are the Academy Awards. The AAs\u2019 notorious commercialism and hypocrisy disgust many of the millions and millions and millions of viewers who tune in during prime time to watch the presentations. It is not a coincidence that the Oscars ceremony is held during TV\u2019s Sweeps Week. We pretty much all tune in, despite the grotesquerie of watching an industry congratulate itself on its pretense that it\u2019s still an art form, of hearing people in $5,000 gowns invoke lush clich\u00e9s of surprise and humility scripted by publicists, etc.\u2014the whole cynical postmodern deal\u2014but we all still seem to watch. To care. Even though the hypocrisy hurts, even though opening grosses and marketing strategies are now bigger news than the movies themselves, even though Cannes and Sundance have become nothing more than enterprise zones. But the truth is that there\u2019s no more real joy about it all anymore. Worse, there seems to be this enormous unspoken conspiracy where we all pretend that there\u2019s still joy. That we think it\u2019s funny when Bob Dole does a Visa ad and Gorbachev shills for Pizza Hut. That the whole mainstream celebrity culture is rushing to cash in and all the while congratulating itself on pretending not to cash in. Underneath it all, though, we know the whole thing sucks.\n\nYour correspondents humbly offer an alternative.\n\nEvery January, the least pretentious city in America hosts the Annual AVN Awards. The AVN stands for Adult Video News, which is sort of the Variety of the US porn industry. This thick, beautifully designed magazine costs $7.95 per issue, is about 80 percent ads, and is clearly targeted at adult-video retailers. Its circulation is appr. 40,000.\n\nThough the sub-line vagaries of entertainment accounting are legendary, it is universally acknowledged that the US adult-film industry, at $3.5-4 billion in annual sales, rentals, cable charges, and video-masturbation-booth revenues, is an even larger and more efficient moneymaking machine than legitimate mainstream American cinema (the latter\u2019s annual gross commonly estimated at $2-2.5 billion). The US adult industry is centered in LA\u2019s San Fernando Valley, just over the mountains from Hollywood.1 Some insiders like to refer to the adult industry as Hollywood\u2019s Evil Twin, others as the mainstream\u2019s Big Red Son.\nIt is no accident that Adult Video News\u2014a slick, expensive periodical whose articles are really more like infomercials\u2014and its yearly Awards both came into being in 1982. The early \u201980s, after all, saw the genesis of VCRs and home-video rentals, which have done for the adult industry pretty much what TV did for pro football.\n\nFrom the 12/11/97 press release issued by AVN (visitable also at www.avn.com):\n\n- The nominations for the 15th Annual AVN Awards were announced today.2 This year\u2019s awards show, commemorating AVN\u2019s 15th anniversary, celebrates \u201cHistory\u201d. [sic]\n\n- Awards will be presented in a record 106 categories over a two night period.\n\n- The adult industry released nearly 8,000 adult releases [sic] in 1997, including over 4,000 \u201cnew\u201d releases (non-compilation). AVN reviewed every new release in every categroy [sic] this past year, logging over 30,000 sex scenes.3\n\n- By comparison, last year there were approximately 375 films eligible for the Academy Awards that these voters [sic\u2014meaning different voters from the AVN voters, presumably] were required to see. AVN had to watch more than 10 times the amount of releases in order to develop these nominations [usage and repetition sic, though 4,000 divided by 375 is indeed over 10].\n\nFrom the acceptance speech of Mr. Tom Byron, Saturday, 10 January 1998, Caesars Forum ballroom, Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino complex, Las Vegas NV, upon winning AVN\u2019s 1998 Male Performer of the Year Award (and with no little feeling): \u201cI want to thank every beautiful woman I ever put my cock inside.\u201d [Laughter, cheers, ovation.]\nFrom the acceptance speech of Ms. Jeanna Fine, ibid., upon winning AVN\u2019s 1998 Best Supporting Actress Award for her role in Rob Black\u2019s Miscreants: \u201cJesus, which one is this for, Miscreants? Jesus, that\u2019s another one where I read the script and said \u2018Oh shit, I am going to go to hell. [Laughter, cheers.] But that\u2019s okay, \u2019cause all my friends\u2019ll be there too!\u201d [Huge wave of laughter, cheers, applause.]\n\nFrom the inter-Award banter of Mr. Bobby Slayton, professional comedian and master of ceremonies for the 1997 AVNAs: \u201cI know I\u2019m looking good, though, like younger, \u2019cause I started using this special Grecian Formula\u2014every time I find a gray hair, I fuck my wife in the ass. [No laughter, scattered groans.] Fuck you. That\u2019s a great joke. Fuck you.\u201d\n\nBobby Slayton, a gravelly-voiced Dice Clay knockoff who kept introducing every female performer as \u201cthe woman I\u2019m going to cut my dick off for,\u201d and who astounded all the marginal print journalists in attendance with both his unfunniness and his resemblance to every apartment-complex coke dealer we\u2019d ever met, is mercifully absent from the 1998 Awards gala. The \u201998 emcee is one Robert Schimmel, alumnus of In Living Color and a Howard Stern regular. Schimmel looks like a depraved, deeply tan Wallace Shawn and is no less coarse than B. Slayton but a lot better. He does a pantomime of someone attempting intercourse with a Love Doll he\u2019s been too lazy to blow up all the way. He contrasts the woeful paucity of his own ejaculate with the concussive orgasms of certain well-known male performers,4 comparing these men\u2019s ejaculations to automatic lawn sprinklers and doing an eerie sonic impression of same. All of 1998\u2019s marginal print journalists are together at Table 189 at the very back of the ballroom. Most of these reporters are from the sorts of men\u2019s magazines that sit shrinkwrapped behind the cash registers of convenience stores, and they are a worldly and jaded crew indeed, but Schimmel gets a couple of them\u2014whose noms de guerre are Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth\u2014laughing so uproariously that people at the Anabolic Video table nearby keep looking over in annoyance. At one point during a routine on premature ejaculation, Dick Filth actually chokes on a California roll.\n\n\u2026 But all this is Saturday night, the main event. And there are a whole lot of festivities preceding Saturday\u2019s climax.\n\nThe adult industry is vulgar. Would anyone disagree? One of the AVN Awards\u2019 categories is \u201cBest Anal Themed Feature\u201d; another is \u201cBest Overall Marketing Campaign\u2014Company Image.\u201d Irresistible, a 1983 winner in several categories, has been spelled Irresistable in Adult Video News for fifteen straight years. The industry\u2019s not only vulgar, it\u2019s predictably vulgar. All the clich\u00e9s are true. The typical porn producer really is the ugly little man with a bad toupee and a pinkie-ring the size of a Rolaids. The typical porn director really is the guy who uses the word class as a noun to mean refinement. The typical porn starlet really is the lady in Lycra eveningwear with tattoos all down her arms who\u2019s both smoking and chewing gum while telling journalists how grateful she is to Wadcutter Productions Ltd. for footing her breast-enlargement bill. And meaning it. The whole AVN Awards weekend comprises what Mr. Dick Filth calls an Irony-Free Zone.\nBut of course we should keep in mind that vulgar has many dictionary definitions and that only a couple of these have to do w/ lewdness or bad taste. At root, vulgar just means popular on a mass scale. It is the semantic opposite of pretentious or snobby. It is humility with a comb-over. It is Nielsen ratings and Barnum\u2019s axiom and the real bottom line. It is big, big business.\nThirty-four-year-old porn actor Cal Jammer killed himself in 1995. Starlets Shauna Grant, Nancy Kelly, Alex Jordan, and Savannah have all killed themselves in the last decade. Savannah and Jordan received AVN\u2019s Best New Starlet awards in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Savannah killed herself after getting mildly disfigured in a car accident. Alex Jordan is famous for having addressed her suicide note to her pet bird. Crewman and performer Israel Gonzalez killed himself at a porn company warehouse in 1997.\n\nAn LA-based support group called PAW (=Protecting Adult Welfare) runs a 24-hour crisis line for people in the adult industry. A fundraiser for PAW was held at a Mission Hills CA bowling alley last November. It was a nude bowling tournament. Dozens of starlets agreed to take part. Two or three hundred adult-video fans showed up and paid to watch them bowl naked. No production companies or their executives participated or gave money. The fundraiser took in $6,000, which is slightly less than two one-millionths of porn\u2019s yearly gross.\n\nAs you know if you\u2019ve seen Casino, Showgirls, Bugsy, etc., there are really three Las Vegases. Binion\u2019s, where the World Series of Poker is always played, exemplifies the \u201cOld Vegas,\u201d centered around Fremont Street. Las Vegas\u2019s future is even now under late-stage construction at the very end of the Strip, on the outskirts of town (where US malls always go up); it\u2019s to be a bunch of theme-parkish, more \u201cfamily-oriented\u201d venues of the kind that De Niro describes so plangently at the end of Casino.\n\nBut Las Vegas as most of us see it, Vegas qua Vegas, comprises the dozen or so hotels that flank the Strip\u2019s middle. Vegas Populi: the opulent, intricate, garish, ecstatically decadent hotels, cathedra to gambling, partying, and live entertainment of the most microphone- swinging sort. The Sands. The Sahara. The Stardust. MGM Grand, Maxim. All within a small radius. Yearly utility expenditures on neon well into seven figures. Harrah\u2019s, Casino Royale (with its big 24-hour Denny\u2019s attached), Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace. The Mirage, with its huge laddered waterfall always lit up. Circus Circus. Treasure Island, with its intricate facade of decks and rigging and mizzens and vang. The Luxor, shaped like a ziggurat from Babylon of yore. Barbary Coast, whose sign out front says CASH YOUR PAYCHECK\u2014WIN UP TO $25,000. These hotels are the Vegas we know. The land of Lola and Wayne. Of Siegfried and Roy, Copperfield. Showgirls in towering headdress. Sinatra\u2019s sandbox. Most of them built in the \u201950s and \u201960s, the era of mob chic and entertainment-cum-industry. Half-hour lines for taxis. Smoking not just allowed but encouraged. Toupees and convention nametags and women in furs of all hue. A museum that features the World\u2019s Biggest Coke Bottle. The Harley-Davidson Cafe, with its tympanum of huge protruding hawg; Bally\u2019s H&C, with its row of phallic pillars all electrified and blinking in grand mal sync. A city that pretends to be nothing but what it is, an enormous machine of exchange\u2014of spectacle for money, of sensation for money, of money for more money, of pleasure for whatever be tomorrow\u2019s abstract cost.\n\nNor let us forget Vegas\u2019s synecdoche and beating heart. It\u2019s kittycorner from Bally\u2019s: Caesars Palace. The granddaddy. As big as 20 Wal-Marts end to end. Real marble and fake marble, carpeting you can pass out on without contusion, 130,000 square feet of casino alone. Domed ceilings, clerestories, barrel vaults. In Caesars Palace is America conceived as a new kind of Rome: conqueror of its own people. An empire of Self. It\u2019s breathtaking. The winter\u2019s light rain makes all the neon bleed. The whole thing is almost too pretty to stand. There could be no site but Las Vegas\u2019s Caesars for modern porn\u2019s Awards show\u2014here, the AAVNAs are one more spectacle. Way more tourists and conventioneers recognize the starlets than you\u2019d expect. Double-takes all over the hotel. Even just standing around or putting coins in a slot machine, the performers become a prime attraction. Las Vegas doesn\u2019t miss a trick.\n\nThe Annual AVN Awards are always scheduled to coincide with the International Consumer Electronics Show (a.k.a. CES), which this year runs from 8 through 11 January. The CES is a very big deal. It\u2019s like a combination convention and talent show for the best and brightest in the world of consumer tech. Steve Forbes is here, and DSS\u2019s Thomson. Sun Microsystems is using this year\u2019s CES to launch its PersonalJava 1.0. Bill Gates gives a packed-house speech on Saturday morning. Major players from TV, cable, and merchandising host a panel on the short-term viability of HDTV. A forum on the problem of product returns by disgruntled customers seats 1,500 and is SRO. The CES as a whole is bigger than your correspondents\u2019 hometowns. It\u2019s spread out over four different hotels and has 10,000+ booths with everything from \u201cThe First Ever Full Text Message Pager in a Wristwatch\u201d to the world\u2019s premier self-heating home satellite dish (\u201cThe Snow and Ice Solution!\u201d).\n\nBut far and away the CES\u2019s most popular venue, with total attendance well over 100,000 every year, is what is called the Adult Software5 exhibition, despite the fact that the CES itself treats the Adult tradeshow kind of like the crazy relative in the family and keeps it way out in what used to be the parking garage of the Sands hotel. This facility, a serious bus ride from all the other CES sites, is an enormous windowless all-cement space that during show hours manages to induce both agoraphobia and claustrophobia. A big sign says you have to be 21 to get in. The median age inside is 45, almost all males, nearly everyone wearing some sort of conventioneer\u2019s nametag. Every production company in the adult industry, from Anabolic to Zane, has a booth here. The really big companies have booths that are sprawling and multidisplay and more like small strip malls. A lot of porn\u2019s top female performers are contract players, exclusive vendors to one particular production company; and one reason why a lot of the starlets seem kind of tired and cranky by Saturday night\u2019s Awards gala is that they will have spent much of the previous 72 hours at their companies\u2019 CES booths, on their feet all day in vertiginous heels, signing autographs and posing for pictures and pressing all manner of flesh.\n\nThe best way to describe the sonic environment at the \u201998 CES is: Imagine that the apocalypse took the form of a cocktail party. Male fans move through the fractal maze of booths in groups of three or more. Their expressions tend to be those of junior-high boys at a peephole, an expression that looks pretty surreal on a face with jowls and no hairline. Some among them are video retailers; most are not. Most are just hard-core fans, the industry\u2019s breath and bread. A lot of them not only recognize but seem to know the names, stage names, and curricula vitae of almost all the female performers.\n\nIt takes an average of two hours and twelve minutes to traverse the Adult CES expo, counting an average of four delays for getting lost after a chicane turn or some baroque ceiling-high cheval glass designed to double the visual exposure of Heatwave Video\u2019s display for Texas Dildo Masquerade gets you all turned around. Your correspondents are accompanied by Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, who have very generously offered to act as guides and docents, and here is a random spatter of the things we see the first time we come in:\n\nA second-tier Arrow Video starlet in a G-string poses for a photo, forked dorsally over the knee of a morbidly obese cellphone retailer from suburban Philadelphia. The guy taking the picture, whose CES nametag says Hi and that his name is Sherm, addresses the starlet as \u201cbabe\u201d and asks her to readjust so as to \u201cgive us a little more bush down there.\u201d An Elegant Angel starlet with polyresin wings attached to her back is eating a Milky Way bar while she signs video boxes. Actor Steven St. Croix is standing near the Caballero Home Video booth, saying to no one in particular \u201cLet me out of here, I can\u2019t wait to get out of here.\u201d6 Adult-video stores all have a distinctive smell\u2014a mix of cheap magnetic tape and disinfectant\u2014and the Sands\u2019 former parking garage is rank with it. Asian businessmen move through the aisles in dense graceful packs and are assiduously cheery and polite. A young guy in a full-color Frankenstein T-shirt is spraypainting cartoon flames on an actress\u2019s breasts at the Sin City booth. The actress\u2014an obscure one, not even Filth and Hecuba know her name\u2014has normal-size breasts, and there\u2019s not much of an audience. Producer/director Max Hardcore draws a way bigger crowd at the MAXWORLD booth, where one of his girls is squatting on the countertop masturbating with the butt of a riding crop. Max\u2019s videos\u2019 promotional posters have him carrying a girl in minishorts over his shoulder against the backdrop of various city skylines; the pitches at the bottom say \u201cSEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL! SEE CUM-SPLATTERED GIRLS TOO STUPID TO KNOW BETTER!\u201d Max is a story all to himself, according to Harold Hecuba. D. Filth and a porn executive dressed entirely in Campbell Nightwatch plaid are smoking cigars and keep holding their cigars up together and comparing the ash to see which one has the cleanest burn. A lot of the industry males and even some of the starlets are also smoking cigars. 1998 is definitely the Year of the Cigar. The starlets are all in either extremely formal cocktail dresses or else abbreviated latex/vinyl/ Lycra ensembles. Heels are uniformly sharp and ultrahigh. Some of the starlets are so heavily made up they look embalmed. They tend to have complexly coiffed hair that looks really good from 20 feet away but on closer inspection is dry and dead. Someone who is either sometime-performer Jeff Marton or \u201cBizarro-Sleaze\u201d filmmaker Gregory Dark is doing sleight-of-hand tricks with his trademark fedora.7 Whoever he is, he has a goatee. Harold Hecuba also has a goatee; Dick Filth has more like a soul patch. H.H. and D.F., longtime industry journalists, know everybody here and keep getting stopped and drawn into conversations. (These delays, during which yr. corresps. sort of stand there awkwardly at the edge of the conversation and try to look around as if they too know people here and are waiting only to spot them in the crowd before they go off and get into their own involved conversations, have not been included in the 132-minute Adult CES-traversal average.) This year, a good 75 percent of the males in and around the porn industry appear to be sporting variants of the goatee.8\n\nNext to the Outlaw Video booth, a starlet in a gold lam\u00e9 spaghetti-strap gown, chewing gum and blowing large blue bubbles, is being videotaped by a disabled fan whose camera and parabolic mike are bolted to the arm of his wheelchair; the starlet is pointing to the tattoos on her left arm and appears to be explaining the origin and context of each one. At the Vivid Video multibooth complex,9 Ms. Taylor Hayes has what is probably the longest autograph-and-flesh-press line in the entire Sands garage. Taylor is major-league pretty\u2014she looks like a slightly debauched Cindy Crawford\u2014and an oversize monitor suspended from the ceiling over the Vivid area plays clips of her scantily clad and dancing amid dry-ice fumes. There\u2019s a berm of boxed videos on the floor by the counter and a huge man with a visor and handheld credit card machine on Taylor\u2019s right flank as she greets each fan like a long-lost relative. According to Dick Filth, Taylor is both a genuinely nice person and a consummate pro.\n\nThe booth for XPlor Media\u2014a company known for its \u201cSouthern Belles\u201d video series and ORGY FOR WORLD PEACE Website\u2014is arresting because all the execs at XPlor seem to be under 25 and the booth\u2019s atmosphere is that of a fraternity party in its third straight day. One young bald guy is unconscious in a fetal position on the counter, and some wag has glued all sorts of feathers and flaccid plastic two-headed dildoish things to his skull. XPlor\u2019s owner-auteurs are two brothers, trust-fund babies from a Connecticut suburb of NYC. Their names are Farrel and Moffitt Timlake. Farrel, who wears twelve-hole Doc Martens and cargo pants and what\u2019s either a very light parka or very heavy sweatshirt with a hood that stays up at all times, is a particular cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre at the \u201998 CES because he\u2019s apparently a friend of the two guys who do South Park, and these guys are rumored to be in Vegas and to possess tickets to Saturday\u2019s Awards banquet.10\n\nEveryone without exception is sweating. At all but a few of the booths, contract starlets treat the fans with the same absent, rigid-faced courtesy that flight attendants and restaurant hostesses tend to use. You can tell how bored the performers are by the way their faces light up when they see someone they know. Well over half of the industry\u2019s current superstars are in this huge room.11 The infamous T.T. Boy is here, standing alone with his trademark glower, the Boy who is rumored to bring a semiautomatic pistol with him to the set and who was featured in a 1995 New Yorker article that was full of lines like \u201cA porn shoot is an intricately delineated ecology.\u201d Mr. Vince Vouyer (sic) is on hand, as are Seth Gecko, Jake Steed, Serenity, Missy, and Nick East. Here is the ageless Randy West, who looks just the way a surfer would look if that surfer were also a Mob enforcer, with his perennial tan and hair like frozen surf. Mr. Jon Dough\u2014winner of AVN\u2019s coveted Best Actor/Video statuette in both \u201996 and \u201997\u2014alternates between various booths, wearing his customary expression of having psychologically evolved to the point where he\u2019s so incredibly cool and detached that life is one long yawn. Here also is Mark Davis, far and away the most handsome of the current males, a near-double for Gregory Harrison of the old Trapper John series except for Davis\u2019s ultrashort psych-patient haircut (plus goatee).\nAnd 20-year veteran Joey Silvera is at this year\u2019s CES, though mostly in his capacity as an auteur: Silvera now directs Evil Angel\u2019s popular \u201cButt Row\u201d video series.12 Following the lead of pioneers like John Leslie and Paul Thomas, most of today\u2019s top male stars now also direct (and, per the store boxes, \u201cPresent\u201d) their own line of videos, e.g. \u201cTom Byron\u2019s Cumback Pussy\u201d series, \u201cJon Dough\u2019s Dirty Stories,\u201d the eye-popping Rocco Siffredi\u2019s \u201c[Various European Cities] By Night\u201d line, etc. The So-and-So Presents series seems to be an industry trend, like cigars and goatees.\n\nIt is difficult to describe how it feels to gaze at living human beings whom you\u2019ve seen perform in hard-core porn. To shake the hand of a man whose precise erectile size, angle, and vasculature are known to you. That strange I-think-we\u2019ve-met-before sensation one feels upon seeing any celebrity in the flesh is here both intensified and twisted. It feels intensely twisted to see reigning industry queen Jenna Jameson chilling out at the Vivid booth in Jordaches and a latex bustier and to know already that she has a tattoo of a sundered valentine with the tagline HEART BREAKER on her right buttock and a tiny hairless mole just left of her anus. To watch Peter North try to get a cigar lit and to have that sight backlit by memories of his artilleryesque ejaculations.13 To have seen these strangers\u2019 faces in orgasm\u2014that most unguarded and purely neural of expressions, the one so vulnerable that for centuries you basically had to marry a person to get to see it.14 This weirdness may account for some of the complex emotional intercourse taking place between the performers and fans at the Adult CES. The patrons may leer and elbow one another at a distance, but by the time the men get to the front of the line and face the living incarnation of their VCR\u2019s fantasy-babe, most of them turn into quivering goggle-eyed schoolboys, sheepish and salivaless and damp. The same thing evidently happens at the hundreds of strip clubs all over the country where porn starlets appear as Featured Dancers (for five figures a week, according to Filth) and do photos and autographs after the show:\n\n\u201cMost of these guys become incredibly nervous when I come up to them,\u201d veteran starlet Shane has explained. \u201cI\u2019ll put my arms around a guy and his whole body will be trembling. They pretty much do whatever I tell them to do.\u201d The whole industry, now, has this oddly reversed equation\u2014the consumers are the ones who seem ashamed or shy, while the performers are cocky and smooth and 100 percent pro.\nIt is no longer the 1980s, and the Meese Commission mentality that led to a major crackdown on video porn is long gone. Federal task forces and PTA outrage are now focused on the Internet and kiddie porn. But today\u2019s adult industry is still hypersensitive about what it perceives as fascist attacks on its First Amendment freedoms. A specially prepared trailer now runs before many higher-end adult videos, right between the legal disclaimer on the product\u2019s compliance with or exemption from 18 U.S.C \u00a72257 and ads for phone services like 900-666-FUCK. Against shots of flowing flags and the Lincoln Memorial, a voiceover says stuff like:\n\nCensorship goes against our Bill of Rights and the founding principles of this country. It is an attempt on the part of the government to legislate morality and to stifle free expression.15 This new, \u201clegal\u201d morality is dangerous to all Americans. Vote for those who believe in limiting government intrusion into your personal affairs. Vote against government control of your life and home. Vote against censorship. Only you, the People, can keep the American ideal intact.\n\nThese trailers always say they\u2019re sponsored by either the Adult Video Association or something called the Free Speech Coalition. Both organizations (and the extent to which the two are separate is unclear) are basically industry PACs. Porn, in other words, has taken the political lessons of the \u201980s to heart; it is now a hard-lobbying political force no less than GM or RJR Nabisco.\n\nFeminists of all different stripe oppose the adult industry for reasons having to do with pornography\u2019s putative effects on women. Their arguments are well-known and in some respects persuasive. But certain antiporn arguments in the 1990s are now centered on adult entertainment\u2019s alleged effects on the men who consume it. Some \u201cmasculists\u201d believe that a lot of men get addicted to video porn in a way that causes grievous psychic harm. Example: An essayist named David Mura has a little book called A Male Grief: Notes on Pornography and Addiction, which is a bit New Agey but interesting in places, e.g.:\n\nAt the essence of pornography is the image of flesh used as a drug, a way of numbing psychic pain. But this drug lasts only as long as the man stares at the image\u2026 . In pornographic perception, each gesture, each word, each image, is read first and foremost through sexuality. Love or tenderness, pity or compassion, become subsumed by, and are made subservient to, a \u201cgreater\u201d deity, a more powerful force\u2026 . The addict to pornography desires to be blinded, to live in a dream. Those in the thrall of pornography try to eliminate from their consciousness the world outside pornography, and this includes everything from their family and friends or last Sunday\u2019s sermon to the political situation in the Middle East. In engaging in such elimination the viewer reduces himself. He becomes stupid.\n\nThis kind of stuff might sound a little out-there, maybe, until one observes the eerie similarity between the eyes of males in strip clubs or stroke parlors and the eyes of people in their fifth hour of pumping silver dollars into the slot machines of the Sands\u2019 casino, or maybe until one\u2019s seen firsthand the odd kind of shock on the faces of CES patrons seeing performers now \u201cin the flesh,\u201d complete with chewing gum and chin-pimples and all the human stuff you never see\u2014never want to see\u2014in films.\n\nMaybe just a little bit more here on the whole scene at the Adult CES, which is a lot more of a rub-elbows-type venue than the stylized Awards ceremony is going to end up being\u2026 . Mr. Harold Hecuba is deep in conversation with a marginal porn producer about one of his performers\u2019 being sidelined with something called a \u201cprolapsed sphincter,\u201d which condition yr. corresps. decline to follow up on in any way. We are standing just west of a staff writer for Digital Horizons who\u2019s dropped by to scope out the legendary scene in here again this year and is telling two presumed other tech writers that being around porn people always makes him feel like he\u2019s been somehow astrally projected onto a cocktail napkin. It is also roughly now that Ms. Jasmin St. Claire is making an appearance at the Impressive Media booth in order to spell the starlet behind the counter, who is limping to the booth\u2019s rear area; she (i.e., the limping starlet) has (reportedly) had to be sprayed with silicon to fit into her pants. The crowd at the Impressive Media venue immediately starts to enlarge. Jasmin St. Claire is wearing a red vinyl jacket-and-miniskirt ensemble. A porn starlet entering any kind of room or area has a distinctive energy about her\u2014you turn your head to look even if you don\u2019t seem to want to. It\u2019s like watching a figure from a pinball machine illustration or high-concept comic book step out into 3-D and head your way. It turns out really to be possible to feel as though your eyeballs are protruding slightly from their sockets. What makes the whole thing so weird is that Jasmin St. Claire isn\u2019t even all that pretty, at least not today. Her hair is dyed black in that cheap unreal Goth way, and she is so incredibly heavily made up that she looks like a crow. (She is also somewhat knock-kneed, plus of course has the requisite Howitzer-grade bust.) Ms. St. Claire is being escorted to the Impressive booth by two large men whose expressions are describable only as mug-shottish. This is another thing about porn starlets\u2014they\u2019re never alone. They\u2019re always accompanied by at least one and sometimes as many as four flinty-eyed males. The impression is that of a very expensive thoroughbred being led onto the track under a silk blanket.\n\nFYI, Ms. Jasmin St. Claire\u2019s cult-celebrity status at the \u201998 CES stems from her having broken the \u201cWorld Gang Bang Record\u201d16 by taking on 300 men in a row in Amazing Pictures\u2019 1996 World\u2019s Biggest Gang Bang 2. Since most of these 300 men were amateur porn-fans who\u2019d had only to fill out an application and produce an HIV all-clear from the DPH, she now enjoys an almost legendary populist appeal\u2014\u201cthe People\u2019s Porn Star\u201d\u2014and an enormous serpentine line of fans with cameras and autographable memorabilia has formed at the Impressive booth, which line Ms. St. Claire appears for the moment to be ignoring, because she and H. Hecuba, having exchanged double-cheek kisses, are now deep into some kind of t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate above the sockless Docksiders of the unconscious bald kid, who\u2019s (the kid has) evidently been carried or trundled by pranksters unknown from the XPlor counter (right next door) to this one. Dick Filth\u2014after your correspondents have remarked on how it\u2019s kind of heartwarming that everyone in the porn industry all seem to be friends, even critics and performers\u2014dishes an involved anecdote about how Jasmin St. Claire apparently once actually tried to strangle Harold Hecuba at an industry soir\u00e9e a couple years ago, an anecdote which, if you\u2019re interested, appears as FN17 just below. Twenty feet away, over at XPlor, Mr. Farrel Timlake has meanwhile produced what is alleged to be the prototype and world\u2019s only authorized Kenny\u00ae Action Figure from the upcoming South Park merchandising line\u2014fourteen inches tall, kind of heavy for a doll, w/ hood up and face obscured (not unlike F. Timlake\u2019s own hood and face)\u2014and is entertaining some of the IM crowd\u2019s spillover by manipulating the doll\u2019s limbs to simulate its \u201ctok[ing] a bone.\u201d\n\nNot unlike urban gangs, police, carnival workers, and certain other culturally marginalized guilds, the US porn industry is occluded and insular in a way that makes it seem like high school. There are cliques, anticliques, alliances, betrayals, conflagratory rumors, legendary enmities, and public bloodlettings, plus involved hierarchies of popularity and influence. You\u2019re either In or you\u2019re not. Performers, being the industry\u2019s fissile core, are of course In. Despite their financial power, studio execs and producers are not very In, and directors (especially those who\u2019ve never undergone the initiation of having on-camera sex themselves) are less In than the performers. Film reviewers and industry journalists are even less In than execs; and nonindustry journalists are way, way non-In, almost as low-caste as the great mass of porn fans themselves (for which fans the Insider term is: mook18 ).\n\nThe foregoing is meant to help explain how exactly your correspondents ended up in porn titan Max Hardcore\u2019s personal suite at the Sahara and got to hang out in the suite\u2019s living room with Max, certain of his crew, porn starlets Alex Dane and Caressa Savage, and two B-girls\u2014which is to say that it was actually Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth who were invited to hang out in the suite on Friday afternoon, but yr. corresps. clung almost like papooses to their backs, and the burly MAXWORLD Production Assistant wasn\u2019t quick enough about slamming the door.\nSo yr. corresps. were, for a couple hours, at least logistically speaking, In.\n\nFor a regular civilian male, hanging out in a hotel suite with porn starlets is a tense and emotionally convolved affair. There is, first, the matter of having seen the various intimate activities and anatomical parts of these starlets in videos heretofore and thus (weirdly) feeling shy about meeting them. But there is also a complex erotic tension. Because porn films\u2019 worlds are so sexualized, with everybody seemingly teetering right on the edge of coitus all the time and it taking only the slightest nudge or excuse\u2014a stalled elevator, an unlocked door, a cocked eyebrow, a firm handshake\u2014to send everyone tumbling into a tangled mass of limbs and orifices, there\u2019s a bizarre unconscious expectation/dread/ hope that this is what might happen in Max Hardcore\u2019s hotel room. Yr. corresps. here find it impossible to overemphasize the fact that this is a delusion. In fact, of course, the unconscious expectation/dread/hope makes no more sense than it would make to be hanging out with doctors at a medical convention and to expect that at the slightest provocation everyone in the room would tumble into a frenzy of MRIs and epidurals. Nevertheless the tension persists, despite the fact that the actresses are obviously tired and disassociated from the day\u2019s CES,19 plus, it emerges, somewhat sore\u2014it turns out that Max Hardcore is shooting one of his \u201cGonzo\u201d porn spectaculars right here at the 1998 Consumer Electronics Show, using the CES as a hook and backdrop, and the girls have been alternating CES booth-duty and riding-crop shenanigans with a tight and SS-intensive filming schedule. (Max, being a firm believer in the fait accompli method of filmmaking, has not yet gotten around to chatting with the CES\u2019s administration about his featuring the world\u2019s biggest consumer-tech tradeshow by name in a \u201cSEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL\u201d video.)\n\nMr. Max Hardcore\u2014a.k.a. Max Steiner, a.k.a. Paul Steiner, n\u00e9 Paul Little\u2014is 5'6\" and a very fit 135. He is somewhere between 40 and 60 years old and resembles more than anything a mesomorphic and borderline-psycho Henry Gibson. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and what has to be one of the very few long-sleeved Hawaiian shirts in existence anywhere. Once the PA guarding the door mellows out and introductions are made (H.H. managing to drop the name of this magazine several times in one sentence), Max reveals himself to be a genial and garrulous host and offers everybody disposable plastic cups of vodka before settling in with yr. corresps. to discuss what for Max are the most pressing and relevant issues at this year\u2019s AVN Awards, which issues are the career, reputation, personal history, and overall life philosophy of Mr. Max Hardcore.\n\nPioneered (depending whom you talk to) by either Max Hardcore or John (\u201cButtman\u201d) Stagliano, \u201cGonzo\u201d has become one of this decade\u2019s most popular and profitable genres of adult video. It\u2019s more or less a cross between an MTV documentary and the Hell panel from Bosch\u2019s Garden of Earthly Delights. A Gonzo film is always set at some distinctive locale or occasion\u2014Daytona Beach at spring break, the Cannes Film Festival, etc. There\u2019s always a randy and salivous \u201chost\u201d talking directly to a handheld camera: \u201cWell and we\u2019re here at the Cannes Film Festival, and it looks like there\u2019s going to be lots of excitement, John Travolta and Sigourney Weaver are supposed to both be in town, and there\u2019s also the world-famous beach, and I\u2019m told there\u2019s always some real seriously good-looking little girls at the beach, so let\u2019s us head on down.\u201d (That\u2019s the approximate lead-in to a recent Max-at-Cannes Gonzo, a type of signature lead-in that Max refers to with a 56-tooth grin as \u201calways mercifully brief\u201d\u2014and please note the \u201clittle girls at the beach\u201d thing, because this is another of Max\u2019s professional signatures, the infantilization of his videos\u2019 females as dramatic foils for his own film persona, which is always that of a sort of degenerate uncle or stepdad.) Then the shaky but ever-focused camera heads on down to the ocean or mall or CES or whatever, scoping out attractive women20 while the host moans and chews his knuckle in lust. Then pretty soon host and camera start actually coming up to the women they\u2019ve been looking at and engaging them in little cameo \u201cinterviews\u201d full of sideways leers and salacious entendres. Some of the interviewees are actual civilians, but some are always what Max refers to as \u201cringers,\u201d meaning professional porn actresses. And so the viewer is treated to the classic frathouse fantasy of moving, via just a couple of singles-bar \u201cHey there babe\u201d lines, from scoping out an attractive woman to having wild and anatomically diverse sex with her, all while one of his buddies captures the whole thing on tape.21\n\nThe issue of who exactly invented Gonzo being impossibly vexed and so notwithstanding, it is true that Max Hardcore is famous as a director for several things: (1) Being incredibly disciplined about budgets and tactical logistics, right down to forcing his crew and staff to wear identical jumpsuits of scarlet nylon so that they look like a national ski team\u2014Max\u2019s shoots are described (by Max) as \u201calmost military operations\u201d; (2) Not only employing ringers but actually sometimes being able to talk real live civilian \u201clittle girls\u201d on the beach or in the mall into coming on back to the special MAXWORLD RV and having anal sex on camera;22 (3) Being the first in \u201cmainstream\u201d (meaning nonfetish) adult video to perpetrate on women levels of violation and degradation that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. W/r/t item (3), Max, after detailing for yr. correspondents the vo- and avocations that led him into the adult industry (a tale too literally incredible even to think about factchecking and trying to print), informs us that he is and always has been adult video\u2019s \u201ccutting-edge blade,\u201d and that other less bold and original filmmakers have systematically stolen and used his, Max\u2019s, degradations of women as a blueprint for their own subsequent shabby and derivative films\u2019 degradations.23 (Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, by the way, have heard Max hold forth many times before and are now outside the circle of discourse\u2014D.F. in the bathroom for what seems like a peculiarly long time, H.H. on the couch with the actresses hashing out the implications of Seinfeld\u2019s retirement for NBC\u2019s \u201998 lineup.)\n\nAlone and in a place of conspicuous honor on a wood-finish shelf above the suite\u2019s minibar is an actual AVN Awards statuette. The trophy resembles an Oscar/Emmy/Clio except that the figurine\u2019s arms are up and out (making it also look a bit like Richard Nixon at the climax of the \u201968 GOP convention), and something slightly blurry about the casting gives it a sort of cubic-zirconium aspect. Whether the statuette is heavy and solid vs. hollow and Little Leaguish remains unknown\u2014there is no invitation to touch or heft it. One of the B-girls on the couch is now either laughing or weeping into her hands at something Harold Hecuba has said; her bare shoulders heave. It would be totally fantastic if the Seinfeld rerun on the huge TV were the episode about everybody trying to refrain from masturbating, but it isn\u2019t.\n\nAsked by one of yr. corresps. what he won this AVN Award on the shelf for, Max Hardcore slaps his knee: \u201cI fucking stole it.\u201d It\u2019s now that hard middle-distance inspection reveals that the MAX HARDCORE on the metal strip at the trophy\u2019s base has been scratched in by someone who is not a professional engraver. It looks done with a screwdriver, in fact. Max expands on the statuette caper: Shut inexplicably out of the Awards for years, he last year, upon exiting the stage (he\u2019s always a presenter every year, which he regards as the AVNAs\u2019 way of twisting the emotional blade), espied in the wings a large cardboard box filled with blank and unused AVN Award statuettes.24 Whereupon he thought, as he now puts it, \u201cWhat the fuck, I fucking deserve it\u201d and snagged one, hiding it in his enormous Stetson and deriving no little satisfaction from attending various post-Awards parties with an illicit statuette under his hat. Max\u2019s crew all laugh very hard at this anecdote, though the actresses don\u2019t.\n\nAlex Dane is now telling Harold Hecuba about a stray dog she found and has decided to keep. She is excited as she describes the dog and for a moment seems about fourteen; the impression lasts only a second or two and is heartbreaking. One of the B-girls, meanwhile, is explaining that she has just gotten a pair of cutting-edge breast implants that she can actually adjust the size of by adding or draining fluid via small valves under her armpits, and then\u2014perhaps mistaking your correspondents\u2019 expressions for ones of disbelief\u2014she raises her arms to display the valves. There really are what appear to be valves.\n\nSo much about today\u2019s adult industry seems like an undeft parody of Hollywood and the nation writ large. The top performers are comic-book caricatures of sexual allure. The prosthetic breasts and lifted buttocks and (no kidding) artificial cheekbones are nothing more than accentuations of a mentality that yields huge liposuction and collagen industries. The gynecologically explicit sexuality of Jenna, Jasmin, et al. seems more than anything like a Mad magazine spoof of the \u201csmoldering\u201d sexuality of Sharon Stone and Madonna and so many other mainstream iconettes.25 Not to mention the fact that the adult industry takes many of the psychological deformities that Hollywood is famous for\u2014the vanity, the vulgarity, the rank commercialism\u2014and not only makes them overt and grotesque but seems then to revel in that grotesquerie.\n\nGood old Max Hardcore, for instance, is a total psychopath\u2014that\u2019s part of his on-screen Gonzo persona\u2014but so is the real Max/Paul Steiner. You\u2019d almost have to have been there in that suite. Max sits holding court in his hat and pointy boots, looking at once magisterial and mindless, while his red-suited acolytes laugh on cue and a jr. high dropout shows off her valves. In truth, the first ten minutes of the impromptu interview in the Sahara are spent passing around a copy of something called Icon magazine, which Max has told us is doing a profile on him\u2014we are expected to leaf through the magazine and comment favorably on its content and layout while Max watches us in the same hyperexpectant way that parents watch you when you\u2019re looking at a snapshot of their kid that they\u2019ve taken out uninvited and pressed on you. This is the actual chronology. There then follows a torrent of autobiography and background that yr. corresps. have decided to deny Max the satisfaction of seeing reproduced here. After which is a kind of Max 101-like survey of personal philosophy and Gonzo theory and the statuette anecdote. The vodka is top-shelf and the plastic cups dusty. Then one of the starlets decides that she\u2019s hungry, and Max insists on escorting her down to the Sahara\u2019s restaurant and wants everybody else to come along, which eventually results in the B-girls and crewmen and yr. corresps.26 all standing there awkwardly at the ma\u00eetre d\u2019s podium while Max personally conducts the starlet to her table and pulls out her chair and tucks a serviette into her cleavage and pulls out a platinum-plated money clip and announces in a voice audible to everyone in the restaurant and foyer that he \u201cwant[s] to take care of the little girl\u2019s damages in advance\u201d and shoves bills into the hanky-pocket of the ma\u00eetre d\u2019s tuxedo and then leaves her there by herself and herds us all back out and into the elevator and jabs impatiently at the button for his suite\u2019s floor, almost jumping up and down with fury at the elevator\u2019s delay; and we\u2019re all rushed back up to the suite because it\u2019s occurred to Max that he wants to show your corresps. something from this week\u2019s filming that he thinks will sum up his particular porn genius better than any amount of exposition could \u2026 and then, reseated, he starts flipping through a notebook to find something.\n\n\u201cWhat it is is we got this one little girl back in the [infamous MAXWORLD] trailer, and after some face-fucking27 and reaming her asshole and, like, your standard depravities, we get her to stick a pen\u2014no, a what-do-you-call \u2026\u201d\n\nCrewman: \u201cMagic Marker.\u201d\n\nMax: \u201c\u2026 Magic Marker, stick it up her asshole and write all this \u2026 this stuff,\u201d holding up the notebook, opened to a page; again he has us pass it around:\n\nis thereon written in a hand28 that seems impressively legible, considering. Dick Filth makes a waggish inquiry about future film plans involving this girl and a typewriter, but Max doesn\u2019t laugh (we noticed that Max never laughs at a joke he hasn\u2019t told), and so neither does anyone else.\n\nDoubtless most of this is going to get cut by Premiere, but it\u2019s worth also observing\u2014when this magazine\u2019s assigned photographer (who\u2019s also gotten in here with us this afternoon on H.H. and D.F.\u2019s coattails) begins wondering aloud about the possibility of getting some good portraits at the Awards of winners holding their statuettes\u2014the way Max right away jumps in with his idea of the perfect photo for the title page of this very article. The proposed shot is to be of Max Hardcore, holding several of the AVN Awards trophies he pledges either to win straight up or to gain possession of in other ways, seated in some kind of imperial-looking and really nice chair that is itself set up on the palm-studded boulevard of the famous Las Vegas Strip\u2014so the photographer\u2019ll get lots of smeary neon and appropriately phallic bldgs. in the background\u2014with a retinue of scantily clad starlets either draped swoonily over him or prostrate at his feet, or both. It is important to note that there are no audible scare-quotes, no irony or embarrassment or self-awareness of any sort on Max\u2019s face as he sketches this photo\u2019s tableau for us; he\u2019s in the kind of earnest that one imagines Irving Thalberg was always in.29 Your correspondents immediately begin to lobby hard for Max\u2019s idea, figuring that the photo would make a great illustration for the story of Max\u2019s proposing this very photo\u2014i.e., that it would point up the megalomania far more powerfully than mere reportage\u2014but the Premiere photographer, who is no actor, does such a poor job of disguising his repulsion at Max\u2019s self-regard that the atmosphere of the whole suite gets stilted and complexly hostile, and the rest of the interview is kind of a fizzle-yield, and overall Dick Filth said that we failed, in his phrase, to \u201cpenetrate to the core of the essence of what it is to be Max Hardcore.\u201d30\n\nThe 15th Annual AVN Awards are actually split over two consecutive nights, a tactic that Max H. thought the legit Oscars would do well to emulate: \u201cGet all the bullshit out of the way the first night\u2014best packaging, marketing, best gay, shit like that. Who wants to sit through that shit?\u201d\n\nHeld in a different, slightly smaller Caesars Palace ballroom, Friday\u2019s Awards show is indeed brisk. The ephemeral categories include Best Videography, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Music. Each category\u2019s nominees are listed in the program, but only the winners are announced onstage, and they\u2019re announced four at a time, and applause is discouraged, and the master of ceremonies keeps telling the quartets of winners that \u201cIf you\u2019ll come on up quickly and help keep things moving it\u2019ll help us out a lot.\u201d Friday\u2019s only food is big wheels of vegetables and dip near the cash bar. The emcee is not headliner Robert Schimmel but a hypomanic guy named Dave Tyree, whose interpolated banter is 78 rpm and consists of stuff like \u201cIf God didn\u2019t want us to jerk off he would\u2019ve made our arms shorter.\u201d There are maybe 1,000 people in attendance, most only slightly dressed up, and there are no assigned tables, and everybody in the ballroom is moving around and chattering and treating the onstage proceedings the way people in a cocktail lounge treat the piano player.\n\nQ. $4,000,000,000 and 8,000 new releases a year\u2014why is adult video so popular in this country?\nA. Director and AVN-Hall-of-Fame inductee F. J. Lincoln: \u201cIt\u2019s always a little funny how it\u2019s called adult. What it really is, you get to be a kid again. You roll around and get dirty. It\u2019s the adult sandbox.\u201d\nA. Veteran woodman Joey Silvera: \u201cDudes, let\u2019s face it\u2014America wants to jerk off.\u201d\nA. Industry journalist Harold Hecuba: \u201cIt\u2019s the new Barnum. Nobody ever goes broke overestimating the rage and misogyny of the average American male.\u201d\nA. Porn starlet Jacklyn Lick: \u201cI think a lot of fans are very lonely people.\u201d\nQ. There don\u2019t seem to be a whole lot of condoms used in hard-core scenes.\nA. Harold Hecuba: \u201cNever have been. They\u2019re viewed as a turn-off. This business is about engineering fantasies.\u201d\nQ. But even just venerially\u2014all these anal shenanigans and everything. Is there much worry in the industry about HIV?\nA. Harold Hecuba: \u201cThere\u2019s not as much worry about AIDS now. Everybody gets tested on a schedule.\u201d\nQ. What about herpes?\nA. H.H.: \u201cI think it\u2019s rampant.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s Best-Sex-Scene-in-a-Film winner Vince Vouyer\u2019s real name turns out to be John LaForme. Rhetorical Q.: How, if one\u2019s real name was John LaForme, could that person possibly feel the need for a nom de guerre?\n\nMr. Tom Byron describes being able to tumesce and ejaculate more or less on demand as an exercise in \u201ccontrol, like meditation or surfing. It\u2019s like a gymnast staying on the balance beam. You practice enough, you can do anything.\u201d31\n\nFormer woodman and current auteur Paul Thomas was a member of the original Broadway cast of Jesus Christ Superstar.\n\nThe tall, crazed-looking, and ever-rampant Mike Horner, three-time Best Actor winner and a member of the AVN Hall of Fame,32 is actually a classically trained opera singer.\n\nDeceased starlet Nancy Kelly\u2019s real name was Kelly Van Dyke. She was the daughter of TV\u2019s Jerry Van Dyke and so, of course, the niece of Dick.\n\nExotic rookie actress Midori, one of the nominees in the \u201998 AVNAs\u2019 Best New Starlet category, is the sister of \u201980s pop star Jodi Whatley. Midori has stated publicly that she views upscale contemporary porn as a stepping-stone to a mainstream career, not unlike becoming Miss America or doing a couple seasons on SNL. Harold Hecuba characterizes Midori\u2019s career strategy as \u201cgrievously ill-advised.\u201d\n\nAdult Video News VP and Executive Editor Gene Ross, presenting the aforementioned 1998 AVN Award for Best Director/Video to Miscreants\u2019 Rob Black, will hail Mr. Black as \u201ca guy who can take buttholes, midgets, and fried fish, and make a love story.\u201d33\n\nFrom The New Yorker\u2019s 1995 article on the psychosexual plight of the adult industry\u2019s woodman: \u201cThe Cal Jammers who are part of this feminization feel they have stormed the walls of female ornament to reclaim male prerogative, only to find themselves lost in a garden of gender irony.\u201d\n\nMr. John \u201cButtman\u201d Stagliano\u2014CEO of Evil Angel Inc., a man described by US News & World Report as \u201cthe nation\u2019s leading director of hard-core videos\u201d\u2014not only has publicly announced testing positive for HIV but has identified the infection\u2019s vector as a transsexual prostitute in S\u00e3o Paulo with whom Stagliano had unprotected anal intercourse in 1995. He\u2019s anxious that people not get the wrong idea: \u201cI am not particularly interested in guys, but I am interested in dicks. Forbidden taboos lead to all sorts of neurotic behavior, which leads to me being fucked in the ass without a rubber.\u201d\n\nAre the AVN Awards possibly rigged? Max Hardcore (he of the purloined statuette, keep in mind) calls the Awards \u201ca total conflict of interests.\u201d After all, he explains, Adult Video News is heavily ad-dependent,34 and they\u2019re under \u201cpressure from the big hitters like Vivid and VCA to like, you know, give the nod.\u201d\n\nMs. Ellen Thompson, AVN Associate Editor and an Awards judge who votes under the n.d.g. Ida Slapter:35 \u201cWe\u2019ve heard this for years. I hear this complaining also goes on in the mainstream. I don\u2019t like insulting anybody, but sometimes there\u2019s sour grapes. What are we supposed to say? Vivid and VCA put out good product. We truly, honestly do vote fairly.\u201d\n\nMr. Dick Filth: \u201cThe best perception, backed up by tons of anecdotal evidence, is that they are totally, totally fixed and rigged.\u201d\nSaturday\u2019s the big night. The banquet, the onstage entertainment, the headline Awards. See & be seen. Gamblers and conventioneers and mooks of all ilk are massed at the Caesars cabstand to watch the starlets arrive. There are camcorders and flashbulbs but no paparazzi per se. Some of the performers come in limos, others in shiny penile sports cars; others seem to mysteriously just suddenly appear. There are even more starlets here than there were at the CES, and they are seriously dolled up. There are cerise halters and pear-colored Lycra bodysuits with open-toed pumps of burgundy suede. There are platinum lam\u00e9 gowns slit all the way to the tenth rib. Bottoms less covered than shellacked look like they by all rights should have panty- or at least thong lines but do not have such lines. There are lime-green vinyl leotards and toile bellbottoms and fishscale bustiers and miniskirts the same texture and length as a tutu\u2019s ruffle. Garter straps flash and Merry Widow bodices shade the interiors of translucent blouses. Several of the outfits defy very basic precepts of modern physics. Coiffures are towering and complex. The starlets are all on the arms of men, but none of these escorts are male porn performers. Average heel-height is 4\"+. A loud-voiced civilian in the cabstand crowd actually utters the phrase \u201cVa Va Voom,\u201d which yr. correspondents had never before heard anywhere outside a Sinatra movie. Breasts are uniformly zeppelinesque and in various perilous stages of semiconfinement. Max Hardcore is under a Stetson the color of weak chocolate milk, and his adjustable B-girl\u2014arrayed in a type of scarlet cowboy suit that\u2019s mostly fringe\u2014has inflated her breasts to what\u2019s got to be maximum capacity.\n\nWoodman-wise, black is clearly In at the 15th Annual AVNAs. A lot of the men are in black tuxedos and black ties and black dress shirts. One is wearing a paisley suit of either serge or some kind of upholstery material. Another has silver platform shoes and a silver vest w/ no shirt underneath. The XPlor boys are in Klein sweatshirts and urban-camouflage fatigues, and there\u2019s a large contingent with them that may or may not include the South Park brain trust. A guy on the arm of Ms. Morgan Fairlane has an immense and razorous violet mohawk \u00e0 la British punks of the late 1970s.\n\nInside the hotel, a kind of impromptu cocktail party forms in the broad marble hall outside Caesars Palace\u2019s largest and reportedly classiest ballroom, which is called Caesars Forum. Burly casino staffers stand taking tickets and being very discouraging about anybody trying to bum-rush the show. The crush of bodies out here entails a degree of physical contact that CES mooks never even dreamed of. There are pockets of klieg-glare as cable TV reporters interview various performers about (sic:) the air of keen excitement in the air. Mysterious bundles of co-ax emerge from under the Forum doors and go all the way up the length of the hallway and disappear around the corner. A suspicion that we\u2019d had all week but decided was unverifiable is now instantly verified when one of yr. corresps. gets accidentally shoved against a starlet and is jabbed in the side by her breasts and it hurts. A lot of people are holding drinks in plastic glasses and it\u2019s unknown where they got them. The starlets take turns getting interviewed re atmospheric excitement while the woodmen all avoid the cameras like mafiosi. The TV lights are not doing anyone\u2019s skin tone any good at all. In their all-black tuxes, several of the male Insiders\u2014including e.g. John Leslie and Tony Tedeschi\u2014are so pallid and sallow as to appear diseased. Mr. Nick East devotes a full 5.5 minutes of rapt concentration to the cuticle of his left thumb. A slight surprise is that a lot of the industry\u2019s elite woodmen are short\u20145'6\", 5'7\"36 \u2014and most of their companions tower over them. Dick Filth confirms that the contemporary industry\u2019s 5'6\" standard helps a prodigious male organ look even more prodigious on videotape, a medium that apparently does all kinds of strange things to perspective.\n\nTickets for Saturday\u2019s main event are $195 per, in advance. It\u2019s unclear whether any Insiders\u2019 tickets are comped, but journalists pay full retail. Our tickets designate our table as #189. Twenty-five hundred tickets have been sold, and since it\u2019s highly doubtful that anybody got past the flinty-eyed casino guys outside without a ticket, tonight\u2019s attendance can confidently be fixed at 2,500.\nThe Caesars Forum ballroom itself is a huge L-shape with the stage at the\u2014as it were\u2014joint; thus half of the 15th Annual AVN Awards\u2019 audience is geometrically invisible to the other half. This problem is addressed via six sail-sized video screens that hang from the ceiling at strategic points throughout the auditorium. During the nearly two hours37 between when the doors open and the Awards show actually starts, the screens alternate quick clips from porn classics38 (recall that the theme of the 15th AAVNAs is \u201cThe History of Adult\u201d) with live shots of various people making their entrances and mugging for the remote cameras AVN has got circling the room.\n\nBoth Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth have come equipped with binoculars (H.H.\u2019s in a very official-looking Audubon Society case), which seems mysterious until we all arrive at Table 189, which is at the very, very back of the ballroom\u2019s L\u2019s northern leg, hundreds of yards from even the nearest video screen. \u201cThey always put the print guys out in mookland,\u201d Hecuba explains. This fact is unpleasant surprise #1. Unpleasant surprise #2 is the supper the $195 includes, which turns out to be buffet-steam-table-style and might best be described by inviting you to imagine a very cosmopolitan and multiethnic hospital cafeteria. 39 Several of the male Insiders, we now notice, have brought in their own picnic hampers.\n\nNow moving w/ laden plate to a table near us is a man in a full-body leopardskin suit whose way of acknowledging people he knows is to point at them rather than wave at them. On his arm is a B-girl in a body stocking made of what appears to be a densely woven net. Two Astral Ocean Cinema contract starlets have on identical copper-colored beaded gowns with myriad lengthwise slits in the skirt parts\u2019 fronts and backs and sides, so that as they walk to their table their upper halves look normal and their lower halves seem to be passing through an infinity of bead curtains. Obviously, the whole scene is overwhelming. The average American rarely gets to see aerobic legwarmers with 4\" spike heels. The Caesars Forum ceiling is the color of rancid meringue; it has 24 chandeliers that are designed to look like concentric opened fans but actually look more like labia or very well-organized fungus. Mr. Joey Buttafuoco is in the house, accompanying40 Al Goldstein of Screw, who is here to receive a Special AVN Achievement Award for His Lifelong Defense of the First Amendment. Black is so resoundingly In this year that even the starched linen napkins at everyone\u2019s place settings are black. The wineglasses all have little frosted cameos of J. Caesar on them. Humorless men with walkie-talkies stand guard at each of the ballroom\u2019s fire doors\u2014apparently last year there were some problems with unauthorized Caesars Palace employees sneaking in to watch the gala. The video screens are now showing the climactic scene of Debbie Does Dallas, the one where the nebbishy little stand-in for all mooks everywhere finally has sex with Bambi Woods and then the screen flashes \u201cNEXT?\u201d The South Park boys are indeed in attendance, up at Table 37 w/ Farrel and the XPlor coterie. There are also rumors that Boogie Nights auteur Paul Thomas Anderson possesses a ticket to the gala and might show up.41\n\nThe closest thing to any kind of Insider table near ours is #182, which according to its black table-tent is reserved for Anabolic Video (not an industry force) and is currently occupied by a spiriferously coiffed and sullenly chewing Dina Jewel (who declines to return Harold Hecuba\u2019s blown kiss) and her escort, a young fellow whom one can easily envision head-butting somebody in a mosh pit. D. Filth confides that this Anabolic guy is a close friend of woodman Vince Vouyer (again, sic), who himself is not up for many \u201998 Awards because he spent a good part of the past year in court and/or detention for helping operate an escort service which authorities alleged was not a bona fide escort service at all.\n\nIt turns out that Hecuba and Filth have kept from yr. correspondents as unpleasant surprise #3 the single chintziest thing about the $195-a-head 15th AAVNAs banquet & gala: Beverages are not compris. And not just alcohol, either; even a lousy club soda w/ lime42 is $6.00. Worse, it turns out you can\u2019t run any sort of tab\u2014you have to pay the waiter in cash when you order the lousy club soda w/ lime, and he (theoretically) brings your change back with the beverage. Thus a separate and memory-intensive transaction is required for each drink that each of the six-to-eight persons at each of the appr. 375 tables in the auditorium might order, with additional complications if certain people are buying drinks for certain tablemates but not for certain other tablemates, etc.43 The whole unfree-drink situation is incredibly annoying, not only because of the outlandish ticket price but because the ballroom\u2019s 100 percent Middle Eastern waiters (decent and hardworking fellows all, to be sure, who are taking some serious abuse about the pay-as-you-go beverage policy from mooks with cigars at the nearby tables, despite the fact that the waiters don\u2019t make the rules and must surely find having to remember and make change for six to eight different customers per table a piercing pain in the ass44 ) have only rudimentary ESL skills and tend to confuse both drink orders and currency denominations. Dick Filth leans over and shouts: \u201cNow you can maybe see why this is a multibillion-a-year industry\u2014they\u2019re tight as a duck\u2019s butt!\u201d45\n\nThe crowd lingers over hypersucrotic cake and coffee and $9.00 cordials and howls conversation at itself for 90 more minutes before the house lights dim and the 15th Annual AVN Awards gala starts. What follows thereon is a kaleidoscopic flux of stilted acceptances and blue one-liners and epileptic strobes and spotlights following winners\u2019 serpentine and high five-studded paths to the stage, of everything from generic Awards Show schmaltz to moments of near-Periclean eloquence, as in e.g.:\n\n\u201cFellow MENSA members and aficionados of Shakespeare!\u201d intones Al Goldstein of Screw, 62 and obese and white-bearded and crazy-haired and dressed in a sportcoat whose lapels are two different primary colors, looking pretty much exactly like that one certain old guy in the neighborhood your mom warned you never to try to sell Cub Scout chocolate mints to, and glorying in a Special AVN Achievement Award he confesses to feeling he\u2019s long deserved. \u201cI want to thank my mother, who spread her legs and made all this possible.\u201d Large sections of the crowd are on their feet\u2014Goldstein is a porn icon. He was distributing NYC\u2019s Screw on photostat when most of the people in this room were still playing with their toes. He\u2019s been a First Amendment ninja. He drinks in the applause and loves it and is hard not to sort of almost actually like. He\u2019s clearly an avatar of contemporary porn\u2019s unabashedness, its modern Yeah-OK-I\u2019m-Scum-but-Underneath-All-Your-Hypocrisy-So- Are-You-and-at-Least-I-Have-the-Guts-to-Admit-It-and-Have-a-Good-Time persona:\n\n\u201cI salute the women with eleven-IQs and the men with eleven-inch cocks. The real heroes are the cocks and pussies who fuck on-screen. They\u2019re the real heroes.\u201d Goldstein is less conducted than borne back to his seat.\n\nThis has followed Robert Schimmel\u2019s intro and a 20-minute \u201cMusical Salute to the History of Adult,\u201d in which topless dancing girls do a medley of disco, new wave, and so on.46 The stage band is ragged and unevenly amplified, and they all have flared collars and tight perms\u2014it\u2019s like watching The Brady Bunch\u2019s final season through borrowed binoculars. The stage is lit by autotrack spotlights whose colors alternate w/o discernible scheme.\n\nThe whole 15th AAVNAs Show lasts 3.5 hours and resembles nothing so much as an obscene and extremely well-funded high school assembly. The mix of garish self-congratulation47 and clumsy choreography is often so weird as to be endearing. There are never fewer than six presenters for each award, and they never seem to know whose turn it is to announce a nominee, and there are always a couple who don\u2019t get close enough to the mike to be audible and a couple others who get too close to the mike and produce a jolt of feedback that sends people and cocktails flying out of chairs in the first rows of tables. Wicked Pictures\u2019 Satyr, a multiple-category nominee, gets repeatedly pronounced \u201cSatter.\u201d Winners are supposed to exit stage-left after their acceptance speeches, but even people who\u2019ve won and been through the process several times in recent years keep forgetting and trying to exit stage-right and colliding with the hostesses who are there to escort them leftward. Some presenters insert brief rote antidrug messages into their intros, while around them twitch and sniff other presenters\u2014not many, but some\u2014who are obviously coked to the gills.\n\nProbably the most neutral and economical thing to say is that large parts of the ceremony are unintentionally funny. Winning woodmen extend earnest thanks to directors and execs for giving them \u201can opening\u201d or \u201ca shot\u201d or \u201cmy big shot\u201d and seem wholly unaware of the carnal entendres involved. Back at the journalists\u2019 table with us is a 40ish woman in two-piece Armani who\u2019s doing a spot on the Awards for ABC Radio; she spends most of the evening hunched over with her head in her hand and her tape recorder not even on. Dick Filth spends the show\u2019s whole second hour trying to track down a waiter who owes him beverage change. AVN\u2019s Gene Ross pays tribute to \u201998\u2019s Male Performer of the Year by saying: \u201cYou haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve seen Tom Byron\u2019s wrinkled nuts on a seventy-inch TV screen.\u201d Rob Black\u2019s Miscreants keeps getting nominated in category after category, and time and again there\u2019s a frantic caucus at the podium about the correct pronunciation of miscreant, complete with a couple of presenters audibly whispering what in the fuck is the word even supposed to mean.48\n\nTo be fair, some of the nominated products\u2019 titles are genuinely confusing. Triple Penetration Debutante Sluts 4 is up for Most Outrageous Sex Scene\u2014along with Wild Bananas on Butt Row and 87 and Still Bangin\u2019\u2014but loses out to a scene the Program entitles \u201cAnal Food Express\u201d49 from a video called My Girlfriend\u2019s Girlfriend. Paul Thomas\u2019s Bad Wives wins Best Film. Evil Angel\u2019s Buda wins Best Shot-on-Video Feature. The Best Foreign Release statuette goes to something European called President By Day, Hooker By Night. Bad Wives also wins Best Actress/Film for Dyanna Lauren, Best Supporting Actress/Film for Melissa Hill, and Best Anal Sex Scene/Film50 for Lauren and Steven St. Croix. Best Compilation Tape honors go to The Voyeur\u2019s Favorite Blow Jobs & Anals. David Cronenberg\u2019s mainstream Crash comes out of absolutely nowhere to win something called Best Alternative Adult Feature Film. Ms. Stephanie Swift wins Best Actress/Video and tells the crowd: \u201cThanks, everybody. My gang bang was a blast.\u201d51\n\nMax Hardcore, to Table 189\u2019s immense and unkind delight, doesn\u2019t win one single thing.\n\nAn actor named Jim Buck wins AVN\u2019s Gay Performer of the Year Award, and you better believe yr. corresps. sit bolt upright when the person who appears onstage to accept the award is a pink and leptosomatic 4'10\" and is wearing an Eton collar and appears, even under 125X binoculation, to be a twelve-year-old boy. And it turns out it is a twelve-year-old boy: It\u2019s Jim Buck\u2019s little brother. \u201cJim can\u2019t be here tonight because he\u2019s performing in a Shakespeare festival in New Orleans,\u201d the little boy says (correspondential expressions of bug-eyed inquiry at Hecuba and Filth\u2014Shakespeare festival? sending a prepubescent relative to collect your excellence-in-filmed-sodomy prize?\u2014are met with bemused shrugs), \u201cbut I\u2019m here to thank you on his behalf, and to say that I taught Jim everything he knows.\u201d [Enormous audience laugh and ovation, single spasmodic shudder from hunched ABC Radio lady.]\n\nA strange and traumatic experience which one of yr. corrs. will not even try to describe consists of standing at a men\u2019s room urinal between professional woodmen Alex Sanders and Dave Hardman. Suffice it to say that the urge to look over/down at their penises is powerful and the motives behind this urge so complex as to cause anuresis (which in turn ups the trauma). Be informed that male porn stars create around themselves the exact same opaque affective privacy- bubble that all men at urinals everywhere create. The whole Caesars Forum\u2019s men\u2019s room\u2019s urinal area is an angst festival; take it from us. The sink-and-mirror-and-towelette area, however, turns out to be a priceless mash of Insider jargon and shoptalk, all made extra-resonant by echolalic tile and a surfeit of six-dollar drinks. One performer-turned-auteur is telling a colleague about an exciting new project:\n\n\u201cFound this Russian, this chick like nineteen, can\u2019t speak a word of English, which for this [ = for the exciting project] is perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou going to get in there? Just for maybe like one scene?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah. That\u2019s the whole point. I\u2019m the director. This is my package now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh man though but you got to get in there. Just one scene. Nineteen, no English. Probably got a butthole about this big\u201d [illustrative gesture unseen because auditor is still standing complexly traumatized at urinal].\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see.\u201d [Mutual laughter replete w/ warmth of genuine friendship, fellow-feeling; exeunt.]\n\nThe Awards Show\u2019s planners have obviously studied at the Oscars\u2019 feet. Not only are the high-profile AVNAs held to the end\u2014though with occasional teasers like Best Supporting thrown into the first two-thirds to keep people attentive52 \u2014but the endless lists of categories and nominees are interspersed with little entr\u2019actes of musical entertainment. Ms. Dyanna Lauren, for instance, appears between Best-Selling Tape and Best Foreign Release to sing her original composition \u201cPsycho Magnet,\u201d a hard-rock ballad about being a porn star and getting constantly stalked and harassed by mentally ill mooks. The song\u2019s argumentation strikes yr. corresps. as a bit uneven, but Ms. Lauren struts and contorts and punctuates her phrasing with uppercuts to the air like a genuine MTV diva. The downside is that vocally, even with heavy amplification and digital synthesis, Dyanna Lauren sounds like a scalded cat, although Dick Filth points out that so does Alanis Morissette, and H. Hecuba chimes in by shouting: \u201cSay whatever you want about the song-and-dance numbers here, they sure beat what Wahlberg and Reilly were coming up with in Boogie Nights!\u201d\n\nHecuba\u2019s claim seems unassailable until right before the Best Boxcover Concept category, when suddenly a piano is wheeled out for a chinless middle-aged man in the same sort of undersize porkpie that Art Carney always wore in The Honeymooners. This entertainer, who is introduced as \u201cDoctor Dirty\u2014the Dirtiest Musician in the History of Music,\u201d proceeds to belt out obscene parodies of popular ditties that put Table 189 in mind of Mad magazine if everyone at Mad somehow all lost their mind at the same time. \u201cJust got home from prison./My asshole is fizzin\u2019./Goo goo goo drippin\u2019 out my back door\u201d is the only snatch of actual lyrics that persists in memory, though titles like \u201cSit on a Happy Face\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s a Small Dick After All\u201d have proved maddeningly hard to forget. Nobody at or around our table has ever heard of Doctor Dirty before, but almost everyone agrees that he\u2019s the \u201998 gala\u2019s low point and a credible rival for Scotty Schwartz\u2019s 1997 seminude rendition of \u201cThank Heaven for Little Girls\u201d as the most repellent AVNA interlude in modern memory. There\u2019s also the \u201998 ceremony\u2019s climax, in which Midori53 and two other starlets take the stage as \u201cthe Spicy Girls\u201d and do a rappish 4/4 number that ends with pretty much every female porn performer in the crowd54 up on stage dancing lasciviously and blowing kisses at the AVN cameras. This climactic distaff shindig apparently caps the Awards every year.\n\nSomething else happens every year. It\u2019s never part of AVN\u2019s videotape of the gala, but it\u2019s a tradition that finally explains why the ballroom\u2019s poor waiters are willing to spend five hours enduring beverage abuse and scuttling around to find change. After the Awards Show is over and the lights go up, some of the starlets always pose for obscene snapshots with the Forum\u2019s waiters. A lot of this year\u2019s picture-taking happens at the back, right near our table. One waiter stands with his arm around the shoulders of Leanna Hart, who pulls down the starboard side of her strapless taffeta and allows the waiter to cup her right breast while Table 189\u2019s own personal waiter55 snaps the photo. Another waiter goes around behind Ms. Ann Amor\u00e9\u2014a very personable black lady with a 50-inch bust and gang tattoos all down both arms\u2014and hunches over behind her as she bends forward and releases her breasts from confinement, and the waiter paws them and tries to look like he\u2019s having intercourse with her from behind as his friend\u2019s flash goes off. What the waiters are going to do with these photos is unguessable, but they\u2019re visibly thrilled, and the starlets are patient and obliging with them in the same blank, distant way that they were with the mooks at the Adult CES.\n\nTrying to leave after the AAVNAs gala is another slow process, because the broad hallway outside the ballroom is again filled with industry people with Caesar-cameo\u2019d glasses they\u2019ve somehow forgotten to leave at their tables, all standing in clumps and congratulating one another and making plans for various Insider parties later. But the slowest, scariest egressive part is traversing the long glass vestibule to the hotel\u2019s side exit. A mass of fans and Caesars Palace custodians and assorted other civilians are there, and the crowd parts slightly to allow a narrow passage for the Awards\u2019 attendees, who must run this gauntlet nearly single file. It\u2019s late, and everyone\u2019s tired, and this crowd has none of the awestruck reticence of the cabstand\u2019s spectators earlier. Now it\u2019s like every mook has his own special high-volume comment for the passing stars, and there\u2019s a weird mix of adulation and derision:\n\n\u201cLove you, Brittany!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you get that dress on, baby?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook over here!\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes your mother know where you\u2019re at right now?\u201d\n\nOne florid 30ish man holding a plastic cup of beer now reaches out from the crowd and very deliberately pinches the breast of the B-girl walking just in front of us. She slaps his hand away without breaking stride. Because we cannot see her face, we don\u2019t know whether there is any reaction there at all. We have an informed guess, though.\n\nMr. Dick Filth is behind us with one hand on each of yr. corresps.\u2019 shoulders (we\u2019re basically supporting him out).
