"Benjamin Franklin", "lyrics": "The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (Part Two) LyricsLetter from Mr. Abel James, with Notes of my Life\n(received in Paris).\n\n\"MY DEAR AND HONORED FRIEND:  I have often been desirous of writing to thee, but could not be reconciled to the thought that the letter might fall into the hands of the British, lest some printer or busy-body should publish some part of the contents, and give our friend pain, and myself censure.\n\n\"Some time since there fell into my hands, to my great joy, about\ntwenty-three sheets in thy own handwriting, containing an account of the parentage and life of thyself, directed to thy son, ending in the year 1730, with which there were notes, likewise in thy writing; a copy of which I inclose, in hopes it may be a means, if thou continued it up to a later period, that the first and latter part may be put together; and if it is not yet continued, I hope thee will not delay it.  Life is uncertain, as the preacher tells us; and what will the world say if kind, humane, and benevolent Ben.  Franklin should leave his friends and the world deprived of so pleasing and profitable a work; a work which would be useful and entertaining not only to a few, but to millions?  The influence writings under that class have on the minds of youth is very great, and has nowhere appeared to me so plain, as in our public friend's journals.  It almost insensibly leads the youth into the resolution of endeavoring to become as good and eminent as the journalist.  Should thine, for instance, when published (and I think it could not fail of it), lead the youth to equal the industry and temperance of thy early youth, what a blessing with that class would such a work be!  I know of no character living, nor many of them put together, who has so much in his power as thyself to promote a greater spirit of industry and early attention to business, frugality, and temperance with the American youth.  Not that I think the work would have no other merit and use in the world, far from it; but the first is of such vast importance that I know nothing that can equal it.\"\n\n\nThe foregoing letter and the minutes accompanying it being shown to a friend, I received from him the following:\nLetter from Mr. Benjamin Vaughan.\n\"PARIS, January 31, 1783.\n\n\"My DEAREST SIR:  When I had read over your sheets of minutes of the principal incidents of your life, recovered for you by your Quaker acquaintance, I told you I would send you a letter expressing my reasons why I thought it would be useful to complete and publish it as he desired.  Various concerns have for some time past prevented this letter being written, and I do not know whether it was worth any expectation; happening to be at leisure, however, at present, I shall by writing, at least interest and instruct myself; but as the terms I am inclined to use may tend to offend a person of your manners, I shall only tell you how I would address any other person, who was as good and as great as yourself, but less diffident.  I would say to him, Sir, I solicit the history of your life from the following motives:  Your history is so remarkable, that if you do not give it, somebody else will certainly give it; and perhaps so as nearly to do as much harm, as\nyour own management of the thing might do good.  It will moreover present a table of the internal circumstances of your country, which will very much tend to invite to it settlers of virtuous and manly minds.  And considering the eagerness with which such information is sought by them, and the extent of your reputation, I do not know of a more efficacious advertisement than your biography would give.  All that has happened to you is also connected with the detail of the manners and situation of a rising people; and in this respect I do not think that the writings of Caesar and Tacitus can be more interesting to a true judge of human nature and society.  But these, sir, are small reasons, in my opinion, compared with the chance which your life will give for the forming of future great men; and in conjunction with your Art of Virtue (which you design to publish) of improving the features\nof private character, and consequently of aiding all happiness, both\npublic and domestic.  The two works I allude to, sir, will in\nparticular give a noble rule and example of self-education. School and other education constantly proceed upon false principles, and show a clumsy apparatus pointed at a false mark; but your apparatus is simple, and the mark a true one; and while parents and young persons are left destitute of other just means of estimating and becoming prepared for a reasonable course in life, your discovery that the thing is in many a man's private power, will be invaluable!  Influence upon the private character, late in life, is not only an influence late in life, but a weak influence.  It is in youth that we plant our chief habits and prejudices; it is in youth that we take our party as to profession, pursuits and matrimony.  In youth, therefore, the turn is given; in youth the education even of the next generation is given; in youth the private and public character is determined; and the term of life extending but from youth to age, life ought to begin well from youth, and more especially before we take our party as to our principal objects.  But your biography will not merely teach self-education, but the education of a wise man; and the wisest man will receive lights and improve his progress, by seeing detailed the conduct of another wise man.  And why are weaker men to be deprived of such helps, when we see our race has been blundering on in the dark, almost without a guide in\nthis particular, from the farthest trace of time?  Show then, sir, how\nmuch is to be done, both to sons and fathers; and invite all wise men to become like yourself, and other men to become wise. When we see how cruel statesmen and warriors can be to the human race, and how absurd distinguished men can be to their acquaintance, it will be instructive to observe the instances multiply of pacific, acquiescing manners; and to find how compatible it is to be great and domestic, enviable and yet\ngood-humored.\n\n\"The little private incidents which you will also have to relate, will\nhave considerable use, as we want, above all things, rules of prudence in ordinary affairs; and it will be curious to see how you have acted in these.  It will be so far a sort of key to life, and explain many things that all men ought to have once explained to them, to give, them a chance of becoming wise by foresight.  The nearest thing to having experience of one's own, is to have other people's affairs brought before us in a shape that is interesting; this is sure to happen from your pen; our affairs and management will have an air of simplicity or importance that will not fail to strike; and I am convinced you have conducted them with as much originality as if you had been conducting discussions in politics or philosophy; and what more worthy of experiments and system (its importance and its errors considered) than human life?\n\n\"Some men have been virtuous blindly, others have speculated\nfantastically, and others have been shrewd to bad purposes; but you, sir, I am sure, will give under your hand, nothing but what is at the same moment, wise, practical and good, your account of yourself (for I suppose the parallel I am drawing for Dr. Franklin, will hold not only in point of character, but of private history) will show that you are ashamed of no origin; a thing the more important, as you prove how little necessary all origin is to happiness, virtue, or greatness.  As no end likewise happens without a means, so we shall find, sir, that even you yourself framed a plan by which you became considerable; but at the same time we may see that though the event is flattering, the means are as simple as wisdom could make them; that is, depending upon\nnature, virtue, thought and habit. Another thing demonstrated will be the propriety of everyman's waiting for his time for appearing upon the stage of the world.  Our sensations being very much fixed to the moment, we are apt to forget that more moments are to follow the first, and consequently that man should arrange his conduct so as to suit the whole of a life.  Your attribution appears to have been applied to your life, and the passing moments of it have been enlivened with content and enjoyment instead of being tormented with foolish impatience or regrets.  Such a conduct is easy for those who make virtue and themselves in countenance by examples of other truly great men, of whom patience is so often the characteristic.  Your Quaker correspondent, sir (for here again I will suppose the subject of my letter resembling Dr. Franklin), praised your frugality, diligence and temperance, which\nhe considered as a pattern for all youth; but it is singular that he\nshould have forgotten your modesty and your disinterestedness, without which you never could have waited for your advancement, or found your situation in the mean time comfortable; which is a strong lesson to show the poverty of glory and the importance of regulating our minds. If this correspondent had known the nature of your reputation as well as I do, he would have said, Your former writings and measures would secure attention to your Biography, and Art of Virtue; and your Biography and Art of Virtue, in return, would secure attention to them. This is an advantage attendant upon a various character, and which brings all that belongs to it into greater play; and it is the more useful, as perhaps more persons are at a loss for the means of improving their minds and characters, than they are for the time or the inclination to do it.  But there is one concluding reflection, sir, that will shew the use of your life as a mere piece of biography.  This style of writing seems a little gone out of vogue, and yet it is a very useful one; and your specimen of it may be particularly serviceable, as it will make a subject of comparison with the lives of various public\ncutthroats and intriguers, and with absurd monastic self-tormentors or vain literary triflers.  If it encourages more writings of the same kind with your own, and induces more men to spend lives fit to be written, it will be worth all Plutarch's Lives put together.  But being tired of figuring to myself a character of which every feature suits only one man in the world, without giving him the praise of it, I shall end my letter, my dear Dr. Franklin, with a personal application to your proper self.  I am earnestly desirous, then, my dear sir, that you should let the world into the traits of your genuine character, as civil broils may otherwise tend to disguise or traduce it.  Considering your great age, the caution of your character, and your peculiar style of thinking, it is not likely that any one besides yourself can be sufficiently master of the facts of your life, or the intentions of your mind.  Besides all this, the immense revolution of the present period, will necessarily turn our attention towards the author of it, and when virtuous principles have been pretended in it, it will be highly important to shew that such have really influenced; and, as your own character will be the principal one to receive a scrutiny, it is proper (even for its effects upon your vast and rising country, as well as upon England and upon Europe) that it should stand respectable and\neternal.  For the furtherance of human happiness, I have always\nmaintained that it is necessary to prove that man is not even at\npresent a vicious and detestable animal; and still more to prove that good management may greatly amend him; and it is for much the same reason, that I am anxious to see the opinion established, that there are fair characters existing among the individuals of the race; for the moment that all men, without exception, shall be conceived abandoned, good people will cease efforts deemed to be hopeless, and perhaps think of taking their share in the scramble of life, or at least of making it comfortable principally for themselves.  Take then, my dear sir, this work most speedily into hand:  shew yourself good as you are good; temperate as you are temperate; and above all things, prove yourself as one, who from your infancy have loved justice, liberty and concord, in a way that has made it natural and consistent for you to have acted, as we have seen you act in the last seventeen years of your life.  Let Englishmen be made not only to respect, but even to love you.  When they think well of individuals in your native country, they will go nearer to thinking well of your country; and when your countrymen see themselves well thought of by Englishmen, they will go nearer to thinking well of England.  Extend your views even further; do not stop at those who speak the English tongue, but after having settled so many points in nature and politics, think of bettering the whole race of men.  As I have not read any part of the life in question, but know only the character that lived it, I write somewhat at hazard.  I am sure, however, that the life and the treatise I allude to (on the Art of Virtue) will necessarily fulfil the chief of my expectations; and still more so if you take up the measure of suiting these performances to the several views above stated.  Should they even prove unsuccessful in all that a sanguine admirer of yours hopes from them, you will at least have framed pieces to interest the human mind; and whoever gives a feeling of pleasure that is innocent to man, has added so much to the fair side of a life otherwise too much darkened by anxiety and too much injured by pain.  In the hope, therefore, that you will listen to the prayer addressed to you in this letter, I beg to subscribe myself, my dearest sir, etc., etc.,\n\n\"Signed, BENJ. VAUGHAN.\"\nContinuation of the Account of my Life, begun at Passy, near Paris,\n1784.\n\nIt is some time since I receiv'd the above letters, but I have been too busy till now to think of complying with the request they contain. It might, too, be much better done if I were at home among my papers, which would aid my memory, and help to ascertain dates; but my return being uncertain, and having just now a little leisure, I will endeavour to recollect and write what I can; if I live to get home, it may there be corrected and improv'd.\n\nNot having any copy here of what is already written, I know not whether an account is given of the means I used to establish the Philadelphia public library, which, from a small beginning, is now become so considerable, though I remember to have come down to near the time of that transaction (1730). I will therefore begin here with an account of it, which may be struck out if found to have been already given.\n\nAt the time I establish'd myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a good bookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston. In New York and Philad'a the printers were indeed stationers; they sold only paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few common school-books. Those who lov'd reading were obliged to send for their books from England; the members of the Junto had each a few. We had left the alehouse, where we first met, and hired a room to hold our club in. I propos'd that we should all of us bring our books to that room, where they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences, but become a common benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrow such as he wish'd to read at home. This was accordingly done, and for some time contented us.\n\nFinding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd to render the benefit from books more common, by commencing a public subscription library. I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would be necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden, to put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed, by which each subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the first purchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them. So few were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majority of us so poor, that I was not able, with great industry, to find more than fifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay down for this purpose forty shillings each, and ten shillings per annum. On this little fund we began. The books were imported; the library was opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers, on their promissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned. The institution soon manifested its utility, was imitated by other towns, and in other provinces. The libraries were augmented by donations; reading became fashionable; and our people, having no publick amusements to divert their attention from study, became better acquainted with books, and in a few years were observ'd by strangers to be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the same rank generally are in other countries.\n\nWhen we were about to sign the above mentioned articles, which were to be binding on us, our heirs, etc., for fifty years, Mr. Brockden, the scrivener, said to us, \"You are young men, but it is scarcely probable that any of you will live to see the expiration of the term fix'd in the instrument.\" A number of us, however, are yet living; but the instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter that incorporated and gave perpetuity to the company.\n\nThe objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the subscriptions, made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one's self as the proposer of any useful project, that might be suppos'd to raise one's reputation in the smallest degree above that of one's neighbours, when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project. I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and stated it as a scheme of a number of friends, who had requested me to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading. In this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after practis'd it on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes, can heartily recommend it. The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid. If it remains a while uncertain to whom the merit belongs, someone more vain than yourself will be encouraged to claim it, and then even envy will be disposed to do you justice by plucking those assumed feathers, and restoring them to their right owner.\n\nThis library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study, for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair'd in some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me. Reading was the only amusement I allow'd myself. I spent no time in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind; and my industry in my business continu'd as indefatigable as it was necessary. I was indebted for my printing-house; I had a young family coming on to be educated, and I had to contend with for business two printers, who were established in the place before me. My circumstances, however, grew daily easier. My original habits of frugality continuing, and my father having, among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently repeated a proverb of Solomon, \"Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before mean men,\" I from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth and distinction, which encourag'd me, tho' I did not think that I should ever literally stand before kings, which, however, has since happened; for I have stood before five, and even had the honor of sitting down with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner.\n\nWe have an English proverb that says, \"He that would thrive, must ask his wife.\" It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos'd to industry and frugality as myself. She assisted me chearfully in my business, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing old linen rags for the paper-makers, etc., etc. We kept no idle servants, our table was plain and simple, our furniture of the cheapest. For instance, my breakfast was a long time break and milk (no tea), and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer, with a pewter spoon. But mark how luxury will enter families, and make a progress, in spite of principle: being call'd one morning to breakfast, I found it in a China bowl, with a spoon of silver! They had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife, and had cost her the enormous sum of three-and-twenty shillings, for which she had no other excuse or apology to make, but that she thought her husband deserv'd a silver spoon and China bowl as well as any of his neighbors. This was the first appearance of plate and China in our house, which afterward, in a course of years, as our wealth increas'd, augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value.\n\nI had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and though some of the dogmas of that persuasion, such as the eternal decrees of God, election, reprobation, etc., appeared to me unintelligible, others doubtful, and I early absented myself from the public assemblies of the sect, Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that he made the world, and govern'd it by his Providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter. These I esteem'd the essentials of every religion; and, being to be found in all the religions we had in our country, I respected them all, tho' with different degrees of respect, as I found them more or less mix'd with other articles, which, without any tendency to inspire, promote, or confirm morality, serv'd principally to divide us, and make us unfriendly to one another. This respect to all, with an opinion that the worst had some good effects, induc'd me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessen the good opinion another might have of his own religion; and as our province increas'd in people, and new places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary contribution, my mite for such purpose, whatever might be the sect, was never refused.\n\nTho' I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an opinion of its propriety, and of its utility when rightly conducted, and I regularly paid my annual subscription for the support of the only Presbyterian minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia. He us'd to visit me sometimes as a friend, and admonished me to attend his administrations, and I was now and then prevail'd on to do so, once for five Sundays successively. Had he been in my opinion a good preacher, perhaps I might have continued,[65] notwithstanding the occasion I had for the Sunday's leisure in my course of study; but his discourses were chiefly either polemic arguments, or explications of the peculiar doctrines of our sect, and were all to me very dry, uninteresting, and unedifying, since not a single moral principle was inculcated or enforc'd, their aim seeming to be rather to make us Presbyterians than good citizens.\n\nAt length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of Philippians, \"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue, or any praise, think on these things.\" And I imagin'd, in a sermon on such a text, we could not miss of having some morality. But he confin'd himself to five points only, as meant by the apostle, viz.: 1. Keeping holy the Sabbath day. 2. Being diligent in reading the holy Scriptures. 3. Attending duly the publick worship. 4. Partaking of the Sacrament. 5. Paying a due respect to God's ministers. These might be all good things; but, as they were not the kind of good things that I expected from that text, I despaired of ever meeting with them from any other, was disgusted, and attended his preaching no more. I had some years before compos'd a little Liturgy, or form of prayer, for my own private use (viz., in 1728), entitled, Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion. I return'd to the use of this, and went no more to the public assemblies. My conduct might be blameable, but I leave it, without attempting further to excuse it; my present purpose being to relate facts, and not to make apologies for them.\n\nIX\nPLAN FOR ATTAINING MORAL PERFECTION\n\nblock-IT was about this time I conceived the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection. I wish'd to live without committing any fault at any time; I would conquer all that either natural inclination, custom, or company might lead me into. As I knew, or thought I knew, what was right and wrong, I did not see why I might not always do the one and avoid the other. But I soon found I had undertaken a task of more difficulty than I had imagined.[66] While my care was employ'd in guarding against one fault, I was often surprised by another; habit took the advantage of inattention; inclination was sometimes too strong for reason. I concluded, at length, that the mere speculative conviction that it was our interest to be completely virtuous, was not sufficient to prevent our slipping; and that the contrary habits must be broken, and good ones acquired and established, before we can have any dependence on a steady, uniform rectitude of conduct. For this purpose I therefore contrived the following method.\n\nIn the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had met with in my reading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous, as different writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name. Temperance, for example, was by some confined to eating and drinking, while by others it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure, appetite, inclination, or passion, bodily or mental, even to our avarice and ambition. I propos'd to myself, for the sake of clearness, to use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex'd to each, than a few names with more ideas; and I included under thirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurr'd to me as necessary or desirable, and annexed to each a short precept, which fully express'd the extent I gave to its meaning.\n\nThese names of virtues, with their precepts, were:\n\n1. Temperance\n\nEat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.\n\n2. Silence.\n\nSpeak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.\n\n3. Order.\n\nLet all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.\n\n4. Resolution.\n\nResolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.\n\n5. Frugality.\n\nMake no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i. e., waste nothing.\n\n6. Industry.\n\nLose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.\n\n7. Sincerity.\n\nUse no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.\n\n8.

Humility.\n\nImitate Jesus and Socrates.\n\nMy intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues, I judg'd it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when I should be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, till I should have gone thro' the thirteen; and, as the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others, I arrang'd them with that view, as they stand above. Temperance first, as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head, which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept up, and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits, and the force of perpetual temptations. This being acquir'd and establish'd, Silence would be more easy; and my desire being to gain knowledge at the same time that I improv'd in virtue, and considering that in conversation it was obtain'd rather by the use of the ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I was getting into of prattling, punning, and joking, which only made me acceptable to trifling company, I gave Silence the second place. This and the next, Order, I expected would allow me more time for attending to my project and my studies. Resolution, once become habitual, would keep me firm in my endeavours to obtain all the subsequent virtues; Frugality and Industry freeing me from my remaining debt, and producing affluence and independence, would make more easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice, etc., etc. Conceiving then, that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras[67] in his Golden Verses, daily examination would be necessary, I contrived the following method for conducting that examination.\n\nI made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues.[68] I rul'd each page with red ink, so as to have seven columns, one for each day of the week, marking each column with a letter for the day. I cross'd these columns with thirteen red lines, marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a little black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day.\n\nForm of the pages.\nTEMPERANCE.\nEAT NOT TO DULLNESS\nDRINK NOT TO ELEVATION.\nS.\tM.\tT.\tW.\tT.\tF.\tS.\nT.\nS.\t*\t*\t \t*\t \t*\nO.\t*  *\t*\t*\t \t*\t*\t*\nR.\t \t \t*\t \t \t*\nF.\t \t*\t \t \t*\nI.\t \t \t*\nS.\nJ.\nM.\nC.\nT.\nC.\nH.\nJ.\nI determined to give a week's strict attention to each of the virtues successively. Thus, in the first week, my great guard was to avoid every the least offense against Temperance, leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance, only marking every evening the faults of the day. Thus, if in the first week I could keep my first line, marked T, clear of spots, I suppos'd the habit of that virtue so much strengthen'd, and its opposite weaken'd, that I might venture extending my attention to include the next, and for the following week keep both lines clear of spots. Proceeding thus to the last, I could go thro' a course compleat in thirteen weeks, and four courses in a year. And like him who, having a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and his strength, but works on one of the beds at a time, and, having accomplish'd the first, proceeds to a second, so I should have, I hoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress I made in virtue, by clearing successively my lines of their spots, till in the end, by a number of courses, I should be happy in viewing a clean book, after a thirteen weeks' daily examination.\n\nThis my little book had for its motto these lines from Addison's Cato:\n\n\"Here will I hold. If there's a power above us\n(And that there is, all nature cries aloud\nThro' all her works), He must delight in virtue;\nAnd that which he delights in must be happy.\"\nAnother from Cicero,\n\n\"O vit\u00e6 Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix expultrixque vitiorum! Unus dies, bene et ex pr\u00e6ceptis tuis actus, peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus.\"[69]\n\nAnother from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of wisdom or virtue:\n\n\"Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\" iii. 16, 17.\n\nAnd conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I thought it right and necessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it; to this end I formed the following little prayer, which was prefix'd to my tables of examination, for daily use.\n\n\"O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! merciful Guide! Increase in me that wisdom which discovers my truest interest. Strengthen my resolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates. Accept my kind offices to thy other children as the only return in my power for thy continual favours to me.\"\n\nI used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomson's Poems, viz.:\n\n\"Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme!\nO teach me what is good; teach me Thyself!\nSave me from folly, vanity, and vice,\nFrom every low pursuit; and fill my soul\nWith knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure;\nSacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!\"\nThe precept of Order requiring that every part of my business should have its allotted time, one page in my little book contain'd the following scheme of employment for the twenty-four hours of a natural day.\n\nThe Morning.\nQuestion What good shall I do this day?\tpara\t5\tpara\t  Rise, wash, and address Powerfull Goodness! Contrive day's business, and take the resolution of the day: prosecute the present study, and breakfast.\n6\n\n\n\n\n7\n8\tpara\t  Work.\n9\n10\n11\nNoon.\tpara\t12\tpara\t  Read, or overlook my accounts, and dine.\n1\n2\tpara\t  Work.\n3\n4\n5\nEvening\nQuestion.

Music or diversion, or conversation.Examination of the day.\n7\n8\n9\nNight\tpara\t10\tpara\t  Sleep.\n11\n12\n1\n2\n3\n4\nI enter'd upon the execution of this plan for self-examination, and continu'd it with occasional intermissions for some time. I was surpris'd to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined; but I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish. To avoid the trouble of renewing now and then my little book, which, by scraping out the marks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in a new course, became full of holes, I transferr'd my tables and precepts to the ivory leaves of a memorandum book, on which the lines were drawn with red ink, that made a durable stain, and on those lines I mark'd my faults with a black-lead pencil, which marks I could easily wipe out with a wet sponge. After a while I went thro' one course only in a year, and afterward only one in several years, till at length I omitted them entirely, being employ'd in voyages and business abroad, with a multiplicity of affairs that interfered; but I always carried my little book with me.\n\nMy scheme of Order gave me the most trouble;[70] and I found that, tho' it might be practicable where a man's business was such as to leave him the disposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer, for instance, it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master, who must mix with the world, and often receive people of business at their own hours. Order, too, with regard to places for things, papers, etc., I found extreamly difficult to acquire. I had not been early accustomed to it, and, having an exceeding good memory, I was not so sensible of the inconvenience attending want of method. This article, therefore, cost me so much painful attention, and my faults in it vexed me so much, and I made so little progress in amendment, and had such frequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give up the attempt, and content myself with a faulty character in that respect, like the man who, in buying an ax of a smith, my neighbour, desired to have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge. The smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel; he turn'd, while the smith press'd the broad face of the ax hard and heavily on the stone, which made the turning of it very fatiguing. The man came every now and then from the wheel to see how the work went on, and at length would take his ax as it was, without farther grinding. \"No,\" said the smith, \"turn on, turn on; we shall have it bright by-and-by; as yet, it is only speckled.\" \"Yes,\" says the man, \"but I think I like a speckled ax best.\" And I believe this may have been the case with many, who, having, for want of some such means as I employ'd, found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad habits in other points of vice and virtue, have given up the struggle, and concluded that \"a speckled ax was best\"; for something, that pretended to be reason, was every now and then suggesting to me that such extream nicety as I exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals, which, if it were known, would make me ridiculous; that a perfect character might be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and hated; and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself, to keep his friends in countenance.\n\nThe smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel\nIn truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order; and now I am grown old, and my memory bad, I feel very sensibly the want of it. But, on the whole, tho' I never arrived at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been if I had not attempted it; as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies, tho' they never reach the wish'd-for excellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavour, and is tolerable while it continues fair and legible.\n\nIt may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little artifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor ow'd the constant felicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which this is written. What reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of Providence; but, if they arrive, the reflection on past happiness enjoy'd ought to help his bearing them with more resignation. To Temperance he ascribes his long-continued health, and what is still left to him of a good constitution; to Industry and Frugality, the early easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune, with all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful citizen, and obtained for him some degree of reputation among the learned; to Sincerity and Justice, the confidence of his country, and the honorable employs it conferred upon him; and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues,[71] even in the imperfect state he was able to acquire them, all that evenness of temper, and that cheerfulness in conversation, which makes his company still sought for, and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance. I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit.\n\nIt will be remark'd that, tho' my scheme was not wholly without religion, there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets of any particular sect. I had purposely avoided them; for, being fully persuaded of the utility and excellency of my method, and that it might be serviceable to people in all religions, and intending some time or other to publish it, I would not have anything in it that should prejudice anyone, of any sect, against it. I purposed writing a little comment on each virtue, in which I would have shown the advantages of possessing it, and the mischiefs attending its opposite vice; and I should have called my book The Art of Virtue,[72] because it would have shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue, which would have distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good, that does not instruct and indicate the means, but is like the apostle's man of verbal charity, who only without showing to the naked and hungry how or where they might get clothes or victuals, exhorted them to be fed and clothed.\u2014James ii. 15, 16.\n\nBut it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this comment was never fulfilled. I did, indeed, from time to time, put down short hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to be made use of in it, some of which I have still by me; but the necessary close attention to private business in the earlier part of my life, and public business since, have occasioned my postponing it; for, it being connected in my mind with a great and extensive project, that required the whole man to execute, and which an unforeseen succession of employs prevented my attending to, it has hitherto remain'd unfinish'd.\n\nIn this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine, that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden, but forbidden because they are hurtful, the nature of man alone considered; that it was, therefore, everyone's interest to be virtuous who wish'd to be happy even in this world; and I should, from this circumstance (there being always in the world a number of rich merchants, nobility, states, and princes, who have need of honest instruments for the management of their affairs, and such being so rare), have endeavoured to convince young persons that no qualities were so likely to make a poor man's fortune as those of probity and integrity.\n\nMy list of virtues contain'd at first but twelve; but a Quaker friend having kindly informed me that I was generally thought proud; that my pride show'd itself frequently in conversation; that I was not content with being in the right when discussing any point, but was overbearing, and rather insolent, of which he convinc'd me by mentioning several instances; I determined endeavouring to cure myself, if I could, of this vice or folly among the rest, and I added Humility to my list, giving an extensive meaning to the word.\n\nI cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this virtue, but I had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it. I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of others, and all positive assertion of my own. I even forbid myself, agreeably to the old laws of our Junto, the use of every word or expression in the language that imported a fix'd opinion, such as certainly, undoubtedly, etc., and I adopted, instead of them, I conceive, I apprehend, or I imagine a thing to be so or so; or it so appears to me at present. When another asserted something that I thought an error, I deny'd myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition; and in answering I began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present case there appear'd or seem'd to me some difference, etc. I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I engag'd in went on more pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a readier reception and less contradiction; I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail'd with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right.\n\nAnd this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural inclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual to me, that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression escape me. And to this habit (after my character of integrity) I think it principally owing that I had early so much weight with my fellow-citizens when I proposed new institutions, or alterations in the old, and so much influence in public councils when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent, subject to much hesitation in my choice of words, hardly correct in language, and yet I generally carried my points.\n\nIn reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride. Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and will every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it, perhaps, often in this history; for, even if I could conceive that I had compleatly overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.\n\n[Thus far written at Passy, 1784.]\n\n[\"I am now about to write at home, August, 1788, but cannot have the help expected from my papers, many of them being lost in the war. I have, however, found the following.\"][73]\n\nHaving mentioned a great and extensive project which I had conceiv'd, it seems proper that some account should be here given of that project and its object. Its first rise in my mind appears in the following little paper, accidentally preserv'd, viz.:\n\nObservations on my reading history, in Library, May 19th, 1731.\n\n\"That the great affairs of the world, the wars, revolutions, etc., are carried on and effected by parties.\n\n\"That the view of these parties is their present general interest, or what they take to be such.\n\n\"That the different views of these different parties occasion all confusion.\n\n\"That while a party is carrying on a general design, each man has his particular private interest in view.\n\n\"That as soon as a party has gain'd its general point, each member becomes intent upon his particular interest; which, thwarting others, breaks that party into divisions, and occasions more confusion.\n\n\"That few in public affairs act from a mere view of the good of their country, whatever they may pretend; and, tho' their actings bring real good to their country, yet men primarily considered that their own and their country's interest was united, and did not act from a principle of benevolence.\n\n\"That fewer still, in public affairs, act with a view to the good of mankind.\n\n\"There seems to me at present to be great occasion for raising a United Party for Virtue, by forming the virtuous and good men of all nations into a regular body, to be govern'd by suitable good and wise rules, which good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in their obedience to, than common people are to common laws.\n\n\"I at present think that whoever attempts this aright, and is well qualified, cannot fail of pleasing God, and of meeting with success.\n\nB. F.\"\n\nRevolving this project in my mind, as to be undertaken hereafter, when my circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure, I put down from time to time, on pieces of paper, such thoughts as occurr'd to me respecting it. Most of these are lost; but I find one purporting to be the substance of an intended creed, containing, as I thought, the essentials of every known religion, and being free of everything that might shock the professors of any religion. It is express'd in these words, viz.:\n\n\"That there is one God, who made all things.\n\n\"That he governs the world by his providence.\n\n\"That he ought to be worshiped by adoration, prayer, and thanksgiving.\n\n\"But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to man.\n\n\"That the soul is immortal.\n\n\"And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice, either here or hereafter.\"\n\nMy ideas at that time were, that the sect should be begun and spread at first among young and single men only; that each person to be initiated should not only declare his assent to such creed, but should have exercised himself with the thirteen weeks' examination and practice of the virtues, as in the beforemention'd model; that the existence of such a society should be kept a secret, till it was become considerable, to prevent solicitations for the admission of improper persons, but that the members should each of them search among his acquaintance for ingenuous, well-disposed youths, to whom, with prudent caution, the scheme should be gradually communicated; that the members should engage to afford their advice, assistance, and support to each other in promoting one another's interests, business, and advancement in life; that, for distinction, we should be call'd The Society of the Free and Easy: free, as being, by the general practice and habit of the virtues, free from the dominion of vice; and particularly by the practice of industry and frugality, free from debt, which exposes a man to confinement, and a species of slavery to his creditors.\n\nThis is as much as I can now recollect of the project, except that I communicated it in part to two young men, who adopted it with some enthusiasm; but my then narrow circumstances, and the necessity I was under of sticking close to my business, occasioned my postponing the further prosecution of it at that time; and my multifarious occupations, public and private, induc'd me to continue postponing, so that it has been omitted till I have no longer strength or activity left sufficient for such an enterprise; though I am still of opinion that it was a practicable scheme, and might have been very useful, by forming a great number of good citizens; and I was not discourag'd by the seeming magnitude of the undertaking, as I have always thought that one man of tolerable abilities may work great changes, and accomplish great affairs among mankind, if he first forms a good plan, and, cutting off all amusements or other employments that would divert his attention, makes the execution of that same plan his sole study and business.\n\n[66] Compare Philippians iv, 8.\n\n[67] A famous Greek philosopher, who lived about 582-500 B. C. The Golden Verses here ascribed to him are probably of later origin. \"The time which he recommends for this work is about even or bed-time, that we may conclude the action of the day with the judgment of conscience, making the examination of our conversation an evening song to God.\"\n\n[68] This \"little book\" is dated July 1, 1733.\u2014W. T. F.\n\n[69] \"O philosophy, guide of life! O searcher out of virtue and exterminator of vice! One day spent well and in accordance with thy precepts is worth an immortality of sin.\"\u2014Tusculan Inquiries, Book V.\n\n[70] Professor McMaster tells us that when Franklin was American Agent in France, his lack of business order was a source of annoyance to his colleagues and friends. \"Strangers who came to see him were amazed to behold papers of the greatest importance scattered in the most careless way over the table and floor.\"\n\n[71] While there can be no question that Franklin's moral improvement and happiness were due to the practice of these virtues, yet most people will agree that we shall have to go back of his plan for the impelling motive to a virtuous life. Franklin's own suggestion that the scheme smacks of \"foppery in morals\" seems justified. Woodrow Wilson well puts it: \"Men do not take fire from such thoughts, unless something deeper, which is missing here, shine through them. What may have seemed to the eighteenth century a system of morals seems to us nothing more vital than a collection of the precepts of good sense and sound conduct. What redeems it from pettiness in this book is the scope of power and of usefulness to be seen in Franklin himself, who set these standards up in all seriousness and candor for his own life.\" See Galatians, chapter V, for the Christian plan of moral perfection.\n\n[72] Nothing so likely to make a man's fortune as virtue.\u2014Marg. note.\n\n[73] This is a marginal memorandum.\u2014B.\n\nX\n\nPOOR RICHARD'S ALMANAC AND OTHER ACTIVITIES\n\nblock-IN 1732 I first publish'd my Almanack, under the name of Richard Saunders; it was continu'd by me about twenty-five years, commonly call'd Poor Richard's Almanac.[74] I endeavour'd to make it both entertaining and useful, and it accordingly came to be in such demand, that I reap'd considerable profit from it, vending annually near ten thousand. And observing that it was generally read, scarce any neighborhood in the province being without it, I consider'd it as a proper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common people, who bought scarcely any other books; I therefore filled all the little spaces that occurr'd between the remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial sentences, chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality, as the means of procuring wealth, and thereby securing virtue; it being more difficult for a man in want, to act always honestly, as, to use here one of those proverbs, it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright.\n\nThese proverbs, which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations, I assembled and form'd into a connected discourse prefix'd to the Almanack of 1757, as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending an auction. The bringing all these scatter'd councils thus into a focus enabled them to make greater impression. The piece, being universally approved, was copied in all the newspapers of the Continent; reprinted in Britain on a broadside, to be stuck up in houses; two translations were made of it in French, and great numbers bought by the clergy and gentry, to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants. In Pennsylvania, as it discouraged useless expense in foreign superfluities, some thought it had its share of influence in producing that growing plenty of money which was observable for several years after its publication.\n\nTwo pages from Poor Richard's Almanac for 1736. Size of original. Reproduced from a copy at the New York Public Library.\n\nJune page from Poor Richard's Almanac for 1736\tJuly page from Poor Richard's Almanac for 1736\nI considered my newspaper, also, as another means of communicating instruction, and in that view frequently reprinted in it extracts from the Spectator, and other moral writers; and sometimes publish'd little pieces of my own, which had been first composed for reading in our Junto. Of these are a Socratic dialogue, tending to prove that, whatever might be his parts and abilities, a vicious man could not properly be called a man of sense; and a discourse on self-denial, showing that virtue was not secure till its practice became a habitude, and was free from the opposition of contrary inclinations. These may be found in the papers about the beginning of 1735.[75]\n\nIn the conduct of my newspaper, I carefully excluded all libeling and personal abuse, which is of late years become so disgraceful to our country. Whenever I was solicited to insert anything of that kind, and the writers pleaded, as they generally did, the liberty of the press, and that a newspaper was like a stage-coach, in which anyone who would pay had a right to a place, my answer was, that I would print the piece separately if desired, and the author might have as many copies as he pleased to distribute himself, but that I would not take upon me to spread his detraction; and that, having contracted with my subscribers to furnish them with what might be either useful or entertaining, I could not fill their papers with private altercation, in which they had no concern, without doing them manifest injustice. Now, many of our printers make no scruple of gratifying the malice of individuals by false accusations of the fairest characters among ourselves, augmenting animosity even to the producing of duels; and are, moreover, so indiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on the government of neighboring states, and even on the conduct of our best national allies, which may be attended with the most pernicious consequences. These things I mention as a caution to young printers, and that they may be encouraged not to pollute their presses and disgrace their profession by such infamous practices, but refuse steadily, as they may see by my example that such a course of conduct will not, on the whole, be injurious to their interests.\n\nIn 1733 I sent one of my journeymen to Charleston, South Carolina, where a printer was wanting. I furnish'd him with a press and letters, on an agreement of partnership, by which I was to receive one-third of the profits of the business, paying one-third of the expense. He was a man of learning, and honest but ignorant in matters of account; and, tho' he sometimes made me remittances, I could get no account from him, nor any satisfactory state of our partnership while he lived. On his decease, the business was continued by his widow, who, being born and bred in Holland, where, as I have been inform'd, the knowledge of accounts makes a part of female education, she not only sent me as clear a state as she could find of the transactions past, but continued to account with the greatest regularity and exactness every quarter afterwards, and managed the business with such success, that she not only brought up reputably a family of children, but, at the expiration of the term, was able to purchase of me the printing-house, and establish her son in it.\n\nI mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branch of education for our young females, as likely to be of more use to them and their children, in case of widowhood, than either music or dancing, by preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men, and enabling them to continue, perhaps, a profitable mercantile house, with establish'd correspondence, till a son is grown up fit to undertake and go on with it, to the lasting advantage and enriching of the family.\n\nAbout the year 1734 there arrived among us from Ireland a young Presbyterian preacher, named Hemphill, who delivered with a good voice, and apparently extempore, most excellent discourses, which drew together considerable numbers of different persuasions, who join'd in admiring them. Among the rest, I became one of his constant hearers, his sermons pleasing me, as they had little of the dogmatical kind, but inculcated strongly the practice of virtue, or what in the religious stile are called good works. Those, however, of our congregation, who considered themselves as orthodox Presbyterians, disapprov'd his doctrine, and were join'd by most of the old clergy, who arraign'd him of heterodoxy before the synod, in order to have him silenc'd. I became his zealous partisan, and contributed all I could to raise a party in his favour, and we combated for him awhile with some hopes of success. There was much scribbling pro and con upon the occasion; and finding that, tho' an elegant preacher, he was but a poor writer, I lent him my pen and wrote for him two or three pamphlets, and one piece in the Gazette of April, 1735. Those pamphlets, as is generally the case with controversial writings, tho' eagerly read at the time, were soon out of vogue, and I question whether a single copy of them now exists.[76]\n\nDuring the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly. One of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that was much admired, thought he had somewhere read the sermon before, or at least a part of it. On search, he found that part quoted at length, in one of the British Reviews, from a discourse of Dr. Foster's.[77] This detection gave many of our party disgust, who accordingly abandoned his cause, and occasion'd our more speedy discomfiture in the synod. I stuck by him, however, as I rather approv'd his giving us good sermons composed by others, than bad ones of his own manufacture, tho' the latter was the practice of our common teachers. He afterward acknowledg'd to me that none of those he preach'd were his own; adding, that his memory was such as enabled him to retain and repeat any sermon after one reading only. On our defeat, he left us in search elsewhere of better fortune, and I quitted the congregation, never joining it after, tho' I continu'd many years my subscription for the support of its ministers.\n\nI had begun in 1733 to study languages; I soon made myself so much a master of the French as to be able to read the books with ease. I then undertook the Italian. An acquaintance, who was also learning it, us'd often to tempt me to play chess with him. Finding this took up too much of the time I had to spare for study, I at length refus'd to play any more, unless on this condition, that the victor in every game should have a right to impose a task, either in parts of the grammar to be got by heart, or in translations, etc., which tasks the vanquish'd was to perform upon honour, before our next meeting. As we play'd pretty equally, we thus beat one another into that language. I afterwards with a little painstaking, acquir'd as much of the Spanish as to read their books also.\n\nI have already mention'd that I had only one year's instruction in a Latin school, and that when very young, after which I neglected that language entirely. But, when I had attained an acquaintance with the French, Italian, and Spanish, I was surpris'd to find, on looking over a Latin Testament, that I understood so much more of that language than I had imagined, which encouraged me to apply myself again to the study of it, and I met with more success, as those preceding languages had greatly smooth'd my way.\n\nFrom these circumstances, I have thought that there is some inconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages. We are told that it is proper to begin first with the Latin, and, having acquir'd that, it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are deriv'd from it; and yet we do not begin with the Greek, in order more easily to acquire the Latin. It is true that, if you can clamber and get to the top of a staircase without using the steps, you will more easily gain them in descending; but certainly, if you begin with the lowest you will with more ease ascend to the top; and I would therefore offer it to the consideration of those who superintend the education of our youth, whether, since many of those who begin with the Latin quit the same after spending some years without having made any great proficiency, and what they have learnt becomes almost useless, so that their time has been lost, it would not have been better to have begun with the French, proceeding to the Italian, etc.; for, tho', after spending the same time, they should quit the study of languages and never arrive at the Latin, they would, however, have acquired another tongue or two, that, being in modern use, might be serviceable to them in common life.[78]\n\nAfter ten years' absence from Boston, and having become easy in my circumstances, I made a journey thither to visit my relations, which I could not sooner well afford. In returning, I call'd at Newport to see my brother, then settled there with his printing-house. Our former differences were forgotten, and our meeting was very cordial and affectionate. He was fast declining in his health, and requested of me that, in case of his death, which he apprehended not far distant, I would take home his son, then but ten years of age, and bring him up to the printing business. This I accordingly perform'd, sending him a few years to school before I took him into the office. His mother carried on the business till he was grown up, when I assisted him with an assortment of new types, those of his father being in a manner worn out. Thus it was that I made my brother ample amends for the service I had depriv'd him of by leaving him so early.\n\nOur former differences were forgotten, and our meeting was very cordial and affectionate\nIn 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the small-pox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.\n\nOur club, the Junto, was found so useful, and afforded such satisfaction to the members, that several were desirous of introducing their friends, which could not well be done without exceeding what we had settled as a convenient number, viz., twelve. We had from the beginning made it a rule to keep our institution a secret, which was pretty well observ'd; the intention was to avoid applications of improper persons for admittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might find it difficult to refuse. I was one of those who were against any addition to our number, but, instead of it, made in writing a proposal, that every member separately should endeavour to form a subordinate club, with the same rules respecting queries, etc., and without informing them of the connection with the Junto. The advantages proposed were, the improvement of so many more young citizens by the use of our institutions; our better acquaintance with the general sentiments of the inhabitants on any occasion, as the Junto member might propose what queries we should desire, and was to report to the Junto what pass'd in his separate club; the promotion of our particular interests in business by more extensive recommendation, and the increase of our influence in public affairs, and our power of doing good by spreading thro' the several clubs the sentiments of the Junto.\n\nThe project was approv'd, and every member undertook to form his club, but they did not all succeed. Five or six only were compleated, which were called by different names, as the Vine, the Union, the Band, etc. They were useful to themselves, and afforded us a good deal of amusement, information, and instruction, besides answering, in some considerable degree, our views of influencing the public opinion on particular occasions, of which I shall give some instances in course of time as they happened.\n\nMy first promotion was my being chosen, in 1736, clerk of the General Assembly. The choice was made that year without opposition; but the year following, when I was again propos'd (the choice, like that of the members, being annual), a new member made a long speech against me, in order to favour some other candidate. I was, however, chosen, which was the more agreeable to me, as, besides the pay for the immediate service as clerk, the place gave me a better opportunity of keeping up an interest among the members, which secur'd to me the business of printing the votes, laws, paper money, and other occasional jobbs for the public, that, on the whole, were very profitable.\n\nI therefore did not like the opposition of this new member, who was a gentleman of fortune and education, with talents that were likely to give him, in time, great influence in the House, which, indeed, afterwards happened. I did not, however, aim at gaining his favour by paying any servile respect to him, but, after some time, took this other method. Having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire of perusing that book, and requesting he would do me the favour of lending it to me for a few days. He sent it immediately, and I return'd it in about a week with another note, expressing strongly my sense of the favour. When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had never done before), and with great civility; and he ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became great friends, and our friendship continued to his death. This is another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which says, \"He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.\" And it shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove, than to resent, return, and continue inimical proceedings.\n\nIn 1737, Colonel Spotswood, late governor of Virginia, and then postmaster-general, being dissatisfied with the conduct of his deputy at Philadelphia, respecting some negligence in rendering, and inexactitude of his accounts, took from him the commission and offered it to me. I accepted it readily, and found it of great advantage; for, tho' the salary was small, it facilitated the correspondence that improv'd my newspaper, increas'd the number demanded, as well as the advertisements to be inserted, so that it came to afford me a considerable income. My old competitor's newspaper declin'd proportionately, and I was satisfy'd without retaliating his refusal, while postmaster, to permit my papers being carried by the riders. Thus he suffer'd greatly from his neglect in due accounting; and I mention it as a lesson to those young men who may be employ'd in managing affairs for others, that they should always render accounts, and make remittances, with great clearness and punctuality. The character of observing such a conduct is the most powerful of all recommendations to new employments and increase of business.\n\n[74] The almanac at that time was a kind of periodical as well as a guide to natural phenomena and the weather.

But these schools may assume the merit of teaching all that they pretend to teach, the Latin and Greek languages.'\"\u2014Bigelow.\n\nXI\n\nINTEREST IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS\n\nblock-IBEGAN now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs, beginning, however, with small matters. The city watch was one of the first things that I conceiv'd to want regulation. It was managed by the constables of the respective wards in turn; the constable warned a number of housekeepers to attend him for the night. Those who chose never to attend, paid him six shillings a year to be excus'd, which was suppos'd to be for hiring substitutes, but was, in reality, much more than was necessary for that purpose, and made the constableship a place of profit; and the constable, for a little drink, often got such ragamuffins about him as a watch, that respectable housekeepers did not choose to mix with. Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected, and most of the nights spent in tippling. I thereupon wrote a paper to be read in Junto, representing these irregularities, but insisting more particularly on the inequality of this six-shilling tax of the constables, respecting the circumstances of those who paid it, since a poor widow housekeeper, all whose property to be guarded by the watch did not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid as much as the wealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds' worth of goods in his stores.\n\nOn the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the hiring of proper men to serve constantly in that business; and as a more equitable way of supporting the charge, the levying a tax that should be proportion'd to the property. This idea, being approv'd by the Junto, was communicated to the other clubs, but as arising in each of them; and though the plan was not immediately carried into execution, yet, by preparing the minds of people for the change, it paved the way for the law obtained a few years after, when the members of our clubs were grown into more influence.\n\nAbout this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in Junto, but it was afterward publish'd) on the different accidents and carelessnesses by which houses were set on fire, with cautions against them, and means proposed of avoiding them. This was much spoken of as a useful piece, and gave rise to a project, which soon followed it, of forming a company for the more ready extinguishing of fires, and mutual assistance in removing and securing of goods when in danger. Associates in this scheme were presently found, amounting to thirty. Our articles of agreement oblig'd every member to keep always in good order, and fit for use, a certain number of leather buckets, with strong bags and baskets (for packing and transporting of goods), which were to be brought to every fire; and we agreed to meet once a month and spend a social evening together, in discoursing and communicating such ideas as occurred to us upon the subjects of fires, as might be useful in our conduct on such occasions.\n\nThe utility of this institution soon appeared, and many more desiring to be admitted than we thought convenient for one company, they were advised to form another, which was accordingly done; and this went on, one new company being formed after another, till they became so numerous as to include most of the inhabitants who were men of property; and now, at the time of my writing this, tho' upward of fifty years since its establishment, that which I first formed, called the Union Fire Company, still subsists and flourishes, tho' the first members are all deceas'd but myself and one, who is older by a year than I am. The small fines that have been paid by members for absence at the monthly meetings have been apply'd to the purchase of fire-engines, ladders, fire-hooks, and other useful implements for each company, so that I question whether there is a city in the world better provided with the means of putting a stop to beginning conflagrations; and, in fact, since these institutions, the city has never lost by fire more than one or two houses at a time, and the flames have often been extinguished before the house in which they began has been half consumed.\n\nthe flames have often been extinguished\nIn 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr. Whitefield,[79] who had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher. He was at first permitted to preach in some of our churches; but the clergy, taking a dislike to him, soon refus'd him their pulpits, and he was oblig'd to preach in the fields. The multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous, and it was matter of speculation to me, who was one of the number, to observe the extraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers, and how much they admir'd and respected him, notwithstanding his common abuse of them, by assuring them they were naturally half beasts and half devils. It was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants. From being thoughtless or indifferent about religion, it seem'd as if all the world were growing religious, so that one could not walk thro' the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families of every street.\n\nAnd it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air, subject to its inclemencies, the building of a house to meet in was no sooner propos'd, and persons appointed to receive contributions, but sufficient sums were soon receiv'd to procure the ground and erect the building, which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad, about the size of Westminster Hall;[80] and the work was carried on with such spirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than could have been expected. Both house and ground were vested in trustees, expressly for the use of any preacher of any religious persuasion who might desire to say something to the people at Philadelphia; the design in building not being to accommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants in general; so that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service.\n\nMr. Whitefield, in leaving us, went preaching all the way thro' the colonies to Georgia. The settlement of that province had lately been begun, but, instead of being made with hardy, industrious husbandmen, accustomed to labour, the only people fit for such an enterprise, it was with families of broken shop-keepers and other insolvent debtors, many of indolent and idle habits, taken out of the jails, who, being set down in the woods, unqualified for clearing land, and unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement, perished in numbers, leaving many helpless children unprovided for. The sight of their miserable situation inspir'd the benevolent heart of Mr. Whitefield with the idea of building an Orphan House there, in which they might be supported and educated. Returning northward, he preach'd up this charity, and made large collections, for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the hearts and purses of his hearers, of which I myself was an instance.\n\nI did not disapprove of the design, but, as Georgia was then destitute of materials and workmen, and it was proposed to send them from Philadelphia at a great expense, I thought it would have been better to have built the house here, and brought the children to it. This I advis'd; but he was resolute in his first project, rejected my counsel, and I therefore refus'd to contribute. I happened soon after to attend one of his sermons, in the course of which I perceived he intended to finish with a collection, and I silently resolved he should get nothing from me. I had in my pocket a handful of copper money, three or four silver dollars, and five pistoles in gold. As he proceeded I began to soften, and concluded to give the coppers. Another stroke of his oratory made me asham'd of that, and determin'd me to give the silver; and he finish'd so admirably, that I empty'd my pocket wholly into the collector's dish, gold and all. At this sermon there was also one of our club, who, being of my sentiments respecting the building in Georgia, and suspecting a collection might be intended, had, by precaution, emptied his pockets before he came from home. Towards the conclusion of the discourse, however, he felt a strong desire to give, and apply'd to a neighbour who stood near him, to borrow some money for the purpose. The application was unfortunately [made] to perhaps the only man in the company who had the firmness not to be affected by the preacher. His answer was, \"At any other time, Friend Hopkinson, I would lend to thee freely; but not now, for thee seems to be out of thy right senses.\"\n\nSome of Mr. Whitefield's enemies affected to suppose that he would apply these collections to his own private emolument; but I, who was intimately acquainted with him (being employed in printing his Sermons and Journals, etc.), never had the least suspicion of his integrity, but am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct a perfectly honest man; and methinks my testimony in his favour ought to have the more weight, as we had no religious connection. He us'd, indeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion, but never had the satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard. Ours was a mere civil friendship, sincere on both sides, and lasted to his death.\n\nThe following instance will show something of the terms on which we stood. Upon one of his arrivals from England at Boston, he wrote to me that he should come soon to Philadelphia, but knew not where he could lodge when there, as he understood his old friend and host, Mr. Benezet was removed to Germantown. My answer was, \"You know my house; if you can make shift with its scanty accommodations, you will be most heartily welcome.\" He reply'd, that if I made that kind offer for Christ's sake, I should not miss of a reward. And I returned, \"Don't let me be mistaken; it was not for Christ's sake, but for your sake.\" One of our common acquaintance jocosely remark'd, that, knowing it to be the custom of the saints, when they received any favour, to shift the burden of the obligation from off their own shoulders, and place it in heaven, I had contriv'd to fix it on earth.\n\nThe last time I saw Mr. Whitefield was in London, when he consulted me about his Orphan House concern, and his purpose of appropriating it to the establishment of a college.\n\nHe had a loud and clear voice, and articulated his words and sentences so perfectly, that he might be heard and understood at a great distance, especially as his auditories, however numerous, observ'd the most exact silence. He preach'd one evening from the top of the Courthouse steps, which are in the middle of Market-street, and on the west side of Second-street, which crosses it at right angles. Both streets were fill'd with his hearers to a considerable distance. Being among the hindmost in Market-street, I had the curiosity to learn how far he could be heard, by retiring backwards down the street towards the river; and I found his voice distinct till I came near Front-street, when some noise in that street obscur'd it. Imagining then a semicircle, of which my distance should be the radius, and that it were fill'd with auditors, to each of whom I allow'd two square feet, I computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty thousand. This reconcil'd me to the newspaper accounts of his having preach'd to twenty-five thousand people in the fields, and to the ancient histories of generals haranguing whole armies, of which I had sometimes doubted.\n\nBy hearing him often, I came to distinguish easily between sermons newly compos'd, and those which he had often preach'd in the course of his travels. His delivery of the latter was so improv'd by frequent repetitions that every accent, every emphasis, every modulation of voice, was so perfectly well turn'd and well plac'd, that, without being interested in the subject, one could not help being pleas'd with the discourse; a pleasure of much the same kind with that receiv'd from an excellent piece of musick. This is an advantage itinerant preachers have over those who are stationary, as the latter cannot well improve their delivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals.\n\nHis writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage to his enemies; unguarded expressions, and even erroneous opinions, delivered in preaching, might have been afterwards explain'd or qualifi'd by supposing others that might have accompani'd them, or they might have been deny'd; but litera scripta manet. Critics attack'd his writings violently, and with so much appearance of reason as to diminish the number of his votaries and prevent their increase; so that I am of opinion if he had never written anything, he would have left behind him a much more numerous and important sect, and his reputation might in that case have been still growing, even after his death, as there being nothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give him a lower character, his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign for him as great a variety of excellences as their enthusiastic admiration might wish him to have possessed.\n\nMy business was now continually augmenting, and my circumstances growing daily easier, my newspaper having become very profitable, as being for a time almost the only one in this and the neighbouring provinces. I experienced, too, the truth of the observation, \"that after getting the first hundred pound, it is more easy to get the second,\" money itself being of a prolific nature.\n\nThe partnership at Carolina having succeeded, I was encourag'd to engage in others, and to promote several of my workmen, who had behaved well, by establishing them with printing-houses in different colonies, on the same terms with that in Carolina. Most of them did well, being enabled at the end of our term, six years, to purchase the types of me and go on working for themselves, by which means several families were raised. Partnerships often finish in quarrels; but I was happy in this, that mine were all carried on and ended amicably, owing, I think, a good deal to the precaution of having very explicitly settled, in our articles, everything to be done by or expected from each partner, so that there was nothing to dispute, which precaution I would therefore recommend to all who enter into partnerships; for, whatever esteem partners may have for, and confidence in each other at the time of the contract, little jealousies and disgusts may arise, with ideas of inequality in the care and burden of the business, etc., which are attended often with breach of friendship and of the connection, perhaps with lawsuits and other disagreeable consequences.\n\n[79] George Whitefield, pronounced Hwit'field (1714-1770), a celebrated English clergyman and pulpit orator, one of the founders of Methodism.\n\n[80] A part of the palace of Westminster, now forming the vestibule to the Houses of Parliament in London.\n\nXII\n\nDEFENSE OF THE PROVINCE\n\nblock-IHAD, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with my being established in Pennsylvania. There were, however, two, things that I regretted, there being no provision for defense, nor for a compleat education of youth; no militia, nor any college. I therefore, in 1743, drew up a proposal for establishing an academy; and at that time, thinking the Reverend Mr. Peters, who was out of employ, a fit person to superintend such an institution, I communicated the project to him; but he, having more profitable views in the service of the proprietaries, which succeeded, declin'd the undertaking; and, not knowing another at that time suitable for such a trust, I let the scheme lie awhile dormant. I succeeded better the next year, 1744, in proposing and establishing a Philosophical Society. The paper I wrote for that purpose will be found among my writings, when collected.\n\nWith respect to defense, Spain having been several years at war against Great Britain, and being at length join'd by France, which brought us into great danger; and the laboured and long-continued endeavour of our governor, Thomas, to prevail with our Quaker Assembly to pass a militia law, and make other provisions for the security of the province, having proved abortive, I determined to try what might be done by a voluntary association of the people. To promote this, I first wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled Plain Truth, in which I stated our defenceless situation in strong lights, with the necessity of union and discipline for our defense, and promis'd to propose in a few days an association, to be generally signed for that purpose. The pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect. I was call'd upon for the instrument of association, and having settled the draft of it with a few friends, I appointed a meeting of the citizens in the large building before mentioned. The house was pretty full; I had prepared a number of printed copies, and provided pens and ink dispers'd all over the room. I harangued them a little on the subject, read the paper, and explained it, and then distributed the copies, which were eagerly signed, not the least objection being made.\n\nWhen the company separated, and the papers were collected, we found above twelve hundred hands; and, other copies being dispersed in the country, the subscribers amounted at length to upward of ten thousand. These all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms, formed themselves into companies and regiments, chose their own officers, and met every week to be instructed in the manual exercise, and other parts of military discipline. The women, by subscriptions among themselves, provided silk colours, which they presented to the companies, painted with different devices and mottos, which I supplied.\n\nOne of the flags of the Pennsylvania Association, 1747.

Designed by Franklin and made by the women of Philadelphia.\nThe officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia regiment, being met, chose me for their colonel; but, conceiving myself unfit, I declin'd that station, and recommended Mr. Lawrence, a fine person, and man of influence, who was accordingly appointed. I then propos'd a lottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town, and furnishing it with cannon. It filled expeditiously, and the battery was soon erected, the merlons being fram'd of logs and fill'd with earth. We bought some old cannon from Boston, but, these not being sufficient, we wrote to England for more, soliciting, at the same time, our proprietaries for some assistance, tho' without much expectation of obtaining it.\n\nMeanwhile, Colonel Lawrence, William Allen, Abram Taylor, Esqr., and myself were sent to New York by the associators, commission'd to borrow some cannon of Governor Clinton. He at first refus'd us peremptorily; but at dinner with his council, where there was great drinking of Madeira wine, as the custom of that place then was, he softened by degrees, and said he would lend us six. After a few more bumpers he advanc'd to ten; and at length he very good-naturedly conceded eighteen. They were fine cannon, eighteen-pounders, with their carriages, which we soon transported and mounted on our battery, where the associators kept a nightly guard while the war lasted, and among the rest I regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier.\n\nI regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier\n\"I regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier\"\nMy activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and council; they took me into confidence, and I was consulted by them in every measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the association. Calling in the aid of religion, I propos'd to them the proclaiming a fast, to promote reformation, and implore the blessing of Heaven on our undertaking. They embrac'd the motion; but, as it was the first fast ever thought of in the province, the secretary had no precedent from which to draw the proclamation. My education in New England, where a fast is proclaimed every year, was here of some advantage: I drew it in the accustomed stile, it was translated into German,[81] printed in both languages, and divulg'd thro' the province. This gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing their congregations to join in the association, and it would probably have been general among all but Quakers if the peace had not soon interven'd.\n\nIt was thought by some of my friends that, by my activity in these affairs, I should offend that sect, and thereby lose my interest in the Assembly of the province, where they formed a great majority. A young gentleman who had likewise some friends in the House, and wished to succeed me as their clerk, acquainted me that it was decided to displace me at the next election; and he, therefore, in good will, advis'd me to resign, as more consistent with my honour than being turn'd out. My answer to him was, that I had read or heard of some public man who made it a rule never to ask for an office, and never to refuse one when offer'd to him. \"I approve,\" says I, \"of his rule, and will practice it with a small addition; I shall never ask, never refuse, nor ever resign an office. If they will have my office of clerk to dispose of to another, they shall take it from me. I will not, by giving it up, lose my right of some time or other making reprisals on my adversaries.\" I heard, however, no more of this; I was chosen again unanimously as usual at the next election. Possibly, as they dislik'd my late intimacy with the members of council, who had join'd the governors in all the disputes about military preparations, with which the House had long been harass'd, they might have been pleas'd if I would voluntarily have left them; but they did not care to displace me on account merely of my zeal for the association, and they could not well give another reason.\n\nIndeed I had some cause to believe that the defense of the country was not disagreeable to any of them, provided they were not requir'd to assist in it. And I found that a much greater number of them than I could have imagined, tho' against offensive war, were clearly for the defensive. Many pamphlets pro and con were publish'd on the subject, and some by good Quakers, in favour of defense, which I believe convinc'd most of their younger people.\n\nA transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their prevailing sentiments. It had been propos'd that we should encourage the scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock, then about sixty pounds, in tickets of the lottery. By our rules, no money could be dispos'd of till the next meeting after the proposal. The company consisted of thirty members, of which twenty-two were Quakers, and eight only of other persuasions. We eight punctually attended the meeting; but, tho' we thought that some of the Quakers would join us, we were by no means sure of a majority. Only one Quaker, Mr. James Morris, appear'd to oppose the measure. He expressed much sorrow that it had ever been propos'd, as he said Friends were all against it, and it would create such discord as might break up the company. We told him that we saw no reason for that; we were the minority, and if Friends were against the measure, and outvoted us, we must and should, agreeably to the usage of all societies, submit. When the hour for business arriv'd it was mov'd to put the vote; he allow'd we might then do it by the rules, but, as he could assure us that a number of members intended to be present for the purpose of opposing it, it would be but candid to allow a little time for their appearing.\n\nWhile we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen below desir'd to speak with me. I went down, and found they were two of our Quaker members. They told me there were eight of them assembled at a tavern just by; that they were determin'd to come and vote with us if there should be occasion, which they hop'd would not be the case, and desir'd we would not call for their assistance if we could do without it, as their voting for such a measure might embroil them with their elders and friends. Being thus secure of a majority, I went up, and after a little seeming hesitation, agreed to a delay of another hour. This Mr. Morris allow'd to be extreamly fair. Not one of his opposing friends appear'd, at which he express'd great surprize; and, at the expiration of the hour, we carri'd the resolution eight to one; and as, of the twenty-two Quakers, eight were ready to vote with us, and thirteen, by their absence, manifested that they were not inclin'd to oppose the measure, I afterward estimated the proportion of Quakers sincerely against defense as one to twenty-one only; for these were all regular members of that society, and in good reputation among them, and had due notice of what was propos'd at that meeting.\n\nThe honorable and learned Mr. Logan, who had always been of that sect, was one who wrote an address to them, declaring his approbation of defensive war, and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments. He put into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for the battery, with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn wholly to that service. He told me the following anecdote of his old master, William Penn, respecting defense. He came over from England, when a young man, with that proprietary, and as his secretary. It was war-time, and their ship was chas'd by an armed vessel, suppos'd to be an enemy. Their captain prepar'd for defense; but told William Penn, and his company of Quakers, that he did not expect their assistance, and they might retire into the cabin, which they did, except James Logan,[82] who chose to stay upon deck, and was quarter'd to a gun. The suppos'd enemy prov'd a friend, so there was no fighting; but when the secretary went down to communicate the intelligence, William Penn rebuk'd him severely for staying upon deck, and undertaking to assist in defending the vessel, contrary to the principles of Friends, especially as it had not been required by the captain. This reproof, being before all the company, piqu'd the secretary, who answer'd, \"I being thy servant, why did thee not order me to come down? But thee was willing enough that I should stay and help to fight the ship when thee thought there was danger.\"\n\nMy being many years in the Assembly, the majority of which were constantly Quakers, gave me frequent opportunities of seeing the embarrassment given them by their principle against war, whenever application was made to them, by order of the crown, to grant aids for military purposes. They were unwilling to offend government, on the one hand, by a direct refusal; and their friends, the body of the Quakers, on the other, by compliance contrary to their principles; hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying, and modes of disguising the compliance when it became unavoidable. The common mode at last was, to grant money under the phrase of its being \"for the king's use,\" and never to inquire how it was applied.\n\nBut, if the demand was not directly from the crown, that phrase was found not so proper, and some other was to be invented. As, when powder was wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg), and the government of New England solicited a grant of some from Pennsylvania, which was much urg'd on the House by Governor Thomas, they could not grant money to buy powder, because that was an ingredient of war; but they voted an aid to New England of three thousand pounds, to be put into the hands of the governor, and appropriated it for the purchasing of bread, flour, wheat or other grain. Some of the council, desirous of giving the House still further embarrassment, advis'd the governor not to accept provision, as not being the thing he had demanded; but he repli'd, \"I shall take the money, for I understand very well their meaning; other grain is gunpowder,\" which he accordingly bought, and they never objected to it.[83]\n\nIt was in allusion to this fact that, when in our fire company we feared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery, and I had said to my friend Mr. Syng, one of our members, \"If we fail, let us move the purchase of a fire-engine with the money; the Quakers can have no objection to that; and then, if you nominate me and I you as a committee for that purpose, we will buy a great gun, which is certainly a fire-engine.\" \"I see,\" says he, \"you have improv'd by being so long in the Assembly; your equivocal project would be just a match for their wheat or other grain.\"\n\nThese embarrassments that the Quakers suffer'd from having establish'd and published it as one of their principles that no kind of war was lawful, and which, being once published, they could not afterwards, however they might change their minds, easily get rid of, reminds me of what I think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us, that of the Dunkers. I was acquainted with one of its founders, Michael Welfare, soon after it appear'd. He complain'd to me that they were grievously calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions, and charg'd with abominable principles and practices to which they were utter strangers. I told him this had always been the case with new sects, and that, to put a stop to such abuse, I imagin'd it might be well to publish the articles of their belief, and the rules of their discipline. He said that it had been propos'd among them, but not agreed to, for this reason: \"When we were first drawn together as a society,\" says he, \"it had pleased God to enlighten our minds so far as to see that some doctrines, which we once esteemed truths, were errors; and that others, which we had esteemed errors, were real truths. >From time to time He has been pleased to afford us farther light, and our principles have been improving, and our errors diminishing. Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression, and at the perfection of spiritual or theological knowledge; and we fear that, if we should once print our confession of faith, we should feel ourselves as if bound and confin'd by it, and perhaps be unwilling to receive further improvement, and our successors still more so, as conceiving what we their elders and founders had done, to be something sacred, never to be departed from.\"\n\nThis modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history of mankind, every other sect supposing itself in possession of all truth, and that those who differ are so far in the wrong; like a man traveling in foggy weather, those at some distance before him on the road he sees wrapped up in the fog, as well as those behind him, and also the people in the fields on each side, but near him all appears clear, tho' in truth he is as much in the fog as any of them. To avoid this kind of embarrassment, the Quakers have of late years been gradually declining the public service in the Assembly and in the magistracy, choosing rather to quit their power than their principle.\n\nIn order of time, I should have mentioned before, that having, in 1742, invented an open stove[84] for the better warming of rooms, and at the same time saving fuel, as the fresh air admitted was warmed in entering, I made a present of the model to Mr. Robert Grace, one of my early friends, who, having an iron-furnace,[85] found the casting of the plates for these stoves a profitable thing, as they were growing in demand. To promote that demand, I wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled \"An Account of the new-invented Pennsylvania Fireplaces; wherein their Construction and Manner of Operation is particularly explained; their Advantages above every other Method of warming Rooms demonstrated; and all Objections that have been raised against the Use of them answered and obviated,\" etc. This pamphlet had a good effect. Gov'r. Thomas was so pleas'd with the construction of this stove, as described in it, that he offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them for a term of years; but I declin'd it from a principle which has ever weighed with me on such occasions, viz., That, as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.\n\nAn ironmonger in London however, assuming a good deal of my pamphlet, and working it up into his own, and making some small changes in the machine, which rather hurt its operation, got a patent for it there, and made, as I was told, a little fortune by it. And this is not the only instance of patents taken out for my inventions by others, tho' not always with the same success, which I never contested, as having no desire of profiting by patents myself, and hating disputes. The use of these fireplaces in very many houses, both of this and the neighbouring colonies, has been, and is, a great saving of wood to the inhabitants.\n\n[81] Wm. Penn's agents sought recruits for the colony of Pennsylvania in the low countries of Germany, and there are still in eastern Pennsylvania many Germans, inaccurately called Pennsylvania Dutch. Many of them use a Germanized English.\n\n[82] James Logan (1674-1751) came to America with William Penn in 1699, and was the business agent for the Penn family.

The first step I took was to associate in the design a number of active friends, of whom the Junto furnished a good part; the next was to write and publish a pamphlet, entitled Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania. This I distributed among the principal inhabitants gratis; and as soon as I could suppose their minds a little prepared by the perusal of it, I set on foot a subscription for opening and supporting an academy; it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five years; by so dividing it, I judg'd the subscription might be larger, and I believe it was so, amounting to no less, if I remember right, than five thousand pounds.\n\nIn the introduction to these proposals, I stated their publication, not as an act of mine, but of some publick-spirited gentlemen, avoiding as much as I could, according to my usual rule, the presenting myself to the publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit.\n\nThe subscribers, to carry the project into immediate execution, chose out of their number twenty-four trustees, and appointed Mr. Francis,[86] then attorney-general, and myself to draw up constitutions for the government of the academy; which being done and signed, a house was hired, masters engag'd, and the schools opened, I think, in the same year, 1749.\n\nThe scholars increasing fast, the house was soon found too small, and we were looking out for a piece of ground, properly situated, with intention to build, when Providence threw into our way a large house ready built, which, with a few alterations, might well serve our purpose. This was the building before mentioned, erected by the hearers of Mr. Whitefield, and was obtained for us in the following manner.\n\nIt is to be noted that the contributions to this building being made by people of different sects, care was taken in the nomination of trustees, in whom the building and ground was to be vested, that a predominancy should not be given to any sect, lest in time that predominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the use of such sect, contrary to the original intention. It was therefore that one of each sect was appointed, viz., one Church-of-England man, one Presbyterian, one Baptist, one Moravian, etc., those, in case of vacancy by death, were to fill it by election from among the contributors. The Moravian happen'd not to please his colleagues, and on his death they resolved to have no other of that sect. The difficulty then was, how to avoid having two of some other sect, by means of the new choice.\n\nSeveral persons were named, and for that reason not agreed to. At length one mention'd me, with the observation that I was merely an honest man, and of no sect at all, which prevailed with them to chuse me. The enthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long since abat'd, and its trustees had not been able to procure fresh contributions for paying the ground-rent, and discharging some other debts the building had occasion'd, which embarrass'd them greatly. Being now a member of both sets of trustees, that for the building and that for the academy, I had a good opportunity of negotiating with both, and brought them finally to an agreement, by which the trustees for the building were to cede it to those of the academy, the latter undertaking to discharge the debt, to keep forever open in the building a large hall for occasional preachers, according to the original intention, and maintain a free-school for the instruction of poor children. Writings were accordingly drawn, and on paying the debts the trustees of the academy were put in possession of the premises; and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories, and different rooms above and below for the several schools, and purchasing some additional ground, the whole was soon made fit for our purpose, and the scholars remov'd into the building. The care and trouble of agreeing with the workmen, purchasing materials, and superintending the work, fell upon me; and I went thro' it the more cheerfully, as it did not then interfere with my private business, having the year before taken a very able, industrious, and honest partner, Mr. David Hall, with whose character I was well acquainted, as he had work'd for me four years. He took off my hands all care of the printing-office, paying me punctually my share of the profits. The partnership continued eighteen years, successfully for us both.\n\nThe trustees of the academy, after a while, were incorporated by a charter from the governor; their funds were increas'd by contributions in Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries, to which the Assembly has since made considerable addition; and thus was established the present University of Philadelphia.[87] I have been continued one of its trustees from the beginning, now near forty years, and have had the very great pleasure of seeing a number of the youth who have receiv'd their education in it, distinguish'd by their improv'd abilities, serviceable in public stations, and ornaments to their country.\n\nWhen I disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from private business, I flatter'd myself that, by the sufficient tho' moderate fortune I had acquir'd, I had secured leisure during the rest of my life for philosophical studies and amusements. I purchased all Dr. Spence's apparatus, who had come from England to lecture here, and I proceeded in my electrical experiments with great alacrity; but the publick, now considering me as a man of leisure, laid hold of me for their purposes, every part of our civil government, and almost at the same time, imposing some duty upon me. The governor put me into the commission of the peace; the corporation of the city chose me of the common council, and soon after an alderman; and the citizens at large chose me a burgess to represent them in Assembly. This latter station was the more agreeable to me, as I was at length tired with sitting there to hear debates, in which, as clerk, I could take no part, and which were often so unentertaining that I was induc'd to amuse myself with making magic squares or circles, or anything to avoid weariness; and I conceiv'd my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doing good. I would not, however, insinuate that my ambition was not flatter'd by all these promotions; it certainly was; for, considering my low beginning, they were great things to me; and they were still more pleasing, as being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion, and by me entirely unsolicited.\n\nThe office of justice of the peace I try'd a little, by attending a few courts, and sitting on the bench to hear causes; but finding that more knowledge of the common law than I possess'd was necessary to act in that station with credit, I gradually withdrew from it, excusing myself by my being oblig'd to attend the higher duties of a legislator in the Assembly. My election to this trust was repeated every year for ten years, without my ever asking any elector for his vote, or signifying, either directly or indirectly, any desire of being chosen. On taking my seat in the House, my son was appointed their clerk.\n\nThe year following, a treaty being to be held with the Indians at Carlisle, the governor sent a message to the House, proposing that they should nominate some of their members, to be join'd with some members of council, as commissioners for that purpose.[88] The House named the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself; and, being commission'd, we went to Carlisle, and met the Indians accordingly.\n\nAs those people are extreamly apt to get drunk, and, when so, are very quarrelsome and disorderly, we strictly forbad the selling any liquor to them; and when they complain'd of this restriction, we told them that if they would continue sober during the treaty, we would give them plenty of rum when business was over. They promis'd this, and they kept their promise, because they could get no liquor, and the treaty was conducted very orderly, and concluded to mutual satisfaction. They then claim'd and received the rum; this was in the afternoon: they were near one hundred men, women, and children, and were lodg'd in temporary cabins, built in the form of a square, just without the town. In the evening, hearing a great noise among them, the commissioners walk'd out to see what was the matter. We found they had made a great bonfire in the middle of the square; they were all drunk, men and women, quarreling and fighting. Their dark-colour'd bodies, half naked, seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire, running after and beating one another with firebrands, accompanied by their horrid yellings, form'd a scene the most resembling our ideas of hell that could well be imagin'd; there was no appeasing the tumult, and we retired to our lodging. At midnight a number of them came thundering at our door, demanding more rum, of which we took no notice.\n\nThe next day, sensible they had misbehav'd in giving us that disturbance, they sent three of their old counselors to make their apology. The orator acknowledg'd the fault, but laid it upon the rum; and then endeavoured to excuse the rum by saying, \"The Great Spirit, who made all things, made everything for some use, and whatever use he design'd anything for, that use it should always be put to. Now, when he made rum, he said, 'Let this be for the Indians to get drunk with,' and it must be so.\" And, indeed, if it be the design of Providence to extirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the earth, it seems not improbable that rum may be the appointed means. It has already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the sea-coast.\n\nIn the evening, hearing a great noise among them, the commissioners walk'd out to see what was the matter\n\"In the evening, hearing a great noise among them, the commissioners walk'd out to see what was the matter\"\nIn 1751, Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine, conceived the idea of establishing a hospital in Philadelphia (a very beneficent design, which has been ascrib'd to me, but was originally his), for the reception and cure of poor sick persons, whether inhabitants of the province or strangers. He was zealous and active in endeavouring to procure subscriptions for it, but the proposal being a novelty in America, and at first not well understood, he met but with small success.\n\nAt length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was no such thing as carrying a public-spirited project through without my being concern'd in it. \"For,\" says he, \"I am often ask'd by those to whom I propose subscribing, Have you consulted Franklin upon this business? And what does he think of it? And when I tell them that I have not (supposing it rather out of your line), they do not subscribe, but say they will consider of it.\" I enquired into the nature and probable utility of his scheme, and receiving from him a very satisfactory explanation, I not only subscrib'd to it myself, but engag'd heartily in the design of procuring subscriptions from others. Previously, however, to the solicitation, I endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers, which was my usual custom in such cases, but which he had omitted.\n\nThe subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous; but, beginning to flag, I saw they would be insufficient without some assistance from the Assembly, and therefore propos'd to petition for it, which was done. The country members did not at first relish the project; they objected that it could only be serviceable to the city, and therefore the citizens alone should be at the expense of it; and they doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approv'd of it. My allegation on the contrary, that it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of our being able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations, they considered as a most extravagant supposition, and utterly impossible.\n\nOn this I form'd my plan; and, asking leave to bring in a bill for incorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their petition, and granting them a blank sum of money, which leave was obtained chiefly on the consideration that the House could throw the bill out if they did not like it, I drew it so as to make the important clause a conditional one, viz., \"And be it enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that when the said contributors shall have met and chosen their managers and treasurer, and shall have raised by their contributions a capital stock of\u2014\u2014value (the yearly interest of which is to be applied to the accommodating of the sick poor in the said hospital, free of charge for diet, attendance, advice, and medicines), and shall make the same appear to the satisfaction of the speaker of the Assembly for the time being, that then it shall and may be lawful for the said speaker, and he is hereby required, to sign an order on the provincial treasurer for the payment of two thousand pounds, in two yearly payments, to the treasurer of the said hospital, to be applied to the founding, building, and finishing of the same.\"\n\nThis condition carried the bill through; for the members, who had oppos'd the grant, and now conceiv'd they might have the credit of being charitable without the expense, agreed to its passage; and then, in soliciting subscriptions among the people, we urg'd the conditional promise of the law as an additional motive to give, since every man's donation would be doubled; thus the clause work'd both ways. The subscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum, and we claim'd and receiv'd the public gift, which enabled us to carry the design into execution. A convenient and handsome building was soon erected; the institution has by constant experience been found useful, and flourishes to this day; and I do not remember any of my political manoeuvers, the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure, or wherein, after thinking of it, I more easily excus'd myself for having made some use of cunning.\n\nIt was about this time that another projector, the Rev. Gilbert Tennent[89], came to me with a request that I would assist him in procuring a subscription for erecting a new meeting-house. It was to be for the use of a congregation he had gathered among the Presbyterians, who were originally disciples of Mr. Whitefield. Unwilling to make myself disagreeable to my fellow-citizens by too frequently soliciting their contributions, I absolutely refus'd. He then desired I would furnish him with a list of the names of persons I knew by experience to be generous and public-spirited. I thought it would be unbecoming in me, after their kind compliance with my solicitations, to mark them out to be worried by other beggars, and therefore refus'd also to give such a list. He then desir'd I would at least give him my advice. \"That I will readily do,\" said I; \"and, in the first place, I advise you to apply to all those whom you know will give something; next, to those whom you are uncertain whether they will give anything or not, and show them the list of those who have given; and, lastly, do not neglect those who you are sure will give nothing, for in some of them you may be mistaken.\" He laugh'd and thank'd me, and said he would take my advice. He did so, for he ask'd of everybody, and he obtain'd a much larger sum than he expected, with which he erected the capacious and very elegant meeting-house that stands in Arch-street.\n\nOur city, tho' laid out with a beautiful regularity, the streets large, straight, and crossing each other at right angles, had the disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpav'd, and in wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages plough'd them into a quagmire, so that it was difficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dust was offensive. I had liv'd near what was call'd the Jersey Market, and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions. A strip of ground down the middle of that market was at length pav'd with brick, so that, being once in the market, they had firm footing, but were often over shoes in dirt to get there. By talking and writing on the subject, I was at length instrumental in getting the street pav'd with stone between the market and the brick'd foot-pavement, that was on each side next the houses. This, for some time, gave an easy access to the market dry-shod; but, the rest of the street not being pav'd, whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement, it shook off and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon cover'd with mire, which was not remov'd, the city as yet having no scavengers.\n\nAfter some inquiry, I found a poor, industrious man, who was willing to undertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twice a week, carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours' doors, for the sum of sixpence per month, to be paid by each house. I then wrote and printed a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that might be obtain'd by this small expense; the greater ease in keeping our houses clean, so much dirt not being brought in by people's feet; the benefit to the shops by more custom, etc., etc., as buyers could more easily get at them; and by not having, in windy weather, the dust blown in upon their goods, etc., etc. I sent one of these papers to each house, and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe an agreement to pay these sixpences; it was unanimously sign'd, and for a time well executed. All the inhabitants of the city were delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market, it being a convenience to all, and this rais'd a general desire to have all the streets paved, and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose.\n\nAfter some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and brought it into the Assembly. It was just before I went to England, in 1757, and did not pass till I was gone,[90] and then with an alteration in the mode of assessment, which I thought not for the better, but with an additional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets, which was a great improvement. It was by a private person, the late Mr. John Clifton, his giving a sample of the utility of lamps, by placing one at his door, that the people were first impress'd with the idea of enlighting all the city. The honour of this public benefit has also been ascrib'd to me, but it belongs truly to that gentleman. I did but follow his example, and have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps, as differing from the globe lamps we were at first supply'd with from London. Those we found inconvenient in these respects: they admitted no air below; the smoke, therefore, did not readily go out above, but circulated in the globe, lodg'd on its inside, and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford; giving, besides, the daily trouble of wiping them clean; and an accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it, and render it totally useless. I therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes, with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke, and crevices admitting air below, to facilitate the ascent of the smoke; by this means they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours, as the London lamps do, but continu'd bright till morning, and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane, easily repair'd.\n\nI have sometimes wonder'd that the Londoners did not, from the effect holes in the bottom of the globe lamps us'd at Vauxhall[91] have in keeping them clean, learn to have such holes in their street lamps. But, these holes being made for another purpose, viz., to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro' them, the other use, of letting in air, seems not to have been thought of; and therefore, after the lamps have been lit a few hours, the streets of London are very poorly illuminated.\n\nThe mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I propos'd, when in London, to Dr. Fothergill, who was among the best men I have known, and a great promoter of useful projects. I had observ'd that the streets, when dry, were never swept, and the light dust carried away; but it was suffer'd to accumulate till wet weather reduc'd it to mud, and then, after lying some days so deep on the pavement that there was no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms, it was with great labour rak'd together and thrown up into carts open above, the sides of which suffered some of the slush at every jolt on the pavement to shake out and fall, sometimes to the annoyance of foot-passengers. The reason given for not sweeping the dusty streets was that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses.\n\na poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom\nAn accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be done in a little time. I found at my door in Craven-street,[92] one morning, a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom; she appeared very pale and feeble, as just come out of a fit of sickness. I ask'd who employ'd her to sweep there; she said, \"Nobody, but I am very poor and in distress, and I sweeps before gentle-folkses doors, and hopes they will give me something.\" I bid her sweep the whole street clean, and I would give her a shilling; this was at nine o'clock; at 12 she came for the shilling. From the slowness I saw at first in her working, I could scarce believe that the work was done so soon, and sent my servant to examine it, who reported that the whole street was swept perfectly clean, and all the dust plac'd in the gutter, which was in the middle; and the next rain wash'd it quite away, so that the pavement and even the kennel were perfectly clean.\n\nI then judg'd that, if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in three hours, a strong, active man might have done it in half the time. And here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in such a narrow street, running down its middle, instead of two, one on each side, near the footway; for where all the rain that falls on a street runs from the sides and meets in the middle, it forms there a current strong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with; but when divided into two channels, it is often too weak to cleanse either, and only makes the mud it finds more fluid, so that the wheels of carriages and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the foot-pavement, which is thereby rendered foul and slippery, and sometimes splash it upon those who are walking. My proposal, communicated to the good doctor, was as follows:\n\n\"For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets of London and Westminster, it is proposed that the several watchmen be contracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons, and the mud rak'd up at other times, each in the several streets and lanes of his round; that they be furnish'd with brooms and other proper instruments for these purposes, to be kept at their respective stands, ready to furnish the poor people they may employ in the service.\n\n\"That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps at proper distances, before the shops and windows of houses are usually opened, when the scavengers, with close-covered carts, shall also carry it all away.\n\n\"That the mud, when rak'd up, be not left in heaps to be spread abroad again by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses, but that the scavengers be provided with bodies of carts, not plac'd high upon wheels, but low upon sliders, with lattice bottoms, which, being cover'd with straw, will retain the mud thrown into them, and permit the water to drain from it, whereby it will become much lighter, water making the greatest part of its weight; these bodies of carts to be plac'd at convenient distances, and the mud brought to them in wheelbarrows; they remaining where plac'd till the mud is drain'd, and then horses brought to draw them away.\"\n\nI have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of this proposal, on account of the narrowness of some streets, and the difficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as not to encumber too much the passage; but I am still of opinion that the former, requiring the dust to be swept up and carry'd away before the shops are open, is very practicable in the summer, when the days are long; for, in walking thro' the Strand and Fleet-street one morning at seven o'clock, I observ'd there was not one shop open, tho' it had been daylight and the sun up above three hours; the inhabitants of London chusing voluntarily to live much by candle-light, and sleep by sunshine, and yet often complain, a little absurdly, of the duty on candles, and the high price of tallow.\n\nSome may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating; but when they consider that tho' dust blown into the eyes of a single person, or into a single shop on a windy day, is but of small importance, yet the great number of the instances in a populous city, and its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence, perhaps they will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature. Human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day. Thus, if you teach a poor young man to shave himself, and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas. The money may be soon spent, the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it; but in the other case, he escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers, and of their sometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths, and dull razors; he shaves when most convenient to him, and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument. With these sentiments I have hazarded the few preceding pages, hoping they may afford hints which some time or other may be useful to a city I love, having lived many years in it very happily, and perhaps to some of our towns in America.\n\nHaving been for some time employed by the postmaster-general of America as his comptroller in regulating several offices, and bringing the officers to account, I was, upon his death in 1753, appointed, jointly with Mr. William Hunter, to succeed him, by a commission from the postmaster-general in England. The American office never had hitherto paid anything to that of Britain. We were to have six hundred pounds a year between us, if we could make that sum out of the profits of the office. To do this, a variety of improvements were necessary; some of these were inevitably at first expensive, so that in the first four years the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us. But it soon after began to repay us; and before I was displac'd by a freak of the ministers, of which I shall speak hereafter, we had brought it to yield three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the post-office of Ireland. Since that imprudent transaction, they have receiv'd from it\u2014not one farthing!\n\nThe business of the post-office occasion'd my taking a journey this year to New England, where the College of Cambridge, of their own motion, presented me with the degree of Master of Arts. Yale College, in Connecticut, had before made me a similar compliment. Thus, without studying in any college, I came to partake of their honours.

Governor Hamilton, having receiv'd this order, acquainted the House with it, requesting they would furnish proper presents for the Indians, to be given on this occasion; and naming the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr. Secretary Peters as commissioners to act for Pennsylvania. The House approv'd the nomination, and provided the goods for the present, and tho' they did not much like treating out of the provinces; and we met the other commissioners at Albany about the middle of June.\n\nIn our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the union of all the colonies under one government, so far as might be necessary for defense, and other important general purposes. As we pass'd thro' New York, I had there shown my project to Mr. James Alexander and Mr. Kennedy, two gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs, and, being fortified by their approbation, I ventur'd to lay it before the Congress. It then appeared that several of the commissioners had form'd plans of the same kind. A previous question was first taken, whether a union should be established, which pass'd in the affirmative unanimously. A committee was then appointed, one member from each colony, to consider the several plans and report. Mine happen'd to be preferr'd, and, with a few amendments, was accordingly reported.\n\nJOIN or DIE.\nBy this plan the general government was to be administered by a president-general, appointed and supported by the crown, and a grand council was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of the several colonies, met in their respective assemblies. The debates upon it in Congress went on daily, hand in hand with the Indian business. Many objections and difficulties were started, but at length they were all overcome, and the plan was unanimously agreed to, and copies ordered to be transmitted to the Board of Trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces. Its fate was singular; the assemblies did not adopt it, as they all thought there was too much prerogative in it, and in England it was judg'd to have too much of the democratic. The Board of Trade therefore did not approve of it, nor recommend it for the approbation of his majesty; but another scheme was form'd, supposed to answer the same purpose better, whereby the governors of the provinces, with some members of their respective councils, were to meet and order the raising of troops, building of forts, etc., and to draw on the treasury of Great Britain for the expense, which was afterwards to be refunded by an act of Parliament laying a tax on America. My plan, with my reasons in support of it, is to be found among my political papers that are printed.\n\nBeing the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation with Governor Shirley upon both the plans. Part of what passed between us on the occasion may also be seen among those papers. The different and contrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was really the true medium; and I am still of opinion it would have been happy for both sides the water if it had been adopted. The colonies, so united, would have been sufficiently strong to have defended themselves; there would then have been no need of troops from England; of course, the subsequent pretence for taxing America, and the bloody contest it occasioned, would have been avoided. But such mistakes are not new; history is full of the errors of states and princes.\n\n\"Look round the habitable world, how few\nKnow their own good, or, knowing it, pursue!\"\nThose who govern, having much business on their hands, do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects. The best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom, but forc'd by the occasion.\n\nThe Governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the Assembly, expressed his approbation of the plan, \"as appearing to him to be drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment, and therefore recommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious attention.\" The House, however, by the management of a certain member, took it up when I happen'd to be absent, which I thought not very fair, and reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all, to my no small mortification.\n\nXV\n\nQUARRELS WITH THE PROPRIETARY GOVERNORS\n\nblock-IN my journey to Boston this year, I met at New York with our new governor, Mr. Morris, just arriv'd there from England, with whom I had been before intimately acquainted. He brought a commission to supersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tir'd with the disputes his proprietary instructions subjected him to, had resign'd. Mr. Morris ask'd me if I thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration. I said, \"No; you may, on the contrary, have a very comfortable one, if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute with the Assembly.\" \"My dear friend,\" says he, pleasantly, \"how can you advise my avoiding disputes? You know I love disputing; it is one of my greatest pleasures; however, to show the regard I have for your counsel, I promise you I will, if possible, avoid them.\" He had some reason for loving to dispute, being eloquent, an acute sophister, and, therefore, generally successful in argumentative conversation. He had been brought up to it from a boy, his father, as I have heard, accustoming his children to dispute with one another for his diversion, while sitting at table after dinner; but I think the practice was not wise; for, in the course of my observation, these disputing, contradicting, and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs. They get victory sometimes, but they never get good will, which would be of more use to them. We parted, he going to Philadelphia, and I to Boston.\n\nIn returning, I met at New York with the votes of the Assembly, by which it appear'd that, notwithstanding his promise to me, he and the House were already in high contention; and it was a continual battle between them as long as he retain'd the government. I had my share of it; for, as soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly, I was put on every committee for answering his speeches and messages, and by the committees always desired to make the drafts. Our answers, as well as his messages, were often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive; and, as he knew I wrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined that, when we met, we could hardly avoid cutting throats; but he was so good-natur'd a man that no personal difference between him and me was occasion'd by the contest, and we often din'd together.\n\nOne afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in the street\nOne afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in the street. \"Franklin,\" says he, \"you must go home with me and spend the evening; I am to have some company that you will like;\" and, taking me by the arm, he led me to his house. In gay conversation over our wine, after supper, he told us, jokingly, that he much admir'd the idea of Sancho Panza,[93] who, when it was proposed to give him a government, requested it might be a government of blacks, as then, if he could not agree with his people, he might sell them. One of his friends, who sat next to me, says, \"Franklin, why do you continue to side with these damn'd Quakers? Had not you better sell them? The proprietor would give you a good price.\" \"The governor,\" says I, \"has not yet blacked them enough.\" He, indeed, had laboured hard to blacken the Assembly in all his messages, but they wip'd off his colouring as fast as he laid it on, and plac'd it, in return, thick upon his own face; so that, finding he was likely to be negrofied himself, he, as well as Mr. Hamilton, grew tir'd of the contest, and quitted the government.\n\nThese public quarrels[94] were all at bottom owing to the proprietaries, our hereditary governors, who, when any expense was to be incurred for the defense of their province, with incredible meanness instructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary taxes, unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly excused; and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observe such instructions. The Assemblies for three years held out against this injustice, tho' constrained to bend at last. At length Captain Denny, who was Governor Morris's successor, ventured to disobey those instructions; how that was brought about I shall show hereafter.\n\nBut I am got forward too fast with my story: there are still some transactions to be mention'd that happened during the administration of Governor Morris.\n\nWar being in a manner commenced with France, the government of Massachusetts Bay projected an attack upon Crown Point,[95] and sent Mr. Quincy to Pennsylvania, and Mr. Pownall, afterward Governor Pownall, to New York, to solicit assistance. As I was in the Assembly, knew its temper, and was Mr. Quincy's countryman, he appli'd to me for my influence and assistance. I dictated his address to them, which was well received. They voted an aid of ten thousand pounds, to be laid out in provisions. But the governor refusing his assent to their bill (which included this with other sums granted for the use of the crown), unless a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate from bearing any part of the tax that would be necessary, the Assembly, tho' very desirous of making their grant to New England effectual, were at a loss how to accomplish it. Mr. Quincy labored hard with the governor to obtain his assent, but he was obstinate.\n\nI then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor, by orders on the trustees of the Loan office, which, by law, the Assembly had the right of drawing. There was, indeed, little or no money at that time in the office, and therefore I propos'd that the orders should be payable in a year, and to bear an interest of five per cent. With these orders I suppos'd the provisions might easily be purchas'd. The Assembly, with very little hesitation, adopted the proposal. The orders were immediately printed, and I was one of the committee directed to sign and dispose of them. The fund for paying them was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the province upon loan, together with the revenue arising from the excise, which being known to be more than sufficient, they obtain'd instant credit, and were not only receiv'd in payment for the provisions, but many money'd people, who had cash lying by them, vested it in those orders, which they found advantageous, as they bore interest while upon hand, and might on any occasion be used as money; so that they were eagerly all bought up, and in a few weeks none of them were to be seen. Thus this important affair was by my means completed. Mr. Quincy return'd thanks to the Assembly in a handsome memorial, went home highly pleas'd with this success of his embassy, and ever after bore for me the most cordial and affectionate friendship.\n\n[93] The \"round, selfish, and self-important\" squire of Don Quixote in Cervantes' romance of that name.\n\n[94] My acts in Morris's time, military, etc.\u2014Marg. note.\n\n[95] On Lake Champlain, ninety miles north of Albany.

It was finally captured from the English by the Americans in 1775.\n\nXVI\n\nBRADDOCK'S EXPEDITION\n\nblock-THE British government, not chusing to permit the union of the colonies as propos'd at Albany, and to trust that union with their defense, lest they should thereby grow too military, and feel their own strength, suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain'd of them, sent over General Braddock with two regiments of regular English troops for that purpose. He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia, and thence march'd to Frederictown, in Maryland, where he halted for carriages. Our Assembly apprehending, from some information, that he had conceived violent prejudices against them, as averse to the service, wish'd me to wait upon him, not as from them, but as postmaster-general, under the guise of proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors of the several provinces, with whom he must necessarily have continual correspondence, and of which they propos'd to pay the expense. My son accompanied me on this journey.\n\nWe found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently for the return of those he had sent thro' the back parts of Maryland and Virginia to collect waggons. I stayed with him several days, din'd with him daily, and had full opportunity of removing all his prejudices, by the information of what the Assembly had before his arrival actually done, and were still willing to do, to facilitate his operations. When I was about to depart, the returns of waggons to be obtained were brought in, by which it appear'd that they amounted only to twenty-five, and not all of those were in serviceable condition. The general and all the officers were surpris'd, declar'd the expedition was then at an end, being impossible, and exclaim'd against the ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute of the means of conveying their stores, baggage, etc., not less than one hundred and fifty waggons being necessary.\n\nI happen'd to say I thought it was pity they had not been landed rather in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost every farmer had his waggon. The general eagerly laid hold of my words, and said, \"Then you, sir, who are a man of interest there, can probably procure them for us; and I beg you will undertake it.\" I ask'd what terms were to be offer'd the owners of the waggons, and I was desir'd to put on paper the terms that appeared to me necessary. This I did, and they were agreed to, and a commission and instructions accordingly prepar'd immediately. What those terms were will appear in the advertisement I publish'd as soon as I arriv'd at Lancaster, which being, from the great and sudden effect it produc'd, a piece of some curiosity, I shall insert it at length, as follows:\n\n\"Advertisement.\n\"Lancaster, April 26, 1755.\n\n\"Whereas, one hundred and fifty waggons, with four horses to each waggon, and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses, are wanted for the service of his majesty's forces now about to rendezvous at Will's Creek, and his excellency General Braddock having been pleased to empower me to contract for the hire of the same, I hereby give notice that I shall attend for that purpose at Lancaster from this day to next Wednesday evening, and at York from next Thursday morning till Friday evening, where I shall be ready to agree for waggons and teams, or single horses, on the following terms, viz.: 1. That there shall be paid for each waggon, with four good horses and a driver, fifteen shillings per diem; and for each able horse with a pack-saddle, or other saddle and furniture, two shillings per diem; and for each able horse without a saddle, eighteen pence per diem. 2. That the pay commence from the time of their joining the forces at Will's Creek, which must be on or before the 20th of May ensuing, and that a reasonable allowance be paid over and above for the time necessary for their travelling to Will's Creek and home again after their discharge. 3. Each waggon and team, and every saddle or pack horse, is to be valued by indifferent persons chosen between me and the owner; and in case of the loss of any waggon, team, or other horse in the service, the price according to such valuation is to be allowed and paid. 4. Seven days' pay is to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the owner of each waggon and team, or horse, at the time of contracting, if required, and the remainder to be paid by General Braddock, or by the paymaster of the army, at the time of their discharge, or from time to time, as it shall be demanded. 5. No drivers of waggons, or persons taking care of the hired horses, are on any account to be called upon to do the duty of soldiers, or be otherwise employed than in conducting or taking care of their carriages or horses. 6. All oats, Indian corn, or other forage that waggons or horses bring to the camp, more than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses, is to be taken for the use of the army, and a reasonable price paid for the same.\n\n\"Note.\u2014My son, William Franklin, is empowered to enter into like contracts with any person in Cumberland county.\n\n\"B. Franklin.\"\n\n\"To the inhabitants of the Counties of Lancaster, York, and Cumberland.\n\"Friends and Countrymen,\n\n\"Being occasionally[96] at the camp at Frederic a few days since, I found the general and officers extremely exasperated on account of their not being supplied with horses and carriages, which had been expected from this province, as most able to furnish them; but, through the dissensions between our governor and Assembly, money had not been provided, nor any steps taken for that purpose.\n\n\"It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties, to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted, and compel as many persons into the service as would be necessary to drive and take care of them.\n\n\"I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through these counties on such an occasion, especially considering the temper they are in, and their resentment against us, would be attended with many and great inconveniences to the inhabitants, and therefore more willingly took the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair and equitable means. The people of these back counties have lately complained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting; you have an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very considerable sum; for, if the service of this expedition should continue, as it is more than probable it will, for one hundred and twenty days, the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to upward of thirty thousand pounds, which will be paid you in silver and gold of the king's money.\n\n\"The service will be light and easy, for the army will scarce march above twelve miles per day, and the waggons and baggage-horses, as they carry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare of the army, must march with the army, and no faster; and are, for the army's sake, always placed where they can be most secure, whether in a march or in a camp.\n\n\"If you are really, as I believe you are, good and loyal subjects to his majesty, you may now do a most acceptable service, and make it easy to yourselves; for three or four of such as cannot separately spare from the business of their plantations a waggon and four horses and a driver, may do it together, one furnishing the waggon, another one or two horses, and another the driver, and divide the pay proportionately between you; but if you do not this service to your king and country voluntarily, when such good pay and reasonable terms are offered to you, your loyalty will be strongly suspected. The king's business must be done; so many brave troops, come so far for your defense, must not stand idle through your backwardness to do what may be reasonably expected from you; waggons and horses must be had; violent measures will probably be used, and you will be left to seek for a recompense where you can find it, and your case, perhaps, be little pitied or regarded.\n\n\"I have no particular interest in this affair, as, except the satisfaction of endeavouring to do good, I shall have only my labour for my pains. If this method of obtaining the waggons and horses is not likely to succeed, I am obliged to send word to the general in fourteen days; and I suppose Sir John St. Clair, the hussar, with a body of soldiers, will immediately enter the province for the purpose, which I shall be sorry to hear, because I am very sincerely and truly your friend and well-wisher,\n\n\"B. Franklin.\"\n\nI received of the general about eight hundred pounds, to be disbursed in advance-money to the waggon owners, etc.; but that sum being insufficient, I advanc'd upward of two hundred pounds more, and in two weeks the one hundred and fifty waggons, with two hundred and fifty-nine carrying horses, were on their march for the camp. The advertisement promised payment according to the valuation, in case any waggon or horse should be lost. The owners, however, alleging they did not know General Braddock, or what dependence might be had on his promise, insisted on my bond for the performance, which I accordingly gave them.\n\nWhile I was at the camp, supping one evening with the officers of Colonel Dunbar's regiment, he represented to me his concern for the subalterns, who, he said, were generally not in affluence, and could ill afford, in this dear country, to lay in the stores that might be necessary in so long a march, thro' a wilderness, where nothing was to be purchas'd. I commiserated their case, and resolved to endeavour procuring them some relief. I said nothing, however, to him of my intention, but wrote the next morning to the committee of the Assembly, who had the disposition of some public money, warmly recommending the case of these officers to their consideration, and proposing that a present should be sent them of necessaries and refreshments. My son, who had some experience of a camp life, and of its wants, drew up a list for me, which I enclos'd in my letter. The committee approv'd, and used such diligence that, conducted by my son, the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons. They consisted of twenty parcels, each containing\n\n6 lbs. loaf sugar.\t1 Gloucester cheese.\n6 lbs. good Muscovado do.\t1 kegg containing 20 lbs. good butter.\n1 lb. good green tea.\t2 doz. old Madeira wine.\n1 lb. good bohea do.\t2 gallons Jamaica spirits.\n6 lbs. good ground coffee.\t1 bottle flour of mustard.\n6 lbs. chocolate.\t2 well-cur'd hams.\n1-2 cwt. best white biscuit.\t1-2 dozen dry'd tongues.\n1-2 lb. pepper.\t6 lbs. rice.\n1 quart best white wine\t6 lbs. raisins.\n1 quart best white wine vinegar.\n\nThese twenty parcels, well pack'd, were placed on as many horses, each parcel, with the horse, being intended as a present for one officer. They were very thankfully receiv'd, and the kindness acknowledg'd by letters to me from the colonels of both regiments, in the most grateful terms. The general, too, was highly satisfied with my conduct in procuring him the waggons, etc., and readily paid my account of disbursements, thanking me repeatedly, and requesting my farther assistance in sending provisions after him. I undertook this also, and was busily employ'd in it till we heard of his defeat, advancing for the service of my own money, upwards of one thousand pounds sterling, of which I sent him an account. It came to his hands, luckily for me, a few days before the battle, and he return'd me immediately an order on the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds, leaving the remainder to the next account. I consider this payment as good luck, having never been able to obtain that remainder, of which more hereafter.\n\nThis general was, I think, a brave man, and might probably have made a figure as a good officer in some European war. But he had too much self-confidence, too high an opinion of the validity of regular troops, and too mean a one of both Americans and Indians. George Croghan, our Indian interpreter, join'd him on his march with one hundred of those people, who might have been of great use to his army as guides, scouts, etc., if he had treated them kindly; but he slighted and neglected them, and they gradually left him.\n\nIn conversation with him one day, he was giving me some account of his intended progress. \"After taking Fort Duquesne,\"[97] says he, \"I am to proceed to Niagara; and, having taken that, to Frontenac,[98] if the season will allow time; and I suppose it will, for Duquesne can hardly detain me above three or four days; and then I see nothing that can obstruct my march to Niagara.\" Having before revolv'd in my mind the long line his army must make in their march by a very narrow road, to be cut for them thro' the woods and bushes, and also what I had read of a former defeat of fifteen hundred French, who invaded the Iroquois country, I had conceiv'd some doubts and some fears for the event of the campaign. But I ventur'd only to say, \"To be sure, sir, if you arrive well before Duquesne, with these fine troops, so well provided with artillery, that place not yet completely fortified, and as we hear with no very strong garrison, can probably make but a short resistance. The only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of Indians, who, by constant practice, are dexterous in laying and executing them; and the slender line, near four miles long, which your army must make, may expose it to be attack'd by surprise in its flanks, and to be cut like a thread into several pieces, which, from their distance, cannot come up in time to support each other.\"\n\nHe smil'd at my ignorance, and reply'd, \"These savages may, indeed, be a formidable enemy to your raw American militia, but upon the king's regular and disciplin'd troops, sir, it is impossible they should make any impression.\" I was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with a military man in matters of his profession, and said no more. The enemy, however, did not take the advantage of his army which I apprehended its long line of march expos'd it to, but let it advance without interruption till within nine miles of the place; and then, when more in a body (for it had just passed a river, where the front had halted till all were come over), and in a more open part of the woods than any it had pass'd, attack'd its advanced guard by heavy fire from behind trees and bushes, which was the first intelligence the general had of an enemy's being near him. This guard being disordered, the general hurried the troops up to their assistance, which was done in great confusion, thro' waggons, baggage, and cattle; and presently the fire came upon their flank: the officers, being on horseback, were more easily distinguish'd, pick'd out as marks, and fell very fast; and the soldiers were crowded together in a huddle, having or hearing no orders, and standing to be shot at till two-thirds of them were killed; and then, being seiz'd with a panick, the whole fled with precipitation.\n\nThe only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of Indians\nThe waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamper'd; their example was immediately followed by others; so that all the waggons, provisions, artillery, and stores were left to the enemy. The general, being wounded, was brought off with difficulty; his secretary, Mr. Shirley, was killed by his side; and out of eighty-six officers, sixty-three were killed or wounded, and seven hundred and fourteen men killed out of eleven hundred. These eleven hundred had been picked men from the whole army; the rest had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar, who was to follow with the heavier part of the stores, provisions, and baggage. The flyers, not being pursu'd, arriv'd at Dunbar's camp, and the panick they brought with them instantly seiz'd him and all his people; and, tho' he had now above one thousand men, and the enemy who had beaten Braddock did not at most exceed four hundred Indians and French together, instead of proceeding, and endeavouring to recover some of the lost honour, he ordered all the stores, ammunition, etc., to be destroy'd, that he might have more horses to assist his flight towards the settlements, and less lumber to remove. He was there met with requests from the governors of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, that he would post his troops on the frontier, so as to afford some protection to the inhabitants; but he continued his hasty march thro' all the country, not thinking himself safe till he arrived at Philadelphia, where the inhabitants could protect him. This whole transaction gave us Americans the first suspicion that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regulars had not been well founded.[99]\n\nIn their first march, too, from their landing till they got beyond the settlements, they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants, totally ruining some poor families, besides insulting, abusing, and confining the people if they remonstrated. This was enough to put us out of conceit of such defenders, if we had really wanted any. How different was the conduct of our French friends in 1781, who, during a march thro' the most inhabited part of our country from Rhode Island to Virginia, near seven hundred miles, occasioned not the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig, a chicken, or even an apple.\n\nCaptain Orme, who was one of the general's aids-de-camp, and, being grievously wounded, was brought off with him, and continu'd with him to his death, which happen'd in a few days, told me that he was totally silent all the first day, and at night only said, \"Who would have thought it?\" That he was silent again the following day, saying only at last, \"We shall better know how to deal with them another time\"; and dy'd in a few minutes after.\n\nThe secretary's papers, with all the general's orders, instructions, and correspondence, falling into the enemy's hands, they selected and translated into French a number of the articles, which they printed, to prove the hostile intentions of the British court before the declaration of war. Among these I saw some letters of the general to the ministry, speaking highly of the great service I had rendered the army, and recommending me to their notice. David Hume,[100] too, who was some years after secretary to Lord Hertford, when minister in France, and afterward to General Conway, when secretary of state, told me he had seen among the papers in that office, letters from Braddock highly recommending me. But, the expedition having been unfortunate, my service, it seems, was not thought of much value, for those recommendations were never of any use to me.\n\nAs to rewards from himself, I ask'd only one, which was, that he would give orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought servants, and that he would discharge such as had been already enlisted. This he readily granted, and several were accordingly return'd to their masters, on my application. Dunbar, when the command devolv'd on him, was not so generous. He being at Philadelphia, on his retreat, or rather flight, I apply'd to him for the discharge of the servants of three poor farmers of Lancaster county that he had enlisted, reminding him of the late general's orders on that head. He promised me that, if the masters would come to him at Trenton, where he should be in a few days on his march to New York, he would there deliver their men to them. They accordingly were at the expense and trouble of going to Trenton, and there he refus'd to perform his promise, to their great loss and disappointment.\n\nAs soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known, all the owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bond to pay. Their demands gave me a great deal of trouble, my acquainting them that the money was ready in the paymaster's hands, but that orders for paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley,[101] and my assuring them that I had apply'd to that general by letter; but, he being at a distance, an answer could not soon be receiv'd, and they must have patience, all this was not sufficient to satisfy, and some began to sue me. General Shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims, and ordering payment. They amounted to near twenty thousand pound, which to pay would have ruined me.\n\nBefore we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors Bond came to me with a subscription paper for raising money to defray the expense of a grand firework, which it was intended to exhibit at a rejoicing on receipt of the news of our taking Fort Duquesne. I looked grave, and said it would, I thought, be time enough to prepare for the rejoicing when we knew we should have occasion to rejoice. They seem'd surpris'd that I did not immediately comply with their proposal. \"Why the d\u2014\u2014l!\" says one of them, \"you surely don't suppose that the fort will not be taken?\" \"I don't know that it will not be taken, but I know that the events of war are subject to great uncertainty.\" I gave them the reasons of my doubting; the subscription was dropt, and the projectors thereby missed the mortification they would have undergone if the firework had been prepared. Dr. Bond, on some other occasion afterward, said that he did not like Franklin's forebodings.\n\nGovernor Morris, who had continually worried the Assembly with message after message before the defeat of Braddock, to beat them into the making of acts to raise money for the defense of the province, without taxing, among others, the proprietary estates, and had rejected all their bills for not having such an exempting clause, now redoubled his attacks with more hope of success, the danger and necessity being greater. The Assembly, however, continu'd firm, believing they had justice on their side, and that it would be giving up an essential right if they suffered the governor to amend their money-bills. In one of the last, indeed, which was for granting fifty thousand pounds, his propos'd amendment was only of a single word. The bill express'd \"that all estates, real and personal, were to be taxed, those of the proprietaries not excepted.\" His amendment was, for not read only: a small, but very material alteration. However, when the news of this disaster reached England, our friends there whom we had taken care to furnish with all the Assembly's answers to the governor's messages, rais'd a clamor against the proprietaries for their meanness and injustice in giving their governor such instructions; some going so far as to say that, by obstructing the defense of their province, they forfeited their right to it. They were intimidated by this, and sent orders to their receiver-general to add five thousand pounds of their money to whatever sum might be given by the Assembly for such purpose.\n\nThis, being notified to the House, was accepted in lieu of their share of a general tax, and a new bill was form'd, with an exempting clause, which passed accordingly. By this act I was appointed one of the commissioners for disposing of the money, sixty thousand pounds. I had been active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage, and had, at the same time, drawn a bill for establishing and disciplining a voluntary militia, which I carried thro' the House without much difficulty, as care was taken in it to leave the Quakers at their liberty. To promote the association necessary to form the militia, I wrote a dialogue,[102] stating and answering all the objections I could think of to such a militia, which was printed, and had, as I thought, great effect.\n\n[96] By chance.\n\n[97] Pittsburg.\n\n[98] Kingston, at the eastern end of Lake Ontario.\n\n[99] Other accounts of this expedition and defeat may be found in Fiske's Washington and his Country, or Lodge's George Washington, Vol. 1.\n\n[100] A famous Scotch philosopher and historian (1711-1776).\n\n[101] Governor of Massachusetts and commander of the British forces in America.\n\n[102] This dialogue and the militia act are in the Gentleman's Magazine for February and March, 1756.\u2014Marg. note.\n\nXVII\n\nFRANKLIN'S DEFENSE OF THE FRONTIER\n\nblock-WHILE the several companies in the city and country were forming, and learning their exercise, the governor prevail'd with me to take charge of our North-western frontier, which was infested by the enemy, and provide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops and building a line of forts. I undertook this military business, tho' I did not conceive myself well qualified for it. He gave me a commission with full powers, and a parcel of blank commissions for officers, to be given to whom I thought fit. I had but little difficulty in raising men, having soon five hundred and sixty under my command. My son, who had in the preceding war been an officer in the army rais'd against Canada, was my aid-de-camp, and of great use to me. The Indians had burned Gnadenhut,[103] a village settled by the Moravians, and massacred the inhabitants; but the place was thought a good situation for one of the forts.\n\nIn order to march thither, I assembled the companies at Bethlehem, the chief establishment of those people. I was surprised to find it in so good a posture of defense; the destruction of Gnadenhut had made them apprehend danger. The principal buildings were defended by a stockade; they had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from New York, and had even plac'd quantities of small paving stones between the windows of their high stone houses, for their women to throw down upon the heads of any Indians that should attempt to force into them. The armed brethren, too, kept watch, and reliev'd as methodically as in any garrison town. In conversation with the bishop, Spangenberg, I mention'd this my surprise; for, knowing they had obtained an act of Parliament exempting them from military duties in the colonies, I had suppos'd they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms. He answer'd me that it was not one of their established principles, but that, at the time of their obtaining that act, it was thought to be a principle with many of their people. On this occasion, however, they, to their surprise, found it adopted by but a few. It seems they were either deceiv'd in themselves, or deceiv'd the Parliament; but common sense, aided by present danger, will sometimes be too strong for whimsical opinions.\n\nIt was the beginning of January when we set out upon this business of building forts. I sent one detachment toward the Minisink, with instructions to erect one for the security of that upper part of the country, and another to the lower part, with similar instructions; and I concluded to go myself with the rest of my force to Gnadenhut, where a fort was tho't more immediately necessary. The Moravians procur'd me five waggons for our tools, stores, baggage, etc.\n\nJust before we left Bethlehem, eleven farmers, who had been driven from their plantations by the Indians, came to me requesting a supply of firearms, that they might go back and fetch off their cattle. I gave them each a gun with suitable ammunition. We had not march'd many miles before it began to rain, and it continued raining all day; there were no habitations on the road to shelter us, till we arriv'd near night at the house of a German, where, and in his barn, we were all huddled together, as wet as water could make us. It was well we were not attack'd in our march, for our arms were of the most ordinary sort, and our men could not keep their gun locks[104] dry. The Indians are dexterous in contrivances for that purpose, which we had not. They met that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned, and killed ten of them. The one who escap'd inform'd that his and his companions' guns would not go off, the priming being wet with the rain.\n\nWe had not march'd many miles before it began to rain\nThe next day being fair, we continu'd our march, and arriv'd at the desolated Gnadenhut. There was a saw-mill near, round which were left several piles of boards, with which we soon hutted ourselves; an operation the more necessary at that inclement season, as we had no tents. Our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found there, who had been half interr'd by the country people.\n\nThe next morning our fort was plann'd and mark'd out, the circumference measuring four hundred and fifty-five feet, which would require as many palisades to be made of trees, one with another, of a foot diameter each. Our axes, of which we had seventy, were immediately set to work to cut down trees, and, our men being dexterous in the use of them, great despatch was made. Seeing the trees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to look at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine; in six minutes they had it upon the ground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter. Each pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long, pointed at one end. While these were preparing, our other men dug a trench all round, of three feet deep, in which the palisades were to be planted; and, our waggons, the bodys being taken off, and the fore and hind wheels separated by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch,[105] we had ten carriages, with two horses each, to bring the palisades from the woods to the spot. When they were set up, our carpenters built a stage of boards all round within, about six feet high, for the men to stand on when to fire thro' the loopholes. We had one swivel gun, which we mounted on one of the angles, and fir'd it as soon as fix'd, to let the Indians know, if any were within hearing, that we had such pieces; and thus our fort, if such a magnificent name may be given to so miserable a stockade, was finish'd in a week, though it rain'd so hard every other day that the men could not work.\n\nOur axes ... were immediately set to work to cut down trees\n\"Our axes ... were immediately set to work to cut down trees\"\nThis gave me occasion to observe, that, when men are employ'd, they are best content'd; for on the days they worked they were good-natur'd and cheerful, and, with the consciousness of having done a good day's work, they spent the evening jollily; but on our idle days they were mutinous and quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork, the bread, etc., and in continual ill-humour, which put me in mind of a sea-captain, whose rule it was to keep his men constantly at work; and, when his mate once told him that they had done everything, and there was nothing further to employ them about, \"Oh,\" says he, \"make them scour the anchor.\"\n\nThis kind of fort, however contemptible, is a sufficient defense against Indians, who have no cannon. Finding ourselves now posted securely, and having a place to retreat to on occasion, we ventur'd out in parties to scour the adjacent country. We met with no Indians, but we found the places on the neighbouring hills where they had lain to watch our proceedings. There was an art in their contrivance of those places that seems worth mention. It being winter, a fire was necessary for them; but a common fire on the surface of the ground would by its light have discover'd their position at a distance. They had therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter, and somewhat deeper; we saw where they had with their hatchets cut off the charcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods. With these coals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes, and we observ'd among the weeds and grass the prints of their bodies, made by their laying all round, with their legs hanging down in the holes to keep their feet warm, which, with them, is an essential point. This kind of fire, so manag'd, could not discover them, either by its light, flame, sparks, or even smoke: it appear'd that their number was not great, and it seems they saw we were too many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage.\n\nWe had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister, Mr. Beatty, who complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers and exhortations. When they enlisted, they were promised, besides pay and provisions, a gill of rum a day, which was punctually serv'd out to them, half in the morning, and the other half in the evening; and I observed they were as punctual in attending to receive it; upon which I said to Mr. Beatty, \"It is, perhaps, below the dignity of your profession to act as steward of the rum, but if you were to deal it out and only just after prayers, you would have them all about you.\" He liked the tho't, undertook the office, and, with the help of a few hands to measure out the liquor, executed it to satisfaction, and never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended; so that I thought this method preferable to the punishment inflicted by some military laws for non-attendance on divine service.\n\nI had hardly finish'd this business, and got my fort well stor'd with provisions, when I receiv'd a letter from the governor, acquainting me that he had call'd the Assembly, and wished my attendance there, if the posture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remaining there was no longer necessary. My friends, too, of the Assembly, pressing me by their letters to be, if possible, at the meeting, and my three intended forts being now compleated, and the inhabitants contented to remain on their farms under that protection, I resolved to return; the more willingly, as a New England officer, Colonel Clapham, experienced in Indian war, being on a visit to our establishment, consented to accept the command. I gave him a commission, and, parading the garrison, had it read before them, and introduc'd him to them as an officer who, from his skill in military affairs, was much more fit to command them than myself; and, giving them a little exhortation, took my leave. I was escorted as far as Bethlehem, where I rested a few days to recover from the fatigue I had undergone. The first night, being in a good bed, I could hardly sleep, it was so different from my hard lodging on the floor of our hut at Gnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two.\n\nWhile at Bethlehem, I inquir'd a little into the practice of the Moravians: some of them had accompanied me, and all were very kind to me. I found they work'd for a common stock, ate at common tables, and slept in common dormitories, great numbers together. In the dormitories I observed loopholes, at certain distances all along just under the ceiling, which I thought judiciously placed for change of air. I was at their church, where I was entertain'd with good musick, the organ being accompanied with violins, hautboys, flutes, clarinets, etc. I understood that their sermons were not usually preached to mixed congregations of men, women, and children, as is our common practice, but that they assembled sometimes the married men, at other times their wives, then the young men, the young women, and the little children, each division by itself. The sermon I heard was to the latter, who came in and were plac'd in rows on benches; the boys under the conduct of a young man, their tutor, and the girls conducted by a young woman. The discourse seem'd well adapted to their capacities, and was delivered in a pleasing, familiar manner, coaxing them, as it were, to be good. They behav'd very orderly, but looked pale and unhealthy, which made me suspect they were kept too much within doors, or not allow'd sufficient exercise.\n\nI inquir'd concerning the Moravian marriages, whether the report was true that they were by lot. I was told that lots were us'd only in particular cases; that generally, when a young man found himself dispos'd to marry, he inform'd the elders of his class, who consulted the elder ladies that govern'd the young women. As these elders of the different sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions of their respective pupils, they could best judge what matches were suitable, and their judgments were generally acquiesc'd in; but if, for example, it should happen that two or three young women were found to be equally proper for the young man, the lot was then recurred to. I objected, if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the parties, some of them may chance to be very unhappy. \"And so they may,\" answer'd my informer, \"if you let the parties chuse for themselves;\" which, indeed, I could not deny.\n\nBeing returned to Philadelphia, I found the association went on swimmingly, the inhabitants that were not Quakers having pretty generally come into it, formed themselves into companies, and chose their captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, according to the new law. Dr. B. visited me, and gave me an account of the pains he had taken to spread a general good liking to the law, and ascribed much to those endeavours. I had had the vanity to ascribe all to my Dialogue; however, not knowing but that he might be in the right, I let him enjoy his opinion, which I take to be generally the best way in such cases. The officers, meeting, chose me to be colonel of the regiment, which I this time accepted. I forget how many companies we had, but we paraded about twelve hundred well-looking men, with a company of artillery, who had been furnished with six brass field-pieces, which they had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve times in a minute. The first time I reviewed my regiment they accompanied me to my house, and would salute me with some rounds fired before my door, which shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus. And my new honour proved not much less brittle; for all our commissions were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in England.\n\nDuring this short time of my colonelship, being about to set out on a journey to Virginia, the officers of my regiment took it into their heads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town, as far as the Lower Ferry. Just as I was getting on horseback they came to my door, between thirty and forty, mounted, and all in their uniforms. I had not been previously acquainted with the project, or I should have prevented it, being naturally averse to the assuming of state on any occasion; and I was a good deal chagrin'd at their appearance, as I could not avoid their accompanying me. What made it worse was, that, as soon as we began to move, they drew their swords and rode with them naked all the way. Somebody wrote an account of this to the proprietor, and it gave him great offense. No such honour had been paid him when in the province, nor to any of his governors; and he said it was only proper to princes of the blood royal, which may be true for aught I know, who was, and still am, ignorant of the etiquette in such cases.\n\nThis silly affair, however, greatly increased his rancour against me, which was before not a little, on account of my conduct in the Assembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation, which I had always oppos'd very warmly, and not without severe reflections on his meanness and injustice of contending for it. He accused me to the ministry as being the great obstacle to the King's service, preventing, by my influence in the House, the proper form of the bills for raising money, and he instanced this parade with my officers as a proof of my having an intention to take the government of the province out of his hands by force. He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener, the postmaster-general, to deprive me of my office; but it had no other effect than to procure from Sir Everard a gentle admonition.\n\nNotwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and the House, in which I, as a member, had so large a share, there still subsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman and myself, and we never had any personal difference. I have sometimes since thought that his little or no resentment against me, for the answers it was known I drew up to his messages, might be the effect of professional habit, and that, being bred a lawyer, he might consider us both as merely advocates for contending clients in a suit, he for the proprietaries and I for the Assembly. He would, therefore, sometimes call in a friendly way to advise with me on difficult points, and sometimes, tho' not often, take my advice.\n\nWe acted in concert to supply Braddock's army with provisions; and, when the shocking news arrived of his defeat, the governor sent in haste for me, to consult with him on measures for preventing the desertion of the back counties. I forget now the advice I gave; but I think it was, that Dunbar should be written to, and prevail'd with, if possible, to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection, till, by reinforcements from the colonies, he might be able to proceed on the expedition. And, after my return from the frontier, he would have had me undertake the conduct of such an expedition with provincial troops, for the reduction of Fort Duquesne, Dunbar and his men being otherwise employed; and he proposed to commission me as general. I had not so good an opinion of my military abilities as he profess'd to have, and I believe his professions must have exceeded his real sentiments; but probably he might think that my popularity would facilitate the raising of the men, and my influence in Assembly, the grant of money to pay them, and that, perhaps, without taxing the proprietary estate. Finding me not so forward to engage as he expected, the project was dropt, and he soon after left the government, being superseded by Captain Denny.\n\n[103] Pronounced Gna\u00b4-den-hoot.\n\n[104] Flint-lock guns, discharged by means of a spark struck from flint and steel into powder (priming) in an open pan.\n\n[105] Here the pole connecting the front and rear wheels of a wagon.\n\nXVIII\n\nSCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS\n\nblock-bEFORE I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs under this new governor's administration, it may not be amiss here to give some account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation.\n\nIn 1746, being at Boston, I met there with a Dr. Spence, who was lately arrived from Scotland, and show'd me some electric experiments. They were imperfectly perform'd, as he was not very expert; but, being on a subject quite new to me, they equally surpris'd and pleased me. Soon after my return to Philadelphia, our library company receiv'd from Mr. P. Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society[106] of London, a present of a glass tube, with some account of the use of it in making such experiments. I eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what I had seen at Boston; and, by much practice, acquired great readiness in performing those, also, which we had an account of from England, adding a number of new ones. I say much practice, for my house was continually full, for some time, with people who came to see these new wonders.\n\nTo divide a little this incumbrance among my friends, I caused a number of similar tubes to be blown at our glass-house, with which they furnish'd themselves, so that we had at length several performers. Among these, the principal was Mr. Kinnersley, an ingenious neighbour, who, being out of business, I encouraged to undertake showing the experiments for money, and drew up for him two lectures, in which the experiments were rang'd in such order, and accompanied with such explanations in such method, as that the foregoing should assist in comprehending the following. He procur'd an elegant apparatus for the purpose, in which all the little machines that I had roughly made for myself were nicely form'd by instrument-makers. His lectures were well attended, and gave great satisfaction; and after some time he went thro' the colonies, exhibiting them in every capital town, and pick'd up some money. In the West India islands, indeed, it was with difficulty the experiments could be made, from the general moisture of the air.\n\nOblig'd as we were to Mr. Collinson for his present of the tube, etc., I thought it right he should be inform'd of our success in using it, and wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments. He got them read in the Royal Society, where they were not at first thought worth so much notice as to be printed in their Transactions. One paper, which I wrote for Mr. Kinnersley, on the sameness of lightning with electricity,[107] I sent to Dr. Mitchel, an acquaintance of mine, and one of the members also of that society, who wrote me word that it had been read, but was laughed at by the connoisseurs. The papers, however, being shown to Dr. Fothergill, he thought them of too much value to be stifled, and advis'd the printing of them. Mr. Collinson then gave them to Cave for publication in his Gentleman's Magazine; but he chose to print them separately in a pamphlet, and Dr. Fothergill wrote the preface. Cave, it seems, judged rightly for his profit, for by the additions that arrived afterward, they swell'd to a quarto volume, which has had five editions, and cost him nothing for copy-money.\n\nIt was, however, some time before those papers were much taken notice of in England. A copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the Count de Buffon,[108] a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in France, and, indeed, all over Europe, he prevailed with M. Dalibard[109] to translate them into French, and they were printed at Paris. The publication offended the Abb\u00e9 Nollet, preceptor in Natural Philosophy to the royal family, and an able experimenter, who had form'd and publish'd a theory of electricity, which then had the general vogue. He could not at first believe that such a work came from America, and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry his system. Afterwards, having been assur'd that there really existed such a person as Franklin at Philadelphia, which he had doubted, he wrote and published a volume of Letters, chiefly address'd to me, defending his theory, and denying the verity of my experiments, and of the positions deduc'd from them.\n\nI once purpos'd answering the abb\u00e9, and actually began the answer; but, on consideration that my writings contained a description of experiments which anyone might repeat and verify, and if not to be verifi'd, could not be defended; or of observations offer'd as conjectures, and not delivered dogmatically, therefore not laying me under any obligation to defend them; and reflecting that a dispute between two persons, writing in different languages, might be lengthened greatly by mistranslations, and thence misconceptions of one another's meaning, much of one of the abb\u00e9's letters being founded on an error in the translation, I concluded to let my papers shift for themselves, believing it was better to spend what time I could spare from public business in making new experiments, than in disputing about those already made. I therefore never answered M. Nollet, and the event gave me no cause to repent my silence; for my friend M. le Roy, of the Royal Academy of Sciences, took up my cause and refuted him; my book was translated into the Italian, German, and Latin languages; and the doctrine it contain'd was by degrees universally adopted by the philosophers of Europe, in preference to that of the abb\u00e9; so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect, except Monsieur B\u2014\u2014, of Paris, his \u00e9l\u00e8ve and immediate disciple.\n\nWhat gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity, was the success of one of its proposed experiments, made by Messrs. Dalibard and De Lor at Marly, for drawing lightning from the clouds. This engag'd the public attention everywhere. M. de Lor, who had an apparatus for experimental philosophy, and lectur'd in that branch of science, undertook to repeat what he called the Philadelphia Experiments; and, after they were performed before the king and court, all the curious of Paris flocked to see them. I will not swell this narrative with an account of that capital experiment, nor of the infinite pleasure I receiv'd in the success of a similar one I made soon after with a kite at Philadelphia, as both are to be found in the histories of electricity.\n\nDr. Wright, an English physician, when at Paris, wrote to a friend, who was of the Royal Society, an account of the high esteem my experiments were in among the learned abroad, and of their wonder that my writings had been so little noticed in England. The society, on this, resum'd the consideration of the letters that had been read to them; and the celebrated Dr. Watson drew up a summary account of them, and of all I had afterwards sent to England on the subject, which he accompanied with some praise of the writer. This summary was then printed in their Transactions; and some members of the society in London, particularly the very ingenious Mr. Canton, having verified the experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed rod, and acquainting them with the success, they soon made me more than amends for the slight with which they had before treated me. Without my having made any application for that honour, they chose me a member, and voted that I should be excus'd the customary payments, which would have amounted to twenty-five guineas; and ever since have given me their Transactions gratis. They also presented me with the gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley[110] for the year 1753, the delivery of which was accompanied by a very handsome speech of the president, Lord Macclesfield, wherein I was highly honoured.\n\n[106] The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge was founded in 1660 and holds the foremost place among English societies for the advancement of science.\n\n[107]See page 327.\n\n[108] A celebrated French naturalist (1707-1788).\n\n[109] Dalibard, who had translated Franklin's letters to Collinson into French, was the first to demonstrate, in a practical application of Franklin's experiment, that lightning and electricity are the same. \"This was May 10th, 1752, one month before Franklin flew his famous kite at Philadelphia and proved the fact himself.\"\u2014McMaster.\n\n[110] An English baronet (died in 1709), donator of a fund of \u00a3100, \"in trust for the Royal Society of London for improving natural knowledge.\"\n\nthe gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley\nXIX\n\nAGENT OF PENNSYLVANIA IN LONDON\n\nblock-OUR new governor, Captain Denny, brought over for me the before mentioned medal from the Royal Society, which he presented to me at an entertainment given him by the city. He accompanied it with very polite expressions of his esteem for me, having, as he said, been long acquainted with my character. After dinner, when the company, as was customary at that time, were engag'd in drinking, he took me aside into another room, and acquainted me that he had been advis'd by his friends in England to cultivate a friendship with me, as one who was capable of giving him the best advice, and of contributing most effectually to the making his administration easy; that he therefore desired of all things to have a good understanding with me, and he begged me to be assured of his readiness on all occasions to render me every service that might be in his power. He said much to me, also, of the proprietor's good disposition towards the province, and of the advantage it might be to us all, and to me in particular, if the opposition that had been so long continu'd to his measures was dropt, and harmony restor'd between him and the people; in effecting which, it was thought no one could be more serviceable than myself; and I might depend on adequate acknowledgments and recompenses, etc., etc. The drinkers, finding we did not return immediately to the table, sent us a decanter of Madeira, which the governor made liberal use of, and in proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and promises.\n\nMy answers were to this purpose: that my circumstances, thanks to God, were such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me; and that, being a member of the Assembly, I could not possibly accept of any; that, however, I had no personal enmity to the proprietary, and that, whenever the public measures he propos'd should appear to be for the good of the people, no one should espouse and forward them more zealously than myself; my past opposition having been founded on this, that the measures which had been urged were evidently intended to serve the proprietary interest, with great prejudice to that of the people; that I was much obliged to him (the governor) for his professions of regard to me, and that he might rely on everything in my power to make his administration as easy as possible, hoping at the same time that he had not brought with him the same unfortunate instruction his predecessor had been hampered with.\n\nOn this he did not then explain himself; but when he afterwards came to do business with the Assembly, they appear'd again, the disputes were renewed, and I was as active as ever in the opposition, being the penman, first, of the request to have a communication of the instructions, and then of the remarks upon them, which may be found in the votes of the time, and in the Historical Review I afterward publish'd. But between us personally no enmity arose; we were often together; he was a man of letters, had seen much of the world, and was very entertaining and pleasing in conversation. He gave me the first information that my old friend Jas. Ralph was still alive; that he was esteem'd one of the best political writers in England; had been employed in the dispute[111] between Prince Frederic and the king, and had obtain'd a pension of three hundred a year; that his reputation was indeed small as a poet, Pope having damned his poetry in the Dunciad,[112] but his prose was thought as good as any man's.\n\nThe Assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted in manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only with the privileges of the people, but with the service of the crown, resolv'd to petition the king against them, and appointed me their agent to go over to England, to present and support the petition. The House had sent up a bill to the governor, granting a sum of sixty thousand pounds for the king's use (ten thousand pounds of which was subjected to the orders of the then general, Lord Loudoun), which the governor absolutely refus'd to pass, in compliance with his instructions.\n\nI had agreed with Captain Morris, of the packet at New York, for my passage, and my stores were put on board, when Lord Loudoun arriv'd at Philadelphia, expressly, as he told me, to endeavour an accommodation between the governor and Assembly, that his majesty's service might not be obstructed by their dissensions. Accordingly, he desir'd the governor and myself to meet him, that he might hear what was to be said on both sides. We met and discussed the business. In behalf of the Assembly, I urged all the various arguments that may be found in the public papers of that time, which were of my writing, and are printed with the minutes of the Assembly; and the governor pleaded his instructions, the bond he had given to observe them, and his ruin if he disobey'd, yet seemed not unwilling to hazard himself if Lord Loudoun would advise it. This his lordship did not chuse to do, though I once thought I had nearly prevail'd with him to do it; but finally he rather chose to urge the compliance of the Assembly; and he entreated me to use my endeavours with them for that purpose, declaring that he would spare none of the king's troops for the defense of our frontiers, and that, if we did not continue to provide for that defense ourselves, they must remain expos'd to the enemy.\n\nI acquainted the House with what had pass'd, and, presenting them with a set of resolutions I had drawn up, declaring our rights, and that we did not relinquish our claim to those rights, but only suspended the exercise of them on this occasion thro' force, against which we protested, they at length agreed to drop that bill, and frame another conformable to the proprietary instructions. This of course the governor pass'd, and I was then at liberty to proceed on my voyage. But, in the meantime, the packet had sailed with my sea-stores, which was some loss to me, and my only recompense was his lordship's thanks for my service, all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling to his share.\n\nHe set out for New York before me; and, as the time for dispatching the packet-boats was at his disposition, and there were two then remaining there, one of which, he said, was to sail very soon, I requested to know the precise time, that I might not miss her by any delay of mine. His answer was, \"I have given out that she is to sail on Saturday next; but I may let you know, entre nous, that if you are there by Monday morning, you will be in time, but do not delay longer.\" By some accidental hindrance at a ferry, it was Monday noon before I arrived, and I was much afraid she might have sailed, as the wind was fair; but I was soon made easy by the information that she was still in the harbor, and would not move till the next day. One would imagine that I was now on the very point of departing for Europe. I thought so; but I was not then so well acquainted with his lordship's character, of which indecision was one of the strongest features. I shall give some instances. It was about the beginning of April that I came to New York, and I think it was near the end of June before we sail'd. There were then two of the packet-boats, which had been long in port, but were detained for the general's letters, which were always to be ready to-morrow. Another packet arriv'd; she too was detain'd; and, before we sail'd, a fourth was expected. Ours was the first to be dispatch'd, as having been there longest. Passengers were engaged in all, and some extremely impatient to be gone, and the merchants uneasy about their letters, and the orders they had given for insurance (it being war time) for fall goods; but their anxiety avail'd nothing; his lordship's letters were not ready; and yet whoever waited on him found him always at his desk, pen in hand, and concluded he must needs write abundantly.\n\nGoing myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in his antechamber one Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia, who had come from thence express with a packet from Governor Denny for the general. He delivered to me some letters from my friends there, which occasion'd my inquiring when he was to return, and where he lodg'd, that I might send some letters by him. He told me he was order'd to call to-morrow at nine for the general's answer to the governor, and should set off immediately. I put my letters into his hands the same day. A fortnight after I met him again in the same place. \"So, you are soon return'd, Innis?\" \"Return'd! no, I am not gone yet.\" \"How so?\" \"I have called here by order every morning these two weeks past for his lordship's letter, and it is not yet ready.\" \"Is it possible, when he is so great a writer? for I see him constantly at his escritoire.\" \"Yes,\" says Innis, \"but he is like St. George on the signs, always on horseback, and never rides on.\" This observation of the messenger was, it seems, well founded; for, when in England, I understood that Mr. Pitt[113] gave it as one reason for removing this general, and sending Generals Amherst and Wolfe, that the minister never heard from him, and could not know what he was doing.\n\nThis daily expectation of sailing, and all the three packets going down to Sandy Hook, to join the fleet there, the passengers thought it best to be on board, lest by a sudden order the ships should sail, and they be left behind. There, if I remember right, we were about six weeks, consuming our sea-stores, and oblig'd to procure more. At length the fleet sail'd, the general and all his army on board, bound to Louisburg, with the intent to besiege and take that fortress; all the packet-boats in company ordered to attend the general's ship, ready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready. We were out five days before we got a letter with leave to part, and then our ship quitted the fleet and steered for England. The other two packets he still detained, carried them with him to Halifax, where he stayed some time to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts, then altered his mind as to besieging Louisburg, and returned to New York, with all his troops, together with the two packets above mentioned, and all their passengers! During his absence the French and savages had taken Fort George, on the frontier of that province, and the savages had massacred many of the garrison after capitulation.\n\nI saw afterwards in London Captain Bonnell, who commanded one of those packets. He told me that, when he had been detain'd a month, he acquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul, to a degree that must necessarily hinder her fast sailing, a point of consequence for a packet-boat, and requested an allowance of time to heave her down and clean her bottom. He was asked how long time that would require. He answered, three days. The general replied, \"If you can do it in one day, I give leave; otherwise not; for you must certainly sail the day after to-morrow.\" So he never obtain'd leave, though detained afterwards from day to day during full three months.\n\nI saw also in London one of Bonnell's passengers, who was so enrag'd against his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so long at New York, and then carrying him to Halifax and back again, that he swore he would sue him for damages. Whether he did or not, I never heard; but, as he represented the injury to his affairs, it was very considerable.\n\nOn the whole, I wonder'd much how such a man came to be intrusted[114] with so important a business as the conduct of a great army; but, having since seen more of the great world, and the means of obtaining, and motives for giving places, my wonder is diminished. General Shirley, on whom the command of the army devolved upon the death of Braddock, would, in my opinion, if continued in place, have made a much better campaign than that of Loudoun in 1757, which was frivolous, expensive, and disgraceful to our nation beyond conception; for, tho' Shirley was not a bred soldier, he was sensible and sagacious in himself, and attentive to good advice from others, capable of forming judicious plans, and quick and active in carrying them into execution. Loudoun, instead of defending the colonies with his great army, left them totally expos'd while he paraded idly at Halifax, by which means Fort George was lost, besides, he derang'd all our mercantile operations, and distress'd our trade, by a long embargo on the exportation of provisions, on pretence of keeping supplies from being obtain'd by the enemy, but in reality for beating down their price in favour of the contractors, in whose profits, it was said, perhaps from suspicion only, he had a share. And, when at length the embargo was taken off, by neglecting to send notice of it to Charlestown, the Carolina fleet was detain'd near three months longer, whereby their bottoms were so much damaged by the worm that a great part of them foundered in their passage home.\n\nShirley was, I believe, sincerely glad of being relieved from so burdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a man unacquainted with military business. I was at the entertainment given by the city of New York to Lord Loudoun, on his taking upon him the command. Shirley, tho' thereby superseded, was present also. There was a great company of officers, citizens, and strangers, and, some chairs having been borrowed in the neighborhood, there was one among them very low, which fell to the lot of Mr. Shirley. Perceiving it as I sat by him, I said, \"They have given you, sir, too low a seat.\" \"No matter,\" says he, \"Mr. Franklin, I find a low seat the easiest.\"\n\nWhile I was, as afore mention'd, detain'd at New York, I receiv'd all the accounts of the provisions, etc., that I had furnish'd to Braddock, some of which accounts could not sooner be obtain'd from the different persons I had employ'd to assist in the business. I presented them to Lord Loudoun, desiring to be paid the balance. He caus'd them to be regularly examined by the proper officer, who, after comparing every article with its voucher, certified them to be right; and the balance due for which his lordship promis'd to give me an order on the paymaster. This was, however, put off from time to time; and tho' I call'd often for it by appointment, I did not get it. At length, just before my departure, he told me he had, on better consideration, concluded not to mix his accounts with those of his predecessors. \"And you,\" says he, \"when in England, have only to exhibit your accounts at the treasury, and you will be paid immediately.\"\n\nI mention'd, but without effect, the great and unexpected expense I had been put to by being detain'd so long at New York, as a reason for my desiring to be presently paid; and on my observing that it was not right I should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining the money I had advanc'd, as I charged no commission for my service, \"O, Sir,\" says he, \"you must not think of persuading us that you are no gainer; we understand better those affairs, and know that every one concerned in supplying the army finds means, in the doing it, to fill his own pockets.\" I assur'd him that was not my case, and that I had not pocketed a farthing; but he appear'd clearly not to believe me; and, indeed, I have since learnt that immense fortunes are often made in such employments. As to my balance, I am not paid it to this day, of which more hereafter.\n\nOur captain of the packet had boasted much, before we sailed, of the swiftness of his ship; unfortunately, when we came to sea, she proved the dullest of ninety-six sail, to his no small mortification. After many conjectures respecting the cause, when we were near another ship almost as dull as ours, which, however, gain'd upon us, the captain ordered all hands to come aft, and stand as near the ensign staff as possible. We were, passengers included, about forty persons. While we stood there, the ship mended her pace, and soon left her neighbour far behind, which prov'd clearly what our captain suspected, that she was loaded too much by the head. The casks of water, it seems, had been all plac'd forward; these he therefore order'd to be mov'd further aft, on which the ship recover'd her character, and proved the best sailer in the fleet.\n\nThe captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots, which is accounted thirteen miles per hour. We had on board, as a passenger, Captain Kennedy, of the Navy, who contended that it was impossible, and that no ship ever sailed so fast, and that there must have been some error in the division of the log-line, or some mistake in heaving the log.[115] A wager ensu'd between the two captains, to be decided when there should be sufficient wind. Kennedy thereupon examin'd rigorously the log-line, and, being satisfi'd with that, he determin'd to throw the log himself. Accordingly some days after, when the wind blew very fair and fresh, and the captain of the packet, Lutwidge, said he believ'd she then went at the rate of thirteen knots, Kennedy made the experiment, and own'd his wager lost.\n\nThe above fact I give for the sake of the following observation. It has been remark'd, as an imperfection in the art of ship-building, that it can never be known, till she is tried, whether a new ship will or will not be a good sailer; for that the model of a good-sailing ship has been exactly follow'd in a new one, which has prov'd, on the contrary, remarkably dull. I apprehend that this may partly be occasion'd by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modes of lading, rigging, and sailing of a ship; each has his system; and the same vessel, laden by the judgment and orders of one captain, shall sail better or worse than when by the orders of another. Besides, it scarce ever happens that a ship is form'd, fitted for the sea, and sail'd by the same person. One man builds the hull, another rigs her, a third lades and sails her. No one of these has the advantage of knowing all the ideas and experience of the others, and, therefore, cannot draw just conclusions from a combination of the whole.\n\nEven in the simple operation of sailing when at sea, I have often observ'd different judgments in the officers who commanded the successive watches, the wind being the same. One would have the sails trimm'd sharper or flatter than another, so that they seem'd to have no certain rule to govern by. Yet I think a set of experiments might be instituted; first, to determine the most proper form of the hull for swift sailing; next, the best dimensions and properest place for the masts; then the form and quantity of sails, and their position, as the wind may be; and, lastly, the disposition of the lading. This is an age of experiments, and I think a set accurately made and combin'd would be of great use. I am persuaded, therefore, that ere long some ingenious philosopher will undertake it, to whom I wish success.\n\nSailboat\nWe were several times chas'd in our passage, but out-sail'd every thing, and in thirty days had soundings. We had a good observation, and the captain judg'd himself so near our port, Falmouth, that, if we made a good run in the night, we might be off the mouth of that harbor in the morning, and by running in the night might escape the notice of the enemy's privateers, who often cruis'd near the entrance of the channel. Accordingly, all the sail was set that we could possibly make, and the wind being very fresh and fair, we went right before it, and made great way. The captain, after his observation, shap'd his course, as he thought, so as to pass wide of the Scilly Isles; but it seems there is sometimes a strong indraught setting up St. George's Channel, which deceives seamen and caused the loss of Sir Cloudesley Shovel's squadron. This indraught was probably the cause of what happened to us.\n\nWe had a watchman plac'd in the bow, to whom they often called, \"Look well out before there,\" and he as often answered, \"Ay, ay\"; but perhaps had his eyes shut, and was half asleep at the time, they sometimes answering, as is said, mechanically; for he did not see a light just before us, which had been hid by the studding-sails from the man at the helm, and from the rest of the watch, but by an accidental yaw of the ship was discover'd, and occasion'd a great alarm, we being very near it, the light appearing to me as big as a cartwheel. It was midnight, and our captain fast asleep; but Captain Kennedy, jumping upon deck, and seeing the danger, ordered the ship to wear round, all sails standing; an operation dangerous to the masts, but it carried us clear, and we escaped shipwreck, for we were running right upon the rocks on which the lighthouse was erected. This deliverance impressed me strongly with the utility of lighthouses, and made me resolve to encourage the building more of them in America if I should live to return there.\n\nIn the morning it was found by the soundings, etc., that we were near our port, but a thick fog hid the land from our sight. About nine o'clock the fog began to rise, and seem'd to be lifted up from the water like the curtain at a play-house, discovering underneath, the town of Falmouth, the vessels in its harbor, and the fields that surrounded it. This was a most pleasing spectacle to those who had been so long without any other prospects than the uniform view of a vacant ocean, and it gave us the more pleasure as we were now free from the anxieties which the state of war occasion'd.\n\nI set out immediately, with my son, for London, and we only stopt a little by the way to view Stonehenge[116] on Salisbury Plain, and Lord Pembroke's house and gardens, with his very curious antiquities at Wilton. We arrived in London the 27th of July, 1757.[117]\n\nAs soon as I was settled in a lodging Mr. Charles had provided for me, I went to visit Dr. Fothergill, to whom I was strongly recommended, and whose counsel respecting my proceedings I was advis'd to obtain. He was against an immediate complaint to government, and thought the proprietaries should first be personally appli'd to, who might possibly be induc'd by the interposition and persuasion of some private friends, to accommodate matters amicably. I then waited on my old friend and correspondent, Mr. Peter Collinson, who told me that John Hanbury, the great Virginia merchant, had requested to be informed when I should arrive, that he might carry me to Lord Granville's,[118] who was then President of the Council and wished to see me as soon as possible. I agreed to go with him the next morning. Accordingly Mr. Hanbury called for me and took me in his carriage to that nobleman's, who receiv'd me with great civility; and after some questions respecting the present state of affairs in America and discourse thereupon, he said to me: \"You Americans have wrong ideas of the nature of your constitution; you contend that the king's instructions to his governors are not laws, and think yourselves at liberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion. But those instructions are not like the pocket instructions given to a minister going abroad, for regulating his conduct in some trifling point of ceremony. They are first drawn up by judges learned in the laws; they are then considered, debated, and perhaps amended in Council, after which they are signed by the king. They are then, so far as they relate to you, the law of the land, for the king is the Legislator of the Colonies,\"[119] I told his lordship this was new doctrine to me. I had always understood from our charters that our laws were to be made by our Assemblies, to be presented indeed to the king for his royal assent, but that being once given the king could not repeal or alter them. And as the Assemblies could not make permanent laws without his assent, so neither could he make a law for them without theirs. He assur'd me I was totally mistaken. I did not think so, however, and his lordship's conversation having a little alarm'd me as to what might be the sentiments of the court concerning us, I wrote it down as soon as I return'd to my lodgings. I recollected that about 20 years before, a clause in a bill brought into Parliament by the ministry had propos'd to make the king's instructions laws in the colonies, but the clause was thrown out by the Commons, for which we adored them as our friends and friends of liberty, till by their conduct towards us in 1765 it seem'd that they had refus'd that point of sovereignty to the king only that they might reserve it for themselves.\n\nWith his keen insight into human nature and his consequent knowledge of American character, he foresaw the inevitable result of such an attitude on the part of England. This conversation with Grenville makes these last pages of the Autobiography one of its most important parts.\n\nAfter some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries, they agreed to a meeting with me at Mr. T. Penn's house in Spring Garden. The conversation at first consisted of mutual declarations of disposition to reasonable accommodations, but I suppose each party had its own ideas of what should be meant by reasonable. We then went into consideration of our several points of complaint, which I enumerated. The proprietaries justify'd their conduct as well as they could, and I the Assembly's. We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement. However, it was concluded that I should give them the heads of our complaints in writing, and they promis'd then to consider them. I did so soon after, but they put the paper into the hands of their solicitor, Ferdinand John Paris, who managed for them all their law business in their great suit with the neighbouring proprietary of Maryland, Lord Baltimore, which had subsisted 70 years, and wrote for them all their papers and messages in their dispute with the Assembly. He was a proud, angry man, and as I had occasionally in the answers of the Assembly treated his papers with some severity, they being really weak in point of argument and haughty in expression, he had conceived a mortal enmity to me, which discovering itself whenever we met, I declin'd the proprietary's proposal that he and I should discuss the heads of complaint between our two selves, and refus'd treating with anyone but them. They then by his advice put the paper into the hands of the Attorney and Solicitor-General for their opinion and counsel upon it, where it lay unanswered a year wanting eight days, during which time I made frequent demands of an answer from the proprietaries, but without obtaining any other than that they had not yet received the opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor-General. What it was when they did receive it I never learnt, for they did not communicate it to me, but sent a long message to the Assembly drawn and signed by Paris, reciting my paper, complaining of its want of formality, as a rudeness on my part, and giving a flimsy justification of their conduct, adding that they should be willing to accommodate matters if the Assembly would send out some person of candour to treat with them for that purpose, intimating thereby that I was not such.\n\nWe now appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement\n\"We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement\"\nThe want of formality or rudeness was, probably, my not having address'd the paper to them with their assum'd titles of True and Absolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania, which I omitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper, the intention of which was only to reduce to a certainty by writing, what in conversation I had delivered viva voce.\n\nBut during this delay, the Assembly having prevailed with Gov'r Denny to pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common with the estates of the people, which was the grand point in dispute, they omitted answering the message.\n\nWhen this act however came over, the proprietaries, counselled by Paris, determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent. Accordingly they petitioned the king in Council, and a hearing was appointed in which two lawyers were employ'd by them against the act, and two by me in support of it. They alledg'd that the act was intended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare those of the people, and that if it were suffer'd to continue in force, and the proprietaries, who were in odium with the people, left to their mercy in proportioning the taxes, they would inevitably be ruined. We reply'd that the act had no such intention, and would have no such effect. That the assessors were honest and discreet men under an oath to assess fairly and equitably, and that any advantage each of them might expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting that of the proprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves. This is the purport of what I remember as urged by both sides, except that we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequences that must attend a repeal, for that the money, \u00a3100,000, being printed and given to the king's use, expended in his service, and now spread among the people, the repeal would strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of many, and the total discouragement of future grants, and the selfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such a general catastrophe, merely from a groundless fear of their estate being taxed too highly, was insisted on in the strongest terms. On this, Lord Mansfield, one of the counsel, rose, and beckoning me took me into the clerk's chamber, while the lawyers were pleading, and asked me if I was really of opinion that no injury would be done the proprietary estate in the execution of the act. I said certainly. \"Then,\" says he, \"you can have little objection to enter into an engagement to assure that point.\" I answer'd, \"None at all.\" He then call'd in Paris, and after some discourse, his lordship's proposition was accepted on both sides; a paper to the purpose was drawn up by the Clerk of the Council, which I sign'd with Mr. Charles, who was also an Agent of the Province for their ordinary affairs, when Lord Mansfield returned to the Council Chamber, where finally the law was allowed to pass. Some changes were however recommended and we also engaged they should be made by a subsequent law, but the Assembly did not think them necessary; for one year's tax having been levied by the act before the order of Council arrived, they appointed a committee to examine the proceedings of the assessors, and on this committee they put several particular friends of the proprietaries. After a full enquiry, they unanimously sign'd a report that they found the tax had been assess'd with perfect equity.\n\nThe Assembly looked into my entering into the first part of the engagement, as an essential service to the Province, since it secured the credit of the paper money then spread over all the country. They gave me their thanks in form when I return'd. But the proprietaries were enraged at Governor Denny for having pass'd the act, and turn'd him out with threats of suing him for breach of instructions which he had given bond to observe. He, however, having done it at the instance of the General, and for His Majesty's service, and having some powerful interest at court, despis'd the threats and they were never put in execution....

MDCCVI.\nAPPENDIX\n\nELECTRICAL KITE\n\nTo Peter Collinson\n[Philadelphia], Oct. 19, 1752.\n\nSir,\n\nAs frequent mention is made in public papers from Europe of the success of the Philadelphia experiment for drawing the electric fire from clouds by means of pointed rods of iron erected on high buildings, &c., it may be agreeable to the curious to be informed, that the same experiment has succeeded in Philadelphia, though made in a different and more easy manner, which is as follows:\n\nMake a small cross of two light strips of cedar, the arms so long as to reach to the four corners of a large, thin silk handkerchief when extended; tie the corners of the handkerchief to the extremities of the cross, so you have the body of a kite; which being properly accommodated with a tail, loop, and string, will rise in the air, like those made of paper; but this being of silk, is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a thunder-gust without tearing. To the top of the upright stick of the cross is to be fixed a very sharp-pointed wire, rising a foot or more above the wood. To the end of the twine, next the hand, is to be tied a silk ribbon, and where the silk and twine join, a key may be fastened. This kite is to be raised when a thunder-gust appears to be coming on, and the person who holds the string must stand within a door or window, or under some cover, so that the silk ribbon may not be wet; and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame of the door or window. As soon as any of the thunder clouds come over the kite, the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them, and the kite, with all the twine will be electrified, and the loose filaments of the twine will stand out every way and be attracted by an approaching finger. And when the rain has wet the kite and twine, so that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it stream out plentifully from the key on the approach of your knuckle. At this key the phial may be charged; and from electric fire thus obtained, spirits may be kindled, and all the electric experiments be performed, which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube, and thereby the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning completely demonstrated.\n\nB.

Reproduced from a copy at the New York Public Library.\n\nTHE WAY TO WEALTH\n\n(From \"Father Abraham's Speech,\" forming the preface to Poor Richard's Almanac for 1758.)\n\nIt would be thought a hard Government that should tax its People one-tenth Part of their Time, to be employed in its Service. But Idleness taxes many of us much more, if we reckon all that is spent in absolute Sloth, or doing of nothing, with that which is spent in idle Employments or Amusements, that amount to nothing. Sloth, by bringing on Diseases, absolutely shortens Life. Sloth, like Rust, consumes faster than Labor wears; while the used key is always bright, as Poor Richard says. But dost thou love Life, then do not squander Time, for that's the stuff Life is made of, as Poor Richard says. How much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep, forgetting that The sleeping Fox catches no Poultry, and that There will be sleeping enough in the Grave, as Poor Richard says.\n\nIf Time be of all Things the most precious, wasting Time must be, as Poor Richard says, the greatest Prodigality; since, as he elsewhere tells us, Lost Time is never found again; and what we call Time enough, always proves little enough: Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the Purpose; so by Diligence shall we do more with less Perplexity. Sloth makes all Things difficult, but Industry all easy, as Poor Richard says; and He that riseth late must trot all Day, and shall scarce overtake his Business at Night; while Laziness travels so slowly, that Poverty soon overtakes him, as we read in Poor Richard, who adds, Drive thy Business, let not that drive thee; and Early to Bed, and early to rise, makes a Man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\n\nIndustry need not wish, and he that lives upon Hope will die fasting.\n\nThere are no Gains without Pains.\n\nHe that hath a Trade hath an Estate; and he that hath a Calling, hath an Office of Profit and Honor; but then the Trade must be worked at, and the Calling well followed, or neither the Estate nor the Office will enable us to pay our Taxes.\n\nWhat though you have found no Treasure, nor has any rich Relation left you a Legacy, Diligence is the Mother of Good-luck, as Poor Richard says, and God gives all Things to Industry.\n\nOne To-day is worth two To-morrows, and farther, Have you somewhat to do To-morrow, do it To-day.\n\nIf you were a Servant, would you not be ashamed that a good Master should catch you idle? Are you then your own Master, be ashamed to catch yourself idle.\n\nStick to it steadily; and you will see great Effects, for Constant Dropping wears away Stones, and by Diligence and Patience the Mouse ate in two the Cable; and Little Strokes fell great Oaks.\n\nMethinks I hear some of you say, Must a Man afford himself no Leisure? I will tell thee, my friend, what Poor Richard says, Employ thy Time well, if thou meanest to gain Leisure; and, since thou art not sure of a Minute, throw not away an Hour. Leisure, is Time for doing something useful; this Leisure the diligent Man will obtain, but the lazy Man never; so that, as Poor Richard says, A Life of Leisure and a Life of Laziness are two things.\n\nKeep thy Shop, and thy Shop will keep thee; and again, If you would have your business done, go; if not, send.\n\nIf you would have a faithful Servant, and one that you like, serve yourself.\n\nA little Neglect may breed great Mischief: adding, for want of a Nail the Shoe was lost; for want of a Shoe the Horse was lost; and for want of a Horse the Rider was lost, being overtaken and slain by the Enemy; all for the want of Care about a Horse-shoe Nail.\n\nSo much for Industry, my Friends, and Attention to one's own Business; but to these we must add Frugality.\n\nWhat maintains one Vice, would bring up two Children. You may think perhaps, that a little Tea, or a little Punch now and then, Diet a little more costly, Clothes a little finer, and a little Entertainment now and then, can be no great Matter; but remember what Poor Richard says, Many a Little makes a Mickle.\n\nBeware of little expenses; A small Leak will sink a great Ship; and again, Who Dainties love, shall Beggars prove; and moreover, Fools make Feasts, and wise Men eat them.\n\nBuy what thou hast no Need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy Necessaries.\n\nIf you would know the Value of Money, go and try to borrow some; for, he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing.\n\nThe second Vice is Lying, the first is running in Debt.\n\nLying rides upon Debt's Back.\n\nPoverty often deprives a Man of all Spirit and Virtue: 'Tis hard for an empty Bag to stand upright.\n\nAnd now to conclude, Experience keeps a dear School, but Fools will learn in no other, and scarce in that; for it is true, we may give Advice, but we cannot give Conduct, as Poor Richard says: However, remember this, They that won't be counseled, can't be helped, as Poor Richard says: and farther, That if you will not hear Reason, she'll surely rap your Knuckles.\n\nTHE WHISTLE\n\nTo Madame Brillon\nPassy, November 10, 1779.\n\nI am charmed with your description of Paradise, and with your plan of living there; and I approve much of your conclusion, that, in the meantime, we should draw all the good we can from this world. In my opinion, we might all draw more good from it than we do, and suffer less evil, if we would take care not to give too much for whistles. For to me it seems, that most of the unhappy people we meet with, are become so by neglect of that caution.\n\nYou ask what I mean? You love stories, and will excuse my telling one of myself.\n\nWhen I was a child of seven year old, my friends, on a holiday, filled my pocket with coppers. I went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children; and being charmed with the sound of a whistle, that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered and gave all my money for one. I then came home, and went whistling all over the house, much pleased with my whistle, but disturbing all the family. My brothers, and sisters, and cousins, understanding the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth; put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the rest of the money; and laughed at me so much for my folly, that I cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure.\n\nThis, however, was afterwards of use to me, the impression continuing on my mind; so that often, when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing, I said to myself, Don't give too much for the whistle; and I saved my money.\n\nAs I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many, who gave too much for the whistle.\n\nWhen I saw one too ambitious of court favor, sacrificing his time in attendance on levees, his repose, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends, to attain it, I have said to myself, This man gives too much for his whistle.\n\nWhen I saw another fond of popularity, constantly employing himself in political bustles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by neglect, He pays, indeed, said I, too much for his whistle.\n\nIf I knew a miser who gave up every kind of comfortable living, all the pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteem of his fellow citizens, and the joys of benevolent friendship, for the sake of accumulating wealth, Poor man, said I, you pay too much for your whistle.\n\nWhen I met with a man of pleasure, sacrificing every laudable improvement of the mind, or of his fortune, to mere corporeal sensations, and ruining his health in their pursuit, Mistaken man, said I, you are providing pain for yourself, instead of pleasure; you give too much for your whistle.\n\nIf I see one fond of appearance, or fine clothes, fine houses, fine furniture, fine equipages, all above his fortune, for which he contracts debts, and ends his career in a prison, Alas! say I, he has paid dear, very dear, for his whistle.\n\nWhen I see a beautiful, sweet-tempered girl married to an ill-natured brute of a husband, What a pity, say I, that she should pay so much for a whistle!\n\nIn short, I conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their whistles.\n\nYet I ought to have charity for these unhappy people, when I consider, that, with all this wisdom of which I am boasting, there are certain things in the world so tempting, for example, the apples of King John, which happily are not to be bought; for if they were put to sale by auction, I might very easily be led to ruin myself in the purchase, and find that I had once more given too much for the whistle.\n\nAdieu, my dear friend, and believe me ever yours very sincerely and with unalterable affection,\n\nB. Franklin.\n\nA LETTER TO SAMUEL MATHER\n\nPassy, May 12, 1784.\n\nRevd Sir,\n\nIt is now more than 60 years since I left Boston, but I remember well both your father and grandfather, having heard them both in the pulpit, and seen them in their houses. The last time I saw your father was in the beginning of 1724, when I visited him after my first trip to Pennsylvania. He received me in his library, and on my taking leave showed me a shorter way out of the house through a narrow passage, which was crossed by a beam overhead. We were still talking as I withdrew, he accompanying me behind, and I turning partly towards him, when he said hastily, \"Stoop, stoop!\" I did not understand him, till I felt my head hit against the beam. He was a man that never missed any occasion of giving instruction, and upon this he said to me, \"You are young, and have the world before you; stoop as you go through it, and you will miss many hard thumps.\" This advice, thus beat into my head, has frequently been of use to me; and I often think of it, when I see pride mortified, and misfortunes brought upon people by their carrying their heads too high.\n\nB. Franklin.\n\nTHE END1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1707661", "artist_names": "Otis Redding", "full_title": "Respect by\u00a0Otis\u00a0Redding",

summer moon is on the rise\nAnd you're dancin' under starlit skies\nPlease don't let the stars get in your eyes\nJust save your heart for me\n[Bridge]\nWhen you're all alone, far away from home\nSomeone's gonna flirt with you\nI won't think it's wrong if you play along\nJust don't fall for someone new\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen the autumn winds begin to blow\nAnd the summertime is long ago\nYou'll be in my arms again I know\nSo, save your heart for me\nDarlin', save your heart for me\n\n[Interlude]\n*whistling*\n\n[Outro]\nPlease remember I'm in love with you so\nSave your heart for me\nDarlin', save your heart for meYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1607654", "artist_names": "Patty Duke", "full_title": "Don't Just Stand

Arms Again LyricsOooh\nAll day long I hear my telephone ring\nFriends calling giving their advice\nFrom the boy I love I should break away\nCause heartaches he'll bring one day\n\nI lost him once through friends' advice\nBut it's not gonna happen twice\nCause all advice ever gotten me\nWas many long and sleepless nights\nOoh!\nBut now he's back in my arms again\nRight by my side\nI got him back in my arms again\nSo satisfied\n\nIt's easy for friends to say let him go\nBut I'm the one who needs him so\nIt's his love that makes me strong\nWithout him I can't go on\n\nThis time I'll live my life at ease\nBeing happy lovin' whom I please\nAnd each time we make romance\nI'll be thankful for a second chance\n\nOoh!\nCause he's back in my arms again\nRight by my side\nI got him back in my arms again\nSo satisfied\nOoh!\n\nHow can Mary tell me what to do\nWhen she lost her love so true?\nAnd Flo, she don't know\nCause the boy she loves is a Romeo\nYou might also likeI listened once to my friends' advice\nBut it's not gonna happen twice\nCause all advice ever gotten me\nWas many long and sleepless nights\n\nOoh!\nI got him back in my arms again\nRight by my side\nI got him back in my arms again\nSo satisfied\n\nOoh!\nI'm satisfied, yeah\nSo satisfied\nI'm satisfied\nI'm satisfied\nSo satisfied\nI'm satisfied\nI'm satisfiedEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

me\nBut you`ve become\nA part of me\nEverywhere I go\nYour face I see\nEvery step I take\nYou take with me, yeah\nNowhere to run to, baby\nNowhere to hide\nGot nowhere to run to, baby\nNowhere to hide\n\nI know you're\nNo good for me\nBut free of you\nI'll never be, no\nEach night as I sleep\nInto my heart you creep\nI wake up feeling sorry I met you\nHoping soon that I'll forget you\nWhen I look in the mirror\nAnd comb my hair\nI see your face\nJust a-smiling there\n\n[Chorus]\nNowhere to run\nNowhere to hide\nGot nowhere to run to, baby\nNowhere to hide\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know you're\nNo good for me\nBut you've become\nA part of me\nHow can I fight a lover\nThat's sugar sweet\nWhen it's so deep, so deep\nDeep inside of me\nMy love reaches so high\nI can't get over it\nIt's so wide\nI can't get around it, no\nYou might also likeNowhere to run\nNowhere to hide\nFrom you, baby\nJust can't get away\nNo matter how I try\nI know you're no good for me\nBut free of you I'll never

right down and cry\n\nNow the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch\nHeartaches are goin' to the inside\nMy tears are holdin' back\nThey're tryin' not to fall\nMy heart's out of the runnin'\nTrue love's scratched for another's sake\nThe race is on and it looks like heartaches\nAnd the winner loses all\nOne day I ventured in love, never once suspectin'\nWhat the final results would be\nHow I lived in fear of wakin' up each mornin'\nAnd find that you're gone from me\nThere's ache and pain in my heart\nFor the name of the one that I'll never replaced\nSomebody new came up to win her\nAnd I came out in second place\n\nNow the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch\nHeartaches are goin' to the inside\nMy tears are holdin' back\nThey're tryin' not to fall\nMy

come here too\nHoping just by chance that I get a glimpse of you\nTrying hard to find you\nSomewhere I love\nHigh on a mountain of love\nA mountain of love\nA mountain of love\nYou should be ashamed\nWe used to be a mountain of love\nBut you just changed your name\n\nWay down below there's a half a million people\nSomewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple\nInside a church there's an altar filled with flowers\nWedding bells are ringing and they should have been ours\nThat's why I'm so lonely\nMy dreams gone above\nHigh on a mountain of love\n\n(Musical interlude)\n\nA mountain of love\nA mountain of love\nYou should be ashamed\nWe used to be a mountain of love\nBut you just changed your name\n\nWay down below there's a half a million people\nSomewhere there's a church with

LyricsOur story begins with the classic 007 opening, except this time it\u2019s Pierce Brosnan wearing the tux.\n1 - Ext. Top of Dam - Day\nA plane does a fly-by over a dam as a security gate slides open. A man in combat black runs across the top of the tall dam. He clips a rope to his ankle and the railing...and jumps off the side. As he sails down, he pulls out a gun-type thing and shoots it. A wire follows attaching in concrete and pulling the man down to....\n\u201cArchangel Chemical Weapons Facility, USSR\u201d\nCut to a laser burning through a metal wall, being shot by the man with the gunthing. We see a blue eye, but we haven\u2019t seen this guy\u2019s face yet.....\n2 - Int. Bathroom - Day\nInside the plant, we cut to the men\u2019s room, where we see Russians walking around. Above one of the stalls...\n\u201cMan in black\u2019s\u201d P.O.V. - a Soviet in uniform sitting on the can, reading a newspaper titled Pravda (\"The Truth\").\nThe man in black takes the steel grate out and we see a silhouette. Soviet\u2019s P.O.V. - The newspaper, printed in Russian, duh. He pulls the paper back to reveal.... James Bond. Hanging upside down from a vent. He flashes a grin.\nBOND: Beg your pardon, forgot to knock.\n007 punches out the Soviet and slips down.\n3 - Int. Hallway - Same time\nBond slips un-noticed through dim halls, wielding his Walther PPK with a silencer on it. He spots a butcher loading meat onto a cart, and he walks up to an opening where he sees soldiers eating. As he turns away...another dark shadow points a gun at him...and says something.\nSHADOW: (Russian) Where have you been? Where are your companions?\nBOND: I\u2019m alone.\nAlec Trevelyan, 006, steps into the light. He's around Bond's general age and built. Blond with cold eyes...\nALEC: Aren\u2019t we all? You\u2019re late 007.\nBOND: I had to stop in the bathroom.\nALEC: Ready to save the world again?\nBOND: After you, 006.\nThey remove another steel grate.\nALEC: James, for England.\nBOND: For England, Alec.\n4 - Int. Hall - Day\nBond\u2019s blue eyes spot someone in the hall. Waiting \u2018til the coast is clear, he jumps out of the vent in the floor while Alec climbs out. Both men walk down the hall. Alec enters a laboratory with a plate-glass window and shoots the guy inside. Meanwhile, Bond has a device plugged into and ID card slot with a number pad under it. He waits for a click,\nand the door unlocks. Both men walk inside....\n5 - Int. Gas room - Day\n...A room filled with nerve gas tanks.\nBOND: It\u2019s too easy.\nALEC: Half of everything is luck, James.\nAlec turns and plugs the device into the same panel, jamming the door.\nBOND: And the other half?\nALEC: Fate!\nA red light sounds, signaling the alarm of the plant. The men run down the stairs.\nALEC: Set timers to six minutes!\nBOND: Six minutes, check.\nA few Soviets burst through a door, 006 shoots them. Bond starts to arm a little explosive timer. A digital clock pops up...6.00. James and Alec scurry around behind the gas tanks planting the timers. An ugly-looking Soviet commander, Ourumov, stands behind a plexi-glass window.\nOURUMOV:  FIRE!\nSoldiers fire their guns, breaking the window. 006 and 007 are still planting the timers.\nALEC: Closing time, James! Last call!\nBOND: Buy me a pint!\nThe Soviets pour through the opening. Trevelyan fires at them.\nOURUMOV (O.S.): I am Colonel Ourumov. Come out with your hands above your heads!\nWhile planting a timer...\nBOND: How original.\nMore Soviets pour through a door.\nBOND: Shut the door, Alec! There\u2019s a draft!\nNo answer.\nBOND: Alec?!\nHe looks for 006. Alec in kneeling under the gun of Ourumov. Thirty soldiers all have their guns pointed at Bond.\nOURUMOV:  Move out! Throw down your weapon and walk towards me. Slowly.\nALEC: Finish the job, James! Blow them all to hell!\nOURUMOV:  You have 10 seconds. 10...9...8...\nBond goes back to the detonator he just planted and sets it for 3.00.\nOURUMOV:  ....7...6..5...4..\nBond throws his weapon on the floor, puts his hands behind his head and approaches Ourumov.\nOURUMOV:  ...3......2....\nALEC: For England, James!!\nBOOM. Alec is silenced. He flops over. The Soviet soldiers fire their automatic rifles.\nBond retreats behind the tanks again.\nOURUMOV:  Hold your fire! You\u2019ll blow the gas tanks!\nThey do. Bond recovers his gun.\nOURUMOV:  This is your last chance! Come out with your hands above your head....\nOurumov\u2019s P.O.V. - a dark shadow moves behind a cart with tanks piled on it. The soldiers raise their guns...\nOURUMOV:  WAIT!\nBond moves slowly with the cart acting as a shield. Ourumov seems amused....one soldier thinks he can get a shot off...and fires. Bond retreats farther behind the cart. Ourumov turns and shoots the guy in the face...he warned him.\nOURUMOV:  You can\u2019t win.\nYeah, sure. Bond quickly hits the \u201con\u201d button to a conveyer belt leading outside. He jumps on and fires the assault rifle. The Soviets fire back, but Bond hits the grate to a storage area above their heads. More gas tanks pour out on the Soviets. And Bond tumbles down the conveyer belt onto...\n6 - Ext. Runway - Day\nBond sees a small plane....his ticket outta here. More soldiers burst through a hangar door and what\u2019s behind door number 2...even more pour out onto the runway. Bond crouches behind some piping and fires, hitting a few. The gun runs out and he dashes through the snow toward the plane. We hear Ourumov\u2019s shouting in the backround.\nOURUMOV:  Hold your fire!\nCut to 1000 yards out: the facility is on a mountain-top. Cliffs, very high up. Back to the action...Bond runs down the plane and drags himself inside, fights with the pilot. Now there\u2019s soldiers chasing Bond on motorcycles. Both 007 and the pilot tumble out of the plane. A motorcycle runs over the pilot, causing the bike to throw its rider. Bond\njumps on the bike and chases the runaway plane.\nOURUMOV:  WAIT!!\nThe plane sails off the cliff, and so does the motorcycle with 007 still on it. He flies off the bike and sails to the dive-bombing plane. He grabs the open door and pulls himself inside and into the pilot\u2019s seat. Uh-oh! The stick\u2019s not working, not responding! Oh crap!\nWe see Bond\u2019s blue eyes start to panic...then just in time the plane soars upward as the chemical weapons facility explodes.\nFade up on...\n\nTitle Sequence, scored by \u201cGoldenEye\u201d sung by Tina Turner\n\n7 - Int. Car/Ext. Road - Day\nWe shoot onto an open road with the vrroom of an engine behind us. James\u2019 personal choice of car, a silver Aston Martin DB5, license plate BMT 216A. The DB5 swerves around a tight corner at 90 mph. Fade up title...\n\u201cNine Years Later\u201d\nBond, of course, is behind the wheel and a young woman sits beside him, visibly agitated. Her name is Caroline, but it doesn\u2019t come up in the text.\nCAROLINE: James, is it really necessary to drive quite so fast?!\nBOND: More often than you\u2019d think.\nA red Ferrari comes into view in the rear mirror.\nCAROLINE: I enjoy a spirited ride as much as the next girl...\nJames flashes an intoxicating grin...as the Ferrari pulls up beside him. There\u2019s a beautiful brunette behind the wheel. James loves this...\nCAROLINE: Who\u2019s that?\nBOND: The next girl.\nThe Ferrari passes him and plays a little road rash...nearly crashing into an oncoming tractor, spinning out of the way. James is loving every minute. Caroline is now really pissed off...\nCAROLINE: James, stop this! Stop it! I know what you\u2019re doing...\nBOND: Really? What\u2019s that, dear?\nCAROLINE: You\u2019re just trying to show off the size of your...your...\nBOND: Engine?\nCAROLINE: Ego.\nBOND: Here we are having a pleasant drive in the country and you\u2019ve got to bring psychology into it.\nCAROLINE: Well, I was just sent out here to evaluate you.\nBOND: Let\u2019s try and put that behind us, shall we?\nThe DB5 and Ferrari are still doin\u2019 90 around a corner when a pack of cyclists are pedaling up a hill. 007 let\u2019s the car pass him...\nBOND: Ladies first.\nCaroline seems to be praying. The red Ferrari brushes past the first biker, knocking him down and the rest fall over in succession. Caroline\u2019s had enough.\nCAROLINE: James, I want you to stop this car!\nBOND: Really?\nCAROLINE: STOP THIS CAR AT ONCE!!\nJames pulls the brake and the car screeches to a halt. He puts his arm around her.\nBOND: As you can see, I have no problem with female authority.\nShe flips open a box with two glasses and a bottle of Bollinger champagne in it. She looks pleased for once.\nCAROLINE: James, you\u2019re incorrigible. What am I going to do with you?\nHe moves in closer....\nBOND: Let\u2019s toast your evaluation, shall we?\nThey kiss...\nBOND: A very...thorough...evaluation.\nShe giggles, they kiss and we pan up on the skyline of Monte Carlo.\n8 - Ext. Posh party - Night\nThe Astor Martin DB5 drives up to a elegant-looking hotel, with a parking valet.\nVALET: (French) Good evening Mr. Bond. Nice to see you tonight.\nBOND: (French) Good evening, Pierre. How are things?\nValet: (French) Very good, and you?\nBond steps out of the DB5, looking dashing as usual in a tailored tuxedo, his black hair combed back. He spots the red Ferrari, parked. He enters the casino.\n8 - Int. Hotel/Casino - Night\nBond enters a ritzy lobby and nears a baccarat table. The dealer and a couple of people sit around playing.\nDEALER: Sept \u00e0 la banque. Ma\u2019dam wins.\nWe pan up on the driver of the expensive Italian sports car, who wears a black dress. Her name is Xenia Onatopp.\nDEALER: Mademoiselle? Monsieurs. Ladies and Gentlemen? Players.\nBond sits down at the table as Xenia is lighting up a cigar.\nBOND: Banko.\nThey proceed to play the game.\nBOND: It appears we share the same passions. Well, three anyway.\nXENIA:  I count two. Motoring and...uh...baccarat.\nShe shows he cards\nDEALER: Huit \u00e0 la banque.\nBond shows his cards.\nDEALER: Seven. Ma\u2019dam wins.\nXENIA:  I hope the third is where your real talent lies.\nBOND: One rises to meet a challenge.\nThey place their bets.\nXENIA:  Doubler.\nBOND: Suivi.\nThe dealer nods his head and passes cards. Bond looks at them.\nBOND: Carte.\nXenia shows her cards.\nDEALER: Ma\u2019dam stands with five.\nBond shows his cards.\nDEALER: Six. Ma\u2019dam loses.\nXenia is obviously mad.\nXENIA:  (Russian)Dammit! (English) Enjoy it. While it lasts.\nBOND: The very words I live by.\nShe gets up from the table. James follows.\nBOND: And what words do you live by?\nXENIA:  The trick is to quit while you\u2019re still ahead.\nBOND: That\u2019s one trick I never learned.\nHe signals for a waiter to come over.\nBOND: Perhaps you\u2019ll show me how it\u2019s done.\nThe waiter approaches them. Here we go folks....\nBOND: Vodka Martini. Shaken, not stirred. And for you?\nXENIA:  The same.\nBond is entranced.\nBOND: How do you take it?\nXENIA:  Straight up. With a twist.\nThe waiter scurries away. Xenia fingers her cigar. So, she likes to play...\nXENIA:  Thank you, Mr....\nBOND: The name\u2019s Bond. James Bond.\nXENIA:  Xenia Zargeneva Onatopp.\nBOND: Onatopp?\nXENIA:  Onatopp.\nBOND: Your accent, Georgian?\nXENIA:  Very good Mr. Bond. You\u2019ve been to Russia?\nBOND: Not recently, I used to drop in occasionally. Shoot in and out.\nXENIA:  It\u2019s very different now. The land of opportunity.\nBOND: With a new Ferrari in every garage?\nXENIA:  No, not quite. That belongs to a friend.\nBOND: A tip for your friend: the French registration plates for this year\u2019s models start with the letter \u2018L\u2019. Even the counterfeit ones.\nXenia is startled.\nXENIA:  Oh, and what rank do you hold with the Motor Vehicles Department, Mr. Bond?\nBOND: Commander.\nNow a man steps up to Xenia. He\u2019s a bald dude with a red beard. Looks like a  Canadian Admiral.\nADMIRAL: Should we go?\nXENIA:  This one is an Admiral.\nBOND: I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank.\nXENIA:  Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.\nShe sounds really annoyed, and she storms away with the Canadian. Bond watches her.\nBOND: The pleasure, I\u2019m sure, was all mine.\n9 - Ext. Amphitheater - Night\nPeople are gathered on stone benches in an open amphitheater watching two ladies perform an act. One woman hands a rose to another girl dressed as a porcelain doll. The lady proceeds to control the \u2018doll\u2019 as she walks like a puppet over to a man in the audience. He takes it and the audience claps. Meanwhile, Bond walks up the stone stairs to the top of the theater, overlooking water. Bond\u2019s P.O.V. - the Ferrari pulls up, and Xenia and the Admiral get out. Bond takes out a camera-thing from his pocket, and zooming in, he takes a picture of Xenia and the Canadian boarding a motorboat to take her to a yacht. Bond takes a picture of the boat - \u2018Manticore\u2019- and walks back to his DB5.\n10 - Ext. DB5 / Int. DB5 - Night\nBefore Bond gets into his car, he notices a very sophisticated, stealthy helicopter perched on top of a battleship. He gets in the car and pushes a button on the stereo. A piece of paper with the info of the pictures he just took. A voice starts...it\u2019s Moneypenny. Bond looks at the pictures.\nMONEYPENNY: (V.O.) Transmission begins from Monypenny. Identification confirmed. Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter pilot. Current suspected links to the Janus crime syndicate, St. Petersburg. Yacht Manticore is leased to a known Janus corporate front. M authorizes you to observe Miss Onatopp but stipulates no...contact...without prior\napproval. End transmission, Moneypenny. Good night, James. I trust you\u2019ll stay...onatopp of things.\nBond smirks. He knows exactly what she means. So do we....\n11 - Int. Yacht Manticore - Night\nXenia literally JUMPS on the Admiral. She\u2019s in some black lingerie. They kiss ferociously, she bites him. Then she whispers something, flips him over and crushes his rib cage with her legs. The Admiral\u2019s in a lot of PAIN.\nADMIRAL: Xenia! I can\u2019t BREATHE!!!\nXenia grins and squeezes harder. A hand reaches into the Admiral\u2019s coat, which is draped over a chair, and pulls out his Department of Defense ID card.\n12 - Ext. Bay - Day\nA motorboat speeds through the water.\n13 - Ext. Yacht Manticore - Day\nBond waits for a man in a striped shirt to pass before he jumps up on to the deck on the yacht. He walks toward a sliding glass door, opens it and enters.\n14 - Int. Yacht Manticore - Day\nFurnished with leather furniture, Bond makes his way to a window where he sees the motorboat speeding to the battleship with the chopper on the deck. He looks down into a brass doorknob and sees the reflection of the guy in the striped shirt coming at him. Bond spins around with a towel and knocks him down, then throws him down the stairs by wrapping the towel around his head. 007 wipes his face with the towel.\n15 - Ext. Battleship - Day\nAcross the bay, cars let off Naval, Army and Air Force Officers of different countries, as well as their escorts. A gloved hand shows the Admiral\u2019s ID card for the Department of National Defense. We\u2019re pretty sure it isn\u2019t the Admiral... A band plays, officers mill around. The Captain salutes the \u2018Admiral\u2019.\nCAPTAIN: My respects, Admiral.\nThe officer kisses the hand of Xenia, who is standing beside the \u2018Admiral\u2019.\nCAPTAIN: Delighted to have you aboard, mademoiselle.\nAn emcee starts to talk.\nM.C.: Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats on the upper deck for the demonstration of the aircraft.\n16 - Int. Yacht - Day\nBond is still looking around the boat, this time with the Walther drawn. He bursts through a door, looks in a cabinet. He\u2019s in a bedroom now. James opens the closet door and...  The dead body of Admiral Chuck Farrel falls stiffly to the floor, naked. Bond is a little stunned...\n17 - Ext. Yacht - Day\nBond hops into a motorboat docked beside the yacht. He starts it up and drives toward the warship.\n18 - Ext. Battleship - Day\nWe see the chopper up close now...jeez! air-to-air missiles, heat-seekers, guns up the wazoo...the whole nine yards.\nM.C.: What you are about to see in operation is Europe\u2019s answer to the electronic battlefield. The first working prototype of the Tiger helicopter. Uniquely maneuverable, the Tiger not only uses stealth technology, it is the only helicopter to be hardened against all forms of electronic interference, radio jamming and electro-magnetic radiation.\n19 - Int. Hall - Day\nTwo pilots in blue flight suits, clutching helmets make their way outside to the chopper. They are stopped by Xenia, wearing a revealing dress. She whistles to get their attention. The pilots turn. She speaks seductively...\nXENIA:  Shh. I have a small surprise from your friends back at the barracks.\nOne pilot turns to the other and grins.\nPILOT: I think I\u2019ve gone to Heaven!\nXENIA:  Not yet.\nShe whips out a pistol and shoots both of them. Xenia is shown next wearing one of the blue flight suits and the helmet with the visor down.\n20 - Ext. Landing Pad - Day\nM.C. (O.S.): Now let\u2019s welcome the pilots...Lt. Commander Bernard Jobert and Lt. Francois Bruse.\nThe \u2018pilots\u2019 wave and board the helicopter. Bond is now on the warship RUNNING toward the Tiger, but he is pushed against the wall by 2 burly guards. They all watch the Tiger take off. Fade out....\n21 - Ext. Northern Russia - Evening\nA dog team runs through the snow near...Fade up title...\n\u201cSpace Weapons Control Centre, Severnaya, Russia\u201d\nA desolate area, wind blowing snow around a building with a HUGE satellite dish on top of it.\n22 - Int. Weapons Centre - Evening\nA bunch of monitors, computers, electronic map of the world occupy the area. We hear a voice..\nWOMAN (O.S.): Select MIR. Autographic projection.\nWe pan to the right to reveal Natalya Simonova, a beautiful computer programmer, seated at a computer with postcards of a tropical beach taped to the side.\nNATALYA: Compute possible intercept with second stage geo-set two.\nWhatever that means. We show the monitor. Up pops a window \u201cEnter Password\u201d along with a graphic of a woman in a bikini. Natalya sighs and looks at a guy in a chair, playing with a pen like an idiot. Leather jacket, greasy hair, wire-rim glasses. This program was obviously designed by this dude. Natalya looks to the woman behind her.\nNATALYA: Anna.\nAnna looks up from her monitor and is obviously disgusted.\nANNA: He wouldn\u2019t know a woman if one came up and sat on his head!\nNatalya laughs.\nNATALYA: Bor-ris!\nBoris is still playing with the pen.\nNATALYA: BORIS!\nBORIS: What?\nShe signals to her monitor.\nBORIS: I thought I\u2019d post it on the Internet, no?\nNATALYA: What\u2019s the password?\nBORIS: I made it easy this time. Even you should be able to break it, borsht-for-brains. Alright, alright, I\u2019ll give you a hint. They\u2019re right in front of you, and can open very large doors.\nShe types in \u201cKnockers\u201d.\nNATALYA: You\u2019re such a geek.\nWe hear an alarm. They turn to Boris\u2019 computer.\nBORIS: Yes! I\u2019m in!\nHe rolls over to his P.C. and grins.\nNATALYA: You\u2019ve hacked into the U.S. Department on Justice. You know what will happen if they trace it here?\nBORIS: The Chief of Computers will call me a genius, move me to Moscow, and give me a million bucks hard currency. I think not. Besides, the Americans are slugheads, they\u2019ll never detect me.\nUp pops a window \u201cUnauthorized Access Detected\u201d.\nNATALYA: You\u2019re saying, slughead.\nBORIS: Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko.\nHe types something and up pops a window \u201cSend Spike\u201d.\nBORIS: Spiked them!\nNATALYA: Come on, Boris...\nBORIS: No way! I spiked them!\n\u201cInitiate Search Program. Enter Password\u201d.\nNATALYA: Alright, what\u2019s the password?\nBORIS: I\u2019m not going to tell you.\nNATALYA: OK, let me guess. It\u2019s not in front of me?\nBoris shakes his head.\nBORIS: You sit on it, but you can\u2019t take it with you.\nBoris types in 5 characters. A map pops up on-screen. A red line connects cities.\nBORIS: My program seizes the phone line of whoever\u2019s tracing me and jams their modem so they get hung up. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.\nAn F.B.I. screen pops up.\nBORIS: Whoo!\nHe types....\nBORIS: \u201cBetter luck next time, Slugheads!\u201d BAM! GONE! I am invincible!!\nBoris leaps up triumphantly with his arms in the air. Other technicians just look at him. He turns to Natalya.\nBORIS: Was it good for you, too?\nShe\u2019s annoyed with him.\nNATALYA: I\u2019m getting some coffee.\nShe walks away.\nBORIS: I\u2019m going for a cigarette.\n23 - Ext. Facility - Evening\nA sliding door opens and Boris outside with a parka on. Buurrr! Cold! He bites a beat-up cigarette and lights a zippo. The lighter blows out, and Boris looks up and sees... The Tiger helicopter fighting the wind, landing in the snow. The cockpit opens, Xenia and Ourumov jump out.\n24 - Int. Severnaya Kitchen - Evening\nNatalya is getting a cup of coffee.\n25 - Int. Hallway - Evening\nXenia and Ourumov walk down a hallway and stop at a little box on the wall: a voice-identification system.\nOURUMOV:  General Akadi Gregorovich Ourumov, head of Space Division.\nA door opens. Xenia and Ourumov enter...\n26 - Int. Severnaya Control Room - Evening\nA soldier hurries to address the General. He salutes.\nMAJOR: General, if I\u2019d known...\nOURUMOV:  You\u2019d have been ready. This is an unscheduled test of the Severnaya facility, Major. War simulation. We are going to test via GoldenEye. Report the status.\nMAJOR: Two operational satellites, Sir. Petya and Mischa. Both in 90 minute Earth orbit at 100 kilometers.\nOURUMOV:  Good.\nHe takes out an authority card.\nOURUMOV: Here is the authorization code. Now the GoldenEye and today\u2019s access numbers for satellite Petya, please.\nHe looks at his watch.\nOURUMOV:  I am timing you.\nThe Major scurries away, slides the card through a slot and presses his hand on an ID pad. The metal wall opens...revealing a square disk with a large golden crystal in the center: The GoldenEye. The Major takes the GoldenEye and two keys from its safe and hands them to the General.\nOURUMOV:  Good. Thank you, Major.\nNatalya notices something is going on from her position in the kitchen. Xenia cocks an automatic rifle and shoots every technician in the room. She is visibly enjoying herself. Natalya is still in the kitchen, scared to death. Bodies of her co-workers lay everywhere. Ourumov walks toward a large control panel and slides the GoldenEye in a slot, and\nhands a key to Xenia. They slide the keys in...\nOURUMOV:  On my count...3...2...1!\nThey turn the keys at the same time. It activates the electronic map on the wall.\nOURUMOV:  Set target. Severnaya.\nXenia types in something. Russia lights up in red.\nOURUMOV:  Arm the weapon.\nShe types once again. Ourumov flips a plastic cover and twists the red dial inside.\n27 - Space\nA satellite in orbit breaks off its protective cover. CCCP is printed on the side.\n28 - Int. Control Room - Evening\nXenia types in a firing code.\n29 - Space\nThe satellite spreads its thrusters.\n30 - Int. Control Room - Evening\nAn alarm sounds \u201cWeapon Armed\u201d. They hear a noise, and Natalya runs back into the kitchen.\nOURUMOV:  Check it.\nXenia grabs her gun and runs down to a person who managed to send a distress signal. She shoots him again.\n31 - Int. Kitchen - Evening\nNatalya notices a vent in the ceiling. Maybe she can escape that way....\n32 - Int. Control Room - Evening\nOURUMOV:  Their best response time is 19 minutes. They\u2019ll be late.\n33 - Ext. Russian Air Base - Evening\nThree pilots sprint to their aircrafts while an alarm sounds.\n34 - Int. Control Room - Evening\nXenia decides to check the kitchen. She notices some spilled coffee. She bends down and touches it, still hot. She spots the opened vent in the ceiling and fires at it. Meanwhile, Ourumov secures the GoldenEye and keys inside a briefcase. Both walk out.\nXENIA:  It\u2019s clean. I had to ventilate someone.\nWe see a digital timer counting down.\n35 - Space\nThe satellite moves into position.\n36 - Ext. Facility - Evening\nXenia and the General load into the chopper and take off.\n37 - Ext. Air base - Evening\nThe three MiGs take off.\n38 - Ext. MI6 building - Night\nWe see the MI6 building as a double-decker bus passes.\n39 - Int. Moneypenny\u2019s office - Night\nBond makes his way to Miss Moneypenny\u2019s office. She\u2019s inside wearing an elegant black dress. James loves this.\nBOND: Good evening, Moneypenny.\nShe looks up and sees James standing in the doorway.\nMONEYPENNY: Good evening, James. M will meet you in the situation room. I\u2019m to take you straight in.\nShe walks past him. He watches.\nBOND: I\u2019ve never seen you after hours, Moneypenny, lovely.\nMONEYPENNY: Thank you, James.\nBOND: Out on some professional assignment? Dressing to kill?\nThey start to walk down a hall.\nMONEYPENNY: I know you\u2019ll find this crushing, 007, but I don\u2019t sit at home every night praying for some international incident so I can run down here all dressed up to impress James Bond. I was on a date, if you must know, with a gentleman. We went to the theater together.\nShe presses a few buttons.\nBOND: Moneypenny, I\u2019m devastated. What would I ever do without you?\nMONEYPENNY: As far as I can remember, James, you\u2019ve never had me.\nThe elevator stops and they step out. Bond moves in closer.\nBOND: Hope, spring is eternal.\nMONEYPENNY: You know, this sort of behavior could qualify as sexual harassment.\nBOND: Really, what\u2019s the penalty for that?\nMONEYPENNY: Someday you have to make good on your innuendoes.\nAnother door slides open. James keeps staring at her.\nBOND: After you, Moneypenny.\nMONEYPENNY: No, I insist. You first.\nBond walks through the door into...\n40 - Int. Situation room - Night\nCommon \u201cSituation Room\u201d. Satellite photo on the wall, computers, monitors everywhere.\nBill Tanner approaches Bond.\nTANNER: Good Evening, Mr. Bond.\nBOND: Tanner, What\u2019s up?\nTANNER: Sixteen minutes ago, we intercepted a distress call from a supposedly abandoned radar station at Severnaya. Look what the satellite picked up.\nWe see a satellite photo on a computer monitor. Pictured is what looks like a bird\u2019s-eye-view of a helicopter. They zoom in on the image.\nTANNER (O.S.): We found a match. Your missing Tiger.\nThe computer does a scan of the aircraft.\nBOND (O.S.): In the middle of northern Russia.\nTANNER: Seems like your hunch was right, 007. Too bad the evil queen of numbers won\u2019t let you play it.\nBond clears his throat, signaling that she\u2019s right behind him. Tanner cringes, and turns around...slowly. There\u2019s M. A woman with short gray hair, face as hard as stone and a disposition to match.\nM: You were saying?\nTANNER: No, I was just...uh...\nM: Good, because if I want sarcasm, Mr. Tanner, I\u2019ll talk to my children, thank you very much. (Pause) Good evening, 007.\nBOND: Good evening, M.\nM: The Prime Minister\u2019s waiting for an update. Proceed with your briefing, Mr. Tanner.\nTANNER: Thank you. After the distress signal, your helicopter took off, and the Russians scrambled these three MiGs here to intercept it.\nHe walks to the satellite photo on the wall.\nBOND (O.S.): What do you think the Russians were using the base for?\nTANNER: Well at one point, we suspected that Severnaya might be the ground station for a secret space-based weapon system called GoldenEye, but...\nM: Our statistical analysis saw they had neither the finance or technology to implement it.\nBOND: Numbers were never my strong suite.\nM just stares at him.\nBOND: Are these pictures live?\nTanner starts to say something when...\nM: Unlike the American government, we prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.\n41 - Ext. Russian sky - Night\nThe three MiGs soar through the sky at Mach 2.\n42 - Int. Severnaya kitchen - Night\nWe see a cabinet door open, a pair of eyes peek out. Natalya crawls out.\n43 - Ext.

Severnaya - Night\nA surge ripples though the ground and the dish begins to short circuit.\n47 - Int. Severnaya - Night\nElectrical explosions fill the room, and Natalya runs and dives under a metal staircase.\n48 - Int. MI6 Situation Room - Night\nThe satellite picture on the wall fizzles out. Nothing but static.\nTANNER: What the bloody hell was that?\nM is in deep thought.\n49 - Ext. Russian sky - Night\nThe MiGs start to short circuit, all the controls go haywire, the pilot screams. The jet goes down, two explode in mid-air. The third is still careening toward the dish. It crashes into it and explodes.\n50 - Int. Severnaya -Night\nA pipe breaks right next to Natalya\u2019s head. She leaps up from her hiding place, screaming. She trips on a body and falls. Above her, the rig holding up a bunch of TV monitors comes crashing down, and stops just before crushing her.\n51 - Ext. Severnaya - Night\nThe dish is still exploding....\n52 - Int. Severnaya - Night\nNatalya covers up Anna with a cloth. She\u2019s crying now as she walks to the little voice ID box in the hallway.\nNATALYA: Natalya Fiodorovna Simonova.\nThe bars don\u2019t move, duh, the box is obviously busted.\nNATALYA: NATALYA FIODOROVNA SIMONOVA!!!\nShe hears a creak above her. She looks up and walks away. The dish comes CRASHING down, through the roof! Natalya\u2019s really scared now...but...\n53 - Ext. Severnaya - Night\nNatalya climbs out the newly revealed exit. From afar we see her, surrounded by fire.\nNATALYA: Boris!? Boris!?\n54 - Int. MI6 Situation Room - Night\nTanner\u2019s on the phone.\nTANNER: Thanks.\nHe hangs up.\nTANNER: Our satellite\u2019s knocked out. So are two of the Americans\u2019. We have another coming into range...now.\nThe satellite picture on the wall comes back on.\nTANNER: Good God. Two of the MiGs are down...\nThey look at a monitor.\nM: And it looks like the third went into the dish.\nM turns to Bond, who is still studying the wall.\nM: What do you think?\nBOND: No lights. Not one single electric light on a thirty-mile radius. (Pause) EMP?\nTANNER: Would account for the MiGs and the satellite.\nBOND: And the blackout.\nTanner turns to M.\nTANNER: Electro-Magnetic Pulse. First strike satellite weapon developed by the...uh..\nM: The Americans and Soviets during the Cold War. I read the brief. Discovered after Hiroshima. Set off a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere, creates a pulse; a radiation surge that destroys everything with an electronic circuit.\nTANNER: The idea being to knock out the enemy\u2019s communication before he, she or they could retaliate.\nM: So, GoldenEye exists.\nBOND: Yes.\nM: Could this be an accident?\nBOND: No. The helicopter. If you wanted to steal the GoldenEye it\u2019s the perfect getaway vehicle. Setting off the blast was the ideal way to wipe out any trace of the crime.\nM: The Janus Group?\nBOND: They may have been involved with the helicopter.\nHe moves to a computer.\nBOND: I know the Russian fail-safe systems. You just can\u2019t walk in and ask for the keys to he bomb. You need the access codes.\nOn the computer, James zooms in on a small white object, moving. It appears to be a person. (It\u2019s Natalya)\nBOND (O.S.): There had to be an insider.\nHe looks closer at the monitor.\nBOND: And at least one person probably knows who it is.\n55 - Ext. Severnaya - Night\nNatalya falls into the snow. She hears sled dogs, she runs toward them. We see a dog team.\n56 - Int. M\u2019s Office - Night\nM is on the phone.\nM: Very well, Sir. Thank you, good night.\nShe hangs up and turns to Bond.\nM: The Prime Minister\u2019s talked to Moscow. They\u2019re saying it was an accident during a routine training exercise.\n007 is seated in a chair, hands folded neatly\nBOND: Governments change. The lies stay the same.\nM walks around from behind her desk.\nM: What else do we know about the Janus Syndicate?\nBOND: Top-flight arms dealers headquartered in St. Petersburg. First outfit to reach north the Iraqis during the Gulf War. Their head man in unreliably described, no photographs. The woman, Onatopp, is our only confirmed contact.\nM: Would you care for a drink?\nBOND: Um...thank you. Your predecessor kept some Cognac in the top drawer\u2026\nM: I prefer Bourbon.\nShe pours the drinks.\nM: Ice?\nBOND: Yes.\nShe hands a glass to him.\nM: We pulled the files on anyone who might had access or authority at Severnaya. Top name on our list is a friend of yours, I understand...\nShe sits at her desk and presses a button. A screen in back of her appears with Ourumov\u2019s ugly face on it.\nBOND: Ourumov. They made him a general.\nM: He sees himself as the next \u2018I\u2019 man if Russia. Which is why our political analysts rule him out. He doesn\u2019t fit the profile of a traitor.\nBond is a little annoyed...\nBOND: Are these the same analysts who said GoldenEye couldn\u2019t exist, who said the helicopter posed no immediate threat, and wasn\u2019t worth following?!\nM: You don\u2019t like me, Bond. You don\u2019t like my methods. You think I\u2019m an accountant, a bean counter, more interested in my members than your instincts.\nBOND: The thought had occurred to me.\nM: Good, because I think you\u2019re a sexist, misogynist dinosaur. A relic of the Cold War, whose boyish charms though wasted on me obviously appeal to the young woman I sent out to evaluate you.\nBond takes a sip of his drink.\nBOND: Point taken.\nM: Not quite, 007.\nShe\u2019s got his attention.\nM: If you think for one moment I don\u2019t have the balls to send a man out to die, your instincts are dead wrong. I have no compunction about sending you to your death. But I won\u2019t do it on a whim. Even with your cavalier attitude toward life.\nShe leans forward on her desk...\nM: I want you to find GoldenEye, find who took it, what they plan to do with it and stop it. And if you should come across Ourumov, guilty or not, I don\u2019t want you running off on some kind of vendetta. Avenging Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.\nBOND: You didn\u2019t get him killed.\nM: Neither did you. Don\u2019t make it personal.\nBOND: (mumbles) Never.\nHe finishes his drink and gets up. He\u2019s had enough of this...\nM (O.S.): Bond.\nJames turns. M smirks.\nM: Come back alive.\n57 - Ext. St. Petersburg square - Day\nA band plays in a square outside The Winter Palace, the residence of the Russian Czar until 1918.\n58 - Int. Building - Day\nDefense Minister Dimitri Mishkin watches the band marching from a window. A serious-looking dude with a gotee. He glances at his watch, then retreats back to a table with a board of councilors seated. There\u2019s a knock at the door. Gen. Ourumov enters and removes his hat.\nMISHKIN: Good morning, General Ourumov.\nOURUMOV:  Defense Minister Mishkin, Gentlemen.\nMISHKIN: Please, deliver your report.\nOURUMOV:  As this council is aware, 72 hours ago, a secret weapons program codename GoldenEye was detonated over Severnaya. As head of Space Division, I personally undertook the investigation. I have concluded this crime was committed by Siberian separatists, seeking to create political unrest. Incredibly the peaceful work and much needed hard currency earnings of Severnaya have been set back by several years. Therefore, I tender my resignation.\nThe council makes some noise, shaking their heads \"Niet\" \"No\".\nMISHKIN: It seems the council does not want your head, Akadi Gregorovich, merely your loyal assurance that there are no other GoldenEye satellites.\nOURUMOV:  I can\u2019t give you that assurance, Defense Minister.\nMISHKIN: And what of the two missing Severnaya technicians?\nOurumov freezes. Two?! Where did two come from?!\nOURUMOV:  I was aware only of the one. Boris Grishenko.\nMishkin glances at a paper...\nMISHKIN: There was a girl, also, whose body was not among the dead. Natalya Fivoriva Simonova, a level-two programmer.\nOURUMOV:  I will investigate immediately, Defense Minister.\nMISHKIN: It would seem presumptuous, General, to blame this incident on Siberian separatists before the whereabouts of your own people are determined.\nThe Council looks like a bunch of statues.\nMISHKIN: Do you agree?\nOURUMOV:  YES, Defense Minister. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.\nMISHKIN: That will be all.\nThe General snaps to attention and puts his hat back on, then exits.\n59 - Int. Q Branch - Day, I think...\nBond makes his way to Q\u2019s test lab. The room is full of technicians working on all sorts of gadgets. Q himself wheels up in a wheelchair with a cast on his left leg.\nBOND: Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing?\nA rocket fires from the cast, exploding in a bright flash.\nQ: Hunting!\nAcross the room a parachute discharges from a BMW. Q and 007 walk toward the car.\nQ: Right! Now pay attention, 007. First, your new car. BMW. Agile five-forward gears, all points radar. Self-destruct system, and naturally, all the usual refinements.\nAs Q talks, James opens the car door. Blue BMW Z3 Roadster convertible. James proceeds to bug the technician working on the car. He is, of course, not listening to Q.\nQ: Now this, I\u2019m particularly proud of: behind the headlights - Stinger missiles.\nBond is now listening...\nBOND: Excellent! Just the thing for unwinding after a rough day at the office.\nQ: Need I remind you, 007, that you have a license to kill - NOT to break the traffic laws.\nBOND: I wouldn\u2019t think of it.\nQ: Good! Right, let\u2019s get on to more practical methods.\nThey walk to a table. Bond disappears off-screen. Q picks up a belt.\nQ: A typical leather belt. Male size 34, buckle - notch.\nWe see Bond now, he\u2019s playing with a laptop, not listening as usual.\nQ: Are you finished?\nJames quickly closes the laptop, pauses...\nBOND: Yes.\nQ: Good! A typical leather belt...\nBOND: Q! I\u2019m familiar with that device.\nQ: Not one with a 75-foot repelling cord built into the buckle. Fire, and out shoots a pitot followed by a high tensile wire designed to support your weight.\nBOND: I see. And what if I need additional support?\nQ: It\u2019s tested for one, 007.\nBehind them, a guy in a white lab coat enters a fake phone booth. An air-bag thing inflates, trapping the guy inside. Bond and Q could care less. Q picks up an envelope Bond has been carrying with him. An x-ray of the envelope appears on a monitor. Looks like a plane ticket. British Airways.\nQ: Flight 878 to St. Petersburg.\nQ taps a mirrored table.\nQ: X-ray document scanner.\nHe takes out a \u2018clickey pen\u2019 (ya know the kind you have to click to use).\nQ: A pen. This is a class-4 grenade. Three clicks arms the four second fuse, another three disarms it.\nAs he talks, Q demonstrates the clicks. Bond grabs the pen and clicks it three times.\nBOND: How long did you say the fuse was?\nQ grabs it back, and disarms it.\nQ: Oh, grow up 007.\nBOND: Who said the pen was mightier than the sword?\nQ: Thanks to me, they were right!\nQ walks toward a test dummy while the man stuck in the telephone booth is being wheeled away.\nQ: Look, let\u2019s ask Fred here to demonstrate for us.\nHe clips the pen in \u201cFred\u2019s\u201d pocket as the guy trapped in the phone booth is wheeled away.\nQ: Here we are. Sorry about this Fred...\nQ clicks the pen three times.\nQ: 1...2...3!\nHe cowers with his hands over his ears while James looks on. Fred explodes \u2013 of course - his top half scattered around the room.\nQ: Don\u2019t say it!\nBOND: The writing\u2019s on the wall?\nQ: Along with the rest of him.\nBond smirks. Never a dull moment.\nQ: Now, 007 do try and...\nQ is interrupted by a technician being launched across the room by a blast of air.\nNothing interesting to these guys. Bond picks up a sub sandwich and begins to inspect it, looking for knives to shoot from it or something.\nQ: Do try and return some of this equipment in pristine order...\nQ notices what James is doing.\nQ: Don\u2019t touch that!\nJames is scared as Q grabs the sub.\nQ: That\u2019s my lunch!\n60 - Ext. Runway - Day\nA British Airways jet touches down on the runway in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n61 - Ext. Airport Exit - Day\nBond walks from the terminal and spots the guy he\u2019s looking for. Big dude with a stupid fur hat and a trench coat. Name\u2019s Jack Wade, 007\u2019s CIA counterpart. Bond approaches him and ventures at casual conversation, otherwise known as code to establish alliance.\nBOND: In London, April\u2019s a spring month.\nWADE: Aw yeah? And who are you, the weatherman? And fer cryin\u2019 out loud! Another stiff-ass Brit! Yer secret codes and yer passwords. One of these days you guys\u2019re gonna learn to drop it. Come on, my car\u2019s over there.\nBond is a little annoyed. They cross the street to a little blue...um...car - box thing. Bond opens a door.\nBOND: After you.\nWADE: Thank you.\nJames whips out his Walther, jamming it into Wade\u2019s chest.\nBOND: Like you said...Drop it!\nWADE: Alright, in London April\u2019s a spring month, where\u2019s in St. Petersburg we\u2019re freezin\u2019 our butts off. Now is that close enough for government work?!\nBOND: No! Show me the rose.\nWADE: Please, no.\nBond slams the gun harder.\nWADE: Alright! Alright! Alright!\nWade partially drops his pants showing a tattoo of a rose with the word \u2018Muffy\u2019 above it.\nBOND: Muffy?\nWADE: Third wife. Jack Wade. CIA.\nBOND: James Bond. Stiff-ass Brit.\nWADE: That\u2019s a nice move...\nBOND: Nice car.\nWADE: Well, she hasn\u2019t let me down yet. She\u2019s like a little bitch, but she gets ya there. (pause) Hey Bond. Ya do any gardening?\n62 - Ext. Train Station - Day\nNatalya appears getting off a train, and looks behind her back like she\u2019s being followed. She only sees two Russian soldiers.\n63 - Ext. Plaza - Day\nThe little blue box that Wade calls a car is sitting in the middle of a square with smoke coming from the engine (in the trunk, ya know like old VW Beetles). Wade\u2019s trying to fix it. We move in closer...\nWADE: Can ya hand me that wrench, Jimmy?\nJames picks up a wrench and hands it to Wade.\nBOND: So what do you know about Janus?\nWADE: Zilch. No one\u2019s ever seen him. But the man\u2019s connected up the gazoo. KGB, military. Screwdriver.\nJames picks up a screwdriver from the pile of tools.\nWADE: Rumor has it, he lives on one of those old Soviet missile trains. That armored stuff they used to run around the country so we couldn\u2019t target\u2019em.\nWade stands up.\nWADE: Ya wanna hand me that hammer, Jimbo?\nBond picks up a hammer. Wait... \u201cJimbo\u201d?!\nWADE: No, the bigger one. The sledge.\nBond picks up a sledge hammer.\nWADE: Anyways, to tell the truth, you don\u2019t find this guy, he finds you.\nWade proceeds to hammer the screwdriver gently into the engine.\nWADE: Hell, it\u2019s all Russian Mafia...The best I can do is point you in the direction of his competition.\nWade whacks the engine HARD with the sledge hammer, and roars to life. Bond smirks.\nBOND: Who is the competition?\nWADE: An ex-KGB guy. Tough mother. Got a limp on his right leg, name\u2019s Zukovsky.\nBOND: Valentin Dimitrovich Zukovsky?\nWADE: Yeah! You know him?\nBOND: I gave him the limp.\n64 - Ext. IBM Building - Day\nNatalya walks up to a building with the familiar IBM logo on it. She enters.\n65 - Int. IBM Building - Day\nShe walks inside and locates the manager in a room marked \"No Access\" carrying a CPU. She knocks on a door to get the guy\u2019s attention. He puts the CPU down.\nMANAGER: Yes?\nNATALYA: Are these all you have?\nShe looks around the room at about 10 to 15 computers.\nMANAGER: How many do you want?\nShe reads from a paper...\nNATALYA: Twenty-four for the American school, eleven for the Swedish, IBM Compatible with 500 MHz drives and 34 modems.\nMANAGER: You pay dollars?\nNATALYA: Of course.\nMANAGER: If ma\u2019dam would require a demonstration...\nNATALYA: Ma\u2019dam requires a demonstration modem and a quiet place to test it.\nThe manager shows her into a back room.\n66 - Int. Boris\u2019 computer lab - ?\nIn an unknown location, we see a screen with Boris\u2019 program. \u201cIncoming E-mail\u201d. Boris turns around wearing a sweater with the peace sign on it. Funky. He sees who the mail\u2019s from...\nBORIS: Natalya!\nTypes: \u201cI thought you were dead.\u201d\n67 - Int. IBM back room - Day\nNatalya is seated at a PC. She types, evidently in an e-mail. \u201cOurumov killed everyone, fired \u2018Petya\u2019, took GoldenEye\u201d. The manager bursts in the room, scaring the crap out of Natalya.\nMANAGER: Is everything satisfactory?\nNATALYA: Everything except the interruption.\nHe leaves.\n68 - Int. Boris\u2019 computer lab - ?\nBoris types: \u201cYou aren\u2019t safe. Trust no-one. Meet me at Our Lady of Smolensk in one hour.\u201d\n69 - Int. IBM back room - Day\nNatalya gets the message, smiles.\n70 - Ext. Bridge - Day\nThe little blue box Wade calls a car drives across a bridge.\nWADE (V.O.): Lemme get this straight Jimmy...you shot him in the leg, you stole his car, you took his girl, now you want Valentin Zukovsky to set you up with Janus?\n71 - Ext. Valentin\u2019s club - Day\nThe car pulls up...\nBOND (V.O): Yes.\nWADE (V.O.): Well, what are ya gonna do, appeal to his heart?\nBOND (V.O.): No, his wallet.\nWADE (V.O.): Oh, now that might work...OK, showtime!\nThe car stops and we see Wade and Bond both stuffed inside. They see two Russians by a car.\nWADE: Valentin operates out of Building 23, there. You sure you wanna do this? The last guy who dropped in uninvited went home Air Freight. In very small boxes.\nBOND: Make sure they send me home First Class.\nBond gets out of the car.\n72 - Ext. Church - Day\nNatalya walks up to \u201cOur Lady of Smolnesk\u201d, a church.\n73 - Int. Church - Day\nShe walks inside. Quiet. Very quiet. Extremely Romanesque, like in any other large church Orthodox church. Natalya looks up at a suspended cross. She waits, looks for Boris. She spots a suspicious-looking figure in a black cloak, praying. The heavy doors suddenly close by themselves, almost blowing out some candles. Natalya runs, totally freaked out, back down the aisle. The figure looks at her, it\u2019s just an old woman. Around the corner she runs\ninto Boris, she screams.\nBORIS: Natalya! It\u2019s me! It\u2019s Boris, it\u2019s Boris! Hello! Shhh...\nXenia walks up from behind Natalya...\n74 - Int. Valentin\u2019s club - Day\nValentin, a big guy with a limp, walks across his nightclub, zips up a woman\u2019s dress. He talks to himself.\nVALENTIN: Another morning shot to hell. The free market economy, I swear it will be the end.\nSuddenly a gun in cocked by his head. We see it\u2019s Bond\u2019s Walther.\nVALENTIN: Walther PPK, 7.65 mm, only three men I know use such a gun...I believe I\u2019ve illed two of them...\nWe pan to the right. Yep. Bond.\nBOND: Lucky me.\nAnother gun presses against James\u2019 head.\nVALENTIN: I think not.\nOn a stage, a few girls attempt to sing \u201cStand By Your Man\u201d. Really badly \u2013 with Russian accents, to boot! But a few men in the audience stay interested, mainly because of the skimpy costumes. Bond is being \u2018escorted\u2019 by two henchmen. They throw him on a couch. Valentin sits on a chair in front of him.\nVALENTIN: James Bond. Charming, sophisticated, secret agent. Shaken, but not stirred...\nThe Russians laugh...\nBOND: I see you haven\u2019t lost your delicate sense of humor, Valentin. Or your need for an audience. Who\u2019s strangling the cat?\nI couldn\u2019t have put it better myself. Valentin looks quizzically where Bond is gazing.\nVALENTIN: Strangling a cat?!\nWe see the lead singer practically howling \u2018Stand by your mahn!!\u2019. Valentin whips out a gun and shoots the couch right between James\u2019 legs...\nVALENTIN: It\u2019s Irina. My mistress.\nBond looks like he just swallowed his words.\nBOND: Very talented girl...\nVALENTIN: Irina!! Take a hike!!!\nIrina shuts up right before giving him an \u201cup yours\u201d with her arms.\nVALENTIN: So, Mr. Bond; what is it that brings you to my neighborhood? Still working for MI6, or have you decided to join the 21st century? I hear the new M is a lady...\nBOND: I want you to do me a favor.\nThe big Russian laughs.\nVALENTIN: He wants me to do HIM a favor!! My knee aches every single day, twice as bad when it is cold. Do you have any idea how long the winter lasts in this country? Tell him Dimitri...\nDIMITRI (O.S.): Well, it depends...\nVALENTIN: Silence!!!!\nBOND: For an ex-KGB agent, you surprise me Valentin. Surely someone of your stature must have realized the skill was not to hit your knee, but to...uh...miss the rest of you.\nVALENTIN: So why did you not kill me?\nBOND: Call it professional courtesy.\nVALENTIN: Then I should extend you the same courtesy...\nValentin shoots to Bond\u2019s right leg, miss. Left leg, miss again. Valentin aims in between...\nBOND: Kerov\u2019s Funeral Parlor, 4 o\u2019clock this afternoon!\nHe\u2019s got his attention...\n75 - Int. Valentin\u2019s office - Day\nBond is seated, Valentin\u2019s getting a drink.\nBOND: Two hundred pounds of C4 explosives hidden in a casket. Your man drives the hearse in. The money\u2019s  exchanged. Their man drives the hearse out. Their man will be arrested with the explosives. Your man will make a miraculous escape with the money. Your money.\nValentin sits at his desk.\nVALENTIN: And what do I owe for this accommodation?\nBOND: I want you to set me up. With Janus.\nVALENTIN: And what has he done to deserve you?\nBOND: Stole a helicopter.\nVALENTIN: I have six.\nBOND: Three. None that fly.\nVALENTIN: Who\u2019s counting?\nBOND: These aren\u2019t criminals Valentin, they\u2019re traitors. They used the chopper to steal a nuclear weapon, killed a lot of innocent Russians doing it.\nVALENTIN: What do you expect from a Cossack?\nBOND: Who?\nVALENTIN: This Janus. I\u2019ve never met the man, but I know he\u2019s a Lienz Cossack.\nBOND: Grouped that worked for the Nazis against the Russians, second World War.\nVALENTIN: You know your history, Mr. Bond. At the end of the war, the Lienz Cossacks surrendered to the British in Austria, believing they would join your government and wage war against the Communists. But the British betrayed them. Sent them back to Stalin who promptly had them all shot. Women, children, families.\nBOND: Not exactly our finest hour.\nVALENTIN: Still, ruthless people. They got what they deserved.\nBOND: I want you to set me up with Janus. Tell him I\u2019m asking about the chopper and\nmeet me tonight at the Grand Hotel Europe.\nVALENTIN: Then you and I are even and he owes me one.\nBOND: Precisely.\n76 - Ext. Grand Hotel Europe - Night\nBond\u2019s elegant hotel...\n77 - Int. Pool Area - Night\nA shadow moving through the pool water. James surfaces right in front of the camera, then pushes off the side of the cement pool floating on his back. Nice pool, circular, with huge pillars surrounding it...we see a door open and someone walks in, circling the pool. James is still floating peacefully when he notices someone\u2019s watching him. Wait! Isn\u2019t that...?! He climbs out of the pool. He grabs a towel and dabs his face. Then he grabs his Walther. James pulls the person by the arm, pulling them into a steam room. He aims the gun at...Xenia. Wearing only a loosefitting robe. James is a little interested. His chiseled body is still soaked, hair slicked back...looking sexy...\nXENIA:  You don\u2019t need the gun, Commander.\nBOND: That depends on your definition of safe sex.\nShe comes at him, really close. His only weakness...\nBOND: That\u2019s close enough.\nXENIA:  Not for what I have in mind.\nThey kiss. James tosses the gun on a massage table. She pulls away, with his lower lip clenched in her teeth. Bond flinches and pushes her to the wall. He touches his lip, a little blood, but enough to get him pissed off. He goes for the gun...Xenia kicks him to the ground before he can get it. She jumps on top of him, he rolls on top of her...\nXENIA:  You think you can hurt me?\nJames gets off of her, and goes for the gun again. Xenia pushes him onto the massage table, and jumps on him. Normally, Bond would love this - but she\u2019s crushing his rib cage. He gasps, and tries to pry her legs off his torso. He gets up, with Xenia still hanging on with her legs, and slams her against the wall.\nXENIA:  You think you can break me?\nThey kiss again wildly...She squeezes harder, Bond\u2019s eyes pop open and he runs slamming Xenia into another wall. Now she\u2019s screaming...he sits her on the steam grate. Another guy has heard the screaming and Bond swiftly knocks him out. He flips Xenia over his shoulder, finally off of him. Now he gets the gun and aims it at her.\nBOND: No, no, no. No more foreplay.\nHe cocks the gun.\nBOND: Take me to Janus.\nXENIA:  (Russian) Bastard!!\n78 - Ext. Statue Junk yard - Night\nA gray Mercedes pulls up at a junk yard littered not with garbage, but with hundreds of old stone statues. From before the fall of the Iron Curtain. VERY eerie.\n79 - Int. Mercedes - Night\nXenia\u2019s at the wheel, Bond is in back covered in shadow pointing a gun at Xenia.\nBOND: This is it?\nXENIA:  Yes.\nHe leans forward, puts the gun away.\nBOND: Well, I must say, I\u2019ve had a lovely evening. You?\nXENIA:  Once again, the pleasure was all yours.\nBOND: You\u2019ll understand if I don\u2019t call...\nXENIA:  I won\u2019t loose sleep over it.\nHe suddenly whacks her in the back of the head, knocking her out.\nBOND: Sweet dreams.\n80 - Ext. Junk yard - Night\n007 steps out of the car, and spots the Tiger helicopter. He draws his gun. This place in very freaky, folks. Plus it\u2019s dark, and Bond\u2019s eyes start to play tricks on him. He aims the gun at someone...no. A statue.\nVOICE (O.S.): Hello, James.\nBond whips the gun around at the voice. Sounds familiar...A dark shadow walks out from what\u2019s left of a building. 006 steps into the light. His face is badly scarred on the right side. Bond stands there, frozen in place...\nBOND: (Softly) Alec...?\nALEC: Back from the dead. No longer than just an anonymous star on the memorial wall at MI6.\nBond is still frozen, his blue eyes wide.\nALEC: What\u2019s the matter, James? No glib remark? No pithy comeback?\nBOND: (Softly) Why...?\nAlec laughs.\nALEC: Hilarious question. Particularly from you. Would you ever ask why? Why we toppled all those dictators, undermined all those regimes? Only to come home \u2018Well done! Good job, but sorry ol\u2019 boy! Everything you\u2019ve risked your life and limb for has changed!\u2019\nBOND: It was the job we were chosen for.\nALEC: Of course you\u2019d say that. James Bond, Her Majesty\u2019s loyal terrier. \u2018Defender of the so-called Faith\u2019.\n007\u2019s had enough, he raises his gun.\nALEC: Oh, please James. Put it away. It\u2019s insulting to think I haven\u2019t anticipated your every move.\nBond relaxes his arm.\nBOND: Yes...I trusted you, Alec.\nALEC: Trust. What a quaint idea.\nBOND: How did the MI6 screening miss that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?\nALEC: Once again your faith was misplaced. They knew. We\u2019re both orphans, James. While your parents had the luxury of dying in a climbing accident, mine survived the British betrayal and Stalin\u2019s execution squads. But my father couldn\u2019t let himself or my mother live with the shame of it. MI6 figured I was too young to remember. And one of life\u2019s little ironies, their son goes to work for the government who caused a father to kill himself and his wife.\nBOND: Hence, Janus. Two-faced Roman god come to life\nALEC: It wasn\u2019t God who gave me this face...It was you! Setting the timers to three minutes instead of six.\nBOND: Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?\nALEC: No. You were suppose to die for me. And by the way, I did think of asking you to join my little scheme, but somehow I knew 007\u2019s loyalty was always to the mission, never to his friend. (Pause) Closing time, James. Last call!\nBond goes to raise his gun, but a quick shot is fired. A tranquilizer hits his neck, and Bond collapses. We see a sniper in the background reveal his position. Alec stands over James.\nALEC: For England, James.\n81 - Int. Tiger Cockpit - Night\nJames wakes up and finds himself inside the cockpit of the helicopter. There\u2019s someone behind him...it\u2019s Natalya SCREECHING...\nNATALYA (O.S.): WAKE UP!! MISTER! AHHHH! WAKE UP, PLEASE!!! WAKE UP!!!\nBond is totally awake now. Gee.\nBOND: I\u2019m here, I\u2019M HERE!!\nNATALYA (O.S.): Hurry! Hurry up! Come on! Pull yourself together, or we\u2019re gonna die!\nThere\u2019s a screen in front of him \u201cTime to Launch\u201d. Bond attempts to free himself, but his hands are tied to tightly.\nNATALYA: Do something! You\u2019ve got to get us out of here!!\nBond is still struggling...\nBOND: I\u2019m...a little...tied up! Nevermind...\n\u201cTime to Launch :19\u201d He tries to hit the controls with his head. The rotor is starting to turn now...\u201dLaunch :00\u201d Bond eyes the chopper\u2019s heat-seekers deploy. Oh, crap. Two of them fire and trail back at them. Bond looks for the EJECT button...there it is! He tries to hit it with his head. Once...twice...third time\u2019s a charm! The rotors fly off and the entire cockpit ejects in the nick of time. The helicopter explodes, the parachute discharges, and they land safely on the ground. Bond finally gets the ropes untied, and he hops out of the cockpit.\nBOND: The things we do for frequent-flyer mileage...\nHe opens the canopy for Natalya.\nBOND: Here, let me help you...that\u2019s it...mind your head...\nHe helps her out. She kicks him in the shin. She starts to run away, but 007 grabs arm and tries to calm her down as headlights shine on them. Soldiers pop out of the trucks aiming their weapons. Natalya finally stops struggling.\n82 - Ext. Square - Night/early morning\nJames and Natalya are escorted to a building which could be anything from a jail to a government office.\n83 - Int. Interrogation Room - Early morning\nJames and Natalya walk into a interrogation room handcuffed together. The sun is just starting to come up. Not much in here, just a barren brick room. A guard removes the cuffs and exits, the large metal door slamming behind him. Bond looks to Natalya, who backs away to the wall.\nBOND: Who are you?\nNo answer. He walks toward her.\nBOND: Listen, I\u2019m on your side. I\u2019m here to help.\nNATALYA: I don\u2019t know anything.\nBOND: I don\u2019t believe you.\nNATALYA: I don\u2019t care what you believe...\nBOND: Look, they might be back for us any minute. You either take your chances with me or your fellow countrymen who killed everyone at Severnaya. Bond is in her face, being a tough guy. Natalya pulls away from him.\nNATALYA: I\u2019ve never been to Severnaya.\nBond grabs her arm and looks at her watch.\nBOND: Your watch has. Frozen by the GoldenEye blast. And I\u2019m willing to bet you\u2019re the one who climbed out the dish to get out.\nNATALYA: Who are you?\nBOND: I work for the British government. The more you tell me, the more I can help you.\nNATALYA: I said I don\u2019t know anything!!\nBOND: Then let\u2019s start with what you do know.\nShe sits on the table in the middle of the room. She might as well tell him.\nNATALYA: My name is Natalya Simonova. I was a systems programmer at the Severnaya facility.\nBOND: Go on...\nNATALYA: Until they killed everyone.\nBOND: Who? Alec Trevelyan?\nNATALYA: No. I don\u2019t know who that is.\nBOND: Who\u2019s the insider, who\u2019s the traitor?\nNATALYA: Boris. Boris Grishenko.\nBOND: KGB or military?\nNATALYA: Computer programmer.\nBOND: There was no one else?\nNATALYA: No. They\u2019re going to kill me, aren\u2019t they?\nBOND: Trust me.\nNATALYA: Trust you. I don\u2019t even know your name.\nThe door clicks open and the Defense Minister enters, wearing a fedora hat.\nMISHKIN: Good morning, Mr. Bond. Sit.\nHe walks around the table and sits down. James and Natalya do too.\nMISHKIN: I\u2019m Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin. By what means shall we execute you Commander Bond?\nBOND: What, no small talk? No...chit-chat? That\u2019s the trouble with the world today; no-one takes the time to do a really sinister interrogation anymore. It\u2019s a lost art.\nMISHKIN: Your sense of humor doesn\u2019t slay me, Commander, I\u2019m sorry. Where is the GoldenEye.\nBOND: I assumed you had it.\nMISHKIN: I have an English spy, a Severnaya programmer, a helicopter stolen...\nBOND: At least that\u2019s what some traitor in your government wanted it to look like...\nMISHKIN: Who was behind your attack on Severnaya...?\nBOND: Who had the authorization codes...?\nMISHKIN: Russia may have...the penalty for terrorists is death...\nBOND: And what\u2019s the penalty for treason...?\nNATALYA: Oh, stop it! Both of you! Stop it. You\u2019re like...boys with toys. [Silence.] It was Ourumov. General Ourumov set off the weapon. I saw him do it.\nBond turns his head slowly toward Natalya. Mishkin is pleased.\nMISHKIN: Are you certain it was Ourumov?\nNATALYA: Yes. He killed everyone and stole the GoldenEye.\nMISHKIN: And why would he do that?\nNATALYA: There is another satellite.\nMISHKIN: Another GoldenEye. Thank you, Miss Simonova. You were saying something about the lost art of interrogation, Mr. Bond?\nOurumov barges in the room, visibly enraged.\nOURUMOV:  Defense Minister! I must protest! This\u2019s my investigation! You\u2019re out of order!\nMISHKIN: (Russian) Idle praddle. (English) From what I\u2019m hearing, it is YOU who is out of order!\nOurumov picks up the PPK...\nOURUMOV:  I\u2019ve seen this gun before...\nMISHKIN: Put it down General! Put it down!\nOURUMOV:  Do you even know who the enemy is? DO YOU!\nMISHKIN: Guards!!\nOurumov quickly shoots a guard as well as Mishkin. Bond hits the deck, pulling Natalya with him. He slides out the clip, takes the bullets, slips the empty clip back into the gun. He thinks aloud...\nOURUMOV:  Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin murdered by British agent James Bond.\nHe tosses the gun to 007.\nOURUMOV:  Who was shot while trying to escape...GUARD!\nBond, who\u2019s still on the ground, pushes a chair underneath the General, knocking him over. Then Bond punches him and runs him into a metal pipe. A soldier comes in the room, Bond beats him up and grabs his weapon, then pulls Natalya out the door with him.\nBOND: Come on!\n84 - Int. Hallway - Morning\nBoth of them run out the door and up some stairs, Bond shooting soldiers as they run, sliding on the floor, the whole bit. To his right, left, more are coming. They flee through another door.\n85 - Int. Archive Hall - Morning\nThe pair run through a room on the second floor. Shelves full of boxes and old paper occupy the room. More soldiers are coming. Bond pushes a bookcase over, creating a domino effect we\u2019ve seen in cartoons.\nOURUMOV:  They\u2019re in the archives!\nThe falling bookcases barricade a door shut, cutting off Ourumov and company.\nOURUMOV:  NO!\nThey take an alternate route. Bond and Natalya look out a window at a lot filled with trucks and...tanks. They run. Soldiers burst through another door. Natalya is hiding behind a shelf when a few books fall over. The General knows their location now...The Russians are on the first floor, and they hear Bond running above them. The soldiers fire,\nBond fires back, running in front of Natalya. Bond and Natalya stop\u2026\nOURUMOV (O.S): Spread out! Cover the other side!\n\u2026 and he removes the belt Q gave him. He smirks.\nBOND: Trust me.\nThey stand up and run, but Natalya crashes through some loose grating right into Ourumov\u2019s arms. Bond fires the belt. He swings across the room, kicks over a soldier and crashes through a window into the back of a truck.\n86 - Ext. Back Lot - Morning\nJames jumps down from the truck and hides beside a tank.\nBond\u2019s P.O.V. - Natalya being carried off by Ourumov. They get in a car.\nOURUMOV:  Go! Now!\nIt drives away but two more truck-fulls of Russian soldiers enter the lot. Bond eyes a tank. Number 343.\n87 - Ext. Streets of St. Petersburg - Morning\nOurumov\u2019s car speeds away, but then a TANK crashes through a solid brick wall. We see Bond poke his head out.\nOURUMOV:  Faster!\nThe tank is close behind the car, cutting turns a little too closely. Ourumov\u2019s car is slowed by traffic.\nOURUMOV:  Damn! Go down the alley!\nThe car peels out through a narrow alley. Tight squeeze...007 notices this too and ducks below. He follows creating a MUCH larger alley. Ourumov takes a swig of his liquor flask. The two jeeps following the tank fly off into the water, exploding.\nOURUMOV:  Use the bumper! That\u2019s what it\u2019s for!\nSo the driver continues, hitting all the bystanders crossing the street. Bond takes a corner, but there are two jeeps in his way. He stops the tank.\nSOLDIER: (Russian) Back up!\nThey do. Bond moves forward. The soldiers fire and 007 ducks below again. A 13-car pile-up clogs the road, but not if you\u2019re in a tank. Bond runs right over it. The tank catches up with the car in a square with a statue in the middle. Both vehicles run over anything in their path: traffic. Bond crashes through a truck with boxes of Perrier on it, and then a statue of a man riding a winged horse. The bronze portion in now riding on top of the tank.\nOURUMOV:  Go left!\nThey do. An archway looks a little low...the statue gets caught in it for a second, hangs there, then drops on two persuing police cars, the statue riding between them. Bond abruptly halts the tank and the cars collide with the backside of the tank. Bond looks back at the damage, coolly straightens his tie and continues. Meanwhile, Ourumov\u2019s car comes screeching to a halt near a black armored train, red star on the side.\nOURUMOV:  Get out!\nHe pulls Natalya out. Xenia jumps down from the train. Ourumov pushes Natalya aboard. Bond is just pulling up, he\u2019s watching now and we can see in his eyes that he\u2019s got an idea... The tank continues. The train lurches forward.\n88 - Int. Train - Morning\nInside the train, Ourumov brings Natalya into a car with elegant furnishings. Alec is eating breakfast with an expensive silver tea set. He dabs his mouth with a napkin. Xenia sits behind him.\nALEC: You brought me the perfect gift, General Ourumov. You\u2019ve made me a very unhappy man.\nOURUMOV:  Mishkin got to him before I could.\nALEC: Bond is alive?\nOurumov takes out his flask again.\nOURUMOV:  He escaped.\nALEC: Good for Bond. Bad for you.\nHe eyes Natalya and attempts to be a gentleman.\nALEC: Take a seat, my dear.\nShe does. He walks behind her and kneels down.\nALEC: You know, James and I shared everything. Absolutely everything...\nHe pulls back her hair from her face.\nALEC: To the victor go the spoils.\n89 - Ext. Tracks - Morning\nThe train travels down the tracks and Bond\u2019s tank pulls up in a tunnel.\n90 - Int. Train - Morning\nAlec tries to kiss Natalya, she resists.\nALEC: You\u2019ll like it where we\u2019re going...\n91 - Ext. Tracks - Morning\nBond\u2019s tank is still sitting there. The driver of the train notices the obstruction.\n92 - Int. Train - Morning\nAlec kisses Natalya.\nALEC: You may even learn to like me...\nHe kisses her again, full on the lips this time. She squirms...and slaps him\nNATALYA: (Russian) Bastard!\nAn alarm sounds.\nALEC: (To Ourumov) Stay with her.\nAlec and Xenia run to a monitor showing Bond\u2019s tank parked in the tunnel.\nALEC: Bond. Only Bond.\nXENIA:  He\u2019s going to derail us...\nAlec talks to the conductor with a radio.\nALEC: Full speed!\nConductor: (Russian) What?\nALEC: Full speed!! Ram him!\nXenia\u2019s grinning, the conductor sounds a whistle. Alec and Xenia brace themselves for a collision.\n93 - Ext. Tracks - Morning\nThe train speeds forward toward the tank. Bond fires the main gun, making the train into a speeding fireball. James jumps from the tank crouches in the brush. The train and tank collide, stopping the train in its tracks.\n94 - Int. Train - Morning\nIt looks like an earthquake hit in here. Natalya recovers from the shock and runs for the door. Ourumov grabs her.\nXenia and Alec are still on the floor. Alec comes to and tries to pounce on a gun. A foot pins it to the ground. It\u2019s Bond. Pointing a machine gun at 006. Alec lies on the ground.\nALEC: Why can\u2019t you just be a good boy and die?\nBOND: You first. (To Xenia) You, second. UP!\nBoth stand up.\nALEC: Situation analysis: hopeless. You have no back-up, no escape route. And I have the only bargaining chip.\nBOND: Where is she?\nALEC: Ah, yes. Your fatal weakness. (into a radio) Ourumov, bring her in. (to Bond) Lovely girl. Tastes like...strawberries.\nBOND: I wouldn\u2019t know...\nALEC: I would.\nXenia is licking her leather-clad fingers. Bond hears Ourumov bring Natalya into the room behind him. With a gun pointed to her head I might add.\nALEC: So, we\u2019re back to where we started, James. The friend or the mission? Drop the gun, I let her live.\nBOND: Ourumov, what has this Cossack promised you?\nOurumov is listening...\nBOND: You knew, didn\u2019t you? He\u2019s a Lienz Cossack.\nALEC: It\u2019s in the past...\nBOND: He\u2019ll betray you! Just like everyone else.\nOURUMOV:  Is this true?\nALEC: What\u2019s true is that in 48 hours you and I will have more money than God. And Mr. Bond here will have a small memorial service, with only Moneypenny and a few tearful restitures in attendance. So, what\u2019s the choice, James? Two targets, time enough for only one shot. The girl or the mission?\nBOND: Kill her. She means nothing to me.\nALEC: See you in Hell, James.\nBond makes his move. He spins around and shoots Ourumov, then turns and shoots at Alec, but he got away. Armor clicks into place around the doors and windows. Bond runs to every door, and checks the roof.\nBOND: One-inch armor plating.\nNATALYA: I\u2019m fine, thank you very much.\nShe sits at a computer. Bond is still fiddling with the roof.\nNATALYA: Boris! Yes!\nBond brings his arms down.\nBond:What are you doing?\nNATALYA: Boris is online backing up his files. If I can spike him, I may be able to find out where they\u2019re going.\nBond has NO idea what all that means.\nBOND: Oh.\nNATALYA: Well, don\u2019t just stand there! Get us out of here!\nBOND: Yes, sir.\n95 - Ext. Train - Morning\nThe top of the train retracts to reveal a little Robinson helicopter.\n96 - Int. Train - Morning\nBond is pulling up carpet, trying to find a place to cut through.\n97 - Int. Robinson - Morning\nAlec and Xenia are seated in the chopper.\n98 - Int. Train - Morning\nWe see the screen with Boris\u2019 program. An intercom sounds.\nALEC (V.O.): Good luck with the floor, James. I set the timers for six minutes. The same six minutes you gave me.\n99 - Int. Robinson - Morning\nALEC: It was the least I could do for a friend.\nHe laughs, really sinister folks...\n100 - Int. Train - Morning\nNATALYA: What does that mean?\nBOND: We\u2019ve got three minutes.\nHe takes off his watch.\n101 - Ext. Train - Morning\nThe little chopper flies away.\n102 - Int. Boris\u2019 Unknown Location - Who knows???\nBoris is seated at a computer, twirling a pen around his fingers.\n103 - Int. Train - Morning\nNatalya is sending a SPIKE. \u201cSpike Sent\u201d\n104 - Int. Boris\u2019 Location - ?????\nBoris notices the problem, and he freezes.\n105 - Int. Train - Morning\nBond is burning through the floor with the laser from his watch. Natalya is trying to figure out Boris\u2019 password... \u201cbutt\u2019...no. \u201cArse\u201d...no. \u201cBuns\u201d...no. \u201cRear\u201d...no!\nNATALYA: What else do you call your butt?\nBOND: What?!\nNATALYA: It\u2019s Boris\u2019 password, he plays word games. It\u2019s what I sit on, but I can\u2019t take it with me...\nBOND: Chair.\nNATALYA: Like I said...\nShe tries it...BINGO! \u201cStarting Search\u201d\nBOND (O.S.): Thirty seconds...\nA map pops up. A red line etches cities together.\nNATALYA (O.S.): He\u2019s not in Russia, Germany, Paris, London, Madrid...\nBOND (O.S.): Twenty-five seconds...\nNATALYA (O.S.): New York, Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco...\nBOND: Twenty seconds...!\nBond jumps on the floor, trying to break it.\nNATALYA: Mexico City, Rio, Miami...\n106 - Int. Boris\u2019 Location - ????\nBoris opens a large CPU and rips the circuit boards out, in an attempt to cut the tracer.\n107 - Int. Train - Morning\nBond finally kicked the floor in. He grabs her arm.\nBOND: Come on!\nNATALYA: Wait! He\u2019s in Cuba! Havana, no...\n\u201cDisconnected Search Program\u201d\nBOND: NOW!\nHe pulls her away and they both jump down the hole in the floor.\n108 - Ext. Train - Morning\nThey roll out from under the train and sprint away from the ticking bomb. The train explodes and they fall to the ground. They sit up and watch the burning train. Natalya turns to Bond.\nNATALYA: Do you destroy every vehicle you get into?\nBOND: Standard operating procedure. Boys with toys!\nNATALYA: Hmmm. Maybe I should take care of our transportation for our trip to Cuba.\nBond puts his watch back on. Wait...\nBOND: Our trip...?\nNATALYA: You know how to disarm the weapon?\nBOND: Well, I suppose that depends on what kind of weapon you\u2019re talking about disarming...\nShe smiles and moves in closer...\nNATALYA: Tell me, are there any other standard operating procedures I should be aware of, Commander?\nBOND: Thousands...but I only pay them...\nThey kiss.\nBOND: Lip service.\nThey kiss again. We fade into...\n109 - Ext. Tropical Road - Day\nA beautiful beach. Obviously somewhere in the Carribean. Some island near Cuba. Palm trees and all. Sweet! We pan over to the right, as the blue BMW convertible vvrooms down a dirt road. Bond\u2019s driving...nice sunglasses...Natalya is in a flowered dress. She grins. He grins back.\nNATALYA: My whole life I\u2019ve dreamed of coming to the Carribean. It\u2019s so beautiful. Not another human being in sight.\nAn alarm sounds in the car. A blue screen - a GPS tracking system - pops up. There\u2019s something behind them...Natalya looks up. A Cessna touches down on the road, right in front of the BMW.\nNATALYA: What is it with you and moving vehicles?!!\nThe plane stops, and the BMW screeches to a halt. Wade hops out with a loud Hawaiian shirt on. He\u2019s holding a bag. Bond and Natalya get out of the car.\nWADE: Yo! Jimbo! Brought a little gift from ol\u2019 whats-his-name - T? Z?\nBOND: Q.\nBond looks in the bag.\nBOND: What are you doing here, Wade?\nWade is looking at some of the trees.\nWADE: Banion trees... Why, I\u2019m not here. The CIA has no knowledge, no involvement. Absolutely nothin\u2019 to do with your insertion into Cuba, if ya catch my drift.\nBond slips his shades into his shirt pocket.\nBOND: Yes I do, perfectly.\nWADE: Borrowed the plane from a friend o\u2019 mine in the DEA. Now the Coast Guard and the FAA are both in the loop. You\u2019re cleared on our radar til 06.00 hours.\nWade picks up a piece of paper in the plane.\nWADE: Here\u2019s the latest SAT CAM from Langley. Stay below 600 feet.\nNatalya studies the paper.\nNATALYA: Five hundred feet.\nWADE: Who\u2019s that?\nBOND: Natalya Simonova.\nHe pronounces it wrong.\nNATALYA: Natalya Simonova.\nBOND: Russian Minister of Transportation.\nWade signals with his staw hat for Bond to talk with him \u2018privately\u2019. They move a few inches.\nWADE: Did you check her out?\nBond gets that look in his eye...\nBOND: Head-to-toe.\nWade grins.\nWADE: Right...So yer lookin\u2019 fer a dish the size of a football field, huh? Doesn\u2019t exist. Ya can\u2019t light a cigar in Cuba without us seein\u2019 it!\nNATALYA: I know it\u2019s there. It\u2019s a duplicate of Severnaya, like you secret transmitters in New Zealand.\nWADE: I\u2019ve never been to New Zealand. (to Bond) How\u2019s she know \u2018bout that?!\nBOND: What if I need back-up?\nWADE: Get on the radio. I\u2019ll send in the Marines! Anyway hang a left at the end of the runway, Cuba\u2019s seven miles on yer right.\nWade walks up to the BMW.\nBOND: Yo, Wade.\nBond tosses the keys to Wade. He catches them in his hat.\nBOND: Just one thing...\nWade hops in.\nWADE: Yeah?\nBOND: Don\u2019t push any of the buttons on that car.\nWADE: I\u2019m just gonna go bombin\u2019 around in it!\nBOND: Exactly.\nWADE: Yo James. I got faith. But be careful. He knows yer comin\u2019.\nWade speeds away. Bond and Natalya are left with the plane.\n110 - Ext. Beach - Evening\nJames is sitting on a beach outside their beach-house, deep in thought. Natalya approaches him wearing a white bikini. For once, our 007 doesn\u2019t seem to care... Somethin\u2019s wrong. She sits beside him.\nNATALYA: He was your friend...Trevelyan?\nJames glances at her. No answer.\nNATALYA: And now he\u2019s your enemy and you will kill him. It is that simple.\nBOND: In a word...yes.\nNATALYA: Unless he kills you first.\nBOND: Natalya...\nNATALYA: You think I\u2019m impressed?! All of you! Your guns, your killing, your death...for what?! So you can be a hero? All the heroes I know are dead.\nBOND: Natalya, listen to me...\nNATALYA: How can you act like this? How can you be so cold?\nBOND: It\u2019s what keeps me alive.\nNATALYA: No. It\u2019s what keeps you alone.\nShe starts to get up but he pulls her back down to a kiss. She pulls away, but then kisses him, harder. We fade up on...\n111 - Int. Bedroom - Night\nA fire burns brightly as we fade up. It\u2019s the bedroom of the place they\u2019re staying. We pan to the right and reveal James sleeping peacefully on the bed. Shirt off. Probably more, but we can\u2019t see. A voice...\nNATALYA (O.S.): James?\nHis blue eyes open. Barely above a whisper...\nBOND: Yes?\nNatalya appears from beside him on the bed, wrapped among the sheets. She rolls on top of him.\nNATALYA: On the train, when you told them to kill me - and that I meant nothing to\nyou...did you mean it?\nThey stroke each other\u2019s hair. He smiles...slowly.\nBOND: Yes.\nNatalya looks at him weird...\nBOND: Basic rule. Always call their bluff.\nNatalya takes a pillow and playfully smothers him with it. Bond\u2019s laughing...they grin and kiss again passionately.\n112 - Ext. Cuban sky - Day\nThe little plane soars over blue water and up a cliff with dense vegetation.\n113 - Int. Plane - Day\nJames and Natalya, both dressed in camouflage green, sit in the cockpit. Natalya has a flight map in front of her, and is telling James where to fly.\nNATALYA: Turn ten degrees south, bearing 184.\nBOND: Yes, sir.\nShe laughs. They fly over a crystal blue lake.\nNATALYA: Nothing. There is nothing here.\nBOND: Let\u2019s make another pass.\nThey do. Bond looks out.\nBOND: Maybe Wade was right, maybe there is no dish.\nA ground-to-air missile fires from the water and hits the wing of the Cessna. They\u2019re going down...Bond tries to land in the water, a little off...they\u2019re gonna crash into forest! He pulls both their heads down below the windshield, brace yourselves, folks...make sure your seats and tray-tables are in the upright and locked position...the little plane skids off the surface of the lake and hits the trees, breaking what\u2019s left of the wings off. It finally slows to a halt.\n114 - Ext. Rainforest - Day\nWe see Bond\u2019s arm poke out of the broken windshield. They\u2019re alive, a bit shaken...not stirred -- sorry, I had to! Natalya appears to be knocked out. Bond kicks the door open. He carries her -- well, more accurately, he drags her -- out into the open. Yep, she\u2019s quite unconscious. He drops her to the ground and collapses on top of her.\nBOND: Natalya...?\nNo answer. Duh. He rolls off her, lays on his back and passes out. Time passes, we fade up on Bond\u2019s closed eyes. Then they open, groggily, to see a superimposed Scorpion helicopter. A rope drops from the chopper. Bond attempts to get up, still dazed. We see a person slide down the rope. Bond\u2019s on his feet, still out of it, he stares up at the person. It\u2019s Xenia, who else? Xenia\u2019s P.O.V. - Knocks Bond to the ground.\nShe kicks him again, then pulls him by the collar.\nXENIA:  This time, Mr. Bond, the pleasure will be all mine.\nShe licks his face as she crushes his ribs again. Bond struggles, in pain. Natalya has woken up...She tries to whack Xenia with a big stick, but Xenia\u2019s too quick. She knocks it to the ground, and grabs Natalya by the face.\nXENIA:  Wait for your turn!\nShe bangs Natalya with her forehead, knocking her out. Bond has recovered, and he clips the rope to Xenia\u2019s harness and uses her machine gun to shoot down the chopper pilot.The helicopter goes down, yanking the rope, and Xenia, along with it. She is pulled through the air, screaming, and slammed against a tree. She struggles for a few seconds, but falls silent. The chopper explodes in a bright flash, and our heroes duck to the ground. Bond looks at Xenia, dangling from the tree.\nBOND: She always did enjoy a good squeeze.\n115 - Int. Control deck - Day\nWe cut to inside a large control room, its location still unknown. Trevelyan walks down the stairs, dressed in black. He walks through a glass door to where Boris is sitting at a station of computers.\nALEC: Is the satellite in range?\nBORIS: Six minutes.\nALEC: Prepare the dish.\nBORIS: No it is too early! I am not ready.\nALEC: Do it!!\nAlec walks away. Fine. If he wants it now, he\u2019ll get it now.\n116 - Ext. Rainforest - Day\nBond and Natalya push on through a dense jungle. They see a large satellite dish rising from the water. Like the one in Severnaya.\nBOND: No wonder we couldn\u2019t see it.\nThe dish is still rising.\nBOND: Come on.\nWe cut to a full view of the dish, then we see James and Natalya running toward it.\n117 - Int. Control deck - Day\nAlec opens the protective case and pulls the GoldenEye out. He faces Boris.\nALEC: The world\u2019s greatest cash card.\nTrevelyan hands it to an eager Boris, but doesn\u2019t take his hands off the GoldenEye.\nALEC: It had better not be rejected.\nBoris grabs it and slips it into the slot.\n118 - Ext. Dish - Day\nThe lake water drains now and reveals the \u201cdish\u201d part of the satellite. Bond glances at Natalya.\n119 - Ext. Outer space\nWe see the GoldenEye satellite in orbit.\n120 - Ext. Rainforest - Day\nBond walks closer to the camera, watching...the water keeps draining.\n121 - Ext. Road - Day\nBond and Natalya run along a road, closer to the dish.\n122 - Int. Control deck - Day\nBoris is playing with a pen. He glances at a monitor.\nBORIS: Mischa is online.\nA soldier approaches Alec and hands him a hand-held video screen. Alec looks at it. We see live footage of Bond and Natalya climbing down closer to the dish.\nSOLDIER: Sir!\nALEC: Kill him. The man just won\u2019t take a hint...\nBORIS: Target coordinates...?\nALEC: Target is London.\n123 - Int. Engine room - Day\nGears grind inside an engine room, moving the antenna into position.\n124 - Ext. Dish - Day\nBond and Natalya notice the movement.\nNATALYA: He\u2019s getting ready to signal the satellite.\nBOND: How do you stop it?\nNATALYA: The transmitter above the anten...\nShe is interrupted by shots fired at them. They duck, then dive into the dish. Trevelyan\u2019s soldiers are still firing at them as they slide faster and faster down into the bottom of the dish. We notice there\u2019s a drop in the center where all the water must have drained into. Bond stops himself, bracing his feet at the ledge of the drop, then catches Natalya.\nHe looks into the hole. We see a circular door in the bottom.\n125 - Int. Control deck - Day\nBoris is still seated at the computers.\nBORIS: Antenna in position.\nAlec hands Boris one of the two operational keys. They slip them into their slots.\nALEC: On my count...3...2...1!\nThey turn them at the same time. The same map we saw in Severnaya appears on the wall-size screen. A line moves to intercept London.\n126 - Outer space\nMischa moves into orbit.\n127 - Int. Control deck - Day\nAlec twists a red dial. \u201cWeapon Armed\u201d\nALEC: God save the Queen.\n128 - Int. Facility - Day\nBond and Natalya climb down a ladder below the dish into the facility. Every soldier is on alert. The good guys move around stealthily as the soldiers shout out things in Spanish. Natalya spots a console to the mainframe.\nNATALYA: The mainframe computer.\nBOND: Don\u2019t move!\nHe takes off. James shoots two guards with the Walther, and hides behind a pillar. He notices Natalya climbing down a ladder to the mainframe, despite his orders.  007 fires at the soldiers again. He takes out two detonators and arms them. Soldiers get into better positions, aim at Bond. James realizes he\u2019s outnumbered drastically. He slides the PPK across the floor and shows himself with his arms raised. A soldier shoves him against a wall, pats him down, looking for more weapons. Another soldier grabs him by the collar of his combat vest. We pan to the left showing...the detonators planted on a pouring tank of a pinkish, probably flammable liquid. Meanwhile, the soldiers are bringing Bond down the stairs to the control deck. We see Natalya poke her head out from behind a tank. She runs back into...\n129 - Int. Mainframe - Day\nInside a room that houses a terminal for the mainframe computer, Natalya sits down and begins to type...\n130 - Int. Control deck - Day\nThe soldiers escort Bond to where Alec is standing near Boris. His former friend notices 007.\nALEC: James! What an unpleasant surprise.\nBOND: We aim to please.\nALEC: Where\u2019s the girl?\nNo answer from Bond. Like we expected one... Alec turns to his henchmen.\nALEC: Find her!!\nA few soldiers hurry to find her. On the table are the things that were found in Bond\u2019s pockets; the Walther, a pen (Q\u2019s pen...), and Bond\u2019s passport. Alec fingers through them. He picks up the pen.\nALEC: So how is ol\u2019 Q? Up to his usual tricks? The watch.\nBond sheds his watch. Alec compares it to his own. Slightly different.\nALEC: Ah. New model. Still press here, do I?\nHe presses a button, we cut to see the detonators disarm. The pink liquid is really starting to flood now...\n131 - Int. Mainframe - Day\nNatalya is still typing at the computer terminal.\n132 - Int. Control deck - Day\nWe see a screen. Looks similar to PC Banking. LOADS of cash. Bond knows what\u2019s going on...\nBOND: Interesting set-up, Alec. You break into the Bank of England via computer and transfer the money electronically. Just seconds before you set off the GoldenEye, which erases any record of the transactions. Ingenious.\nALEC: Thank you, James.\nBOND: But it still boils down to petty theft. In the end you\u2019re just a bank robber. Nothing more than a common thief.\nWell, that pisses Alec off. He stands up, very annoyed. Bond just has a special way of getting people mad at him...\n133 - Int. Mainframe - Day\nThe soldiers have located Natalya in the mainframe. She\u2019s almost done... They grab her, but she manages to click \u2018ENTER\u2019. \u201cEncryption in Progress\u201d. Ouch.\n134 - Int. Control deck - Day\nALEC: You always did have a small mind, James. It\u2019s not just erasing bank records, it\u2019s everything on every computer in Greater London. Tax records. Stock market. Credit ratings. Land registries. Criminal records. In sixteen minutes and 43...42 seconds the United Kingdom will re-enter the Stone Age.\nAs he speaks, he circles Bond.\nBOND: A world-wide financial meltdown. And all so mad little Alec can settle a score with the world, 50 years old.\nALEC: Oh, please James. Spare me the Froud. I might as well ask for all those vodka martinis that\u2019ll silence the screams of all the men you\u2019ve killed.\nNatalya is brought into the room now. Alec glances at her.\nALEC: Or if you\u2019ll find forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women. For all the dead ones you\u2019ve failed to protect. England is about to learn the cost of betrayal. Inflation adjusted from 1945.\nHe turns to Natalya.\nALEC: Welcome to the party, my dear.\nBoris finally looks up to see who has just \u2018joined the party\u2019.\nBORIS: Natalya!!\nNatalya lunges at him and punches him in the face, he falls to the ground, cowering under the desk as Natalya continues to beat him up. Soldiers finally pull her away. Alec smirks. Boris puts his glasses back on, and picks up the grenade pen. He\u2019s still on the floor, twirling it pen nervously. He gets up, visibly mad, and Boris faces Natalya.\nBORIS: Don\u2019t ever do that again!!\nNATALYA: This is not one of your games, Boris. Real people will die! You pathetic little worm.\nBoris goes to hit her, but Alec grabs his arm.\nALEC: She was in the mainframe! Check the computer!\nBoris yanks his arm free from Alec\u2019s grasp.\nBORIS: She\u2019s a moron. A second level programmer. She works on the guidance systems.\nNatalya looks as if she\u2019d spit in Boris\u2019 face.\nBORIS: She doesn\u2019t even have access to the firing codes.\nHe spoke too soon. An alarm sounds. Boris runs to a computer. Natalya smirks.\nBORIS: Retro-Rockets firing!\n135 - Space\nRockets fire from the satellite, moving it into the atmosphere.\n136 - Int. Control deck - Day\nBoris types away, twirling the pen with his right hand, clicking it a few times here and there. Bond watches the pen very attentively.\nALEC: What the hell\u2019s happening?!\nBORIS: We\u2019ll have re-entry in...12 minutes!\n\u201cMission Aborted\u201d\nNATALYA: It\u2019ll burn up somewhere over the Atlantic.\nALEC: Deal with it!\nBORIS: She changed the access codes!\nALEC: Then she can fix it...!!\nAlec takes out a pistol and shoves it in Bond\u2019s jaw.\nNATALYA: Go ahead, shoot him. He means nothing to me.\nBond rolls his blue eyes.\nBORIS: I can do it! I can break her codes!\nALEC: Then get on with it!!\nBoris types, twirls the pen. Clicks it two times...looking for three times... Bond watches...Boris drops the pen...Alec is fed up...he points the gun at Natalya.\nALEC: Tell him! Now!\nBoris stands up enraged. We hear the pen click three times. Bingo. Four seconds...\nBORIS: Give me the codes, Natalya! Give them to me!!\nBond knocks the pen from Boris, Bond and Natalya duck. The pen lands in the leaking pink liquid. KA-BOOM!! Huge explosion. Bond and Natalya break for the elevator.\n137 - Int. Elevator - Day\nBOND: Can Boris break your codes?\nNATALYA: Possibly.\nBOND: Possibly?! We have to destroy the transmitter.\nNATALYA: By the way, I\u2019m fine, thank you very much.\n138 - Int. Control deck - Day\nThat pink stuff was flammable. People are on fire, equipment is exploding.\n139 - Ext. Elevator - Day\nThe elevator stops at a tower near the antenna. A guard watches the doors open...revealing Natalya laying on the floor, her back to us. Where\u2019s Bond? The guard approaches her and...Bond drops down from the ceiling of the elevator. He slams the guard into the metal walls. Bond hands Natalya the guard\u2019s pistol.\nBOND: Do you know how to use one of these?\nNatalya slides the mag out, replaces the mag, cocks it. A real pro, folks!\nNATALYA: Yes.\nBOND: Good. Stand aside.\nBond runs across a metal bridge leading to the antenna.\n141 - Int. Control deck - Day\nWhoever\u2019s not dead is controlling the fire with extinguishers now. Alec walks up to Boris.\nALEC: How long?\nBORIS: Two minutes...one minute!\nAlec yells to some soldiers.\nALEC: Guard!\nBORIS: I\u2019m fixing it!\nA soldier steps to Alec\u2019s side.\nALEC: If he moves, kill him.\nThe soldier points a pistol at Boris\u2019 head.\n142 - Ext. Dish - Day\nNatalya spots a helicopter...\n143 - Ext. Antenna - Day\nAlec runs to a cable car thing leading to the antenna.\n144 - Int. Control deck - Day\nBoris wipes the sweat from his glasses, typing in concentration.\n145 - Space\nThe satellite begins to enter the atmosphere, turning red-hot with friction.\n146 - Ext. Bridge - Day\nBond sprints up the narrow bridge, Alec is close behind him on the cable car. Alec fires an assault rifle at 007. Bond hits the deck, fires his own automatic. Alec runs out of ammo, so does Bond. Alec re-loads, Bond ditches the gun and runs up the bridge.\n147 - Int. Control deck - Day\nBoris is still typing...\n148 - Ext. Bridge - Day\nAlec finally takes a handgun and fires at the running 007, but misses him. Alec gets off the car and runs after Bond. He shoots again, Bond flies forward doing a mid-air somersault down an incline and continues. Alec re-loads.\n149 - Int. Engine room - Day\nBond hops down into the engine room for the transmitter.\n150 - Int. Control deck - Day\n\u201cSend Command\u201d. Boris cracked the code.\nBORIS: YES! I am invincible!!\nHe types away.\n151 - Int. Engine room - Day\nThe gears start to move again. Alec finds Bond. They fight, evenly matched. Bond throws 006 down the stairs and shoots a pistol at him. Just misses. But he has an idea of how to stop the antenna; the old fashioned way! Bond grabs a metal pole off the wall and shoves it in the gear belt. He runs down the stairs after Alec. We see the pole do its work. It\u2019s now stuck between two gears.\n152 - Int. Control deck - Day\n\u201cAntenna Malfunction\u201d. Boris squeaks.\n153 - Ext. Dish - Day\nThe antenna screeches to a halt. Bond notices some blood on a railing. Still fresh. He hears a clang of metal-on-metal. Aims at the sound. Nothing. He jumps down into...\n154 - Int. Another room - Day\nThis room looks like it houses the electricity. Bond points the gun around, looking for Alec. Behind him Alec swings down through the door and kicks 007 in the face. They fight again, 006 appears to be winning. Both seem to know the other one\u2019s next move. Both drop their guns, hand-to-hand now. Slamming each other against walls, punch, kick. James starts to get ahead of things, and blocks Alec\u2019s hits. He slams him into a wall, Bond goes for a gun...Alec kicks it away, it fires at nothing. They push each other over tables, block each other\u2019s hits. Whoa, both really know how their opponent fights. Alec gets the chance to grab a gun. He aims it at Bond who\u2019s clings to a ladder, panting. ALEC: You know, James. I was always better.\nJames kicks a lever just before Alec fires. The ladder he\u2019s hanging on to drops down into the sun, very high above the dish. Bond hangs on for dear life...groaning as the ladder jerks to a stop.\n155 - Ext. Rainforest - Day\nNatalya sees Bond on the ladder in obvious trouble.\n156 - Ext. Ladder - Day\nAlec has run out of bullets. He takes out a radio, calls for the helicopter.\nALEC: Alpha one to Gunship!\n157 - Ext. Rainforest - Day\nThe helicopter pilot gets in the chopper.\nAlec (V.O.): Alpha one to Gunship!!\n158 - Ext. Ladder - Day\nBond starts to climb up the ladder, Alec starts to climb down.\n159 - Int. Engine room - Day\nThe gears and things are catching on fire...\n160 - Ext. Ladder - Day\nAlec decides to slide down the ladder, definitely quicker. He hits Bond with his feet, who slips but just grabs on to the last rung. By one arm.\n161 - Ext. Rainforest - Day\nThe chopper takes off.\n162 - Ext. Ladder - Day\nBond looks down. Whoa...WAY too far to jump. And live. No way! Alec, the epitamy of evil, places his boot on Bond\u2019s knuckles. And stomps on it. James has no choice but to let go...and lands on part of the antenna. Only about six feet in diameter. Held up by wires. He can barely pull himself up.\n168 - Space\nThe satellite\u2019s burning up now, in re-entry.\n169 - Int. Control deck - Day\nBoris is frantically shaking the monitor.\nBORIS: SPEAK TO ME!!\n170 - Ext. Ladder - Day\nAlec jumps down to where Bond is and grabs him by the throat, holding him over the side. The helicopter flies into view. Alec looks at it for a spit second...\n171 - Int. Helicopter cockpit - Day\nNatalya appears in the chopper and presses a gun in the pilot\u2019s temple.\n172 - Ext. Ladder - Day\nBond uses this window of opportunity. He kicks 006 off of him and flips him over the side. At the last second he grabs Alec\u2019s foot. Do it in style, James...\nALEC: For England, James?\nBond\u2019s icy eyes are that of a ruthless killer, now.\nBOND: No. For me.\nAnd with that he drops his ex-friend/neo-enemy. Alec hits the bottom of the disk with a sickening THUD.\n173 - Int. Control deck - Day\nBoris is SCREAMING at the top of his lungs, horror movie style.\n174 - Space\nThe satellite explodes in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n175 - Ext. Dish - Day\nAlec moves his head a little. Natalya forces the helicopter pilot to fly closer to 007.\n176 - Int. Engine room - Day\n...on fire.\n177 - Ext. Ladder - Day\nBond leaps and grabs hold of the chopper\u2019s runners. They fly clear of the whole facility, the antenna\u2019s gonna blow any minute...KA-BOOM! As the whole damn thing blows up and falls right on top of screaming Alec.\n178 - Int. Control deck - Day\nBoris pokes his head out of the rubble. In pieces, but he\u2019s still alive. He jumps up triumphantly.\nBORIS: I am invincible!!!\nSpoke too soon, pal. Just as he says that the liquid nitrogen tanks explode, freezing him into place.\n179 - Ext. Field - Day\nThe chopper lets Bond fall to the ground in a clearing. Natalya jumps out, and it flies away. She drops on top of him. He flinches in pain. She\u2019s worried, and stokes his black hair from his forehead.\nNATALYA: James! James! Are you all right?!\nBond recovers. Flashes a grin. Likes the position she put him in...\nBOND: Yes, I\u2019m fine. Thank you.\nThey kiss, happy to be alive. They roll over so Bond\u2019s on top. Natalya grins.\nNATALYA: Suppose someone is watching....\nHe continues to kiss her. They\u2019re in the middle of nowhere, for god\u2019s sake.\nBOND: There\u2019s no one in twenty-five miles, believe me.\nThey kiss again. We hear a familiar voice...\nWADE (O.S.): Yo! Jimbo!!\nThere he goes with the \u2018Jimbo\u2019 again...James is really startled, he flips suddenly to his knees as soon as he hears that Southern accent. God, it\u2019s Wade. In camo.\nBOND: Is this supposed to be your idea of...um...coming through in a clinch?!\nWADE: It\u2019s the back-up plan. Hey, I\u2019d said I\u2019d be here, huh? Yo! Marines!\nWade gives the USMC sign to reveal your position. About thirty-five Marines appear from nowhere, rising from the grass. Helicopters land around. What\u2019s that...Bond\u2019s blushing a little!\nWADE: Maybe you two would like to finish de-briefing each other at Guantanamo?\nBond looks at Natalya.\nBOND: You ready?\nNATALYA: I\u2019m not going on that helicopter with you...\nBond flashes her a quizzical look.\nBOND: Hmmm?\nNATALYA: No plane! No train! Nothing that moves!\nHe picks her up. She\u2019s still giggling. He gives us that grin again.\nBOND: Darling, what could possibly go wrong, eh?\nThe helicopters load up and fly out.

creator of all things in this world, all things possible and blessed to be here tonight.  As I stand here in the midst of the NFL's 95th season, I'd be remiss not to talk about these guys to the right and these guys to the left of me.  I pay homage to you guys because you represent what this game is about, the excellence on the field and off the field.  Your sacrifices have laid the foundation that we call football today.  I applaud you guys.  I consider you brothers for life.\n\nYou have opened so many doors for me.  You're an inspiration to many all over the country, all over the world.  Now, I know you know what I'm going to say next, \"Where would you rather be than right here, right now?\"\n\nAllentown, Pennsylvania, stand up.  I know you're here.  Kutztown, Pennsylvania.  Buffalo, New York, I know you're here.  Canton, Ohio.  These are blue collared towns that dot the road map of an amazing journey.  They're connected by blood, sweat, tears and cheers of a football life I proudly led the last four decades.  It's a life defined by many things, but none more important than hard work.  When you grow up in Allentown, PA, you learn the meaning of that pretty fast, especially in the household of Joyce and Calvin Reid.  My brothers Tyrone and Dion, and my beautiful sister, Teshia, we're bonded by the values we were taught at home, and that we carry with us today.  My father, Calvin, was a 5'8\" fireplug of a man who worked construction and concrete.  I can remember the days before I went to school, I'd look at his hands and they were so clean when he left.  But when he came home, I remember how dirty those hands were.  You could strike a match in the middle of his hand.  That's how dirty they were.  Just as the forms he carried every day, do as I say, not always as I do.  If you put in a hundred percent, you're guaranteed to get a hundred percent out, and patience is a virtue, and believe me, I waited nine long years for this patience.  That's what Calvin would always tell us.  That's what he'd tell us four kids in the house.  He had a lot of sayings.  I can't say all of them because we'd be here all night.\n\nAs I stand here today experiencing one of the best things of my life on football's biggest stage, all I can say is, Dad, you were right.  You definitely were right.  I love and miss you so much.  I talk to you a lot.  I want to thank you for your wisdom.  Life's lessons are so tough, but you taught me what the right path was about.\n\nOn hot summer days when I was younger, when all the kids were swimming in the swimming pool, having fun, in the community pool my dad would have me and my brothers out there running laps, 95\u00b0 outside.  Do we want to be in the pool?  Oh, you darn right, we did.  We sure did.  How long did we run?  Until he said stop.\n\nOne time this woman asked my mom, she said, Calvin, what are you doing to them kids?  My mom replied, Calvin's getting those kids ready.  He's getting those kids ready for life.  Thank you, Daddy.  You're the best.\nNow don't get me wrong now.  My mom was a nose to the grindstone kind of woman too.  She worked 12 hours a day when I was little in the garment factory.  She did everything she could to keep the family together.  There were a lot of times I walked past that factory and I'd see her at that sewing machine, and I'd say, \u201cYou know what, Mom?  One day that sewing stuff is going to be over with.  You're never going to sew ever again.\u201d  Mom, I love you so much.  You're my inspiration of my heart.  Thank you for your unconditional love.  Tonight you're in the Hall of Fame too.\n\nI didn't grow up in the easiest of childhoods.  For all the great things that my dad did, he had his faults just like we all do.  And my dad's biggest fault, he was an alcoholic.  In his life growing up there were many challenges that anybody would have trouble conquering.  I saw things growing up no child should see.  So sports became my safe haven, my shield, my guard.\n\nWhen I was at the Boys & Girls Club in Allentown, PA, which I continue to support today with my foundation, I felt that shield around me every single day.  Invincible I felt, indestructible, you know it, fearful of nothing.  Me and my brothers, we all wanted to take anybody on.  Whoever wanted to play.  We got you.  You want to play us?  Let's go.  That's how we worked.  Any sport, basketball, football, baseball, didn't matter.  They were important in my life, not only for my development as a football player, but as a person, and for that I'm very grateful to them.\n\nThe same could be said for my Pop Warner coaches.  Roy Sekoch and Gene Legath.  They saw this little skinny kid with a big afro, and they believed in me.  Thank you for all your unconditional love also.\n\nMy brother, Ty, was a star wide receiver at Dieruff High School.  I wanted to be just like you, Ty.  Wanted to be just like you.  That led me to becoming an option quarterback on the JV team at Dieruff High School.  That's where I learned my running skills because I had to run away from all these big guys.  Back then they used to call me a deer, and as you know deer spelled backwards is Reed.  But sometimes, like any deer, you get caught in them headlights and you get hit, and I got hit pretty hard.\n\nMy mom sometimes would see me laying on the ground, didn't think I'd get up.  She'd look at my dad and say I wonder if he's going to get up.  And of course my dad as raw as he is, he said if he gets up, he's all right.  My dad was just raw that way.  That's how he was.  I always did manage to get up though.\n\nI owe so much to my Dieruff coaches in high school who helped shape me as a player.  Bruce Trotter, Larry Little, Ted Phillips, Bill Wood, and Ted Steiner.  I love you guys all.  Thank you very much.\n\nAfter Dieruff High School, I enrolled in small, tiny Kutztown University.  Nobody knows where that is on the map.  But they know now.  There was a coach named Geno Calcagni that came to me as we were starting two a days and asked me to switch to wide receiver.  Yes, it was.  Ain't no doubt about that.\n\nHe said we need you man, at wide receiver.  We have a quarterback that's an All American.  That was Greg Gristick.\n\nI want to thank Gary Klein too.  He taught me everything.  He was my quarterback in college too.  I said, Coach, you know what?  Wherever you need me to play, I've got your back.\n\nAs a player in 1981, my freshman year, the first NFL scout came up to me from the Seattle Seahawks, Walt.  He said to me we're here watching another player because we're looking at him.  He's a defensive back.  We think we might draft him or be a free agent, but we're watching you.  The next three years we're going to watch you and see what you do.\n\nWas I scared?  Oh, yeah, I was scared a little bit.  But I said, okay, I hope you do watch me, because I'm going to be on an NFL roster the following year.\n\nAs my skills improved, as I got older with the help of coaching from Al Leonzi and Geno, and head coach George Baldwin, more scouts started coming to see me, working me out.  It was almost every week after a while.  But the biggest thing they wanted to know was, can I, from a Division II school make the transition to the big time?\nMy coach said, you know what?  Just give him the opportunity.  That's all we wanted in life was an opportunity.\n\nThen one of the teams that came at me late was the Buffalo Bills.  I had no idea where Buffalo was.  They said, \u201cNew York.\u201d  I said, \u201cNew York City?\u201d  They said, no.  They said, \u201cWestern, New York.\u201d  I said, okay.  That was wild.  On that first trip in mini-camp I was on a plane, that's when I met Bruce Smith, the top overall pick at Virginia Tech.  Bruce was standing there on a plane, all 6'4\", 300 pounds of him.  He had the intimidation factor with his sunglasses on.  What an intimidating presence he was.\n\nI introduced myself to him.  I said, hey, \u201cI'm Andre Reed.\u201d  I'm a fourth round draft choice.  He said, yeah, I know who you are.  I said to him, I said, after we land, where we going to go?  I said are we going to the hotel, you know, because we have to go to the hotel.  He said no, we're not going to the hotel.  I said where we going?  He said don't worry about it.  You're coming with me.  It was that day that the Big Tree became etched in my life.\n\nIf you guys don't know what the Big Tree is, you need to go.  Bruce, you know what, man?  When you were here in 2009 I was sitting right here in the audience as you and Ralph Wilson were getting elected.  And you mentioned to me that day that my day was near to joining the Hall of Fame here.  I believed you, and now it's a reality.  I love you as a teammate.  I love you as a friend.  And most of all, I love you as a family member.\n\nIt was also at the Big Tree where I met Darryl Talley.  Darryl was drafted in 1983 out of West Virginia.  I remember one thing he told me as a rookie.  He said, \u201cYou know what?  You don't even know how excited I am about this year's team because I feel right now we have the right players coming in at the right time to put us on the winning path.\u201d  Darryl, what can I say about you, man?  You were the emotional glue to this team, the heart and soul of us.  You kept us all in check, man.  I don't know how you did it, but you kept us all in check, man.  You said, \u201cYou open these doors here in Buffalo, you better check your ego at the door.\u201d  I believed you, man.  Thank you.  I love you.\n\nI also had a great example to follow as a rookie in Jerry Butler.  When I first came into the organization, the coaches said, hey, if you want to be good, watch number 80, he'll teach you how to be a professional on and off the field.  I remember Jerry saying to me, if you play this game the right way, you can play it a long time.  Thank you, Jerry.\n\nI also learned lessons from watching some great receivers that came before me such as fellow Hall of Famer James Lofton.\n\nJames is more than a teammate to me.  I can always confide in him and talk to him about anything.  Growing up as a Steeler fan, I admired players like Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, my idols, Lynn Swann and John Stallworth.  They're up here for a reason.\n\nAnother example of greatness is a guy that went into the Hall of Fame last year that I admire tremendously, and that is Cris Carter.  Michael Irvin, I respect you so much.  You told me about the wait.  You said be patient, and I believed you, man.  I love you.\n\nWhat can I say about this next dude?  Squatty, Thurman Thomas.  From the first day, from the first day you sat at One Bills Drive, I instantly knew how much passion you had for the game of football.  You displayed leadership beyond leadership, tenacity beyond tenacity, and it would never quit at any cost regardless the situation.  Did you speak your mind?  Yeah, you did.  Sometimes when he shouldn't have.\n\nBut I always knew one thing about Thurman, he believed in what he said, and he made you listen whether it be good or bad.  He made me a better player, and definitely made us a better damn team.  You held us accountable, man, for everything we did.  And one thing that I realized about you is family.  Family is important to you.  I've known your kids since they were babies.  You and Patti have done such a great job with them, I consider you a friend for life.  I love you all.\n\nMy career didn't take off until something called the K Gun came out of nowhere. Ask Dan Marino about it.\n\nAn offensive guru named Ted Marchibroda was the guru of this offense, and he knew enough to give the reigns to No. 12. Allowing him to get back to them USFL days where he used to throw for 9 million yards.  I was known for my toughness, I was known for my toughness going across the middle, making that catch, breaking tackles.\nBut the toughest individual I've ever met in my life is Jim Kelly, No. 12.  How do I find the words, man, to say anything about you?  You're the reason why I'm standing here today.  Your belief in me that I could get the job done at any time will resonate with me the rest of my life.  Every time I looked into your eyes in the huddle I knew we could get it done.  I knew we had a chance to win.  Leadership beyond reasonable doubt.  Those around you gravitated to your leadership and what you said.  You taught us not to quit.\n\nWe always joked about what I would say every time I left the huddle whether it was a run or a pass play.  \"Right here, Bro'.\"  I said that every time.  I didn't care if it was a run or a pass.  I was open.\n\nBut we laugh about it now because I wanted the ball.  That was my passion.  I wanted the ball every single time.  I wanted you to be proud of me and know that you could count on me at any time.  You know our old saying, Bro', 12 plus 83 always equals 6.\n\nJim, you have endured a lot in your life, the loss of a son, and most recently your battle with cancer.  You're an inspiration to all those you touch.  I'm honored to call you my teammate, my friend, and my family member, and now a fellow Hall of Famer.  I love you, man.\n\nThere wasn't a better teacher than our head coach Marv Levy.  He was a definition of, speak softly, but carry a big stick.  He became our father figure, very much of a father figure, and he became even more of a father figure to me when I lost mine.  In 1996, when I lost my father, he told me just take as much time as you need.  Marv, I'll always remember those words, your compassion you gave me when I needed it the most.  You had to deal with so many egos, I don't know how in the heck you did it.  Those big words you used, yeah, we needed dictionaries.  We actually needed a thesaurus, too.\n\nBut one thing we admired about you as a coach was that word respect.  We respected the heck out of you.  When you respect your coach, you'll do anything to win for him.  I love you, Marv.\n\nI want to thank all my other coaches, my receiver coaches, Kay Stephenson, Hank Bullough, Wade Phillips, Elijah Pitts, these were my other coaches.  And my receiver coaches, yes.  Joe Daniels, Bob Leahy, Ted Tollner, Nick Nicolau, and fellow Hall of Famer, Charlie Joiner over here.\n\nSix months ago the Bills lost their patriarch, Ralph Wilson, Jr., to me the greatest owner in sports history.  He lives on here as a member of the Hall.  I want to thank him for giving a small town kid the opportunity.  He's part of one of the biggest legacies in NFL history, and the building behind us bears his name.\n\nYou gave me a chance to live out a dream, Ralph, that very few people attain.  I can't thank you enough for that.  And Mary, I can see how much passion you have for the game.  The same passion that Ralph had.  I've come to know you as a friend and I respect you and love you very much.  Oh, yeah, and the Bills will stay in Buffalo too (Cheering).\n\nI want to thank, also, the chief architect of our run to four straight Super Bowls, Bill Polian.  Bill, I'm going to reiterate what Bruce Smith said to me five years ago.  Very soon you will be up here on this podium as one of the greatest GMs of all time.\n\nI also want to thank the late John Butler, whose strong handshake was just so strong.  He had so much confidence in us.  And Bill Munson who I've known for years with the Buffalo Bills organization.  Bill would always ask me if I was in shape every year coming to camp.  I always would answer, do I look like I'm in shape?  Bill, I finally figured out why you always asked me that, because you always knew I would be in shape.\n\nI also want to thank our trainers, Dave and Bud, our equipment staff, Hojo, Woody, everyone else there who kept me healthy and ready to go every single season.\n\nI want to thank all the members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame committee, especially Mark Gaughan whose due diligence for nine years got me here finally.\n\nI want to thank Vic Carucci, thank you for your support and especially your friendship, and Jimmy Goldsmith and Steve Foster.  I appreciate everything you guys have done and continue to do for me.\n\nFinally, I want to talk about my own family.  Starting with the first woman I ever loved in my life, who I ever fell in love with first.  Cindy, we've been through a lot.  It's tough being a football wife.  You've had to deal with a lot of ego, a lot of push and pull.  But through the whole thing, through the good and the bad, you were the rock of that family, and you continue to be the rock today.  You gave us two great kids, and you were always there to hear my voice when it was needed.  Today, you're in the Hall of Fame too.\n\nMy daughter, Auburn, as you try to find your way and peace in life within yourself, I want you to know how important you are to me.  Life is full of ups and downs, peaks and valleys, but if you continue to live out your life, forget the past and go forward, there is definitely going to be a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow.  We're all in this together, babe.  We love you, and we're proud of you.\n\nMy son, Andre, so compassionate, so respectful.  I think he learned that from his mom, not me.  I've watch you grow into a tremendous young man.  Over the past four or five years you've shown me a lot about your character.  Whatever you do in life, if you continue to work hard, it's attainable, definitely.  I'm proud of you, bro'.  I love you.\n\nAs I look back on my career, again, I see a small town kid with a dream of someday being great, making a difference in his community, and most of all, making his parents the proudest people on the planet.\n\nWell, I'm here to say tonight I've done all three of those things, no more routes to run, no more passes to catch, no more DBs to beat.  The journey is complete.\n\nDad, I can still feel that hand on my shoulder.  Thank you, Allentown.  Thank you Kutztown.  Thank you Canton.  And most of all, thank you Buffalo.  I love you.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/433302", "artist_names": "Marvin Gaye", "full_title": "Try It Baby by\u00a0Marvin\u00a0Gaye",

I'll throw dirt on your rotten corpse\nThink you fire till you get your body torched like Johnny Storm\nMake 'em go solar, fuck the laws that crooked cops enforce\nI'll be behind bars when this blow/Blow over like Boston George\nWhat you want drama for?\nLike you never lost before\nThrow shots I throw 'em straight back - I been working on my posture more\nThis year, been on a run - Escobar in the Narco war\nThat's why they got me flaming money like Pablo tryna keep his daughter warm\nI'm hot - dodge the warpath\nForecast? Lightening clouds ahead\nSpray slugs 'til it rains blood, turn the sky brownish red\nNo sunny skies or butterflies as you climbing out of bed\nWake up to birds chirping - it's the concussion as they fly around his head\nPermanent damage\nIt's a wrap for Blood: tourniquet bandage\nHears my name, and breaks out like allergic reactions\nThis is terminal cancer\nSee he knew he was dead when I hit the terminal, panicked\nAnd tried to jet soon as he heard that I landed\nI let 'em carry-on, that's personal baggage\nThen take flight (*chh*) \"Here's a word from your captain.\"\nYou ain't a G, that's plain to see/plane to sea like an emergency landing\nYou listen to him? You think he tucking the heater savage\nRunning the streets with ratchets\nOr buck when the thing is brandished\nYou meet him? Ha, he's comfortable being average\nHumble with decent manners\nReluctant and sheepish as a puppy who needs his master\nBut hold up - I only see a couple people reacting\nI don't think that they understand it\nI mean J ain't what he sounds like - fuck am I speaking Spanish?!\nMijo, it's either you a lick or you hitting licks\nYou know the hustle if you are\nTalking birds'll get 'em clipped, pigeon shit - get to dumping on his car\nWith the shits, swisher lit\nGet him gutted like cigars\nTemple split, that's where I'll stick the pick like strumming a guitar\nEverything core to my aura is more rare\nI'm every ignored prayer in the Lord's ear\nMy worn souls disturb the grave of his corpse there\nReceiving life through death and oxymoron like warfare/war fair\nWar, fair - don't think our wordplay's comparable\nI'll make your birthplace your burial\nBut to kill you's merciful\nOnce stripped of purpose, you'll know living's a worst-case scenario\nSuicide, written note, then his soul exit\nCut 'em slack, give 'em rope, watch 'em stick his own neck in\nBullet or a stab wound tattoo? Let him pick his own weapon\nThen chopper or the blade: that's my stick-and-poke method!\nCheck it, they doubted me on this stage - ain't shit to me a different day\nLast time I left New York with a Championship ring and 50K\nAt home in Cali, but came to NYC to hit a J\nGuess all it took was an altered state to be seen in a different way\n[Round 1: JC]\nEvery letter\nIllmaculate! Illmaculate, Illmaculate, Illmac, you late\nOverdue match-up between you and I\nI know, and I've killed to put things into perspective, I'm GOAT\nAnd I've been that since a zygote\nI'm here to prove somethin' and I have\nThis is just extracurricular, the sideshow\nRatchet on my side and all my guys know\nBut they don't say a word...and that's guy code\nAnd that's on everythin', that metal bang? Y'all ain't savin' money with Geico\nThis is what greatness is\nYou clowns are just plagarists\nTryin' to sneak a scheme past Stephen King\nOh wow, well I created It\nAin't no secret that I'm a lil' nigga\nBut I can finally say \"lil' nigga\" cause this kid 5'2\"\nBut I won't!\nBecause the big niggas in front of me be lookin' his size, too!\nI'm just in a different zone, and Money Talks so a stretcher is what I leave my victim on\nSee how y'all just rappin'? Wordplay?\nI haven't played with a word since I started rappin'\nSo if you lookin' for a nigga to embarrass you...you couldn't have picked a better dude\nColossal impact, even at eye level I level you\nSo that legend status I just have to critique\nYou went from rappin' with Pete\nGettin' accolades to just tryin' to rap to compete\nSee them accolades is what made you important you fuckin' gargoyle\nOnly on the stat you (statue) a beast\nBut me? I'm just in a different zone, damn near impossible to stop\nLift the Glock, all that talk and equip the dot, period, sentence stop\nSo play yo' part, because them Cali trees can't even see the fire my name can start\nI hit grandpa, big hammer\nEven fix grandma (grammar) like language arts and I ain't finished\nYou been here forever, so how can you have what the game missin'?\nSee, that's why my style so copied by these lame niggas\nSame gimmick, start dissectin' a style that come out\nIt'll be like reachin' in a couch in my house\nI guarantee you it's mine if you find some change in it\nBut I'm not lyin', I used t get criticized daily in the ring for my crimes\nAs of lately, ain't no debate from it, cause they know this one, 800's, just from hot lines\nSo what you got for me? A bunch of corny-ass jokes that's not funny?\nWell, I aim, and niggas die\nI go to sleep and wake up right next to the ratchet and even banger (bang her) to the side\nNigga, Grim Reaper, Crypt Keeper, I bring that same pain to niggas lives\nSo be outstandin' cause I'm out standin' with a chopper\nSo put on a cape and lose half yo' face like The Phantom Of The Opera\nBitch I'm here to state the facts, our mind got a generation gap\nSo he might not make it home this evenin'\nCause the pain you receivin' has gotten worse\nNot even Saga church gon' save you from this beatin'\nI'm unstoppable\nAn Illmaculate bag for Illmaculate? Probable\nI mean you came here to punch\nIt shouldn't be a shock to you that I'm boxin' you\nYou get shit back, with a note from me\nAnd they only get half like show money\nEither show money or seal the boy fate\nCause we all usin' 'em to make a statement, right?\nBut I notarize mine before the court case\nIt's body bags at every battle, make sure your homie found one\nBut do not jump into that bitch yet cause this is only round one\nYou might also like[Round 2: Illmac]\nI see his little run, he's tryna get the throne\nWell I'll open your chest with chrome\nStop your heart's metronome\nYou made a good point, I am a legend known\nAnd I am a Gargoyle, I'm a beast that's set in stone\nJC, K exposed you\nDude was caught dressin' in bootleg TRU Religions like you was all flexing\nMan how you let 'em turn your wardrobe into a TRU or false question?\nSpeaking of religions, Jesus initials right?\nWell if dude was Christ, that would be jokes to me\nBecause he could probably be crucified on an actual rosary\nBow ya head and pray to Christ\nYou been going in circles your whole career, without the racing stripes\nWell Shake n Bake baby, now I'm at the table hyped\nCause they got me praying on Baby Jesus; Talladega Nights\nRight, attitude? Like fuck living\nSon dissin'? That's when the ratchet come out like drunk women\nSlugs hit 'em, he don't get the TEC's (text) message?\nChopper in the trunk hidden\nI'll put J in front of the K - Just Kidding\nSnuff victim\nHappened so fast they're like \"Did he just hit him?\"\nSecond punch lift 'em\nNow they're positive, it was uplifting\nAct defiant, while fans are whining\nAsking why I'm, rapping violent and straps are flying\nWell, what you think that I'm lying?\nYou catch my last battle? Fine then\nYou already know I know how to handle Iron\nBut you, made a video... dancing for Chris Stokes\nShit's DOPE!\nI mean, bro, did you just want your name in his mouth? Is that about attention?\nNow he does mention you, among other kids he brags about molestin'\nIt was who wants to be a child star, turned casting couch confession\nAsk what happened, he'll break a sweat, shake his head - and dance around the question\nYou know what? That's irrelevant you know why that's irrelevant?\nCause he don't dance now, he make money moves\n30 bucks a battle, he ain't pullin' Lux's views\nAt end of the day, see your whole little run, bro, that shit's irrelevant man\nDo you wanna know why? Do you wanna know why?\nHe got a couple wins, he calling for match-ups, great\nNow you calling out Lux, hold up, back up, wait\nI mean you get love from the fans, but here's where the gas pump breaks\nThat whole run is a shame, think 21 Grams, those bodies didn't hold that much weight\nYou know what, you ain't body nobody notable\nWhat you beat Chess, Trez? Maaaaan that's what you was supposed to do!\nNow he making lateral moves, acting like he fuckin' ODing\nReminding me of Forrest Gump this whole season\nJust on a run for no reason\nThe people you aspire to battle, I'm acknowledged as their peer\nWhen I talk to 'em, it's like talking to a mirror\nThis your conscience getting clear\nMotherfuckers like you come and go, they were gone as they appeared\nWhat you been hot a couple years?\nBitch I got winning streaks as long as your career\nHe actually fooled people into thinkin' he deserves Lux, it's a nice movement you got here\nWhile you're at it, give Born, Hollow, give Trez, Mook if he wants, yea\nSMACK can play Oprah like \"Nahm'sayin', you get a top tier! You get a top tier! You get a top tier!\"\nQuestion, what's DJ Pauly D calling out Tony Touch?\nQuestion, what's Bill Gates suin' a homeless drunk?\nQuestion, what's a NY Legend battlin' some dude who mostly sucks\nI guess the perfect analogy is you and Loaded Lux\nOn one hand, an up and comer, just tryna get his name to here\nOn the other, Lux doing favors, not ending J's career\nI see it from both sides like interrogation mirrors\nHe thinks Lux is balling/bawling so he's crying for the match, that's what separates their tiers/tears\nYou out here calling names, like a rookie, having his first solid game\nThinkin' he earned a spot in the Hall of Fame\nBut dawg, you know what? You know what? Shit gets worse\nWhat's an intern, applying for a CEO position first?\nThat was a Loaded question, but he's gon' get this work\nImagine Loaded... getting tweeted by Jay Z\nThinking \"Ain't nothing left now but competin' with JC.\"\nSee I sit back, watch 'em chase his small fame\nIt's way beyond lame\nLook, think Jayceon's name\nCause if name dropping the Game JC on/Jayceon then tonight I'm putting Jayceon/JC on Game\nIt ain't a game we on, play me wrong and get a change of heart\nOr pistol whip him til the handle's red like Maker's Mark\nIf ya clique want it too then which one of you want your nose split?\nI'll break the bridge up in two like a fucking ship's coming through\nHe shoulda just stuck in his lane\nCause now when Loaded declines, ain't much that remains\nJust fortune cookie wisdom, stuck in his brain\nGetting that small paper, saying that Lux's/luck's gonna change\nThe bias is real, ain't no doin' enough\nPeople will say I lose if I won and if you lose then it's luck\nSo who gives a fuck, I hope you do get Lux\nAnd you have to battle on the roof... in front of everyone that rooted for you from the jump!\nBut the truth, the sad truth, is that Lux is your full potential, and it just bothers you you can see it\nAnd I'm just an obligation that stopped you before you reached it\nIll!\n[Round 2: JC]\nI have no clue why I'm here, yeah now I'm just keepin' it real\nBut you gon' be that nigga I leave in the field\nI kill to say it sadly\nAvery Bradley how I reach for the Steel\nHead shots, I do shit how I want to 'Mac\nAnd that's my way, you wanna perform for the artist\nI wanna storm through a Target like Black Friday\nThat's real shit, the steel spit\nYou get a buck 50 for talkin', we seal lips\nNigga you won't even hear a name flip tonight, but we still spittin'\nHit everybody, watch him head in the office, now his bitch tryna run; oh they the real Clintons\nI got complacent when I first saw my piece of the cake\nLike, \"Just my portion is fine.\"\nBut then I changed it with time\nNow I shoot over a line like the game on the line\nSo how dare you say I'm not one you see as a legend\nRight now I'm givin' a shot, you niggas just need some protection\nI shoot accurate, you [?] completely in seconds\nNeedin' a reverend, missin' everything from your heartbeat to your necklace\nBitch I been the sickest\nAnd the nine special like a director's cut, the clip extended\nAnd we gon' leave him stuck, shit the nigga skipped admission and he gon keep the bucks\nThe shit all enlightenin', like when Jesus comin'\nBut you gon' be standin' there with the mixtape verse Rex face\nDyin' over and over, Happy Death Day\nNow if this shit is all about image, why is you tryin' so hard to convince these niggas into believin' yo' statements?\nNo talkin', either leave this closed (disclosed) or end up in a secret location\nThis a fast fight...literally\nI finished it last night\nMad late, but I'm patient with time and great with the nine\nA bullet go straight in spine like a back brace, we need you up right\nBecause this one night ain't about increasin' the peace\nShit you'll get beat with the piece like you Pun wife\nYou was supposed to blow up from them 2 on 2's in 2007\n2007 Mr. New York and 50 grand\n2007 and that's when your name was important\nBut you couldn't, cause all the hot shit came from The Saurus\nAnd you was piggy backin', bitchin', actin'\nFrontin' like you play the part, you coulda won a Oscar\nThe truth is, he had you on his back so fuckin' long y'all could become a chopper\nNow you figure, with JC in front of you, you can finally get that recognition with a lil' letter to stamp there\nWon't work\nYou are as noticeable as a wave...in Kevin Durant hair\nWe don't see you ever!\nBelieve you? Never!\nY'all niggas kinda forgot and I get it\nY'all are just in line for the shot\nBut this execution by way of firin' squad\nAnd shoot accurate, dead on\nI don't come for the scuffles\nThink it's a game and die clear in a round...nothin' but Trouble\nI don't even need an openin' when the can' spittin'\nShit I'll take any shot I'm ambitious\nSome times I go buy shit just to fry it like when fam' visit\nAnd I know you prolly think this yo' grand ticket\nBut this battle rap, our house, no new wars\nI make you do chores\nIf I get abusive, fine\nBut if I lose my mind you lose yours\nAnd I don't care to find it because they too narrowminded\nThinkin' this a one day step\nAlways worrin' about buyin' an outline until a body in an outline is the only one they left\nRound 2 nigga\n\n[Round 3: Illmac]\nYou said I'm a wave in Kevin Durant's hair, that line did not suck\nHang ten bro, too bad you the one getting washed up\nIt's funny I lost the chain, they think my reputation's tarnished\nBut they even stripped the title from Mohammed, I'm saying I'm a heavyweight regardless\nI do my job and it pays off, that's what separates us artists\nI put my work in good will/Good Will, that's why my resume's retarded\nI'm talking wins on Clips, Dizaster, Chilla, Pat Stay\nBodies on Verb, Real Deal, Iron Solomon, DNA\nI'm fresh off a body like Drake, sending bottles to Charlemagne\nThat's what fucking with my pen entails/pinnin' tails and you're just Donkey of the Day\nFreestyle, Grind Time, King Of The Dot, Pearly Gates\nLast of a Rare Breed to stay on top when the eras change\nI heard strippers were on strike in NY, that's ironic in several ways\nCause if you strip down battle rap I got bodies at every stage\nYa'' got 'em acting, like he's always sick - hypochondriac-tin'\nYour drive is stagnant\nMaking moves, going nowhere, you lost in transit\nYou making moves, going nowhere, actually you locked in traffic\nBut I'll give him his big break, go 'head sign 'em - after I body cast him\nMark 'em out while he stuck in the same position, my signature move - I autograph him\nYou stay shook, coffee addict\nRight hook, jaw gets damaged\nMouth stickin' out the side while you talkin' like a Boston accent\nYou never caught a body, you got framed, you Roger Rabbit\nI bodied Clips then he 'bodied' Clips, that ain't a body, bitch - you just caught the casket\nYou tough as food stains on cotton fabric\nWhich explains why he sticks around until he gets washed and Vanish\nDryer sheets, in your laundry basket\nLil' homie you don't want no static\nI'll have his parents rocking black and Johnny Cash 'em\nRun his jewels, stick 'em over ice - hockey slash 'em\nGet found dead in the hills, Arrowhead in his grill - I'll Pontiac 'em\nAir 'em out, toxic gasses\nStretch 'em out, Pilates classes\nYou soft J, what y'all didn't catch it?\nI'm saying you soft J, fuck am I talking Spanish?\nMijo, ya bitch, soon as we touched down - we didn't even make a play at her\nSmashed mouth without running game, change the play pattern\nHad her wetter than a winning coach soaked in Gatorade after\nThe whole team ran through it like the break away banner\nDon't blame me, the hoe asked for it, go grab the bitch\nKill the pussy I'm toe tagging it\nBefore a medic can react when I stretch her in the back - whoop - no ambulance\nI look at your hoodie, and I'm like, \"Go Kaepernick\"\nThat means I won't stand for it\nGasoline, broke lantern shit\nThat means my whole camp is lit\nThat's fire\nI won't angle 'em, room shakers - the whole planet shift\nThrow hands with 'em\nYou gon' need a couple hosts, panelists and a show analyst\nTo see J black/Jay Blac on a known Champion\n\n[Round 3: JC]\nYou know what I realized?\nEverything that he poppin' fo' today happened back in 2007\nThankfully at the Pearly Gates they found you Heaven\nCause that was it\nSad as shit\nGet up or get outta the game\nKaepernick you should've played to him\nCause the fact that you didn't gon' make this all worse, you headed that way\nAnd you riskin' rejection cause you didn't call first\nGet right wit him\nYou 'bout to die just tryna write wit him\nI like killin', but that first coffin (coughin') that's just a light symptom, it gets much worse\nThe fact that you still tryin' to rap and nobody care, trust hurts\n'Specially when you do fall back and nobody there\nLife sucks doesn't it?\nAnd yours is endin' because of it\nAnd I only got a couple more drills in my lab jacket and he just lab rattin'\nBut you will never get no real runnin' on wheels\nSo life's comin' to a close, get the shovel\nHe tried to punch wit a nigga grippin' metal\nOf course I can elevate a nigga\nEvery round is a different level\nThey won't even call this close\nDon't leave all exposed when that valve to your heart get closed\nAnd the docs catch that accapella, I'm talkin' dead beat; Maury Show\nSo avoid the shit, niggas only hate these bars when they die from it\nTime limits and how slow people rap, blowin' shit outta proportion\nKickin' out bitch emotions, that's exactly how an over react (ovary act)\nBut thankfully, no matter where we at, you have to bleed\nEven on stage my first line caution taped half the scene\nI even killed in the hood like Assassin's Creed\nY'all niggas came to throw shots and punches\nNow I'm thinkin' bombs or choppers with the scopes\nThat's my peepin' Tom\nI'm out the window wit it\nMirror match, Illmac' could get served with a MAC\nThen I spin the block with more of it\nMark Morrison, it's the Return Of The Mack\nDon't ego trip because you wasn't seein' [?] worse shit til you was seen verse me on this card\nSo don't think that bullshit you writin' would bring you this far\nI mean this one bout, is like finally landin' that haymaker on Punch-Out!\nThey just wanna see Little Mac swing with the stars\nSo how do you plan on progressin' now?\nIf you gon' be doin' those same schemes later\nSee, you just existin', I made the scene greater\nYou don't need skills for droppin' facts\nJust like you don't need a Mill (mil') for droppin' mac like Dreamchaser\nYou niggas will never hear shit this sweet\nY'all niggas hear lines y'all didn't get for weeks\nBut be swearin' y'all had every rhyme\nThen hear shit that point back to the line like a widow peak\nI'm a permanent mark, never mind Pearly Gates\nYou see the Devil I blaze the steel, then bombs drop\nI'm literally gon' level the playin' field\nIt's all about head shots, by me, pretty accurate too, even behind scenes\nI'm Harvey Weinstein without the harassment in suits\nThat just mean I grab the ratchets and shoot\nNow how unfair is this?\nHow I can this and take these rhymes as a weapon\nIn a battle about gun violence but still make it as one sided as a vampire reflection\nIllmac' it's over wit!\nOverdose from the dopest pen\nY'all know I wrote the shit cause every battle turn into a eulogy\nMy condolencesEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

(battlefield)\nSo all that bumping gums, and talking down\nThat shit'll get you killed (get you killed)\n\n[Z-Ro]\nI wake up early in the evening, roll myself a cigarillo\nWe talk to my Guerilla Maab, niggas'll roll solo\nAll these other rap niggas, act so PH-banish\nStraight up strong enough for a man, but just too weak to take the challenge\nAnd each way with display, they got no back bone\nThey looking like jellyfish to me, about to get they back blown\nCause we ride on niggas, and disguise on niggas\nGlock cocked we hop out, and surprise on niggas\nYou in danger, I've never been a stranger to homicide\nCause in my hood, we kill eachother just to stay alive\nIt's Screwed, so I fuck with Rap-A-Lot but I'm still broke\nCan't afford to stay in the 4 Seasons, but I still smoke\nWhy y'all niggas fucking with me, I wanna be free\nBut jealousy and envy, be watching me planning on stopping me\nFuck that, I'm a Ridgemont 4 gangsta and I bust back\nSouthsi' for li' Familia, until I'm on my back\n[Hook]\n\n[Trae]\nI'm a bonified soldier, in the G to the T\nMotherfuckers be screaming murder, on T-R-A-E\nEveryday when I grind, I gotta get it like it's my last breath\nFuck what them niggas thinking, hit my corner they mean death\nThe youngest of the Maab, but I'ma stomp like a big dog\nPresidential be hating, now my Glock saying fuck y'all\nRo pass the word, let me show em how it go\nCause I ain't playing with bitches, I'm disposing all of my foes\nWe M double A-B, S-L-A-B till I'm dead\nEverynight I be on the edge, with a pump onside of my bed\nGoing retarded, cause niggas take this game for a joke\nEternally burning, I'm bout to put this bitch up in smoke\nThey must be on dope, thinking the court of law gon resolve it\nIf my brother Dinkie was here, I swear to God he would bomb it\nRest in peace to my niggas, that we lost in the field\nFor real, disrespect it and you gon fuck around and get killed\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Z-Ro]\nNever slipping whether I'm smoking, and I'm dranking or not\nRaising so much hell in the streets, niggas thinking demons is hot\nIs in our blood it's in our body, it's in our soul\nYou Jesus don't let me click, cause if I lose it I might stroll\nRight up on them Presidential niggas, read em they rights\nRevenge or retaliation, or motherfucking gun fight\nNow you done fucked with me, so it's a must that I fuck with you\nHow you gon sue me, and you bootlegging dude\nYou might also like[Trae]\nNiggas be smoking, how the fuck you gon fuck with the Maab\nI been repping since '96, from the booth to the Boulevard\nWe work hard paying dues, in this god damn game\nAnd these broke ass bitch niggas, wanna roach off the name\nCan't give a fuck about your team, or give a fuck if you was paid\nThe only thing I give a fuck about, is locked up in a cage\nAnd I'm meaning what I scream, ain't no way to shut me up\nTill you put me in a grave, and nigga I don't give a fuck I'm a asshole\n\n[Hook]\n\nFuck with y'all...\nIn the

The door into the dining room is shut. It is morning. MRS. STOCKMANN, with a sealed letter in her hand, comes in from the dining room, goes to the door of the DOCTOR'S study, and peeps in.)\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nAre you in, Thomas?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(from within his room). Yes, I have just come in. (Comes into the room.) What is it?\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nA letter from your brother.\nDR. STOCKMANN\nAha, let us see! (Opens the letter and reads:) \"I return herewith the manuscript you sent me\" (reads on in a low murmur) H'm!\u2014\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nWhat does he say?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(putting the papers in his pocket). Oh, he only writes that he will come up here himself about midday.\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nWell, try and remember to be at home this time.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nThat will be all right; I have got through all my morning visits.\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nI am extremely curious to know how he takes it.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYou will see he won't like it's having been I, and not he, that made the discovery.\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nAren't you a little nervous about that?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nOh, he really will be pleased enough, you know. But, at the same time, Peter is so confoundedly afraid of anyone's doing any service to the town except himself.\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nI will tell you what, Thomas\u2014you should be good natured, and share the credit of this with him. Couldn't you make out that it was he who set you on the scent of this discovery?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI am quite willing. If only I can get the thing set right. I\u2014\n\n(MORTEN KIIL puts his head in through the door leading from the hall, looks around in an enquiring manner, and chuckles.)\n\nMORTEN KIIL\n(slyly). Is it\u2014is it true?\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\n(going to the door). Father!\u2014is it you?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nAh, Mr. Kiil\u2014good morning, good morning!\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nBut come along in.\n\nMORTEN KIIL\nIf it is true, I will; if not, I am off.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nIf what is true?\nMORTEN KIIL\nTThis tale about the water supply, is it true?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nCertainly it is true, but how did you come to hear it?\n\nMORTEN KIIL\n(coming in). Petra ran in on her way to the school\u2014\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nDid she?\n\nMORTEN KIIL\nYes; and she declares that\u2014I thought she was only making a fool of me\u2014but it isn't like Petra to do that.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nOf course not. How could you imagine such a thing!\n\nMORTEN KIIL\nOh well, it is better never to trust anybody; you may find you have been made a fool of before you know where you are. But it is really true, all the same?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYou can depend upon it that it is true. Won't you sit down? (Settles him on the couch.) Isn't it a real bit of luck for the town\u2014\n\nMORTEN KIIL\n(suppressing his laughter). A bit of luck for the town?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes, that I made the discovery in good time.\n\nMORTEN KIIL\n(as before). Yes, yes, Yes!\u2014But I should never have thought you the sort of man to pull your own brother's leg like this!\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nPull his leg!\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nReally, father dear\u2014\n\nMORTEN KIIL\n(resting his hands and his chin on the handle of his stick and winking slyly at the DOCTOR). Let me see, what was the story? Some kind of beast that had got into the water-pipes, wasn't it?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nInfusoria\u2014yes.\n\nMORTEN KIIL\nAnd a lot of these beasts had got in, according to Petra\u2014a tremendous lot.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nCertainly; hundreds of thousands of them, probably.\n\nMORTEN KIIL\nBut no one can see them\u2014isn't that so?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes; you can't see them,\n\nMORTEN KIIL\n(with a quiet chuckle). Damn\u2014it's the finest story I have ever heard!\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWhat do you mean?\n\nMORTEN KIIL\nBut you will never get the Mayor to believe a thing like that.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWe shall see.\n\nMORTEN KIIL\nDo you think he will be fool enough to\u2014?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI hope the whole town will be fools enough.\n\nMORTEN KIIL\nThe whole town! Well, it wouldn't be a bad thing. It would just serve them right, and teach them a lesson. They think themselves so much cleverer than we old fellows. They hounded me out of the council; they did, I tell you\u2014they hounded me out. Now they shall pay for it. You pull their legs too, Thomas!\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nReally, I\u2014\n\nMORTEN KIIL\nYou pull their legs! (Gets up.) If you can work it so that the Mayor and his friends all swallow the same bait, I will give ten pounds to a charity\u2014like a shot!\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nThat is very kind of you.\n\nMORTEN KIIL\nYes, I haven't got much money to throw away, I can tell you; but, if you can work this, I will give five pounds to a charity at Christmas.\n\n(HOVSTAD comes in by the hall door.)\n\nHOVSTAD\nGood morning! (Stops.) Oh, I beg your pardon\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nNot at all; come in.\n\nMORTEN KIIL\n(with another chuckle). Oho!\u2014is he in this too?\n\nHOVSTAD\nWhat do you mean?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nCertainly he is.\n\nMORTEN KIIL\nI might have known it! It must get into the papers. You know how to do it, Thomas! Set your wits to work. Now I must go.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWon't you stay a little while?\n\nMORTEN KIIL\nNo, I must be off now. You keep up this game for all it is worth; you won't repent it, I'm damned if you will!\n\n(He goes out; MRS. STOCKMANN follows him into the hall.)\n\nDr. Stockmann\n(laughing). Just imagine\u2014the old chap doesn't believe a word of all this about the water supply.\n\nHOVSTAD\nOh that was it, then?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes, that was what we were talking about. Perhaps it is the same thing that brings you here?\n\nHOVSTAD\nYes, it is, Can you spare me a few minutes, Doctor?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nAs long as you like, my dear fellow.\n\nHOVSTAD\nHave you heard from the Mayor yet?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nNot yet. He is coming here later.\n\nHOVSTAD\nI have given the matter a great deal of thought since last night.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWell?\n\nHOVSTAD\nFrom your point of view, as a doctor and a man of science, this affair of the water supply is an isolated matter. I mean, you do not realise that it involves a great many other things.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nHow, do you mean?\u2014Let us sit down, my dear fellow. No, sit here on the couch. (HOVSTAD Sits down on the couch, DR. STOCKMANN On a chair on the other side of the table.) Now then. You mean that\u2014?\n\nHOVSTAD\nYou said yesterday that the pollution of the water was due to impurities in the soil.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes, unquestionably it is due to that poisonous morass up at Molledal.\n\nHOVSTAD\nBegging your pardon, Doctor, I fancy it is due to quite another morass altogether.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWhat morass?\n\nHOVSTAD\nThe morass that the whole life of our town is built on and is rotting in.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWhat the deuce are you driving at, Hovstad?\n\nHOVSTAD\nThe whole of the town's interests have, little by little, got into the hands of a pack of officials.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nOh, come!\u2014they are not all officials.\n\nHOVSTAD\nNo, but those that are not officials are at any rate the officials' friends and adherents; it is the wealthy folk, the old families in the town, that have got us entirely in their hands.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes, but after all they are men of ability and knowledge.\n\nHOVSTAD\nDid they show any ability or knowledge when they laid the conduit pipes where they are now?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nNo, of course that was a great piece of stupidity on their part. But that is going to be set right now.\n\nHOVSTAD\nDo you think that will be all such plain sailing?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nPlain sailing or no, it has got to be done, anyway.\n\nHOVSTAD\nYes, provided the press takes up the question.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI don't think that will be necessary, my dear fellow, I am certain my brother\u2014\n\nHOVSTAD\nExcuse me, doctor; I feel bound to tell you I am inclined to take the matter up.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nIn the paper?\n\nHOVSTAD\nYes. When I took over the \"People's Messenger\" my idea was to break up this ring of self-opinionated old fossils who had got hold of all the influence.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nBut you know you told me yourself what the result had been; you nearly ruined your paper.\n\nHOVSTAD\nYes, at the time we were obliged to climb down a peg or two, it is quite true\u2014because there was a danger of the whole project of the Baths coming to nothing if they failed us. But now the scheme has been carried through, and we can dispense with these grand gentlemen.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nDispense with them, yes; but, we owe them a great debt of gratitude.\n\nHOVSTAD\nThat shall be recognised ungrudgingly, But a journalist of my democratic tendencies cannot let such an opportunity as this slip. The bubble of official infallibility must be pricked. This superstition must be destroyed, like any other.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI am whole-heartedly with you in that, Mr. Hovstad; if it is a superstition, away with it!\n\nHOVSTAD\nI should be very reluctant to bring the Mayor into it, because he is your brother. But I am sure you will agree with me that truth should be the first consideration.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nThat goes without saying. (With sudden emphasis.) Yes, but\u2014but\u2014\n\nHOVSTAD\nYou must not misjudge me. I am neither more self-interested nor more ambitious than most men.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nMy dear fellow\u2014who suggests anything of the kind?\n\nHOVSTAD\nI am of humble origin, as you know; and that has given me opportunities of knowing what is the most crying need in the humbler ranks of life. It is that they should be allowed some part in the direction of public affairs, Doctor. That is what will develop their faculties and intelligence and self respect\u2014\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI quite appreciate that.\n\nHOVSTAD\nYes\u2014and in my opinion a journalist incurs a heavy responsibility if he neglects a favourable opportunity of emancipating the masses\u2014the humble and oppressed. I know well enough that in exalted circles I shall be called an agitator, and all that sort of thing; but they may call what they like. If only my conscience doesn't reproach me, then\u2014\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nQuite right! Quite right, Mr. Hovstad. But all the same\u2014devil take it! (A knock is heard at the door.) Come in!\n\n(ASLAKSEN appears at the door. He is poorly but decently dressed, in black, with a slightly crumpled white neckcloth; he wears gloves and has a felt hat in his hand.)\n\nASLAKSEN\n(bowing). Excuse my taking the liberty, Doctor\u2014\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(getting up). Ah, it is you, Aslaksen!\n\nASLAKSEN\nYes, Doctor.\n\nHOVSTAD\n(standing up). Is it me you want, Aslaksen?\n\nASLAKSEN\nNo; I didn't know I should find you here. No, it was the Doctor I\u2014\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI am quite at your service. What is it?\n\nASLAKSEN\nIs what I heard from Mr. Billing true, sir\u2014that you mean to improve our water supply?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes, for the Baths.\n\nASLAKSEN\nQuite so, I understand. Well, I have come to say that I will back that up by every means in my power.\n\nHOVSTAD\n(to the DOCTOR). You see!\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI shall be very grateful to you, but\u2014\n\nASLAKSEN\nBecause it may be no bad thing to have us small tradesmen at your back. We form, as it were, a compact majority in the town\u2014if we choose. And it is always a good thing to have the majority with you, Doctor.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nThat is undeniably true; but I confess I don't see why such unusual precautions should be necessary in this case. It seems to me that such a plain, straightforward thing.\n\nASLAKSEN\nOh, it may be very desirable, all the same. I know our local authorities so well; officials are not generally very ready to act on proposals that come from other people. That is why I think it would not be at all amiss if we made a little demonstration.\n\nHOVSTAD\nThat's right.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nDemonstration, did you say? What on earth are you going to make a demonstration about?\n\nASLAKSEN\nWe shall proceed with the greatest moderation, Doctor. Moderation is always my aim; it is the greatest virtue in a citizen\u2014at least, I think so.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nIt is well known to be a characteristic of yours, Mr. Aslaksen.\n\nASLAKSEN\nYes, I think I may pride myself on that. And this matter of the water supply is of the greatest importance to us small tradesmen. The Baths promise to be a regular gold-mine for the town. We shall all make our living out of them, especially those of us who are householders. That is why we will back up the project as strongly as possible. And as I am at present Chairman of the Householders' Association.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes\u2014?\n\nASLAKSEN\nAnd, what is more, local secretary of the Temperance Society\u2014you know, sir, I suppose, that I am a worker in the temperance cause?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nOf course, of course.\n\nASLAKSEN\nWell, you can understand that I come into contact with a great many people. And as I have the reputation of a temperate and law-abiding citizen\u2014like yourself, Doctor\u2014I have a certain influence in the town, a little bit of power, if I may be allowed to say so.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI know that quite well, Mr. Aslaksen.\n\nASLAKSEN\nSo you see it would be an easy matter for me to set on foot some testimonial, if necessary.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nA testimonial?\n\nASLAKSEN\nYes, some kind of an address of thanks from the townsmen for your share in a matter of such importance to the community. I need scarcely say that it would have to be drawn up with the greatest regard to moderation, so as not to offend the authorities\u2014who, after all, have the reins in their hands. If we pay strict attention to that, no one can take it amiss, I should think!\n\nHOVSTAD\nWell, and even supposing they didn't like it\u2014\n\nASLAKSEN\nNo, no, no; there must be no discourtesy to the authorities, Mr. Hovstad. It is no use falling foul of those upon whom our welfare so closely depends. I have done that in my time, and no good ever comes of it. But no one can take exception to a reasonable and frank expression of a citizen's views.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(shaking him by the hand). I can't tell you, dear Mr. Aslaksen, how extremely pleased I am to find such hearty support among my fellow-citizens. I am delighted\u2014delighted! Now, you will take a small glass of sherry, eh?\n\nASLAKSEN\nNo, thank you; I never drink alcohol of that kind.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWell, what do you say to a glass of beer, then?\n\nASLAKSEN\nNor that either, thank you, Doctor. I never drink anything as early as this. I am going into town now to talk this over with one or two householders, and prepare the ground.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nIt is tremendously kind of you, Mr. Aslaksen; but I really cannot understand the necessity for all these precautions. It seems to me that the thing should go of itself.\n\nASLAKSEN\nThe authorities are somewhat slow to move, Doctor. Far be it from me to seem to blame them\u2014\n\nHOVSTAD\nWe are going to stir them up in the paper tomorrow, Aslaksen.\n\nASLAKSEN\nBut not violently, I trust, Mr. Hovstad. Proceed with moderation, or you will do nothing with them. You may take my advice; I have gathered my experience in the school of life. Well, I must say goodbye, Doctor. You know now that we small tradesmen are at your back at all events, like a solid wall. You have the compact majority on your side Doctor.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI am very much obliged, dear Mr. Aslaksen, (Shakes hands with him.) Goodbye, goodbye.\n\nASLAKSEN\nAre you going my way, towards the printing-office. Mr. Hovstad?\n\nHOVSTAD\nI will come later; I have something to settle up first.\n\nASLAKSEN\nVery well. (Bows and goes out; STOCKMANN follows him into the hall.)\n\nHOVSTAD\n(as STOCKMANN comes in again). Well, what do you think of that, Doctor? Don't you think it is high time we stirred a little life into all this slackness and vacillation and cowardice?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nAre you referring to Aslaksen?\n\nHOVSTAD\nYes, I am. He is one of those who are floundering in a bog\u2014decent enough fellow though he may be, otherwise. And most of the people here are in just the same case\u2014see-sawing and edging first to one side and then to the other, so overcome with caution and scruple that they never dare to take any decided step.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes, but Aslaksen seemed to me so thoroughly well-intentioned.\n\nHOVSTAD\nThere is one thing I esteem higher than that; and that is for a man to be self-reliant and sure of himself.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI think you are perfectly right there.\n\nHOVSTAD\nThat is why I want to seize this opportunity, and try if I cannot manage to put a little virility into these well-intentioned people for once. The idol of Authority must be shattered in this town. This gross and inexcusable blunder about the water supply must be brought home to the mind of every municipal voter.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nVery well; if you are of opinion that it is for the good of the community, so be it. But not until I have had a talk with my brother.\n\nHOVSTAD\nAnyway, I will get a leading article ready; and if the Mayor refuses to take the matter up\u2014\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nHow can you suppose such a thing possible!\n\nHOVSTAD\nIt is conceivable. And in that case\u2014\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nIn that case I promise you\u2014. Look here, in that case you may print my report\u2014every word of it.\n\nHOVSTAD\nMay I? Have I your word for it?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(giving him the MS.). Here it is; take it with you. It can do no harm for you to read it through, and you can give it me back later on.\n\nHOVSTAD\nGood, good! That is what I will do. And now goodbye, Doctor.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nGoodbye, goodbye. You will see everything will run quite smoothly, Mr. Hovstad\u2014quite smoothly.\n\nHOVSTAD\nHm!\u2014we shall see. (Bows and goes out.)\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(opens the dining-room door and looks in). Katherine! Oh, you are back, Petra?\n\nPETRA\n(coming in). Yes, I have just come from the school.\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\n(coming in). Has he not been here yet?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nPeter? No, but I have had a long talk with Hovstad. He is quite excited about my discovery, I find it has a much wider bearing than I at first imagined. And he has put his paper at my disposal if necessity should arise.\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nDo you think it will?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nNot for a moment. But at all events it makes me feel proud to know that I have the liberal-minded independent press on my side. Yes, and just imagine\u2014I have had a visit from the Chairman of the Householders' Association!\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nOh! What did he want?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nTo offer me his support too. They will support me in a body if it should be necessary. Katherine\u2014do you know what I have got behind me?\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nBehind you? No, what have you got behind you?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nThe compact majority.\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nReally? Is that a good thing for you Thomas?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI should think it was a good thing. (Walks up and down rubbing his hands.) By Jove, it's a fine thing to feel this bond of brotherhood between oneself and one's fellow citizens!\nPETRA\nAnd to be able to do so much that is good and useful, father!\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nAnd for one's own native town into the bargain, my child!\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nThat was a ring at the bell.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nIt must be he, then. (A knock is heard at the door.) Come in!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\n(comes in from the hall). Good morning.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nGlad to see you, Peter!\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nGood morning, Peter, How are you?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nSo so, thank you. (To DR. STOCKMANN.) I received from you yesterday, after office hours, a report dealing with the condition of the water at the Baths.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes. Have you read it?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nYes, I have,\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nAnd what have you to say to it?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\n(with a sidelong glance). Hm!\u2014\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nCome along, Petra. (She and PETRA go into the room on the left.)\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\n(after a pause). Was it necessary to make all these investigations behind my back?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes, because until I was absolutely certain about it\u2014\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nThen you mean that you are absolutely certain now?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nSurely you are convinced of that.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nIs it your intention to bring this document before the Baths Committee as a sort of official communication?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nCertainly. Something must be done in the matter\u2014and that quickly.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nAs usual, you employ violent expressions in your report. You say, amongst other things, that what we offer visitors in our Baths is a permanent supply of poison.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWell, can you describe it any other way, Peter? Just think\u2014water that is poisonous, whether you drink it or bathe in it! And this we offer to the poor sick folk who come to us trustfully and pay us at an exorbitant rate to be made well again!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nAnd your reasoning leads you to this conclusion, that we must build a sewer to draw off the alleged impurities from Molledal and must relay the water conduits.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes. Do you see any other way out of it? I don't.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nI made a pretext this morning to go and see the town engineer, and, as if only half seriously, broached the subject of these proposals as a thing we might perhaps have to take under consideration some time later on.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nSome time later on!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nHe smiled at what he considered to be my extravagance, naturally. Have you taken the trouble to consider what your proposed alterations would cost? According to the information I obtained, the expenses would probably mount up to fifteen or twenty thousand pounds.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWould it cost so much?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nYes; and the worst part of it would be that the work would take at least two years.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nTwo years? Two whole years?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nAt least. And what are we to do with the Baths in the meantime? Close them? Indeed we should be obliged to. And do you suppose anyone would come near the place after it had got out that the water was dangerous?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes but, Peter, that is what it is.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nAnd all this at this juncture\u2014just as the Baths are beginning to be known. There are other towns in the neighbourhood with qualifications to attract visitors for bathing purposes. Don't you suppose they would immediately strain every nerve to divert the entire stream of strangers to themselves? Unquestionably they would; and then where should we be? We should probably have to abandon the whole thing, which has cost us so much money-and then you would have ruined your native town.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI\u2014should have ruined\u2014!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nIt is simply and solely through the Baths that the town has before it any future worth mentioning. You know that just as well as I.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nBut what do you think ought to be done, then?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nYour report has not convinced me that the condition of the water at the Baths is as bad as you represent it to be.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI tell you it is even worse!\u2014or at all events it will be in summer, when the warm weather comes.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nAs I said, I believe you exaggerate the matter considerably. A capable physician ought to know what measures to take\u2014he ought to be capable of preventing injurious influences or of remedying them if they become obviously persistent.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWell? What more?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nThe water supply for the Baths is now an established fact, and in consequence must be treated as such. But probably the Committee, at its discretion, will not be disinclined to consider the question of how far it might be possible to introduce certain improvements consistently with a reasonable expenditure.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nAnd do you suppose that I will have anything to do with such a piece of trickery as that?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nTrickery!!\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes, it would be a trick\u2014a fraud, a lie, a downright crime towards the public, towards the whole community!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nI have not, as I remarked before, been able to convince myself that there is actually any imminent danger.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYou have! It is impossible that you should not be convinced. I know I have represented the facts absolutely truthfully and fairly. And you know it very well, Peter, only you won't acknowledge it. It was owing to your action that both the Baths and the water conduits were built where they are; and that is what you won't acknowledge\u2014that damnable blunder of yours. Pooh!\u2014do you suppose I don't see through you?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nAnd even if that were true? If I perhaps guard my reputation somewhat anxiously, it is in the interests of the town. Without moral authority I am powerless to direct public affairs as seems, to my judgment, to be best for the common good. And on that account\u2014and for various other reasons too\u2014it appears to me to be a matter of importance that your report should not be delivered to the Committee. In the interests of the public, you must withhold it. Then, later on, I will raise the question and we will do our best, privately; but, nothing of this unfortunate affair not a single word of it\u2014must come to the ears of the public.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI am afraid you will not be able to prevent that now, my dear Peter.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nIt must and shall be prevented.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nIt is no use, I tell you. There are too many people that know about it.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nThat know about it? Who? Surely you don't mean those fellows on the \"People's Messenger\"?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes, they know. The liberal-minded independent press is going to see that you do your duty.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\n(after a short pause). You are an extraordinarily independent man, Thomas. Have you given no thought to the consequences this may have for yourself?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nConsequences?\u2014for me?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nFor you and yours, yes.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWhat the deuce do you mean?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nI believe I have always behaved in a brotherly way to you\u2014haven't I always been ready to oblige or to help you?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes, you have, and I am grateful to you for it.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nThere is no need. Indeed, to some extent I was forced to do so\u2014for my own sake. I always hoped that, if I helped to improve your financial position, I should be able to keep some check on you.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWhat! Then it was only for your own sake\u2014!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nUp to a certain point, yes. It is painful for a man in an official position to have his nearest relative compromising himself time after time.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nAnd do you consider that I do that?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nYes, unfortunately, you do, without even being aware of it. You have a restless, pugnacious, rebellious disposition. And then there is that disastrous propensity of yours to want to write about every sort of possible and impossible thing. The moment an idea comes into your head, you must needs go and write a newspaper article or a whole pamphlet about it.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWell, but is it not the duty of a citizen to let the public share in any new ideas he may have?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nOh, the public doesn't require any new ideas. The public is best served by the good, old established ideas it already has.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nAnd that is your honest opinion?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nYes, and for once I must talk frankly to you. Hitherto I have tried to avoid doing so, because I know how irritable you are; but now I must tell you the truth, Thomas. You have no conception what an amount of harm you do yourself by your impetuosity. You complain of the authorities, you even complain of the government\u2014you are always pulling them to pieces; you insist that you have been neglected and persecuted. But what else can such a cantankerous man as you expect?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWhat next! Cantankerous, am I?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nYes, Thomas, you are an extremely cantankerous man to work with\u2014I know that to my cost. You disregard everything that you ought to have consideration for. You seem completely to forget that it is me you have to thank for your appointment here as medical officer to the Baths.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI was entitled to it as a matter of course!\u2014I and nobody else! I was the first person to see that the town could be made into a flourishing watering-place, and I was the only one who saw it at that time. I had to fight single-handed in support of the idea for many years; and I wrote and wrote\u2014\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nUndoubtedly. But things were not ripe for the scheme then\u2014though, of course, you could not judge of that in your out-of-the-way corner up north. But as soon as the opportune moment came I\u2014and the others\u2014took the matter into our hands.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes, and made this mess of all my beautiful plan. It is pretty obvious now what clever fellows you were!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nTo my mind the whole thing only seems to mean that you are seeking another outlet for your combativeness. You want to pick a quarrel with your superiors\u2014an old habit of yours. You cannot put up with any authority over you. You look askance at anyone who occupies a superior official position; you regard him as a personal enemy, and then any stick is good enough to beat him with. But now I have called your attention to the fact that the town's interests are at stake\u2014and, incidentally, my own too. And therefore, I must tell you, Thomas, that you will find me inexorable with regard to what I am about to require you to do.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nAnd what is that?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nAs you have been so indiscreet as to speak of this delicate matter to outsiders, despite the fact that you ought to have treated it as entirely official and confidential, it is obviously impossible to hush it up now. All sorts of rumours will get about directly, and everybody who has a grudge against us will take care to embellish these rumours. So it will be necessary for you to refute them publicly.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI! How? I don't understand.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nWhat we shall expect is that, after making further investigations, you will come to the conclusion that the matter is not by any means as dangerous or as critical as you imagined in the first instance.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nOho!\u2014so that is what you expect!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nAnd, what is more, we shall expect you to make public profession of your confidence in the Committee and in their readiness to consider fully and conscientiously what steps may be necessary to remedy any possible defects.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nBut you will never be able to do that by patching and tinkering at it\u2014never! Take my word for it, Peter; I mean what I say, as deliberately and emphatically as possible.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nAs an officer under the Committee, you have no right to any individual opinion.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(amazed). No right?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nIn your official capacity, no. As a private person, it is quite another matter. But as a subordinate member of the staff of the Baths, you have no right to express any opinion which runs contrary to that of your superiors.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nThis is too much! I, a doctor, a man of science, have no right to\u2014!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nThe matter in hand is not simply a scientific one. It is a complicated matter, and has its economic as well as its technical side.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI don't care what it is! I intend to be free to express my opinion on any subject under the sun.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nAs you please\u2014but not on any subject concerning the Baths. That we forbid.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(shouting). You forbid\u2014! You! A pack of\u2014\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nI forbid it\u2014I, your chief; and if I forbid it, you have to obey.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(controlling himself). Peter\u2014if you were not my brother\u2014\n\nPETRA\n(throwing open the door). Father, you shan't stand this!\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\n(coming in after her). Petra, Petra!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nOh, so you have been eavesdropping.\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nYou were talking so loud, we couldn't help it!\n\nPETRA\nYes, I was listening.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nWell, after all, I am very glad\u2014\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(going up to him). You were saying something about forbidding and obeying?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nYou obliged me to take that tone with you.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nAnd so I am to give myself the lie, publicly?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nWe consider it absolutely necessary that you should make some such public statement as I have asked for.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nAnd if I do not\u2014obey?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nThen we shall publish a statement ourselves to reassure the public.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nVery well; but in that case I shall use my pen against you. I stick to what I have said; I will show that I am right and that you are wrong. And what will you do then?\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nThen I shall not be able to prevent your being dismissed.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nWhat\u2014?\n\nPETRA\nFather\u2014dismissed!\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nDismissed!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nDismissed from the staff of the Baths. I shall be obliged to propose that you shall immediately be given notice, and shall not be allowed any further participation in the Baths' affairs.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYou would dare to do that!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nIt is you that are playing the daring game.\n\nPETRA\nUncle, that is a shameful way to treat a man like father!\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nDo hold your tongue, Petra!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\n(looking at PETRA). Oh, so we volunteer our opinions already, do we? Of course. (To MRS. STOCKMANN.) Katherine, I imagine you are the most sensible person in this house. Use any influence you may have over your husband, and make him see what this will entail for his family as well as\u2014\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nMy family is my own concern and nobody else's!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\n\u2014for his own family, as I was saying, as well as for the town he lives in.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nIt is I who have the real good of the town at heart! I want to lay bare the defects that sooner or later must come to the light of day. I will show whether I love my native town.\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nYou, who in your blind obstinacy want to cut off the most important source of the town's welfare?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nThe source is poisoned, man! Are you mad? We are making our living by retailing filth and corruption! The whole of our flourishing municipal life derives its sustenance from a lie!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nAll imagination\u2014or something even worse. The man who can throw out such offensive insinuations about his native town must be an enemy to our community.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(going up to him). Do you dare to\u2014!\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\n(throwing herself between them). Thomas!\n\nPETRA\n(catching her father by the arm). Don't lose your temper, father!\n\nPETER STOCKMANN\nI will not expose myself to violence. Now you have had a warning; so reflect on what you owe to yourself and your family. Goodbye. (Goes out.)\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(walking up and down). Am I to put up with such treatment as this? In my own house, Katherine! What do you think of that!\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nIndeed it is both shameful and absurd, Thomas\u2014\n\nPETRA\nIf only I could give uncle a piece of my mind\u2014\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nIt is my own fault. I ought to have flown out at him long ago!\u2014shown my teeth!\u2014bitten! To hear him call me an enemy to our community! Me! I shall not take that lying down, upon my soul!\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nBut, dear Thomas, your brother has power on his side.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nYes, but I have right on mine, I tell you.\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nOh yes, right\u2014right. What is the use of having right on your side if you have not got might?\n\nPETRA\nOh, mother!\u2014how can you say such a thing!\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nDo you imagine that in a free country it is no use having right on your side? You are absurd, Katherine. Besides, haven't I got the liberal-minded, independent press to lead the way, and the compact majority behind me? That is might enough, I should think!\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nBut, good heavens, Thomas, you don't mean to?\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nDon't mean to what?\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nTo set yourself up in opposition to your brother.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nIn God's name, what else do you suppose I should do but take my stand on right and truth?\n\nPETRA\nYes, I was just going to say that.\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nBut it won't do you any earthly good. If they won't do it, they won't.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nOho, Katherine! Just give me time, and you will see how I will carry the war into their camp.\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nYes, you carry the war into their camp, and you get your dismissal\u2014that is what you will do.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nIn any case I shall have done my duty towards the public\u2014towards the community, I, who am called its enemy!\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nBut towards your family, Thomas? Towards your own home! Do you think that is doing your duty towards those you have to provide for?\n\nPETRA\nAh, don't think always first of us, mother.\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nOh, it is easy for you to talk; you are able to shift for yourself, if need be. But remember the boys, Thomas; and think a little of yourself too, and of me\u2014\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nI think you are out of your senses, Katherine! If I were to be such a miserable coward as to go on my knees to Peter and his damned crew, do you suppose I should ever know an hour's peace of mind all my life afterwards?\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nI don't know anything about that; but God preserve us from the peace of mind we shall have, all the same, if you go on defying him! You will find yourself again without the means of subsistence, with no income to count upon. I should think we had had enough of that in the old days. Remember that, Thomas; think what that means.\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(collecting himself with a struggle and clenching his fists). And this is what this slavery can bring upon a free, honourable man! Isn't it horrible, Katherine?\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\nYes, it is sinful to treat you so, it is perfectly true. But, good heavens, one has to put up with so much injustice in this world. There are the boys, Thomas! Look at them! What is to become of them? Oh, no, no, you can never have the heart\u2014. (EJLIF and MORTEN have come in, while she was speaking, with their school books in their hands.)\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\nThe boys\u2014 I (Recovers himself suddenly.) No, even if the whole world goes to pieces, I will never bow my neck to this yokel (Goes towards his room.)\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\n(following him). Thomas\u2014what are you going to do!\n\nDR. STOCKMANN\n(at his door). I mean to have the right to look my sons in the face when they are grown men. (Goes into his room.)\n\nMRS. STOCKMANN\n(bursting into tears). God help us all!\n\nPETRA\nFather is splendid! He will not give in.\n\n(The boys look on in amazement; PETRA signs to them not to speak.)Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/1563161", "artist_names": "Bob & Earl",

24 hours from Tulsa\nAh, only one day away from your arms\nI saw a welcoming light\nAnd stopped to rest for the night\nAnd that is when I saw her\nAs I pulled in outside of a small motel she was there\nAnd so I walked up to her\nAsked where I could get something to eat\nAnd she showed me where\n\nOh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa\nAh, only one day away from your arms\nShe took me to the cafe\nI asked her if she would stay\nShe said okay\n\nOh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa\nAh, only one day away from your arms\nThe jukebox started to play\nAnd nighttime turned into day\nAs we were dancing closely\nAll of a sudden I lost control as I held her charms\nAnd I caressed her, kissed her\nTold her I'd die before I let her out of my arms\n\nOh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa\nAh, only

sure looks different now\nWell I guess I look different too 'cause time changes everything\nI wonder what they'll say when they see their boy looking this way\nOh I wonder what they'll say when I get home\n\n[Verse 3]\nCan't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait\nAnd I'm still five hundred miles away from home\nIf my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight\nBut I'm
