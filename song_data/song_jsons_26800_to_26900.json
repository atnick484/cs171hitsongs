SOME OLD SCENES, AND SOME NEW PEOPLE\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Steerforth and I stayed for more than a fortnight in that part of the country. We were very much together, I need not say; but occasionally we were asunder for some hours at a time. He was a good sailor, and I was but an indifferent one; and when he went out boating with Mr. Peggotty, which was a favourite amusement of his, I generally remained ashore. My occupation of Peggotty's spare-room put a constraint upon me, from which he was free: for, knowing how assiduously she attended on Mr. Barkis all day, I did not like to remain out late at night; whereas Steerforth, lying at the Inn, had nothing to consult but his own humour. Thus it came about, that I heard of his making little treats for the fishermen at Mr. Peggotty's house of call, 'The Willing Mind', after I was in bed, and of his being afloat, wrapped in fishermen's clothes, whole moonlight nights, and coming back when the morning tide was at flood. By this time, however, I knew that his restless nature and bold spirits delighted to find a vent in rough toil and hard weather, as in any other means of excitement that presented itself freshly to him; so none of his proceedings surprised me.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another cause of our being sometimes apart, was, that I had naturally an interest in going over to Blunderstone, and revisiting the old familiar scenes of my childhood; while Steerforth, after being there once, had naturally no great interest in going there again. Hence, on three or four days that I can at once recall, we went our several ways after an early breakfast, and met again at a late dinner. I had no idea how he employed his time in the interval, beyond a general knowledge that he was very popular in the place, and had twenty means of actively diverting himself where another man might not have found one.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For my own part, my occupation in my solitary pilgrimages was to recall every yard of the old road as I went along it, and to haunt the old spots, of which I never tired. I haunted them, as my memory had often done, and lingered among them as my younger thoughts had lingered when I was far away. The grave beneath the tree, where both my parents lay\u2014on which I had looked out, when it was my father's only, with such curious feelings of compassion, and by which I had stood, so desolate, when it was opened to receive my pretty mother and her baby\u2014the grave which Peggotty's own faithful care had ever since kept neat, and made a garden of, I walked near, by the hour. It lay a little off the churchyard path, in a quiet corner, not so far removed but I could read the names upon the stone as I walked to and fro, startled by the sound of the church-bell when it struck the hour, for it was like a departed voice to me. My reflections at these times were always associated with the figure I was to make in life, and the distinguished things I was to do. My echoing footsteps went to no other tune, but were as constant to that as if I had come home to build my castles in the air at a living mother's side.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were great changes in my old home. The ragged nests, so long deserted by the rooks, were gone; and the trees were lopped and topped out of their remembered shapes. The garden had run wild, and half the windows of the house were shut up. It was occupied, but only by a poor lunatic gentleman, and the people who took care of him. He was always sitting at my little window, looking out into the churchyard; and I wondered whether his rambling thoughts ever went upon any of the fancies that used to occupy mine, on the rosy mornings when I peeped out of that same little window in my night-clothes, and saw the sheep quietly feeding in the light of the rising sun.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our old neighbours, Mr. and Mrs. Grayper, were gone to South America, and the rain had made its way through the roof of their empty house, and stained the outer walls. Mr. Chillip was married again to a tall, raw-boned, high-nosed wife; and they had a weazen little baby, with a heavy head that it couldn't hold up, and two weak staring eyes, with which it seemed to be always wondering why it had ever been born.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was with a singular jumble of sadness and pleasure that I used to linger about my native place, until the reddening winter sun admonished me that it was time to start on my returning walk. But, when the place was left behind, and especially when Steerforth and I were happily seated over our dinner by a blazing fire, it was delicious to think of having been there. So it was, though in a softened degree, when I went to my neat room at night; and, turning over the leaves of the crocodile-book (which was always there, upon a little table), remembered with a grateful heart how blest I was in having such a friend as Steerforth, such a friend as Peggotty, and such a substitute for what I had lost as my excellent and generous aunt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MY nearest way to Yarmouth, in coming back from these long walks, was by a ferry. It landed me on the flat between the town and the sea, which I could make straight across, and so save myself a considerable circuit by the high road. Mr. Peggotty's house being on that waste-place, and not a hundred yards out of my track, I always looked in as I went by. Steerforth was pretty sure to be there expecting me, and we went on together through the frosty air and gathering fog towards the twinkling lights of the town.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One dark evening, when I was later than usual\u2014for I had, that day, been making my parting visit to Blunderstone, as we were now about to return home\u2014I found him alone in Mr. Peggotty's house, sitting thoughtfully before the fire. He was so intent upon his own reflections that he was quite unconscious of my approach. This, indeed, he might easily have been if he had been less absorbed, for footsteps fell noiselessly on the sandy ground outside; but even my entrance failed to rouse him. I was standing close to him, looking at him; and still, with a heavy brow, he was lost in his meditations.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He gave such a start when I put my hand upon his shoulder, that he made me start too.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You come upon me,' he said, almost angrily, 'like a reproachful ghost!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I was obliged to announce myself, somehow,' I replied. 'Have I called you down from the stars?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No,' he answered. 'No.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Up from anywhere, then?' said I, taking my seat near him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I was looking at the pictures in the fire,' he returned.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'But you are spoiling them for me,' said I, as he stirred it quickly with a piece of burning wood, striking out of it a train of red-hot sparks that went careering up the little chimney, and roaring out into the air.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You would not have seen them,' he returned. 'I detest this mongrel time, neither day nor night. How late you are! Where have you been?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I have been taking leave of my usual walk,' said I.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'And I have been sitting here,' said Steerforth, glancing round the room, 'thinking that all the people we found so glad on the night of our coming down, might\u2014to judge from the present wasted air of the place\u2014be dispersed, or dead, or come to I don't know what harm. David, I wish to God I had had a judicious father these last twenty years!'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'My dear Steerforth, what is the matter?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I wish with all my soul I had been better guided!' he exclaimed. 'I wish with all my soul I could guide myself better!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a passionate dejection in his manner that quite amazed me. He was more unlike himself than I could have supposed possible.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It would be better to be this poor Peggotty, or his lout of a nephew,' he said, getting up and leaning moodily against the chimney-piece, with his face towards the fire, 'than to be myself, twenty times richer and twenty times wiser, and be the torment to myself that I have been, in this Devil's bark of a boat, within the last half-hour!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was so confounded by the alteration in him, that at first I could only observe him in silence, as he stood leaning his head upon his hand, and looking gloomily down at the fire. At length I begged him, with all the earnestness I felt, to tell me what had occurred to cross him so unusually, and to let me sympathize with him, if I could not hope to advise him. Before I had well concluded, he began to laugh\u2014fretfully at first, but soon with returning gaiety.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Tut, it's nothing, Daisy! nothing!' he replied. 'I told you at the inn in London, I am heavy company for myself, sometimes. I have been a nightmare to myself, just now\u2014must have had one, I think. At odd dull times, nursery tales come up into the memory, unrecognized for what they are. I believe I have been confounding myself with the bad boy who \"didn't care\", and became food for lions\u2014a grander kind of going to the dogs, I suppose. What old women call the horrors, have been creeping over me from head to foot. I have been afraid of myself.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You are afraid of nothing else, I think,' said I.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Perhaps not, and yet may have enough to be afraid of too,' he answered. 'Well! So it goes by! I am not about to be hipped again, David; but I tell you, my good fellow, once more, that it would have been well for me (and for more than me) if I had had a steadfast and judicious father!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His face was always full of expression, but I never saw it express such a dark kind of earnestness as when he said these words, with his glance bent on the fire.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'So much for that!' he said, making as if he tossed something light into the air, with his hand. \"'Why, being gone, I am a man again,\" like Macbeth. And now for dinner! If I have not (Macbeth-like) broken up the feast with most admired disorder, Daisy.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'But where are they all, I wonder!' said I.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'God knows,' said Steerforth. 'After strolling to the ferry looking for you, I strolled in here and found the place deserted. That set me thinking, and you found me thinking.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The advent of Mrs. Gummidge with a basket, explained how the house had happened to be empty. She had hurried out to buy something that was needed, against Mr. Peggotty's return with the tide; and had left the door open in the meanwhile, lest Ham and little Em'ly, with whom it was an early night, should come home while she was gone. Steerforth, after very much improving Mrs. Gummidge's spirits by a cheerful salutation and a jocose embrace, took my arm, and hurried me away.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had improved his own spirits, no less than Mrs. Gummidge's, for they were again at their usual flow, and he was full of vivacious conversation as we went along.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'And so,' he said, gaily, 'we abandon this buccaneer life tomorrow, do we?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'So we agreed,' I returned. 'And our places by the coach are taken, you know.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Ay! there's no help for it, I suppose,' said Steerforth. 'I have almost forgotten that there is anything to do in the world but to go out tossing on the sea here. I wish there was not.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'As long as the novelty should last,' said I, laughing.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Like enough,' he returned; 'though there's a sarcastic meaning in that observation for an amiable piece of innocence like my young friend. Well! I dare say I am a capricious fellow, David. I know I am; but while the iron is hot, I can strike it vigorously too. I could pass a reasonably good examination already, as a pilot in these waters, I think.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Mr. Peggotty says you are a wonder,' I returned.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'A nautical phenomenon, eh?' laughed Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Indeed he does, and you know how truly; I know how ardent you are in any pursuit you follow, and how easily you can master it. And that amazes me most in you, Steerforth\u2014that you should be contented with such fitful uses of your powers.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Contented?' he answered, merrily. 'I am never contented, except with your freshness, my gentle Daisy. As to fitfulness, I have never learnt the art of binding myself to any of the wheels on which the Ixions of these days are turning round and round. I missed it somehow in a bad apprenticeship, and now don't care about it.\u2014-You know I have bought a boat down here?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What an extraordinary fellow you are, Steerforth!' I exclaimed, stopping\u2014for this was the first I had heard of it. 'When you may never care to come near the place again!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I don't know that,' he returned. 'I have taken a fancy to the place. At all events,' walking me briskly on, 'I have bought a boat that was for sale\u2014a clipper, Mr. Peggotty says; and so she is\u2014and Mr. Peggotty will be master of her in my absence.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Now I understand you, Steerforth!' said I, exultingly. 'You pretend to have bought it for yourself, but you have really done so to confer a benefit on him. I might have known as much at first, knowing you. My dear kind Steerforth, how can I tell you what I think of your generosity?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Tush!' he answered, turning red. 'The less said, the better.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Didn't I know?' cried I, 'didn't I say that there was not a joy, or sorrow, or any emotion of such honest hearts that was indifferent to you?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Aye, aye,' he answered, 'you told me all that. There let it rest. We have said enough!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Afraid of offending him by pursuing the subject when he made so light of it, I only pursued it in my thoughts as we went on at even a quicker pace than before.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'She must be newly rigged,' said Steerforth, 'and I shall leave Littimer behind to see it done, that I may know she is quite complete. Did I tell you Littimer had come down?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh yes! came down this morning, with a letter from my mother.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As our looks met, I observed that he was pale even to his lips, though he looked very steadily at me. I feared that some difference between him and his mother might have led to his being in the frame of mind in which I had found him at the solitary fireside. I hinted so.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh no!' he said, shaking his head, and giving a slight laugh. 'Nothing of the sort! Yes. He is come down, that man of mine.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'The same as ever?' said I.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'The same as ever,' said Steerforth. 'Distant and quiet as the North Pole. He shall see to the boat being fresh named. She's the \"Stormy Petrel\" now. What does Mr. Peggotty care for Stormy Petrels! I'll have her christened again.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'By what name?' I asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'The \"Little Em'ly\".'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As he had continued to look steadily at me, I took it as a reminder that he objected to being extolled for his consideration. I could not help showing in my face how much it pleased me, but I said little, and he resumed his usual smile, and seemed relieved.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'But see here,' he said, looking before us, 'where the original little Em'ly comes! And that fellow with her, eh? Upon my soul, he's a true knight. He never leaves her!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ham was a boat-builder in these days, having improved a natural ingenuity in that handicraft, until he had become a skilled workman. He was in his working-dress, and looked rugged enough, but manly withal, and a very fit protector for the blooming little creature at his side. Indeed, there was a frankness in his face, an honesty, and an undisguised show of his pride in her, and his love for her, which were, to me, the best of good looks. I thought, as they came towards us, that they were well matched even in that particular.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to them, and blushed as she gave it to Steerforth and to me. When they passed on, after we had exchanged a few words, she did not like to replace that hand, but, still appearing timid and constrained, walked by herself. I thought all this very pretty and engaging, and Steerforth seemed to think so too, as we looked after them fading away in the light of a young moon.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly there passed us\u2014evidently following them\u2014a young woman whose approach we had not observed, but whose face I saw as she went by, and thought I had a faint remembrance of. She was lightly dressed; looked bold, and haggard, and flaunting, and poor; but seemed, for the time, to have given all that to the wind which was blowing, and to have nothing in her mind but going after them. As the dark distant level, absorbing their figures into itself, left but itself visible between us and the sea and clouds, her figure disappeared in like manner, still no nearer to them than before.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'That is a black shadow to be following the girl,' said Steerforth, standing still; 'what does it mean?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He spoke in a low voice that sounded almost strange to Me.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'She must have it in her mind to beg of them, I think,' said I.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'A beggar would be no novelty,' said Steerforth; 'but it is a strange thing that the beggar should take that shape tonight.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Why?' I asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'For no better reason, truly, than because I was thinking,' he said, after a pause, 'of something like it, when it came by. Where the Devil did it come from, I wonder!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'From the shadow of this wall, I think,' said I, as we emerged upon a road on which a wall abutted.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It's gone!' he returned, looking over his shoulder. 'And all ill go with it. Now for our dinner!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he looked again over his shoulder towards the sea-line glimmering afar off, and yet again. And he wondered about it, in some broken expressions, several times, in the short remainder of our walk; and only seemed to forget it when the light of fire and candle shone upon us, seated warm and merry, at table.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Littimer was there, and had his usual effect upon me. When I said to him that I hoped Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle were well, he answered respectfully (and of course respectably), that they were tolerably well, he thanked me, and had sent their compliments. This was all, and yet he seemed to me to say as plainly as a man could say: 'You are very young, sir; you are exceedingly young.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We had almost finished dinner, when taking a step or two towards the table, from the corner where he kept watch upon us, or rather upon me, as I felt, he said to his master:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I beg your pardon, sir. Miss Mowcher is down here.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Who?' cried Steerforth, much astonished.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Miss Mowcher, sir.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Why, what on earth does she do here?' said Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It appears to be her native part of the country, sir. She informs me that she makes one of her professional visits here, every year, sir. I met her in the street this afternoon, and she wished to know if she might have the honour of waiting on you after dinner, sir.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Do you know the Giantess in question, Daisy?' inquired Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was obliged to confess\u2014I felt ashamed, even of being at this disadvantage before Littimer\u2014that Miss Mowcher and I were wholly unacquainted.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Then you shall know her,' said Steerforth, 'for she is one of the seven wonders of the world. When Miss Mowcher comes, show her in.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt some curiosity and excitement about this lady, especially as Steerforth burst into a fit of laughing when I referred to her, and positively refused to answer any question of which I made her the subject. I remained, therefore, in a state of considerable expectation until the cloth had been removed some half an hour, and we were sitting over our decanter of wine before the fire, when the door opened, and Littimer, with his habitual serenity quite undisturbed, announced:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Miss Mowcher!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I looked at the doorway and saw nothing. I was still looking at the doorway, thinking that Miss Mowcher was a long while making her appearance, when, to my infinite astonishment, there came waddling round a sofa which stood between me and it, a pursy dwarf, of about forty or forty-five, with a very large head and face, a pair of roguish grey eyes, and such extremely little arms, that, to enable herself to lay a finger archly against her snub nose, as she ogled Steerforth, she was obliged to meet the finger half-way, and lay her nose against it. Her chin, which was what is called a double chin, was so fat that it entirely swallowed up the strings of her bonnet, bow and all. Throat she had none; waist she had none; legs she had none, worth mentioning; for though she was more than full-sized down to where her waist would have been, if she had had any, and though she terminated, as human beings generally do, in a pair of feet, she was so short that she stood at a common-sized chair as at a table, resting a bag she carried on the seat. This lady\u2014dressed in an off-hand, easy style; bringing her nose and her forefinger together, with the difficulty I have described; standing with her head necessarily on one side, and, with one of her sharp eyes shut up, making an uncommonly knowing face\u2014after ogling Steerforth for a few moments, broke into a torrent of words.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What! My flower!' she pleasantly began, shaking her large head at him. 'You're there, are you! Oh, you naughty boy, fie for shame, what do you do so far away from home? Up to mischief, I'll be bound. Oh, you're a downy fellow, Steerforth, so you are, and I'm another, ain't I? Ha, ha, ha! You'd have betted a hundred pound to five, now, that you wouldn't have seen me here, wouldn't you? Bless you, man alive, I'm everywhere. I'm here and there, and where not, like the conjurer's half-crown in the lady's handkercher. Talking of handkerchers\u2014and talking of ladies\u2014what a comfort you are to your blessed mother, ain't you, my dear boy, over one of my shoulders, and I don't say which!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miss Mowcher untied her bonnet, at this passage of her discourse, threw back the strings, and sat down, panting, on a footstool in front of the fire\u2014making a kind of arbour of the dining table, which spread its mahogany shelter above her head.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh my stars and what's-their-names!' she went on, clapping a hand on each of her little knees, and glancing shrewdly at me, 'I'm of too full a habit, that's the fact, Steerforth. After a flight of stairs, it gives me as much trouble to draw every breath I want, as if it was a bucket of water. If you saw me looking out of an upper window, you'd think I was a fine woman, wouldn't you?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I should think that, wherever I saw you,' replied Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Go along, you dog, do!' cried the little creature, making a whisk at him with the handkerchief with which she was wiping her face, 'and don't be impudent! But I give you my word and honour I was at Lady Mithers's last week\u2014THERE'S a woman! How SHE wears!\u2014and Mithers himself came into the room where I was waiting for her\u2014THERE'S a man! How HE wears! and his wig too, for he's had it these ten years\u2014and he went on at that rate in the complimentary line, that I began to think I should be obliged to ring the bell. Ha! ha! ha! He's a pleasant wretch, but he wants principle.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What were you doing for Lady Mithers?' asked Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'That's tellings, my blessed infant,' she retorted, tapping her nose again, screwing up her face, and twinkling her eyes like an imp of supernatural intelligence. 'Never YOU mind! You'd like to know whether I stop her hair from falling off, or dye it, or touch up her complexion, or improve her eyebrows, wouldn't you? And so you shall, my darling\u2014when I tell you! Do you know what my great grandfather's name was?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No,' said Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It was Walker, my sweet pet,' replied Miss Mowcher, 'and he came of a long line of Walkers, that I inherit all the Hookey estates from.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I never beheld anything approaching to Miss Mowcher's wink except Miss Mowcher's self-possession. She had a wonderful way too, when listening to what was said to her, or when waiting for an answer to what she had said herself, of pausing with her head cunningly on one side, and one eye turned up like a magpie's. Altogether I was lost in amazement, and sat staring at her, quite oblivious, I am afraid, of the laws of politeness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had by this time drawn the chair to her side, and was busily engaged in producing from the bag (plunging in her short arm to the shoulder, at every dive) a number of small bottles, sponges, combs, brushes, bits of flannel, little pairs of curling-irons, and other instruments, which she tumbled in a heap upon the chair. From this employment she suddenly desisted, and said to Steerforth, much to my confusion:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Who's your friend?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Mr. Copperfield,' said Steerforth; 'he wants to know you.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Well, then, he shall! I thought he looked as if he did!' returned Miss Mowcher, waddling up to me, bag in hand, and laughing on me as she came. 'Face like a peach!' standing on tiptoe to pinch my cheek as I sat. 'Quite tempting! I'm very fond of peaches. Happy to make your acquaintance, Mr. Copperfield, I'm sure.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I said that I congratulated myself on having the honour to make hers, and that the happiness was mutual.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh, my goodness, how polite we are!' exclaimed Miss Mowcher, making a preposterous attempt to cover her large face with her morsel of a hand. 'What a world of gammon and spinnage it is, though, ain't it!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was addressed confidentially to both of us, as the morsel of a hand came away from the face, and buried itself, arm and all, in the bag again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What do you mean, Miss Mowcher?' said Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Ha! ha! ha! What a refreshing set of humbugs we are, to be sure, ain't we, my sweet child?' replied that morsel of a woman, feeling in the bag with her head on one side and her eye in the air. 'Look here!' taking something out. 'Scraps of the Russian Prince's nails. Prince Alphabet turned topsy-turvy, I call him, for his name's got all the letters in it, higgledy-piggledy.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'The Russian Prince is a client of yours, is he?' said Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I believe you, my pet,' replied Miss Mowcher. 'I keep his nails in order for him. Twice a week! Fingers and toes.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'He pays well, I hope?' said Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Pays, as he speaks, my dear child\u2014through the nose,' replied Miss Mowcher. 'None of your close shavers the Prince ain't. You'd say so, if you saw his moustachios. Red by nature, black by art.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'By your art, of course,' said Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miss Mowcher winked assent. 'Forced to send for me. Couldn't help it. The climate affected his dye; it did very well in Russia, but it was no go here. You never saw such a rusty Prince in all your born days as he was. Like old iron!' 'Is that why you called him a humbug, just now?' inquired Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh, you're a broth of a boy, ain't you?' returned Miss Mowcher, shaking her head violently. 'I said, what a set of humbugs we were in general, and I showed you the scraps of the Prince's nails to prove it. The Prince's nails do more for me in private families of the genteel sort, than all my talents put together. I always carry 'em about. They're the best introduction. If Miss Mowcher cuts the Prince's nails, she must be all right. I give 'em away to the young ladies. They put 'em in albums, I believe. Ha! ha! ha! Upon my life, \"the whole social system\" (as the men call it when they make speeches in Parliament) is a system of Prince's nails!' said this least of women, trying to fold her short arms, and nodding her large head.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Steerforth laughed heartily, and I laughed too. Miss Mowcher continuing all the time to shake her head (which was very much on one side), and to look into the air with one eye, and to wink with the other.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Well, well!' she said, smiting her small knees, and rising, 'this is not business. Come, Steerforth, let's explore the polar regions, and have it over.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She then selected two or three of the little instruments, and a little bottle, and asked (to my surprise) if the table would bear. On Steerforth's replying in the affirmative, she pushed a chair against it, and begging the assistance of my hand, mounted up, pretty nimbly, to the top, as if it were a stage.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'If either of you saw my ankles,' she said, when she was safely elevated, 'say so, and I'll go home and destroy myself!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I did not,' said Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I did not,' said I.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Well then,' cried Miss Mowcher,' I'll consent to live. Now, ducky, ducky, ducky, come to Mrs. Bond and be killed.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was an invocation to Steerforth to place himself under her hands; who, accordingly, sat himself down, with his back to the table, and his laughing face towards me, and submitted his head to her inspection, evidently for no other purpose than our entertainment. To see Miss Mowcher standing over him, looking at his rich profusion of brown hair through a large round magnifying glass, which she took out of her pocket, was a most amazing spectacle.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You're a pretty fellow!' said Miss Mowcher, after a brief inspection. 'You'd be as bald as a friar on the top of your head in twelve months, but for me. Just half a minute, my young friend, and we'll give you a polishing that shall keep your curls on for the next ten years!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With this, she tilted some of the contents of the little bottle on to one of the little bits of flannel, and, again imparting some of the virtues of that preparation to one of the little brushes, began rubbing and scraping away with both on the crown of Steerforth's head in the busiest manner I ever witnessed, talking all the time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'There's Charley Pyegrave, the duke's son,' she said. 'You know Charley?' peeping round into his face.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'A little,' said Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What a man HE is! THERE'S a whisker! As to Charley's legs, if they were only a pair (which they ain't), they'd defy competition. Would you believe he tried to do without me\u2014in the Life-Guards, too?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Mad!' said Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It looks like it. However, mad or sane, he tried,' returned Miss Mowcher. 'What does he do, but, lo and behold you, he goes into a perfumer's shop, and wants to buy a bottle of the Madagascar Liquid.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Charley does?' said Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Charley does. But they haven't got any of the Madagascar Liquid.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What is it? Something to drink?' asked Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'To drink?' returned Miss Mowcher, stopping to slap his cheek. 'To doctor his own moustachios with, you know. There was a woman in the shop\u2014elderly female\u2014quite a Griffin\u2014who had never even heard of it by name. \"Begging pardon, sir,\" said the Griffin to Charley, \"it's not\u2014not\u2014not ROUGE, is it?\" \"Rouge,\" said Charley to the Griffin. \"What the unmentionable to ears polite, do you think I want with rouge?\" \"No offence, sir,\" said the Griffin; \"we have it asked for by so many names, I thought it might be.\" Now that, my child,' continued Miss Mowcher, rubbing all the time as busily as ever, 'is another instance of the refreshing humbug I was speaking of. I do something in that way myself\u2014perhaps a good deal\u2014perhaps a little\u2014sharp's the word, my dear boy\u2014never mind!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'In what way do you mean? In the rouge way?' said Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Put this and that together, my tender pupil,' returned the wary Mowcher, touching her nose, 'work it by the rule of Secrets in all trades, and the product will give you the desired result. I say I do a little in that way myself. One Dowager, SHE calls it lip-salve. Another, SHE calls it gloves. Another, SHE calls it tucker-edging. Another, SHE calls it a fan. I call it whatever THEY call it. I supply it for 'em, but we keep up the trick so, to one another, and make believe with such a face, that they'd as soon think of laying it on, before a whole drawing-room, as before me. And when I wait upon 'em, they'll say to me sometimes\u2014WITH IT ON\u2014thick, and no mistake\u2014\"How am I looking, Mowcher? Am I pale?\" Ha! ha! ha! ha! Isn't THAT refreshing, my young friend!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I never did in my days behold anything like Mowcher as she stood upon the dining table, intensely enjoying this refreshment, rubbing busily at Steerforth's head, and winking at me over it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Ah!' she said. 'Such things are not much in demand hereabouts. That sets me off again! I haven't seen a pretty woman since I've been here, jemmy.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No?' said Steerforth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Not the ghost of one,' replied Miss Mowcher.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'We could show her the substance of one, I think?' said Steerforth, addressing his eyes to mine. 'Eh, Daisy?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes, indeed,' said I.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Aha?' cried the little creature, glancing sharply at my face, and then peeping round at Steerforth's. 'Umph?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first exclamation sounded like a question put to both of us, and the second like a question put to Steerforth only. She seemed to have found no answer to either, but continued to rub, with her head on one side and her eye turned up, as if she were looking for an answer in the air and were confident of its appearing presently.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'A sister of yours, Mr. Copperfield?' she cried, after a pause, and still keeping the same look-out. 'Aye, aye?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No,' said Steerforth, before I could reply. 'Nothing of the sort. On the contrary, Mr. Copperfield used\u2014or I am much mistaken\u2014to have a great admiration for her.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Why, hasn't he now?' returned Miss Mowcher. 'Is he fickle? Oh, for shame! Did he sip every flower, and change every hour, until Polly his passion requited?\u2014Is her name Polly?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Elfin suddenness with which she pounced upon me with this question, and a searching look, quite disconcerted me for a moment.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No, Miss Mowcher,' I replied. 'Her name is Emily.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Aha?' she cried exactly as before. 'Umph? What a rattle I am! Mr. Copperfield, ain't I volatile?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her tone and look implied something that was not agreeable to me in connexion with the subject. So I said, in a graver manner than any of us had yet assumed: 'She is as virtuous as she is pretty. She is engaged to be married to a most worthy and deserving man in her own station of life. I esteem her for her good sense, as much as I admire her for her good looks.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Well said!' cried Steerforth. 'Hear, hear, hear! Now I'll quench the curiosity of this little Fatima, my dear Daisy, by leaving her nothing to guess at. She is at present apprenticed, Miss Mowcher, or articled, or whatever it may be, to Omer and Joram, Haberdashers, Milliners, and so forth, in this town. Do you observe? Omer and Joram. The promise of which my friend has spoken, is made and entered into with her cousin; Christian name, Ham; surname, Peggotty; occupation, boat-builder; also of this town. She lives with a relative; Christian name, unknown; surname, Peggotty; occupation, seafaring; also of this town. She is the prettiest and most engaging little fairy in the world. I admire her\u2014as my friend does\u2014exceedingly. If it were not that I might appear to disparage her Intended, which I know my friend would not like, I would add, that to me she seems to be throwing herself away; that I am sure she might do better; and that I swear she was born to be a lady.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miss Mowcher listened to these words, which were very slowly and distinctly spoken, with her head on one side, and her eye in the air as if she were still looking for that answer. When he ceased she became brisk again in an instant, and rattled away with surprising volubility.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh! And that's all about it, is it?' she exclaimed, trimming his whiskers with a little restless pair of scissors, that went glancing round his head in all directions. 'Very well: very well! Quite a long story. Ought to end \"and they lived happy ever afterwards\"; oughtn't it? Ah! What's that game at forfeits? I love my love with an E, because she's enticing; I hate her with an E, because she's engaged. I took her to the sign of the exquisite, and treated her with an elopement, her name's Emily, and she lives in the east? Ha! ha! ha! Mr. Copperfield, ain't I volatile?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Merely looking at me with extravagant slyness, and not waiting for any reply, she continued, without drawing breath:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'There! If ever any scapegrace was trimmed and touched up to perfection, you are, Steerforth. If I understand any noddle in the world, I understand yours. Do you hear me when I tell you that, my darling? I understand yours,' peeping down into his face. 'Now you may mizzle, jemmy (as we say at Court), and if Mr. Copperfield will take the chair I'll operate on him.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What do you say, Daisy?' inquired Steerforth, laughing, and resigning his seat. 'Will you be improved?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Thank you, Miss Mowcher, not this evening.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Don't say no,' returned the little woman, looking at me with the aspect of a connoisseur; 'a little bit more eyebrow?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Thank you,' I returned, 'some other time.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Have it carried half a quarter of an inch towards the temple,' said Miss Mowcher. 'We can do it in a fortnight.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No, I thank you. Not at present.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Go in for a tip,' she urged. 'No? Let's get the scaffolding up, then, for a pair of whiskers. Come!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could not help blushing as I declined, for I felt we were on my weak point, now. But Miss Mowcher, finding that I was not at present disposed for any decoration within the range of her art, and that I was, for the time being, proof against the blandishments of the small bottle which she held up before one eye to enforce her persuasions, said we would make a beginning on an early day, and requested the aid of my hand to descend from her elevated station. Thus assisted, she skipped down with much agility, and began to tie her double chin into her bonnet.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'The fee,' said Steerforth, 'is\u2014'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Five bob,' replied Miss Mowcher, 'and dirt cheap, my chicken. Ain't I volatile, Mr. Copperfield?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I replied politely: 'Not at all.' But I thought she was rather so, when she tossed up his two half-crowns like a goblin pieman, caught them, dropped them in her pocket, and gave it a loud slap.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'That's the Till!' observed Miss Mowcher, standing at the chair again, and replacing in the bag a miscellaneous collection of little objects she had emptied out of it. 'Have I got all my traps? It seems so. It won't do to be like long Ned Beadwood, when they took him to church \"to marry him to somebody\", as he says, and left the bride behind. Ha! ha! ha! A wicked rascal, Ned, but droll! Now, I know I'm going to break your hearts, but I am forced to leave you. You must call up all your fortitude, and try to bear it. Good-bye, Mr. Copperfield! Take care of yourself, jockey of Norfolk! How I have been rattling on! It's all the fault of you two wretches. I forgive you! \"Bob swore!\"\u2014as the Englishman said for \"Good night\", when he first learnt French, and thought it so like English. \"Bob swore,\" my ducks!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the bag slung over her arm, and rattling as she waddled away, she waddled to the door, where she stopped to inquire if she should leave us a lock of her hair. 'Ain't I volatile?' she added, as a commentary on this offer, and, with her finger on her nose, departed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Steerforth laughed to that degree, that it was impossible for me to help laughing too; though I am not sure I should have done so, but for this inducement. When we had had our laugh quite out, which was after some time, he told me that Miss Mowcher had quite an extensive connexion, and made herself useful to a variety of people in a variety of ways. Some people trifled with her as a mere oddity, he said; but she was as shrewdly and sharply observant as anyone he knew, and as long-headed as she was short-armed. He told me that what she had said of being here, and there, and everywhere, was true enough; for she made little darts into the provinces, and seemed to pick up customers everywhere, and to know everybody. I asked him what her disposition was: whether it was at all mischievous, and if her sympathies were generally on the right side of things: but, not succeeding in attracting his attention to these questions after two or three attempts, I forbore or forgot to repeat them. He told me instead, with much rapidity, a good deal about her skill, and her profits; and about her being a scientific cupper, if I should ever have occasion for her service in that capacity.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was the principal theme of our conversation during the evening: and when we parted for the night Steerforth called after me over the banisters, 'Bob swore!' as I went downstairs.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was surprised, when I came to Mr. Barkis's house, to find Ham walking up and down in front of it, and still more surprised to learn from him that little Em'ly was inside. I naturally inquired why he was not there too, instead of pacing the streets by himself?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Why, you see, Mas'r Davy,' he rejoined, in a hesitating manner, 'Em'ly, she's talking to some 'un in here.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I should have thought,' said I, smiling, 'that that was a reason for your being in here too, Ham.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Well, Mas'r Davy, in a general way, so 't would be,' he returned; 'but look'ee here, Mas'r Davy,' lowering his voice, and speaking very gravely. 'It's a young woman, sir\u2014a young woman, that Em'ly knowed once, and doen't ought to know no more.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I heard these words, a light began to fall upon the figure I had seen following them, some hours ago.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It's a poor wurem, Mas'r Davy,' said Ham, 'as is trod under foot by all the town. Up street and down street. The mowld o' the churchyard don't hold any that the folk shrink away from, more.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Did I see her tonight, Ham, on the sand, after we met you?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Keeping us in sight?' said Ham. 'It's like you did, Mas'r Davy. Not that I know'd then, she was theer, sir, but along of her creeping soon arterwards under Em'ly's little winder, when she see the light come, and whispering \"Em'ly, Em'ly, for Christ's sake, have a woman's heart towards me. I was once like you!\" Those was solemn words, Mas'r Davy, fur to hear!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'They were indeed, Ham. What did Em'ly do?' 'Says Em'ly, \"Martha, is it you? Oh, Martha, can it be you?\"\u2014for they had sat at work together, many a day, at Mr. Omer's.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I recollect her now!' cried I, recalling one of the two girls I had seen when I first went there. 'I recollect her quite well!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Martha Endell,' said Ham. 'Two or three year older than Em'ly, but was at the school with her.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I never heard her name,' said I. 'I didn't mean to interrupt you.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'For the matter o' that, Mas'r Davy,' replied Ham, 'all's told a'most in them words, \"Em'ly, Em'ly, for Christ's sake, have a woman's heart towards me. I was once like you!\" She wanted to speak to Em'ly. Em'ly couldn't speak to her theer, for her loving uncle was come home, and he wouldn't\u2014no, Mas'r Davy,' said Ham, with great earnestness, 'he couldn't, kind-natur'd, tender-hearted as he is, see them two together, side by side, for all the treasures that's wrecked in the sea.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt how true this was. I knew it, on the instant, quite as well as Ham.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'So Em'ly writes in pencil on a bit of paper,' he pursued, 'and gives it to her out o' winder to bring here. \"Show that,\" she says, \"to my aunt, Mrs. Barkis, and she'll set you down by her fire, for the love of me, till uncle is gone out, and I can come.\" By and by she tells me what I tell you, Mas'r Davy, and asks me to bring her. What can I do? She doen't ought to know any such, but I can't deny her, when the tears is on her face.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He put his hand into the breast of his shaggy jacket, and took out with great care a pretty little purse.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'And if I could deny her when the tears was on her face, Mas'r Davy,' said Ham, tenderly adjusting it on the rough palm of his hand, 'how could I deny her when she give me this to carry for her\u2014knowing what she brought it for? Such a toy as it is!' said Ham, thoughtfully looking on it. 'With such a little money in it, Em'ly my dear.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I shook him warmly by the hand when he had put it away again\u2014for that was more satisfactory to me than saying anything\u2014and we walked up and down, for a minute or two, in silence. The door opened then, and Peggotty appeared, beckoning to Ham to come in. I would have kept away, but she came after me, entreating me to come in too. Even then, I would have avoided the room where they all were, but for its being the neat-tiled kitchen I have mentioned more than once. The door opening immediately into it, I found myself among them before I considered whither I was going.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The girl\u2014the same I had seen upon the sands\u2014was near the fire. She was sitting on the ground, with her head and one arm lying on a chair. I fancied, from the disposition of her figure, that Em'ly had but newly risen from the chair, and that the forlorn head might perhaps have been lying on her lap. I saw but little of the girl's face, over which her hair fell loose and scattered, as if she had been disordering it with her own hands; but I saw that she was young, and of a fair complexion. Peggotty had been crying. So had little Em'ly. Not a word was spoken when we first went in; and the Dutch clock by the dresser seemed, in the silence, to tick twice as loud as usual. Em'ly spoke first.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Martha wants,' she said to Ham, 'to go to London.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Why to London?' returned Ham.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stood between them, looking on the prostrate girl with a mixture of compassion for her, and of jealousy of her holding any companionship with her whom he loved so well, which I have always remembered distinctly. They both spoke as if she were ill; in a soft, suppressed tone that was plainly heard, although it hardly rose above a whisper.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Better there than here,' said a third voice aloud\u2014Martha's, though she did not move. 'No one knows me there. Everybody knows me here.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What will she do there?' inquired Ham.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She lifted up her head, and looked darkly round at him for a moment; then laid it down again, and curved her right arm about her neck, as a woman in a fever, or in an agony of pain from a shot, might twist herself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'She will try to do well,' said little Em'ly. 'You don't know what she has said to us. Does he\u2014do they\u2014aunt?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peggotty shook her head compassionately.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I'll try,' said Martha, 'if you'll help me away. I never can do worse than I have done here. I may do better. Oh!' with a dreadful shiver, 'take me out of these streets, where the whole town knows me from a child!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Em'ly held out her hand to Ham, I saw him put in it a little canvas bag. She took it, as if she thought it were her purse, and made a step or two forward; but finding her mistake, came back to where he had retired near me, and showed it to him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It's all yourn, Em'ly,' I could hear him say. 'I haven't nowt in all the wureld that ain't yourn, my dear. It ain't of no delight to me, except for you!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tears rose freshly in her eyes, but she turned away and went to Martha. What she gave her, I don't know. I saw her stooping over her, and putting money in her bosom. She whispered something, as she asked was that enough? 'More than enough,' the other said, and took her hand and kissed it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then Martha arose, and gathering her shawl about her, covering her face with it, and weeping aloud, went slowly to the door. She stopped a moment before going out, as if she would have uttered something or turned back; but no word passed her lips. Making the same low, dreary, wretched moaning in her shawl, she went away.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the door closed, little Em'ly looked at us three in a hurried manner and then hid her face in her hands, and fell to sobbing.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Doen't, Em'ly!' said Ham, tapping her gently on the shoulder. 'Doen't, my dear! You doen't ought to cry so, pretty!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh, Ham!' she exclaimed, still weeping pitifully, 'I am not so good a girl as I ought to be! I know I have not the thankful heart, sometimes, I ought to have!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes, yes, you have, I'm sure,' said Ham.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No! no! no!' cried little Em'ly, sobbing, and shaking her head. 'I am not as good a girl as I ought to be. Not near! not near!' And still she cried, as if her heart would break.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I try your love too much. I know I do!' she sobbed. 'I'm often cross to you, and changeable with you, when I ought to be far different. You are never so to me. Why am I ever so to you, when I should think of nothing but how to be grateful, and to make you happy!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You always make me so,' said Ham, 'my dear! I am happy in the sight of you. I am happy, all day long, in the thoughts of you.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Ah! that's not enough!' she cried. 'That is because you are good; not because I am! Oh, my dear, it might have been a better fortune for you, if you had been fond of someone else\u2014of someone steadier and much worthier than me, who was all bound up in you, and never vain and changeable like me!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Poor little tender-heart,' said Ham, in a low voice. 'Martha has overset her, altogether.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Please, aunt,' sobbed Em'ly, 'come here, and let me lay my head upon you. Oh, I am very miserable tonight, aunt! Oh, I am not as good a girl as I ought to be. I am not, I know!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peggotty had hastened to the chair before the fire. Em'ly, with her arms around her neck, kneeled by her, looking up most earnestly into her face.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh, pray, aunt, try to help me! Ham, dear, try to help me! Mr. David, for the sake of old times, do, please, try to help me! I want to be a better girl than I am. I want to feel a hundred times more thankful than I do. I want to feel more, what a blessed thing it is to be the wife of a good man, and to lead a peaceful life. Oh me, oh me! Oh my heart, my heart!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She dropped her face on my old nurse's breast, and, ceasing this supplication, which in its agony and grief was half a woman's, half a child's, as all her manner was (being, in that, more natural, and better suited to her beauty, as I thought, than any other manner could have been), wept silently, while my old nurse hushed her like an infant.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She got calmer by degrees, and then we soothed her; now talking encouragingly, and now jesting a little with her, until she began to raise her head and speak to us. So we got on, until she was able to smile, and then to laugh, and then to sit up, half ashamed; while Peggotty recalled her stray ringlets, dried her eyes, and made her neat again, lest her uncle should wonder, when she got home, why his darling had been crying.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I saw her do, that night, what I had never seen her do before. I saw her innocently kiss her chosen husband on the cheek, and creep close to his bluff form as if it were her best support. When they went away together, in the waning moonlight, and I looked after them, comparing their departure in my mind with Martha's, I saw that she held his arm with both her hands, and still kept close to him.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1106078", "artist_names": "Dinah Washington", "full_title": "For All We Know by\u00a0Dinah\u00a0Washington", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/1dbca8a06ed142bf30c2b30c1d13a909.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/1dbca8a06ed142bf30c2b30c1d13a909.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 1106078, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429636707, "path": "/Dinah-washington-for-all-we-know-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Dinah-washington-for-all-we-know-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1962, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1962", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1962", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/1dbca8a06ed142bf30c2b30c1d13a909.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/1dbca8a06ed142bf30c2b30c1d13a909.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "For All We Know", "title_with_featured": "For All We Know", "updated_by_human_at": 1663770429, "url": "https://genius.com/Dinah-washington-for-all-we-know-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/49636", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/60e2487ad7e6921b06217451ed2873e3.561x561x1.jpg", "id": 49636, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/60e2487ad7e6921b06217451ed2873e3.561x561x1.jpg", "index_character": "d", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Dinah Washington", "slug": "Dinah-washington", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Dinah-washington"}, "artist": "Dinah Washington", "lyrics": "For All We Know LyricsFor all we know\nWe may never meet again\nBefore you go\nMake this moment sweet again\n\nWe won't say goodnight\nUntil the last minute\nI'll hold out my hand\nAnd my heart will be in it\n\nFor all we know\nThis may only be a dream\nWe come and we go\nLike the ripple on a stream\nSo love me, love me tonight\nTomorrow was made for some\nTomorrow may never come\nFor all we know, we know\n\nSo love me, love me tonight\nTomorrow was made for some\nTomorrow may never come\nFor all we know, we knowYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/494663", "artist_names": "Rolling Stone", "full_title": "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time by\u00a0Rolling\u00a0Stone", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/0fd143311476d3460782b97407cd8f47.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/0fd143311476d3460782b97407cd8f47.500x500x1.png", "id": 494663, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 21564, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1499623656, "path": "/Rolling-stone-the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-annotated", "pyongs_count": 13, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Rolling-stone-the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2004, "month": 12, "day": 9}, "release_date_for_display": "December 9, 2004", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Dec. 9, 2004", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/0fd143311476d3460782b97407cd8f47.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/0fd143311476d3460782b97407cd8f47.500x500x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 90395}, "title": "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time", "title_with_featured": "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time", "updated_by_human_at": 1585102754, "url": "https://genius.com/Rolling-stone-the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/69844", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/92dadbe1d0913a5ff55f8993ab6a3255.1000x525x1.jpg", "id": 69844, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e12ea098c2bbe9d5a0f48615c30519d4.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "r", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Rolling Stone", "slug": "Rolling-stone", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Rolling-stone"}, "artist": "Rolling Stone", "lyrics": "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time Lyrics1.

main, had to switch, never feign tho\nKeep that thang closed, need a raincoat\nShe contains notes, entertains, jokes\nWe had noticed, been drivin\u2019 all day 'cuz it's night time we just\nFocus, keep on lookin\u2019 at white lines as the\nMoment, passes throughout the bright sign, might climb\nWe just right now, hit up lights out\nSpeed through right out, right out\n'Cuz we was vibin' and we took a bad turn for the worst\nDispersin' these feelings and killin' it, killin' it worse (uh)\nSearchin' solutions but servin' the problems\nFightin\u2019 the promise, keepin\u2019 it honest\nI'm a just stop it, this is so common\n[Chorus: GV]\nMore feelings have been inflicting my pain\nBroke meaning I have to change up the game\nSlow healing from all the fake that you gave\nThe switch up, the switch up (yeah, aye)\nMore feelings have been inflicting my pain\nBroke meaning I have to change up the game\nSlow healing from all the fake that you gave\nThe switch up, the switch up, the switch up (woah)\n\n[Bridge: GV]\nThere\u2019s one thang, one way, I miss you, so come play\nNo games, need to say, ya lovin' sense, relieve the stress\n\n[Verse 2: GV]\nCome on baby, this tunnel feels like a mosh pit\nSome day we can channel our inner conscience\nAnd young fables can fail to mention the noxious\nWhat's true is if we can really be honest\nWhat's honest, the part that were takin\u2019 it over\nCaused problems, the part that we needed more closure\nNeed to be closer, I'm stoppin' the sad and the sorrow\nThe ending is never so holllow\nI'm takin' the damage and building a follow\nThe light that will hit us tomorrow\nYou might also like[Chorus: GV]\nMore feelings have been inflicting my pain\nBroke meaning I have to change up the game (woah)\nSlow healing from all the fake that you gave\nThe switch up, the switch up (yeah, aye)\nMore feelings have been inflicting my pain\nBroke meaning I have to change up the game\nSlow healing from all the fake that you gave\nThe switch up, the switch up, the switch up (woah)\n\n[Outro Part I: GV]\nThe switch up, woah, the switch up, woah\nThe switch up, yeah, the switch up, woah\n\n*Beat Switch*\n\n[Verse 3: Casey Masters]\nI never wanted to begin another endin'\nBut it's my time and I'm gonna rhyme every mention\nAbout the position I dealt within the lenses\nMy senses are tingling, 'cuz I here the ring\nTake a step in, start confessin'\nJugglin' much and I know that's a lie\nTakin' my time and I kill every rhyme\nKeep on denyin it knowin' I try\nI wanna see you do more than just cry\nWhy you be buggin' me, look in your eyes\nYou got em red but you don't fit the size (don't fit the size)\nManic inside\n[Bridge: Casey Masters]\nMore feelings (uh)\nBroke meaning (uh)\nSlow healing (uh)\nThe switch up (woah)\nMore feelings (uh)\nBroke meaning (uh)\nSlow healing (uh)\nThe switch up (woah\n\n[Chorus: Casey Masters]\nMore feelings have been inflicting my pain (woah)\nBroke meaning I have to change up the game

Ritter von Leopold Sacher-Masoch\n\nTranslator: Fernanda Savage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVENUS IN FURS\n\n\nOf this book, intended for\nprivate circulation, only\n1225 copies have been\nprinted, and type afterward\ndistributed.\n\n\n\n\nVENUS IN FURS\n\nBy\n\nLEOPOLD VON SACHER-MASOCH\n\n\nTranslated from the German\n\nBy\n\nFERNANDA SAVAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\"But the Almighty Lord hath struck him,\nand hath delivered him into the hands of\na woman.\"_\n\n--The Vulgate, Judith, xvi. 7.\n\n\nMy company was charming.\n\nOpposite me by the massive Renaissance fireplace sat Venus; she was not a casual woman of the half-world, who under this pseudonym wages war against the enemy sex, like Mademoiselle Cleopatra, but the real, true goddess of love.\n\nShe sat in an armchair and had kindled a crackling fire, whose\nreflection ran in red flames over her pale face with its white eyes, and from time to time over her feet when she sought to warm them.\n\nHer head was wonderful in spite of the dead stony eyes; it was all I could see of her. She had wrapped her marble-like body in a huge fur, and rolled herself up trembling like a cat.\n\n\"I don't understand it,\" I exclaimed, \"It isn't really cold any\nlonger. For two weeks past we have had perfect spring weather. You must be nervous.\"\n\"Much obliged for your spring,\" she replied with a low stony voice, and immediately afterwards sneezed divinely, twice in succession. \"I really can't stand it here much longer, and I am beginning to understand--\"\n\n\"What, dear lady?\"\n\n\"I am beginning to believe the unbelievable and to understand the un-understandable. All of a sudden I understand the Germanic virtue of woman, and German philosophy, and I am no longer surprised that you of the North do not know how to love, haven't even an idea of what love is.\"\n\n\"But, madame,\" I replied flaring up, \"I surely haven't given you any reason.\"\n\n\"Oh, you--\" The divinity sneezed for the third time, and shrugged her shoulders with inimitable grace. \"That's why I have always been nice to you, and even come to see you now and then, although I catch a cold every time, in spite of all my furs. Do you remember the first time we met?\"\n\n\"How could I forget it,\" I said. \"You wore your abundant hair in\nbrown curls, and you had brown eyes and a red mouth, but I recognized you immediately by the outline of your face and its marble-like pallor--you always wore a violet-blue velvet jacket edged with squirrel-skin.\"\n\n\"You were really in love with the costume, and awfully docile.\"\n\n\"You have taught me what love is. Your serene form of worship let me forget two thousand years.\"\n\n\"And my faithfulness to you was without equal!\"\n\n\"Well, as far as faithfulness goes--\"\n\n\"Ungrateful!\"\n\n\"I will not reproach you with anything. You are a divine woman, but nevertheless a woman, and like every woman cruel in love.\"\n\n\"What you call cruel,\" the goddess of love replied eagerly, \"is\nsimply the element of passion and of natural love, which is woman's nature and makes her give herself where she loves, and makes her love everything, that pleases her.\"\n\n\"Can there be any greater cruelty for a lover than the\nunfaithfulness of the woman he loves?\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" she replied. \"We are faithful as long as we love, but you demand faithfulness of a woman without love, and the giving of herself without enjoyment. Who is cruel there--woman or man? You of\nthe North in general take love too soberly and seriously. You talk\nof duties where there should be only a question of pleasure.\"\n\n\"That is why our emotions are honorable and virtuous, and our\nrelations permanent.\"\n\n\"And yet a restless, always unsatisfied craving for the nudity of\npaganism,\" she interrupted, \"but that love, which is the highest joy,\nwhich is divine simplicity itself, is not for you moderns, you\nchildren of reflection. It works only evil in you. _As soon as you\nwish to be natural, you become common._ To you nature seems something\nhostile; you have made devils out of the smiling gods of Greece, and\nout of me a demon. You can only exorcise and curse me, or slay\nyourselves in bacchantic madness before my altar. And if ever one of\nyou has had the courage to kiss my red mouth, he makes a barefoot\npilgrimage to Rome in penitential robes and expects flowers to grow\nfrom his withered staff, while under my feet roses, violets, and\nmyrtles spring up every hour, but their fragrance does not agree with\nyou. Stay among your northern fogs and Christian incense; let us\npagans remain under the debris, beneath the lava; do not disinter us.\nPompeii was not built for you, nor our villas, our baths, our temples.\nYou do not require gods. We are chilled in your world.\"\n\nThe beautiful marble woman coughed, and drew the dark sables still\ncloser about her shoulders.\n\n\"Much obliged for the classical lesson,\" I replied, \"but you cannot\ndeny, that man and woman are mortal enemies, in your serene sunlit\nworld as well as in our foggy one. In love there is union into a\nsingle being for a short time only, capable of only one thought, one\nsensation, one will, in order to be then further disunited. And you\nknow this better than I; whichever of the two fails to subjugate will\nsoon feel the feet of the other on his neck--\"\n\n\"And as a rule the man that of the woman,\" cried Madame Venus with\nproud mockery, \"which you know better than I.\"\n\n\"Of course, and that is why I don't have any illusions.\"\n\n\"You mean you are now my slave without illusions, and for that\nreason you shall feel the weight of my foot without mercy.\"\n\n\"Madame!\"\n\n\"Don't you know me yet? Yes, I am _cruel_--since you take so much\ndelight in that word-and am I not entitled to be so? Man is the one\nwho desires, woman the one who is desired. This is woman's entire but\ndecisive advantage. Through his passion nature has given man into\nwoman's hands, and the woman who does not know how to make him her\nsubject, her slave, her toy, and how to betray him with a smile in the\nend is not wise.\"\n\n\"Exactly your principles,\" I interrupted angrily.\n\n\"They are based on the experience of thousands of years,\" she\nreplied ironically, while her white fingers played over the dark fur.\n\"The more devoted a woman shows herself, the sooner the man sobers\ndown and becomes domineering. The more cruelly she treats him and the\nmore faithless she is, the worse she uses him, the more wantonly she\nplays with him, the less pity she shows him, by so much the more will\nshe increase his desire, be loved, worshipped by him. So it has\nalways been, since the time of Helen and Delilah, down to Catherine\nthe Second and Lola Montez.\"\n\n\"I cannot deny,\" I said, \"that nothing will attract a man more than\nthe picture of a beautiful, passionate, cruel, and despotic woman who\nwantonly changes her favorites without scruple in accordance with her\nwhim--\"\n\n\"And in addition wears furs,\" exclaimed the divinity.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I know your predilection.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" I interrupted, \"that, since we last saw each other,\nyou have grown very coquettish.\"\n\n\"In what way, may I ask?\"\n\n\"In that there is no way of accentuating your white body to greater\nadvantage than by these dark furs, and that--\"\n\nThe divinity laughed.\n\n\"You are dreaming,\" she cried, \"wake up!\" and she clasped my arm\nwith her marble-white hand. \"Do wake up,\" she repeated raucously with\nthe low register of her voice. I opened my eyes with difficulty.\n\nI saw the hand which shook me, and suddenly it was brown as bronze;\nthe voice was the thick alcoholic voice of my cossack servant who\nstood before me at his full height of nearly six feet.\n\n\"Do get up,\" continued the good fellow, \"it is really disgraceful.\"\n\n\"What is disgraceful?\"\n\n\"To fall asleep in your clothes and with a book besides.\" He snuffed\nthe candles which had burned down, and picked up the volume which had\nfallen from my hand, \"with a book by\"--he looked at the title page--\n\"by Hegel. Besides it is high time you were starting for Mr.\nSeverin's who is expecting us for tea.\"\n\n\"A curious dream,\" said Severin when I had finished. He supported\nhis arms on his knees, resting his face in his delicate, finely\nveined hands, and fell to pondering.\n\nI knew that he wouldn't move for a long time, hardly even breathe. This\nactually happened, but I didn't consider his behavior as in any way\nremarkable. I had been on terms of close friendship with him for nearly\nthree years, and gotten used to his peculiarities. For it cannot be\ndenied that he was peculiar, although he wasn't quite the dangerous\nmadman that the neighborhood, or indeed the entire district of Kolomea,\nconsidered him to be. I found his personality not only interesting--and\nthat is why many also regarded me a bit mad--but to a degree\nsympathetic. For a Galician nobleman and land-owner, and considering his\nage--he was hardly over thirty--he displayed surprising sobriety, a\ncertain seriousness, even pedantry. He lived according to a minutely\nelaborated, half-philosophical, half-practical system, like clock-work;\nnot this alone, but also by the thermometer, barometer, aerometer,\nhydrometer, Hippocrates, Hufeland, Plato, Kant, Knigge, and Lord\nChesterfield. But at times he had violent attacks of sudden passion, and\ngave the impression of being about to run with his head right through a\nwall. At such times every one preferred to get out of his way.\n\nWhile he remained silent, the fire sang in the chimney and the large\nvenerable samovar sang; and the ancient chair in which I sat rocking\nto and fro smoking my cigar, and the cricket in the old walls sang\ntoo. I let my eyes glide over the curious apparatus, skeletons of\nanimals, stuffed birds, globes, plaster-casts, with which his room\nwas heaped full, until by chance my glance remained fixed on a\npicture which I had seen often enough before. But to-day, under the\nreflected red glow of the fire, it made an indescribable impression\non me.\n\nIt was a large oil painting, done in the robust full-bodied manner\nof the Belgian school. Its subject was strange enough.\n\nA beautiful woman with a radiant smile upon her face, with abundant\nhair tied into a classical knot, on which white powder lay like a\nsoft hoarfrost, was resting on an ottoman, supported on her left arm.\nShe was nude in her dark furs. Her right hand played with a lash,\nwhile her bare foot rested carelessly on a man, lying before her like\na slave, like a dog. In the sharply outlined, but well-formed\nlinaments of this man lay brooding melancholy and passionate\ndevotion; he looked up to her with the ecstatic burning eye of a\nmartyr. This man, the footstool for her feet, was Severin, but\nbeardless, and, it seemed, some ten years younger.\n\n\"_Venus in Furs_,\" I cried, pointing to the picture. \"That is the way\nI saw her in my dream.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" said Severin, \"only I dreamed my dream with open eyes.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"It is a tiresome story.\"\n\n\"Your picture apparently suggested my dream,\" I continued. \"But do\ntell me what it means. I can imagine that it played a role in your\nlife, and perhaps a very decisive one. But the details I can only get\nfrom you.\"\n\n\"Look at its counterpart,\" replied my strange friend, without\nheeding my question.\n\nThe counterpart was an excellent copy of Titian's well-known \"Venus\nwith the Mirror\" in the Dresden Gallery.\n\n\"And what is the significance?\"\n\nSeverin rose and pointed with his finger at the fur with which\nTitian garbed his goddess of love.\n\n\"It, too, is a 'Venus in Furs,'\" he said with a slight smile. \"I\ndon't believe that the old Venetian had any secondary intention. He\nsimply painted the portrait of some aristocratic Mesalina, and was\ntactful enough to let Cupid hold the mirror in which she tests her\nmajestic allure with cold satisfaction. He looks as though his task\nwere becoming burdensome enough. The picture is painted flattery.\nLater an 'expert' in the Rococo period baptized the lady with the\nname of Venus. The furs of the despot in which Titian's fair model\nwrapped herself, probably more for fear of a cold than out of\nmodesty, have become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty that\nconstitute woman's essence and her beauty.\n\n\"But enough of that. The picture, as it now exists, is a bitter\nsatire on our love. Venus in this abstract North, in this icy\nChristian world, has to creep into huge black furs so as not to catch\ncold--\"\n\nSeverin laughed, and lighted a fresh cigarette.\n\nJust then the door opened and an attractive, stoutish, blonde girl\nentered. She had wise, kindly eyes, was dressed in black silk, and\nbrought us cold meat and eggs with our tea. Severin took one of the\nlatter, and decapitated it with his knife.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you that I want them soft-boiled?\" he cried with a\nviolence that made the young woman tremble.\n\n\"But my dear Sevtchu--\" she said timidly.\n\n\"Sevtchu, nothing,\" he yelled, \"you are to obey, obey, do you\nunderstand?\" and he tore the _kantchuk_ [Footnote: A long whip with a\nshort handle.] which was hanging beside the weapons from its hook.\n\nThe woman fled from the chamber quickly and timidly like a doe.\n\n\"Just wait, I'll get you yet,\" he called after her.\n\n\"But Severin,\" I said placing my hand on his arm, \"how can you treat\na pretty young woman thus?\"\n\n\"Look at the woman,\" he replied, blinking humorously with his eyes.\n\"Had I flattered her, she would have cast the noose around my neck,\nbut now, when I bring her up with the _kantchuk_, she adores me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, nothing, that is the way you have to break in women.\"\n\n\"Well, if you like it, live like a pasha in your harem, but don't\nlay down theories for me--\"\n\n\"Why not,\" he said animatedly. \"Goethe's 'you must be hammer or anvil'\nis absolutely appropriate to the relation between man and woman.\nDidn't Lady Venus in your dream prove that to you? Woman's power lies\nin man's passion, and she knows how to use it, if man doesn't\nunderstand himself. He has only one choice: to be the _tyrant_ over or\nthe _slave_ of woman. As soon as he gives in, his neck is under the\nyoke, and the lash will soon fall upon him.\"\n\n\"Strange maxims!\"\n\n\"Not maxims, but experiences,\" he replied, nodding his head, \"_I have\nactually felt the lash_. I am cured. Do you care to know how?\"\n\nHe rose, and got a small manuscript from his massive desk, and put\nit in front of me.\n\n\"You have already asked about the picture. I have long owed you an\nexplanation. Here--read!\"\n\nSeverin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me, and seemed\nto dream with open eyes. Silence had fallen again, and again the fire\nsang in the chimney, and the samovar and the cricket in the old\nwalls. I opened the manuscript and read:\n\nCONFESSIONS OF A SUPERSENSUAL MAN.\n\nThe margin of the manuscript bore as motto a variation of the well-known\nlines from _Faust_:\n\n\"Thou supersensual sensual wooer\nA woman leads you by the nose.\"\n--MEPHISTOPHELES.\n\nI turned the title-page and read: \"What follows has been compiled\nfrom my diary of that period, because it is impossible ever frankly\nto write of one's past, but in this way everything retains its fresh\ncolors, the colors of the present.\"\n\nGogol, the Russian Moliere, says--where? well, somewhere--\"the real\ncomic muse is the one under whose laughing mask tears roll down.\"\n\nA wonderful saying.\n\nSo I have a very curious feeling as I am writing all this down. The\natmosphere seems filled with a stimulating fragrance of flowers,\nwhich overcomes me and gives me a headache. The smoke of the\nfireplace curls and condenses into figures, small gray-bearded\nkokolds that mockingly point their finger at me. Chubby-cheeked\ncupids ride on the arms of my chair and on my knees. I have to smile\ninvoluntarily, even laugh aloud, as I am writing down my adventures.\nYet I am not writing with ordinary ink, but with red blood that drips\nfrom my heart. All its wounds long scarred over have opened and it\nthrobs and hurts, and now and then a tear falls on the paper.\n\nThe days creep along sluggishly in the little Carpathian health-resort.\nYou see no one, and no one sees you. It is boring enough to write idyls.\nI would have leisure here to supply a whole gallery of paintings,\nfurnish a theater with new pieces for an entire season, a dozen\nvirtuosos with concertos, trios, and duos, but--what am I saying--the\nupshot of it all is that I don't do much more than to stretch the\ncanvas, smooth the bow, line the scores. For I am--no false modesty,\nFriend Severin; you can lie to others, but you don't quite succeed any\nlonger in lying to yourself--I am nothing but a dilettante, a dilettante\nin painting, in poetry, in music, and several other of the so-called\nunprofitable arts, which, however, at present secure for their masters\nthe income of a cabinet minister, or even that of a minor potentate.\nAbove all else I am a dilettante in life.\n\nUp to the present I have lived as I have painted and written poetry.\nI never got far beyond the preparation, the plan, the first act, the\nfirst stanza. There are people like that who begin everything, and\nnever finish anything. I am such a one.\n\nBut what am I saying?\n\nTo the business in hand.\n\nI lie in my window, and the miserable little town, which fills me\nwith despondency, really seems infinitely full of poetry. How\nwonderful the outlook upon the blue wall of high mountains interwoven\nwith golden sunlight; mountain-torrents weave through them like\nribbons of silver! How clear and blue the heavens into which\nsnowcapped crags project; how green and fresh the forested slopes;\nthe meadows on which small herds graze, down to the yellow billows\nof grain where reapers stand and bend over and rise up again.\n\nThe house in which I live stands in a sort of park, or forest, or\nwilderness, whatever one wants to call it, and is very solitary.\n\nIts sole inhabitants are myself, a widow from Lemberg, and Madame\nTartakovska, who runs the house, a little old woman, who grows older\nand smaller each day. There are also an old dog that limps on one\nleg, and a young cat that continually plays with a ball of yarn. This\nball of yarn, I believe, belongs to the widow.\n\nShe is said to be really beautiful, this widow, still very young,\ntwenty-four at the most, and very rich. She dwells in the first story,\nand I on the ground floor. She always keeps the green blinds drawn, and\nhas a balcony entirely overgrown with green climbing-plants. I for my\npart down below have a comfortable, intimate arbor of honeysuckle, in\nwhich I read and write and paint and sing like a bird among the twigs. I\ncan look up on the balcony. Sometimes I actually do so, and then from\ntime to time a white gown gleams between the dense green network.\n\nReally the beautiful woman up there doesn't interest me very much, for I\nam in love with someone else, and terribly unhappy at that; far more\nunhappy than the Knight of Toggenburg or the Chevalier in Manon\nl'Escault, because the object of my adoration is of stone.\n\nIn the garden, in the tiny wilderness, there is a graceful little\nmeadow on which a couple of deer graze peacefully. On this meadow is\na stone statue of Venus, the original of which, I believe, is in\nFlorence. This Venus is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in\nall my life.\n\nThat, however, does not signify much, for I have seen few beautiful\nwomen, or rather few women at all. In love too, I am a dilettante who\nnever got beyond the preparation, the first act.\n\nBut why talk in superlatives, as if something that is beautiful\ncould be surpassed?\n\nIt is sufficient to say that this Venus is beautiful. I love her\npassionately with a morbid intensity; madly as one can only love a\nwoman who never responds to our love with anything but an eternally\nuniform, eternally calm, stony smile. I literally adore her.\n\nI often lie reading under the leafy covering of a young birch when\nthe sun broods over the forest. Often I visit that cold, cruel\nmistress of mine by night and lie on my knees before her, with the\nface pressed against the cold pedestal on which her feet rest, and\nmy prayers go up to her.\n\nThe rising moon, which just now is waning, produces an indescribable\neffect. It seems to hover among the trees and submerges the meadow\nin its gleam of silver. The goddess stands as if transfigured, and\nseems to bathe in the soft moonlight.\n\nOnce when I was returning from my devotions by one of the walks\nleading to the house, I suddenly saw a woman's figure, white as\nstone, under the illumination of the moon and separated from me\nmerely by a screen of trees. It seemed as if the beautiful woman of\nmarble had taken pity on me, become alive, and followed me. I was\nseized by a nameless fear, my heart threatened to burst, and instead--\n\nWell, I am a dilettante. As always, I broke down at the second\nstanza; rather, on the contrary, I did not break down, but ran away\nas fast as my legs would carry me.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat an accident! Through a Jew, dealing in photographs I secured a\npicture of my ideal. It is a small reproduction of Titian's \"Venus\nwith the Mirror.\" What a woman! I want to write a poem, but instead,\nI take the reproduction, and write on it: _Venus in Furs_.\n\nYou are cold, while you yourself fan flames. By all means wrap\nyourself in your despotic furs, there is no one to whom they are more\nappropriate, cruel goddess of love and of beauty!--After a while I add\na few verses from Goethe, which I recently found in his paralipomena\nto _Faust_.\n\nTO AMOR\n\n\"The pair of wings a fiction are,\nThe arrows, they are naught but claws,\nThe wreath conceals the little horns,\nFor without any doubt he is\nLike all the gods of ancient Greece\nOnly a devil in disguise.\"\n\nThen I put the picture before me on my table, supporting it with a\nbook, and looked at it.\n\nI was enraptured and at the same time filled with a strange fear by\nthe cold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charms\nin her furs of dark sable; by the severity and hardness which lay in\nthis cold marble-like face. Again I took my pen in hand, and wrote\nthe following words:\n\n\"To love, to be loved, what happiness! And yet how the glamour of\nthis pales in comparison with the tormenting bliss of worshipping a\nwoman who makes a plaything out of us, of being the slave of a\nbeautiful tyrant who treads us pitilessly underfoot. Even Samson, the\nhero, the giant, again put himself into the hands of Delilah, even\nafter she had betrayed him, and again she betrayed him, and the\nPhilistines bound him and put out his eyes which until the very end\nhe kept fixed, drunken with rage and love, upon the beautiful\nbetrayer.\"\n\nI was breakfasting in my honey-suckle arbor, and reading in the Book\nof Judith. I envied the hero Holofernes because of the regal woman\nwho cut off his head with a sword, and because of his beautiful\nsanguinary end.\n\n\"The almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the\nhands of a woman.\"\n\nThis sentence strangely impressed me.\n\nHow ungallant these Jews are, I thought. And their God might choose\nmore becoming expressions when he speaks of the fair sex.\n\n\"The almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the\nhands of a woman,\" I repeated to myself. What shall I do, so that He\nmay punish me?\n\nHeaven preserve us! Here comes the housekeeper, who has again\ndiminished somewhat in size overnight. And up there among the green\ntwinings and garlandings the white gown gleams again. Is it Venus,\nor the widow?\n\nThis time it happens to be the widow, for Madame Tartakovska makes\na courtesy, and asks me in her name for something to read. I run to\nmy room, and gather together a couple of volumes.\n\nLater I remember that my picture of Venus is in one of them, and now\nit and my effusions are in the hands of the white woman up there\ntogether. What will she say?\n\nI hear her laugh.\n\nIs she laughing at me?\n\nIt is full moon. It is already peering over the tops of the low\nhemlocks that fringe the park. A silvery exhalation fills the\nterrace, the groups of trees, all the landscape, as far as the eye\ncan reach; in the distance it gradually fades away, like trembling\nwaters.\n\nI cannot resist. I feel a strange urge and call within me. I put on\nmy clothes again and go out into the garden.\n\nSome power draws me toward the meadow, toward her, who is my\ndivinity and my beloved.\n\nThe night is cool. I feel a slight chill. The atmosphere is heavy\nwith the odor of flowers and of the forest. It intoxicates.\n\nWhat solemnity! What music round about! A nightingale sobs. The\nstars quiver very faintly in the pale-blue glamour. The meadow seems\nsmooth, like a mirror, like a covering of ice on a pond.\n\nThe statue of Venus stands out august and luminous.\n\nBut--what has happened? From the marble shoulders of the goddess a\nlarge dark fur flows down to her heels. I stand dumbfounded and stare\nat her in amazement; again an indescribable fear seizes hold of me\nand I take flight.\n\nI hasten my steps, and notice that I have missed the main path. As\nI am about to turn aside into one of the green walks I see Venus\nsitting before me on a stone bench, not the beautiful woman of\nmarble, but the goddess of love herself with warm blood and throbbing\npulses. She has actually come to life for me, like the statue that\nbegan to breathe for her creator. Indeed, the miracle is only half\ncompleted. Her white hair seems still to be of stone, and her white\ngown shimmers like moonlight, or is it satin? From her shoulders the\ndark fur flows. But her lips are already reddening and her cheeks\nbegin to take color. Two diabolical green rays out of her eyes fall\nupon me, and now she laughs.\n\nHer laughter is very mysterious, very--I don't know. It cannot be\ndescribed, it takes my breath away. I flee further, and after every\nfew steps I have to pause to take breath. The mocking laughter\npursues me through the dark leafy paths, across light open spaces,\nthrough the thicket where only single moonbeams can pierce. I can no\nlonger find my way, I wander about utterly confused, with cold drops\nof perspiration on the forehead.\n\nFinally I stand still, and engage in a short monologue.\n\nIt runs--well--one is either very polite to one's self or very rude.\n\nI say to myself:\n\n\"Donkey!\"\n\nThis word exercises a remarkable effect, like a magic formula, which\nsets me free and makes me master of myself.\n\nI am perfectly quiet in a moment.\n\nWith considerable pleasure I repeat: \"Donkey!\"\n\nNow everything is perfectly clear and distinct before my eyes again.\nThere is the fountain, there the alley of box-wood, there the house\nwhich I am slowly approaching.\n\nYet--suddenly the appearance is here again. Behind the green screen\nthrough which the moonlight gleams so that it seems embroidered with\nsilver, I again see the white figure, the woman of stone whom I\nadore, whom I fear and flee.\n\nWith a couple of leaps I am within the house and catch my breath and\nreflect.\n\nWhat am I really, a little dilettante or a great big donkey?\n\nA sultry morning, the atmosphere is dead, heavily laden with odors,\nyet stimulating. Again I am sitting in my honey-suckle arbor, reading\nin the Odyssey about the beautiful witch who transformed her admirers\ninto beasts. A wonderful picture of antique love.\n\nThere is a soft rustling in the twigs and blades and the pages of my\nbook rustle and on the terrace likewise there is a rustling.\n\nA woman's dress--\n\nShe is there--Venus--but without furs--No, this time it is merely\nthe widow--and yet--Venus-oh, what a woman!\n\nAs she stands there in her light white morning gown, looking at me, her\nslight figure seems full of poetry and grace. She is neither large, nor\nsmall; her head is alluring, piquant--in the sense of the period of the\nFrench marquises--rather than formally beautiful. What enchantment and\nsoftness, what roguish charm play about her none too small mouth! Her\nskin is so infinitely delicate, that the blue veins show through\neverywhere; even through the muslin covering her arms and bosom. How\nabundant her red hair-it is red, not blonde or golden-yellow--how\ndiabolically and yet tenderly it plays around her neck! Now her eyes\nmeet mine like green lightnings--they are green, these eyes of hers,\nwhose power is so indescribable--green, but as are precious stones, or\ndeep unfathomable mountain lakes.\n\nShe observes my confusion, which has even made me discourteous, for I\nhave remained seated and still have my cap on my head.\n\nShe smiles roguishly.\n\nFinally I rise and bow to her. She comes closer, and bursts out into\na loud, almost childlike laughter. I stammer, as only a little\ndilettante or great big donkey can do on such an occasion.\n\nThus our acquaintance began.\n\nThe divinity asks for my name, and mentions her own.\n\nHer name is Wanda von Dunajew.\n\nAnd she is actually my Venus.\n\n\"But madame, what put the idea into your head?\"\n\n\"The little picture in one of your books--\"\n\n\"I had forgotten about it.\"\n\n\"The curious notes on its back--\"\n\n\"Why curious?\"\n\nShe looked at me.\n\n\"I have always wanted to know a real dreamer some time--for the sake\nof the change--and you seem one of the maddest of the tribe.\"\n\n\"Dear lady--in fact--\" Again I fell victim to an odious, asinine\nstammering, and in addition blushed in a way that might have been\nappropriate for a youngster of sixteen, but not for me, who was\nalmost a full ten years older--\n\n\"You were afraid of me last night.\"\n\n\"Really--of course--but won't you sit down?\"\n\nShe sat down, and enjoyed my embarrassment--for actually I was even\nmore afraid of her now in the full light of day. A delightful\nexpression of contempt hovered about her upper lip.\n\n\"You look at love, and especially woman,\" she began, \"as something\nhostile, something against which you put up a defense, even if\nunsuccessfully. You feel that their power over you gives you a\nsensation of pleasurable torture, of pungent cruelty. This is a\ngenuinely modern point of view.\"\n\n\"You don't share it?\"\n\n\"I do not share it,\" she said quickly and decisively, shaking her\nhead, so that her curls flew up like red flames.\n\n\"The ideal which I strive to realize in my life is the serene\nsensuousness of the Greeks--pleasure without pain. I do not believe\nin the kind of love which is preached by Christianity, by the\nmoderns, by the knights of the spirit. Yes, look at me, I am worse\nthan a heretic, I am a pagan.\n\n'Doest thou imagine long the goddess of love took counsel\nWhen in Ida's grove she was pleased with the hero Achilles?'\n\n\"These lines from Goethe's _Roman Elegy_ have always delighted me.\n\n\"In nature there is only the love of the heroic age, 'when gods and\ngoddesses loved.' At that time 'desire followed the glance, enjoyment\ndesire.' All else is factitious, affected, a lie. Christianity, whose\ncruel emblem, the cross, has always had for me an element of the\nmonstrous, brought something alien and hostile into nature and its\ninnocent instincts.\n\n\"The battle of the spirit with the senses is the gospel of modern\nman. I do not care to have a share in it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mount Olympus would be the place for you, madame,\" I replied,\n\"but we moderns can no longer support the antique serenity, least of\nall in love. The idea of sharing a woman, even if it were an Aspasia,\nwith another revolts us. We are jealous as is our God. For example,\nwe have made a term abuse out of the name of the glorious Phryne.\n\n\"We prefer one of Holbein's meagre, pallid virgins, which is wholly\nours to an antique Venus, no matter how divinely beautiful she is,\nbut who loves Anchises to-day, Paris to-morrow, Adonis the day after.\nAnd if nature triumphs in us so that we give our whole glowing,\npassionate devotion to such a woman, her serene joy of life appears\nto us as something demonic and cruel, and we read into our happiness\na sin which we must expiate.\"\n\n\"So you too are one of those who rave about modern women, those\nmiserable hysterical feminine creatures who don't appreciate a real\nman in their somnambulistic search for some dream-man and masculine\nideal. Amid tears and convulsions they daily outrage their Christian\nduties; they cheat and are cheated; they always seek again and choose\nand reject; they are never happy, and never give happiness. They\naccuse fate instead of calmly confessing that they want to love and\nlive as Helen and Aspasia lived. Nature admits of no permanence in\nthe relation between man and woman.\"\n\n\"But, my dear lady--\"\n\n\"Let me finish. It is only man's egoism which wants to keep woman\nlike some buried treasure. All endeavors to introduce permanence in\nlove, the most changeable thing in this changeable human existence,\nhave gone shipwreck in spite of religious ceremonies, vows, and\nlegalities. Can you deny that our Christian world has given itself\nover to corruption?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"But you are about to say, the individual who rebels against the\narrangements of society is ostracized, branded, stoned. So be it. I\nam willing to take the risk; my principles are very pagan. I will\nlive my own life as it pleases me. I am willing to do without your\nhypocritical respect; I prefer to be happy. The inventors of the\nChristian marriage have done well, simultaneously to invent\nimmortality. I, however, have no wish to live eternally. When with\nmy last breath everything as far as Wanda von Dunajew is concerned\ncomes to an end here below, what does it profit me whether my pure\nspirit joins the choirs of angels, or whether my dust goes into the\nformation of new beings? Shall I belong to one man whom I don't love,\nmerely because I have once loved him? No, I do not renounce; I love\neveryone who pleases me, and give happiness to everyone who loves me.\nIs that ugly? No, it is more beautiful by far, than if cruelly I\nenjoy the tortures, which my beauty excites, and virtuously reject\nthe poor fellow who is pining away for me. I am young, rich, and\nbeautiful, and I live serenely for the sake of pleasure and\nenjoyment.\"\n\nWhile she was speaking her eyes sparkled roguishly, and I had taken\nhold of her hands without exactly knowing what to do with them, but\nbeing a genuine dilettante I hastily let go of them again.\n\n\"Your frankness,\" I said, \"delights me, and not it alone--\"\n\nMy confounded dilettantism again throttled me as though there were\na rope around my neck.\n\n\"You were about to say--\"\n\n\"I was about to say--I was--I am sorry--I interrupted you.\"\n\n\"How, so?\"\n\nA long pause. She is doubtless engaging in a monologue, which\ntranslated into my language would be comprised in the single word,\n\"donkey.\"\n\n\"If I may ask,\" I finally began, \"how did you arrive at these--these\nconclusions?\"\n\n\"Quite simply, my father was an intelligent man. From my cradle onward\nI was surrounded by replicas of ancient art; at ten years of age I\nread _Gil Blas_, at twelve _La Pucelle_. Where others had\nHop-o'-my-thumb, Bluebeard, Cinderella, as childhood friends, mine\nwere Venus and Apollo, Hercules and Lackoon. My husband's personality\nwas filled with serenity and sunlight. Not even the incurable illness\nwhich fell upon him soon after our marriage could long cloud his brow.\nOn the very night of his death he took me in his arms, and during the\nmany months when he lay dying in his wheel chair, he often said\njokingly to me: 'Well, have you already picked out a lover?' I blushed\nwith shame. 'Don't deceive me,' he added on one occasion, 'that would\nseem ugly to me, but pick out an attractive lover, or preferably\nseveral. You are a splendid woman, but still half a child, and you\nneed toys.'\n\n\"I suppose, I hardly need tell you that during his life time I had\nno lover; but it was through him that I have become what I am, a\nwoman of Greece.\"\n\n\"A goddess,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"Which one,\" she smiled.\n\n\"Venus.\"\n\nShe threatened me with her finger and knitted her brows. \"Perhaps,\neven a 'Venus in Furs.' Watch out, I have a large, very large fur,\nwith which I could cover you up entirely, and I have a mind to catch\nyou in it as in a net.\"\n\n\"Do you believe,\" I said quickly, for an idea which seemed good, in\nspite of its conventionality and triteness, flashed into my head, \"do\nyou believe that your theories could be carried into execution at the\npresent time, that Venus would be permitted to stray with impunity\namong our railroads and telegraphs in all her undraped beauty and\nserenity?\"\n\n\"_Undraped_, of course not, but in furs,\" she replied smiling, \"would\nyou care to see mine?\"\n\n\"And then--\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Beautiful, free, serene, and happy human beings, such as the Greeks\nwere, are only possible when it is permitted to have _slaves_ who will\nperform the prosaic tasks of every day for them and above all else\nlabor for them.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she replied playfully, \"an Olympian divinity, such as\nI am, requires a whole army of slaves. Beware of me!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nI myself was frightened at the hardiness with which I uttered this\n\"why\"; it did not startle her in the least.\n\nShe drew back her lips a little so that her small white teeth became\nvisible, and then said lightly, as if she were discussing some\ntrifling matter, \"Do you want to be my slave?\"\n\n\"There is no equality in love,\" I replied solemnly. \"Whenever it is\na matter of choice for me of ruling or being ruled, it seems much\nmore satisfactory to me to be the slave of a beautiful woman. But\nwhere shall I find the woman who knows how to rule, calmly, full of\nself-confidence, even harshly, and not seek to gain her power by\nmeans of petty nagging?\"\n\n\"Oh, that might not be so difficult.\"\n\n\"You think--\"\n\n\"I--for instance--\" she laughed and leaned far back--\"I have a real\ntalent for despotism--I also have the necessary furs--but last night\nyou were really seriously afraid of me!\"\n\n\"Quite seriously.\"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"Now, I am more afraid of you than ever!\"\n\nWe are together every day, I and--Venus; we are together a great\ndeal. We breakfast in my honey-suckle arbor, and have tea in her\nlittle sitting-room. I have an opportunity to unfold all my small,\nvery small talents. Of what use would have been my study of all the\nvarious sciences, my playing at all the arts, if I were unable in the\ncase of a pretty, little woman--\n\nBut this woman is by no means little; in fact she impresses me\ntremendously. I made a drawing of her to-day, and felt particularly\nclearly, how inappropriate the modern way of dressing is for a\ncameo-head like hers. The configuration of her face has little of the\nRoman, but much of the Greek.\n\nSometimes I should like to paint her as Psyche, and then again as\nAstarte. It depends upon the expression in her eyes, whether it is\nvaguely dreamy, or half-consuming, filled with tired desire.\nShe, however, insists that it be a portrait-likeness.\n\nI shall make her a present of furs.\n\nHow could I have any doubts? If not for her, for whom would princely\nfurs be suitable?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI was with her yesterday evening, reading the _Roman Elegies_ to her.\nThen I laid the book aside, and improvised something for her. She\nseemed pleased; rather more than that, she actually hung upon my\nwords, and her bosom heaved.\n\nOr was I mistaken?\n\nThe rain beat in melancholy fashion on the window-panes, the fire\ncrackled in the fireplace in wintery comfort. I felt quite at home\nwith her, and for a moment lost all my fear of this beautiful woman;\nI kissed her hand, and she permitted it.\n\nThen I sat down at her feet and read a short poem I had written for\nher.\n\nVENUS IN FURS.\n\n\"Place thy foot upon thy slave,\nOh thou, half of hell, half of dreams;\nAmong the shadows, dark and grave,\nThy extended body softly gleams.\"\n\nAnd--so on. This time I really got beyond the first stanza. At her\nrequest I gave her the poem in the evening, keeping no copy. And now\nas I am writing this down in my diary I can only remember the first\nstanza.\n\nI am filled with a very curious sensation. I don't believe that I am\nin love with Wanda; I am sure that at our first meeting, I felt\nnothing of the lightning-like flashes of passion. But I feel how her\nextraordinary, really divine beauty is gradually winding magic snares\nabout me. It isn't any spiritual sympathy which is growing in me; it\nis a physical subjection, coming on slowly, but for that reason more\nabsolutely.\n\nI suffer under it more and more each day, and she--she merely smiles.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout any provocation she suddenly said to me to-day: \"You\ninterest me. Most men are very commonplace, without verve or poetry.\nIn you there is a certain depth and capacity for enthusiasm and a\ndeep seriousness, which delight me. I might learn to love you.\"\n\nAfter a short but severe shower we went out together to the meadow\nand the statue of Venus. All about us the earth steamed; mists rose\nup toward heaven like clouds of incense; a shattered rainbow still\nhovered in the air. The trees were still shedding drops, but sparrows\nand finches were already hopping from twig to twig. They are\ntwittering gaily, as if very much pleased at something. Everything\nis filled with a fresh fragrance. We cannot cross the meadow for it\nis still wet. In the sunlight it looks like a small pool, and the\ngoddess of love seems to rise from the undulations of its mirror-like\nsurface. About her head a swarm of gnats is dancing, which,\nilluminated by the sun, seem to hover above her like an aureole.\n\nWanda is enjoying the lovely scene. As all the benches along the\nwalk are still wet, she supports herself on my arm to rest a while.\nA soft weariness permeates her whole being, her eyes are half closed;\nI feel the touch of her breath on my cheek.\n\nHow I managed to get up courage enough I really don't know, but I\ntook hold of her hand, asking,\n\n\"Could you love me?\"\n\n\"Why not,\" she replied, letting her calm, clear look rest upon me,\nbut not for long.\n\nA moment later I am kneeling before her, pressing my burning face\nagainst the fragrant muslin of her gown.\n\n\"But Severin--this isn't right,\" she cried.\n\nBut I take hold of her little foot, and press my lips upon it.\n\n\"You are getting worse and worse!\" she cried. She tore herself free,\nand fled rapidly toward the house, the while her adorable slipper\nremained in my hand.\n\nIs it an omen?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAll day long I didn't dare to go near her. Toward evening as I was\nsitting in my arbor her gay red head peered suddenly through the\ngreenery of her balcony. \"Why don't you come up?\" he called down\nimpatiently.\n\nI ran upstairs, and at the top lost courage again. I knocked very\nlightly. She didn't say come-in, but opened the door herself, and\nstood on the threshold.\n\n\"Where is my slipper?\"\n\n\"It is--I have--I want,\" I stammered.\n\n\"Get it, and then we will have tea together, and chat.\"\n\nWhen I returned, she was engaged in making tea. I ceremoniously\nplaced the slipper on the table, and stood in the corner like a child\nawaiting punishment.\n\nI noticed that her brows were slightly contracted, and there was an\nexpression of hardness and dominance about her lips which delighted\nme.\n\nAll of a sudden she broke out laughing.\n\n\"So--you are really in love--with me?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I suffer more from it than you can imagine?\"\n\n\"You suffer?\" she laughed again.\n\nI was revolted, mortified, annihilated, but all this was quite\nuseless.\n\n\"Why?\" she continued, \"I like you, with all my heart.\"\n\nShe gave me her hand, and looked at me in the friendliest fashion.\n\n\"And will you be my wife?\"\n\nWanda looked at me--how did she look at me? I think first of all\nwith surprise, and then with a tinge of irony.\n\n\"What has given you so much courage, all at once?\"\n\n\"Courage?\"\n\n\"Yes courage, to ask anyone to be your wife, and me in particular?\"\nShe lifted up the slipper. \"Was it through a sudden friendship with\nthis? But joking aside. Do you really wish to marry me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, Severin, that is a serious matter. I believe, you love me,\nand I care for you too, and what is more important each of us finds\nthe other interesting. There is no danger that we would soon get\nbored, but, you know, I am a fickle person, and just for that reason\nI take marriage seriously. If I assume obligations, I want to be able\nto meet them. But I am afraid--no--it would hurt you.\"\n\n\"Please be perfectly frank with me,\" I replied.\n\n\"Well then honestly, I don't believe I could love a man longer than--\"\nShe inclined her head gracefully to one side and mused.\n\n\"A year.\"\n\n\"What do you imagine--a month perhaps.\"\n\n\"Not even me?\"\n\n\"Oh you--perhaps two.\"\n\n\"Two months!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Two months is very long.\"\n\n\"You go beyond antiquity, madame.\"\n\n\"You see, you cannot stand the truth.\"\n\nWanda walked across the room and leaned back against the fireplace,\nwatching me and resting one of her arms on the mantelpiece.\n\n\"What shall I do with you?\" she began anew.\n\n\"Whatever you wish,\" I replied with resignation, \"whatever will give\nyou pleasure.\"\n\n\"How illogical!\" she cried, \"first you want to make me your wife,\nand then you offer yourself to me as something to toy with.\"\n\n\"Wanda--I love you.\"\n\n\"Now we are back to the place where we started. You love me, and\nwant to make me your wife, but I don't want to enter into a new\nmarriage, because I doubt the permanence of both my and your\nfeelings.\"\n\n\"But if I am willing to take the risk with you?\" I replied.\n\n\"But it also depends on whether I am willing to risk it with you,\"\nshe said quietly. \"I can easily imagine belonging to one man for my\nentire life, but he would have to be a whole man, a man who would\ndominate me, who would subjugate me by his inate strength, do you\nunderstand? And every man--I know this very well--as soon as he falls\nin love becomes weak, pliable, ridiculous. He puts himself into the\nwoman's hands, kneels down before her. The only man whom I could love\npermanently would be he before whom I should have to kneel. I've gotten\nto like you so much, however, that I'll try it with you.\"\n\nI fell down at her feet.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, here you are kneeling already,\" she said\nmockingly. \"You are making a good beginning.\" When I had risen again\nshe continued, \"I will give you a year's time to win me, to convince\nme that we are suited to each other, that we might live together. If\nyou succeed, I will become your wife, and a wife, Severin, who will\nconscientiously and strictly perform all her duties. During this year\nwe will live as though we were married--\"\n\nMy blood rose to my head.\n\nIn her eyes too there was a sudden flame--\n\n\"We will live together,\" she continued, \"share our daily life, so that\nwe may find out whether we are really fitted for each other. _I grant\nyou all the rights of a husband, of a lover, of a friend._ Are you\nsatisfied?\"\n\n\"I suppose, I'll have to be?\"\n\n\"You don't have to.\"\n\n\"Well then, I want to--\"\n\n\"Splendid. That is how a man speaks. Here is my hand.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor ten days I have been with her every hour, except at night. All\nthe time I was allowed to look into her eyes, hold her hands, listen\nto what she said, accompany her wherever she went.\n\nMy love seems to me like a deep, bottomless abyss, into which I\nsubside deeper and deeper. There is nothing now which could save me\nfrom it.\n\nThis afternoon we were resting on the meadow at the foot of the\nVenus-statue. I plucked flowers and tossed them into her lap; she\nwound them into wreaths with which we adorned our goddess.\n\nSuddenly Wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses became\nconfused and passion swept over my head like a conflagration. Losing\ncommand over myself, I threw my arms about her and clung to her lips,\nand she--she drew me close to her heaving breast.\n\n\"Are you angry?\" I then asked her.\n\n\"I am never angry at anything that is natural--\" she replied, \"but\n_I_ am afraid you suffer.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am suffering frightfully.\"\n\n\"Poor friend!\" she brushed my disordered hair back from my fore-head. \"I\nhope it isn't through any fault of mine.\"\n\n\"No--\" I replied,--\"and yet my love for you has become a sort of\nmadness. The thought that I might lose you, perhaps actually lose\nyou, torments me day and night.\"\n\n\"But you don't yet possess me,\" said Wanda, and again she looked at\nme with that vibrant, consuming expression, which had already once\nbefore carried me away. Then she rose, and with her small transparent\nhands placed a wreath of blue anemones upon the ringletted white head\nof Venus. Half against my will I threw my arm around her body.\n\n\"I can no longer live without you, oh wonderful woman,\" I said.\n\"Believe me, believe only this once, that this time it is not a\nphrase, not a thing of dreams. I feel deep down in my innermost soul,\nthat my life belongs inseparably with yours. If you leave me, I shall\nperish, go to pieces.\"\n\n\"That will hardly be necessary, for I love you,\" she took hold of my\nchin, \"you foolish man!\"\n\n\"But you will be mine only under conditions, while I belong to you\nunconditionally--\"\n\n\"That isn't wise, Severin,\" she replied almost with a start. \"Don't\nyou know me yet, do you absolutely refuse to know me? I am good when\nI am treated seriously and reasonably, but when you abandon yourself\ntoo absolutely to me, I grow arrogant--\"\n\n\"So be it, be arrogant, be despotic,\" I cried in the fulness of\nexaltation, \"only be mine, mine forever.\" I lay at her feet,\nembracing her knees.\n\n\"Things will end badly, my friend,\" she said soberly, without moving.\n\n\"It shall never end,\" I cried excitedly, almost violently. \"Only death\nshall part us. If you cannot be mine, all mine and for always, then _I\nwant to be your slave_, serve you, suffer everything from you, if only\nyou won't drive me away.\"\n\n\"Calm yourself,\" she said, bending down and kissing my forehead, \"I\nam really very fond of you, but your way is not the way to win and\nhold me.\"\n\n\"I want to do everything, absolutely everything, that you want, only\nnot to lose you,\" I cried, \"only not that, I cannot bear the thought.\"\n\n\"Do get up.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"You are a strange person,\" continued Wanda. \"You wish to possess me\nat any price?\"\n\n\"Yes, at any price.\"\n\n\"But of what value, for instance, would that be?\"--She pondered; a\nlurking uncanny expression entered her eyes--\"If I no longer loved\nyou, if I belonged to another.\"\n\nA shudder ran through me. I looked at her She stood firmly and\nconfident before me, and her eyes disclosed a cold gleam.\n\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"the very thought frightens you.\" A\nbeautiful smile suddenly illuminated her face.\n\n\"I feel a perfect horror, when I imagine, that the woman I love and\nwho has responded to my love could give herself to another regardless\nof me. But have I still a choice? If I love such a woman, even unto\nmadness, shall I turn my back to her and lose everything for the sake\nof a bit of boastful strength; shall I send a bullet through my\nbrains? I have two ideals of woman. If I cannot obtain the one that\nis noble and simple, the woman who will faithfully and truly share\nmy life, well then I don't want anything half-way or lukewarm. Then\nI would rather be subject to a woman without virtue, fidelity, or pity.\nSuch a woman in her magnificent selfishness is likewise an ideal. If\nI am not permitted to enjoy the happiness of love, fully and wholly,\nI want to taste its pains and torments to the very dregs; I want to\nbe maltreated and betrayed by the woman I love, and the more cruelly\nthe better. This too is a luxury.\"\n\n\"Have you lost your senses,\" cried Wanda.\n\n\"I love you with all my soul,\" I continued, \"with all my senses, and\nyour presence and personality are absolutely essential to me, if I\nam to go on living. Choose between my ideals. Do with me what you will,\nmake of me your husband or your slave.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Wanda, contracting her small but strongly arched\nbrows, \"it seems to me it would be rather entertaining to have a man,\nwho interests me and loves me, completely in my power; at least I\nshall not lack pastime. You were imprudent enough to leave the choice\nto me. Therefore I choose; I want you to be my slave, I shall make\na plaything for myself out of you!\"\n\n\"Oh, please do,\" I cried half-shuddering, half-enraptured. \"If the\nfoundation of marriage depends on equality and agreement, it is\nlikewise true that the greatest passions rise out of opposites. We\nare such opposites, almost enemies. That is why my love is part hate,\npart fear. In such a relation only one can be hammer and the other\nanvil. I wish to be the anvil. I cannot be happy when I look down\nupon the woman I love. I want to adore a woman, and this I can only\ndo when she is cruel towards me.\"\n\n\"But, Severin,\" replied Wanda, almost angrily, \"do you believe me\ncapable of maltreating a man who loves me as you do, and whom I love?\"\n\n\"Why not, if I adore you the more on this account? _It is possible to\nlove really only that which stands above us,_ a woman, who through her\nbeauty, temperament, intelligence, and strength of will subjugates us\nand becomes a despot over us.\"\n\n\"Then that which repels others, attracts you.\"\n\n\"Yes. That is the strange part of me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, after all, there isn't anything so very unique or strange\nin all your passions, for who doesn't love beautiful furs? And\neveryone knows and feels how closely sexual love and cruelty are\nrelated.\"\n\n\"But in my case all these elements are raised to their highest\ndegree,\" I replied.\n\n\"In other words, reason has little power over you, and you are by\nnature, soft, sensual, yielding.\"\n\n\"Were the martyrs also soft and sensual by nature?\"\n\n\"The martyrs?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, they were _supersensual men,_ who found enjoyment in\nsuffering. They sought out the most frightful tortures, even death\nitself, as others seek joy, and as they were, so am I--_supersensual.\"_\n\n\"Have a care that in being such, you do not become a martyr to love,\nthe _martyr of a woman_.\"\n\nWe are sitting on Wanda's little balcony in the mellow fragrant\nsummer night. A twofold roof is above us, first the green ceiling of\nclimbing-plants, and then the vault of heaven sown with innumerable\nstars. The low wailing love-call of a cat rises from the park. I am\nsitting on footstool at the feet of my divinity, and am telling her\nof my childhood.\n\n\"And even then all these strange tendencies were distinctly marked\nin you?\" asked Wanda.\n\n\"Of course, I can't remember a time when I didn't have them. Even in\nmy cradle, so mother has told me, I was _supersensual._ I scorned the\nhealthy breast of my nurse, and had to be brought up on goats' milk.\nAs a little boy I was mysteriously shy before women, which really was\nonly an expression of an inordinate interest in them. I was oppressed\nby the gray arches and half-darknesses of the church, and actually\nafraid of the glittering altars and images of the saints. Secretly,\nhowever, I sneaked as to a secret joy to a plaster-Venus which stood\nin my father's little library. I kneeled down before her, and to her I\nsaid the prayers I had been taught--the Paternoster, the Ave Maria,\nand the Credo.\n\n\"Once at night I left my bed to visit her. The sickle of the moon\nwas my light and showed me the goddess in a pale-blue cold light. I\nprostrated myself before her and kissed her cold feet, as I had seen\nour peasants do when they kissed the feet of the dead Savior.\n\n\"An irresistible yearning seized me.\n\n\"I got up and embraced the beautiful cold body and kissed the cold\nlips. A deep shudder fell upon me and I fled, and later in a dream,\nit seemed to me, as if the goddess stood beside my bed, threatening\nme with up-raised arm.\n\n\"I was sent to school early and soon reached the gymnasium. I\npassionately grasped at everything which promised to make the world\nof antiquity accessible to me. Soon I was more familiar with the gods\nof Greece than with the religion of Jesus. I was with Paris when he\ngave the fateful apple to Venus, I saw Troy burn, and followed\nUlysses on his wanderings. The prototypes of all that is beautiful\nsank deep into my soul, and consequently at the time when other boys\nare coarse and obscene, I displayed an insurmountable aversion to\neverything base, vulgar, unbeautiful.\n\n\"To me, the maturing youth, love for women seemed something\nespecially base and unbeautiful, for it showed itself to me first in\nall its commonness. I avoided all contact with the fair sex; in\nshort, I was supersensual to madness.\n\n\"When I was about fourteen my mother had a charming chamber-maid,\nyoung, attractive, with a figure just budding into womanhood. I was\nsitting one day studying my Tacitus and growing enthusiastic over the\nvirtues of the ancient Teutons, while she was sweeping my room.\nSuddenly she stopped, bent down over me, in the meantime holding fast\nto the broom, and a pair of fresh, full, adorable lips touched mine.\nThe kiss of the enamoured little cat ran through me like a shudder,\nbut I raised up my _Germania_, like a shield against the temptress,\nand indignantly left the room.\"\n\nWanda broke out in loud laughter. \"It would, indeed, be hard to find\nanother man like you, but continue.\"\n\n\"There is another unforgetable incident belonging to that period,\"\nI continued my story. \"Countess Sobol, a distant aunt of mine, was\nvisiting my parents. She was a beautiful majestic woman with an\nattractive smile. I, however, hated her, for she was regarded by the\nfamily as a sort of Messalina. My behavior toward her was as rude,\nmalicious, and awkward as possible.\n\n\"One day my parents drove to the capital of the district. My aunt\ndetermined to take advantage of their absence, and to exercise\njudgment over me. She entered unexpectedly in her fur-lined\n_kazabaika,_ [Footnote: A woman's jacket.] followed by the cook,\nkitchen-maid, and the cat of a chamber-maid whom I had scorned.\nWithout asking any questions, they seized me and bound me hand and\nfoot, in spite of my violent resistance. Then my aunt, with an evil\nsmile, rolled up her sleeve and began to whip me with a stout switch.\nShe whipped so hard that the blood flowed, and that, at last,\nnotwithstanding my heroic spirit, I cried and wept and begged for\nmercy. She then had me untied, but I had to get down on my knees and\nthank her for the punishment and kiss her hand.\n\n\"Now you understand the supersensual fool! Under the lash of a\nbeautiful woman my senses first realized the meaning of woman. In her\nfur-jacket she seemed to me like a wrathful queen, and from then on\nmy aunt became the most desirable woman on God's earth.\n\n\"My Cato-like austerity, my shyness before woman, was nothing but an\nexcessive feeling for beauty. In my imagination sensuality became a\nsort of cult. I took an oath to myself that I would not squander its\nholy wealth upon any ordinary person, but I would reserve it for an\nideal woman, if possible for the goddess of love herself.\n\n\"I went to the university at a very early age. It was in the capital\nwhere my aunt lived. My room looked at that time like Doctor\nFaustus's. Everything in it was in a wild confusion. There were huge\nclosets stuffed full of books, which I bought for a song from a\nJewish dealer on the Servanica; [Footnote: The street of the Jews in\nLemberg.] there were globes, atlases, flasks, charts of the heavens,\nskeletons of animals, skulls, the busts of eminent men. It looked as\nthough Mephistopheles might have stepped out from behind the huge\ngreen store as a wandering scholiast at any moment.\n\n\"I studied everything in a jumble without system, without selection:\nchemistry, alchemy, history, astronomy, philosophy, law, anatomy, and\nliterature; I read Homer, Virgil, Ossian, Schiller, Goethe,\nShakespeare, Cervantes, Voltaire, Moliere, the Koran, the Kosmos,\nCasanova's Memoirs. I grew more confused each day, more fantastical,\nmore supersensual. All the time a beautiful ideal woman hovered in my\nimagination. Every so and so often she appeared before me like a\nvision among my leather-bound books and dead bones, lying on a bed of\nroses, surrounded by cupids. Sometimes she appeared gowned like the\nOlympians with the stern white face of the plaster Venus; sometimes in\nbraids of a rich brown, blue-eyes, in my aunt's red velvet\n_kazabaika,_ trimmed with ermine.\n\n\"One morning when she had again risen out of the golden mist of my\nimagination in all her smiling beauty, I went to see Countess Sobol,\nwho received me in a friendly, even cordial manner. She gave me a\nkiss of welcome, which put all my senses in a turmoil. She was\nprobably about forty years old, but like most well-preserved women\nof the world, still very attractive. She wore as always her fur-edged\njacket. This time it was one of green velvet with brown marten. But\nnothing of the sternness which had so delighted me the other time was\nnow discernable.\n\n\"On the contrary, there was so little of cruelty in her that without\nany more ado she let me adore her.\n\n\"Only too soon did she discover my supersensual folly and innocence,\nand it pleased her to make me happy. As for myself--I was as happy\nas a young god. What rapture for me to be allowed to lie before her\non my knees, and to kiss her hands, those with which she had scourged\nme! What marvellous hands they were, of beautiful form, delicate,\nrounded, and white, with adorable dimples! I really was in love with\nher hands only. I played with them, let them submerge and emerge in\nthe dark fur, held them against the light, and was unable to satiate\nmy eyes with them.\"\n\nWanda involuntarily looked at her hand; I noticed it, and had to\nsmile.\n\n\"From the way in which the supersensual predominated in me in those\ndays you can see that I was in love only with the cruel lashes I\nreceived from my aunt; and about two years later when I paid court\nto a young actress only in the roles she played. Still later I became\nthe admirer of a respectable woman. She acted the part of\nirreproachable virtue, only in the end to betray me with a rich Jew.\nYou see, it is because I was betrayed, sold, by a woman who feigned\nthe strictest principles and the highest ideals, that I hate that\nsort of poetical, sentimental virtue so intensely. Give me rather a\nwoman who is honest enough to say to me: I am a Pompadour, a Lucretia\nBorgia, and I am ready to adore her.\"\n\nWanda rose and opened the window.\n\n\"You have a curious way of arousing one's imagination, stimulating\nall one's nerves, and making one's pulses beat faster. You put an\naureole on vice, provided only if it is honest. Your ideal is a\ndaring courtesan of genius. Oh, you are the kind of man who will\ncorrupt a woman to her very last fiber.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the middle of the night there was a knock at my window; I got up,\nopened it, and was startled. Without stood \"Venus in Furs,\" just as\nshe had appeared to me the first time.\n\n\"You have disturbed me with your stories; I have been tossing about\nin bed, and can't go to sleep,\" she said. \"Now come and stay with me.\"\n\n\"In a moment.\"\n\nAs I entered Wanda was crouching by the fireplace where she had\nkindled a small fire.\n\n\"Autumn is coming,\" she began, \"the nights are really quite cold\nalready. I am afraid you may not like it, but I can't put off my furs\nuntil the room is sufficiently warm.\"\n\n\"Not like it--you are joking--you know--\" I threw my arm around her,\nand kissed her.\n\n\"Of course, I know, but why this great fondness for furs?\"\n\n\"I was born with it,\" I replied. \"I already had it as a child.\nFurthermore furs have a stimulating effect on all highly organized\nnatures. This is due both to general and natural laws. It is a\nphysical stimulus which sets you tingling, and no one can wholly\nescape it. Science has recently shown a certain relationship between\nelectricity and warmth; at any rate, their effects upon the human\norganism are related. The torrid zone produces more passionate\ncharacters, a heated atmosphere stimulation. Likewise with\nelectricity. This is the reason why the presence of cats exercises\nsuch a magic influence upon highly-organized men of intellect. This\nis why these long-tailed Graces of the animal kingdom, these\nadorable, scintillating electric batteries have been the favorite\nanimal of a Mahommed, Cardinal Richelieu, Crebillon, Rousseau,\nWieland.\"\n\n\"A woman wearing furs, then,\" cried Wanda, \"is nothing else than a\nlarge cat, an augmented electric battery?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied. \"That is my explanation of the symbolic\nmeaning which fur has acquired as the attribute of power and beauty.\nMonarchs and the dominant higher nobility in former times used it in\nthis sense for their costume, exclusively; great painters used it\nonly for queenly beauty. The most beautiful frame, which Raphael\ncould find for the divine forms of Fornarina and Titian for the\nroseate body of his beloved, was dark furs.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the learned discourse on love,\" said Wanda, \"but you\nhaven't told me everything. You associate something entirely\nindividual with furs.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I cried. \"I have repeatedly told you that suffering has\na peculiar attraction for me. Nothing can intensify my passion more\nthan tyranny, cruelty, and especially the faithlessness of a\nbeautiful woman. And I cannot imagine this woman, this strange ideal\nderived from an aesthetics of ugliness, this soul of Nero in the body\nof a Phryne, except in furs.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Wanda interrupted. \"It gives a dominant and imposing\nquality to a woman.\"\n\n\"Not only that,\" I continued. \"You know I am _supersensual._ With me\neverything has its roots in the imagination, and thence it receives\nits nourishment. I was already pre-maturely developed and highly\nsensitive, when at about the age of ten the legends of the martyrs\nfell into my hands. I remember reading with a kind of horror, which\nreally was rapture, of how they pined in prisons, were laid on the\ngridiron, pierced with arrows, boiled in pitch, thrown to wild\nanimals, nailed to the cross, and suffered the most horrible torment\nwith a kind of joy. To suffer and endure cruel torture from then on\nseemed to me exquisite delight, especially when it was inflicted by a\nbeautiful woman, for ever since I can remember all poetry and\neverything demonic was for me concentrated in woman. I literally\ncarried the idea into a sort of cult.\n\n\"I felt there was something sacred in sex; in fact, it was the only\nsacred thing. In woman and her beauty I saw something divine, because\nthe most important function of existence--the continuation of the\nspecies--is her vocation. To me woman represented a personification of\nnature, _Isis_, and man was her priest, her slave. In contrast to him\nshe was cruel like nature herself who tosses aside whatever has served\nher purposes as soon as she no longer has need for it. To him her\ncruelties, even death itself, still were sensual raptures.\n\n\"I envied King Gunther whom the mighty Brunhilde fettered on the\nbridal night, and the poor troubadour whom his capricious mistress\nhad sewed in the skins of wolves to have him hunted like game. I\nenvied the Knight Ctirad whom the daring Amazon Scharka craftily\nensnared in a forest near Prague, and carried to her castle Divin,\nwhere, after having amused herself a while with him, she had him\nbroken on the wheel--\"\n\n\"Disgusting,\" cried Wanda. \"I almost wish you might fall into the\nhands of a woman of their savage race. In the wolf's skin, under the\nteeth of the dogs, or upon the wheel, you would lose the taste for\nyour kind of poetry.\"\n\n\"Do you think so? I hardly do.\"\n\n\"Have you actually lost your senses.\"\n\n\"Possibly. But let me go on. I developed a perfect passion for\nreading stories in which the extremest cruelties were described. I\nloved especially to look at pictures and prints which represented\nthem. All the sanguinary tyrants that ever occupied a throne; the\ninquisitors who had the heretics tortured, roasted, and butchered;\nall the woman whom the pages of history have recorded as lustful,\nbeautiful, and violent women like Libussa, Lucretia Borgia, Agnes of\nHungary, Queen Margot, Isabeau, the Sultana Roxolane, the Russian\nCzarinas of last century--all these I saw in furs or in robes\nbordered with ermine.\"\n\n\"And so furs now rouse strange imaginings in you,\" said Wanda, and\nsimultaneously she began to drape her magnificent fur-cloak\ncoquettishly about her, so that the dark shining sable played\nbeautifully around her bust and arms. \"Well, how do you feel now,\nhalf broken on the wheel?\"\n\nHer piercing green eyes rested on me with a peculiar mocking\nsatisfaction. Overcome by desire, I flung myself down before her, and\nthrew my arms about her.\n\n\"Yes--you have awakened my dearest dream,\" I cried. \"It has slept\nlong enough.\"\n\n\"And this is?\" She put her hand on my neck.\n\nI was seized with a sweet intoxication under the influence of this\nwarm little hand and of her regard, which, tenderly searching, fell\nupon me through her half-closed lids.\n\n_\"To be the slave of a woman, a beautiful woman, whom I love, whom\nI worship.\"_\n\n\"And who on that account maltreats you,\" interrupted Wanda, laughing.\n\n\"Yes, who fetters me and whips me, treads me underfoot, the while\nshe gives herself to another.\"\n\n\"And who in her wantonness will go so far as to make a present of\nyou to your successful rival when driven insane by jealousy you must\nmeet him face to face, who will turn you over to his absolute mercy.\nWhy not? This final tableau doesn't please you so well?\"\n\nI looked at Wanda frightened.\n\n\"You surpass my dreams.\"\n\n\"Yes, we women are inventive,\" she said, \"take heed, when you find\nyour ideal, it might easily happen, that she will treat you more\ncruelly than you anticipate.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that I have already found my ideal!\" I exclaimed,\nburying my burning face in her lap.\n\n\"Not I?\" exclaimed Wanda, throwing off her furs and moving about the\nroom laughing. She was still laughing as I went downstairs, and when\nI stood musing in the yard, I still heard her peals of laughter above.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Do you really then expect me to embody your ideal?\" Wanda asked\narchly, when we met in the park to-day.\n\nAt first I could find no answer. The most antagonistic emotions were\nbattling within me. In the meantime she sat down on one of the\nstone-benches, and played with a flower.\n\n\"Well--am I?\"\n\nI kneeled down and seized her hands.\n\n\"Once more I beg you to become my wife, my true and loyal wife; if\nyou can't do that then become the embodiment of my ideal, absolutely,\nwithout reservation, without softness.\"\n\n\"You know I am ready at the end of a year to give you my hand, if\nyou prove to be the man I am seeking,\" Wanda replied very seriously,\n\"but I think you would be more grateful to me if through me you\nrealized your imaginings. Well, which do you prefer?\"\n\n\"I believe that everything my imagination has dreamed lies latent in\nyour personality.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" I continued, \"that you enjoy having a man wholly in\nyour power, torturing him--\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she exclaimed quickly, \"or perhaps--.\" She pondered.\n\n\"I don't understand myself any longer,\" she continued, \"but I have\na confession to make to you. You have corrupted my imagination and\ninflamed my blood. I am beginning to like the things you speak of.\nThe enthusiasm with which you speak of a Pompadour, a Catherine the\nSecond, and all the other selfish, frivolous, cruel women, carries\nme away and takes hold of my soul. It urges me on to become like those\nwomen, who in spite of their vileness were slavishly adored during\ntheir lifetime and still exert a miraculous power from their graves.\n\n\"You will end by making of me a despot in miniature, a domestic\nPompadour.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" I said in agitation, \"if all this is inherent in you,\ngive way to this trend of your nature. Nothing half-way. If you can't\nbe a true and loyal wife to me, be a demon.\"\n\nI was nervous from loss of sleep, and the proximity of the beautiful\nwoman affected me like a fever. I no longer recall what I said, but\nI remember that I kissed her feet, and finally raised her foot and\nput my neck under it. She withdrew it quickly, and rose almost angrily.\n\n\"If you love me, Severin,\" she said quickly, and her voice sounded\nsharp and commanding, \"never speak to me of those things again.\nUnderstand, never! Otherwise I might really--\" She smiled and sat\ndown again.\n\n\"I am entirely serious,\" I exclaimed, half-raving. \"I adore you so\ninfinitely that I am willing to suffer anything from you, for the\nsake of spending my whole life near you.\"\n\n\"Severin, once more I warn you.\"\n\n\"Your warning is vain. Do with me what you will, as long as you\ndon't drive me away.\"\n\n\"Severin,\" replied Wanda, \"I am a frivolous young woman; it is\ndangerous for you to put yourself so completely in my power. You will\nend by actually becoming a plaything to me. Who will give warrant\nthat I shall not abuse your insane desire?\"\n\n\"Your own nobility of character.\"\n\n\"Power makes people over-bearing.\"\n\n\"Be it,\" I cried, \"tread me underfoot.\"\n\nWanda threw her arms around my neck, looked into my eyes, and shook\nher head.\n\n\"I am afraid I can't, but I will try, for your sake, for I love you\nSeverin, as I have loved no other man.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day she suddenly took her hat and shawl, and I had to go shopping\nwith her. She looked at whips, long whips with a short handle, the\nkind that are used on dogs.\n\n\"Are these satisfactory?\" said the shopkeeper.\n\n\"No, they are much too small,\" replied Wanda, with a side-glance at\nme. \"I need a large--\"\n\n\"For a bull-dog, I suppose?\" opined the merchant.\n\n\"Yes,\" she exclaimed, \"of the kind that are used in Russia for\nintractable slaves.\"\n\nShe looked further and finally selected a whip, at whose sight I\nfelt a strange creeping sensation.\n\n\"Now good-by, Severin,\" she said. \"I have some other purchases to\nmake, but you can't go along.\"\n\nI left her and took a walk. On the way back I saw Wanda coming out\nat a furrier's. She beckoned me.\n\n\"Consider it well,\" she began in good spirits, \"I have never made a\nsecret of how deeply your serious, dreamy character has fascinated\nme. The idea of seeing this serious man wholly in my power, actually\nlying enraptured at my feet, of course, stimulates me--but will this\nattraction last? Woman loves a man; she maltreats a slave, and ends\nby kicking him aside.\"\n\n\"Very well then, kick me aside,\" I replied, \"when you are tired of\nme. I want to be your slave.\"\n\n\"Dangerous forces lie within me,\" said Wanda, after we had gone a\nfew steps further. \"You awaken them, and not to your advantage. You\nknow how to paint pleasure, cruelty, arrogance in glowing colors.\nWhat would you say should I try my hand at them, and make you the\nfirst object of my experiments. I would be like Dionysius who had the\ninventor of the iron ox roasted within it in order to see whether his\nwails and groans really resembled the bellowing of an ox.\n\n\"Perhaps I am a female Dionysius?\"\n\n\"Be it,\" I exclaimed, \"and my dreams will be fulfilled. I am yours\nfor good or evil, choose. The destiny that lies concealed within my\nbreast drives me on--demoniacally--relentlessly.\"\n\n\"My Beloved,\n\nI do not care to see you to-day or to-morrow, and not until evening\nthe day after tomorrow, and then _as my slave_.\n\nYour mistress\n\nWanda.\"\n\n\"As my slave\" was underlined. I read the note which I received early\nin the morning a second time. Then I had a donkey saddled, an animal\nsymbolic of learned professors, and rode into the mountains. I wanted\nto numb my desire, my yearning, with the magnificent scenery of the\nCarpathians. I am back, tired, hungry, thirsty, and more in love than\never. I quickly change my clothes, and a few moments later knock at\nher door.\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nI enter. She is standing in the center of the room, dressed in a gown\nof white satin which floods down her body like light. Over it she\nwears a scarlet _kazabaika_, richly edged with ermine. Upon her\npowdered, snowy hair is a little diadem of diamonds. She stands with\nher arms folded across her breast, and with her brows contracted.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I run toward her, and am about to throw my arm about her to\nkiss her. She retreats a step, measuring me from top to bottom.\n\n\"Slave!\"\n\n\"Mistress!\" I kneel down, and kiss the hem of her garment.\n\n\"That is as it should be.\"\n\n\"Oh, how beautiful you are.\"\n\n\"Do I please you?\" She stepped before the mirror, and looked at\nherself with proud satisfaction.\n\n\"I shall become mad!\"\n\nHer lower lip twitched derisively, and she looked at me mockingly\nfrom behind half-closed lids.\n\n\"Give me the whip.\"\n\nI looked about the room.\n\n\"No,\" she exclaimed, \"stay as you are, kneeling.\" She went over to\nthe fire-place, took the whip from the mantle-piece, and, watching\nme with a smile, let it hiss through the air; then she slowly rolled\nup the sleeve of her fur-jacket.\n\n\"Marvellous woman!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Silence, slave!\" She suddenly scowled, looked savage, and struck me\nwith the whip. A moment later she threw her arm tenderly about me, and\npityingly bent down to me. \"Did I hurt you?\" she asked, half-shyly,\nhalf-timidly.\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"and even if you had, pains that come through you\nare a joy. Strike again, if it gives you pleasure.\"\n\n\"But it doesn't give me pleasure.\"\n\nAgain I was seized with that strange intoxication.\n\n\"Whip me,\" I begged, \"whip me without mercy.\"\n\nWanda swung the whip, and hit me twice. \"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Seriously, no?\"\n\n\"Whip me, I beg you, it is a joy to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, because you know very well that it isn't serious,\" she\nreplied, \"because I haven't the heart to hurt you. This brutal game\ngoes against my grain. Were I really the woman who beats her slaves\nyou would be horrified.\"\n\n\"No, Wanda,\" I replied, \"I love you more than myself; I am devoted\nto you for death and life. In all seriousness, you can do with me\nwhatever you will, whatever your caprice suggests.\"\n\n\"Severin!\"\n\n\"Tread me underfoot!\" I exclaimed, and flung myself face to the\nfloor before her.\n\n\"I hate all this play-acting,\" said Wanda impatiently.\n\n\"Well, then maltreat me seriously.\"\n\nAn uncanny pause.\n\n\"Severin, I warn you for the last time,\" began Wanda.\n\n\"If you love me, be cruel towards me,\" I pleaded with upraised eyes.\n\n\"If I love you,\" repeated Wanda. \"Very well!\" She stepped back and\nlooked at me with a sombre smile. _\"Be then my slave, and know what\nit means to be delivered into the hands of a woman.\"_ And at the\nsame moment she gave me a kick.\n\n\"How do you like that, slave?\"\n\nThen she flourished the whip.\n\n\"Get up!\"\n\nI was about to rise.\n\n\"Not that way,\" she commanded, \"on your knees.\"\n\nI obeyed, and she began to apply the lash.\n\nThe blows fell rapidly and powerfully on my back and arms. Each one\ncut into my flesh and burned there, but the pains enraptured me. They\ncame from her whom I adored, and for whom I was ready at any hour to\nlay down my life.\n\nShe stopped. \"I am beginning to enjoy it,\" she said, \"but enough for\nto-day. I am beginning to feel a demonic curiosity to see how far\nyour strength goes. I take a cruel joy in seeing you tremble and\nwrithe beneath my whip, and in hearing your groans and wails; I want\nto go on whipping without pity until you beg for mercy, until you\nlose your senses. You have awakened dangerous elements in my being.\nBut now get up.\"\n\nI seized her hand to press it to my lips.\n\n\"What impudence.\"\n\nShe shoved me away with her foot.\n\n\"Out of my sight, slave!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter having spent a feverish night filled with confused dreams, I\nawoke. Dawn was just beginning to break.\n\nHow much of what was hovering in my memory was true; what had I\nactually experienced and what had I dreamed? That I had been whipped\nwas certain. I can still feel each blow, and count the burning red\nstripes on my body. And _she_ whipped me. Now I know everything.\n\nMy dream has become truth. How does it make me feel? Am I\ndisappointed in the realization of my dream?\n\nNo, I am merely somewhat tired, but her cruelty has enraptured me.\nOh, how I love her, adore her! All this cannot express in the\nremotest way my feeling for her, my complete devotion to her. What\nhappiness to be her slave!\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe calls to me from her balcony. I hurry upstairs. She is standing\non the threshold, holding out her hand in friendly fashion. \"I am\nashamed of myself,\" she says, while I embrace her, and she hides her\nhead against my breast.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Please try to forget the ugly scene of yesterday,\" she said with\nquivering voice, \"I have fulfilled your mad wish, now let us be\nreasonable and happy and love each other, and in a year I will be\nyour wife.\"\n\n\"My mistress,\" I exclaimed, \"and I your slave!\"\n\n\"Not another word of slavery, cruelty, or the whip,\" interrupted\nWanda. \"I shall not grant you any of those favors, none except\nwearing my fur-jacket; come and help me into it.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe little bronze clock on which stood a cupid who had just shot his\nbolt struck midnight.\n\nI rose, and wanted to leave.\n\nWanda said nothing, but embraced me and drew me back on the ottoman.\nShe began to kiss me anew, and this silent language was so\ncomprehensible, so convincing--\n\nAnd it told me more than I dared to understand.\n\nA languid abandonment pervaded Wanda's entire being. What a\nvoluptuous softness there was in the gloaming of her half-closed\neyes, in the red flood of her hair which shimmered faintly under the\nwhite powder, in the red and white satin which crackled about her\nwith every movement, in the swelling ermine of the _kazabaika_\nin which she carelessly nestled.\n\n\"Please,\" I stammered, \"but you will be angry with me.\"\n\n\"Do with me what you will,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Well, then whip me, or I shall go mad.\"\n\n\"Haven't I forbidden you,\" said Wanda sternly, \"but you are\nincorrigible.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so terribly in love.\" I had sunken on my knees, and was\nburying my glowing face in her lap.\n\n\"I really believe,\" said Wanda thoughtfully, \"that your madness is\nnothing but a demonic, unsatisfied sensuality. _Our unnatural way\nof life must generate such illnesses._ Were you less virtuous, you\nwould be completely sane.\"\n\n\"Well then, make me sane,\" I murmured. My hands were running through\nher hair and playing tremblingly with the gleaming fur, which rose\nand fell like a moonlit wave upon her heaving bosom, and drove all\nmy senses into confusion.\n\nAnd I kissed her. No, she kissed me savagely, pitilessly, as if she\nwanted to slay me with her kisses. I was as in a delirium, and had\nlong since lost my reason, but now I, too, was breathless. I sought\nto free myself.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Wanda.\n\n\"I am suffering agonies.\"\n\n\"You are suffering--\" she broke out into a loud amused laughter.\n\n\"You laugh!\" I moaned, \"have you no idea--\"\n\nShe was serious all of a sudden. She raised my head in her hands,\nand with a violent gesture drew me to her breast.\n\n\"Wanda,\" I stammered.\n\n\"Of course, you enjoy suffering,\" she said, and laughed again, \"but\nwait, I'll bring you to your senses.\"\n\n\"No, I will no longer ask,\" I exclaimed, \"whether you want to belong\nto me for always or for only a brief moment of intoxication. I want\nto drain my happiness to the full. You are mine now, and I would\nrather lose you than never to have had you.\"\n\n\"Now you are sensible,\" she said. She kissed me again with her\nmurderous lips. I tore the ermine apart and the covering of lace and\nher naked breast surged against mine.\n\nThen my senses left me--\n\nThe first thing I remember is the moment when I saw blood dripping\nfrom my hand, and she asked apathetically: \"Did you scratch me?\"\n\n\"No, I believe, I have bitten you.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is strange how every relation in life assumes a different face as\nsoon as a new person enters.\n\nWe spent marvellous days together; we visited the mountains and\nlakes, we read together, and I completed Wanda's portrait. And how\nwe loved one another, how beautiful her smiling face was!\n\nThen a friend of hers arrived, a divorced woman somewhat older, more\nexperienced, and less scrupulous than Wanda. Her influence is already\nmaking itself felt in every direction.\n\nWanda wrinkles her brows, and displays a certain impatience with me.\n\nHas she ceased loving me?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor almost a fortnight this unbearable restraint has lain upon us.\nHer friend lives with her, and we are never alone. A circle of men\nsurrounds the young women. With my seriousness and melancholy I am\nplaying an absurd role as lover. Wanda treats me like a stranger.\n\nTo-day, while out walking, she staid behind with me. I saw that this\nwas done intentionally, and I rejoiced. But what did she tell me?\n\n\"My friend doesn't understand how I can love you. She doesn't think\nyou either handsome or particularly attractive otherwise. She is\ntelling me from morning till night about the glamour of the frivolous\nlife in the capital, hinting at the advantages to which I could lay\nclaim, the large parties which I would find there, and the\ndistinguished and handsome admirers which I would attract. But of\nwhat use is all this, since it happens that I love you.\"\n\nFor a moment I lost my breath, then I said: \"I have no wish to stand\nin the way of your happiness, Wanda. Do not consider me.\" Then I\nraised my hat, and let her go ahead. She looked at me surprised, but\ndid not answer a syllable.\n\nWhen by chance I happened to be close to her on the way back, she\nsecretly pressed my hand. Her glance was so radiant, so full of\npromised happiness, that in a moment all the torments of these days\nwere forgotten and all their wounds healed.\n\nI now am aware again of how much I love her.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"My friend has complained about you,\" said Wanda to-day.\n\n\"Perhaps she feels that I despise her.\"\n\n\"But why do you despise her, you foolish young man?\" exclaimed\nWanda, pulling my ears with both hands.\n\n\"Because she is a hypocrite,\" I said. \"I respect only a woman who is\nactually virtuous, or who openly lives for pleasure's sake.\"\n\n\"Like me, for instance,\" replied Wanda jestingly, \"but you see,\nchild, a woman can only do that in the rarest cases. She can neither\nbe as gaily sensual, nor as spiritually free as man; her state is\nalways a mixture of the sensual and spiritual. Her heart desires to\nenchain man permanently, while she herself is ever subject to the\ndesire for change. The result is a conflict, and thus usually against\nher wishes lies and deception enter into her actions and personality\nand corrupt her character.\"\n\n\"Certainly that is true,\" I said. \"The transcendental character with\nwhich woman wants to stamp love leads her to deception.\"\n\n\"But the world likewise demands it,\" Wanda interrupted. \"Look at\nthis woman. She has a husband and a lover in Lemberg and has found\na new admirer here. She deceives all three and yet is honored by all\nand respected by the world.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" I exclaimed, \"but she is to leave you alone; she\ntreats you like an article of commerce.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the beautiful woman interrupted vivaciously. \"Every woman\nhas the instinct or desire to draw advantage out of her attractions,\nand much is to be said for giving one's self without love or pleasure\nbecause if you do it in cold blood, you can reap profit to best\nadvantage.\"\n\n\"Wanda, what are you saying?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" she said, \"and take note of what I am about to say to you.\n_Never feel secure with the woman you love,_ for there are more\ndangers in woman's nature than you imagine. Women are neither as\n_good_ as their admirers and defenders maintain, nor as _bad_ as their\nenemies make them out to be. _Woman's character is characterlessness._\nThe best woman will momentarily go down into the mire, and the worst\nunexpectedly rises to deeds of greatness and goodness and puts to\nshame those that despise her. No woman is so good or so bad, but that\nat any moment she is capable of the most diabolical as well as of the\nmost divine, of the filthiest as well as of the purest, thoughts,\nemotions, and actions. In spite of all the advances of civilization,\nwoman has remained as she came out of the hand of nature. She has the\nnature of a savage, who is faithful or faithless, magnanimous or\ncruel, according to the impulse that dominates at the moment.\nThroughout history it has always been a serious deep culture which has\nproduced moral character. Man even when he is selfish or evil always\nfollows _principles,_ woman never follows anything but _impulses._\nDon't ever forget that, and never feel secure with the woman you\nlove.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nHer friend has left. At last an evening alone with her again. It\nseems as if Wanda had saved up all the love, which had been kept from\nher, for this superlative evening; never had she been so kind, so\nnear, so full of tenderness.\n\nWhat happiness to cling to her lips, and to die away in her arms! In\na state of relaxation and wholly mine, her head rests against my\nbreast, and with drunken rapture our eyes seek each other.\n\nI cannot yet believe, comprehend, that this woman is mine, wholly\nmine.\n\n\"She is right on one point,\" Wanda began, without moving, without\nopening her eyes, as if she were asleep.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nShe remained silent.\n\n\"Your friend?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes, she is right, you are not a man, you are a\ndreamer, a charming cavalier, and you certainly would be a priceless\nslave, but I cannot imagine you as husband.\"\n\nI was frightened.\n\n\"What is the matter? You are trembling?\"\n\n\"I tremble at the thought of how easily I might lose you,\" I replied.\n\n\"Are you made less happy now, because of this?\" she replied. \"Does\nit rob you of any of your joys, that I have belonged to another\nbefore I did to you, that others after you will possess me, and would\nyou enjoy less if another were made happy simultaneously with you?\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"that would be a way out. You won't ever\nlose me then. I care deeply for you and intellectually we are\nharmonious, and I should like to live with you always, if in addition\nto you I might have--\"\n\n\"What an idea,\" I cried. \"You fill me with a sort of horror.\"\n\n\"Do you love me any the less?\"\n\n\"On the contrary.\"\n\nWanda had raised herself on her left arm. \"I believe,\" she said,\n\"that to hold a man permanently, it is vitally important not to be\nfaithful to him. What honest woman has ever been as devotedly loved\nas a hetaira?\"\n\n\"There is a painful stimulus in the unfaithfulness of a beloved\nwoman. It is the highest kind of ecstacy.\"\n\n\"For you, too?\" Wanda asked quickly.\n\n\"For me, too.\"\n\n\"And if I should give you that pleasure,\" Wanda exclaimed mockingly.\n\n\"I shall suffer terrible agonies, but I shall adore you the more,\"\nI replied. \"But you would never deceive me, you would have the daemonic\ngreatness of saying to me: I shall love no one but you, but I shall\nmake happy whoever pleases me.\"\n\nWanda shook her head. \"I don't like deception, I am honest, but what\nman exists who can support the burden of truth. Were I say to you:\nthis serene, sensual life, this paganism is my ideal, would you be\nstrong enough to bear it?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I could endure anything so as not to lose you. I feel\nhow little I really mean to you.\"\n\n\"But Severin--\"\n\n\"But it is so,\" said I, \"and just for that reason--\"\n\n\"For that reason you would--\" she smiled roguishly--\"have I guessed\nit?\"\n\n\"Be your slave!\" I exclaimed. \"Be your unrestricted property,\nwithout a will of my own, of which you could dispose as you wished,\nand which would therefore never be a burden to you. While you drink\nlife at its fullness, while surrounded by luxury, you enjoy the\nserene happiness and Olympian love, I want to be your servant, put\non and take off your shoes.\"\n\n\"You really aren't so far from wrong,\" replied Wanda, \"for only as\nmy slave could you endure my loving others. Furthermore the freedom\nof enjoyment of the ancient world is unthinkable without slavery. It\nmust give one a feeling of like unto a god to see a man kneel before\none and tremble. I want a slave, do you hear, Severin?\"\n\n\"Am I not your slave?\"\n\n\"Then listen to me,\" said Wanda excitedly, seizing my hand. \"I want\nto be yours, as long as I love you.\"\n\n\"A month?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, even two.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then you become my slave.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I? Why do you ask? I am a goddess and sometimes I descend from my\nOlympian heights to you, softly, very softly, and secretly.\n\n\"But what does all this mean,\" said Wanda, resting her head in both\nhands with her gaze lost in the distance, \"a golden fancy which never\ncan become true.\" An uncanny brooding melancholy seemed shed over her\nentire being; I have never seen her like that.\n\n\"Why unachievable?\" I began.\n\n\"Because slavery doesn't exist any longer.\"\n\n\"Then we will go to a country where it still exists, to the Orient,\nto Turkey,\" I said eagerly.\n\n\"You would--Severin--in all seriousness,\" Wanda replied. Her eyes\nburned.\n\n\"Yes, in all seriousness, I want to be your slave,\" I continued. \"I\nwant your power over me to be sanctified by law; I want my life to\nbe in your hands, I want nothing that could protect or save me from\nyou. Oh, what a voluptuous joy when once I feel myself entirely dependent\nupon your absolute will, your whim, at your beck and call. And then\nwhat happiness, when at some time you deign to be gracious, and the\nslave may kiss the lips which mean life and death to him.\" I knelt\ndown, and leaned my burning forehead against her knee.\n\n\"You are talking as in a fever,\" said Wanda agitatedly, \"and you\nreally love me so endlessly.\" She held me to her breast, and covered\nme with kisses.\n\n\"You really want it?\"\n\n\"I swear to you now by God and my honor, that I shall be your slave,\nwherever and whenever you wish it, as soon as you command,\" I\nexclaimed, hardly master of myself.\n\n\"And if I take you at your word?\" said Wanda.\n\n\"Please do!\"\n\n\"All this appeals to me,\" she said then. \"It is different from\nanything else--to know that a man who worships me, and whom I love\nwith all my heart, is so wholly mine, dependent on my will and\ncaprice, my possession and slave, while I--\"\n\nShe looked strangely at me.\n\n\"If I should become frightfully frivolous you are to blame,\" she\ncontinued. \"It almost seems as if you were afraid of me already, but\nyou have sworn.\"\n\n\"And I shall keep my oath.\"\n\n\"I shall see to that,\" she replied. \"I am beginning to enjoy it,\nand, heaven help me, we won't stick to fancies now. You shall become\nmy slave, and I--I shall try to be _Venus in Furs_.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI thought that at last I knew this woman, understood her, and now I\nsee I have to begin at the very beginning again. Only a little while\nago her reaction to my dreams was violently hostile, and now she\ntries to carry them into execution with the soberest seriousness.\n\nShe has drawn up a contract according to which I give my word of\nhonor and agree under oath to be her slave, as long as she wishes.\n\nWith her arm around my neck she reads this, unprecedented,\nincredible document to me. The end of each sentence she punctuates\nwith a kiss.\n\n\"But all the obligations in the contract are on my side,\" I said,\nteasing her.\n\n\"Of course,\" she replied with great seriousness, \"you cease to be my\nlover, and consequently I am released from all duties and obligations\ntowards you. You will have to look upon my favors as pure\nbenevolence. You no longer have any rights, and no longer can lay\nclaim to any. There can be no limit to my power over you. Remember,\nthat you won't be much better than a dog, or some inanimate object.\nYou will be mine, my plaything, which I can break to pieces, whenever\nI want an hour's amusement. You are nothing, I am everything. Do you\nunderstand?\" She laughed and kissed me again, and yet a sort of cold\nshiver ran through me.\n\n\"Won't you allow me a few conditions--\" I began.\n\n\"Conditions?\" She contracted her forehead. \"Ah! You are afraid\nalready, or perhaps you regret, but it is too late now. You have\nsworn, I have your word of honor. But let me hear them.\"\n\n\"First of all I should like to have it included in our contract,\nthat you will never completely leave me, and then that you will never\ngive me over to the mercies of any of your admirers--\"\n\n\"But Severin,\" exclaimed Wanda with her voice full of emotion and\nwith tears in her eyes, \"how can you imagine that I--and you, a man\nwho loves me so absolutely, who puts himself so entirely in my power--\"\nShe halted.\n\n\"No, no!\" I said, covering her hands with kisses. \"I don't fear\nanything from you that might dishonor me. Forgive me the ugly\nthought.\"\n\nWanda smiled happily, leaned her cheek against mine, and seemed to\nreflect.\n\n\"You have forgotten something,\" she whispered coquettishly, \"the\nmost important thing!\"\n\n\"A condition?\"\n\n\"Yes, that I must always wear my furs,\" exclaimed Wanda. \"But I\npromise you I'll do that anyhow because they give me a despotic\nfeeling. And I shall be very cruel to you, do you understand?\"\n\n\"Shall I sign the contract?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Wanda. \"I shall first add your conditions, and the\nactual signing won't occur until the proper time and place.\"\n\n\"In Constantinople?\"\n\n\"No. I have thought things over. What special value would there be\nin owning a slave where everyone owns slaves. What I want is to\n_have a slave, I alone,_ here in our civilized sober, Philistine\nworld, and a slave who submits helplessly to my power solely on\naccount of my beauty and personality, not because of law, of property\nrights, or compulsions. This attracts me. But at any rate we will go\nto a country where we are not known and where you can appear before\nthe world as my servant without embarrassment. Perhaps to Italy, to\nRome or Naples.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were sitting on Wanda's ottoman. She wore her ermine jacket, her\nhair was loose and fell like a lion's mane down her back. She clung\nto my lips, drawing my soul from my body. My head whirled, my blood\nbegan to seethe, my heart beat violently against hers.\n\n\"I want to be absolutely in your power, Wanda,\" I exclaimed\nsuddenly, seized by that frenzy of passion when I can scarcely think\nclearly or decide freely. \"I want to put myself absolutely at your\nmercy for good or evil without any condition, without any limit to\nyour power.\"\n\nWhile saying this I had slipped from the ottoman, and lay at her\nfeet looking up at her with drunken eyes.\n\n\"How beautiful you now are,\" she exclaimed, \"your eyes half-broken\nin ecstacy fill me with joy, carry me away. How wonderful your look\nwould be if you were being beaten to death, in the extreme agony. You\nhave the eye of a martyr.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nSometimes, nevertheless, I have an uneasy feeling about placing\nmyself so absolutely, so unconditionally into a woman's hands.\nSuppose she did abuse my passion, her power?\n\nWell, then I would experience what has occupied my imagination since\nmy childhood, what has always given me the feeling of seductive\nterror. A foolish apprehension! It will be a wanton game she will play\nwith me, nothing more. She loves me, and she is good, a noble\npersonality, incapable of a breach of faith. But it lies in her hands\n--_if she wants to she can._ What a temptation in this doubt, this\nfear!\n\nNow I understand Manon l'Escault and the poor chevalier, who, even\nin the pillory, while she was another man's mistress, still adored\nher.\n\nLove knows no virtue, no profit; it loves and forgives and suffers\neverything, because it must. It is not our judgment that leads us;\nit is neither the advantages nor the faults which we discover, that\nmake us abandon ourselves, or that repel us.\n\nIt is a sweet, soft, enigmatic power that drives us on. We cease to\nthink, to feel, to will; we let ourselves be carried away by it, and\nask not whither?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA Russian prince made his first appearance today on the promenade.\nHe aroused general interest on account of his athletic figure,\nmagnificent face, and splendid bearing. The women particularly gaped\nat him as though he were a wild animal, but he went his way gloomily\nwithout paying attention to any one. He was accompanied by two\nservants, one a negro, completely dressed in red satin, and the other\na Circassian in his full gleaming uniform. Suddenly he saw Wanda, and\nfixed his cold piercing look upon her; he even turned his head after\nher, and when she had passed, he stood still and followed her with\nhis eyes.\n\nAnd she--she veritably devoured him with her radiant green eyes--and\ndid everything possible to meet him again.\n\nThe cunning coquetry with which she walked, moved, and looked at\nhim, almost stifled me. On the way home I remarked about it. She knit\nher brows.\n\n\"What do you want,\" she said, \"the prince is a man whom I might\nlike, who even dazzles me, and I am free. I can do what I please--\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any longer--\" I stammered, frightened.\n\n\"I love only you,\" she replied, \"but I shall have the prince pay\ncourt to me.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Aren't you my slave?\" she said calmly. \"Am I not Venus, the cruel\nnorthern Venus in Furs?\"\n\nI was silent. I felt literally crushed by her words; her cold look\nentered my heart like a dagger.\n\n\"You will find out immediately the prince's name, residence, and\ncircumstances,\" she continued. \"Do you understand?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"No argument, obey!\" exclaimed Wanda, more sternly than I would have\nthought possible for her, \"and don't dare to enter my sight until you\ncan answer my questions.\"\n\nIt was not till afternoon that I could obtain the desired\ninformation for Wanda. She let me stand before her like a servant,\nwhile she leaned back in her arm-chair and listened to me, smiling.\nThen she nodded; she seemed to be satisfied.\n\n\"Bring me my footstool,\" she commanded shortly.\n\nI obeyed, and after having put it before her and having put her feet\non it, I remained kneeling.\n\n\"How will this end?\" I asked sadly after a short pause.\n\nShe broke into playful laughter. \"Why things haven't even begun yet.\"\n\n\"You are more heartless than I imagined,\" I replied, hurt.\n\n\"Severin,\" Wanda began earnestly. \"I haven't done anything yet, not\nthe slightest thing, and you are already calling me heartless. What\nwill happen when I begin to carry your dreams to their realization,\nwhen I shall lead a gay, free life and have a circle of admirers\nabout me, when I shall actually fulfil your ideal, tread you\nunderfoot and apply the lash?\"\n\n\"You take my dreams too seriously.\"\n\n\"Too seriously? I can't stop at make-believe, when once I begin,\"\nshe replied. \"You know I hate all play-acting and comedy. You have\nwished it. Was it my idea or yours? Did I persuade you or did you\ninflame my imagination? I am taking things seriously now.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I replied, caressingly, \"listen quietly to me. We love each\nother infinitely, we are very happy, will you sacrifice our entire\nfuture to a whim?\"\n\n\"It is no longer a whim,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked frightened.\n\n\"Something that was probably latent in me,\" she said quietly and\nthoughtfully. \"Perhaps it would never have come to light, if you had\nnot called it to life, and made it grow. Now that it has become a\npowerful impulse, fills my whole being, now that I enjoy it, now that\nI cannot and do not want to do otherwise, now you want to back out--\nyou--are you a man?\"\n\n\"Dear, sweet Wanda!\" I began to caress her, kiss her.\n\n\"Don't--you are not a man--\"\n\n\"And you,\" I flared up.\n\n\"I am stubborn,\" she said, \"you know that. I haven't a strong\nimagination, and like you I am weak in execution. But when I make up\nmy mind to do something, I carry it through, and the more certainly,\nthe more opposition I meet. Leave me alone!\"\n\nShe pushed me away, and got up.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I likewise rose, and stood facing her.\n\n\"Now you know what I am,\" she continued. \"Once more I warn you. You\nstill have the choice. I am not compelling you to be my slave.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I replied with emotion and tears filling my eyes, \"don't\nyou know how I love you?\"\n\nHer lips quivered contemptuously.\n\n\"You are mistaken, you make yourself out worse than you are; you are\ngood and noble by nature--\"\n\n\"What do you know about my nature,\" she interrupted vehemently, \"you\nwill get to know me as I am.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Decide, will you submit, unconditionally?\"\n\n\"And if I say no.\"\n\n\"Then--\"\n\nShe stepped close up to me, cold and contemptuous. As she stood\nbefore me now, the arms folded across her breast, with an evil smile\nabout her lips, she was in fact the despotic woman of my dreams. Her\nexpression seemed hard, and nothing lay in her eyes that promised\nkindness or mercy.\n\n\"Well--\" she said at last.\n\n\"You are angry,\" I cried, \"you will punish me.\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" she replied, \"I shall let you go. You are free. I am not\nholding you.\"\n\n\"Wanda--I, who love you so--\"\n\n\"Yes, you, my dear sir, you who adore me,\" she exclaimed\ncontemptuously, \"but who are a coward, a liar, and a breaker of\npromises. Leave me instantly--\"\n\n\"Wanda I--\"\n\n\"Wretch!\"\n\nMy blood rose in my heart. I threw myself down at her feet and began\nto cry.\n\n\"Tears, too!\" She began to laugh. Oh, this laughter was frightful.\n\"Leave me--I don't want to see you again.\"\n\n\"Oh my God!\" I cried, beside myself. \"I will do whatever you\ncommand, be your slave, a mere object with which you can do what you\nwill--only don't send me away--I can't bear it--I cannot live without\nyou.\" I embraced her knees, and covered her hand with kisses.\n\n\"Yes, you must be a slave, and feel the lash, for you are not a\nman,\" she said calmly. She said this to me with perfect composure,\nnot angrily, not even excitedly, and it was what hurt most. \"Now I\nknow you, your dog-like nature, that adores where it is kicked, and\nthe more, the more it is maltreated. Now I know you, and now you\nshall come to know me.\"\n\nShe walked up and down with long strides, while I remained crushed\non my knees; my head was hanging supine, tears flowed from my eyes.\n\n\"Come here,\" Wanda commanded harshly, sitting down on the ottoman.\nI obeyed her command, and sat down beside her. She looked at me\nsombrely, and then a light suddenly seemed to illuminate the interior\nof her eye. Smiling, she drew me toward her breast, and began to kiss\nthe tears out of my eyes.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe odd part of my situation is that I am like the bear in Lily's\npark. I can escape and don't want to; I am ready to endure everything\nas soon as she threatens to set me free.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIf only she would use the whip again. There is something uncanny in\nthe kindness with which she treats me. I seem like a little captive\nmouse with which a beautiful cat prettily plays. She is ready at any\nmoment to tear it to pieces, and my heart of a mouse threatens to\nburst.\n\nWhat are her intentions? What does she purpose to do with me?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seems she has completely forgotten the contract, my slavehood. Or\nwas it actually only stubbornness? And she gave up her whole plan as\nsoon as I no longer opposed her and submitted to her imperial whim?\n\nHow kind she is to me, how tender, how loving! We are spending\nmarvellously happy days.\n\nTo-day she had me read to her the scene between Faust and\nMephistopheles, in which the latter appears as a wandering scholar.\nHer glance hung on me with strange pleasure.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" she said when I had finished, \"how a man who\ncan read such great and beautiful thoughts with such expression, and\ninterpret them so clearly, concisely, and intelligently, can at the\nsame time be such a visionary and supersensual ninny as you are.\"\n\n\"Were you pleased,\" said I, and kissed her forehead.\n\nShe gently stroked my brow. \"I love you, Severin,\" she whispered. \"I\ndon't believe I could ever love any one more than you. Let us be\nsensible, what do you say?\"\n\nInstead of replying I folded her in my arms; a deep inward, yet\nvaguely sad happiness filled my breast, my eyes grew moist, and a\ntear fell upon her hand.\n\n\"How can you cry!\" she exclaimed, \"you are a child!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn a pleasure drive we met the Russian prince in his carriage. He\nseemed to be unpleasantly surprised to see me by Wanda's side, and\nlooked as if he wanted to pierce her through and through with his\nelectric gray eyes. She, however, did not seem to notice him. I felt\nat that moment like kneeling down before her and kissing her feet.\nShe let her glance glide over him indifferently as though he were an\ninanimate object, a tree, for instance, and turned to me with her\ngracious smile.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I said good-night to her to-day she seemed suddenly\nunaccountably distracted and moody. What was occupying her?\n\n\"I am sorry you are going,\" she said when I was already standing on\nthe threshold.\n\n\"It is entirely in your hands to shorten the hard period of my\ntrial, to cease tormenting me--\" I pleaded.\n\n\"Do you imagine that this compulsion isn't a torment for me, too,\"\nWanda interjected.\n\n\"Then end it,\" I exclaimed, embracing her, \"be my wife.\"\n\n\"_Never, Severin_,\" she said gently, but with great firmness.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nI was frightened in my innermost soul.\n\n\"_You are not the man for me._\"\n\nI looked at her, and slowly withdrew my arm which was still about\nher waist; then I left the room, and she--she did not call me back.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA sleepless night; I made countless decisions, only to toss them\naside again. In the morning I wrote her a letter in which I declared\nour relationship dissolved. My hand trembled when I put on the seal,\nand I burned my fingers.\n\nAs I went upstairs to hand it to the maid, my knees threatened to\ngive way.\n\nThe door opened, and Wanda thrust forth her head full of curling-papers.\n\n\"I haven't had my hair dressed yet,\" she said, smiling. \"What have\nyou there?\"\n\n\"A letter--\"\n\n\"For me?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Ah, you want to break with me,\" she exclaimed, mockingly.\n\n\"Didn't you tell me yesterday that I wasn't the man for you?\"\n\n_\"I repeat it now!\"_\n\n\"Very well, then.\" My whole body was trembling, my voice failed me,\nand I handed her the letter.\n\n\"Keep it,\" she said, measuring me coldly. \"You forget that is no\nlonger a question as to whether you satisfy me as a man; as a _slave_\nyou will doubtless do well enough.\"\n\n\"Madame!\" I exclaimed, aghast.\n\n\"That is what you will call me in the future,\" replied Wanda,\nthrowing back her head with a movement of unutterable contempt. \"Put\nyour affairs in order within the next twenty-four hours. The day\nafter to-morrow I shall start for Italy, and you will accompany me\nas my servant.\"\n\n\"Wanda--\"\n\n\"I forbid any sort of familiarity,\" she said, cutting my words short,\n\"likewise you are not to come in unless I call or ring for you, and\nyou are not to speak to me until you are spoken to. From now on your\nname is no longer Severin, but _Gregor_.\"\n\nI trembled with rage, and yet, unfortunately, I cannot deny it, I\nalso felt a strange pleasure and stimulation.\n\n\"But, madame, you know my circumstances,\" I began in my confusion.\n\"I am dependent on my father, and I doubt whether he will give me the\nlarge sum of money needed for this journey--\"\n\n\"That means you have no money, Gregor,\" said Wanda, delightedly, \"so\nmuch the better, you are then entirely dependent on me, and in fact\nmy slave.\"\n\n\"You don't consider,\" I tried to object, \"that as man of honor it is\nimpossible for me--\"\n\n\"I have indeed considered it,\" she replied almost with a tone of\ncommand. \"As a man of honor you must keep your oath and redeem your\npromise to follow me as slave whithersoever I demand and to obey\nwhatever I command. Now leave me, Gregor!\"\n\nI turned toward the door.\n\n\"Not yet--you may first kiss my hand.\" She held it out to me with a\ncertain proud indifference, and I the dilettante, the donkey, the\nmiserable slave pressed it with intense tenderness against my lips\nwhich were dry and hot with excitement.\n\nThere was another gracious nod of the head.\n\nThen I was dismissed.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThough it was late in the evening my light was still lit, and a fire\nwas burning in the large green stove. There were still many things\namong my letters and documents to be put in order. Autumn, as is\nusually the case with us, had fallen with all its power.\n\nSuddenly she knocked at my window with the handle of her whip.\n\nI opened and saw her standing outside in her ermine-lined jacket and\nin a high round Cossack cap of ermine of the kind which the great\nCatherine favored.\n\n\"Are you ready, Gregor?\" she asked darkly.\n\n\"Not yet, mistress,\" I replied.\n\n\"I like that word,\" she said then, \"you are always to call me\nmistress, do you understand? We leave here to-morrow morning at nine\no'clock. As far as the district capital you will be my companion and\nfriend, but from the moment that we enter the railway-coach you are\nmy slave, my servant. Now close the window, and open the door.\"\n\nAfter I had done as she had demanded, and after she had entered, she\nasked, contracting her brows ironically, \"well, how do you like me.\"\n\n\"Wanda, you--\"\n\n\"Who gave you permission?\" She gave me a blow with the whip.\n\n\"You are very beautiful, mistress.\"\n\nWanda smiled and sat down in the arm-chair. \"Kneel down--here beside\nmy chair.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"Kiss my hand.\"\n\nI seized her small cold hand and kissed it.\n\n\"And the mouth--\"\n\nIn a surge of passion I threw my arms around the beautiful cruel\nwoman, and covered her face, arms, and breast with glowing kisses.\nShe returned them with equal fervor--the eyelids closed as in a\ndream. It was after midnight when she left.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAt nine o'clock sharp in the morning everything was ready for departure,\nas she had ordered. We left the little Carpathian health-resort in a\ncomfortable light carriage. The most interesting drama of my life had\nreached a point of development whose denouement it was then impossible\nto foretell.\n\nSo far everything went well. I sat beside Wanda, and she chatted\nvery graciously and intelligently with me, as with a good friend,\nconcerning Italy, Pisemski's new novel, and Wagner's music. She wore\na sort of Amazonesque travelling-dress of black cloth with a short\njacket of the same material, set with dark fur. It fitted closely and\nshowed her figure to best advantage. Over it she wore dark furs. Her\nhair wound into an antique knot, lay beneath a small dark fur-hat\nfrom which a black veil hung. Wanda was in very good humor; she fed\nme candies, played with my hair, loosened my neck cloth and made a\npretty cockade of it; she covered my knees with her furs and\nstealthily pressed the fingers of my hand. When our Jewish driver\npersistently went on nodding to himself, she even gave me a kiss, and\nher cold lips had the fresh frosty fragrance of a young autumnal\nrose, which blossoms alone amid bare stalks and yellow leaves and\nupon whose calyx the first frost has hung tiny diamonds of ice.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWe are at the district capital. We get out at the railway station.\nWanda throws off her furs and places them over my arm, and goes\nto secure the tickets.\n\nWhen she returns she has completely changed.\n\n\"Here is your ticket, Gregor,\" she says in a tone which supercilious\nladies use to their servants.\n\n\"A third-class ticket,\" I reply with comic horror.\n\n\"Of course,\" she continues, \"but now be careful. You won't get on\nuntil I am settled in my compartment and don't need you any longer.\nAt each station you will hurry to my car and ask for my orders. Don't\nforget. And now give me my furs.\"\n\nAfter I had helped her into them, humbly like a slave, she went to\nfind an empty first-class coupe. I followed. Supporting herself on\nmy shoulder, she got on and I wrapped her feet in bear-skins and placed\nthem on the warming bottle.\n\nThen she nodded to me, and dismissed me. I slowly ascended a third-class\ncarriage, which was filled with abominable tobacco-smoke that seemed\nlike the fogs of Acheron at the entrance to Hades. I now had the leisure\nto muse about the riddle of human existence, and about its greatest\nriddle of all--_woman_.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhenever the train stops, I jump off, run to her carriage, and with\ndrawn cap await her orders. She wants coffee and then a glass of\nwater, at another time a bowl of warm water to wash her hands, and\nthus it goes on. She lets several men who have entered her\ncompartment pay court to her. I am dying of jealousy and have to leap\nabout like an antelope so as to secure what she wants quickly and\nnot miss the train.\n\nIn this way the night passes. I haven't had time to eat a mouthful\nand I can't sleep, I have to breathe the same oniony air with Polish\npeasants, Jewish peddlers, and common soldiers.\n\nWhen I mount the steps of her coupe, she is lying stretched out\non cushions in her comfortable furs, covered up with the skins of\nanimals. She is like an oriental despot, and the men sit like Indian\ndeities, straight upright against the walls and scarcely dare to\nbreathe.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stops over in Vienna for a day to go shopping, and particularly\nto buy series of luxurious gowns. She continues to treat me as her\nservant. I follow her at the respectful distance of ten paces. She\nhands me her packages without so much as even deigning a kind look,\nand laden down like a donkey I pant along behind.\n\nBefore leaving she takes all my clothes and gives them to the hotel\nwaiters. I am ordered to put on her livery. It is a Cracovian costume\nin her colors, light-blue with red facings, and red quadrangular cap,\nornamented with peacock-feathers. The costume is rather becoming to\nme.\n\nThe silver buttons bear her coat of arms. I have the feeling of having\nbeen sold or of having bonded myself to the devil. My fair demon leads\nme from Vienna to Florence. Instead of linen-garbed Mazovians and\ngreasy-haired Jews, my companions now are curly-haired Contadini, a\nmagnificent sergeant of the first Italian Grenadiers, and a poor German\npainter. The tobacco smoke no longer smells of onions, but of salami and\ncheese.\n\nNight has fallen again. I lie on my wooden bed as on a rack; my arms and\nlegs seem broken. But there nevertheless is an element of poetry in the\naffair. The stars sparkle round about, the Italian sergeant has a face\nlike Apollo Belvedere, and the German painter sings a lovely German\nsong.\n\n\"Now that all the shadows gather\nAnd endless stars grow light,\nDeep yearning on me falls\nAnd softly fills the night.\"\n\n\"Through the sea of dreams\nSailing without cease,\nSailing goes my soul\nIn thine to find release.\"\n\nAnd I am thinking of the beautiful woman who is sleeping in regal\ncomfort among her soft furs.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFlorence! Crowds, cries, importunate porters and cab-drivers. Wanda\nchooses a carriage, and dismisses the porters.\n\n\"What have I a servant for,\" she says, \"Gregor--here is the ticket--\nget the luggage.\"\n\nShe wraps herself in her furs and sits quietly in the carriage while I\ndrag the heavy trunks hither, one after another. I break down for a\nmoment under the last one; a good-natured _carabiniere_ with an\nintelligent face comes to my assistance. She laughs.\n\n\"It must be heavy,\" said she, \"all my furs are in it.\"\n\nI get up on the driver's seat, wiping drops of perspiration from my\nbrow. She gives the name of the hotel, and the driver urges on his\nhorse. In a few minutes we halt at the brilliantly illuminated\nentrance.\n\n\"Have you any rooms?\" she asks the portier.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"Two for me, one for my servant, all with stoves.\"\n\n\"Two first-class rooms for you, madame, both with stoves,\" replied\nthe waiter who had hastily come up, \"and one without heat for your\nservant.\"\n\nShe looked at them, and then abruptly said: \"they are satisfactory,\nhave fires built at once; my servant can sleep in the unheated room.\"\n\nI merely looked at her.\n\n\"Bring up the trunks, Gregor,\" she commands, paying no attention to\nmy looks. \"In the meantime I'll be dressing, and then will go down\nto the dining-room, and you can eat something for supper.\"\n\nAs she goes into the adjoining room, I drag the trunks upstairs and\nhelp the waiter build a fire in her bed-room. He tries to question\nme in bad French about my employer. With a brief glance I see the\nblazing fire, the fragrant white poster-bed, and the rugs which cover\nthe floor. Tired and hungry I then descend the stairs, and ask for\nsomething to eat. A good-natured waiter, who used to be in the\nAustrian army and takes all sorts of pains to entertain me in German,\nshows me the dining-room and waits on me. I have just had the first\nfresh drink in thirty-six hours and the first bite of warm food on\nmy fork, when she enters.\n\nI rise.\n\n\"What do you mean by taking me into a dining-room in which my\nservant is eating,\" she snaps at the waiter, flaring with anger. She\nturns around and leaves.\n\nMeanwhile I thank heaven that I am permitted to go on eating. Later\nI climb the four flights upstairs to my room. My small trunk is\nalready there, and a miserable little oil-lamp is burning. It is a\nnarrow room without fire-place, without a window, but with a small\nair-hole. If it weren't so beastly cold, it would remind me of one\nof the Venetian _piombi_. [Footnote: These were notorious prisons\nunder the leaden roof of the Palace of the Doges.] Involuntarily I\nhave to laugh out aloud, so that it re-echoes, and I am startled by\nmy own laughter.\n\nSuddenly the door is pulled open and the waiter with a theatrical\nItalian gesture calls \"You are to come down to madame, at once.\" I\npick up my cap, stumble down the first few steps, but finally arrive\nin front of her door on the first floor and knock.\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nI enter, shut the door, and stand attention.\n\nWanda has made herself comfortable. She is sitting in a neglige of\nwhite muslin and laces on a small red divan with her feet on a\nfootstool that matches. She has thrown her fur-cloak about her. It\nis the identical cloak in which she appeared to me for the first time,\nas goddess of love.\n\nThe yellow lights of the candelabra which stand on projections,\ntheir reflections in the large mirrors, and the red flames from the\nopen fireplace play beautifully on the green velvet, the dark-brown\nsable of the cloak, the smooth white skin, and the red, flaming hair\nof the beautiful woman. Her clear, but cold face is turned toward me,\nand her cold green eyes rest upon me.\n\n\"I am satisfied with you, Gregor,\" she began.\n\nI bowed.\n\n\"Come closer.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"Still closer,\" she looked down, and stroked the sable with her\nhand. \"Venus in Furs receives her slave. I can see that you are more\nthan an ordinary dreamer, you don't remain far in arrears of your\ndreams; you are the sort of man who is ready to carry his dreams into\neffect, no matter how mad they are. I confess, I like this; it\nimpresses me. There is strength in this, and strength is the only\nthing one respects. I actually believe that under unusual\ncircumstances, in a period of great deeds, what seems to be your\nweakness would reveal itself as extraordinary power. Under the early\nemperors you would have been a martyr, at the time of the Reformation\nan anabaptist, during the French Revolution one of those inspired\nGirondists who mounted the guillotine with the marseillaise on their\nlips. But you are my slave, my--\"\n\nShe suddenly leaped up; the furs slipped down, and she threw her\narms with soft pressure about my neck.\n\n\"My beloved slave, Severin, oh, how I love you, how I adore you, how\nhandsome you are in your Cracovian costume! You will be cold to-night\nup in your wretched room without a fire. Shall I give you one of my\nfurs, dear heart, the large one there--\"\n\nShe quickly picked it up, throwing it over my shoulders, and before\nI knew what had happened I was completely wrapped up in it.\n\n\"How wonderfully becoming furs are to your face, they bring out your\nnoble lines. As soon as you cease being my slave, you must wear a\nvelvet coat with sable, do you understand? Otherwise I shall never\nput on my fur-jacket again.\"\n\nAnd again she began to caress me and kiss me; finally she drew me\ndown on the little divan.\n\n\"You seem to be pleased with yourself in furs,\" she said. \"Quick,\nquick, give them to me, or I will lose all sense of dignity.\"\n\nI placed the furs about her, and Wanda slipped her right arm into\nthe sleeve.\n\n\"This is the pose in Titian's picture. But now enough of joking.\nDon't always look so solemn, it makes me feel sad. As far as the\nworld is concerned you are still merely my servant; you are not yet\nmy slave, for you have not yet signed the contract. You are still\nfree, and can leave me any moment. You have played your part\nmagnificently. I have been delighted, but aren't you tired of it\nalready, and don't you think I am abominable? Well, say something--I\ncommand it.\"\n\n\"Must I confess to you, Wanda?\" I began.\n\n\"Yes, you must.\"\n\n\"Even it you take advantage of it,\" I continued, \"I shall love you\nthe more deeply, adore you the more fanatically, the worse you treat\nme. What you have just done inflames my blood and intoxicates all my\nsenses.\" I held her close to me and clung for several moments to her\nmoist lips.\n\n\"Oh, you beautiful woman,\" I then exclaimed, looking at her. In my\nenthusiasm I tore the sable from her shoulders and pressed my mouth\nagainst her neck.\n\n\"You love me even when I am cruel,\" said Wanda, \"now go!--you bore\nme--don't you hear?\"\n\nShe boxed my ears so that I saw stars and bells rang in my ears.\n\n\"Help me into my furs, slave.\"\n\nI helped her, as well as I could.\n\n\"How awkward,\" she exclaimed, and was scarcely in it before she\nstruck me in the face again. I felt myself growing pale.\n\n\"Did I hurt you?\" she asked, softly touching me with her hand.\n\n\"No, no,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"At any rate you have no reason to complain, you want it thus; now\nkiss me again.\"\n\nI threw my arms about her, and her lips clung closely to mine. As\nshe lay against my breast in her large heavy furs, I had a curiously\noppressive sensation. It was as if a wild beast, a she-bear, were\nembracing me. It seemed as if I were about to feel her claws in my\nflesh. But this time the she-bear let me off easily.\n\nWith my heart filled with smiling hopes, I went up to my miserable\nservant's room, and threw myself down on my hard couch.\n\n\"Life is really amazingly droll,\" I thought. \"A short time ago the\nmost beautiful woman, Venus herself, rested against your breast, and\nnow you have an opportunity for studying the Chinese hell. Unlike us,\nthey don't hurl the damned into flames, but they have devils chasing\nthem out into fields of ice.\n\n\"Very likely the founders of their religion also slept in unheated\nrooms.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the night I startled out of my sleep with a scream. I had\nbeen dreaming of an icefield in which I had lost my way; I had been\nlooking in vain for a way out. Suddenly an eskimo drove up in a\nsleigh harnessed with reindeer; he had the face of the waiter who had\nshown me to the unheated room.\n\n\"What are you looking for here, my dear sir?\" he exclaimed. \"This is\nthe North Pole.\"\n\nA moment later he had disappeared, and Wanda flew over the smooth\nice on tiny skates. Her white satin skirt fluttered and crackled; the\nermine of her jacket and cap, but especially her face, gleamed whiter\nthan the snow. She shot toward me, inclosed me in her arms, and began\nto kiss me. Suddenly I felt my blood running warm down my side.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked horror-stricken.\n\nShe laughed, and as I looked at her now, it was no longer Wanda, but\na huge, white she-bear, who was digging her paws into my body.\n\nI cried out in despair, and still heard her diabolical laughter when\nI awoke, and looked about the room in surprise.\n\nEarly in the morning I stood at Wanda's door, and the waiter brought\nthe coffee. I took it from him, and served it to my beautiful\nmistress. She had already dressed, and looked magnificent, all fresh\nand roseate. She smiled graciously at me and called me back, when I\nwas about to withdraw respectfully.\n\n\"Come, Gregor, have your breakfast quickly too,\" she said, \"then we\nwill go house-hunting. I don't want to stay in the hotel any longer\nthan I have to. It is very embarassing here. If I chat with you for\nmore than a minute, people will immediately say: 'The fair Russian\nis having an affair with her servant, you see, the race of Catherines\nisn't extinct yet.'\"\n\nHalf an hour later we went out; Wanda was in her cloth-gown with the\nRussian cap, and I in my Cracovian costume. We created quite a stir. I\nwalked about ten paces behind, looking very solemn, but expected\nmomentarily to have to break out into loud laughter. There was scarcely\na street in which one or the other of the attractive houses did not bear\nthe sign _camere ammobiliate_. Wanda always sent me upstairs, and only\nwhen the apartment seemed to answer her requirements did she herself\nascend. By noon I was as tired as a stag-hound after the hunt.\n\nWe entered a new house and left it again without having found a suitable\nhabitation. Wanda was already somewhat out of humor. Suddenly she said\nto me: \"Severin, the seriousness with which you play your part is\ncharming, and the restrictions, which we have placed upon each other are\nreally annoying me. I can't stand it any longer, I do love you, I must\nkiss you. Let's go into one of the houses.\"\n\n\"But, my lady--\" I interposed.\n\n\"Gregor?\" She entered the next open corridor and ascended a few\nsteps of the dark stair-way; then she threw her arms about me with\npassionate tenderness and kissed me.\n\n\"Oh, Severin, you were very wise. You are much more dangerous as\nslave than I would have imagined; you are positively irrestible, and\nI am afraid I shall have to fall in love with you again.\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any longer then,\" I asked seized by a sudden\nfright.\n\nShe solemnly shook her head, but kissed me again with her swelling,\nadorable lips.\n\nWe returned to the hotel. Wanda had luncheon, and ordered me also\nquickly to get something to eat.\n\nOf course, I wasn't served as quickly as she, and so it happened\nthat just as I was carrying the second bite of my steak to my mouth,\nthe waiter entered and called out with his theatrical gesture:\n\"Madame wants you, at once.\"\n\nI took a rapid and painful leave of my food, and, tired and hungry,\nhurried toward Wanda, who was already on the street.\n\n\"I wouldn't have imagined you could be so cruel,\" I said\nreproachfully. \"With all these, fatiguing duties you don't even leave\nme time to eat in peace.\"\n\nWanda laughed gaily. \"I thought you had finished,\" she said, \"but\nnever mind. Man was born to suffer, and you in particular. The\nmartyrs didn't have any beefsteaks either.\"\n\nI followed her resentfully, gnawing at my hunger.\n\n\"I have given up the idea of finding a place in the city,\" Wanda\ncontinued. \"It will be difficult to find an entire floor which is\nshut off and where you can do as you please. In such a strange, mad\nrelationship as ours there must be no jarring note. I shall rent an\nentire villa--and you will be surprised. You have my permission now\nto satisfy your hunger, and look about a bit in Florence. I won't be\nhome till evening. If I need you then, I will have you called.\"\n\nI looked at the Duomo, the Palazzo Vecchio, the Logia di Lanzi, and\nthen I stood for a long time on the banks of the Arno. Again and\nagain I let my eyes rest on the magnificent ancient Florence, whose\nround cupolas and towers were drawn in soft lines against the blue,\ncloudless sky. I watched its splendid bridges beneath whose wide\narches the lively waves of the beautiful, yellow river ran, and the\ngreen hills which surrounded the city, bearing slender cypresses and\nextensive buildings, palaces and monasteries.\n\nIt is a different world, this one in which we are--a gay, sensuous,\nsmiling world. The landscape too has nothing of the seriousness and\nsomberness of ours. It is a long ways off to the last white villas\nscattered among the pale green of the mountains, and yet there isn't\na spot that isn't bright with sunlight. The people are less serious\nthan we; perhaps, they think less, but they all look as though they\nwere happy.\n\nIt is also maintained that death is easier in the South.\n\nI have a vague feeling now that such a thing as beauty without thorn\nand love of the senses without torment does exist.\n\nWanda has discovered a delightful little villa and rented it for the\nwinter. It is situated on a charming hill on the left bank of the\nArno, opposite the Cascine. It is surrounded by an attractive garden\nwith lovely paths, grass plots, and magnificent meadow of camelias.\nIt is only two stories high, quadrangular in the Italian fashion. An\nopen gallery runs along one side, a sort of loggia with plaster-casts\nof antique statues; stone steps lead from it down into the garden.\nFrom the gallery you enter a bath with a magnificent marble basin,\nfrom which winding stairs lead to my mistress' bed-chamber.\n\nWanda occupies the second story by herself.\n\nA room on the ground floor has been assigned to me; it is very\nattractive, and even has a fireplace.\n\nI have roamed through the garden. On a round hillock I discovered a\nlittle temple, but I found its door locked. However, there is a chink\nin the door and when I glue my eye to it, I see the goddess of love\non a white pedestal.\n\nA slight shudder passes over me. It seems to me as if she were\nsmiling at me saying: \"Are you there? I have been expecting you.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is evening. An attractive maid brings me orders to appear before\nmy mistress. I ascend the wide marble stairs, pass through the\nanteroom, a large salon furnished with extravagant magnificence, and\nknock at the door of the bedroom. I knock very softly for the luxury\ndisplayed everywhere intimidates me. Consequently no one hears me,\nand I stand for some time in front of the door. I have a feeling as\nif I were standing before the bed-room of the great Catherine, and\nit seems as if at any moment she might come out in her green sleeping\nfurs, with the red ribbon and decoration on her bare breast, and with\nher little white powdered curls.\n\nI knocked again. Wanda impatiently pulls the door open.\n\n\"Why so late?\" she asks.\n\n\"I was standing in front of the door, but you didn't hear me knock,\"\nI reply timidly. She closes the door, and clinging to me, she leads\nme to the red damask ottoman on which she had been resting. The\nentire arrangement of the room is in red damask--wall-paper,\ncurtains, portieres, hangings of the bed. A magnificent painting of\nSamson and Delilah forms the ceiling.\n\nWanda receives me in an intoxicating dishabille. Her white satin\ndress flows gracefully and picturesquely down her slender body,\nleaving her arms and breast bare, and carelessly they nestle amid the\ndark hair of the great fur of sable, lined with green velvet. Her red\nhair falls down her back as far as the hips, only half held by\nstrings of black pearls.\n\n\"Venus in Furs,\" I whisper, while she draws me to her breast and\nthreatens to stifle me with her kisses. Then I no longer speak and\nneither do I think; everything is drowned out in an ocean of\nunimagined bliss.\n\n\"Do you still love me?\" she asks, her eye softening in passionate\ntenderness.\n\n\"You ask!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"You still remember your oath,\" she continued with an alluring\nsmile, \"now that everything is prepared, everything in readiness, I\nask you once more, is it still your serious wish to become my slave?\"\n\n\"Am I not ready?\" I asked in surprise.\n\n\"You have not yet signed the papers.\"\n\n\"Papers--what papers?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see, you want to give it up,\" she said, \"well then, we will\nlet it go.\"\n\n\"But Wanda,\" I said, \"you know that nothing gives me greater\nhappiness than to serve you, to be your slave. I would give\neverything for the sake of feeling myself wholly in your power, even\nunto death--\"\n\n\"How beautiful you are,\" she whispered, \"when you speak so\nenthusiastically, so passionately. I am more in love with you than\never and you want me to be dominant, stern, and cruel. I am afraid,\nit will be impossible for me to be so.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" I replied smiling, \"where are the papers?'\"\n\n\"So that you may know what it means to be absolutely in my power, I\nhave drafted a second agreement in which you declare that you have\ndecided to kill yourself. In that way I can even kill you, if I so\ndesire.\"\n\n\"Give them to me.\"\n\nWhile I was unfolding the documents and reading them, Wanda got pen\nand ink. She then sat down beside me with her arm about my neck, and\nlooked over my shoulder at the paper.\n\nThe first one read:\n\nAGREEMENT BETWEEN MME. VON DUNAJEW AND SEVERIN VON KUSIEMSKI\n\n\"Severin von Kusiemski ceases with the present day being the affianced\nof Mme. Wanda von Dunajew, and renounces all the rights appertaining\nthereunto; he on the contrary binds himself on his word of honor as a\nman and nobleman, that hereafter he will be her _slave_ until such\ntime that she herself sets him at liberty again.\n\n\"As the slave of Mme. von Dunajew he is to bear the name Gregor, and\nhe is unconditionally to comply with every one of her wishes, and to\nobey every one of her commands; he is always to be submissive to his\nmistress, and is to consider her every sign of favor as an\nextraordinary mercy.\n\n\"Mme. von Dunajew is entitled not only to punish her slave as she\ndeems best, even for the slightest inadvertence or fault, but also\nis herewith given the right to torture him as the mood may seize her\nor merely for the sake of whiling away the time. Should she so desire,\nshe may kill him whenever she wishes; in short, he is her\nunrestricted property.\n\n\"Should Mme. von Dunajew ever set her slave at liberty, Severin von\nKusiemski agrees to forget everything that he has experienced or\nsuffered as her slave, and promises _never under any circumstances and\nin no wise to think of vengeance or retaliation_.\n\n\"Mme. von Dunajew on her behalf agrees as his mistress to appear as\noften as possible in her furs, especially when she purposes some\ncruelty toward her slave.\"\n\nAppended at the bottom of the agreement was the date of the present\nday.\n\nThe second document contained only a few words.\n\n\"Having since many years become weary of existence and its\nillusions, I have of my own free will put an end to my worthless\nlife.\"\n\nI was seized with a deep horror when I had finished. There was still\ntime, I could still withdraw, but the madness of passion and the\nsight of the beautiful woman that lay all relaxed against my shoulder\ncarried me away.\n\n\"This one you will have to copy, Severin,\" said Wanda, indicating\nthe second document. \"It has to be entirely in your own handwriting;\nthis, of course, isn't necessary in the case of the agreement.\"\n\nI quickly copied the few lines in which I designated myself a\nsuicide, and handed them to Wanda. She read them, and put them on the\ntable with a smile.\n\n\"Now have you the courage to sign it?\" she asked with a crafty\nsmile, inclining her head.\n\nI took the pen.\n\n\"Let me sign first,\" said Wanda, \"your hand is trembling, are you\nafraid of the happiness that is to be yours?\"\n\nShe took the agreement and pen. While engaging in my internal struggle,\nI looked upward for a moment. It occurred to me that the painting on the\nceiling, like many of those of the Italian and Dutch schools, was\nutterly unhistorical, but this very fact gave it a strange mood which\nhad an almost uncanny effect on me. Delilah, an opulent woman with\nflaming red hair, lay extended, half-disrobed, in a dark fur-cloak, upon\na red ottoman, and bent smiling over Samson who had been overthrown and\nbound by the Philistines. Her smile in its mocking coquetry was full of\na diabolical cruelty; her eyes, half-closed, met Samson's, and his with\na last look of insane passion cling to hers, for already one of his\nenemies is kneeling on his breast with the red-hot iron to blind him.\n\n\"Now--\" said Wanda. \"Why you are all lost in thought. What is the\nmatter with you, everything will remain just as it was, even after\nyou have signed, don't you know me yet, dear heart?\"\n\nI looked at the agreement. Her name was written there in bold\nletters. I peered once more into her eyes with their potent magic,\nthen I took the pen and quickly signed the agreement.\n\n\"You are trembling,\" said Wanda calmly, \"shall I help you?\"\n\nShe gently took hold of my hand, and my name appeared at the bottom\nof the second paper. Wanda looked once more at the two documents, and\nthen locked them in the desk which stood at the head of the ottoman.\n\n\"Now then, give me your passport and money.\"\n\nI took out my wallet and handed it to her. She inspected it, nodded,\nand put it with other things while in a sweet drunkenness I kneeled\nbefore her leaning my head against her breast.\n\nSuddenly she thrusts me away with her foot, leaps up, and pulls the\nbell-rope. In answer to its sound three young, slender negresses\nenter; they are as if carved of ebony, and are dressed from head to\nfoot in red satin; each one has a rope in her hand.\n\nSuddenly I realize my position, and am about to rise. Wanda stands\nproudly erect, her cold beautiful face with its sombre brows and\ncontemptous eyes is turned toward me. She stands before me as\nmistress, commanding, gives a sign with her hand, and before I really\nknow what has happened to me the negresses have dragged me to the\nground, and have tied me hand and foot. As in the case of one about\nto be executed my arms are bound behind my back, so that I can\nscarcely move.\n\n\"Give me the whip, Haydee,\" commands Wanda, with unearthly calm.\n\nThe negress hands it to her mistress, kneeling.\n\n\"And now take off my heavy furs,\" she continues, \"they impede me.\"\n\nThe negress obeyed.\n\n\"The jacket there!\" Wanda commanded.\n\nHaydee quickly brought her the _kazabaika_, set with ermine, which lay\non the bed, and Wanda slipped into it with two inimitably graceful\nmovements.\n\n\"Now tie him to the pillar here!\"\n\nThe negresses lifted me up, and twisting a heavy rope around my\nbody, tied me standing against one of the massive pillars which\nsupported the top of the wide Italian bed.\n\nThen they suddenly disappeared, as if the earth had swallowed them.\n\nWanda swiftly approached me. Her white satin dress flowed behind her\nin a long train, like silver, like moonlight; her hair flared like\nflames against the white fur of her jacket. Now she stood in front\nof me with her left hand firmly planted on her hips, in her right hand\nshe held the whip. She uttered an abrupt laugh.\n\n\"Now play has come to an end between us,\" she said with heartless\ncoldness. \"Now we will begin in dead earnest. You fool, I laugh at you\nand despise you; you who in your insane infatuation have given\nyourself as a plaything to _me_, the frivolous and capricious woman.\nYou are no longer the man I love, but _my slave_, at my mercy even\nunto life and death.\n\n\"You shall know me!\n\n\"First of all you shall have a taste of the whip in all seriousness,\nwithout having done anything to deserve it, so that you may\nunderstand what to expect, if you are awkward, disobedient, or\nrefractory.\"\n\nWith a wild grace she rolled back her fur-lined sleeve, and struck\nme across the back.\n\nI winced, for the whip cut like a knife into my flesh.\n\n\"Well, how do you like that?\" she exclaimed.\n\nI was silent.\n\n\"Just wait, you will yet whine like a dog beneath my whip,\" she\nthreatened, and simultaneously began to strike me again.\n\nThe blows fell quickly, in rapid succession, with terrific force\nupon my back, arms, and neck; I had to grit my teeth not to scream\naloud. Now she struck me in the face, warm blood ran down, but she\nlaughed, and continued her blows.\n\n\"It is only now I understand you,\" she exclaimed. \"It really is a\njoy to have some one so completely in one's power, and a man at that,\nwho loves you--you do love me?--No--Oh! I'll tear you to shreds yet,\nand with each blow my pleasure will grow. Now, twist like a worm,\nscream, whine! You will find no mercy in me!\"\n\nFinally she seemed tired.\n\nShe tossed the whip aside, stretched out on the ottoman, and rang.\n\nThe negresses entered.\n\n\"Untie him!\"\n\nAs they loosened the rope, I fell to the floor like a lump of wood.\nThe black women grinned, showing their white teeth.\n\n\"Untie the rope around his feet.\"\n\nThey did it, but I was unable to rise.\n\n\"Come over here, Gregor.\"\n\nI approached the beautiful woman. Never did she seem more seductive\nto me than to-day in spite of all her cruelty and contempt.\n\n\"One step further,\" Wanda commanded. \"Now kneel down, and kiss my\nfoot.\"\n\nShe extended her foot beyond the hem of white satin, and I, the\nsupersensual fool, pressed my lips upon it.\n\n\"Now, you won't lay eyes on me for an entire month, Gregor,\" she\nsaid seriously. \"I want to become a stranger to you, so you will more\neasily adjust yourself to our new relationship. In the meantime you\nwill work in the garden, and await my orders. Now, off with you,\nslave!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA month has passed with monotonous regularity, heavy work, and a\nmelancholy hunger, hunger for her, who is inflicting all these\ntorments on me.\n\nI am under the gardener's orders; I help him lop the trees and prune\nthe hedges, transplant flowers, turn over the flower beds, sweep the\ngravel paths; I share his coarse food and his hard cot; I rise and\ngo to bed with the chickens. Now and then I hear that our mistress\nis amusing herself, surrounded by admirers. Once I heard her gay\nlaughter even down here in the garden.\n\nI seem awfully stupid to myself. Was it the result of my present\nlife, or was I so before? The month is drawing to a close--the day\nafter to-morrow. What will she do with me now, or has she forgotten\nme, and left me to trim hedges and bind bouquets till my dying day?\n\nA written order.\n\n\"The slave Gregor is herewith ordered to my personal service.\n\nWanda Dunajew.\"\n\nWith a beating heart I draw aside the damask curtain on the\nfollowing morning, and enter the bed-room of my divinity. It is still\nfilled with a pleasant half darkness.\n\n\"Is it you, Gregor?\" she asks, while I kneel before the fire-place,\nbuilding a fire. I tremble at the sound of the beloved voice. I\ncannot see her herself; she is invisible behind the curtains of the\nfour-poster bed.\n\n\"Yes, my mistress,\" I reply.\n\n\"How late is it?\"\n\n\"Past nine o'clock.\"\n\n\"Breakfast.\"\n\nI hasten to get it, and then kneel down with the tray beside her bed.\n\n\"Here is breakfast, my mistress.\"\n\nWanda draws back the curtains, and curiously enough at the first\nglance when I see her among the pillows with loosened flowing hair,\nshe seems an absolute stranger, a beautiful woman, but the beloved\nsoft lines are gone. This face is hard and has an expression of\nweariness and satiety.\n\nOr is it simply that formerly my eye did not see this?\n\nShe fixes her green eyes upon me, more with curiosity than with\nmenace, perhaps even somewhat pityingly, and lazily pulls the dark\nsleeping fur on which she lies over the bared shoulder.\n\nAt this moment she is very charming, very maddening, and I feel my\nblood rising to my head and heart. The tray in my hands begins to\nsway. She notices it and reached out for the whip which is lying on\nthe toilet-table.\n\n\"You are awkward, slave,\" she says furrowing her brow.\n\nI lower my looks to the ground, and hold the tray as steadily as\npossible. She eats her breakfast, yawns, and stretches her opulent\nlimbs in the magnificent furs.\n\nShe has rung. I enter.\n\n\"Take this letter to Prince Corsini.\"\n\nI hurry into the city, and hand the letter to the Prince. He is a\nhandsome young man with glowing black eyes. Consumed with jealousy,\nI take his answer to her.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" she asks with lurking spitefulness.\n\"You are very pale.\"\n\n\"Nothing, mistress, I merely walked rather fast.\"\n\nAt luncheon the prince is at her side, and I am condemned to serve\nboth her and him. They joke, and I am, as if non-existent, for both.\nFor a brief moment I see black; I was just pouring some Bordeaux into\nhis glass, and spilled it over the table-cloth and her gown.\n\n\"How awkward,\" Wanda exclaimed and slapped my face. The prince\nlaughed, and she also, but I felt the blood rising to my face.\n\nAfter luncheon she drove in the Cascine. She has a little carriage\nwith a handsome, brown English horse, and holds the reins herself.\nI sit behind and notice how coquettishly she acts, and nods with a\nsmile when one of the distinguished gentlemen bows to her.\n\nAs I help her out of the carriage, she leans lightly on my arm; the\ncontact runs through me like an electric shock. She _is_ a wonderful\nwoman, and I love her more than ever.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor dinner at six she has invited a small group of men and women. I\nserve, but this time I do not spill any wine over the table-cloth.\n\nA slap in the face is more effective than ten lectures. It makes you\nunderstand very quickly, especially when the instruction is by the\nway of a small woman's hand.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter dinner she drives to the Pergola Theater. As she descends the\nstairs in her black velvet dress with its large collar of ermine and\nwith a diadem of white roses on her hair, she is literally stunning.\nI open the carriage-door, and help her in. In front of the theater\nI leap from the driver's seat, and in alighting she leaned on my arm,\nwhich trembled under the sweet burden. I open the door of her box,\nand then wait in the vestibule. The performance lasts four hours; she\nreceives visits from her cavaliers, the while I grit my teeth with\nrage.\n\nIt is way beyond midnight when my mistress's bell sounds for the\nlast time.\n\n\"Fire!\" she orders abruptly, and when the fire-place crackles, \"Tea!\"\n\nWhen I return with the samovar, she has already undressed, and with\nthe aid of the negress slipped into a white negligee.\n\nHaydee thereupon leaves.\n\n\"Hand me the sleeping-furs,\" says Wanda, sleepily stretching her\nlovely limbs. I take them from the arm-chair, and hold them while she\nslowly and lazily slides into the sleeves. She then throws herself\ndown on the cushions of the ottoman.\n\n\"Take off my shoes, and put on my velvet slippers.\"\n\nI kneel down and tug at the little shoe which resists my efforts.\n\"Hurry, hurry!\" Wanda exclaims, \"you are hurting me! just you wait--I\nwill teach you.\" She strikes me with the whip, but now the shoe is\noff.\n\n\"Now get out!\" Still a kick--and then I can go to bed.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-night I accompanied her to a soiree. In the entrance-hall she\nordered me to help her out of her furs; then with a proud smile,\nconfident of victory, she entered the brilliantly illuminated room.\nI again waited with gloomy and monotonous thoughts, watching hour after\nhour run by. From time to time the sounds of music reached me, when\nthe door remained open for a moment. Several servants tried to start\na conversation with me, but soon desisted, since I knew only a few\nwords of Italian.\n\nFinally I fell asleep, and dreamed that I murdered Wanda in a\nviolent attack of jealousy. I was condemned to death, and saw myself\nstrapped on the board; the knife fell, I felt it on my neck, but I\nwas still alive--\n\nThen the executioner slapped my face.\n\nNo, it wasn't the executioner; it was Wanda who stood wrathfully\nbefore me demanding her furs. I am at her side in a moment, and help\nher on with it.\n\nThere is a deep joy in wrapping a beautiful woman into her furs, and\nin seeing and feeling how her neck and magnificent limbs nestle in\nthe precious soft furs, and to lift the flowing hair over the collar.\nWhen she throws it off a soft warmth and a faint fragrance of her\nbody still clings to the ends of the hairs of sable. It is enough to\ndrive one mad.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFinally a day came when there were neither guests, nor theater, nor\nother company. I breathed a sigh of relief. Wanda sat in the gallery,\nreading, and apparently had no orders for me. At dusk when the\nsilvery evening mists fell she withdrew. I served her at dinner, she\nate by herself, but had not a look, not a syllable for me, not even\na slap in the face.\n\nI actually desire a slap from her hand. Tears fill my eyes, and I\nfeel that she has humiliated me so deeply, that she doesn't even find\nit worth while to torture or maltreat me any further.\n\nBefore she goes to bed, her bell calls me.\n\n\"You will sleep here to-night, I had horrible dreams last night, and\nam afraid of being alone. Take one of the cushions from the ottoman,\nand lie down on the bearskin at my feet.\"\n\nThen Wanda put out the lights. The only illumination in the room was\nfrom a small lamp suspended from the ceiling. She herself got into\nbed. \"Don't stir, so as not to wake me.\"\n\nI did as she had commanded, but could not fall asleep for a long\ntime. I saw the beautiful woman, beautiful as a goddess, lying on her\nback on the dark sleeping-furs; her arms beneath her neck, with a\nflood of red hair over them. I heard her magnificent breast rise in\ndeep regular breathing, and whenever she moved ever so slightly. I\nwoke up and listened to see whether she needed me.\n\nBut she did not require me.\n\nNo task was required of me; I meant no more to her than a night-lamp, or\na revolver which one places under one's pillow.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAm I mad or is she? Does all this arise out of an inventive, wanton\nwoman's brain with the intention of surpassing my supersensual\nfantasies, or is this woman really one of those Neronian characters\nwho take a diabolical pleasure in treading underfoot, like a worm,\nhuman beings, who have thoughts and feelings and a will like theirs?\n\nWhat have I experienced?\n\nWhen I knelt with the coffee-tray beside her bed, Wanda suddenly\nplaced her hand on my shoulder and her eyes plunged deep into mine.\n\n\"What beautiful eyes you have,\" she said softly, \"and especially now\nsince you suffer. Are you very unhappy?\"\n\nI bowed my head, and kept silent.\n\n\"Severin, do you still love me,\" she suddenly exclaimed\npassionately, \"can you still love me?\"\n\nShe drew me close with such vehemence that the coffee-tray upset,\nthe can and cups fell to the floor, and the coffee ran over the\ncarpet.\n\n\"Wanda--my Wanda,\" I cried out and held her passionately against me;\nI covered her mouth, face, and breast with kisses.\n\n\"It is my unhappiness that I love you more and more madly the worse\nyou treat me, the more frequently you betray me. Oh, I shall die of\npain and love and jealousy.\"\n\n\"But I haven't betrayed you, as yet, Severin,\" replied Wanda smiling.\n\n\"Not? Wanda! Don't jest so mercilessly with me,\" I cried. \"Haven't\nI myself taken the letter to the Prince--\"\n\n\"Of course, it was an invitation for luncheon.\"\n\n\"You have, since we have been in Florence--\"\n\n\"I have been absolutely faithful to you,\" replied Wanda, \"I swear it\nby all that is holy to me. All that I have done was merely to fulfill\nyour dream and it was done for your sake.\n\n\"However, I shall take a lover, otherwise things will be only half\naccomplished, and in the end you will yet reproach me with not having\ntreated you cruelly enough, my dear beautiful slave! But to-day you\nshall be Severin again, the only one I love. I haven't given away\nyour clothes. They are here in the chest. Go and dress as you used\nto in the little Carpathian health-resort when our love was so intimate.\nForget everything that has happened since; oh, you will forget it\neasily in my arms; I shall kiss away all your sorrows.\"\n\nShe began to treat me tenderly like a child, to kiss me and caress\nme. Finally she said with a gracious smile, \"Go now and dress, I too\nwill dress. Shall I put on my fur-jacket? Oh yes, I know, now run\nalong!\"\n\nWhen I returned she was standing in the center of the room in her\nwhite satin dress, and the red _kazabaika_ edged with ermine; her hair\nwas white with powder and over her forehead she wore a small diamond\ndiadem. For a moment she reminded me in an uncanny way of Catherine\nthe Second, but she did not give me much time for reminiscences. She\ndrew me down on the ottoman beside her and we enjoyed two blissful\nhours. She was no longer the stern capricious mistress, she was\nentirely a fine lady, a tender sweetheart. She showed me photographs\nand books which had just appeared, and talked about them with so much\nintelligence, clarity, and good taste, that I more than once carried\nher hand to my lips, enraptured. She then had me recite several of\nLermontov's poems, and when I was all afire with enthusiasm, she\nplaced her small hand gently on mine. Her expression was soft, and her\neyes were filled with tender pleasure.\n\n\"Are you happy?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\nShe then leaned back on the cushions, and slowly opened her\n_kazabaika_.\n\nBut I quickly covered the half-bared breast again with the ermine.\n\"You are driving me mad.\" I stammered.\n\n\"Come!\"\n\nI was already lying in her arms, and like a serpent she was kissing\nme with her tongue, when again she whispered, \"Are you happy?\"\n\n\"Infinitely!\" I exclaimed.\n\nShe laughed aloud. It was an evil, shrill laugh which made cold\nshivers run down by back.\n\n\"You used to dream of being the slave, the plaything of a beautiful\nwoman, and now you imagine you are a free human being, a man, my\nlover-you fool! A sign from me, and you are a slave again. Down on\nyour knees!\"\n\nI sank down from the ottoman to her feet, but my eye still clung\ndoubtingly on hers.\n\n\"You can't believe it,\" she said, looking at me with her arms folded\nacross her breast. \"I am bored, and you will just do to while away\na couple of hours of time. Don't look at me that way--\"\n\nShe kicked me with her foot.\n\n\"You are just what I want, a human being, a thing, an animal--\"\n\nShe rang. The three negresses entered.\n\n\"Tie his hands behind his back.\"\n\nI remained kneeling and unresistingly let them do this. They led me\ninto the garden, down to the little vineyard, which forms the\nsouthern boundary. Corn had been planted between the espaliers, and\nhere and there a few dead stalks still stood. To one side was a\nplough.\n\nThe negresses tied me to a post, and amused themselves sticking me\nwith their golden hair-needles. But this did not last long, before\nWanda appeared with her ermine cap on her head, and with her hands\nin the pockets of her jacket. She had me untied, and then my hands\nwere fastened together on my back. She finally had a yoke put around\nmy neck, and harnessed me to the plough.\n\nThen her black demons drove me out into the field. One of them held\nthe plough, the other one led me by a line, the third applied the\nwhip, and Venus in Furs stood to one side and looked on.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I was serving dinner on the following day Wanda said: \"Bring\nanother cover, I want you to dine with me to-day,\" and when I was\nabout to sit down opposite her, she added, \"No, over here, close by\nmy side.\"\n\nShe is in the best of humors, gives me soup with her spoon, feeds me\nwith her fork, and places her head on the table like a playful kitten\nand flirts with me. I have the misfortune of looking at Haydee, who\nserves in my place, perhaps a little longer than is necessary. It is\nonly now that I noticed her noble, almost European cast of\ncountenance and her magnificent statuesque bust, which is as if hewn\nout of black marble. The black devil observes that she pleases me,\nand, grinning, shows her teeth. She has hardly left the room, before\nWanda leaps up in a rage.\n\n\"What, you dare to look at another woman besides me! Perhaps you\nlike her even better than you do me, she is even more demonic!\"\n\nI am frightened; I have never seen her like this before; she is\nsuddenly pale even to the lips and her whole body trembles. Venus in\nFurs is jealous of her slave. She snatches the whip from its hook and\nstrikes me in the face; then she calls her black servants, who bind\nme, and carry me down into the cellar, where they throw me into a\ndark, dank, subterranean compartment, a veritable prison-cell.\n\nThen the lock of the door clicks, the bolts are drawn, a key sings\nin the lock. I am a prisoner, buried.\n\nI have been lying here for I don't know how long, bound like a calf\nabout to be hauled to the slaughter, on a bundle of damp straw,\nwithout any light, without food, without drink, without sleep. It\nwould be like her to let me starve to death, if I don't freeze to\ndeath before then. I am shaking with cold. Or is it fever? I believe\nI am beginning to hate this woman.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA red streak, like blood, floods across the floor; it is a light\nfalling through the door which is now thrust open.\n\nWanda appears on the threshold, wrapped in her sables, holding a\nlighted torch.\n\n\"Are you still alive?\" she asks.\n\n\"Are you coming to kill me?\" I reply with a low, hoarse voice.\n\nWith two rapid strides Wanda reaches my side, she kneels down beside\nme, and places my head in her lap. \"Are you ill? Your eyes glow so,\ndo you love me? I want you to love me.\"\n\nShe draws forth a short dagger. I start with fright when its blade\ngleams in front of my eyes. I actually believe that she is about to\nkill me. She laughs, and cuts the ropes that bind me.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery evening after dinner she now has me called. I have to read to\nher, and she discusses with me all sorts of interesting problems and\nsubjects. She seems entirely transformed; it is as if she were\nashamed of the savagery which she betrayed to me and of the cruelty\nwith which she treated me. A touching gentleness transfigures her\nentire being, and when at the good-night she gives me her hand, a\nsuperhuman power of goodness and love lies in her eyes, of the kind\nwhich calls forth tears in us and causes us to forget all the\nmiseries of existence and all the terrors of death.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI am reading _Manon l'Escault_ to her. She feels the association, she\ndoesn't say a word, but she smiles from time to time, and finally she\nshuts up the little book.\n\n\"Don't you want to go on reading?\"\n\n\"Not to-day. We will ourselves act _Manon l'Escault_ to-day. I have a\nrendezvous in the Cascine, and you, my dear Chevalier, will accompany\nme; I know, you will do it, won't you?\"\n\n\"You command it.\"\n\n\"I do not command it, I beg it of you,\" she says with irresistible\ncharm. She then rises, puts her hands on my shoulders, and looks at\nme.\n\n\"Your eyes!\" she exclaims. \"I love you, Severin, you have no idea\nhow I love you!\"\n\n\"Yes, I have!\" I replied bitterly, \"so much so that you have\narranged for a rendezvous with some one else.\"\n\n\"I do this only to allure you the more,\" she replied vivaciously. \"I\nmust have admirers, so as not to lose you. I don't ever want to lose\nyou, never, do you hear, for I love only you, you alone.\"\n\nShe clung passionately to my lips.\n\n\"Oh, if I only could, as I would, give you all of my soul in a kiss--\nthus--but now come.\"\n\nShe slipped into a simple black velvet coat, and put a dark _bashlyk_\n[Footnote: A kind of Russian cap.] on her head. Then she rapidly went\nthrough the gallery, and entered the carriage.\n\n\"Gregor will drive,\" she called out to the coachman who withdrew in\nsurprise.\n\nI ascended the driver's seat, and angrily whipped up the horses.\n\nIn the Cascine where the main roadway turns into a leafy path, Wanda\ngot out. It was night, only occasional stars shone through the gray\nclouds that fled across the sky. By the bank of the Arno stood a man\nin a dark cloak, with a brigand's hat, and looked at the yellow\nwaves. Wanda rapidly walked through the shrubbery, and tapped him on\nthe shoulder. I saw him turn and seize her hand, and then they\ndisappeared behind the green wall.\n\nAn hour full of torments. Finally there was a rustling in the bushes\nto one side, and they returned.\n\nThe man accompanied her to the carriage. The light of the lamp fell\nfull and glaringly upon an infinitely young, soft and dreamy face\nwhich I had never before seen, and played in his long, blond curls.\n\nShe held out her hand which he kissed with deep respect, then she\nsignaled to me, and immediately the carriage flew along the leafy\nwall which follows the river like a long green screen.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bell at the garden-gate rings. It is a familiar face. The man\nfrom the Cascine.\n\n\"Whom shall I announce?\" I ask him in French. He timidly shakes his\nhead.\n\n\"Do you, perhaps, understand some German?\" he asks shyly.\n\n\"Yes. Your name, please.\"\n\n\"Oh! I haven't any yet,\" he replies, embarrassed--\"Tell your\nmistress the German painter from the Cascine is here and would like--\nbut there she is herself.\"\n\nWanda had stepped out on the balcony, and nodded toward the stranger.\n\n\"Gregor, show the gentleman in!\" she called to me.\n\nI showed the painter the stairs.\n\n\"Thanks, I'll find her now, thanks, thanks very much.\" He ran up the\nsteps. I remained standing below, and looked with deep pity on the\npoor German.\n\nVenus in Furs has caught his soul in the red snares of hair. He will\npaint her, and go mad.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is a sunny winter's day. Something that looks like gold trembles\non the leaves of the clusters of trees down below in the green level\nof the meadow. The camelias at the foot of the gallery are glorious\nin their abundant buds. Wanda is sitting in the loggia; she is\ndrawing. The German painter stands opposite her with his hands folded\nas in adoration, and looks at her. No, he rather looks at her face,\nand is entirely absorbed in it, enraptured.\n\nBut she does not see him, neither does she see me, who with the\nspade in my hand am turning over the flower-bed, solely that I may\nsee her and feel her nearness, which produces an effect on me like\npoetry, like music.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe painter has gone. It is a hazardous thing to do, but I risk it.\nI go up to the gallery, quite close, and ask Wanda \"Do you love the\npainter, mistress?\"\n\nShe looks at me without getting angry, shakes her head, and finally\neven smiles.\n\n\"I feel sorry for him,\" she replies, \"but I do not love him. I love no\none. _I used to love you, as ardently, as passionately, as deeply as\nit was possible for me to love,_ but now I don't love even you any\nmore; my heart is a void, dead, and this makes me sad.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I exclaimed, deeply moved.\n\n\"Soon, you too will no longer love me,\" she continued, \"tell me when\nyou have reached that point, and I will give back to you your\nfreedom.\"\n\n\"Then I shall remain your slave, all my life long, for I adore you\nand shall always adore you,\" I cried, seized by that fanaticism of\nlove which has repeatedly been so fatal to me.\n\nWanda looked at me with a curious pleasure. \"Consider well what you\ndo,\" she said. \"I have loved you infinitely and have been despotic\ntowards you so that I might fulfil your dream. Something of my old\nfeeling, a sort of real sympathy for you, still trembles in my\nbreast. When that too has gone who knows whether then I shall give\nyou your liberty; whether I shall not then become really cruel,\nmerciless, even brutal toward; whether I shall not take a diabolical\npleasure in tormenting and putting on the rack the man who worships\nme idolatrously, the while I remain indifferent or love someone else;\nperhaps, I shall enjoy seeing him die of his love for me. Consider\nthis well.\"\n\n\"I have long since considered all that,\" I replied as in a glow of\nfever. \"I cannot exist, cannot live without you; I shall die if you\nset me at liberty; let me remain your slave, kill me, but do not\ndrive me away.\"\n\n\"Very well then, be my slave,\" she replied, \"but don't forget that\nI no longer love you, and your love doesn't mean any more to me than\na dog's, and dogs are kicked.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day I visited the Venus of Medici.\n\nIt was still early, and the little octagonal room in the Tribuna was\nfilled with half-lights like a sanctuary; I stood with folded hands\nin deep adoration before the silent image of the divinity.\n\nBut I did not stand for long.\n\nNot a human soul was in the gallery, not even an Englishman, and I\nfell down on my knees. I looked up at the lovely slender body, the\nbudding breasts, the virginal and yet voluptuous face, the fragrant\ncurls which seemed to conceal tiny horns on each side of the forehead.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nMy mistress's bell.\n\nIt is noonday. She, however, is still abed with her arms intertwined\nbehind her neck.\n\n\"I want to bathe,\" she says, \"and you will attend me. Lock the door!\"\n\nI obey.\n\n\"Now go downstairs and make sure the door below is also locked.\"\n\nI descended the winding stairs that lead from her bedroom to the\nbath; my feet gave way beneath me, and I had to support myself\nagainst the iron banister. After having ascertained that the door\nleading to the Loggia and the garden was locked, I returned. Wanda\nwas now sitting on the bed with loosened hair, wrapped in her green\nvelvet furs. When she made a rapid movement, I noticed that the furs\nwere her only covering. It made me start terribly, I don't know why?\nI was like one condemned to death, who knows he is on the way to the\nscaffold, and yet begins to tremble when he sees it.\n\n\"Come, Gregor, take me on your arms.\"\n\n\"You mean, mistress?\"\n\n\"You are to carry me, don't you understand?\"\n\nI lifted her up, so that she rested in my arms, while she twined\nhers around my neck. Slowly, step by step, I went down the stairs\nwith her and her hair beat from time to time against my cheek and her\nfoot sought support against my knee. I trembled under the beautiful\nburden I was carrying, and every moment it seemed as if I had to\nbreak down beneath it.\n\nThe bath consisted of a wide, high rotunda, which received a soft\nquiet light from a red glass cupola above. Two palms extended their\nbroad leaves like a roof over a couch of velvet cushions. From here\nsteps covered with Turkish rugs led to the white marble basin which\noccupied the center.\n\n\"There is a green ribbon on my toilet-table upstairs,\" said Wanda,\nas I let her down on the couch, \"go get it, and also bring the whip.\"\n\nI flew upstairs and back again, and kneeling put both in my mistress's\nhands. She then had me twist her heavy electric hair into a large knot\nwhich I fastened with the green ribbon. Then I prepared the bath. I did\nthis very awkwardly because my hands and feet refused to obey me. Again\nand again I had to look at the beautiful woman lying on the red velvet\ncushions, and from time to time her wonderful body gleamed here and\nthere beneath the furs. Some magnetic power stronger than my will\ncompelled me to look. I felt that all sensuality and lustfulness lies in\nthat which is half-concealed or intentionally disclosed; and the truth\nof this I recognized even more acutely, when the basin at last was full,\nand Wanda threw off the fur-cloak with a single gesture, and stood\nbefore me like the goddess in the Tribuna.\n\nAt that moment she seemed as sacred and chaste to me in her unveiled\nbeauty, as did the divinity of long ago. I sank down on my knees\nbefore her, and devoutly pressed my lips on her foot.\n\nMy soul which had been storm-tossed only a little while earlier,\nsuddenly was perfectly calm, and I now felt no element of cruelty in\nWanda.\n\nShe slowly descended the stairs, and I could watch her with a\ncalmness in which not a single atom of torment or desire was\nintermingled. I could see her plunge into and rise out of the\ncrystalline water, and the wavelets which she herself raised played\nabout her like tender lovers.\n\nOur nihilistic aesthetician is right when he says: a real apple is\nmore beautiful than a painted one, and a living woman is more\nbeautiful than a Venus of stone.\n\nAnd when she left the bath, and the silvery drops and the roseate\nlight rippled down her body, I was seized with silent rapture. I\nwrapped the linen sheets about her, drying her glorious body. The\ncalm bliss remained with me, even now when one foot upon me as upon\na footstool, she rested on the cushions in her large velvet cloak.\nThe lithe sables nestled desirously against her cold marble-like body.\nHer left arm on which she supported herself lay like a sleeping swan\nin the dark fur of the sleeve, while her left hand played carelessly\nwith the whip.\n\nBy chance my look fell on the massive mirror on the wall opposite,\nand I cried out, for I saw the two of us in its golden frame as in\na picture. The picture was so marvellously beautiful, so strange, so\nimaginative, that I was filled with deep sorrow at the thought that\nits lines and colors would have to dissolve like mist.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Wanda.\n\nI pointed to the mirror.\n\n\"Ah, that is really beautiful,\" she exclaimed, \"too bad one can't\ncapture the moment and make it permanent.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" I asked. \"Would not any artist, even the most famous,\nbe proud if you gave him leave to paint you and make you immortal by\nmeans of his brush.\n\n\"The very thought that this extra-ordinary beauty is to be lost to\nthe world,\" I continued still watching her enthusiastically, \"is\nhorrible--all this glorious facial expression, this mysterious eye\nwith its green fires, this demonic hair, this magnificence of body.\nThe idea fills me with a horror of death, of annihilation. But the\nhand of an artist shall snatch you from this. You shall not like the\nrest of us disappear absolutely and forever, without leaving a trace\nof your having been. Your picture must live, even when you yourself\nhave long fallen to dust; your beauty must triumph beyond death!\"\n\nWanda smiled.\n\n\"Too bad, that present-day Italy hasn't a Titian or Raphael,\" she\nsaid, \"but, perhaps, love will make amends for genius, who knows; our\nlittle German might do?\" She pondered.\n\n\"Yes, he shall paint you, and I will see to it that the god of love\nmixes his colors.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe young painter has established his studio in her villa; he is\ncompletely in her net. He has just begun a Madonna, a Madonna with\nred hair and green eyes! Only the idealism of a German would attempt\nto use this thorough-bred woman as a model for a picture of\nvirginity. The poor fellow really is an almost bigger donkey than I\nam. Our misfortune is that our Titania has discovered our ass's ears\ntoo soon.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nNow she laughs derisively at us, and how she laughs! I hear her\ninsolent melodious laughter in his studio, under the open window of\nwhich I stand, jealously listening.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Are you mad, me--ah, it is unbelievable, me as the Mother of God!\"\nshe exclaimed and laughed again. \"Wait a moment, I will show you\nanother picture of myself, one that I myself have painted, and you\nshall copy it.\"\n\nHer head appeared in the window, luminous like a flame under the\nsunlight.\n\n\"Gregor!\"\n\nI hurried up the stairs, through the gallery, into the studio.\n\n\"Lead him to the bath,\" Wanda commanded, while she herself hurried\naway.\n\nA few moments passed and Wanda arrived; dressed in nothing but the\nsable fur, with the whip in her hand; she descended the stairs and\nstretched out on the velvet cushions as on the former occasion. I lay\nat her feet and she placed one of her feet upon me; her right hand\nplayed with the whip. \"Look at me,\" she said, \"with your deep,\nfanatical look, that's it.\"\n\nThe painter had turned terribly pale. He devoured the scene with his\nbeautiful dreamy blue eyes; his lips opened, but he remained dumb.\n\n\"Well, how do you like the picture?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is how I want to paint you,\" said the German, but it was\nreally not a spoken language; it was the eloquent moaning, the\nweeping of a sick soul, a soul sick unto death.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe charcoal outline of the painting is done; the heads and flesh\nparts are painted in. Her diabolical face is already becoming visible\nunder a few bold strokes, life flashes in her green eyes.\n\nWanda stands in front of the canvas with her arms crossed over her\nbreast.\n\n\"This picture, like many of those of the Venetian school, is\nsimultaneously to represent a portrait and to tell a story,\"\nexplained the painter, who again had become pale as death.\n\n\"And what will you call it?\" she asked, \"but what is the matter with\nyou, are you ill?\"\n\n\"I am afraid--\" he answered with a consuming look fixed on the\nbeautiful woman in furs, \"but let us talk of the picture.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us talk about the picture.\"\n\n\"I imagine the goddess of love as having descended from Mount Olympus\nfor the sake of some mortal man. And always cold in this modern world\nof ours, she seeks to keep her sublime body warm in a large heavy fur\nand her feet in the lap of her lover. I imagine the favorite of a\nbeautiful despot, who whips her slave, when she is tired of kissing\nhim, and the more she treads him underfoot, the more insanely he loves\nher. And so I shall call the picture: _Venus in Furs_.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe painter paints slowly, but his passion grows more and more\nrapidly. I am afraid he will end up by committing suicide. She plays\nwith him and propounds riddles to him which he cannot solve, and he\nfeels his blood congealing in the process, but it amuses her.\n\nDuring the sitting she nibbles at candies, and rolls the paper-wrappers\ninto little pellets with which she bombards him.\n\n\"I am glad you are in such good humor,\" said the painter, \"but your face\nhas lost the expression which I need for my picture.\"\n\n\"The expression which you need for your picture,\" she replied,\nsmiling. \"Wait a moment.\"\n\nShe rose, and dealt me a blow with the whip. The painter looked at\nher with stupefaction, and a child-like surprise showed on his face,\nmingled with disgust and admiration.\n\nWhile whipping me, Wanda's face acquired more and more of the cruel,\ncontemptuous character, which so haunts and intoxicates me.\n\n\"Is this the expression you need for your picture?\" she exclaimed.\nThe painter lowered his look in confusion before the cold ray of her\neye.\n\n\"It is the expression--\" he stammered, \"but I can't paint now--\"\n\n\"What?\" said Wanda, scornfully, \"perhaps I can help you?\"\n\n\"Yes--\" cried the German, as if taken with madness, \"whip me too.\"\n\n\"Oh! With pleasure,\" she replied, shrugging her shoulders, \"but if\nI am to whip you I want to do it in sober earnest.\"\n\n\"Whip me to death,\" cried the painter.\n\n\"Will you let me tie you?\" she asked, smiling.\n\n\"Yes--\" he moaned--\n\nWanda left the room for a moment, and returned with ropes.\n\n\"Well--are you still brave enough to put yourself into the power of\nVenus in Furs, the beautiful despot, for better or worse?\" she began\nironically.\n\n\"Yes, tie me,\" the painter replied dully. Wanda tied his hands on\nhis back and drew a rope through his arms and a second one around his\nbody, and fettered him to the cross-bars of the window. Then she\nrolled back the fur, seized the whip, and stepped in front of him.\n\nThe scene had a grim attraction for me, which I cannot describe. I\nfelt my heart beat, when, with a smile, she drew back her arm for the\nfirst blow, and the whip hissed through the air. He winced slightly\nunder the blow. Then she let blow after blow rain upon him, with her\nmouth half-opened and her teeth flashing between her red lips, until\nhe finally seemed to ask for mercy with his piteous, blue eyes. It\nwas indescribable.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe is sitting for him now, alone. He is working on her head.\n\nShe has posted me in the adjoining room behind a heavy curtain,\nwhere I can't be seen, but can see everything.\n\nWhat does she intend now?\n\nIs she afraid of him? She has driven him insane enough to be sure,\nor is she hatching a new torment for me? My knees tremble.\n\nThey are talking. He has lowered his voice so that I cannot\nunderstand a word, and she replies in the same way. What is the\nmeaning of this? Is there an understanding between them?\n\nI suffer frightful torments; my heart seems about to burst.\n\nHe kneels down before her, embraces her, and presses his head\nagainst her breast, and she--in her heartlessness--laughs--and now\nI hear her saying aloud:\n\n\"Ah! You need another application of the whip.\"\n\n\"Woman! Goddess! Are you without a heart--can't you love,\" exclaimed\nthe German, \"don't you even know, what it means to love, to be\nconsumed with desire and passion, can't you even imagine what I\nsuffer? Have you no pity for me?\"\n\n\"No!\" she replied proudly and mockingly, \"but I have the whip.\"\n\nShe drew it quickly from the pocket of her fur-coat, and struck him\nin the face with the handle. He rose, and drew back a couple of paces.\n\n\"Now, are you ready to paint again?\" she asked indifferently. He did\nnot reply, but again went to the easel and took up his brush and\npalette.\n\nThe painting is marvellously successful. It is a portrait which as\nfar as the likeness goes couldn't be better, and at the same time it\nseems to have an ideal quality. The colors glow, are supernatural;\nalmost diabolical, I would call them.\n\nThe painter has put all his sufferings, his adoration, and all his\nexecration into the picture.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nNow he is painting me; we are alone together for several hours every\nday. To-day he suddenly turned to me with his vibrant voice and said:\n\n\"You love this woman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I also love her.\" His eyes were bathed in tears. He remained silent\nfor a while, and continued painting.\n\n\"We have a mountain at home in Germany within which she dwells,\" he\nmurmured to himself. \"She is a demon.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe picture is finished. She insisted on paying him for it,\nmunificently, in the manner of queens.\n\n\"Oh, you have already paid me,\" he said, with a tormented smile,\nrefusing her offer.\n\nBefore he left, he secretly opened his portfolio, and let me look\ninside. I was startled. Her head looked at me as if out of a mirror\nand seemed actually to be alive.\n\n\"I shall take it along,\" he said, \"it is mine; she can't take it\naway from me. I have earned it with my heart's blood.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I am really rather sorry for the poor painter,\" she said to me to-day,\n\"it is absurd to be as virtuous as I am. Don't you think so too?\"\n\nI did not dare to reply to her.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot that I am talking with a slave; I need some fresh air,\nI want to be diverted, I want to forget.\n\n\"The carriage, quick!\"\n\nHer new dress is extravagant: Russian half-boots of violet-blue\nvelvet trimmed with ermine, and a skirt of the same material,\ndecorated with narrow stripes and rosettes of furs. Above it is an\nappropriate, close-fitting jacket, also richly trimmed and lined with\nermine. The headdress is a tall cap of ermine of the style of\nCatherine the Second, with a small aigrette, held in place by a\ndiamond-agraffe; her red hair falls loose down her back. She ascends\non the driver's seat, and holds the reins herself; I take my seat\nbehind. How she lashes on the horses! The carriage flies along like\nmad.\n\nApparently it is her intention to attract attention to-day, to make\nconquests, and she succeeds completely. She is the lioness of the\nCascine. People nod to her from carriages; on the footpath people\ngather in groups to discuss her. She pays no attention to anyone,\nexcept now and then acknowledging the greetings of elderly gentlemen\nwith a slight nod.\n\nSuddenly a young man on a lithe black horse dashes up at full speed.\nAs soon as he sees Wanda, he stops his horse and makes it walk. When\nhe is quite close, he stops entirely and lets her pass. And she too\nsees him--the lioness, the lion. Their eyes meet. She madly drives\npast him, but she cannot tear herself free from the magic power of\nhis look, and she turns her head after him.\n\nMy heart stops when I see the half-surprised, half-enraptured look\nwith which she devours him, but he is worthy of it.\n\nFor he is, indeed, a magnificent specimen of man, No, rather, he is\na man whose like I have never yet seen among the living. He is in the\nBelvedere, graven in marble, with the same slender, yet steely\nmusculature, with the same face and the same waving curls. What makes\nhim particularly beautiful is that he is beardless. If his hips were\nless narrow, one might take him for a woman in disguise. The curious\nexpression about the mouth, the lion's lip which slightly discloses\nthe teeth beneath, lends a flashing tinge of cruelty to the beautiful\nface--\n\nApollo flaying Marsyas.\n\nHe wears high black boots, closely fitting breeches of white\nleather, short fur coat of black cloth, of the kind worn by Italian\ncavalry officers, trimmed with astrakhan and many rich loops; on his\nblack locks is a red fez.\n\nI now understand the masculine Eros, and I marvel at Socrates for\nhaving remained virtuous in view of an Alcibiades like this.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have never seen my lioness so excited. Her cheeks flamed when she\nleft from the carriage at her villa. She hurried upstairs, and with\nan imperious gesture ordered me to follow.\n\nWalking up and down her room with long strides, she began to talk so\nrapidly, that I was frightened.\n\n\"You are to find out who the man in the Cascine was, immediately--\n\n\"Oh, what a man! Did you see him? What do you think of him? Tell me.\"\n\n\"The man is beautiful,\" I replied dully.\n\n\"He is so beautiful,\" she paused, supporting herself on the arm of\na chair, \"that he has taken my breath away.\"\n\n\"I can understand the impression he has made on you,\" I replied, my\nimagination carrying me away in a mad whirl. \"I am quite lost in\nadmiration myself, and I can imagine--\"\n\n\"You may imagine,\" she laughed aloud, \"that this man is my lover,\nand that he will apply the lash to you, and that you will enjoy being\npunished by him.\n\n\"But now go, go.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore evening fell, I had the desired information.\n\nWanda was still fully dressed when I returned. She reclined on the\nottoman, her face buried in her hands, her hair in a wild tangle,\nlike the red mane of a lioness.\n\n\"What is his name?\" she asked, uncanny calm.\n\n\"Alexis Papadopolis.\"\n\n\"A Greek, then,\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"He is very young?\"\n\n\"Scarcely older than you. They say he was educated in Paris, and\nthat he is an atheist. He fought against the Turks in Candia, and is\nsaid to have distinguished himself there no less by his race-hatred\nand cruelty, than by his bravery.\"\n\n\"All in all, then, a man,\" she cried with sparkling eyes.\n\n\"At present he is living in Florence,\" I continued, \"he is said to\nbe tremendously rich--\"\n\n\"I didn't ask you about that,\" she interrupted quickly and sharply.\n\"The man is dangerous. Aren't you afraid of him? I am afraid of him.\nHas he a wife?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A mistress?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What theaters does he attend?\"\n\n\"To-night he will be at the Nicolini Theater, where Virginia Marini\nand Salvini are acting; they are the greatest living artists in\nItaly, perhaps in Europe.\n\n\"See that you get a box--and be quick about it!\" she commanded.\n\n\"But, mistress--\"\n\n\"Do you want a taste of the whip?\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You can wait down in the lobby,\" she said when I had placed the\nopera-glasses and the programme on the edge of her box and adjusted\nthe footstool.\n\nI am standing there and had to lean against the wall for support so\nas not to fall down with envy and rage--no, rage isn't the right\nword; it was a mortal fear.\n\nI saw her in her box dressed in blue moire, with a huge ermine cloak\nabout her bare shoulders; he sat opposite. I saw them devour each\nother with their eyes. For both of them the stage, Goldoni's _Pamela,_\nSalvini, Marini, the public, even the entire world, were non-existant\nto-night. And I--what was I at that moment?--\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day she is attending the ball at the Greek ambassador's. Does she\nknow, that she will meet him there?\n\nAt any rate she dressed, as if she did. A heavy sea-green silk dress\nplastically encloses her divine form, leaving the bust and arms bare. In\nher hair, which is done into a single flaming knot, a white water-lily\nblossoms; from it the leaves of reeds interwoven with a few loose\nstrands fall down toward her neck. There no longer is any trace of\nagitation or trembling feverishness in her being. She is calm, so calm,\nthat I feel my blood congealing and my heart growing cold under her\nglance. Slowly, with a weary, indolent majesty, she ascends the marble\nstaircase, lets her precious wrap slide off, and listlessly enters the\nhall, where the smoke of a hundred candles has formed a silvery mist.\n\nFor a few moments my eyes follow her in a daze, then I pick up her\nfurs, which without my being aware, had slipped from my hands. They\nare still warm from her shoulders.\n\nI kiss the spot, and my eyes fill with tears.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nHe has arrived.\n\nIn his black velvet coat extravagantly trimmed with sable, he is a\nbeautiful, haughty despot who plays with the lives and souls of men.\nHe stands in the ante-room, looking around proudly, and his eyes rest\non me for an uncomfortably long time.\n\nUnder his icy glance I am again seized by a mortal fear. I have a\npresentiment that this man can enchain her, captivate her, subjugate\nher, and I feel inferior in contrast with his savage masculinity; I\nam filled with envy, with jealousy.\n\nI feel that I am a queer weakly creature of brains, merely! And what\nis most humiliating, I want to hate him, but I can't. Why is that\namong all the host of servants he has chosen me.\n\nWith an inimitably aristocratic nod of the head he calls me over to\nhim, and I--I obey his call--against my own will.\n\n\"Take my furs,\" he quickly commands.\n\nMy entire body trembles with resentment, but I obey, abjectly like\na slave.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAll night long I waited in the ante-room, raving as in a fever.\nStrange images hovered past my inner eye. I saw their meeting--their\nlong exchange of looks. I saw her float through the hall in his arms,\ndrunken, lying with half-closed lids against his breast. I saw him\nin the holy of holies of love, lying on the ottoman, not as slave,\nbut as master, and she at his feet. On my knees I served them, the\ntea-tray faltering in my hands, and I saw him reach for the whip.\nBut now the servants are talking about him.\n\nHe is a man who is like a woman; he knows that he is beautiful, and\nhe acts accordingly. He changes his clothes four or five times a day,\nlike a vain courtesan.\n\nIn Paris he appeared first in woman's dress, and the men assailed\nhim with love-letters. An Italian singer, famous equally for his art\nand his passionate intensity, even invaded his home, and lying on his\nknees before him threatened to commit suicide if he wouldn't be his.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he replied, smiling, \"I should like to do you the\nfavor, but you will have to carry out your threat, for I am a man.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe drawing-room has already thinned out to a marked degree, but she\napparently has no thought of leaving.\n\nMorning is already peering through the blinds.\n\nAt last I hear the rustling of her heavy gown which flows along\nbehind her like green waves. She advances step by step, engaged in\nconversation with him.\n\nI hardly exist for her any longer; she doesn't even trouble to give\nme an order.\n\n\"The cloak for madame,\" he commands. He, of course, doesn't think of\nlooking after her himself.\n\nWhile I put her furs about her, he stands to one side with his arms\ncrossed. While I am on my knees putting on her fur over-shoes, she\nlightly supports herself with her hand on his shoulder. She asks:\n\n\"And what about the lioness?\"\n\n\"When the lion whom she has chosen and with whom she lives is\nattacked by another,\" the Greek went on with his narrative, \"the\nlioness quietly lies down and watches the battle. Even if her mate\nis worsted she does not go to his aid. She looks on indifferently as\nhe bleeds to death under his opponent's claws, and follows the victor,\nthe stronger--that is the female's nature.\"\n\nAt this moment my lioness looked quickly and curiously at me.\n\nIt made me shudder, though I didn't know why--and the red dawn\nimmerses me and her and him in blood.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe did not go to bed, but merely threw off her ball-dress and undid\nher hair; then she ordered me to build a fire, and she sat by the\nfire-place, and stared into the flames.\n\n\"Do you need me any longer, mistress?\" I asked, my voice failed me\nat the last word.\n\nWanda shook her head.\n\nI left the room, passed through the gallery, and sat down on one of\nthe steps, leading from there down into the garden. A gentle north\nwind brought a fresh, damp coolness from the Arno, the green hills\nextended into the distance in a rosy mist, a golden haze hovered over\nthe city, over the round cupola of the Duomo.\n\nA few stars still tremble in the pale-blue sky.\n\nI tore open my coat, and pressed my burning forehead against the\nmarble. Everything that had happened so far seemed to me a mere\nchild's play; but now things were beginning to be serious, terribly\nserious.\n\nI anticipated a catastrophe, I visualized it, I could lay hold of it\nwith my hands, but I lacked the courage to meet it. My strength was\nbroken. And if I am honest with myself, neither the pains and\nsufferings that threatened me, not the humiliations that impended,\nwere the thing that frightened me.\n\nI merely felt a fear, the fear of losing her whom I loved with a\nsort of fanatical devotion; but it was so overwhelming, so crushing\nthat I suddenly began to sob like a child.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the day she remained locked in her room, and had the negress\nattend her. When the evening star rose glowing in the blue sky, I saw\nher pass through the garden, and, carefully following her at a\ndistance, watched her enter the shrine of Venus. I stealthily\nfollowed and peered through the chink in the door.\n\nShe stood before the divine image of the goddess, her hands folded\nas in prayer, and the sacred light of the star of love casts its blue\nrays over her.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn my couch at night the fear of losing her and despair took such\npowerful hold of me that they made a hero and a libertine of me. I\nlighted the little red oil-lamp which hung in the corridor beneath\na saint's image, and entered her bedroom, covering the light with one\nhand.\n\nThe lioness had been hunted and driven until she was exhausted. She\nhad fallen asleep among her pillows, lying on her back, her hands\nclenched, breathing heavily. A dream seemed to oppress her. I slowly\nwithdrew my hand, and let the red light fall full on her wonderful\nface.\n\nBut she did not awaken.\n\nI gently set the lamp on the floor, sank down beside Wanda's bed,\nand rested my head on her soft, glowing arm.\n\nShe moved slightly, but even now did not awaken. I do not know how\nlong I lay thus in the middle of the night, turned as into a stone\nby horrible torments.\n\nFinally a severe trembling seized me, and I was able to cry. My\ntears flowed over her arm. She quivered several times and finally sat\nup; she brushed her hand across her eyes, and looked at me.\n\n\"Severin,\" she exclaimed, more frightened than angry.\n\nI was unable to reply.\n\n\"Severin,\" she continued softly, \"what is the matter? Are you ill?\"\n\nHer voice sounded so sympathetic, so kind, so full of love, that it\nclutched my breast like red-hot tongs and I began to sob aloud.\n\n\"Severin,\" she began anew. \"My poor unhappy friend.\" Her hand gently\nstroked my hair. \"I am sorry, very sorry for you; but I can't help\nyou; with the best intention in the world I know of nothing that\nwould cure you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Wanda, must it be?\" I moaned in my agony.\n\n\"What, Severin? What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any more?\" I continued. \"Haven't you even a\nlittle bit of pity for me? Has the beautiful stranger taken complete\npossession of you?\"\n\n\"I cannot lie,\" she replied softly after a short pause. \"He has made\nan impression on me which I haven't yet been able to analyse, further\nthan that I suffer and tremble beneath it. It is an impression of the\nsort I have met with in the works of poets or on the stage, but I\nalways thought it was a figment of the imagination. Oh, he is a man\nlike a lion, strong and beautiful and yet gentle, not brutal like the\nmen of our northern world. I am sorry for you, Severin, I am; but I\nmust possess him. What am I saying? I must give myself to him, if he\nwill have me.\"\n\n\"Consider your reputation, Wanda, which so far has remained\nspotless,\" I exclaimed, \"even if I no longer mean anything to you.\"\n\n\"I am considering it,\" she replied, \"I intend to be strong, as long\nas it is possible, I want--\" she buried her head shyly in the pillows\n--\"I want to become his wife--if he will have me.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I cried, seized again by that mortal fear, which always\nrobs me of my breath, makes me lose possession of myself, \"you want\nto be his wife, belong to him for always. Oh! Do not drive me away!\nHe does not love you--\"\n\n\"Who says that?\" she exclaimed, flaring up.\n\n\"He does not love you,\" I went on passionately, \"but I love you, I\nadore you, I am your slave, I let you tread me underfoot, I want to\ncarry you on my arms through life.\"\n\n\"Who says that he doesn't love me?\" she interrupted vehemently.\n\n\"Oh! be mine,\" I replied, \"be mine! I cannot exist, cannot live\nwithout you. Have mercy on me, Wanda, have mercy!\"\n\nShe looked at me again, and her face had her cold heartless\nexpression, her evil smile.\n\n\"You say he doesn't love me,\" she said, scornfully. \"Very well then,\nget what consolation you can out of it.\"\n\nWith this she turned over on the other side, and contemptuously\nshowed me her back.\n\n\"Good God, are you a woman without flesh or blood, haven't you a\nheart as well as I!\" I cried, while my breast heaved convulsively.\n\n\"You know what I am,\" she replied, coldly. \"I am a woman of stone,\n_Venus in Furs_, your ideal, kneel down, and pray to me.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I implored, \"mercy!\"\n\nShe began to laugh. I buried my face in her pillows. Pain had\nloosened the floodgates of my tears and I let them flow.\n\nFor a long time silence reigned, then Wanda slowly raised herself.\n\n\"You bore me,\" she began.\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"I am tired, let me go to sleep.\"\n\n\"Mercy,\" I implored. \"Do not drive me away. No man, no one, will\nlove you as I do.\"\n\n\"Let me go to sleep,\"--she turned her back to me again.\n\nI leaped up, and snatched the poinard, which hung beside her bed,\nfrom its sheath, and placed its point against my breast.\n\n\"I shall kill myself here before your eyes,\" I murmured dully.\n\n\"Do what you please,\" Wanda replied with complete indifference. \"But\nlet me go to sleep.\" She yawned aloud. \"I am very sleepy.\"\n\nFor a moment I stood as if petrified. Then I began to laugh and cry\nat the same time. Finally I placed the poinard in my belt, and again\nfell on my knees before her.\n\n\"Wanda, listen to me, only for a few moments,\" I begged.\n\n\"I want to go to sleep! Don't you hear!\" she cried, leaping angrily\nout of bed and pushing me away with her foot. \"You forget that I am\nyour mistress?\" When I didn't budge, she seized the whip and struck\nme. I rose; she struck me again--this time right in the face.\n\n\"Wretch, slave!\"\n\nWith clenched fist held heavenward, I left her bedroom with a sudden\nresolve. She tossed the whip aside, and broke out into clear\nlaughter. I can imagine that my theatrical attitude must have been\nvery droll.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have determined to set myself free from this heartless woman, who\nhas treated me so cruelly, and is now about to break faith and betray\nme, as a reward for all my slavish devotion, for everything I have\nsuffered from her. I packed my few belongings into a bundle, and then\nwrote her as follows:\n\n\"Dear Madam,--\n\nI have loved you even to madness, I have given myself to you as no man\never has given himself to a woman. You have abused my most sacred\nemotions, and played an impudent, frivolous game with me. However, as\nlong as you were merely cruel and merciless, it was still possible for\nme to love you. Now you are about to become _cheap_. I am no longer\nthe slave whom you can kick about and whip. You yourself have set me\nfree, and I am leaving a woman I can only hate and despise.\n\nSeverin Kusiemski.\"\n\nI handed these lines to the negress, and hastened away as fast as I\ncould go. I arrived at the railway-station all out of breath.\nSuddenly I felt a sharp pain in my heart and stopped. I began to\nweep. It is humiliating that I want to flee and I can't. I turn back--\nwhither?--to her, whom I abhor, and yet, at the same time, adore.\n\nAgain I pause. I cannot go back. I dare not.\n\nBut how am I to leave Florence. I remember that I haven't any money,\nnot a penny. Very well then, on foot; it is better to be an honest\nbeggar than to eat the bread of a courtesan.\n\nBut still I can't leave.\n\nShe has my pledge, my word of honor. I have to return. Perhaps she\nwill release me.\n\nAfter a few rapid strides, I stop again.\n\nShe has my word of honor and my bond, that I shall remain her slave\nas long as she desires, until she herself gives me my freedom. But\nI might kill myself.\n\nI go through the Cascine down to the Arno, where its yellow waters\nplash monotonously about a couple of stray willows. There I sit, and\ncast up my final accounts with existence. I let my entire life pass\nbefore me in review. On the whole, it is rather a wretched affair--a\nfew joys, an endless number of indifferent and worthless things, and\nbetween these an abundant harvest of pains, miseries, fears,\ndisappointments, shipwrecked hopes, afflictions, sorrow and grief.\n\nI thought of my mother, whom I loved so deeply and whom I had to\nwatch waste away beneath a horrible disease; of my brother, who full\nof the promise of joy and happiness died in the flower of youth,\nwithout even having put his lips to the cup of life. I thought of my\ndead nurse, my childhood playmates, the friends that had striven and\nstudied with me; of all those, covered by the cold, dead, indifferent\nearth. I thought of my turtle-dove, who not infrequently made his\ncooing bows to me, instead of to his mate.--All have returned, dust\nunto dust.\n\nI laughed aloud, and slid down into the water, but at the same\nmoment I caught hold of one of the willow-branches, hanging above the\nyellow waves. As in a vision, I see the woman who has caused all my\nmisery. She hovers above the level of the water, luminous in the\nsunlight as though she were transparent, with red flames about her\nhead and neck. She turns her face toward me and smiles.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI am back again, dripping, wet through, glowing with shame and\nfever. The negress has delivered my letter; I am judged, lost, in the\npower of a heartless, affronted woman.\n\nWell, let her kill me. I am unable to do it myself, and yet I have\nno wish to go on living.\n\nAs I walk around the house, she is standing in the gallery, leaning\nover the railing. Her face is full in the light of the sun, and her\ngreen eyes sparkle.\n\n\"Still alive?\" she asked, without moving. I stood silent, with bowed\nhead.\n\n\"Give me back my poinard,\" she continued. \"It is of no use to you.\nYou haven't even the courage to take your own life.\"\n\n\"I have lost it,\" I replied, trembling, shaken by chills.\n\nShe looked me over with a proud, scornful glance.\n\n\"I suppose you lost it in the Arno?\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"No\nmatter. Well, and why didn't you leave?\"\n\nI mumbled something which neither she nor I myself could understand.\n\n\"Oh! you haven't any money,\" she cried. \"Here!\" With an\nindescribably disdainful gesture she tossed me her purse.\n\nI did not pick it up.\n\nBoth of us were silent for some time.\n\n\"You don't want to leave then?\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWanda drives in the Cascine without me, and goes to the theater\nwithout me; she receives company, and the negress serves her. No one\nasks after me. I stray about the garden, irresolutely, like an animal\nthat has lost its master.\n\nLying among the bushes, I watch a couple of sparrows, fighting over\na seed.\n\nSuddenly I hear the swish of a woman's dress.\n\nWanda approaches in a gown of dark silk, modestly closed up to the\nneck; the Greek is with her. They are in an eager discussion, but I\ncannot as yet understand a word of what they are saying. He stamps\nhis foot so that the gravel scatters about in all directions, and he\nlashes the air with his riding whip. Wanda startles.\n\nIs she afraid that he will strike her?\n\nHave they gone that far?\n\nHe has left her, she calls him; he does not hear her, does not want\nto hear her.\n\nWanda sadly lowers her head, and then sits down on the nearest\nstone-bench. She sits for a long time, lost in thought. I watch her with\na sort of malevolent pleasure, finally I pull myself together by sheer\nforce of will, and ironically step before her. She startles, and\ntrembles all over.\n\n\"I come to wish you happiness,\" I said, bowing, \"I see, my dear\nlady, too, has found a master.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank God!\" she exclaimed, \"not a new slave, I have had enough\nof them. A master! Woman needs a master, and she adores him.\"\n\n\"You adore him, Wanda?\" I cried, \"this brutal person--\"\n\n\"Yes, I love him, as I have never loved any one else.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I clenched my fists, but tears already filled my eyes, and\nI was seized by the delirium of passion, as by a sweet madness. \"Very\nwell, take him as your husband, let him be your master, but I want\nto remain your slave, as long as I live.\"\n\n\"You want to remain my slave, even then?\" she said, \"that would be\ninteresting, but I am afraid he wouldn't permit it.\"\n\n\"He?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is already jealous of you,\" she exclaimed, \"he, of you! He\ndemanded that I dismiss you immediately, and when I told him who you\nwere--\"\n\n\"You told him--\" I repeated, thunderstruck.\n\n\"I told him everything,\" she replied, \"our whole story, all your\nqueerness, everything--and he, instead of being amused, grew angry,\nand stamped his foot.\"\n\n\"And threatened to strike you?\"\n\nWanda looked to the ground, and remained silent.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" I said with mocking bitterness, \"you are afraid of\nhim, Wanda!\" I threw myself down at her feet, and in my agitation\nembraced her knees. \"I don't want anything of you, except to be your\nslave, to be always near you! I will be your dog-\"\n\n\"Do you know, you bore me?\" said Wanda, indifferently.\n\nI leaped up. Everything within me was seething.\n\n\"You are now no longer cruel, but cheap,\" I said, clearly and\ndistinctly, accentuating every word.\n\n\"You have already written that in your letter,\" Wanda replied, with\na proud shrug of the shoulders. \"A man of brains should never repeat\nhimself.\"\n\n\"The way you are treating me,\" I broke out, \"what would you call it?\"\n\n\"I might punish you,\" she replied ironically, \"but I prefer this\ntime to reply with reasons instead of lashes. You have no right to\naccuse me. Haven't I always been honest with you? Haven't I warned\nyou more than once? Didn't I love you with all my heart, even\npassionately, and did I conceal the fact from you, that it was\ndangerous to give yourself into my power, to abase yourself before\nme, and that I want to be dominated? But you wished to be my\nplaything, my slave! You found the highest pleasure in feeling the\nfoot, the whip of an arrogant, cruel woman. What do you want now?\n\n\"Dangerous potentialities were slumbering in me, but you were the\nfirst to awaken them. If I now take pleasure in torturing you,\nabusing you, it is your fault; you have made of me what I now am, and\nnow you are even unmanly, weak, and miserable enough to accuse me.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am guilty,\" I said, \"but haven't I suffered because of it?\nLet us put an end now to the cruel game.\"\n\n\"That is my wish, too,\" she replied with a curious deceitful look.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I exclaimed violently, \"don't drive me to extremes; you see\nthat I am a man again.\"\n\n\"A fire of straw,\" she replied, \"which makes a lot of stir for a\nmoment, and goes out as quickly as it flared up. You imagine you can\nintimidate me, and you only make yourself ridiculous. Had you been\nthe man I first thought you were, serious, reserved, stern, I would\nhave loved you faithfully, and become your wife. Woman demands that\nshe can look up to a man, but one like you who voluntarily places his\nneck under her foot, she uses as a welcome plaything, only to toss\nit aside when she is tired of it.\"\n\n\"Try to toss me aside,\" I said, jeeringly. \"Some toys are dangerous.\"\n\n\"Don't challenge me,\" exclaimed Wanda. Her eyes began to flash, and\na flush entered her cheeks.\n\n\"If you won't be mine now,\" I continued, with a voice stifled with\nrage, \"no one else shall possess you either.\"\n\n\"What play is this from?\" she mocked, seizing me by the breast. She\nwas pale with anger at this moment. \"Don't challenge me,\" she\ncontinued, \"I am not cruel, but I don't know whether I may not become\nso and whether then there will be any bounds.\"\n\n\"What worse can you do, than to make your lover, your husband?\" I\nexclaimed, more and more enraged.\n\n\"I might make you _his_ slave,\" she replied quickly, \"are you not in\nmy power? Haven't I the agreement? But, of course, you will merely\ntake pleasure in it, if I have you bound, and say to him.\n\n\"Do with him what you please.\"\n\n\"Woman, are you mad!\" I cried.\n\n\"I am entirely rational,\" she said, calmly. \"I warn you for the last\ntime. Don't offer any resistance, one who has gone as far as I have\ngone might easily go still further. I feel a sort of hatred for you,\nand would find a real joy in seeing him beat you to death; I am still\nrestraining myself, but--\"\n\nScarcely master of myself any longer, I seized her by the wrist and\nforced her to the ground, so that she lay on her knees before me.\n\n\"Severin!\" she cried. Rage and terror were painted on her face.\n\n\"I shall kill you if you marry him,\" I threatened; the words came\nhoarsely and dully from my breast. \"You are mine, I won't let you go,\nI love you too much.\" Then I clutched her and pressed her close to\nme; my right hand involuntarily seized the dagger which I still had\nin my belt.\n\nWanda fixed a large, calm, incomprehensible look on me.\n\n\"I like you that way,\" she said, carelessly. \"Now you are a man, and\nat this moment I know I still love you.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I wept with rapture, and bent down over her, covering her\ndear face with kisses, and she, suddenly breaking into a loud gay\nlaugh, said, \"Have you finished with your ideal now, are you\nsatisfied with me?\"\n\n\"You mean?\" I stammered, \"that you weren't serious?\"\n\n\"I am very serious,\" she gaily continued. \"I love you, only you, and\nyou--you foolish, little man, didn't know that everything was only\nmake-believe and play-acting. How hard it often was for me to strike\nyou with the whip, when I would have rather taken your head and\ncovered it with kisses. But now we are through with that, aren't we?\nI have played my cruel role better than you expected, and now you\nwill be satisfied with my being a good, little wife who isn't\naltogether unattractive. Isn't that so? We will live like rational\npeople--\"\n\n\"You will marry me!\" I cried, overflowing with happiness.\n\n\"Yes--marry you--you dear, darling man,\" whispered Wanda, kissing my\nhands.\n\nI drew her up to my breast.\n\n\"Now, you are no longer Gregor, my slave,\" said she, \"but Severin,\nthe dear man I love--\"\n\n\"And he--you don't love him?\" I asked in agitation.\n\n\"How could you imagine my loving a man of his brutal type? You were\nblind to everything, I was really afraid for you.\"\n\n\"I almost killed myself for your sake.\"\n\n\"Really?\" she cried, \"ah, I still tremble at the thought, that you\nwere already in the Arno.\"\n\n\"But you saved me,\" I replied, tenderly. \"You hovered over the\nwaters and smiled, and your smile called me back to life.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have a curious feeling when I now hold her in my arms and she lies\nsilently against my breast and lets me kiss her and smiles. I feel\nlike one who has suddenly awakened out of a feverish delirium, or\nlike a shipwrecked man who has for many days battled with waves that\nmomentarily threatened to devour him and finally has found a safe\nshore.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hate this Florence, where you have been so unhappy,\" she\ndeclared, as I was saying good-night to her. \"I want to leave\nimmediately, tomorrow, you will be good enough to write a couple of\nletters for me, and, while you are doing that, I will drive to the\ncity to pay my farewell visits. Is that satisfactory to you?\"\n\n\"Of course, you dear, sweet, beautiful woman.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nEarly in the morning she knocked at my door to ask how I had slept.\nHer tenderness is positively wonderful. I should never have believed\nthat she could be so tender.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe has now been gone for over four hours. I have long since\nfinished the letters, and am now sitting in the gallery, looking down\nthe street to see whether I cannot discover her carriage in the\ndistance. I am a little worried about her, and yet I know there is\nno reason under heaven why I should doubt or fear. However, a feeling\nof oppression weighs me down, and I cannot rid myself of it. It is\nprobably the sufferings of the past days, which still cast their\nshadows into my soul.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe is back, radiant with happiness and contentment.\n\n\"Well, has everything gone as you wished?\" I asked tenderly, kissing\nher hand.\n\n\"Yes, dear heart,\" she replied, \"and we shall leave to-night. Help\nme pack my trunks.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nToward evening she asked me to go to the post-office and mail her\nletters myself. I took her carriage, and was back within an hour.\n\n\"Mistress has asked for you,\" said the negress, with a grin, as I\nascended the wide marble stairs.\n\n\"Has anyone been here?\"\n\n\"No one,\" she replied, crouching down on the steps like a black cat.\n\nI slowly passed through the drawing-room, and then stood before her\nbedroom door.\n\nWhy does my heart beat so? Am I not perfectly happy?\n\nOpening the door softly, I draw back the portiere. Wanda is lying on\nthe ottoman, and does not seem to notice me. How beautiful she looks,\nin her silver-gray dress, which fits closely, and while displaying\nin tell-tale fashion her splendid figure, leaves her wonderful bust\nand arms bare.\n\nHer hair is interwoven with, and held up by a black velvet ribbon.\nA mighty fire is burning in the fire-place, the hanging lamp casts\na reddish glow, and the whole room is as if drowned in blood.\n\n\"Wanda,\" I said at last.\n\n\"Oh Severin,\" she cried out joyously. \"I have been impatiently\nwaiting for you.\" She leaped up, and folded me in her arms. She sat\ndown again on the rich cushions and tried to draw me down to her\nside, but I softly slid down to her feet and placed my head in her\nlap.\n\n\"Do you know I am very much in love with you to-day?\" she whispered,\nbrushing a few stray hairs from my forehead and kissing my eyes.\n\n\"How beautiful your eyes are, I have always loved them as the best\nof you, but to-day they fairly intoxicate me. I am all--\" She\nextended her magnificent limbs and tenderly looked at me from beneath\nher red lashes.\n\n\"And you--you are cold--you hold me like a block of wood; wait, I'll\nstir you with the fire of love,\" she said, and again clung fawningly\nand caressingly to my lips.\n\n\"I no longer please you; I suppose I'll have to be cruel to you\nagain, evidently I have been too kind to you to-day. Do you know, you\nlittle fool, what I shall do, I shall whip you for a while--\"\n\n\"But child--\"\n\n\"I want to.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Come, let me bind you,\" she continued, and ran gaily through the\nroom. \"I want to see you very much in love, do you understand? Here\nare the ropes. I wonder if I can still do it?\"\n\nShe began with fettering my feet and then she tied my hands behind\nmy back, pinioning my arms like those of a prisoner.\n\n\"So,\" she said, with gay eagerness. \"Can you still move?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Fine--\"\n\nShe then tied a noose in a stout rope, threw it over my head, and\nlet it slip down as far as the hips. She drew it tight, and bound me\nto a pillar.\n\nA curious tremor seized me at that moment.\n\n\"I have a feeling as if I were about to be executed,\" I said with a\nlow voice.\n\n\"Well, you shall have a thorough punishment to-day,\" exclaimed Wanda.\n\n\"But put on your fur-jacket, please,\" I said.\n\n\"I shall gladly give you that pleasure,\" she replied. She got her\n_kazabaika_, and put it on. Then she stood in front of me with\nher arms folded across her chest, and looked at me out of half-closed\neyes.\n\n\"Do you remember the story of the ox of Dionysius?\" she asked.\n\n\"I remember it only vaguely, what about it?\"\n\n\"A courtier invented a new implement of torture for the Tyrant of\nSyracuse. It was an iron ox in which those condemned to death were\nto be shut, and then pushed into a mighty furnace.\n\n\"As soon as the iron ox began to get hot, and the condemned person\nbegan to cry out in his torment, his wails sounded like the bellowing\nof an ox.\n\n\"Dionysius nodded graciously to the inventor, and to put his\ninvention to an immediate test had him shut up in the iron ox.\n\n\"It is a very instructive story.\n\n\"It was you who innoculated me with selfishness, pride, and cruelty,\nand _you shall be their first victim._ I now literally enjoy having a\nhuman being that thinks and feels and desires like myself in my power;\nI love to abuse a man who is stronger in intelligence and body than I,\nespecially a man who loves me.\n\n\"Do you still love me?\"\n\n\"Even to madness,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"So much the better,\" she replied, \"and so much the more will you\nenjoy what I am about to do with you now.\"\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" I asked. \"I don't understand you,\nthere is a gleam of real cruelty in your eyes to-day, and you are\nstrangely beautiful--completely _Venus in Furs.\"_\n\nWithout replying Wanda placed her arms around my neck and kissed me.\nI was again seized by my fanatical passion.\n\n\"Where is the whip?\" I asked.\n\nWanda laughed, and withdrew a couple of steps.\n\n\"You really insist upon being punished?\" she exclaimed, proudly\ntossing back her head.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nSuddenly Wanda's face was completely transformed. It was as if\ndisfigured by rage; for a moment she seemed even ugly to me.\n\n\"Very well, then _you_ whip him!\" she called loudly.\n\nAt the same instant the beautiful Greek stuck his head of black\ncurls through the curtains of her four-poster bed. At first I was\nspeechless, petrified. There was a horribly comic element in the\nsituation. I would have laughed aloud, had not my position been at\nthe same time so terribly cruel and humiliating.\n\nIt went beyond anything I had imagined. A cold shudder ran down my\nback, when my rival stepped from the bed in his riding boots, his\ntight-fitting white breeches, and his short velvet jacket, and I saw\nhis athletic limbs.\n\n\"You are indeed cruel,\" he said, turning to Wanda.\n\n\"Only inordinately fond of pleasure,\" she replied with a wild sort\nof humor. \"Pleasure alone lends value to existence; whoever enjoys\ndoes not easily part from life, whoever suffers or is needy meets\ndeath like a friend.\n\n\"But whoever wants to enjoy must take life gaily in the sense of the\nancient world; he dare not hesitate to enjoy at the expense of others;\nhe must never feel pity; he must be ready to harness others to his\ncarriage or his plough as though they were animals. He must know how to\nmake slaves of men who feel and would enjoy as he does, and use them for\nhis service and pleasure without remorse. It is not his affair whether\nthey like it, or whether they go to rack and ruin. He must always\nremember this, that if they had him in their power, as he has them they\nwould act in exactly the same way, and he would have to pay for their\npleasure with his sweat and blood and soul. That was the world of the\nancients: pleasure and cruelty, liberty and slavery went hand in hand.\nPeople who want to live like the gods of Olympus must of necessity have\nslaves whom they can toss into their fish-ponds, and gladiators who will\ndo battle, the while they banquet, and they must not mind if by chance a\nbit of blood bespatters them.\"\n\nHer words brought back my complete self-possession.\n\n\"Unloosen me!\" I exclaimed angrily.\n\n\"Aren't you my slave, my property?\" replied Wanda. \"Do you want me\nto show you the agreement?\"\n\n\"Untie me!\" I threatened, \"otherwise--\" I tugged at the ropes.\n\n\"Can he tear himself free?\" she asked. \"He has threatened to kill me.\"\n\n\"Be entirely at ease,\" said the Greek, testing my fetters.\n\n\"I shall call for help,\" I began again.\n\n\"No one will hear you,\" replied Wanda, \"and no one will hinder me\nfrom abusing your most sacred emotions or playing a frivolous game\nwith you.\" she continued, repeating with satanic mockery phrases from\nmy letter to her.\n\n\"Do you think I am at this moment merely cruel and merciless, or am\nI also about to become cheap? What? Do you still love me, or do you\nalready hate and despise me? Here is the whip--\" She handed it to the\nGreek who quickly stepped closer.\n\n\"Don't you dare!\" I exclaimed, trembling with indignation, \"I won't\npermit it--\"\n\n\"Oh, because I don't wear furs,\" the Greek replied with an ironical\nsmile, and he took his short sable from the bed.\n\n\"You are adorable,\" exclaimed Wanda, kissing him, and helping him\ninto his furs.\n\n\"May I really whip him?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do with him what you please,\" replied Wanda.\n\n\"Beast!\" I exclaimed, utterly revolted.\n\nThe Greek fixed his cold tigerish look upon me and tried out the\nwhip. His muscles swelled when he drew back his arms, and made the\nwhip hiss through the air. I was bound like Marsyas while Apollo was\ngetting ready to flay me.\n\nMy look wandered about the room and remained fixed on the ceiling,\nwhere Samson, lying at Delilah's feet, was about to have his eyes put\nout by the Philistines. The picture at that moment seemed to me like\na symbol, an eternal parable of passion and lust, of the love of man\nfor woman. \"Each one of us in the end is a Samson,\" I thought, \"and\nultimately for better or worse is betrayed by the woman he loves,\nwhether he wears an ordinary coat or sables.\"\n\n\"Now watch me break him in,\" said the Greek. He showed his teeth,\nand his face acquired the blood-thirsty expression, which startled\nme the first time I saw him.\n\nAnd he began to apply the lash--so mercilessly, with such frightful\nforce that I quivered under each blow, and began to tremble all over\nwith pain. Tears rolled down over my cheeks. In the meantime Wanda\nlay on the ottoman in her fur-jacket, supporting herself on her arm;\nshe looked on with cruel curiosity, and was convulsed with laughter.\n\nThe sensation of being whipped by a successful rival before the eyes\nof an adored woman cannot be described. I almost went mad with shame\nand despair.\n\nWhat was most humiliating was that at first I felt a certain wild,\nsupersensual stimulation under Apollo's whip and the cruel laughter\nof my Venus, no matter how horrible my position was. But Apollo\nwhipped on and on, blow after blow, until I forgot all about poetry,\nand finally gritted my teeth in impotent rage, and cursed my wild\ndreams, woman, and love.\n\nAll of a sudden I saw with horrible clarity whither blind passion\nand lust have led man, ever since Holofernes and Agamemnon--into a\nblind alley, into the net of woman's treachery, into misery, slavery,\nand death.\n\nIt was as though I were awakening from a dream.\n\nBlood was already flowing under the whip. I wound like a worm that\nis trodden on, but he whipped on without mercy, and she continued to\nlaugh without mercy. In the meantime she locked her packed trunk and\nslipped into her travelling furs, and was still laughing, when she\nwent downstairs on his arm and entered the carriage.\n\nThen everything was silent for a moment.\n\nI listened breathlessly.\n\nThe carriage door slammed, the horse began to pull--the rolling of\nthe carriage for a short time--then all was over.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment I thought of taking vengeance, of killing him, but I\nwas bound by the abominable agreement. So nothing was left for me to\ndo except to keep my pledged word and grit my teeth.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nMy first impulse after this, the most cruel catastrophe of my life,\nwas to seek laborious tasks, dangers, and privations. I wanted to\nbecome a soldier and go to Asia or Algiers, but my father was old and\nill and wanted me.\n\nSo I quietly returned home and for two years helped him bear his\nburdens, and learned how to look after the estate which I had never\ndone before. To _labor_ and to _do my duty_ was comforting like a\ndrink of fresh water. Then my father died, and I inherited the estate,\nbut it meant no change.\n\nI had put on my own Spanish boots and went on living just as\nrationally as if the old man were standing behind me, looking over\nmy shoulder with his large wise eyes.\n\nOne day a box arrived, accompanied by a letter. I recognized Wanda's\nwriting.\n\nCuriously moved, I opened it, and read.\n\n\"Sir.--\n\nNow that over three years have passed since that night in Florence,\nI suppose, I may confess to you that I loved you deeply. You\nyourself, however, stifled my love by your fantastic devotion and\nyour insane passion. From the moment that you became my slave, I knew\nit would be impossible for you ever to become my husband. However,\nI found it interesting to have you realize your ideal in my own person,\nand, while I gloriously amused myself, perhaps, to cure you.\n\nI found the strong man for whom I felt a need, and I was as happy\nwith him as, I suppose, it is possible for any one to be on this\nfunny ball of clay.\n\nBut my happiness, like all things mortal, was of short duration.\nAbout a year ago he fell in a duel, and since then I have been living\nin Paris, like an Aspasia--\n\nAnd you?--Your life surely is not without its sunshine, if you have\ngained control of your imagination, and those qualities in you have\nmaterialized, which at first so attracted me to you--your clarity of\nintellect, kindness of heart, and, above all else, your--_moral\nseriousness_.\n\nI hope you have been cured under my whip; the cure was cruel, but\nradical. In memory of that time and of a woman who loved you\npassionately, I am sending you the portrait by the poor German.\n\n_Venus in Furs_.\"\n\nI had to smile, and as I fell to musing the beautiful woman suddenly\nstood before me in her velvet jacket trimmed with ermine, with the\nwhip in her hand. And I continued to smile at the woman I had once\nloved so insanely, at the fur-jacket that had once so entranced me,\nat the whip, and ended by smiling at myself and saying: The cure was\ncruel, but radical; but the main point is, I have been cured.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And the moral of the story?\" I said to Severin when I put the\nmanuscript down on the table.\n\n\"That I was a donkey,\" he exclaimed without turning around, for he\nseemed to be embarrassed. \"If only I had beaten her!\"\n\n\"A curious remedy,\" I exclaimed, \"which might answer with your\npeasant-women--\"\n\n\"Oh, they are used to it,\" he replied eagerly, \"but imagine the\neffect upon one of our delicate, nervous, hysterical ladies--\"\n\n\"But the moral?\"\n\n\"That woman, as nature has created her and as man is at present\neducating her, is his enemy. She can only be his slave or his despot,\nbut _never his companion._ This she can become only when she has\nthe same rights as he, and is his equal in education and work.\n\n\"At present we have only the choice of being hammer or anvil, and I\nwas the kind of donkey who let a woman make a slave of him, do you\nunderstand?\n\n\"The moral of the tale is this: whoever allows himself to be\nwhipped, deserves to be whipped.\n\n\"The blows, as you see, have agreed with me; the roseate supersensual\nmist has dissolved, and no one can ever make me believe again that\nthese 'sacred apes of Benares' [Footnote: One of Schopenhauer's\ndesignations for women.] or Plato's rooster [Footnote: Diogenes\nthrew a plucked rooster into Plato's school and exclaimed: \"Here\nyou have Plato's human being.\"] are the image of God.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Venus in Furs, by Ritter von Leopold Sacher-Masoch\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VENUS IN FURS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6852-8.txt or 6852-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/6/8/5/6852/\n\nProduced by Avinash Kothare, Tom Allen, Tiffany Vergon,\nCharles Aldarondo, Charles Franks and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Shadows slipped down the walls and waited behind every chair.\n\nDid that door move?\n\nNo. She wouldn't go to the Jolly Seventeen. She hadn't energy enough to caper before them, to smile blandly at Juanita's rudeness. Not today. But she did want a party. Now! If some one would come in this afternoon, some one who liked her\u2014Vida or Mrs. Sam Clark or old Mrs. Champ Perry or gentle Mrs. Dr. Westlake. Or Guy Pollock! She'd telephone\u2014\u2014\n\nNo. That wouldn't be it. They must come of themselves.\n\nPerhaps they would.\nWhy not?\n\nShe'd have tea ready, anyway. If they came\u2014splendid. If not\u2014what did she care? She wasn't going to yield to the village and let down; she was going to keep up a belief in the rite of tea, to which she had always looked forward as the symbol of a leisurely fine existence. And it would be just as much fun, even if it was so babyish, to have tea by herself and pretend that she was entertaining clever men. It would!\n\nShe turned the shining thought into action. She bustled to the kitchen, stoked the wood-range, sang Schumann while she boiled the kettle, warmed up raisin cookies on a newspaper spread on the rack in the oven. She scampered up-stairs to bring down her filmiest tea-cloth. She arranged a silver tray. She proudly carried it into the living-room and set it on the long cherrywood table, pushing aside a hoop of embroidery, a volume of Conrad from the library, copies of the Saturday Evening Post, the Literary Digest, and Kennicott's National Geographic Magazine.\n\nShe moved the tray back and forth and regarded the effect. She shook her head. She busily unfolded the sewing-table set it in the bay-window, patted the tea-cloth to smoothness, moved the tray. \u201cSome time I'll have a mahogany tea-table,\u201d she said happily.\n\nShe had brought in two cups, two plates. For herself, a straight chair, but for the guest the big wing-chair, which she pantingly tugged to the table.\n\nShe had finished all the preparations she could think of. She sat and waited. She listened for the door-bell, the telephone. Her eagerness was stilled. Her hands drooped.\n\nSurely Vida Sherwin would hear the summons.\n\nShe glanced through the bay-window. Snow was sifting over the ridge of the Howland house like sprays of water from a hose. The wide yards across the street were gray with moving eddies. The black trees shivered. The roadway was gashed with ruts of ice.\n\nShe looked at the extra cup and plate. She looked at the wing-chair. It was so empty.\n\nThe tea was cold in the pot. With wearily dipping fingertip she tested it. Yes. Quite cold. She couldn't wait any longer.\n\nThe cup across from her was icily clean, glisteningly empty.\n\nSimply absurd to wait. She poured her own cup of tea. She sat and stared at it. What was it she was going to do now? Oh yes; how idiotic; take a lump of sugar.\n\nShe didn't want the beastly tea.\nShe was springing up. She was on the couch, sobbing.\n\nII\n\nShe was thinking more sharply than she had for weeks.\n\nShe reverted to her resolution to change the town\u2014awaken it, prod it, \u201creform\u201d it. What if they were wolves instead of lambs? They'd eat her all the sooner if she was meek to them. Fight or be eaten. It was easier to change the town completely than to conciliate it! She could not take their point of view; it was a negative thing; an intellectual squalor; a swamp of prejudices and fears. She would have to make them take hers. She was not a Vincent de Paul, to govern and mold a people. What of that? The tiniest change in their distrust of beauty would be the beginning of the end; a seed to sprout and some day with thickening roots to crack their wall of mediocrity. If she could not, as she desired, do a great thing nobly and with laughter, yet she need not be content with village nothingness. She would plant one seed in the blank wall.\n\nWas she just? Was it merely a blank wall, this town which to three thousand and more people was the center of the universe? Hadn't she, returning from Lac-qui-Meurt, felt the heartiness of their greetings? No. The ten thousand Gopher Prairies had no monopoly of greetings and friendly hands. Sam Clark was no more loyal than girl librarians she knew in St. Paul, the people she had met in Chicago. And those others had so much that Gopher Prairie complacently lacked\u2014the world of gaiety and adventure, of music and the integrity of bronze, of remembered mists from tropic isles and Paris nights and the walls of Bagdad, of industrial justice and a God who spake not in doggerel hymns.\n\nOne seed. Which seed it was did not matter. All knowledge and freedom were one. But she had delayed so long in finding that seed. Could she do something with this Thanatopsis Club? Or should she make her house so charming that it would be an influence? She'd make Kennicott like poetry. That was it, for a beginning! She conceived so clear a picture of their bending over large fair pages by the fire (in a non-existent fireplace) that the spectral presences slipped away. Doors no longer moved; curtains were not creeping shadows but lovely dark masses in the dusk; and when Bea came home Carol was singing at the piano which she had not touched for many days.\n\nTheir supper was the feast of two girls. Carol was in the dining-room, in a frock of black satin edged with gold, and Bea, in blue gingham and an apron, dined in the kitchen; but the door was open between, and Carol was inquiring, \u201cDid you see any ducks in Dahl's window?\u201d and Bea chanting, \u201cNo, ma'am. Say, ve have a svell time, dis afternoon. Tina she have coffee and knackebrod, and her fella vos dere, and ve yoost laughed and laughed, and her fella say he vos president and he going to make me queen of Finland, and Ay stick a fedder in may hair and say Ay bane going to go to var\u2014oh, ve vos so foolish and ve LAUGH so!\u201d\n\nWhen Carol sat at the piano again she did not think of her husband but of the book-drugged hermit, Guy Pollock. She wished that Pollock would come calling.\n\n\u201cIf a girl really kissed him, he'd creep out of his den and be human. If Will were as literate as Guy, or Guy were as executive as Will, I think I could endure even Gopher Prairie. It's so hard to mother Will. I could be maternal with Guy. Is that what I want, something to mother, a man or a baby or a town? I WILL have a baby. Some day. But to have him isolated here all his receptive years\u2014\u2014\n\n\u201cAnd so to bed.\n\n\u201cHave I found my real level in Bea and kitchen-gossip?\n\n\u201cOh, I do miss you, Will. But it will be pleasant to turn over in bed as often as I want to, without worrying about waking you up.\n\n\u201cAm I really this settled thing called a 'married woman'? I feel so unmarried tonight. So free. To think that there was once a Mrs. Kennicott who let herself worry over a town called Gopher Prairie when there was a whole world outside it!\n\u201cOf course Will is going to like poetry.\u201d\n\nIII\n\nA black February day. Clouds hewn of ponderous timber weighing down on the earth; an irresolute dropping of snow specks upon the trampled wastes. Gloom but no veiling of angularity. The lines of roofs and sidewalks sharp and inescapable.\n\nThe second day of Kennicott's absence.\n\nShe fled from the creepy house for a walk. It was thirty below zero; too cold to exhilarate her. In the spaces between houses the wind caught her. It stung, it gnawed at nose and ears and aching cheeks, and she hastened from shelter to shelter, catching her breath in the lee of a barn, grateful for the protection of a billboard covered with ragged posters showing layer under layer of paste-smeared green and streaky red.\n\nThe grove of oaks at the end of the street suggested Indians, hunting, snow-shoes, and she struggled past the earth-banked cottages to the open country, to a farm and a low hill corrugated with hard snow. In her loose nutria coat, seal toque, virginal cheeks unmarked by lines of village jealousies, she was as out of place on this dreary hillside as a scarlet tanager on an ice-floe. She looked down on Gopher Prairie. The snow, stretching without break from streets to devouring prairie beyond, wiped out the town's pretense of being a shelter. The houses were black specks on a white sheet. Her heart shivered with that still loneliness as her body shivered with the wind.\n\nShe ran back into the huddle of streets, all the while protesting that she wanted a city's yellow glare of shop-windows and restaurants, or the primitive forest with hooded furs and a rifle, or a barnyard warm and steamy, noisy with hens and cattle, certainly not these dun houses, these yards choked with winter ash-piles, these roads of dirty snow and clotted frozen mud. The zest of winter was gone. Three months more, till May, the cold might drag on, with the snow ever filthier, the weakened body less resistent. She wondered why the good citizens insisted on adding the chill of prejudice, why they did not make the houses of their spirits more warm and frivolous, like the wise chatterers of Stockholm and Moscow.\n\nShe circled the outskirts of the town and viewed the slum of \u201cSwede Hollow.\u201d Wherever as many as three houses are gathered there will be a slum of at least one house. In Gopher Prairie, the Sam Clarks boasted, \u201cyou don't get any of this poverty that you find in cities\u2014always plenty of work\u2014no need of charity\u2014man got to be blame shiftless if he don't get ahead.\u201d But now that the summer mask of leaves and grass was gone, Carol discovered misery and dead hope. In a shack of thin boards covered with tar-paper she saw the washerwoman, Mrs. Steinhof, working in gray steam. Outside, her six-year-old boy chopped wood. He had a torn jacket, muffler of a blue like skimmed milk. His hands were covered with red mittens through which protruded his chapped raw knuckles. He halted to blow on them, to cry disinterestedly.\n\nA family of recently arrived Finns were camped in an abandoned stable. A man of eighty was picking up lumps of coal along the railroad.\n\nShe did not know what to do about it. She felt that these independent citizens, who had been taught that they belonged to a democracy, would resent her trying to play Lady Bountiful.\n\nShe lost her loneliness in the activity of the village industries\u2014the railroad-yards with a freight-train switching, the wheat-elevator, oil-tanks, a slaughter-house with blood-marks on the snow, the creamery with the sleds of farmers and piles of milk-cans, an unexplained stone hut labeled \u201cDanger\u2014Powder Stored Here.\u201d The jolly tombstone-yard, where a utilitarian sculptor in a red calfskin overcoat whistled as he hammered the shiniest of granite headstones. Jackson Elder's small planing-mill, with the smell of fresh pine shavings and the burr of circular saws. Most important, the Gopher Prairie Flour and Milling Company, Lyman Cass president. Its windows were blanketed with flour-dust, but it was the most stirring spot in town. Workmen were wheeling barrels of flour into a box-car; a farmer sitting on sacks of wheat in a bobsled argued with the wheat-buyer; machinery within the mill boomed and whined, water gurgled in the ice-freed mill-race.\n\nThe clatter was a relief to Carol after months of smug houses. She wished that she could work in the mill; that she did not belong to the caste of professional-man's-wife.\n\nShe started for home, through the small slum. Before a tar-paper shack, at a gateless gate, a man in rough brown dogskin coat and black plush cap with lappets was watching her. His square face was confident, his foxy mustache was picaresque. He stood erect, his hands in his side-pockets, his pipe puffing slowly. He was forty-five or -six, perhaps.\n\n\u201cHow do, Mrs. Kennicott,\u201d he drawled.\n\nShe recalled him\u2014the town handyman, who had repaired their furnace at the beginning of winter.\n\n\u201cOh, how do you do,\u201d she fluttered.\n\n\u201cMy name 's Bjornstam. 'The Red Swede' they call me. Remember? Always thought I'd kind of like to say howdy to you again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYe\u2014yes\u2014\u2014I've been exploring the outskirts of town.\u201d\n\n\u201cYump. Fine mess. No sewage, no street cleaning, and the Lutheran minister and the priest represent the arts and sciences. Well, thunder, we submerged tenth down here in Swede Hollow are no worse off than you folks. Thank God, we don't have to go and purr at Juanity Haydock at the Jolly Old Seventeen.\u201d\n\nThe Carol who regarded herself as completely adaptable was uncomfortable at being chosen as comrade by a pipe-reeking odd-job man. Probably he was one of her husband's patients. But she must keep her dignity.\n\n\u201cYes, even the Jolly Seventeen isn't always so exciting. It's very cold again today, isn't it. Well\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nBjornstam was not respectfully valedictory. He showed no signs of pulling a forelock. His eyebrows moved as though they had a life of their own. With a subgrin he went on:\n\n\u201cMaybe I hadn't ought to talk about Mrs. Haydock and her Solemcholy Seventeen in that fresh way. I suppose I'd be tickled to death if I was invited to sit in with that gang. I'm what they call a pariah, I guess. I'm the town badman, Mrs. Kennicott: town atheist, and I suppose I must be an anarchist, too. Everybody who doesn't love the bankers and the Grand Old Republican Party is an anarchist.\u201d\n\nCarol had unconsciously slipped from her attitude of departure into an attitude of listening, her face full toward him, her muff lowered. She fumbled:\n\n\u201cYes, I suppose so.\u201d Her own grudges came in a flood. \u201cI don't see why you shouldn't criticize the Jolly Seventeen if you want to. They aren't sacred.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, they are! The dollar-sign has chased the crucifix clean off the map. But then, I've got no kick. I do what I please, and I suppose I ought to let them do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by saying you're a pariah?\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm poor, and yet I don't decently envy the rich. I'm an old bach. I make enough money for a stake, and then I sit around by myself, and shake hands with myself, and have a smoke, and read history, and I don't contribute to the wealth of Brother Elder or Daddy Cass.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2014\u2014I fancy you read a good deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. In a hit-or-a-miss way. I'll tell you: I'm a lone wolf. I trade horses, and saw wood, and work in lumber-camps\u2014I'm a first-rate swamper. Always wished I could go to college. Though I s'pose I'd find it pretty slow, and they'd probably kick me out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really are a curious person, Mr.\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBjornstam. Miles Bjornstam. Half Yank and half Swede. Usually known as 'that damn lazy big-mouthed calamity-howler that ain't satisfied with the way we run things.' No, I ain't curious\u2014whatever you mean by that! I'm just a bookworm. Probably too much reading for the amount of digestion I've got. Probably half-baked. I'm going to get in 'half-baked' first, and beat you to it, because it's dead sure to be handed to a radical that wears jeans!\u201d\n\nThey grinned together. She demanded:\n\n\u201cYou say that the Jolly Seventeen is stupid. What makes you think so?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, trust us borers into the foundation to know about your leisure class. Fact, Mrs. Kennicott, I'll say that far as I can make out, the only people in this man's town that do have any brains\u2014I don't mean ledger-keeping brains or duck-hunting brains or baby-spanking brains, but real imaginative brains\u2014are you and me and Guy Pollock and the foreman at the flour-mill. He's a socialist, the foreman. (Don't tell Lym Cass that! Lym would fire a socialist quicker than he would a horse-thief!)\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed no, I sha'n't tell him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis foreman and I have some great set-to's. He's a regular old-line party-member. Too dogmatic. Expects to reform everything from deforestration to nosebleed by saying phrases like 'surplus value.' Like reading the prayer-book. But same time, he's a Plato J. Aristotle compared with people like Ezry Stowbody or Professor Mott or Julius Flickerbaugh.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's interesting to hear about him.\u201d\n\nHe dug his toe into a drift, like a schoolboy. \u201cRats. You mean I talk too much. Well, I do, when I get hold of somebody like you. You probably want to run along and keep your nose from freezing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I must go, I suppose. But tell me: Why did you leave Miss Sherwin, of the high school, out of your list of the town intelligentsia?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess maybe she does belong in it. From all I can hear she's in everything and behind everything that looks like a reform\u2014lot more than most folks realize. She lets Mrs. Reverend Warren, the president of this-here Thanatopsis Club, think she's running the works, but Miss Sherwin is the secret boss, and nags all the easy-going dames into doing something. But way I figure it out\u2014\u2014You see, I'm not interested in these dinky reforms. Miss Sherwin's trying to repair the holes in this barnacle-covered ship of a town by keeping busy bailing out the water. And Pollock tries to repair it by reading poetry to the crew! Me, I want to yank it up on the ways, and fire the poor bum of a shoemaker that built it so it sails crooked, and have it rebuilt right, from the keel up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014that\u2014that would be better. But I must run home. My poor nose is nearly frozen.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, you better come in and get warm, and see what an old bach's shack is like.\u201d\n\nShe looked doubtfully at him, at the low shanty, the yard that was littered with cord-wood, moldy planks, a hoopless wash-tub. She was disquieted, but Bjornstam did not give her the opportunity to be delicate. He flung out his hand in a welcoming gesture which assumed that she was her own counselor, that she was not a Respectable Married Woman but fully a human being. With a shaky, \u201cWell, just a moment, to warm my nose,\u201d she glanced down the street to make sure that she was not spied on, and bolted toward the shanty.\n\nShe remained for one hour, and never had she known a more considerate host than the Red Swede.\n\nHe had but one room: bare pine floor, small work-bench, wall bunk with amazingly neat bed, frying-pan and ash-stippled coffee-pot on the shelf behind the pot-bellied cannon-ball stove, backwoods chairs\u2014one constructed from half a barrel, one from a tilted plank\u2014and a row of books incredibly assorted; Byron and Tennyson and Stevenson, a manual of gas-engines, a book by Thorstein Veblen, and a spotty treatise on \u201cThe Care, Feeding, Diseases, and Breeding of Poultry and Cattle.\u201d\n\nThere was but one picture\u2014a magazine color-plate of a steep-roofed village in the Harz Mountains which suggested kobolds and maidens with golden hair.\n\nBjornstam did not fuss over her. He suggested, \u201cMight throw open your coat and put your feet up on the box in front of the stove.\u201d He tossed his dogskin coat into the bunk, lowered himself into the barrel chair, and droned on:\n\n\u201cYeh, I'm probably a yahoo, but by gum I do keep my independence by doing odd jobs, and that's more 'n these polite cusses like the clerks in the banks do. When I'm rude to some slob, it may be partly because I don't know better (and God knows I'm not no authority on trick forks and what pants you wear with a Prince Albert), but mostly it's because I mean something. I'm about the only man in Johnson County that remembers the joker in the Declaration of Independence about Americans being supposed to have the right to 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'\n\n\u201cI meet old Ezra Stowbody on the street. He looks at me like he wants me to remember he's a highmuckamuck and worth two hundred thousand dollars, and he says, 'Uh, Bjornquist\u2014\u2014'\n\n\u201c'Bjornstam's my name, Ezra,' I says. HE knows my name, all rightee.\n\n\u201c'Well, whatever your name is,' he says, 'I understand you have a gasoline saw. I want you to come around and saw up four cords of maple for me,' he says.\n\n\u201c'So you like my looks, eh?' I says, kind of innocent.\n\n\u201c'What difference does that make? Want you to saw that wood before Saturday,' he says, real sharp. Common workman going and getting fresh with a fifth of a million dollars all walking around in a hand-me-down fur coat!\n\n\u201c'Here's the difference it makes,' I says, just to devil him. 'How do you know I like YOUR looks?' Maybe he didn't look sore! 'Nope,' I says, thinking it all over, 'I don't like your application for a loan. Take it to another bank, only there ain't any,' I says, and I walks off on him.\n\n\u201cSure. Probably I was surly\u2014and foolish. But I figured there had to be ONE man in town independent enough to sass the banker!\u201d\n\nHe hitched out of his chair, made coffee, gave Carol a cup, and talked on, half defiant and half apologetic, half wistful for friendliness and half amused by her surprise at the discovery that there was a proletarian philosophy.\n\nAt the door, she hinted:\n\n\u201cMr. Bjornstam, if you were I, would you worry when people thought you were affected?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? Kick 'em in the face! Say, if I were a sea-gull, and all over silver, think I'd care what a pack of dirty seals thought about my flying?\u201d\n\nIt was not the wind at her back, it was the thrust of Bjornstam's scorn which carried her through town. She faced Juanita Haydock, cocked her head at Maud Dyer's brief nod, and came home to Bea radiant. She telephoned Vida Sherwin to \u201crun over this evening.\u201d She lustily played Tschaikowsky\u2014the virile chords an echo of the red laughing philosopher of the tar-paper shack.\n\n(When she hinted to Vida, \u201cIsn't there a man here who amuses himself by being irreverent to the village gods\u2014Bjornstam, some such a name?\u201d the reform-leader said \u201cBjornstam? Oh yes. Fixes things. He's awfully impertinent.\u201d)\n\nV\n\nKennicott had returned at midnight. At breakfast he said four several times that he had missed her every moment.\n\nOn her way to market Sam Clark hailed her, \u201cThe top o' the mornin' to yez! Going to stop and pass the time of day mit Sam'l? Warmer, eh? What'd the doc's thermometer say it was? Say, you folks better come round and visit with us, one of these evenings. Don't be so dog-gone proud, staying by yourselves.\u201d\n\nChamp Perry the pioneer, wheat-buyer at the elevator, stopped her in the post-office, held her hand in his withered paws, peered at her with faded eyes, and chuckled, \u201cYou are so fresh and blooming, my dear. Mother was saying t'other day that a sight of you was better 'n a dose of medicine.\u201d\n\nIn the Bon Ton Store she found Guy Pollock tentatively buying a modest gray scarf. \u201cWe haven't seen you for so long,\u201d she said. \u201cWouldn't you like to come in and play cribbage, some evening?\u201d As though he meant it, Pollock begged, \u201cMay I, really?\u201d\n\nWhile she was purchasing two yards of malines the vocal Raymie Wutherspoon tiptoed up to her, his long sallow face bobbing, and he besought, \u201cYou've just got to come back to my department and see a pair of patent leather slippers I set aside for you.\u201d\n\nIn a manner of more than sacerdotal reverence he unlaced her boots, tucked her skirt about her ankles, slid on the slippers. She took them.\n\n\u201cYou're a good salesman,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI'm not a salesman at all! I just like elegant things. All this is so inartistic.\u201d He indicated with a forlornly waving hand the shelves of shoe-boxes, the seat of thin wood perforated in rosettes, the display of shoe-trees and tin boxes of blacking, the lithograph of a smirking young woman with cherry cheeks who proclaimed in the exalted poetry of advertising, \u201cMy tootsies never got hep to what pedal perfection was till I got a pair of clever classy Cleopatra Shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut sometimes,\u201d Raymie sighed, \u201cthere is a pair of dainty little shoes like these, and I set them aside for some one who will appreciate. When I saw these I said right away, 'Wouldn't it be nice if they fitted Mrs. Kennicott,' and I meant to speak to you first chance I had. I haven't forgotten our jolly talks at Mrs. Gurrey's!\u201d\n\nThat evening Guy Pollock came in and, though Kennicott instantly impressed him into a cribbage game, Carol was happy again.\n\nV\n\nShe did not, in recovering something of her buoyancy, forget her determination to begin the liberalizing of Gopher Prairie by the easy and agreeable propaganda of teaching Kennicott to enjoy reading poetry in the lamplight. The campaign was delayed. Twice he suggested that they call on neighbors; once he was in the country. The fourth evening he yawned pleasantly, stretched, and inquired, \u201cWell, what'll we do tonight? Shall we go to the movies?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know exactly what we're going to do. Now don't ask questions! Come and sit down by the table. There, are you comfy? Lean back and forget you're a practical man, and listen to me.\u201d\n\nIt may be that she had been influenced by the managerial Vida Sherwin; certainly she sounded as though she was selling culture. But she dropped it when she sat on the couch, her chin in her hands, a volume of Yeats on her knees, and read aloud.\n\nInstantly she was released from the homely comfort of a prairie town. She was in the world of lonely things\u2014the flutter of twilight linnets, the aching call of gulls along a shore to which the netted foam crept out of darkness, the island of Aengus and the elder gods and the eternal glories that never were, tall kings and women girdled with crusted gold, the woful incessant chanting and the\u2014\u2014\n\n\u201cHeh-cha-cha!\u201d coughed Dr. Kennicott. She stopped. She remembered that he was the sort of person who chewed tobacco. She glared, while he uneasily petitioned, \u201cThat's great stuff. Study it in college? I like poetry fine\u2014James Whitcomb Riley and some of Longfellow\u2014this 'Hiawatha.' Gosh, I wish I could appreciate that highbrow art stuff. But I guess I'm too old a dog to learn new tricks.\u201d\n\nWith pity for his bewilderment, and a certain desire to giggle, she consoled him, \u201cThen let's try some Tennyson. You've read him?\u201d\n\n\u201cTennyson? You bet. Read him in school. There's that:\n\nAnd let there be no (what is it?) of farewell\nWhen I put out to sea,\nBut let the\u2014\u2014\n\nWell, I don't remember all of it but\u2014\u2014Oh, sure! And there's that 'I met a little country boy who\u2014\u2014' I don't remember exactly how it goes, but the chorus ends up, 'We are seven.'\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Well\u2014\u2014Shall we try 'The Idylls of the King?' They're so full of color.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to it. Shoot.\u201d But he hastened to shelter himself behind a cigar.\n\nShe was not transported to Camelot. She read with an eye cocked on him, and when she saw how much he was suffering she ran to him, kissed his forehead, cried, \u201cYou poor forced tube-rose that wants to be a decent turnip!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook here now, that ain't\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, I sha'n't torture you any longer.\u201d\n\nShe could not quite give up. She read Kipling, with a great deal of emphasis:\n\nThere's a REGIMENT a-COMING down the GRAND Trunk ROAD.\n\nHe tapped his foot to the rhythm; he looked normal and reassured. But when he complimented her, \u201cThat was fine. I don't know but what you can elocute just as good as Ella Stowbody,\u201d she banged the book and suggested that they were not too late for the nine o'clock show at the movies.\n\nThat was her last effort to harvest the April wind, to teach divine unhappiness by a correspondence course, to buy the lilies of Avalon and the sunsets of Cockaigne in tin cans at Ole Jenson's Grocery.\n\nBut the fact is that at the motion-pictures she discovered herself laughing as heartily as Kennicott at the humor of an actor who stuffed spaghetti down a woman's evening frock. For a second she loathed her laughter; mourned for the day when on her hill by the Mississippi she had walked the battlements with queens. But the celebrated cinema jester's conceit of dropping toads into a soup-plate flung her into unwilling tittering, and the afterglow faded, the dead queens fled through darkness.\n\nVI\n\nShe went to the Jolly Seventeen's afternoon bridge. She had learned the elements of the game from the Sam Clarks. She played quietly and reasonably badly. She had no opinions on anything more polemic than woolen union-suits, a topic on which Mrs. Howland discoursed for five minutes. She smiled frequently, and was the complete canary-bird in her manner of thanking the hostess, Mrs. Dave Dyer.\n\nHer only anxious period was during the conference on husbands.\n\nThe young matrons discussed the intimacies of domesticity with a frankness and a minuteness which dismayed Carol. Juanita Haydock communicated Harry's method of shaving, and his interest in deer-shooting. Mrs. Gougerling reported fully, and with some irritation, her husband's inappreciation of liver and bacon. Maud Dyer chronicled Dave's digestive disorders; quoted a recent bedtime controversy with him in regard to Christian Science, socks and the sewing of buttons upon vests; announced that she \u201csimply wasn't going to stand his always pawing girls when he went and got crazy-jealous if a man just danced with her\u201d; and rather more than sketched Dave's varieties of kisses.\n\nSo meekly did Carol give attention, so obviously was she at last desirous of being one of them, that they looked on her fondly, and encouraged her to give such details of her honeymoon as might be of interest. She was embarrassed rather than resentful. She deliberately misunderstood. She talked of Kennicott's overshoes and medical ideals till they were thoroughly bored. They regarded her as agreeable but green.\n\nTill the end she labored to satisfy the inquisition. She bubbled at Juanita, the president of the club, that she wanted to entertain them. \u201cOnly,\u201d she said, \u201cI don't know that I can give you any refreshments as nice as Mrs. Dyer's salad, or that simply delicious angel's-food we had at your house, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine! We need a hostess for the seventeenth of March. Wouldn't it be awfully original if you made it a St. Patrick's Day bridge! I'll be tickled to death to help you with it. I'm glad you've learned to play bridge. At first I didn't hardly know if you were going to like Gopher Prairie. Isn't it dandy that you've settled down to being homey with us! Maybe we aren't as highbrow as the Cities, but we do have the daisiest times and\u2014oh, we go swimming in summer, and dances and\u2014oh, lots of good times. If folks will just take us as we are, I think we're a pretty good bunch!\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm sure of it. Thank you so much for the idea about having a St. Patrick's Day bridge.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that's nothing. I always think the Jolly Seventeen are so good at original ideas. If you knew these other towns Wakamin and Joralemon and all, you'd find out and realize that G. P. is the liveliest, smartest town in the state. Did you know that Percy Bresnahan, the famous auto manufacturer, came from here and\u2014\u2014Yes, I think that a St. Patrick's Day party would be awfully cunning and original, and yet not too queer or freaky or anything.\u201dEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1317497", "artist_names": "Ruth Brown", "full_title": "Shake A Hand by\u00a0Ruth\u00a0Brown",

Blackened out of synch knew his time here would soon end with an internal hemorrhaging made aware by the animonstrosity of his frankenstatue presence. No longer would he carry on his shoulders the weight of passion. Nowhere were his next of kin to be found. Automotive surges spilled through the veins below him. Was this the only passage that he could find? Sweat adorned the unmoped of his brow, he couldn\u2019t possibly turn back. His jaws jingled with cold studdering, his stomach bulged mid-metamorphosis, grumbling knot belches, too nervous to look down into the inviting concrete collision. He served himself no other choice.\n\nBetween two mountains that claimed some half assed biblical truth, Cerpin knew better, as it had been etch-a-sketched with the branding of a caveat emptor, scarlett with with rheumatic shakes. Cashed beyond mocking belief, this one last hit would spin him and wring him through the mud. He\u2019d always been denied, but this time he didn\u2019t want to wait outside while the party raged on without him.\n\nThe rail that adorned the top of the bridge pulsated a cape of winced shut-on looking. Cars drove past in amazement. \u201cWho the fuck was that wing nut, doing his trapeze act?\u201d, thought one commuter as he shot by. \u201cAma... mira el muchacho va brincar!\u201d, screamed a thirteen year old girl trying to flag her parents\u2019 attention, racing by in a beat up truck filled brink wise with landscape tools. A few miles up the street, the band played on. Springs coiled tightly in the tendons of his legs... they were ready. His tears smoldered into the afternoon air, no one could stop this now. He wondered in flashback stanzas, omitted from this reality, his body took form... half-moon die cast on a February dive... an emblem for all to see... unamused compound of fractures, brittely awaiting for the portal to open...plummeting in the pupil,craving a mute resolve. \u201dI\u2019ll fucking show them\", gathered a light wind past his face, defecating a verse that sang, \u201cYo ya me voy, y nadien me recordara.\u201d He smiled from his chandelier vantage point, inaudible to the ribbon mic tenderness of his naked iris hearing device. Waiting for the opportunity, wilting in sin... the cat among the pigeons could now pounce back into the arms of his true family. Slicing of one last breath, sparking diamonds in the headlights, forever stained in maroon stamps.\n\nCerpin had always been a little overly possessed by his chimerical scribblings. Between lunch breaks and during class, maybe even in his sleep you would find him drawing neo-cultures, diseased and grotesque. That was the portal he created, getting dirty in the nails, small hairs yanked always a canvas moment waiting in the wings. This served its purpose well, as he was malnourished without the outlet. So vividly they spoke to him, committed to its paper. He never noticed if anyone else could hear them too... no matter really, because it's what they said... and how they said it. they were infatuated with each other from the get of their disturbance. He knocked on doors that everyone else knew had no existence. Spiral notebooks lending variety in the medium. Ouija boarded inch by gasp, slow motion in their claps, center psalm lesions of grandeur... inbred petting within bald of point conceived infatuation, clad in flat ash waiting to be rejected, always waiting to be defective. Un juramento sin forma,....me escape de las montanias, salte veneno... scalpula failed to release. You could say he was whipped by the argot of his outlet. Cerpin Taxt, ever the ardent underdog... and of this was born a pig stye pavilion of dribbling hieroglyphics. He needed to be needed. Longing for scores, unzipped face deformed expatriate. They were meant for each other. They defined one another, and soon they would be one.\n\nWait now... hadn\u2019t this all happened before? Traced back in years. Recalling the events, there was a venom in numerical tries. An autocrat in waiting, unknown to himself even... he started losing grip. The sangfroid hunchback that was held together by electric ligature, was always finding it harder and harder to stay alive, let alone make amends in the eye of his storms. This had happened before.\n\nOn an opaque afternoon, fending for himself, in the wake of a mistake, Cerpin was caught on guard in the line of quarrelling fire. A closed can of inebriation had found its way between his own crosshairs striking him in the cranium. A class of migraine unto itself. Maybe he had asked for it? Maybe it was the excuse he needed to traverse the borderland of clairaudient dwellings. Through aneurysm vespers, in the cabinet were the means. To smithereens of an aching argument, he left the point of impact, yeah he left it for broke to medicate his wounds. Maybe he had made a mistake, but mistakes are what his dreams were made of.\nSupple and warm, came the covers over his body. That handful of morphine his mother left behind when she died sure came in handy. This was the hit that marked the beginning. In and out of reality for one week on end, his residency would live in infamy. It was here that they would first make contact with him, the autocrat in waiting, fighting to stay alive.\n\nHe had been nominated... tagged and placed within the high water flood of twisted necks, banging mainline swan dives and cold gizzard to the easing of his confusion. We had studied his slithering new fangled strut from abroad. True prince among the living dead. A wicker at wits end, sweltering an oracle of muse, stuck upon inoperable amputechture, whose flesh wounds felt him thud the ground each time gangs of obstacle contusions buried him zealot deep in stupor. with his armor of broken skin, he had now become a carcass of caricature immune to the slashing on his right fretted arm, mending a hand me down impression dressed in revenant shards. One who had drunk with the owls, with neuce in left hand, showered by lacerations that poured as loud and quick as sand. Magnet for the wielding of knives, with a handless desert of lapwing practicing on his punching bag heart. stacked against a tidal wave of formative droves, making all his advances imperially morose. Bodies can only take so much wear and tear before they collapse.\n\nNow the hurdles, they stood in q\u2019s dwarfing one another in size and shape. They seemed to throw themselves at his body, puncturing with cesspools, inseminating a passive aggressive whiteout that lit his hair on rooted nerve ending. Mala suerte that reduced him to a rubble of incoherent belligerence. So as not to add to the demons that leached under his socket of eyes, people would walk the other way when they saw him hypnotized. His tongue became a cluster of stolen hinges unable to close sentences. To decipher riddles imbedded in mud. Hunted by a bulletin of linguistics, playing dead for keeps, and it's sick to all who couldn\u2019t see, how he could float to the brink with pain by his side, flirting with the insomnia of daft parasites. You could hear him sing in his sleep,\"Con cada cuerpo que estranes mas, este varco se olvido como a nadar.\" He had been salvaged almost every other time, but this one would brake the foundation that he built from the inside.Unconventional and undeniable. A Tremulant megaphone calls....\n\nThat is until we brimmed the ballots with the grins of bloodlet nominations, punctual and factual. After all he created us. What would we be without our beloved bull legged hex of a leader. An empty throne for the Tremulant regime was an unfitting glove left with pistol grip persuasion. and so our plan unfolded- born of hatchet faced spindles, a conspiracy that reared its mug shot at the shores of nedra queret. A pinched swerve found at the bottom of a manmade throat, that was carved into stalactite teeth, and bandaged with the charm of taffeta webs. To some it was known as the orifice of the underworld;stuffed with loons that helped bat Cerpin's eyes, where endorphins made carnage from an insulant pride. Throughout the years it had become a lair made of murals that drifted out of tar and thin air. Belched of lab coated meat hooks caught on spinal column thorns... found within a planet surrounded by the grave rings of nervosa, with its mote floating on an axis suspended in time. Filled with the remnants of an earth bound portal triangular in scope... where defeated, Cerpin lay growing in some tattered pit of stomach; a convalescent home of croaking entrails, mangled by the pettiness of insignificant others. On this black and white planet roared boils upon its shores, nesting bedwetting for our heir to the throne.\n\nMany a sun did pass before the house of Tremula Metacarpi was to decide upon a new leader, and who better than the aforementioned neo infidel known as Cerpin Taxt. Probably the loneliest hull of a man that we tremulants had ever laid eyes on. He resided in the manacle sect of mundy, one of many small caves that overlooked the shanty town of Rezjua, engrossed in shadows of curdled blades flashing themselves in the broad daylight piss of kinetic cleansing.\n\nWith immense fever we handpicked the irradi excerpts from the guilty library of half-truths. A book of suspended impact. How-to manual that taught seduction through the art of suicide. Chapterless void of crass ultimatums, liberally adopting the monthly blood of human conversions. It was with the aid of this manual that set the snails into a marmoset of momentum. Each page wrapped itself around Cerpin, raping its way into his body. For it was by his hand that that we were damned to live in motion sick stills of bone colored paper. By his ink cult of prods that begot him his only children. Yet the ragman of mundy knew nothing of his next to kin. the ones he abandoned in a stationary of underwater flu. So it had begun with a blunt caress of affection from the Cerphim Neuralgia, who summoned him with a warrant towards the canvas of his face... thus administering a morphined carriage of admission. The gates of thanos were now spread eagle wide.\n\n{Cerpin mumbles a costpital riddle}\n\nThey had imagined me as catastrophic... felt an anxious excrement scathing directions from inside my rib cage. Slouched over pointing Gums at porcelain, aching max occupancy, mocking efficiency. I\u2019m starting not to feel the left side of my face, staring at a field of numb quilted walkers. Mangled around an ectopic horse feed on mute. I\u2019ve painted my limbs with the black of my own ashes. Can\u2019t see the light switch when the lights were torn off, from its canal of wrist cuts. Can\u2019t feel my way past the obvious... must make neck tender... adorn it with perforation... they had imagined me as beaten and disfigured, across a stretched carpet of pink slip deadlines. they beckon from a stomach wall lining, hung by jurors, gaffels at attention.\n\n\u201cYou have been brought here by way of your own device. you stand there drenched in guilt, a sentence you can not deny. To the outer reaches you will find find bipolar chance. You are hereby banished for the crime of attempt. Aboard the televator hides, the ESP will take you by the serving of your time,\u201d spoke the gentle infant voice of unhydriate... purgatory strategist. Perpetual lepers who protected the checkmates. \u201cTo draw bedpost sight from deathbed dirt,\u201d chanted the lepers with their map fresh out of wrinkles, fallen face penance first. Mosaic intervals jonesing imminent mistakes,\u201cfollowed by the stilting of glass candle lights\u201d, they wept.\u201cFor tunnels will lend you a route of repenting escape\u201d they kept chanting, repeating hymns into the esp impure... \u201cthree cuts into the slattern conscience lurks the altan sarsen elections\u201d intervened the Tremulants in a whispering of thought, observing the trials from their maddox oracle \u201cdragging a fire under the sheets of sadav commania\u201d rebutted the Tremulants unseen to the lepers...\u201cwhere you will reach a fear,\u201d continued the lepers, \u201cthat mirrors a view that is closer than it appears, in your sleep where you will find the greatest of all lies... the insignificance of others...\u201d\n\nAnd such was their sentence. Prescription unfilled left clenching in my hand. What was it that I had done? I could not remember. Where was I going? The lepers had said their piece and all across the the council of unhydriate, the eyes had it. They prepared my craft in which i was to travel in. Adorned it with amoebas as a means of autopilot automation, for it was reapers who would man the ship. fastened on a seat of arachnids that swarmed my face and penetrated my mouth so as to gut me of cabin pressure. By the time the spiders had tied my body down I began to feel my eyes secret steam and blood. I felt my equilibrium trade places with my lungs. My feet became walls my back ruptured open with choirs of latitude, flapping wings that had spread an ephemeral rush that began to convert my into a hibernating jet propelled larvae. I squirmed into position, vomiting rigor mortis settling in, and then it happened. A grapnel of thick neon quagmire shot open and sank me through the continuum of time and space itself.\n\nThe lepers had successfully accomplished their task, in their punishing of my wayward act. From their lodges of sweat sang the gallows birds of unhydriate. Singing songs of excommunication into a scape of infra recon spectra probation. Lunged into nightmare inside the ESP impure. It was the attempt that fell victim to the shackles in this limitless soar, voicing the stark plea of, \u201cLet us nurse this viper in the bosom of your sewers.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpeso en la sala de tivrones, un pais escrito con el noche. From the prickpatch of poppy fields exhumed under the tremble of lock and key. On this deaf night of crossed eyes... donde me perde. My first attempt will cripple at the door of atrophy, ests son las viajes antes que me fui...\u201d - Cerpin Taxt\n\nson et lumiere;\nClipside of the pinkeye flight I\u2019m not the percent you think survives.

Gestating with all the other rats, nurse said that my skin will need a graft, I am of pock marked shapes, the vermin you need to loathe...\ninertiatic esp;\nNow I\u2019m lost... now I am lost. Last night I heard lepers, flinch like birth defects, it\u2019s musk was fecal in origin as the words dribbled off of its chin, it said, \u201cI\u2019m lost... now I am lost...\u201d Dolls wreck the minced meat of pupils, cast in oblong arms length. The hooks have been picking their scabs, where wolves hide in the company of men. It said, \u201cI\u2019m lost.....now I am lost...\u201d Are you peaking in the red? Perforated at the neck. What of this mongrel architect, a broken arm of sewers set, past present and future tense; clipside of the pink eyed fountain... \u201cNow I\u2019m lost... now I am lost,\u201d it\u2019s been said, long time ago you\u2019ll be the first and last to know.... you\u2019ll never know... you\u2019ll never know.\n{fetal positioned in the stalking yard}\n\nHis pupils twitched lightly, subtle panic aroused in his crystal eyes. Found himself in a sore of molastic putrescence that covered him entirely. It appeared to be a placenta like cocoon, that tore itself out of a pore in the cement. Procured by a heat lamp of dry heaves, misplaced in an oil slick of coat hangers, that lanced off the beggars torso slit yard, with its rusted cars, barrel fires and vagrant argot. \u201cI too haven\u2019t eaten for days,\u201d said the bum clutching warmth by the barrel outside. They had seen brighter days, minus cutty sark pauses, in and out of cells in their empty slit pocket. \u201cWhat of the quarters that house the weary bones of tranquil fatigue, where might I find a bed of sand to stake my keep\u201d Cerpin asked, unable to get a response... long pause continued... fingers unable to commit to the pointing. Seasonal winds made amends with the inquiry, draining a draft that turned his attention to a dilapidated boxcar swaying, shuttering in the dark and empty slit yard. The silence grew deafening, eye contact impaled on a nail of denial. \"Pull up a rail. It rumbles with the girth of early bird squeals,\" said one vagrant, \u201cPonte trucha\u201d, said the other.\n\nThe jettisoned grounds seemed damp with lethargy, crisp with eggshell walks. Careful not to graze the taste that grew restless, mouthing off this sleeping leviathan. Without question, adorned by the heckling winks of the vagrants, Cerpin made his way to the jaundiced colored boxcar. It looked like a prescription bottle filled with tablets of multi colored seagulls. Trapped inside were the shrieks of lap steel cackles, half hearse, half tree stump unearthed were heard. It sat there maliciously waiting with splintering inner jokes. \u201cSi no te importa me duermo aqui,\u201d coughed Cerpin, ready to close shop, shrinking his styes. \u201cThree corneas, two feet, septic skin and gimp swagger\u201d crooned one vagrant. \u201cQue chingaos quere deser eso?\u201d snapped Cerpin. \u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he sneered back centrifugally hoarse in premonition. \u201cIt is the lepers who sing out the sentencing that brought you here, as you harbor rabid saunces, swimming up the portal of tomorrow\u2019s dead tongues\u201d claimed that thick scented homeless gravel, trembling binge tremors.\n\nIn the distance... something drew closer and closer to the slit yard, circling around the bed where Cerpin Taxt laid. It replicated prowl cars closing the kill, eyebrows perked in wonder, yet unconscious and deceitful. \u201cI need to sleep off the unease that queses this howling metal buffalo\u201d...and as sleep crept in, the doors choked closed with a card sharpened crack, awaken by shivers and millipede tacks. Strobe lighting manic submission, where murder premeditated as conversation, ran on a lynching of phonetic hurdes. Trampolened by empty streets \u201cQue hermoso eres sin tu cara,\u201d fisseld the virulent poison. Panic fetched to a writhing......walls and ceilings made canyons out of my body. Jagged wood sculpted cuts in all the right places, smiling in flesh water burials, decapitated shrugs in headless lust isles. \u201cHow could this happen, I\u2019m in a trunk welted by pencors planted as decoys, sticky syphillistic up the neck of cranes and nightingale files...where I\u2019d sooner drink the poison\u201d...paced the voice in his head, neck broken of grunts, from roller coasted rattles unkept in this new found hostel. \u201cWhat sort of train have i slept in tonight?\u201d....his mother then held him and said, \u201cYou have arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201cStumbled upon a slipstream of stubble and rash urine stains, where the warming of marrow drew comfort from this blanketless train. An insulin coma, bearing the mark of Tremula Metacarpi; an executrix at play in the cargo of Thanos\u201d - anonymous\n\nroulette dares{ the haunt of...};\nTransient jet lag ecto mimed bison, this is the haunt of roulette dares.

Broke into the cylinder rings, now nervosa was set catatonic and spent... \u201cTira me a las aranas! rompe me el osico! di me....di me ....vete ala chingada!\u201d I screamed suddenly awakened skidding hollow disorientation, left squirming with pulsing rust barter, raised the dice of entrails as a white flag... yet I had been stapled to the deck of a refuse barge, gagging on the fumes of embalming fluids. Lost in shallow mote. Pinned down by whom it may concern, and there were others. Squeals for help need not apply, for not a soul was heard for miles. But how was I too to feel the lathering of conversations past, teething of infantile pants, clawed fingers scraped against the hush of broken craft... under their breath the length of waves untuned... scattered helm of safeties perception. My ear canals did not lie, there was something there, baiting me for the instance. my designated means kept slamming up against what i made out to be other ships, but I really couldn\u2019t tell from my position. All i knew was that the impacts occurred every three minutes or so. I was shut down by inhalants floating about, when i thought to myself, \u201cThis is fait accompli by the evening.\u201d Forming incisional tunnel vision, where I could only see upwards, I began to try to toss and turn, so that I could break free from the grip of the staples... three inches deep and three inches wide. I wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nThat night as it was permanent night, I feel asleep to the rumble hunger unseated in my works. Passed out from the heat and began hearing the voices again. Only this time they were left of center in the distance, almost talking in their sleep. Jerked from slumber, one of the other ships had rammed my barge, tearing my back from the hold of the staples, as the small of my back, shined popped blisters filled of raw pink skin. With my right arm free, I gained strength and pulled my upper body from the clench bitten of staples. The night breeze scorched the skin of its virgin paper, and broke it into a scab colored branding, birthmarked to the bone. I looked around in utter silence.\n\nDown below me I could see a black and white sphere... sullen and unnerving. Floating in a graveyard of abandoned submarines that circled the magnificent dot as a ringed mote. Had I been here before? What sort of deja vu was it tricking in my scalp?... Like a picture that I had d... r... a... all this and still not a single person in sight. I didn\u2019t know how much longer to take it. Every breath I took taxed me. I slayed meager to the second. Only had the salt water of the rings to fill my tired body with. Then I heard them again. Footsteps belittled by laughter. I jumped onto another sub, and followed my concrete sense of radar, but couldn\u2019t pin point where it was coming from. From vessel to vessel, until I fell on a APL K19 Russian sub. It was riddled with pagan alphabet graffiti... empty. The water began to shiver in a frenzy, and before I knew it, the whole mote was awash rapid; a convulsion storm. I hid inside the K19, while a hail outside began to fester. Thunderous gaps of passages relieved itself from above, slinging itself at the water, hemorrhaging epical proportions. A tell tale noise swore down leveling... I saw them all... a thresher 593\u2019s skylarking in belly flopped strolls... Widowmakers... a U.S.S. Waltzer... every unliving kind of sub possible. Through the scope of the K19, with flinches, it precipitated a monumental wreckage, laying waste to the landfill.. when the calamity had subsided, I ventured outside. There it fucking was... vessel impaled upon vessel, scathing a hue silhouette of rats birthing through mouths, tail ribbed insertion of catheter mountains left menstruating on vessel upon vessel, diuretic in conception... phlegmed of scrap heap clumps. Overpopulated dysentery spills. Where had it all come from, soaking up the water growing scarcely visible. I was able to construct pathways from the debris that littered itself everywhere. Leapt onto a copper tinted sub given the moniker ECTOS 333. Plucked from seaside, same as the others... nobody home. Was I the only one there? I glanced to the left and spotted a slogan written on the side of the boat. It was a bit undecipherable, covered by years of decay, weather worn wet and peeling. I squatted down for a closer read...it said...\u201cIt is decided that all gods must die... so as to maintain social and cosmological order, moattilliatta remains merciful and vengeful.\u201d I really hadn\u2019t the faintest idea. I knew nothing of this superstitious ramble tangent inconsistency; perhaps of a populist consensus. No comprehension as to why I could even read it, seeing as how it was written in a language never seen or heard of before.\nHeld my patience for the voices to bubble up again, but all grew quiet,all remained calm. Strolled along the other subs, in search of food, blankets anything really. Must have traveled around in leap years for what seemed like forever. The loneliness collected in resin filled corners, smeared up and down these ghastly waters. A permanence of night can do wonders for the imagination I and didn\u2019t need more of it. Cramp laked the jostling and brittle coating of my bones, sank sicker to a stick, made up of mirage bruises. Clotted myself, chewed on my own skin. drifting in and out, fits of repetition. Fell drowsy frail and heavy... heavy on the eyes... heavy on the palms... heavy on the concrete... heavy towards the light... plastering vagueness brushing along swaying... immediately I came to, finding myself engulfed by the voices. Verse vacuum I had to make a brake for it. I began shoveling across the mourners, crimping at the alarms, looking for a safe house. Frantic gibberish spurting inconspiritly, swallowing tongue, swept for shelter, gutted bloated and tired. Had to find the K19 to hide my hyde from the spare part fallout. Sure its frame could withstand such a pounding... and from the heavens sliced open an entry, in the grimacing downpour glistened of hades. Near its defecation peak, I managed to see the winking from afar. Felt my arms torque forward the stealth of all appendages... ran in formation towards primate arching, swallowing terrain whole, marking my target. Hurd sprint the photo finish like a motherfuck. I\u2019d be damned to get propellered... back of my skull spawned sirens at full tilt. Imminent 30 seconds of mote. only one more sub... and there she was sight for the sorest of all eyes, elbowed out of pivots. Turned my cranium in a gaulk at the charcoal lit sky. Taken for granted were the jets summoning from the skies, because not only was this place filled with submarines,but also it layed of transportation scrimmaged of mileage, bowing 747\u2019s, single engine cesna\u2019s, a towing pelt that thwarted a vanished account of junk piles... this is where they all came to....crashing all around me. Cramp struck in arm again, phoenix craft and carpel throbs, aloud snow lotion stalks... my last dash made from a leap of faith... lid shut tight at the soles of my feet. Would I make it this time? Eyes shut from terror, think I lost control of my function. Pigmented pearl at a harbor... padding a cell of my own. Sat there petrified overhead the collisions, as it gashed open the siege of all missing ships... safety in numbers, in them where I hid. The interface wreck sealed shut the entrance of my K19. Now the only fucking problem was opening it. It rained for three straight hours. Forming overhead through the scope, I observed a layer of dry ice residue made from a dead vessel collage.\n\nI made it... or had I really. Claustraphonic circumprison was I running out of air? The K19 could no longer re-enter the atmosphere in question, and with choices guzzled on empty, I fell into exhaustion throwing in the towel. \u201cAla verga!\u201d...I whimpered.....\u201cI\u2019ll just sit here till they rescue me\u201d...I kidded myself, swaying mental patiently. \u201cI\u2019ll just keep tellin myself that I\u2019m ok\u201d....\u201csomeone ...will...come....\u201d snaped into sobs, followed by hysterics, maimed with laughter. This shit was endless. For the pecking, I too became a voice in the pond. Eyes rolled back solitary in confinement. Unglued in its eternal waltz, slowly my being transparent, clocked out. All that was left was a puddle made of spit. Heavy on the eyes... grew heavy on the eyes...\n\n\u201cIf you paddle away, you know we\u2019ll find and put you back in this vesicle colony of mute vernacular. No dramatic means of fencing against this solitary sickness. As it precipitates flare gun shots. Coughing into the armpit of a mecharest home because when it rains, you know it pours\u201d - the mongrel tarants\n\ntira me a las aranas;\ndrunkship of lanterns;\nYou\u2019ve got the lot to burn. A shelve of pig smothered cries. Is there a spirit that spits upon the exit of signs? Is anybody there?\n\nThese steps keep on growing long. Bayonet trials rust propellers await...No...Nobody is heard, rowing sheep smiles for the dead. Nobody is heard..an antiquated home. A float with engines on mute. Sui generis ship spined around the yard. Is anybody there ? These craft only multiply. At the nape of ruins rust propellers await... No... Nobody is heard, compass wilting in the wind. Nobody is heard. Rowing sheep smile for the dead. Transoceanic depth in this earth - in this cenotaph. Lash of one thousand eye brows clicking. Counting the toll. Counting the toll.

Vocal chords denied breath, pallid with metric licking. In this fog, it provoked me a new name, by the skin of ghemora hotel, I thought that I had escaped...key phrase being \u201cI thought\u201d. Snowing gave way to flinches in this tube bolted screen. I had accelerated the growth of the esp continuum through fracturing hecatomb washes scraping my fiber, with manual incentive. The esp had allowed me once again to transgress lateral dementia, radarless chameleons beating a path for the bleep on this screen. Leaving behind one body and pouring back into an exothermic version of another. Found inside out taping a transparency of hail everywhere. Viciously I swam through clear muk molten props in amelting fallout of nothingness....humming germs....voluptuous insignia sewn out of thoroughbreds. Left a trail of memories to try and figure out how to get back. Felt dusted to the niles. A racket in the chamber, smiling to me an assurance of \u201cYou really needn\u2019t breath anymore, look around you...it is devoid of function.\u201d\n\nFaith vanishings, hence the litter passing by muttering underbreath, and waterlike. I thought someone might still be able to spot me...testator nomadic. Trailing a tail of trick mirrors, hyperventilating as I did past my own temple. The burning sank a fade as I swam deeper into the listening...\"all of this time bedsore containment, where am I now that the music has faded.\u201d Enraptured in vicoden tucks, kennel swarms of cumulonimbus dogs ran through my delusion, was I just making it up or was there a maelstrom of pets, impending a gush upon me? With wet warm towels in went blank retina awol, guess I\u2019d gotten use to that. Narchromeleptic fever pictures unripe for the recon. Traveled on sick leave beds through out these pages. Apparently a hustle and bustle wanked freely beneath my manupod, or was I on an operating table ? The smell of sterile gauze gave abscess dripping, disinfectant for the ruckus below grunting of lap dance foam and limbless muts, scanned the floors below me hinting painted me immobile. A life support christened me helpless, with one surgeon standing over me. \u201cYou have the body of a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cand you the clumsy hands of a novice,\u201d I snapped, emaciated by the confidentiality casing that choked me claustrophobe affection. \u201cHow long have I been under?\u201d...hoping for something real....\u201cWho ever said you woke up ?\u201d\n\nNow I recognized where the voices came from. Found face to hound, leant in for an answer. \u201cWe had to lure you here somehow,\u201d the doctor smirked. \u201cThese unruly abominations are the ones who guided you here. Not much in the way of looks, yet plenty to gaulk at...they speak beautifully, dont you agree?\u201d Fucking monster had a cunning hint about him, smoldering calm reserve, with rows of teeth up his sleeve. I needed to know how the animals spoke to me in the rings. \u201cShow me how you storm ventriloquiy at the wind, fasting particle past the mum of of past participles?\u201d I grew stubborn and shitfaced of medicine. Labotomized in the frances ward, \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d carpet aroma sailing of burnt crisp hair. \u201cThat would be you my feathered friend.\u201d Found my veins startling annoyed of form, ejected in an emulsion taxidermi still....drawn and quartered. \u201cWhat have you done to my body\u201d...\u201cAll for the better moattilliatta...you will fly again.\u201d He spoke with such determination. his speech seem to intoxify my adrenalin rush, dumbing me demeral flash heat.\n\nWolfram Tarant as i would read on his name tag in peripherals, was the name of the infectant MD, a quacking malpractice advocate whose very name was synonymous with butchery. His offices, located on the fault lines of the vocifur euphrates entangled itself in a splendorous sedative impunity as it was masked a camouflage of stiple teleferance. This worked to his advantage, with no outside intervention. His services had been requested by the mentiads, which was an alias for the tremulants. Bounty hunters if you will. But without surgical skill they could not perform the proper surgery needed on Cerpin. The task was simple- \"by order of red tezcatlipoca- base tendon to the high order of tremula metacarpi- unleash the last of the great teraquetzals - spare no blood-fit like glove.\u201d\n\nWhen duty called with bounty and receipt, the payment made a mockery as to the relevance of Cerpins body. Wolfram chased around the room. Fantasies wired his eyes immense and unethical, as if consumed by a dictation of good posture and common decency. \u201cYou will reach the highest peaks of jackal children sacrifice, rain fingers down, in a bath of blood.....\u201d He shook with priapic vigor. I couldn\u2019t fight it. Attached to machinery, cowardice became shock. The good doctor had a healing touch. His hands lapped at my wounds for fingers he had none. Attached to his wrists were the heads of mongrels tearing at my flesh. Nursing it to wealth. No silver scalpels, but filthy dogs that winked the stare of exlovers past, present and sutured tense. \u201cWhy have you done this to me?\u201d...\u201cYou did this to yourself...besides it is merely an option,\u201d creaked a slovenly grin lip. \u201cOnce you taste it, there\u2019s no turning back\u201d I didn\u2019t understand. The wingspan of my speech began shrieking cringes. \u201cTranquilo escraboso, tranquilo.\u201d \u201cWhat choices do you speak of!\u201d i demanded. \u201cObserve restless one, observe.....on your cornea will appear the image of your sworn enemy. A bricktank in the final installation of your discontent. An obese boar who goes by koral mataxia. This foul tempter, commissioned by the tremulants will find his holves enjoying the fruits of your endeavors. He is to steal your most beloved, and you are you are to allow him to do so with little opposition.\u201d Wolfram seemed to stray. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for him where would tremula be, I forsee with pleasure...there must be organization in this chaos. do what thou wilt spreads very thinly...our very existence depends on your wrath\u201d I didn't understand. \u201cYour greatest losses will fan this very flame.\u201d Fermium waves of cancerous leaches sucked me dry of a fight. I did not believe him. Wolfram began shouting, \u201cCursed are the genes of your cathartic existence! It was written and so shall it be. how perfect your prototype of nihilistic expenditure. A true prince among the living dead.\u201d My doubts increased with voltage. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn back, you haven\u2019t got the courage.\u201d Wolfram insisted, replacing my arms with wings cast out in this orgy of uncut gordian knots. \u201cflooded you will grieve at an institutional romance, engulfed in a rage of jealous activity. she will evoke your self destruct only after you have struck,\u201d he beamed in soapoperative legislation. \u201cWe will provide you with the gate, it is you who has to make the choice, I trust my custom job will convince you of your self worth...join us and leave them all behind. can you deny this crown, peasant ranting for torture in the fixing of pure decadence.\u201d\n\nBack in Rezjua, semantics sanded down the morale at the gathering sympathizers who rallied around Cerpins body. The amount of morphine that he ingested was enough to appropriate his state further and further, to the verge of permanent psychosis .The tremulants claimed a forfeiture of property......that of the temple of his body...starting with his comprehension,....were they convincing him? Some prayed, some paced, some knew that the worst was yet to come. Messages kept scrawling out of his mouth......tempting a belief that everything was alright. Those closest to him held their breath..... aA jewel like no other was about to be stolen, and of all the treasures they had to pick from theirs.... It was enough to make you laugh at the defiling martyrdom of a petty catholic guilt. He had yet to live his slogan, making his way through prune wrinkeld omens...hibernating in gums, rationed and chattering. As was his logic to box your own response. What was it that Wolfram was foaming at the hands about? Cerpin came in and out of his sleep, his body sat up in the emergency room found elbow deep in the clasp. More of his friends gathered, ,fusing a residential vigil, praying for his soul. He mutated double speak, an oar sinking not knowing where it was. Everyone slouched torn of pale witness to an apparation. Please come back to us. just as he started making out the images, he awoke back into the arms of Wolfram Tarant, unable to break the morphine tackle that found him dead asleep. The dogs paraded back and forth underneath speaking at his wings. Cerpins body was now of normal cosmetics, no longer a butchers shop...trimmed of fat on the ground. No more probing or slicing. He felt rested. He sat and smiled, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d...unable to remember. The dogs began to speak in unison tones, sirens of shriveled mutiny. \u201cWhen will you come convulsing to my basement?\u201d- Dr. Wolfram Tarant\n\neriatarka;\nAnd there are those who hadn\u2019t found the speaking so wrong,is it wrong? Of pavolov lore, they ran rampant through the floors, is this wrong ? Feels so wrong... happened on a respirator in the basements.Are they gone? Are they gone?...

The heat that rose from biege ashes kneeled many a victim over in a temperature purging quick to dismantle from evaporation. Where was it that Cerpin had found himself now? The desert climate was an obvious given, but who was he. His mind had been erased of all thoughts. To himself a series of clicks and guttural moans laced his speaking patterns. What was happening to him? He looked down at his arms.... as there were many. He tried scratching his head in disbelief, but his hands floated right through his body. The gell that incased his body fell in drops of blue transparent tingles that fell upwards to the sky then disappeared. He felt an itching warmth on the roof of his mouth every time he tried to speak. He opted to ditch the clicking grunts in favor of the long moans that drew instant gratification. This form of communication resembled sounds of sea life; sonar catalyst breaching the law underfoot. Behind him were the remains of disemboweled corpses. Two antlike creatures with human facial features carved in its back, where in plain view of Cerpin....however Cerpin was no longer his name, and for that matter he was a she. Clavietika Tresojos as she was branded, commenced her floating waltz across the dunes killing everything in her path, and with just reason. All that was Cerpin Taxt could no longer be seen. She danced aimlessly on the sand towards sleeping villages, with liberation on her lips and death in her pouch, granting the wish of lust everlasting. The creatures left for dead on the ground sank slowly into the sand, about eight feet wide with antennas mounted on its head-piece. The faces on its back were charred with the shade of struggle, while its legs were cranked backwards broken and dangling..and its eyes, yes its eyes had been cut from the sockets and found in their mouths.... closed in a mouthful, daydreamt episodes traumaligned-content. Not a warning but a realization for the others-as this was their future. Clavietika glided away without a single drop of blood on her..forever clean with the power of painted speech; subliminal entity ethinically cleansing...three knocks on the door for housekeeping.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never know dehydration, the likes that shape inside my nap, carriaging from seven until never, posted on the dunes, has been with struggles. I\u2019m hung and over, hunted cained unable from histamined strokes, allergic to your larynx as you pull it from your throat. Convincing a fluent spell, look upon my gaze, does this scribble portrait allure you to come and join the heap? Splendid it is when you finally feel the the breaking. You are fitted follicles from scalp to blush; salutation blessed by landing sleep. In the horizon, you\u2019ll spill brethren to the voluntary, miniscule insectavation on the trunk of deserts. More than just a fathom flogging parlor, renovating guilloroutines,sedetiviat calling mauled canvas. Painted in impaliours, weak in comparison is the pain that you seek. Brushed along paralyzion, I\u2019ll make things contrary to your opiated meat. I\u2019ve got that impounding sand quivering up the wormholes, cause the phixias got binge of my scent; masticated under framed hunt. Wanted out of mostly euthencide. Gimme one look to the future, and I\u2019ll crumble with slight of sigh. Confunstrukt-genusect windducts are spoiled and surrendered mutilacksation, now start with the pockets unbridled looking.....be it everywhere for everyone. Cutting from your stations of the crossed, a creeping mess is close to gaudiness\"\n\n{bring me the head of Clavietika Tres Ojos}\n\nAnd this is what her painting said, minus rhetorical lapsus scaffolding. Stunned by images, she\u2019d against ash in the gambling sand. Hypnoquatic trance from the verberateing look, submissive to the sound of her painting voice. This crippled my tips, receptor picking up jammed communicatios, but when it came to her slander we just had to implode...eyes first of course. Flamed the palms shuttered at breakneck teases. That was the plan implemented, bring her to me as recherche spoke. We took orders quite well, never questioned the pamphlets...maybe that\u2019s why we gave in so easily,...just never had the fight in us. Yet we were bred to fight amongst each other like narcs in tattle tale mode. \u201cMarxaniala-tecla illuminosa,soil qurac guard,\u201d I shouted into my talk back pore. This was the standard procedure that we followed when calling for back up....like we really needed it. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a phixia cadre on the horizontal prayer of the magnifying glass in three decibel inclines,\u201d said hq back to me. \u201cMay recherche rest his tired bones,\u201d i thought....spotting this type of blasphemy always meant more phixias would die. We were on her fucking ass, heat sunk by intuition. We were gonna sack her back to the quarac. They had ways of muzzling her down, but everytime the phixia quarantine managed to get their antler pencors near her she, out of death, would duplicate instantly. Clavietikas were always up for the fight ,and us phixias picked bones for a living. Our encounters usually ended in an abortive marriage of afterlife,that taunted a punishing blow.\n\nSomething told us that this Clavietika was the mother hechicera. The one that sheltered Ojeno Valaso...fallen ceraphim and creator divine of the opposing side. His design was almost flawless. He made her with just the right touch. She was a double headed muti-random shaped appendage with lateral appendix impervious to hurt in the elastic form of an astral projected body. Translucent in her structure, deceitful and impregnable with the power of deforming, and the stare of defamation-court jestering suggestive suicide...a page torn from irradi exerptas. One word and you were dead. One drop that made a convincing argueless impression...and you would turn on yourself. Starting with the eyes of course. Sowvietna held a counter institutionary liberator in her belly and the Clavietika knew she was sweeping dirt in her eyes. It was a matter of seconds before we would catch her. Recherche had no schematics, only a starving window pain, that throbbed for an end to it all.\n\nOjeno Valaso and Recherche Bellicose were at one time inseparable. The pettiness of gossip, the competitive streaks, not even the sharing of lovers could separate them. There was a bond sewn together by a phantasmagoric aesthetic; los tres ojos {to obtain enlightenment. Ignoring temptations from the left and the right... the middle eye focused illuminously},ragman {hermit for the studying of survival}, and dead doll stares {the piercing gaze with which to paint your enemy dead}. Funny how history forgets to absolve its captors of their sin. The groping handle infixed between a shanking knife held by the both of them forged the land. \u201cFrom ruins to anthills,\u201d was heard, and with it came the new beginning. Prosperity inched its way over the sands of Sowvietna. But like all tell tales, the tranquility would come to a swift end. In the harvest month of krona, twenty years after the Sowvietna civil war, it all went terribly wrong. Pallbearing a turn in the sheen highlighting Recherches\u2019 twitching eye, Ojeno would be the first to stab a friend in the back. Ojeno began noticing the brevity with which he began dealing with others. He grew fat with power, and as drunk with leisure as any glutten would given the access of total ownership. But was sowvietna his? Ojeno didnt seem to think so. Members of his cabinet seemed to vanish into the melted paper sand. People went missing at an all time high....and the streets fell desolate, tumbleweed populous unheard in the gasp. It was said that to look Recherche in the eye was punishable by hanging. All holidays were omitted from the calendar. Uniforms became mandatory. Loin cloths over black electric tape body suites, wrapped to a mummy shape. The mother tongue was banned, no one was to speak ectal, which naturally rolled off the antennas. A series of short germanic hand codes, equipped with click-hissing, and emotionless bravado became mandatory by law. Vietnic as it was so bitterly installed, became the lisp that corrected our roots. Ectal was ten-thousand times more elegant in its long vowels, soaring pronunciated- submerged tone that mimicked the ocean whales, a beauty now long and forgotten. It was rumored that Recherche with his medically corrected speech impediment, in asshole operandi, wanted a language that was marked of his inflection and muddy drawl. A code of his own doing square wheeled chewing marbles in the mouth. Sow vietna had made a term for the worst. This is why Ojeno vowed never again to follow the path they never applied. What happened to them? Recherche began public executions for those un willing to commit to the diet of Sowvietna. Volunteers would be treated more Phixiately than those caught running for the borders. Impaleliours are what they called them. They were exactly what they sounded like. hoisted high onto the quarac totem pole, ever so sharply they would slide down until their inner sanctions would jumble to a stop. On these carved poles, splintered and congested, hooverd a glass eye immense in size. It emitted a ray of light on the impaliours below it. Ashes fell to the floor burnt by the glass magnified in captivity. With it came the pigment of the phixias dress. Face painted by honour. These executions were one of the turning points for Ojeno. In a matter of years he would defect.\n\n\u201cOnly devils might care, yet you run with with tales of fibbing scrutiny, somnolent breather, now its time to let it crack. You only run from yourself,\u201d laughed the Phixia with antennas glowing. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get a bonus for this one\u201d, he grunted back gargling his blow hole shut by stitches. The Phixias had been tracking this poor soul down for hours. They outnumbered the child three to one. He had been beaten like a bully sack on grated shreds, sitting hopeless and endangered. They walked away for a breather, letting him slightly recover from the pulp of disconnecting bones, slagged off broken and open. In a matter of minutes they would strap him to the faces of their elongated backs, and take them him back to the Quarac. There he would be reconditioned in a re-education camp. Year zero taught properly, a volunteer for the impaliours. \u201cAny sign of that Clavietika ?\u201d asked one Phixia strapping the child in backpack configuration. \u201cRadio into HQ, see if she\u2019s flying low enough to be caught on the radar, i could use the extra pay.\u201d Spoken like a true grunt. He had no clue as to the physical trauma that it took to hunt one of those things down. \u201cLet\u2019s hurry up, the night icicles fall fast upon us. We needn\u2019t set camp and set water on the brain.\u201d They hurried back to the prison Quarac, blasting shifts in penance, chained among gangs. Phixias crush everything in their path, women and children first, no taboo was too much. This is how they learned to live in these hugger mugger times. If you as much as hushed a single unphixia like thought, you would be banished to the Quarac as an impaleliour. To run with the Phixias, one must think as a group never as a single rhythm. \u201cYou will make a great impaleliour, just give it here, we need your corpse for fresh face paint\u201d. Clobbered sensceisly, the young child gave them not the satisfaction of defeat. \u201cYou didn\u2019t knock me out, you neckless, fucking stump\u201d. Gears jerked from the gully, intrepid and conniving, they killed him on impulse alone. Sardined matches, as yet to be let out. They took commands from his ulcers, crop circle phenomena plastered propaganda, lubricant on the hides, compensation for the better of the land. On every shelter a warning- how to look, breath and eat. Narcs were escorted with encouragement, the Phixias were watching all the time.\n\nClavietika used the ice of nightfall to rejuvenate herself. In the morning began her rampage amongst all things Phixia. They could not find where she hid last night, unaware that they were so close to each other. In a crevice saucer made of elder ruins, she emerged from a sound sleep. The Phixias had been tracking her that day, when they made the realization that she was on the clipside of the pinkeye fountain.\n\nMorning drew alarm on tracking devices pricking up there ears. They seemed to be going through withdrawl systems, weakling criteria careering through mephoscalpic ceremony. As she finished her ritual of morning magic passes, her joints broke the barrier of sound blurting her whereabouts, pussing the ears of the phixias. Only a few could withstand the noise. Because it paralyzed them yawning before the day could began. Her ancestry embarked on confrontation while the Phixias could do nothing but watch and freeze at first sight of her. As she arose from slumber, her necks twisted round for a better view. Caught off guard by their presence as well, she began filtering passages from the irradi exerptas, line by line as all phixias became her slave tantamount to medusa perveing, lids unlocked, \"behold your fate\" she sang. Phixias....once proud and merciless, regressed slobbering coitus interrupts, blue balled at their core. Movement was not an option as she slung death from her poach, pendulum brushing frantic strolls....the phixias began to disrobe their useless armor of alligator skin. The use of their weapons seemed to work in her favor, cutlery weilded by themselves exacting a blood clot potion that had them drinking from their palms. The eyes were rendered useless as they were the first to go. Held in their pencors some impaled the pupils with great delight, some opened pockets in their bellies for the morning of their sight. In their minds, chasing dragon fumes of opium fields coughing up a bliss so pure that death seemed not so imminent. Frolicking and holding each other they became objectified auditory hallucinations, \u201cTry the throat it legwarms well the comatose of spinal cells....wish yourself the will to crawl...remove your feet for they have no use.\u201d These instructasketches seduced them well...forever in her grasp, in her dream like spell. The triumph of herself willed the killing of themselves, as she painted out the beauty for all of them to see. As statues fall at the weather of time their corpse\u2019s resembled a civilization long frail and lost. As she dripped upwards into murdersome air, all Phixias had drawn their last sips of blood on Recherches sand. Slowly it all became disowned. When all the commotion had died down, she lowered herself down on the sand to make sure that everyone was dead. Little did she know that one of the Phixias, Marxanalia, had left her talk back pore open so that the others at the Quarac could find her and the others. When Clavietika came upon Marxanalia she realized that Recherche had been watching.listening. Before she knew it she was surrounded by a phalanx of Phixias, armed with headphonetic protective gear that also shielded their eyes from the ghost effect that she perpetrated at them. A blue whaled siren shot through the desert, mushroom clouding nails of sonic temper on them. Phixias squirmed in disbelief, she was the one entity that made them know fear. As her brute force exploded, some of the Phixias protective gear fell victim to disintegration, enabling them to take their own life as she floated spitting suicide at their beastial costumes. Paranormaly activated all around her, harpooned by some Phixias who remained untouched by her, they tried to strattle her down to mute position....yet their efforts seemed childish and unredeeming. The power of her voice strung the Phixias round a lasso like force that killed them on impact with the sand. Only but one of the brave Phixias managed to force himself inside her...because that was the trick. In order to take her down, you had to go right through her projected physique. This one did penetrate her transparent case, planting a Quarac immobilization muzzle in her very center. He fortunately did not make it as it was impossible to withstand the radioactivity that made up the dna of her design. Once the others saw that the implant had been installed, they activated it with out any hesitation. As they clicked the on button of their archaic contraption, Clavietika choked on an embalming fluid of arsenic powder crippling her astral projected body, revealing the inside compartment of cockpit seating where they found none other than Ojeno Valaso. she did have her weakness, because she was the Mother Hechicera.\n\nOjeno was hauled to the prison camp, dragging his body into the cheers and delight of all the other Phixias. The prisoners all bowed in his honour, for he was the epitome of their struggle...and now it seemed as though it was all over. They were proud of him for standing up to the war monger Recherche. He was the real criminal. Their hope now sank eternal, lost, at least not with out a fight... as was much of their lives like his. Recherche stood imposing as a figure of excess power, in the marble cut foot stool of his podium balcony. He grinned the \u201cI told you so,\u201d reassurance of an eight year old child having gotten his way. This was a sad day for all Sowvietna. The cancer had lumped a greater strength in multiples of three.\u201cI stand before you victorious\u201d.The prisoners spat on the ground, cursing his name. \u201cBefore you I bring the body of Ojeno Valaso the Clavietika Tresojos\u201d, the Phixias rallied behind their gluttonous leader, in a roar of approval.\u201cWe will rid our land of the perverse instability, starting with him.\u201d \u201cRe- education begins now!\u201d bellowed his guttural flatulence. \u201cWhat is the whole of the law?\u201d He screamed, hypnotic and spastically. \u201cLos Tres Ojos\u201d...they beamed back at him.\u201cRagman,\u201d they continued,\u201cand dead doll stares\u201d reached the frenzy to its all time low. \u201cOjeno will volunteer his mistakes as an impaliour...........we will slide his body down to ash.....at dawn brings the promise of a new tommorow.\u201d\n\nAs dawn drew its first early squints, the magnetic fortress of Ojeno Valaso\u2019s body itched adorned, bein crudo from the poison induced in his body. He knew today was his last day. No game plan really...it was all over. The radioactive costume that waged suicide on the Phixia populous was all but destroyed. He knew that if he could get to it that he could gestate a new epidemic in hearts of the Quarac.The Clavietika was left in the desert to be inhabited by crackpot dust. It was useless, he was doomed for all to see. The tecla illuminosa rang gently in the distant mildeu of his holding tank. Four notes that served as impending death calling from the sharpness of the totem poles that waited for his body outside. The scenario relished by Recherche danced around the cranial sanctuty of Ojeno\u2019s thoughts. The Phixias marched into the cell, and unlocked the shackles round his wrists. They paraded him outside in front of the other prisoners. A crown of leaches was placed around his head, sucking dry the nutritious intelligence that sweated blood from his drooping head, laying waste to the knowledge he had accumulated from years of projecting suicide on the weak minded phixias. This was his day in the sun, burning crisp of bodily function. None of the magic passes he learnt from the ancestry of his Clavietikas could save him now. The guards placed him, standing over a hole in the ground that held the pointed poles that would soon erect itself from the floor. Crowds gathered round to catch a final glimpse of their fallen leader. Slowly the totem poles began their rise into the blistering scorch of there sun. The tip of the poles teased his body sliding past his legs, rearing its point slowly climbing past his thighs until Ojeno felt the vicinity of his lower region being probed.\n\nThe sun threw a tarp over Ojeno\u2019s body suffocating heat in a slouching death kiss. Ojeno began hallucinating himself at the foot of a bridge about to jump off while strange mechanical beasts scurried along under him. His dream sequence found him hovering over a lifeless body held together by technicalities of machine,surrounded by scuffling mourners. The pain penetrated him to an exhaustion that stung the spinal tail of deep breathing calluses.....he screamed into the rays of light that illuminated his body. The pole cut through him, sauldering pieces of digestion, making it\u2019s way past his lungs.. cutting off circulation, unbreading his throat, shooting right through the entrance of his mouth. Ojeno moaned welting, forming a bruise on two legs, unable to go anywhere. Death did not set in right away, drawing with it a lengthy demise. The phixias roared indefinitely for hours, pelting him with rocks that bit his head thumping it broken ways. A purple shade of black grew all over him, shivering from heat. With his own hands, Recherche began cranking the lever that connected a series ropes to a gigantic circular glass as it rose over Ojeno creating a dome overhead. Phixias overjoyed from miles around. \u201cWhat of your maggot prince now ?\u201d scolded one Phixia to an old woman sitting on her knees filled with anger. The dome glass magnified a beam of light onto Ojeno\u2019s heat soaked body. The light eradicated his form into ash upon first touch. The Phixias lunged under him celebrating their victory by painting themselves in the ashes. It was all over. Heat sunk in intuition.\n\nThe beam of light obscured his perception, as a projection, he emerged again, but this time he was not a re-generation, he was Cerpin Taxt again. A harmonic force lifted his body from the Sowvietna desert, and slowly he could see how small they really were the farther he got away. The farther he got away, the more it dawned on him that he was but a germ in the perspiration of a speaker, ordering people to drink. Dripped in sweat into a vat of of kool aid, as it was being stirred by the hand of the speaker. His podium soapbox, seemed tank like, governing all in his scowl. His scowl was undistiguishable as it was hidden behind dark shaded sunglasses. The tint masked his omnipotence, masking the enigma that was completely under his control. \u201cPastor jones will now speak,\u201d rang the voice from the speaker of the p.a.\"Please get some medication..Simple, it\u2019s simple, we must die with dignity.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost my way\u201d - Tecla Illuminosa\n\ncicatriz esp;\nDo you recall its name ? As it suggested beck and call, this face and heel. Will drag your halo through the mud, ash of pompei.\n\nErupting in a statues dust, shrouded in veils, because these handcuffs hurt too much. Still scalping this ticketless applause. And when they drag the lake there\u2019s nothing left at all. Sutured, contusion..beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague. I\u2019ve lost my way. Even if this cul de sac would pay. To reach inside a vault, whatever be the cost. Sterling clear blackened ice, and when they drag the lake there\u2019s nothing left at all. I\u2019ve defected........I\u2019ve defected.....I\u2019ve defected. This is my last incision...the stitches have defected. Beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague. I\u2019ve lost my way, even if this cul de sac did pay....beyond the anthills of..I\u2019ve lost my way. Even if you reach inside a vault, whatever be the cost. Sterling clear blackened ice. And when they drag they lake there\u2019s nothing left at all. I\u2019ve defected..... I\u2019ve defected......\n{Ectopicshapeshif ting-Penancepropulsion}\n\nSpiked coals cushioned broken feet. I felt breathing become irrelevant...again. Bronze-plated inquisitions marred my nightmare...they were closing in on me. There was a television crew filming the speech that I had spilled from. They focused steadily on Pastor Jones\u2019 tinted stamina. Their inspection could mean a shit less to him, for it was he who focused on them and their air-polluted tumbling of the ankles...chattering the planks in front of them. Focusing vaselined hazes crusted around the shoulders, clinically shooting anatomical views of the event. Fallen from a forehead, I festered in the fruit of the punch, entitled to split by apples in throats, waiting to be drunk. This vibrant teaching was as ancient as time itself. I knew they all had to die regardless of age, pigment, shape or size. Swallow it.Law...it won\u2019t hurt a bit. I knew that I believed. The pastor made sure that no one would get out alive. I am exhumed as quenching bullets, left stringing court pestilence from a tiny violin. Cameras put three and three together and tried for the exit wounds to no avail. By the time the sermon had settled a pasting of run-on sentences, I had found my way. Seizing the prey, I unfolded masses of full-tilted graves. Cat-scanned plateau, fanatically, news at eleven, we had deformed the gates of heaven.\n\nWhile cyanide remarks burdened the peeking corpses all to a stump, this here poison sat pleasantly debating sheep-counting hordes. Layers of bones hid me from recognition. No lepers could find me here. I found solace chambers, locking a much-needed captivity. Unprovoked, yet unconstrained. I found everything always too good to be true. It stank...river-soaked mildew fumes, just enough to pass out from. Embalmed by floods through my ice-parked zip code, they found me again, just when I was pulling the plug. Televators gave their last crawl whistle, boiled to awaken my sloth from warm fuzz. OnceagainIwouldbeextractedintotheE.S.P.impure.Inaneedlediris,huffedmygasolineandlitit\naflame, dropped back to Sowvietna....never ending that never-mind place.\n\nTusks fell hand-shaped, macerated on the Sowvietnen sand. What was left of the Clavietika\ncostume, now collected bleached whale sepulchers, curled fetal tomb, under grazes radiating from sun to skin. Scintillating spare dignities from its trunk, fizzling clock unwound with gibberish coats, assaulted from an ass-kicking, left sulking to death. Eyelids sank lazy shroud coins. Thanatopsis, sweat the croak, activated no more. Silent perdition flagged white cascade, hoisted and blown to particular smithereens. The insectivores had had their say....enter the vultures. The ground bickered up and down with the jostling of gigantic footsteps. From mercurial distances came something towards the Clavietika\u2019s spent body. Gargling squirms removed the clean air, as a girth of snorts splurged closer and closer. Horns sounded, made of leftover animal parts, playing the prayer of vicissitudes, tumbling earth under a stampede parade of scavengers on the make. They stomped on the littering of black rose petals that shot from a head-wrap of turban exhaust pipes. The hot sand was far too peasant-like for their convoy. From afar, their features spilled bulbous, plump,and muffled. Their loin-cloths barely drew curtains over their genitalia-stubble. Flatulence broke open thick, pollinating overweight and marsupial...feeding off the undesirable slabs of leftover rations. Their bellies shuddered, wakening sand of whatever life it didn\u2019t have. Between roman candle cliffs, swindled from stalking grounds where aluminum cans spooked the mountain sides of flesh impediments on stilted giraffe-necklace legs...devouring napalm showers on everything made game, uncorking wine puddles in the core of the dunes. Combing the desert, they dropped jaws at the sight of the almost aqua-clear Clavietika as she enamored their attention span. She blinked feline in flashlit streams, another bleep on the radar screen. To the colossus, she shined from a shoulder of jewelry, coveted by thieves, on a carpet coarse and brillo- padded, not just another diamond in the gruff. By this time the vultures, owl pierce in sight, swooped in for a closer look. Beauty caught the beast; these instances are of the greatest monsters in the world. They had never seen a more painfully beautiful sight. Even as she was unfilled, slouched over, out of order, left to rot, the giants found a place for her in the stillbirth of their hearts. They nudged at her corpse, dirt under fingernail shields from oversized hands. They smelled of decayed animals, cloths dampened by journey through foreign land. She was not a meal by any means, enigma to their puzzle. Imbroglio unfolded, worshipped by these clumsy oxen.\n\n\u201cPlace her in your anecdote pouch.....remove it of the other carcasses,\u201d molted one of the giants, lava spilling from his mouth. Slitted on his belly was storage, designed for food, but at this time it was to be transformed into a nursing home. He keeled over towards her, picking her up by both of her heads. As he removed her from the slump, she stretched out into a toffee shape, drooping lifeless expressions on her melting face. She blew in pieces, no longer dripping upwards at the sky. The giants, careful not to drop her, fell ill with silence. Never had they feasted on such an alien sight. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d cried one of the giants. Aghast with nervousness, the giants trembled in gears. \u201cShe is the seed,\u201d remarked another. \u201cWe must bring her to Adastra.... he will know what to do with her.\u201d All at once they agreed. Gang mentalityoverpoweredbytheherd.Theybeganchantingleper-psalmsintotheE.S.P.impure.Inorder to transport themselves to their place of origin they had to chant their mantra-link. \u201cCuantas vidas me vas a pagar...de estos bosques susiou de sangre del aere muerto cicatriz... quando llegara a la ciudad donde tropize...salte veneno en las montanias donde nasi....\u201d And with them, she left the desert glands,bathed by the sweat, thunderous from the throat of conviction. The mantra worked, dematerializing them back to their home.\n\nHome for them was found headless by doorsteps, peeled of skin on hind legs in Nedra Queret. Lost citadel....child hooded to sacrifice on a pyramid of offerings, gathering to eviscerate handfuls of mortals. To ward off the onslaught of he who is only known as Moatilliatta. Afraid of the chalk in which he might use to outline the city, in a wrath-nest in which it was kept. This was the home of the giants. El Querrencia de Topiltzin...safe-haven to various Proteans who brought themselves as unknowing luck buried with charm...to sprout in an equinox garden shielding all villagers from the last of the great. Every weekend brought the promise of a new litany. On this battered lecture came the names of children, read by El Mago Adastra. He being the spirit-economist elect, brought superstition as a cloak and venereal epidemics as a power source of repression. On his cerebral vortex banged the tarry stool image that banked bodies for a master, servants inlaid, and concave to the bending of his fingers. Who dared to call him out, topical in his plague? Shanked the living shit out of the patrons made of saints. Into the ear he dosed the conscience of Koral Mataxia...under his thumb; a tightened mob selected all the clouds. \u201cBe it the law...Moatilliatta is merciful to all for the price of few...never a day will come...where he might let slip the flares of tongues.\u201d Monitoring all sanctivity, Koral had held them captive for an eternity. If it was your child, you were meant to feel proud...because if you thought about it loosely, Koral would only cover their mouths. Pillowed to a smother, was his promise-clinic. Check in the relatives for a blood-free reign. What most people in this hardened community didn\u2019t know was that much blood would be needed to keep the creature at bay. Where was this animal? Had they ever really thought about it ever really existing? The particulars of this creature held high question marks in the back of their minds...but only in the backs of their minds, mind you. They were so caught up in the delirium of the lore, they forgot to check the ventriloquist hiding underneath the floors. Some might even say that the polar opposite to Topiltzin is found in the Eriatarka House of Facial and MuscularCorrections. Good old Doctor Tarant had implanted the exoskeleton well. Now all that was left was the flint to strike match.Koral must have known the cleansing was coming... they say he gonna be here...lo vas a ver...\n\nKoral Mataxia issued many a warning to his people. When he said jump, they asked how high. Wrapped around a finger of wands, he and the witch-doctor Adastra kept a tidy ship of fools in line. Curfew medications were issued at high noon, making the inhabitants drowsy and inaudible. If you didn\u2019t take the medicine...it...would surely get to you. This kept them from ever seeing the hungry footsteps, creeping the neighboring grounds. It...was said to come under the belly of sound and light to feed on the plague of hissing children... because if they couldn\u2019t see it, then they would surely be under his spell. He snatched kids: candy from a baby, as easy as it ever could be. This city clothed flinches, because these handcuffs hurt too much. As he made his way to his garden, on a routine basis, Koral longed, lonely to the haul...wishing delusions of grandeur, wet his appetite on the shoulders of the young...\u201cmust I feed myself to this live force alive?\u201d Nevertheless it was this longing that drove him to split-personality fences... unable to dig under or jump over them, which doctor is it that would be calling on this go- around? Jekyll or the Hyde? His putrid body flapped along the ground in dire need of a staple diet prison, gorging himself to a fat pig mitten, kissing babies was his M.O., but it only made families hide their young...for even they might find little mojo on the menu that night. \u201cKoral doesn\u2019t make mistakes,\u201d he burped in tube sock meat shavings. The roll of flesh that had accumulated on his pork-ridged tummy steamed against the tobacco stench of his porta-potty hygiene. His fingers greased off sausage trains with the stains of nicotine gravy plummeting to the floor. The smell would infest the village to no end. Koral\u2019s wit was something to contend with as well. Sharper than razor unjagged on the tongue...to convince you of your wrong-doing was the soul of his pig heart. If ever there was an abundance of socio- pathetic rambling it was he who gassed it out loud. Dinner time was everything in the journals that he violently carved. Koral\u2019s true intentions shined like a new sex offender moving in next door. Lock your kiddies in the basement, if you had the fight left in you. Between Adastra\u2019s witch-doctoring and Koral\u2019s gluttonous appetite, the city of Toplitzin was in for a crumbling of blood-stroked extortions. \u201cUnder the statues, I will implant the stolen body parts... this will grant me a garden of relief,\u201d Koral said as he licked his lips clean of infant scalps. \u201cYou see, what they don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt them. So long as I have your advice by my side, we can split the wickers burning by the moon of light,\u201d he went on, and Adastra seemed to agree. It was his place to agree, if he wanted to keep his place by the bully\u2019s side. What he fed to him were wives tales of a centipeded kind. Many legs, they came a-crawling as double-speak serpentine. At every three pentagropes sailed a life in the lifted frontal hatch of Koral\u2019s prized clavietika statuettes. They curved in cathartic contortions, gargoyle to the Niles. Calf-golden genuflections engrossing a prince among the living dead. \u201cTo you...reeking thumbnails to my hibernating insomnia... a ti te parto por la pinchi madre...under blue plastic bags...incubates the He Zero-Rouge...keep yourself from the venison appendix of these infants without feet...for they have nowhere but your mouth to crawl in.\u201d However he could get it,all played well in Toplitzin. With its population calmly defaulting under control, Koral was unaware of the summons that had gathered as a pet to his salavace retrieval. The giants would bring back to him fertilizer to his unhatched egg... screaming and kicking out the floodlights, throat throttle end to the rain.\n\nZxiat and Ghiest were mended of the Gemini mirror. You could spot them in double-take mime, wondering. These children knew the hum louder and softer than any of the others while it pied-piped their night-sight. In the mourning of their allotment is where you could hear them smile. Two receptors picking up the messages in the outfields, zoning in on the atonements at hand. They knew when the mayday distressed others, but no one would ever believe a child. They scurried along the Pyramines of Toplitzin, not a care on their mind. Sometimes they would even play in Koral\u2019s garden with the dramagon statues. A prayer to them meant the gift of life, or so their parents had winked. They hushed them nightly with boogie man legends that drew the curtains on their afternoon sight. Would they ever see the black of night? This was their handicap, living in hexile. On this occasion, while rummaging through the grass blades of Koral\u2019s garden, the twins were being watched by a third party. She stared at their presence with wonder: how could they not know what they were playing with? Compass point studious behavior to her eye, the slobber from her viewpoint couldn\u2019t drool any faster. Neuralgia, who had seen it all before, was immersed in the children\u2019s activities...how they talked to the dramagon statues with effortless interplay, how they stared into its\u2019 eyes... even how they only ever spoke to the one on the left; it meant something to them. It meant something to her. It only lured her for curiosity\u2019s sake. When the twins would stop playing, she would rush over immediately to the one statue on the left, and with falsetto paper cuts she would hum out the hymn. It became a source of meditation for her, all while Koral would spy on her trance mesh lace. Between her and the twins they had managed to contact the spirit of a distant relative who had been deceased for ice-age lengths. It channeled its thoughts through them in a divination nod. They seemed to naturally bring it onto themselves, and even more so this intrigued Koral Mataxia, peeping from a vanishing state. She was under the spell of this relative. It wanted to know where it was, and why was it there....and why was there so much suffering? Neuralgia could not bare all the truths, because the children might discover their own fate. On the day that she revealed the nature of the beast, she became ripe for the picking. She knew no other real love than that of the one she had developed to this stranger. So for Koral to strike when he did...it only deafend matters worse for Toplitien. (What have you brought from your salavace finds?)\n\nJust three days prior to a reading of the new litany, Koral was sent word that his herd of giant malnourishments was to be bringing something of great value to the Citadel, something not found in the eight-ball pond of the Toplitzin Pyramines. Something septic parted its hair this way. Koral couldn\u2019t even be bothered by such uneventful news, because of his earwhig obsession that festered in the grime of seated teeth. He was too busy trying to corrupt Neuralgia into a \u2018yes\u2019 mode of submission. She was unbreakable. She could give a fuck less who and or what he was about. It was just a shelter to her. She could always find someone better to take care of her. She feared him not. She merely wanted to spar with his feelings...who was really being had? As she waited for his appearance to be made, she felt the distant asking of a fact-check on what she had just said to the dramagon statuette. She wanted out, to converse with her subconscious, but Koral\u2019s sleeping quarters were heavily guarded. Every door was locked, she had no escape route . . . until finally a hypnotic surrender blew itself well beyond a dozing portion. Their nightly mating routine did ever please her. After his impotent try failed to subdue her, he left to attend the welcome of the salavace, enabling Neuralgia to escape to the gardens. On her way past some of the rooms she heard a pocket of hissing, flirting from a closed door. She whisked for a dropping of eaves, glass to ear to door. \u201cWhat have you brought for me to see?\u201d he fisted through his lockjaw. \u201cWhat is all this end all-be all rhetoric?\u201d he asked impatiently. The giants of his salavace recon-squadron stepped back as they pushed forward on one of the giants. \u201cHectros, unflesh your forage womb, and show Koral what we have found.\u201d Hectros quivered in the hacksaw point of his cerebreal pattern. To begin, he had to hold his breath while his fingers sliced for the find from within his bowels, c-sectioned, quite the apparition. If bricks could only sprout wings....\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Koral demanded. Hectros fumbled, and said \u201cshe is the seed that you have been looking for, master.\u201d Koral replied, \u201cNo, my son, the precious creature I have been bedding now holds the seed.\u201d The Clavietika shot straight up....spines in a row....spine as an arrow.\n\nBoth her mouths shot rays of light as everything around them shot out of focus. Everyone had disappeared as the two heads became one. Its face began shoving seizures from a ray in its mouth. Crisis personality autopsy...ticks a time from a peeling back of nails and skin. The spins swung the room to a stop, and suddenly Cerpin Taxt woke up. For a brief moment in time, he caught a glimpse from above the circuits spilling haywire. He was in a hospital. All his friends stood around him calling him back, pleading for a second coming. To the dismay of Cerpin\u2019s drowning body, ice shocked in the freezing heat, he snapped back in the drip of the IV, back to Koral Mataxia. \u201cDid you see that,\u201d winced Adastra, ears to the ground, dimensions croaking the technique. \u201cPonte ojo,\u201d laughed the witch doctor. \u201cI want you to incinerate it...whatever it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes Koral, then give me the ashes, to place in the sackcloth.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\n\nThe giants wept a thunder that scattered across the skies. Was this all she was good for? \u201cHer\nremains are the seed,\u201d scolded Adastra. \u201cShe will be of better use as the black of an ash\u201d they dragged her to the repitissue room, for the deed. As they locked the doors behind her, and set the oven controls to a melting rot, the Clavietika began hissing air, boiling like a pot of hot water. This only disturbed the ogres more. They couldn\u2019t bear to stand by as their baby was cleaned to ash. Adastra walked into the repitissue room to collect the final ingredients. When he was done, he made his way towards the garden of the dramagons. \u201csla`via-ce`est-eviria\u201d he shouted at the statuettes, and within seconds the statue on the left rose on a hinge, revealing a grave pit of some sort. Adastra then proceeded to dump all of the Clavietika\u2019s ashes into the earth-colored safe. A potion had been set as a booby-trap offering. On the following morning, Zxiat and Ghiest would encounter a more developed contact point of reference.\n\nWith Zxiat and Gheist only reaching three years in age each, they had always managed to steer clear of the litany. Call it luck...but they were taught very well by their parents on when not to be seen or heard. For the twins the medication was never administered, as it was with all children. Koral seemed to like the effect it had on the kids. When he entered their homes he wanted them to have it ingrained in their sponge-like impression, the memory of Koral collecting them while their parents slept. Their tiny little bodies collected more flavor if it was coerced with adrenalin...always working as a kill switch. The twins made their way towards the Dramagon Garden, to pay their relative a visit. They began seeing him in the form of a grandfather. They were taught about the ways Koral stole the others while their parents retreated obediently. They were taught that they were the hunted, and that they hadn\u2019t very much longer to live. He consoled them, parental as one unit. The statuette spoke to them ever so gently. It told them how good they had been...and how proud he was of them. The twins smiled peaking in the red. They would do anything for him. He asked that before they left, could they lift the hatch at the bottom of his feet? He asked with the promise of a reward in mind...as it would rain on them as gifts in the dead of night. Zxiat never bothered to ask if it had a name. It was Gheist who uttered the tag, certificate dangling off the toe to its identity. \"Moattilliatta...he is Moattilliatta...he promised me something\u2019s gonna shower drown the pallbearer plants\"...Zxiat wondered if this person would clean the slate. Maybe he could make them all wake up. Neuralgia, in the meantime, had long been brainwashed into forgetting her daily visitations. She couldn\u2019t even remember when the last time it was that she had prayed to the dramagon. Off the wagon in a fucking spree servitude, she too forgot significance, and pushed it out of her way, just the way Koral had planned it all along. Koral instead began appearing at the garden, speaking to the dramagon on the left. It spoke with him at great lengths about a little blueprint he had been kind of toying with. It was really quite simple. They would debate for hours throwing vein branch telepathy at each other\u2019s cranial entanglements. He presented Moattilliatta with a map of the air space that surrounded many feet above them. Whispers traded strong holds with cackles, as their brows arched, pinched to no good.\n\nThe litany had been read to soured snores of the Toplitzin City. It was only fair that he did it this way. Too many pigeons in the oven. This is just how it was. On this reading fell the droplets of Zxiat\u2019s and Gheist\u2019s names. It was a day that the twins feared would come. Moatilliatta knew nothing of this as he was under Koral\u2019s spell. That day marked the contractions at three minutes apart. Cracking yolk unsnapped the storm, Tremula Metacarpi was filtering its scorn. On a wooden horse table, chipped by previous bloodlust, Adastra set the utencils for sharper unravelings. These two will bring me closer to him. Zxiat and Gheist felt distant from their physical costumes. That uniform wasn\u2019t really gonna matter anymore. Where they were going would bring them closer to Moattilliatta too. They marched up to the horses made of wood, and placed their bodies in full sacrificial pose. There in their eyes was a lifeless staircase to the wake-mode they wanted to inherit. From the billfold of his backside Koral reached in, handle touching palm. He slowly read the inscripture of brailed chapters : \"I\u2019ll reign blood on this city\" read his fingers on the machete handle that was about to decapitate the twins. Neuralgia felt no emotion in the care she abandoned. She was preoccupying herself with chores that Koral ordered her to do. She sat there folding lumps of fleshbatter for the nightly meal. Through grinders she devoured the mush into a fertilizer machine, making a batch of play dough nutrients for Koral to eat. Every time she laid into the blob, rolling pin in hand, Koral would slice the pacifier softness of the children\u2019s\u2019 faces. Blood lept onto his face as goggles. The smell of copper musk knocked the shit out of everything. Koral\u2019s frenzy smiled out a laughing fit, while the soaked parts of the children retired by his lap. The carnage dressed his possession couture quite nicely. Neuralgia slaved away into the evening, keeping her end of the bargain. After Koral reached climax, he unclothed his porkframe from the robes that were common place in his Ceouniratta burial rites. They always required a burning, so that everything would just blow away forgetting what had just occurred. His caravan eyes breached full dress for a stabbing growth from an unaccidental foothold-talon, pecking fabrication. Moattilliatta could now commence his pulling heads up out of the intra-exhaust. Territories targeted. Handpicked the noose from the camp of the riots. Adastra saw it coming, before becoming Koral Mataxia, the alternate personality that dueled only with himself.\n\nBy the right dramagon, soil had imploded, dirt beneath the statuette laid in pieces on the ground corrosion. Smoke trailed toward the skies, swirling, ingested to oversize pills. Something had hatched an insult, deflowering in the hips of clouded mud...hunting for Koral of one thousand or more. Moattilliatta adorned the pillow lips that floated through his sides. He was slicing right by the wind, breaking sound and tasting light. Such a magnificient specimen. Tremula had constructed a finely tuned weapon, with one taste on his mind. Let it spell holes in the grip. He reached a wing span that covered three arenas full of fetus stock. Completely made of raw cartilage and marrow pole switchblades, he wore the epidermis wings of Zxiat\u2019s and Gheist\u2019s skinned torsos. He had no flesh masquerade to hide his anonymity, just the exoskeleton made by scribble-infected tremulants, courtesy of Wolfram Tarant. That day marked the twisting of the new Hex Zero-Rouge...he\u2019d hibernate no more. From cell to cell, building after building he toppled the pyramines, exposing fire hydrant fires of pale neck wine. Neuralgia tried to repent yet Moattilliatta could not forgive her. With one of his legs he held her body down while carving out her trachea with his left claw. Her scream became muted on the instant that it happened. Her body kept moving. She sat up and walked in a circle skipping to the scratches on the record before her aftershock collapsed. Her front row seat served its punishment in the eyes of Moattilliatta. Koral would feel the impact in his old factory nap, as his scent slept right through most of it. When he finally caught scent of the bodies he rushed over to his window for a better look. Moattilliatta had piled up the cadavers of all of Toplitzin\u2019s population in front of Koral\u2019s home...in the midst of high noon. Koral could see no one in front of his home except for the pile of people. Moattilliatta perched itself on the roof of his house waiting for just the right second...Koral felt the knocking of his breath behind him and he froze. Moattilliatta arched back his enormous head and opened his perforated jaws. The blood of all the people fell from his guilty mouth. Adastra could see Bird, as he lived on as the eyes on the back of Koral\u2019s head...and with one jolt downwards Moattilliatta clipped the duet in half, leaving two pieces squirming and trying to hide. As Moattilliatta served himself for another his entire body began to regenerate into a bubbling stretch of molecules. He pulsated light reflection, dawning the birth back into home...he clobbered at the nothing air, like a roach trapped on its back...he mutated with shapes of elbows and legs kicking and contorting on the inside of his body. He came to, submerging from a full-bodied river that lead him to the footsteps of a bridge. At the other end of it was a row of steps that immersed itself into another body of water. He walked slow, poking the romrseing silence. As he walked across the bridge all he could think was about getting over only so that he could come back and finish his business. At the other end he held his breath and walked down into the water below him, for now it was Cerpin Taxt\u2019s turn to go home. Around the hospital Cerpin\u2019s friends caught their breath and lashed out a sigh of relief; he had finally made it through. Ectoplasm spit from his nose, ears and mouth....he smiled for miles around. He knew what it all meant. To the friends who lined up to greet him, the worst was over. He spent the next three days getting oriented, with simple speech patterns and physical therapy. It would be a while before things got back to normal. Shotgunned to reality, waiting to go back.\n\nthis apparatus must be unearthed;\nI\u2019ve been waiting for so long, for someone to mend all the blame.

Anonymous... avenge my name.\n{through an oubliette he awakes}\n\nCerpin began spending the next couple of years of his life packing up and saying his goodbyes. All the times he had told his friends that he was leaving, they never picked up on the slang fast enough, or maybe some of them dismissed it the way you ignore a beggar. He managed to slip through their fingers every time, looking everyone in the eye when informing them of this. All of his attempts shrugged an apathy from his shoulders. His luck had run its course in the run-on sentence of his life. He knew the images well. He didn\u2019t need a reminder. He knew he did not belong. The cord grew shorter and shorter by the years, until he was paid a visit by the ink he dispersed into sculpting holds. Tremula Metacarpi was inches away from victory. Through the curtains of his room came a gliding entrance....a mist of vermin dandruff settled on him deleting all the pretext. He tossed and turned on that abbreviated night. The tremulants sent word to him that he had not finished the job well enough. They felt immensely disappointed by his half-assed tries. They wanted more from him. \u201cIt seems you\u2019ve gotten away scot-free, Cerpin,\u201d aroused the voices of his visions. \u201cDid you really think you could get away that easily? Do you take us for imbeciles in your rapid eye movement? Was it ectopic for you? Shift all sort of pretty shapes, did we... propel yourself far and long?\u201d Cerpin clutched his eyes closed in a tenant-versus- landlord debate : \u201cYou... you\u2019re the one who left us here....what will we do without you. If you think you\u2019ve passed all the tests, then come collect what is rightfully yours.\u201d All the banter roared at Cerpin without so much as a face to put behind it, assaulted by the collective chatter of drawn false teeth. \u201cI know... I know,\u201d Cerpin whimpered. \u201cAll of this time... bedsore containment... how am I to know that the music has faded?\u201d \u201cThat is for you to come and figure out now isn\u2019t it?\u201d grinned the whiny solution, Metacarpi, at every turn. \u201cYou have but one more chance...\u201d Cerpin had pissed himself by the bucket-load. \u201cWhat is it... anything, I\u2019ll do anything!\u201d he cried. His arms crippled a contortion of subliminal surrender. He would do anything now just to please his children. He knew what awaited him, and it suited him fine. This world had become grey and monotonous. The world as he knew it wasted away miserably with no interest for his kind. Why beat them when you could join them? In the realm of Tremula Metacarpi, a throne was just itching for an occupant. An appointed location, just beneath a bridge in Rezjua, by a network of commuters, would appear an entrance to the e.s.p.-impure. They gave him a date for the new portal. Would he accept? Could he commit? Was it in his blood? Did he have to get rid of it... the body. The sickness badgered him endlessly, pulling at his soul. The tremulants made martyrs out of his sentence attempts. The Lepers of Unhydriat were nowhere to be found alive. Tremulants had ceased them with brief bouts of Muzzles and asthma. Dominoes couldn\u2019t have hit it any harder on the nail. Cerpin Taxt had given up in order to be with his beloved. They had it in for each other, crossing the picket line, smearing blood all over the tracks, all over the concrete, all over his face. \u201cYa me voy.\u201d\n\nCerpin Taxt stood high above the wobbling miscarriage of oncoming traffic. The rail that adorned the top of the bridge pulsed a cape of winced-shut onlooking. He had managed to get this far, without hesitation. He didn\u2019t stretch his arms in some lame Christ pose. He had more class than that. Standing perfectly still, he disassembled his flag, blew his nose into it and shoved it back in his front left pocket. He wore a pair of black slip-on winos. His jeans, stained by a sweating reaction to his mission, fell in normal rotation around his waist. They were black. His skin parted to a smear of candle wax abandonment. Cerpin\u2019s head became interchangeable... sometimes monk-shaven, other times a long black shoe-polish shine. The nostrils on his grill flared ape-ways. His lips had a cleft wound that had been tapered by a lacerating tailor. What room was there for such a creature? In his mind he thought it would be a good idea if he burned all of his ID bracelets and cards, so that when they blew away they would end up in the landfill on the other side of town. Surely Neuralgia would find them there in a projected state of astral wondering. No money in his pockets, no letter of reckoning. All the plans had accumulated in a warp round of loose-change thinking. He had wished to teach more to his friends about the meaning of it all...yet with all three of his eyes constantly blinking...who could ever tell if he could see at all... his body hadn\u2019t really expected much less, but this one paved the way for a last meal. He began walking it like a tightrope. From the coma came a limp strut not too familiar to his body before the accident. His arms carved to a rat-poisoned shrivel, parked themselves neatly to his sides. In the distance came the grunting of a vehicle semi-seismic in its size. The driver slowly brought his truck to a halt. Cerpin just stared marble-eyed, holding on to nothing. The driver looked up at him, hoping he wouldn\u2019t do it. Nothing could rewrite the previous pages, quietly standing there. Within seconds Cerpin would make up his mind.\n\nA light breeze simmered around the balance of his stance. Each closing second opened up a dilation to the blinking that only he could see. Everyone froze, collapsing, lungs full of sighs. An application had been turned in while others turned away. Like the hands of a clock seeping forward his body began to slide into a centrifugal force. He knew the routine... no panic had its way, just a calm throbbing on the door knob. He had made a skeleton key made of cobwebs and hair, and from up on the roof of his mouth did he pull it out, hair-balled to the gag. Swiftly moving now, as his body gained momentum, he held the pick-lock with a vengeance, fists pointing at a sea of mayday handling. He promised to come fighting with a silence most deafening... no loose muscles, no more dents... a torpedo gaining on them... Tremula had not the faintest idea what was in store for them. Faster he sank towards the medium exit of the concrete. He bared no thoughts in mind. He had erased himself from the directory with amnesia as an asthmatic anesthetic, while the portal craved a gaping penetration coughing right before his remorse struck gold. Within one gulp Cerpin Taxt had hit the ground. The cracking of the marrow. The boils roaring up on the shores. One side of his face had collapsed inwards, while the rest of his body remained intact. His limbs slightly mumbled an escape act... and the puppet strings fell behind the ragman of Mundy, tangled and defaced. People turned away in disgust. The driver of the truck that had stopped to watch him came over to his side. He whispered in his ears, \"Dios mio que esistes?\" to no response. Cerpin\u2019s right eye was left open, not a murmur, now without blinks. All that was left was a uniform, which he had no use for keeping. His essence unglued itself from the asphalt, leaving behind a syrup of red, for his body was the feast, served on beds of ancestral curses. Now, that feared chalk outline would close in circumference only around the temple of his ruins. On the underpass in downtown Rezjua, Cerpin left a tale, as it forever stained the ground he hit on that jealous cold leach afternoon. No one knew what hit them. The accusations flew from angles far and deprived. Who was to blame for the death of Cerpin Taxt? Had he really jumped to his death, while our backs were bathing just east of the river Enial.\n\nOn the day of his funeral, a march of convicted devotees brought the ashes of Cerpin\u2019s body to a pauper\u2019s grave. The ghetto Tramontaine that they scaled lead to the outhouse of dumpster waste. There were no street signs, just the mud of unpaved roads. In the distance surveyed the watchful eyes of some keystone border patrol. He had always warned of not littering away foolishly because it would end up here. Funny how unwanted trash accumulates away from the safety of urban decay... on the other side of the river nestled just behind the graves, separated a reality subpoena asking who would choose sides? Cerpin had chosen his path. Was it everybody else who had already died? Against a sandpapered kiss, bidding for the farewell bet, was lost the soul of Cerpin Taxt.\n\ntelevators;\nJust as he hit the ground, they lowered a tow that stuck in his neck to the gills. fragments of sobriquets... riddle me this... three half eaten corneas, who hit the aureole... stalk the ground... stalk the ground. You should have seen the curse that flew right by you. Page of concrete, stained walks crutch in hobbled sway. Autodafe... a capillary hint of red... Only this manupod crescent in shape has escaped. The house half the way..fell empty with teeth that split both his lips, mark these words. One day this chalk outline will circle this city. Was he robbed of the asphalt that cushioned his face? A room colored charlatan hid in a safe... stalk the ground... stalk the ground. You should have seen the curse that flew right by you. Page of concrete, stain walks crutch in hobbled sway. Autodafe... a capillary hint of red. Only this manupod crescent in shape has escaped. Pull the pins... save your grace... mark these words on his grave.\n\nPull the pins...save your grace...mark these words on his grave. You should have seen the curse that flew right by you.

You let the shutters make sackcloth and ashes out of a blind mans picaresque heart. You take the veil... you\u2019ll take the dive..you take the veil. It\u2019s not over till the tremulant sings. These ideas of march are they so make believe? How tempts the revenant... slice up and not across. You take the veil... you\u2019ll take the dive... you take the veil. A mass of gallon sloth, as flies have walls for feet. A rapturous verbatim, someone said but who is to know. And when you find the fringe, the one last hit that spent you, you\u2019ll find the ossuary spilling by the day. Iconoclastic had it coming for years, they know the prisons that you have yet to fear...where thumbs hide inside of sleeping bag mouths, ad-lib your memories by casting a drought.

ice\n[Betty]\nMy mother will start to worry\n[Ray]\nBeautiful, what's you're hurry\n[Betty]\nAnd father will be pacing the floor\n\n[Ray]\nListen to that fireplace roar\n[Betty]\nSo really I'd better scurry\n[Ray]\nBeautiful, please don't hurry\n[Betty]\nWell, maybe just a half a drink more\n\n[Ray]\nWhy don't you put some records on while I pour\n[Betty]\nAnd the neighbors might think\n\n[Ray]\nBetty it's bad out there\n[Betty]\nSay, what's in this drink?\n[Ray]\nNo cab's to be had out there\n\n[Betty]\nI wish I knew how\n\n[Ray]\nYour eyes are like starlight now\nYou might

say that I tried\n\n[Ray]\nWhat's the sense of hurting my pride?\n\n[Betty]\nI really can't stay\n\nRay]\nBaby don't hold out\n\n[Betty]\nAh, but it's cold outside\n\n[Verse 2]\n[Betty]\nI simply must go\n\n[Ray]\nBetty, it's cold outside\n\n[Betty]\nThe answer is no\n\n[Ray]\nI say, it's cold out there\n\n[Betty]\nThe welcome has been\n\n[Ray]\nHow lucky that you dropped in\n\n[Betty]\nSo nice and warm\n\n[Ray]\nLook out that window, man that's hard\n\n[Betty]\nMy sister will be suspicious\n\n[Ray]\nGosh, your lips look delicious\n\n[Betty]\nMy brother will be there at the door\n\n[Ray]\nWaves upon a tropical shore\n\n[Betty]\nMy maiden aunt's mind is vicious\n\n[Ray]\nGosh, your lips are delicious\n\n[Betty]\nWell maybe just a cigarette more\n\n[Ray]\nOh, never such a blizzard before\n\n[Betty]\nI've got to go home\n\n[Ray]\nBetty, you'll freeze out there\n\n[Betty]\nSay, lend me your coat\n\n[Ray]\nIt's up to your knees out there\n\n[Betty]\nYou've really been grand\n\n[Ray]\nI thrill when you touch my hand\n\n[Betty]\nBut don't you see\n\n[Ray]\nHow can you do this thing to me\n\n[Betty]\nThere's bound to be talk tomorrow\n\n[Ray]\nThink of my lifelong sorrow\n\n[Betty]\nAt least there will be plenty implied\n\n[Ray]\nIf you caught pneumonia and died\n\n[Betty]\nI really can't stay\n\n[Ray]\nGet over that old lie\n\n[Betty & Ray]\nAh, but it's cold

is not worth living\nWithout the master's hand\n\nOh, in God we trust\nIn God we trust\nWe're lost just like this penny\nUnless in God we trust\n\nAnd then, I heard a still small voice

Does a livelier iris, winter weather notwithstanding, shine upon the burnished Bunter? Have you got that sort of conquering feeling? The Don Juan touch, so to speak?\"\n\nBunter, balancing the breakfast tray on his fingers, coughed deprecatingly.\n\n\"You have a good, upstanding, impressive figure, if I may say so,\" pursued Wimsey, \"a bold and roving eye when off duty, a ready tongu\u0435, Bunter\u2014and, I am persuaded, you hav\u0435 a way with you. What more should any cook or house-parlourmaid want?\"\n\"I am always happy,\" replied Bunter, \"to exert myself to the best of my capacity in your lordship's service.\"\n\n\"I am aware of it,\" admitted his lordship. \"Again and again I say to myself, Wimsey, this cannot last. One of these days this worthy man will cast off the yoke of servitude and settle down in a pub. or something, but nothing happens. Still, morning by morning, my coffee is brought, my bath is prepared, my razor laid out, my ties and socks sorted and my bacon and eggs brought to me in a lordly dish. No matter. This time I demand a more perilous devotion\u2014perilous for us both, my Bunter, for if you were to be carried away, a helpless martyr to matrimony, who then would bring my coffee, prepare my bath, lay out my razor and perform all those other sacrificial rites? And yet\u2014\"\n\n\"Who is the party, my lord?\"\n\n\"There are two of them, Bunter, two ladies lived in a bower, Binnorie, O Binnorie! The parlourmaid you have seen. Her name is Hannah Westlock. A woman in her thirties, I fancy, and not ill-favored. The other, the cook\u2014I cannot lisp the tender syllables of her name, for I do not know it, but doubtless it is Gertrude, Cecily, Magdalen, Margaret, Rosalys or some other sweet symphonious sound\u2014a fine woman, Bunter, on the mature side, perhaps, but none the worse for that.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, my lord. If I may say so, the woman of ripe years and queenly figure is frequently more susceptible to delicate attentions than the giddy and thoughtless young beauty.\"\n\n\"True. Let us suppose, Bunter, that you were to be the bearer of a courteous missive to one Mr. Norman Urquhart of Woburn Square. Could you, in the short space of time at your disposal, insinuate yourself, snake-like, as it were, into the bosom of the household?\"\n\n\"If you desire it, my lord, I will endeavour to insinuate myself to your lordship's satisfaction.\"\n\n\"Noble fellow. In case of an action for breach, or any consequence of that description, the charges will, of course, be borne by the management.\"\n\n\"I am obliged to your lordship. When would your lordship wish me to commence?\"\n\n\"As soon as I have written a note to Mr. Urquhart. I will ring.\"\n\n\"Very good, my lord.\"\n\nWimsey moved over to the writing-desk. After a few moments he looked up, a little peevishly.\n\n\"Bunter, I have a sensation of being hovered over. I do not like it. It is unusual and it unnerves me. I implore you not to hover. Is the proposition distasteful, or do you want me to get a new hat? What is troubling your conscience?\"\n\"I beg your lordship's pardon. It had occurred to my mind to ask your lordship, with every respect\u2014\"\n\n\"Oh, God, Bunter\u2014don't break it gently. I can't bear it. Stab and end the creature\u2014to the heft! What is it?\"\n\n\"I wished to ask you, my lord, whether your lordship thought of making any changes in your establishment?\"\n\nWimsey laid down his pen and stared at the man.\n\n\"Changes, Bunter? When I have just so eloquently expressed to you my undying attachment to the loved routine of coffee, bath, razor, socks, eggs and bacon and the old, familiar faces? You're not giving me warning, are you?\"\n\n\"No, indeed, my lord. I should be very sorry to leave your lordship's service. But I had thought it possible that, if your lordship was about to contract new ties\u2014\"\n\n\"I knew it was something in the haberdashery line! By all means, Bunter, if you think it necessary. Had you any particular pattern in mind?'\n\n\"Your lordship misunderstands me. I referred to domestic ties, my lord. Sometimes, when a gentleman reorganizes his household on a matrimonial basis, the lady may prefer to have a voice in the selection of the gentleman's personal attendant, in which case\u2014\"\n\n\"Bunter!\" said Wimsey, considerably startled, \"may I ask where you have contracted these ideas?\"\n\n\"I ventured to draw an inference, my lord.\"\n\n\"This comes of training people to be detectives. Have I been nourishing a sleuth-hound on my own hearth-stone? May I ask if you have gone so far as to give a name to the lady?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\"Well?\" said Wimsey, in a rather subdued tone, \"what about it, Bunter?\"\n\n\"A very agreeable lady, if I may say so, my lord.\"\n\n\"It strikes you that way, does it? The circumstances are unusual, of course.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord. I might perhaps make so bold as to call them romantic.\"\n\n\"You may make so bold as to call them damnable, Bunter.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" said Bunter, in a tone of sympathy.\n\n\"You won't desert the ship, Bunter?\"\n\n\"Not on any account, my lord.\"\n\n\"Then don't come frightening me again. My nerves are not what they were. Here is the note. Take it round and do your best.\"\n\n\"Very good, my lord.\"\n\n\"Oh, and, Bunter.\"\n\n\"My lord?\"\n\n\"It seems that I am being obvious. I have no wish to be anything of the kind. If you see me being obvious, will you drop me a hint?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my lord.\"\n\nBunter faded gently out, and Wimsey stepped anxiously to the mirror.\n\n\"I can't see anything,\" he said to himself. \"No lily on my cheek with anguish moist and fever-dew. I suppose, though, it's hopeless to try and deceive Bunter. Never mind. Business must come first. I've stopped one, two, three, four earths. What next? How about this fellow Vaughan?\"\n\nWhen Wimsey had any researches to do in Bohemia, it was his custom to enlist the help of Miss Marjorie Phelps. She made figurines in porcelain for a living, and was therefore usually to be found either in her studio or in some one else's studio. A telephone-call at 10 a.m. would probably catch her scrambling eggs over her own gas-stove. It was true that there had been passages, about the time of the Bellona Club affair,[1] between her and Lord Peter which made it a little embarrassing and unkind to bring her in on the subject of Harriet Vane, but with so little time in which to pick and choose his tools, Wimsey was past worrying about gentlemanly scruples. He put the call through and was relieved to hear an answering \"Hullo!\"\n\n[1]See \"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club,\" published 1928.\n\n\"Hullo, Marjorie! This is Peter Wimsey. How goes it?\"\n\n\"Oh, fine, thanks. Glad to hear your melodious voice again. What can I do for the Lord High Investigator?\"\n\n\"Do you know one Vaughan, who is mixed up in the Philip Boyes murder mystery?\"\n\n\"Oh, Peter! Are you on to that? How gorgeous! Which side are you taking?\"\n\n\"For the defence.\"\n\n\"Hurray!\"\n\n\"Why this pomp of jubilee?\"\n\n\"Well, it's much more exciting and difficult, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it is. Do you know Miss Vane, by the way?\"\n\n\"Yes and no. I've seen her with the Boyes-Vaughan crowd.\"\n\n\"Like her?\"\n\n\"So-so.\"\n\n\"Like him? Boyes, I mean?\"\n\n\"Never stirred a heart-beat.\"\n\n\"I said, did you like him?\"\n\n\"One didn't. One either fell for him or not. He wasn't the merry bright-eyed pal of the period, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh! What's Vaughan?\"\n\n\"Hanger-on.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"House-dog. Nothing must interfere with the expansion of my friend the genius. That sort.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"Don't keep saying 'Oh!' Do you want to meet the man Vaughan?\"\n\n\"If it's not too much trouble.\"\n\n\"Well, turn up tonight with a taxi and we'll go the rounds. We're certain to drop across him somewhere. Also the rival gang, if you want them\u2014Harriet Vane's supporters.\"\n\n\"Those girls who gave evidence?\"\n\n\"Yes. You'll like Eiluned Price, I think. She scorns everything in trousers, but she's a good friend at a pinch.\"\n\n\"I'll come, Marjorie. Will you dine with me?\"\n\n\"Peter, I'd adore to, but I don't think I will. I've got an awful lot to do.\"\n\n\"Right-ho! I'll roll round about nine, then.\"\n\nAccordingly, at 9 o'clock, Wimsey found himself in a taxi with Marjorie Phelps, headed for a round of the studios.\n\n\"I've been doing some intensive telephoning,\" said Marjorie, \"and I think we shall find him at the Kropotkys'. They are pro-Boyes, Bolshevik and musical, and their drinks are bad, but their Russian tea is safe. Does the taxi wait?\"\n\n\"Yes; it sounds as if we might want to beat a retreat.\"\n\n\"Well, it's nice to be rich. It's down the court here, on the right, over the Petrovitchs' stable. Better let me grope first.\"\n\nThey stumbled up a narrow and encumbered stair, at the top of which a fine confused noise of a piano, strings and the clashing of kitchen utensils announced that some sort of entertainment was in progress.\n\nMarjorie hammered loudly on a door, and, without waiting for an answer, flung it open. Wimsey, entering on her heels, was struck in the face, as by an open hand, by a thick muffling wave of heat, sound, smoke and the smell of frying.\n\nIt was a very small room, dimly lit by a single electric bulb, smothered in a lantern of painted glass, and it was packed to suffocation with people, whose silk legs, bare arms and pallid faces loomed at him like glow-worms out of the obscurity. Coiling wreaths of tobacco-smoke swam slowly to and fro in the midst. In one corner an anthracite stove, glowing red and mephitical, vied with a roaring gas-oven in another corner to raise the atmosphere to roasting-pitch. On the stove stood a vast and steaming kettle; on a side-table stood a vast and steaming samovar; over the gas, a dim figure stood turning sausages in a pan with a fork, while an assistant attended to something in the oven, which Wimsey, whose nose was selective, identified among the other fragrant elements in this compound atmosphere, and identified rightly, as kippers. At the piano, which stood just inside the door, a young man with bushy red hair was playing something of a Czecho-Slovakian flavour, to a violin obligato by an extremely loose-jointed person of indeterminate sex in a Fair-Isle jumper. Nobody looked round at their entrance. Marjorie picked her way over the scattered limbs on the floor and, selecting a lean young woman in red, bawled into her ear. The young woman nodded and beckoned to Wimsey. He negotiated a passage and was introduced to the lean woman by the simple formula: \"Here's Peter\u2014this is Nina Kropotky.\"\n\n\"So pleased,\" shouted Madame Kropotky through the clamour. \"Sit by me. Vanya will get you something to drink. It is beautiful, yes? That is Stanislas\u2014such a genius his new work on the Piccadilly Tube Station\u2014great, n'est-ce-pas? Five days he was continually travelling upon the escalator to absorb the tone-values.\"\n\n\"Colossal!\" yelled Wimsey.\n\n\"So\u2014you think? Ah! You can appreciate! You understand it is really for the big orchestra. On the piano it is nothing. It needs the brass, the effects, the timpani-b'rrrrrrr! So! But one seizes the form, the outline! Ah! it finishes! Superb! Magnificent!\"\n\nThe enormous clatter ceased. The pianist mopped his face and glared haggardly round. The violinist put down its instrument and stood up, revealing itself, by its legs, to be female. The room exploded into conversation. Madame Kropotky leapt over her seated guests and embraced the perspiring Stanislas on both cheeks. The frying-pan was lifted from the stove in a fusillade of spitting fat, a shriek went up for 'Vanya' and presently a cadaverous face was pushed down to Wimsey's, and a deep guttural voice barked at him: \"What will you drink?\" while simultaneously a plate of kippers came hovering perilously over his shoulder.\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Wimsey, \"I have just dined\u2014just dined,\" he roared despairingly, \"full up, complet!\"\n\nMarjorie came to the rescue with a shriller voice and more determined refusal.\n\n\"Take those dreadful things away, Vanya. They make me sick. Give us some tea, tea, tea!\"\n\n\"Tea!\" echoed the cadaverous man, \"they want tea! What do you think of Stanislas' tone-poem? Strong, modern, eh? The soul of rebellion in the crowd\u2014the clash, the revolt at the heart of the machinery. It gives the bourgeois something to think of, oh, yes!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said a voice in Wimsey's ear, as the cadaverous man turned away, \"it is nothing. Bourgeois music. Programme music. Pretty!\u2014You should hear Vrilovitch's 'Ecstasy on the letter Z.' That is pure vibration with no antiquated pattern in it. Stanislas\u2014he thinks much of himself, but it is old as the hills\u2014you can sense the resolution at the back of all his discords. Mere harmony in camouflage. Nothing in it. But he takes them all in because he has red hair and reveals his bony structure.\"\n\nThe speaker certainly did not err along these lines, for he was as bald and round as a billiard-ball. Wimsey replied soothingly:\n\n\"Well, what can you do with the wretched and antiquated instruments of our orchestra? A diatonic scale, bah! Thirteen miserable, bourgeois semi-tones, pooh! To express the infinite complexity of modern emotion, you need a scale of thirty-two notes to the octave.\"\n\n\"But why cling to the octave?\" said the fat man. \"Till you can cast away the octave and its sentimental associations, you walk in fetters of convention.\"\n\n\"That's the spirit!\" said Wimsey. \"I would dispense with all definite notes. After all, the cat does not need them for his midnight melodies, powerful and expressive as they are. The love-hunger of the stallion takes no account of octave or interval in giving forth the cry of passion. It is only man, trammelled by a stultifying convention\u2014Oh, hullo, Marjorie, sorry\u2014what is it?\"\n\n\"Come and talk to Ryland Vaughan,\" said Marjorie. \"I have told him you are a tremendous admirer of Philip Boyes' books. Have you read them?\"\n\n\"Some of them. But I think I'm getting light-headed.\"\n\n\"You'll feel worse in an hour or so. So you'd better come now.\" She steered him to a remote spot near the gas-oven, where an extremely elongated man was sitting curled up on a floor cushion, eating caviare out of a jar with a pickle-fork. He greeted Wimsey with a sort of lugubrious enthusiasm.\n\n\"Hell of a place,\" he said, \"hell of a business altogether. This stove's too hot. Have a drink. What the devil else can one do? I come here, because Philip used to come here. Habit, you know. I hate it, but there's nowhere else to go.\"\n\n\"You knew him very well, of course,\" said Wimsey, seating himself in a waste-paper basket, and wishing he was wearing a bathing-suit.\n\n\"I was his only real friend,\" said Ryland Vaughan, mournfully. \"All the rest only cared to pick his brains. Apes! parrots! all the bloody lot of them.\"\n\n\"I've read his books and thought them very fine,\" said Wimsey, with some sincerity. \"But he seemed to me an unhappy soul.\"\n\n\"Nobody understood him,\" said Vaughan. \"They called him difficult\u2014who wouldn't be difficult with so much to fight against? They sucked the blood out of him, and his damned thieves of publishers took every blasted coin they could lay their hands on. And then that bitch of a woman poisoned him. My God, what a life!\"\n\n\"Yes, but what made her do it\u2014if she did do it?\"\n\n\"Oh, she did it all right. Sheer, beastly spite and jealousy, that's all there was to it. Just because she couldn't write anything but tripe herself. Harriet Vane's got the bug all these damned women have got\u2014fancy they can do things. They hate a man and they hate his work. You'd think it would have been enough for her to help and look after a genius like Phil, wouldn't you? Why, damn it, he used to ask her advice about his work, her advice, good lord!\"\n\n\"Did he take it?\"\n\n\"Take it? She wouldn't give it. Told him she never gave opinions on other authors' work. Other authors! The impudence of it! Of course she was out of things among us all, but why couldn't she realise the difference between her mind and his? Of course it was hopeless from the start for Philip to get entangled with that kind of woman. Genius must be served, not argued with. I warned him at the time, but he was infatuated. And then, to want to marry her\u2014\"\n\n\"Why did he?\" asked Wimsey.\n\n\"Remains of parsonical upbringing, I suppose. It was really pitiful. Besides, I think that fellow Urquhart did a lot of mischief. Sleek family lawyer\u2014d'you know him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"He got hold of him\u2014put up to it by the family, I imagine. I saw the influence creeping over Phil long before the real trouble began. Perhaps it's a good thing he's dead. It would have been ghastly to watch him turn conventional and settle down.\"\n\n\"When did this cousin start getting hold of him, then?\"\n\n\"Oh\u2014about two years ago\u2014a little more, perhaps. Asked him to dinner and that sort of thing. The minute I saw him I knew he was out to ruin Philip, body and soul. What he wanted\u2014what Phil wanted, I mean\u2014was freedom and room to turn about in, but what with the woman and the cousin and the father in the background\u2014oh, well! It's no use crying about it now. His work is left, and that's the best part of him. He's left me that to look after, at least. Harriet Vane didn't get her finger in that pie, after all.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it's absolutely safe in your hands,\" said Wimsey.\n\n\"But when one thinks what there might have been,\" said Vaughan, turning his blood-shot eyes miserably on Lord Peter, \"it's enough to make one cut one's throat, isn't it?\"\n\nWimsey expressed agreement.\n\n\"By the way,\" he said, \"you were with him all that last day, till he went to his cousin's. You don't think he had anything on him in the way of\u2014poison or anything? I don't want to seem unkind\u2014but he was unhappy\u2014it would be rotten to think that he\u2014\"\n\n\"No,\" said Vaughan, \"no. That I'll swear he never did. He would have told me\u2014he trusted me in those last days. I shared all his thoughts. He was miserably hurt by that damned woman, but he wouldn't have gone without telling me or saying good-bye. And besides\u2014he wouldn't have chosen that way. Why should he? I could have given him\u2014\"\n\nHe checked himself, and glanced at Wimsey, but, seeing nothing in his face beyond sympathetic attention, went on:\n\n\"I remember talking to him about drugs. Hyoscine\u2014veronal\u2014all that sort of thing. He said, 'If ever I want to go out, Ryland, you'll show me the way.' And I would have\u2014if he'd really wanted it. But arsenic! Philip, who loved beauty so much\u2014do you think he would have chosen arsenic?\u2014the suburban poisoner's outfit? That's absolutely impossible.\"\n\n\"It's not an agreeable sort of thing to take, certainly,\" said Wimsey.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Vaughan, hoarsely and impressively\u2014he had been putting a constant succession of brandies on top of the caviare, and was beginning to lose his reserve\u2014\"Look here! See this!\" He pulled a small bottle from his breast-pocket. \"That's waiting, till I've finished editing Phil's books. It's a comfort to have it there to look at, you know. Peaceful. Go out through the ivory gate\u2014that's classical\u2014they brought me up on the classics. These people would laugh at a fellow, but you needn't tell them I said it\u2014funny, the way it sticks\u2014'tendebantque manus ripae ulterioris amore, ulterioris amore'\u2014what's that bit about the souls thronging thick as leaves in Vallombrosa\u2014no, that's Milton\u2014'amorioris ultore\u2014ultoriore\u2014damn it\u2014poor Phil!\"\n\nHere Mr. Vaughan burst into tears and patted the little bottle.\n\nWimsey, whose head and ears were thumping as though he were sitting in an engine-room, got up softly and withdrew. Somebody had begun a Hungarian song and the stove was white-hot. He made signals of distress to Marjorie, who was sitting in a corner with a group of men. One of them appeared to be reading his own poems with his mouth nearly in her ear, and another was sketching something on the back of an envelope, to the accompaniment of yelps of merriment from the rest. The noise they made disconcerted the singer, who stopped in the middle of a bar, and cried angrily:\n\n\"Ach! this noise! these interruptions! they are intolerable! I lose myself! Stop! I begin all over again, from the beginning.\"\n\nMarjorie sprang up, apologising.\n\n\"I'm a brute\u2014I'm not keeping your menagerie in order, Nina\u2014we're being perfect nuisances. Forgive me, Marya, I'm in a bad temper. I'd better pick up Peter and toddle away. Come and sing to me another day, darling, when I'm feeling better and there is more room for my feelings to expand. Good-night, Nina\u2014we've enjoyed it frightfully and, Boris, that poem's the best thing you've done, only I couldn't hear it properly. Peter, tell them what a rotten mood I'm in tonight and take me home.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Wimsey, \"nervy, you know\u2014bad effect on the manners and so on.\"\n\n\"Manners,\" said a bearded gentleman suddenly and loudly, \"are for the bourgeois.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Wimsey. \"Beastly bad form, and gives you repressions in the what-not. Come on, Marjorie, or we shall all be getting polite.\"\n\n\"I begin again,\" said the singer, \"from the beginning.\"\n\n\"Whew!\" said Wimsey, on the staircase.\n\n\"Yes, I know. I think I'm a perfect martyr to put up with it. Anyway, you've seen Vaughan. Nice dopey specimen, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I don't think he murdered Philip Boyes, do you? I had to see him to make sure. Where do we go next?\"\n\n\"We'll try Joey Trimbles'. That's the stronghold of the opposition show.\"\n\nJoey Trimbles occupied a studio over a mews. Here there was the same crowd, the same smoke, more kippers, still more drinks and still more heat and conversation. In addition there was a blaze of electric light, a gramophone, five dogs and a strong smell of oil-paints. Sylvia Marriott was expected. Wimsey found himself involved in a discussion of free love, D. H. Lawrence, the prurience of prudery and the immoral significance of long skirts. In time, however, he was rescued by the arrival of a masculine-looking middle-aged woman with a sinister smile and a pack of cards, who proceeded to tell everybody's fortune. The company gathered around her, and at the same time a girl came in and announced that Sylvia had sprained her ankle and couldn't come. Everybody said warmly, \"Oh, how sickening, poor dear!\" and forgot the subject immediately.\n\n\"We'll scoot off,\" said Marjorie. \"Never mind about saying good-bye. Nobody marks you. It's good luck about Sylvia, because she'll be at home and can't escape us, I sometimes wish they'd all sprain their ankles. And yet, you know, nearly all those people are doing very good work. Even the Kropotky crowd. I used to enjoy this kind of thing myself, once.\"\n\n\"We're getting old, you and I,\" said Wimsey. \"Sorry, that's rude. But do you know, I'm getting on for forty, Marjorie.\"\n\n\"You wear well. But you are looking a bit fagged tonight, Peter dear. What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all but middle-age.\"\n\n\"You'll be settling down if you're not careful.\"\n\n\"Oh, I've been settled for years.\"\n\n\"With Bunter and the books. I envy you sometimes, Peter.\"\n\nWimsey said nothing. Marjorie looked at him almost in alarm, and tucked her arm in his.\n\n\"Peter\u2014do please be happy. I mean, you've always been the comfortable sort of person that nothing could touch. Don't alter, will you?\"\n\nThat was the second time Wimsey had been asked not to alter himself; the first time, the request had exalted him; this time, it terrified him. As the taxi lurched along the rainy Embankment, he felt for the first time the dull and angry helplessness which is the first warning stroke of the triumph of mutability. Like the poisoned Athulf in the Fool's Tragedy, he could have cried, \"Oh, I am changing, changing, fearfully changing.\" Whether his present enterprise failed or succeeded, things would never be the same again. It was not that his heart would be broken by a disastrous love\u2014he had outlived the luxurious agonies of youthful blood, and in this very freedom from illusion he recognised the loss of something. From now on, every hour of light-heartedness would be, not a prerogative but an achievement\u2014one more axe or case-bottle or fowling-piece, rescued, Crusoe-fashion, from a sinking ship.\n\nFor the first time, too, he doubted his own power to carry through what he had undertaken. His personal feelings had been involved before this in his investigations, but they had never before clouded his mind. He was fumbling\u2014grasping uncertainly here and there at fugitive and mocking possibilities. He asked questions at random, doubtful of his object, and the shortness of the time, which would once have stimulated, now frightened and confused him.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Marjorie,\" he said, rousing himself, \"I'm afraid I'm being damned dull. Oxygen-starvation, probably. D'you mind if we have the window down a bit? That's better. Give me good food and a little air to breathe and I will caper, goat-like, to a dishonourable old age. People will point me out, as I creep, bald and yellow and supported by discreet corsetry, into the night-clubs of my great-grandchildren, and they'll say, 'Look, darling! that's the wicked Lord Peter, celebrated for never having spoken a reasonable word for the last ninety-six years. He was the only aristocrat who escaped the guillotine in the revolution of 1960. We keep him as a pet for the children.' And I shall wag my head and display my up-to-date dentures and say, 'Ah, ha! They don't have the fun we used to have in my young days, the poor, well-regulated creatures!'\"\n\n\"There won't be any night-clubs then for you to creep into, if they're as disciplined as all that.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes\u2014nature will have her revenge. They will slink away from the Government Communal Games to play solitaire in catacombs over a bowl of unsterilised skim-milk. Is this the place?\"\n\n\"Yes; I hope there's someone to let us in at the bottom, if Sylvia's bust her leg. Yes\u2014I hear footsteps. Oh, it's you, Eiluned; how's Sylvia?\"\n\n\"Pretty all right, only swelled up\u2014the ankle, that is. Coming up?\"\n\n\"Is she visible?\"\n\n\"Yes, perfectly respectable.\"\n\n\"Good; because I'm bringing Lord Peter Wimsey up, too.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the girl. \"How do you do? You detect things, don't you? Have you come for the body or anything?\"\n\n\"Lord Peter's looking into Harriet Vane's business for her.\"\n\n\"Is he? That's good. Glad somebody's doing something about it.\" She was a short, stout girl with a pugnacious nose and a twinkle. \"What do you say it was? I say he did it himself. He was the self-pitying sort, you know. Hullo, Syl\u2014here's Marjorie, with a bloke who's going to get Harriet out of jug.\"\n\n\"Produce him instantly!\" was the reply from within. The door opened upon a small bed-sitting room, furnished with the severest simplicity, and inhabited by a pale, spectacled young woman in a Morris chair, her bandaged foot stretched out upon a packing-case.\n\n\"I can't get up, because, as Jenny Wren said, my back's bad and my leg's queer. Who's the champion, Marjorie?\"\n\nWimsey was introduced, and Eiluned Price immediately inquired, rather truculently:\n\n\"Can he drink coffee, Marjorie? Or does he require masculine refreshment?\"\n\n\"He's perfectly godly, righteous and sober, and drinks anything but cocoa and fizzy lemonade.\"\n\n\"Oh! I only asked because some of your male belongings need stimulating, and we haven't got the wherewithal, and the pub's just closing.\"\n\nShe stumped over to a cupboard, and Sylvia said:\n\n\"Don't mind Eiluned; she likes to treat 'em rough. Tell me, Lord Peter, have you found any clues or anything?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Wimsey. \"I've put a few ferrets down a few holes, I hope something may come up the other end.\"\n\n\"Have you seen the cousin yet\u2014the Urquhart creature?\"\n\n\"Got an appointment with him for tomorrow. Why?\"\n\n\"Sylvia's theory is that he did it,\" said Eiluned.\n\n\"That's interesting. Why?\"\n\n\"Female intuition,\" said Eiluned, bluntly. \"She doesn't like the way he does his hair.\"\n\n\"I only said he was too sleek to be true,\" protested Sylvia. \"And who else could it have been? I'm sure it wasn't Ryland Vaughan; he's an obnoxious ass, but he is genuinely heart-broken about it all.\"\n\nEiluned sniffed scornfully, and departed to fill a kettle at a tap on the landing.\n\n\"And whatever Eiluned thinks, I can't believe Phil Boyes did it himself.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Wimsey.\n\n\"He talked such a lot,\" said Sylvia. \"And he really had too high an opinion of himself. I don't think he would have wilfully deprived the world of the privilege of reading his books.\"\n\n\"He would,\" said Eiluned. \"He'd do it out of spite, to make the grown-ups sorry. No, thanks,\" as Wimsey advanced to carry the kettle, \"I'm quite capable of carrying six pints of water.\"\n\n\"Crushed again!\" said Wimsey.\n\n\"Eiluned disapproves of conventional courtesies between the sexes,\" said Marjorie.\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Wimsey, amiably. \"I will adopt an attitude of passive decoration. Have you any idea, Miss Marriott, why this over-sleek solicitor should wish to make away with his cousin?\"\n\n\"Not the faintest. I merely proceed on the old Sherlock Holmes basis, that when you have eliminated the impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be true.\"\n\n\"Dupin said that before Sherlock. I grant the conclusion, but in this case I question the premises. No sugar, thank you.\"\n\n\"I thought all men liked to make their coffee into syrup.\"\n\n\"Yes, but then I am very unusual. Haven't you noticed it?\"\n\n\"I haven't had much time to observe you, but I'll count the coffee as a point in your favour.\"\n\n\"Thanks frightfully. I say\u2014can you people tell me just what was Miss Vane's reaction to the murder?\"\n\n\"Well\u2014\" Sylvia considered a moment. \"When he died\u2014she was upset, of course\u2014\"\n\n\"She was startled,\" said Miss Price, \"but it's my opinion she was thankful to be rid of him. And no wonder. Selfish beast! He'd made use of her and nagged her to death for a year and insulted her at the end. And he was one of your greedy sort that wouldn't let go. She was glad, Sylvia\u2014what's the good of denying it?\"\n\n\"Yes, perhaps. It was a relief to know he was finished with. But she didn't know then that he'd been murdered.\"\n\n\"No. The murder spoilt it a bit\u2014if it was a murder, which I don't believe. Philip Boyes was always determined to be a victim, and it was very irritating of him to succeed in the end. I believe that's what he did it for.\"\n\n\"People do do that kind of thing,\" said Wimsey, thoughtfully. \"But it's difficult to prove. I mean, a jury is much more inclined to believe in some tangible sort of reason, like money. But I can't find any money in this case.\"\n\nEiluned laughed.\n\n\"No, there never was much money, except what Harriet made. The ridiculous public didn't appreciate Phil Boyes. He couldn't forgive her that, you know.\"\n\n\"Didn't it come in useful?\"\n\n\"Of course, but he resented it all the same. She ought to have been ministering to his work, not making money for them both with her own independent trash. But that's men all over.\"\n\n\"You haven't much opinion of us, what?\"\n\n\"I've known too many borrowers,\" said Eiluned Price, \"and too many that wanted their hands held. All the same, the women are just as bad, or they wouldn't put up with it. Thank Heaven, I've never borrowed and never lent\u2014except to women, and they pay back.\"\n\n\"People who work hard usually do pay back, I fancy,\" said Wimsey, \"\u2014except geniuses.\"\n\n\"Women geniuses don't get coddled,\" said Miss Price, grimly, \"so they learn not to expect it.\"\n\n\"We're getting rather off the subject, aren't we?\" said Marjorie.\n\n\"No,\" replied Wimsey, \"I'm getting a certain amount of light on the central figures in the problem\u2014what journalists like to call the protagonists.\" His mouth gave a wry little twist. \"One gets a lot of illumination in that fierce light that beats upon a scaffold.\"\n\n\"Don't say that,\" pleaded Sylvia.\n\nA telephone rang somewhere outside, and Eiluned Price went out to answer it.\n\n\"Eiluned's anti-man,\" said Sylvia, \"but she's a very reliable person.\"\n\nWimsey nodded.\n\n\"But she's wrong about Phil\u2014she couldn't stick him, naturally, and she's apt to think\u2014\"\n\n\"It's for you, Lord Peter,\" said Eiluned, returning. \"Fly at once\u2014all is known. You're wanted by Scotland Yard.\"\n\nWimsey hastened out.\n\n\"That you, Peter? I've been scouring London for you. We've found the pub.\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"Fact. And we're on the track of a packet of white powder.\"\n\n\"Good God!\"\n\n\"Can you run down first thing tomorrow? We may have it for you.\"\n\n\"I will skip like a ram and hop like a high hill. We'll beat you yet, Mr. Bleeding Chief-Inspector Parker.\"\n\n\"I hope you will,\" said Parker, amiably, and rang off.\n\nWimsey pranced back into the room.\n\n\"Miss Price's price has gone to odds on,\" he announced. \"It's suicide, fifty to one and no takers. I am going to grin like a dog and run about the city.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I can't join you,\" said Sylvia Marriott, \"but I'm glad if I'm wrong.\"\n\n\"I'm glad I'm right,\" said Eiluned Price, stolidly.\n\n\"And you are right and I am right and everything is quite all right,\" said Wimsey.\n\nMarjorie Phelps looked at him and said nothing. She suddenly felt as though something inside her had been put through a wringer.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/856053", "artist_names": "Charles Brown",

image?\nA person or a persona, real thing or a gimmick?\nI hate when rappers get on the mic and act timid\nThey must have never came in contact with a menace\nIn the lab with the \u2018Chemist, loading up ammunition\nIn my path for the listeners, fans, and the critics\nNiggas out getting it, trying to advance to a million\nAnd trying to their fam in positions\nWhere they ain\u2019t gotta rap, shoot hoops or pitch grams for a living\n10 G\u2019s to a hundred grand, keep it consistent\nThe exact definition of a man on a mission\nTo take over the land, expand demolition\nWonder how many syllables I can cram in this sentence?\nLike a general I command your attention\nI be killing \u2018em, every stanza is venom\nIn my B-boy stance, can\u2019t help but glance at a nigga\n[Verse 2: The Alchemist]\nSo in the summer I\u2019m getting dumber\nDoing my digits, doing my numbers\nRappers are similar, six are 1, half-a-dozen are the other\nI\u2019m custom cut control, rock a windsuit and some Timberlands\nTouch the floor and guard my space, \u2018til they carve my face\nIn the side of a mountain like Rushmore\nI\u2019m prophetic, doctor the drums with a medic\nCould end up like I\u2019m fresher than lettuce and get shredded\nI\u2019m ready, yo, I\u2019ll stand next to the sprinkler without getting wetted\nDon\u2019t step in my circle, no doubt, get deaded\nServe \u2018em no cut like video footage without the edit\nEmperor, thinking, \u201cWhat the fuck I need a pencil for?\u201d\nWhen I could scrape the corners without a Desert?\u201d\nI\u2019m a criminal into vandalism\nWhoever want attention, stomp \u2018em out and whoever\u2019s standing with \u2018em\n\n[Verse 3: Roc C]\nI\u2019m the line-deliverer, used to be sinister\nSix shots in the Glock, pop at your Senator\nTend to be nice, put a price on my own life\nThen I thought about: better off killing myself\nI\u2019m the, rhyme-ratcher, gun packer\nI\u2019ll bitch smack a nigga up then laugh after\nCold cash or back to dirty braids, back to crime pays\nBack on my parkay, buddy or entr\u00e9e\nI\u2019m the Bombay, general strikes\nJohn Fort\u00e9, moonwalk in on the court date, the boy\u2019s late\nPuff puff pass to another date\nClock stopped tickin\u2019 now, guess that\u2019s my fate\nHold weight, fornicator skate out the front door\nBeen smoking so long, I know I\u2019ll never overdose\nStill petrol, me, I\u2019m not\nTie \u2018em up, leave a note at your spot, like we need that\nYou might also like[Verse 4: Oh No]\nIn the symphony, orchestrated, of course they hate it\nThe forces foreign, dangerous flow, painting a picture\nOff rhythmic movement, move with music\nMoods is muses, dumbfound stupid nuisance\nNew shit, hang \u2018em like nooses \u2018til their brain part\nTheir nucleus, I\u2019m nuke \u2018em and show \u2018em we do this\nGot no, foolish focus, I pray for my foes\nFolks posted unnoticed, near when the twin\u2019s bolstered\nI get toasted and toasted bottles of Moet\nThen pour it out for my old set\nGangrene, that\u2019s a threat on the globe\nVerbal tech, technicians, herbal vet load the ammunition\nMade them kill the ambition with this man\u2019s wisdom\nThen gas and match in the brain, more enlighten \u2018em\nPay attention or played attention\nY\u2019all lame, y\u2019all rather play in the Pain Olympics, uh\u2026Embed"}, {"_type":

\u2019twere not so, of some deretane denudation with intent to excitation, caused by his retrogradation, among firearmed forces proper to this nation but apart from all titillation which, he said, was under heat pressure and a good mitigation without which in any case he insists upon being worthy of continued alimentation for him having displayed, he says, such grand toleration, reprobate so noted

The Porters, so to speak, after their shadowstealers in the newsbaggers, are very nice people, are they not? Very, all fourlike tellt. And on this wise, Mr, Porter (Bar-tholomew, heavy man, astern, mackerel shirt, hayamatt peruke) is an excellent forefather and Mrs Porter (leading lady, a poopahead, gaffneysaffron nightdress, iszoppy chepelure) is a most kindhearted messmother. A so united family pateramater is not more existing on papel or off of it. As keymaster fits the lock it weds so this bally builder to his streamline secret. They care for nothing except everything that is allporterous. Porto da Brozzo! Isn\u2019t that terribly nice of them? You can ken that they come of a rarely old family by their costumance and one must togive that one supped of it in all tonearts from awe to zest. I think I begin to divine so much. Only snakkest me truesome! I stone us I\u2019m hable. To reachy a skeer do! Still hoyhra, till venstra! Here are two rooms on the upstairs, at forkflank and at knifekanter. Whom in the wood are they for? Why, for little Porter babes, to be saved! The coeds, boytom thwackers and timbuy teaser. Here is one. thing you owed two noe. This one once upon awhile was the other but this is the other one nighadays. Ah so? The Corsicos? They are numerable. Guest them. Major bed, minor bickhive. Halosobuth, sov us! Who sleeps in now number one, for ex-ample? A pussy, purr esimple. Cunina, Statulina and Edulia, but how sweet of her! Has your pussy a pessname? Yes, indeed, you will hear it passim in all the noveletta and she is named Buttercup. Her bare name will tellt it, a monitress. How very sweet of her and what an excessively lovecharming missyname to forsake, now that I come to drink of it filtred, a gracecup fulled of bitterness. She is dadad\u2019s lottiest daughterpearl and brooder\u2019s cissiest auntybride. Her shellback thimblecasket mirror only can show her dearest friendeen. To speak well her grace it would ask of Grecian language, of her goodness, that legend golden. Biryina Saindua! Loreas with lillias flocaflake arrosas! Here\u2019s newyearspray, the posquiflor, a windaborne and helio-trope; there miriamsweet and amaranth and marygold to crown. Add lightest knot unto tiptition. O Charis! O Charissima! A more intriguant bambolina could one not colour up out of Boccuccia\u2019s Enameron. Would one but to do apart a lilybit her virginelles and, so, to breath, so, therebetween, behold, she had instantt with her handmade as to graps the myth inmid the air. Mother of moth! I will to show herword in flesh. Approach not for ghost sake! Itis dormition! She may think, what though little doth she realise, as morning fresheth, it hath happened her, you know what, as they too what two dare not utter. Silvoo plush, if scolded she draws a face. Petticoat\u2019s asleep but in the gentlenest of her thoughts apoo is a nursepin. To be presented, Babs for Bim-bushi? Of courts and with enticers. Up, girls, and at him! Alone? Alone what? I mean, our strifestirrer, does she do fleurty winkies with herself Pussy is never alone, as records her chambrette, for she can always look at Biddles and talk petnames with her little playfilly when she is sitting downy on the ploshmat. O, she talks, does she? Marry, how? Rosepetalletted sounds. Ah Biddles es ma plikplak. Ah plikplak wed ma Biddles. A nice jezebel bary-tinette she will gift but I much prefer her missnomer in maidenly golden lasslike gladsome wenchful flowery girlish beautycapes. So do I, much. Dulce delicatissima! Doth Dolly weeps she is hastings. Will Dally bumpsetty it is tubtime. Allaliefest, she who pities very pebbles, dare we not wish on her our thrice onsk? A lovely fear! That she seventip toe her chrysming, that she spin blue to scarlad till her temple\u2019s veil, that the Mount of Whoam it open it her to shelterer! She will blow ever so much more pro-misefuller, blee me, than all the other common marygales that romp round brigidschool, charming Carry Whambers or saucy Susy Maucepan of Merry Anna Patchbox or silly Polly Flinders. Platsch! A plikaplak.\n\nAnd since we are talking amnessly of brukasloop crazedledaze, who doez in sleeproom number twobis? The twobirds. Holy policeman, O, I see! Of what age are your birdies? They are to come of twinning age so soon as they may be born to be eldering like those olders while they are living under chairs. They are and they seem to be so tightly tattached as two maggots to touch other, I think I notice, do I not? You do. Our bright bull babe Frank Kevin is on heartsleeveside. Do not you waken him! Our farheard bode. He is happily to sleep, limb of the Lord, with his lifted in blessing, his buchel Iosa, like the blissed angel he looks so like and his mou is semiope as though he were blowdelling on a bugigle. Whene\u2019er I see those smiles in eyes \u2019tis Father Quinn again. Very shortly he will smell sweetly when he will hear a weird to wean. By gorgeous, that boy will blare some knight when he will take his dane\u2019s pledges and quit our ingletears, spite of undesirable parents, to wend him to Amorica to quest a cashy job. That keen dean with his veen nonsolance! O, I adore the profeen music! Dollarmighty! He is too audorable really, eunique! I guess to have seen somekid like him in the story book, guess I met some-where somelam to whom he will be becoming liker. But hush! How unpardonable of me! I beg for your venials, sincerely I do.\n\nHush! The other, twined on codliverside, has been crying in his sleep, making sharpshape his inscissors on some first choice sweets fished out of the muck. A stake in our mead. What a teething wretch! How his book of craven images! Here are post-humious tears on his intimelle. And he has pipettishly bespilled himself from his foundingpen as illspent from inkinghorn. He is jem job joy pip poo pat (jot um for a sobrat!) Jerry Jehu. You will know him by name in the capers but you cannot see whose heel he sheepfolds in his wrought hand because I have not told it to you. O, foetal sleep! Ah, fatal slip! the one loved, the other left, the bride of pride leased to the stranger!He will be quite within the pale when with lordbeeron brow he vows him so tosset to be of the sir Blake tribes bleak while through life\u2019s unblest he rodes backs of bannars. Are you not somewhat bulgar with your bowels? Whatever do you mean with bleak? With pale blake I write tint-ingface. O, you do? And with steelwhite and blackmail I ha\u2019scint for my sweet an anemone\u2019s letter with a gold of my bridest hair betied. Donatus his mark, address as follows. So you did? From the Cat and Cage. O, I see and see! In the ink of his sweat he will find it yet. What Gipsy Devereux vowed to Lylian and why the elm and how the stone. You never may know in the preterite all perhaps that you would not believe that you ever even saw to be about to. Perhaps. But they are two very blizky little portereens after their bredscrums, Jerkoff and Eatsup, as for my part opinion indeed. They would be born so, costarred, puck and prig, the maryboy at Donnybrook Fair, the godolphing-lad in the Hoy\u2019s Court. How frilled one shall be as at taledold of Formio and Cigalette! What folly innocents! Theirs whet pep of puppyhood! Both barmhearts shall become yeastcake by their brackfest. I will to leave a my copperwise blessing between the pair of them, for rosengorge, for greenafang. Blech and tin soldies, weals in a sniffbox. Som\u2019s wholed, all\u2019s parted. Weeping shouldst not thou be when man falls but that divine scheming ever adoring be. So you be either man or mouse and you be neither fish nor flesh. Take. And take. Vellicate nyche! Be ones as wes for gives for gives now the hour of passings sembles quick with quelled. Adieu, soft adieu, for these nice presents, kerryjevin. Still tosorrow!\n\nJeminy, what is the view which now takes up a second position of discordance, tell it please? Mark! You notice it in that rereway because the male entail partially eclipses the femecovert. It is so called for its discord the meseedo. Do you ever heard the story about Helius Croesus, that white and gold elephant in our zoopark? You astonish me by it. Is it not that we are commanding from fullback, woman permitting, a profusely fine birdseye view from beauhind this park? Finn his park has been much the admiration of all the stranger ones, grekish and romanos, who arrive to here. The straight road down the centre (see relief map) bisexes the park which is said to be the largest of his kind in the world. On the right prominence confronts you the handsome vinesregent\u2019s lodge while, turning to the other supreme piece of cheeks, exactly opposite, you are confounded by the equally hand-some chief sacristary\u2019s residence. Around is a little amiably tufted and man is cheered when he bewonders through the boskage how the nature in all frisko is enlivened by gentlemen\u2019s seats. Here are heavysuppers \u2014 \u2019tis for daddies housings for hun-dredaires of our super thin thousand. By gum, but you have resin! Of these tallworts are yielded out juices for jointoils and pappasses for paynims. Listeneth! \u2019Tis a tree story. How olave, that firile, was aplantad in her liveside. How tannoboom held tonobloom. How rood in norlandes. The black and blue marks athwart the weald, which now barely is so stripped, indicate the presence of sylvious beltings. Therewithal shady rides lend themselves out to rustic cavalries. In yonder valley, too, stays mountain sprite. Any pretty dears are to be caught inside but it is a bad pities of the plain. A scarlet pimparnell now mules the mound where anciently first murders were wanted to take root. By feud fionghalian. Talkingtree and sinningstone stay on either hand. Hystorical leavesdroppings may also be gar-nered up with sir Shamus Swiftpatrick, Archfieldchaplain of Saint Lucan\u2019s. How familiar it is to see all these interesting advenements with one snaked\u2019s eyes! Is all? Yet not. Hear one\u2019s.

He is considered to have committed, invoking droit d\u2019oreiller, simple infidelities with Felicia, a virgin, and to be practising for unnatural coits with Eugenius and Jere-mias, two or three philadelphians. Honophrius, Felicia, Eugenius and Jeremias are consanguineous to the lowest degree. Anita the wife of Honophrius, has been told by her tirewoman, For-tissa, that Honuphrius has blasphemously confessed under volun \u2014 tary chastisement that he has instructed his slave, Mauritius, to ur;, e Magravius, a commercial, emulous of Honuphrius, to solicit the chastity of Anita. Anita is informed by some illegitimate children of Fortissa with Mauritius (the supposition is Ware\u2019s) that Gillia, the schismatical wife of Magravius, is visited clandes-tinely by Barnabas, the advocate of Honuphrius, an immoral person who has been corrupted by Jeremias. Gillia, (a cooler blend, D\u2019Alton insists) ex equo with Poppea, Arancita, Clara, Marinuzza, Indra and Iodina, has been tenderly debauched (in Halliday\u2019s view), by Honuphrius, and Magravius knows from spies that Anita has formerly committed double sacrilege with Michael, vulgo Cerularius, a perpetual curate, who wishes to seduce Eugenius. Magravius threatens to have Anita molested by Sulla, an orthodox savage (and leader of a band of twelve mercenaries, the Sullivani), who desires to procure Felicia for Gregorius, Leo, Vitellius and Macdugalius, four excavators, if she will not yield to him and also deceive Honuphrius by ren-dering conjugal duty when demanded. Anita who claims to have discovered incestuous temptations from Jeremias and Eugenius would yield to the lewdness of Honuphrius to appease the savagery of Sulla and the mercernariness of the twelve Sullivani, and (as Gilbert at first suggested), to save the virginity of Felicia for Magravius when converted by Michael after the death of Gillia, but she fears that, by allowing his marital rights she may cause reprehensible conduct between Eugenius and Jeremias. Michael, who has formerly debauched Anita, dispen-ses her from yielding to Honuphrius who pretends publicly to possess his conjunct in thirtynine several manners (turpiter! affirm ex cathedris Gerontes Cambronses) for camal hygiene whenever he has rendered himself impotent to consummate by subdolence. Anita is disturbed but Michael comminates that he will reserve her case tomorrow for the ordinary Guglielmus even if she should practise a pious fraud during affrication which, from experience, she knows (according to Wadding), to be leading to nullity. Fortissa, however, is encouraged by Gregorius, Leo, Viteilius, and Magdugalius, reunitedly, to warn Anita by describing the strong chastisements of Honuphrius and the depravities (turpissimas!) of Canicula, the deceased wife of Mauritius, with Sulla, the simoniac, who is abnegand and repents. Has he hegemony and shall she submit?\n\nTranslate a lax, you breed a bradaun. In the goods of Cape and Chattertone, deceased.\n\nThis, lay readers and gentilemen, is perhaps the commonest of all cases arising out of umbrella history in connection with the wood industries in our courts of litigation. D\u2019Oyly Owens holds (though Finn Magnusson of himself holds also) that so long as there is a joint deposit account in the two names a mutual obligation is posited. Owens cites Brerfuchs and Warren, a foreign firm, since disseized, registered as Tangos, Limited, for the sale of certain proprietary articles. The action which was at the instance of the trustee of the heathen church emergency fund, suing by its trustee, a resigned civil servant, for the pay-ment of tithes due was heard by Judge Doyle and also by a com \u2014 mon jury. No question arose as to the debt for which vouchers spoke volumes. The defence alleged that payment had been made effective. The fund trustee, one Jucundus Fecundus Xero Pecun-dus Coppercheap, counterclaimed that payment was invalid having been tendered to creditor under cover of a crossed cheque, signed in the ordinary course, in the name of Wieldhelm, Hurls Cross, voucher copy provided, and drawn by the senior partner only by whom the lodgment of the species had been effected but in their joint names. The bank particularised, the national misery (now almost entirely in the hands of the four chief bondholders for value in Tangos), declined to pay the draft, though there were ample reserves to meet the liability, whereupon the trusty Coppercheap negociated it for and on behalf of the fund of the thing to a client of his, a notary, from whom, on consideration, he received in exchange legal relief as between trusthee and bethrust, with thanks. Since then the cheque, a good washable pink, em-bossed D you D No 11 hundred and thirty 2, good for the figure and face, had been circulating in the country for over thirtynine years among holders of Pango stock, a rival concern, though not one demonetised farthing had ever spun or fluctuated across the counter in the semblance of hard coin or liquid cash. The jury (a sour dozen of stout fellows all of whom were curiously named after doyles) naturally disagreed jointly and severally, and the belligerent judge, disagreeing with the allied jurors\u2019 disagree-ment, went outside his jurisfiction altogether and ordered a gar \u2014 nishee attachment to the neutral firm. No mandamus could lo \u2014 cate the depleted whilom Breyfawkes as he had entered into an ancient moratorium, dating back to the times of the early barters, and only the junior partner Barren could be found, who entered an appearance and turned up, upon a notice of motion and after service of the motion by interlocutory injunction, among the male jurors to be an absolete turfwoman, originally from the proletarian class, with still a good title to her sexname of Ann Doyle, 2 Coppinger\u2019s Cottages, the Doyle\u2019s country. Doyle (Ann), add woman in, having regretfully left the juryboxers, protested cheerfully on the stand in a long jurymiad in re corset checks, delivered in doy-lish, that she had often, in supply to brusk demands rising almost to bollion point, discounted Mr Brakeforth\u2019s first of all in ex-change at nine months from date without issue and, to be strictly literal, unbottled in corrubberation a current account of how she had been made at sight for services rendered the payee-drawee of unwashable blank assignations, sometimes pinkwilliams (laughter) but more often of the cr\u0160me-de-citron, vair \u201amail paon-coque or marshmallow series, which she, as bearer, used to en \u2014 dorse, adhesively, to her various payers-drawers who in most cases were identified by the timber papers as wellknown tetigists of the city and suburban. The witness, at her own request, asked if she might and wrought something between the sheets of music paper which she had accompanied herself with for the occasion and this having been handed up for the bench to look at in camera, Coppinger\u2019s doll, as she was called, (annias, Mack Erse\u2019s Dar, the adopted child) then proposed to jerrykin and jureens and every jim, jock and jarry in that little green courtinghousie for her satis-faction and as a whole act of settlement to reamalgamate herself, tomorrow perforce, in pardonership with the permanent suing fond trustee, Monsignore Pepigi, under the new style of Will Break-fast and Sparrem, as, when all his cognisances had been estreated, he seemed to proffer the steadiest interest towards her, but this prepoposal was ruled out on appeal by Judge Jeremy Doyler, who, reserving judgment in a matter of courts and reversing the find-ings of the lower correctional, found, beyond doubt of treuson, fending the dissassents of the pickpackpanel, twelve as upright judaces as ever let down their thoms, and, occupante extremum scabie, handed down to the jury of the Liffey that, as a matter of tact, the woman they gave as free was born into contractual incapacity (the Calif of Man v the Eaudelusk Company) when, how and where mamy\u2019s mancipium act did not apply and therefore held supremely that, as no property in law can exist in a corpse, (Hal Kilbride v Una Bellina) Pepigi\u2019s pact was pure piffle (loud laughter) and Wharrem would whistle for the rhino.

Next, upon due reflotation, up started four hurrigan gales to smithereen his plateglass house-walls and the slate for accounts his keeper was cooking. Then came three boy buglehorners who counterbezzled and cross-bugled him. Later on in the same evening two hussites ab \u2014 sconded through a breach in his bylaws and left him, the infidels, to pay himself off in kind remembrances.

From of Mayasdaysed most duteoused.\n\nWell, here\u2019s lettering you erronymously anent other clerical fands allieged herewith. I wisht I wast be that dumb tyke and he\u2019d wish it was me yonther heel. How about it? The sweetest song in the world! Our shape as a juvenile being much admired from the first with native copper locks. Referring to the Married Woman\u2019s Improperty Act a correspondent paints out that the Swees Aubumn vogue is hanging down straith fitting to her innocenth eyes. O, felicious coolpose! If all the MacCrawls would only handle virgils like Armsworks, Limited! That\u2019s handsel for gertles! Never mind Micklemans! Chat us instead! The cad with the pope\u2019s wife, Lily Kinsella, who became the wife of Mr Sneakers for her good name in the hands of the kissing solicitor, will now engage in attentions. Just a prinche for to-night! Pale bellies our mild cure, back and streaky ninepace. The thicks off Bully\u2019s Acre was got up by Sully. The Boot lane brigade. And she had a certain medicine brought her in a licenced victualler\u2019s bottle. Shame! Thrice shame! We are advised the waxy is at the present in the Sweeps hospital and that he may never come out! Only look through your leather-box one day with P.C.Q. about 4.32 or at 8 and 22.5 with the quart of scissions masters and clerk and the bevyhum of Marie Reparatrices for a good allround sympowdhericks purge, full view, to be surprised to see under the grand piano Lily on the sofa (and a lady!) pulling a low and then he\u2019d begin to jump a little bit to find out what goes on when love walks in besides the solicitous bussness by kissing and looking into a mirror.\n\nThat we were treated not very grand when the police and everybody is all bowing to us when we go out in all directions on Wanterlond Road with my cubarola glide? And, personably speaking, they can make their beaux to my alce, as Hillary Allen sang to the opernnine knighters. Item, we never were chained to a chair, and, bitem, no widower whother soever followed us about with a fork on Yankskilling Day. Meet a great civilian (proud lives to him!) who is gentle as a mushroom and a very affectable when he always sits forenenst us for his wet while to all whom it may concern Sully is a thug from all he drunk though he is a rattling fine bootmaker in his profession. Would we were here-arther to lodge our complaint on sergeant Laraseny in consequence of which in such steps taken his health would be constably broken into potter\u2019s pance which would be the change of his life by a Nollwelshian which has been oxbelled out of crispianity.\n\nWell, our talks are coming to be resumed by more polite conversation with a huntered persent human over the natural bestness of pleisure after his good few mugs of humbedumb and shag. While for whoever likes that urogynal pan of cakes one apiece it is thanks, beloved, to Adam, our former first Finnlatter and our grocerest churcher, as per Grippiths\u2019 varuations, for his beautiful crossmess parzel.\n\nWell, we simply like their demb cheeks, the Rathgarries, wagging here about around the rhythms in me amphybed and he being as bothered that he pausably could by the fallth of hampty damp. Certified reformed peoples, we may add to this stage, are proptably saying to quite agreeable deef. Here gives your answer, pigs and scuts! Hence we\u2019ve lived in two worlds. He is another he what stays under the himp of holth. The herewaker of our hamefame is his real namesame who will get himself up and erect, confident and heroic when but, young as of old, for my daily comfreshenall, a wee one woos.\n\nAlma Luvia, Pollabella. P.S. Soldier Rollo\u2019s sweetheart. And she\u2019s about fetted up now with nonsery reams. And rigs out in regal rooms with the ritzies. Rags! Worns out. But she\u2019s still her deckhuman amber too.\n\nSoft morning, city! Lsp! I am leafy speafing. Lpf! Folty and folty all the nights have falled on to long my hair. Not a sound, falling. Lispn! No wind no word. Only a leaf, just a leaf and then leaves. The woods are fond always. As were we their babes in. And robins in crews so. It is for me goolden wending. Unless? Away! Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so long! Or is it only so mesleems? On your pondered palm. Reclined from cape to pede. With pipe on bowl. Terce for a fiddler, sixt for makmerriers, none for a Cole. Rise up now and aruse! Norvena\u2019s over. I am leafy, your goolden, so you called me, may me life, yea your goolden, silve me solve, exsogerraider! You did so drool. I was so sharm. But there\u2019s a great poet in you too. Stout Stokes would take you offly. So has he as bored me to slump. But am good and rested. Taks to you, toddy, tan ye! Yawhawaw. Helpunto min, helpas vin. Here is your shirt, the day one, come back. The stock, your collar. Also your double brogues. A comforter as well. And here your iverol and everthelest your umbr. And stand up tall! Straight. I want to see you looking fine for me. With your brandnew big green belt and all. Blooming in the very lotust and second to nill, Budd! When you\u2019re in the buckly shuit Rosensharonals near did for you. Fiftyseven and three, cosh, with the bulge. Proudpurse Alby with his pooraroon Eireen, they\u2019ll. Pride, comfytousness, enevy! You make me think of a wonderdecker I once. Or somebalt thet sailder, the man me-gallant, with the bangled ears. Or an earl was he, at Lucan? Or, no, it\u2019s the Iren duke\u2019s I mean. Or somebrey erse from the Dark Countries. Come and let us! We always said we\u2019d. And go abroad. Rathgreany way perhaps. The childher are still fast. There is no school today. Them boys is so contrairy. The Head does be worrying himself. Heel trouble and heal travel. Galliver and Gellover. Unless they changes by mistake. I seen the likes in the twinngling of an aye. Som. So oft. Sim. Time after time. The sehm asnuh. Two bredder as doffered as nors in soun. When one of him sighs or one of him cries \u2019tis you all over. No peace at all. Maybe it\u2019s those two old crony aunts held them out to the water front. Queer Mrs Quickenough and odd Miss Dodd-pebble. And when them two has had a good few there isn\u2019t much more dirty clothes to publish. From the Laundersdale Minssions. One chap googling the holyboy\u2019s thingabib and this lad wetting his widdle. You were pleased as Punch, recitating war exploits and pearse orations to them jackeen gapers. But that night after, all you were wanton! Bidding me do this and that and the other. And blowing off to me, hugly Judsys, what wouldn\u2019t you give to have a girl! Your wish was mewill. And, lo, out of a sky! The way I too. But her, you wait. Eager to choose is left to her shade. If she bad only more matcher\u2019s wit. Findlings makes runaways, runaways a stray. She\u2019s as merry as the gricks still. \u2018Twould be sore should ledden sorrow. I\u2019ll wait. And I\u2019ll wait. And then if all goes. What will be is. Is is. But let them. Slops hospodch and the slusky slut too. He\u2019s for thee what she\u2019s for me. Dogging you round cove and haven and teaching me the perts of speech. If you spun your yarns to him on the swishbarque waves I was spelling my yearns to her over cottage cake. We\u2019ll not disturb their sleep- ing duties. Let besoms be bosuns. It\u2019s Phoenix, dear. And the flame is, hear! Let\u2019s our joornee saintomichael make it. Since the lausafire has lost and the book of the depth is. Closed. Come! Step out of your shell! Hold up you free fing! Yes. We\u2019ve light enough. I won\u2019t take our laddy\u2019s lampern. For them four old windbags of Gustsofairy to be blowing at. Nor you your ruck-sunck. To bring all the dannymans out after you on the hike. Send Arctur guiddus! Isma! Sft! It is the softest morning that ever I can ever remember me. But she won\u2019t rain showerly, our Ilma. Yet. Until it\u2019s the time. And me and you have made our. The sons of bursters won in the games. Still I\u2019ll take me owld Finvara for my shawlders. The trout will be so fine at brookfisht. With a taste of roly polony from Blugpuddels after. To bring out the tang of the tay. Is\u2019t you fain for a roost brood? Oaxmealturn, all out of the woolpalls! And then all the chippy young cuppinjars cluttering round us, clottering for their creams. Crying, me, grownup sister! Are me not truly? Lst! Only but, theres a but, you must buy me a fine new girdle too, nolly. When next you go to Market Norwall. They\u2019re all saying I need it since the one from Isaacsen\u2019s slooped its line. Mrknrk? Fy arthou! Come ! Give me your great bearspaw, padder avilky, fol a miny tiny. Dola. Mineninecy-handsy, in the languo of flows. That\u2019s Jorgen Jargonsen. But you understood, nodst? I always know by your brights and shades. Reach down. A lil mo. So. Draw back your glave. Hot and hairy, hugon, is your hand! Here\u2019s where the falskin begins. Smoos as an infams. One time you told you\u2019d been burnt in ice. And one time it was chemicalled after you taking a lifeness. Maybe that\u2019s why you hold your hodd as if. And people thinks you missed the scaffold. Of fell design. I\u2019ll close me eyes. So not to see. Or see only a youth in his florizel, a boy in innocence, peeling a twig, a child be-side a weenywhite steed. The child we all love to place our hope in for ever. All men has done something. Be the time they\u2019ve come to the weight of old fletch. We\u2019ll lave it. So. We will take our walk before in the timpul they ring the earthly bells. In the church by the hearseyard. Pax Goodmens will. Or the birds start their treestirm shindy. Look, there are yours off, high on high! And cooshes, sweet good luck they\u2019re cawing you, Coole! You see, they\u2019re as white as the riven snae. For us. Next peaters poll you will be elicted or I\u2019m not your elicitous bribe. The Kinsella woman\u2019s man will never reduce me. A MacGarath O\u2019Cullagh O\u2019Muirk MacFewney sookadoodling and sweepacheeping round the lodge of Fjorn na Galla of the Trumpets! It\u2019s like potting the po to shambe on the dresser or tamming Uncle Tim\u2019s Caubeen on to the brows of a Viker Eagle. Not such big strides, huddy foddy! You\u2019ll crush me antilopes I saved so long for. They\u2019re Penisole\u2019s. And the two goodiest shoeshoes. It is hardly a Knut\u2019s mile or seven, possumbotts. It is very good for the health of a morning. With Buahbuah. A gentle motion all around. As leisure paces. And the helpyourselftoastrool cure\u2019s easy. It seems so long since, ages since. As if you had been long far away. Afartodays, afeartonights, and me as with you in thadark. You will tell me some time if I can believe its all. You know where I am bringing you? You remember? When I ran berrying after hucks and haws. With you drawing out great aims to hazel me from the hummock with your sling. Our cries. I could lead you there and I still by you in bed. Les go dutc to Danegreven, nos? Not a soul but ourselves. Time? We have loads on our hangs. Till Gilligan and Halligan call again to hooligan. And the rest of the guns. Sullygan eight, from left to right. Olobobo, ye foxy theagues! The moskors thought to ball you out. Or the Wald Unicorns Master, Bugley Captain, from the Naul, drawls up by the door with the Honourable Whilp and the Reverend Poynter and the two Lady Pagets of Tallyhaugh, Ballyhuntus, in their riddletight raiding hats for to lift a hereshealth to their robost, the Stag, evers the Carlton hart. And you needn\u2019t host out with your duck and your duty, capapole, while they reach him the glass he never starts to finish. Clap this wis on your poll and stick this in your ear, wiggly! Beauties don\u2019t answer and the rich never pays. If you were the enlarged they\u2019d hue in cry you, Heathtown, Harbourstown, Snowtown, Four Knocks, Fleming-town, Bodingtown to the Ford of Fyne on Delvin. How they housed to house you after the Platonic garlens! And all because, loosed in her reflexes, she seem she seen Ericoricori coricome huntsome with his three poach dogs aleashing him. But you came safe through. Enough of that homer corner! And old mutther-goosip! We might call on the Old Lord, what do you say? There\u2019s something tells me. He is a fine sport. Like the score and a moighty went before him. And a proper old promnentory. His door always open. For a newera\u2019s day. Much as your own is. You invoiced him last Eatster so he ought to give us hockockles and everything. Remember to take off your white hat, ech? When we come in the presence. And say hoothoothoo, ithmuthisthy! His is house of laws. And I\u2019ll drop my graciast kertssey too. If the Ming Tung no go bo to me homage me hamage kow bow tow to the Mong Tang. Ceremonialness to stand lowest place be! Saying: What\u2019ll you take to link to light a pike on porpoise, plaise? He might knight you an Armor elsor daub you the first cheap magyerstrape. Remember Bomthomanew vim vam vom Hungerig. Hoteform, chain and epolettes, botherbumbose. And I\u2019ll be your aural eyeness. But we vain. Plain fancies. It\u2019s in the castles air. My currant bread\u2019s full of sillymottocraft. Aloof is anoof. We can take or leave. He\u2019s reading his ruffs. You\u2019ll know our way from there surely. Flura\u2019s way. Where once we led so many car couples have follied since. Clatchka! Giving Shaugh-nessy\u2019s mare the hillymount of her life. With her strulldeburg \u2014 ghers! Hnmn hnmn! The rollcky road adondering. We can sit us down on the heathery benn, me on you, in quolm uncon-sciounce. To scand the arising. Out from Drumleek. It was there Evora told me I had best. If I ever. When the moon of mourning is set and gone. Over Glinaduna. Lonu nula. Ourselves, oursouls alone. At the site of salvocean. And watch would the letter you\u2019re wanting be coming may be. And cast ashore. That I prays for be mains of me draims. Scratching it and patching at with a prompt from a primer. And what scrips of nutsnolleges I pecked up me meself Every letter is a hard but yours sure is the hardest crux ever. Hack an axe, hook an oxe, hath an an, heth hith ences. But once done, dealt and delivered, tattat, you\u2019re on the map. Rased on traumscrapt from Maston, Boss. After rounding his world of ancient days. Carried in a caddy or screwed and corked. On his mugisstosst surface. With a bob, bob, bottledby. Blob. When the waves give up yours the soil may for me. Sometime then, somewhere there, I wrote me hopes and buried the page when I heard Thy voice, ruddery dunner, so loud that none but, and left it to lie till a kissmiss coming. So content me now. Lss. Unbuild and be buildn our bankaloan cottage there and we\u2019ll cohabit respectable. The Gowans, ser, for Medem, me. With acute bubel runtoer for to pippup and gopeep where the sterres be. Just to see would we hear how Jove and the peers talk. Amid the soleness. Tilltop, bigmaster! Scale the summit! You\u2019re not so giddy any more. All your graundplotting and the little it brought! Humps, when you hised us and dumps, when you doused us! But sarra one of me cares a brambling ram, pomp porteryark! On limpidy marge I\u2019ve made me hoom. Park and a pub for me. Only don\u2019t start your stunts of Donachie\u2019s yeards agoad again. I could guessp to her name who tuckt you that one, tuf-nut! Bold bet backwords. For the loves of sinfintins! Before the naked universe. And the bailby pleasemarm rincing his eye! One of these fine days, lewdy culler, you must redoform again. Blessed shield Martin! Softly so. I am so exquisitely pleased about the loveleavest dress I have. You will always call me Leafiest, won\u2019t you, dowling? Wordherfhull Ohldhbhoy! And you won\u2019t urbjunk to me parafume, oiled of kolooney, with a spot of mara-shy. Sm! It\u2019s Alpine Smile from Yesthers late Yhesters. I\u2019m in everywince nasturtls. Even in Houlth\u2019s nose. Medeurscodeignus! Astale of astoun. Grand owld marauder! If I knew who you are! When that hark from the air said it was Captain Finsen makes cum-hulments and was mayit pressing for his suit I said are you there here\u2019s nobody here only me. But I near fell off the pile of samples. As if your tinger winged ting to me hear. Is that right what your brothermilk in Bray bes telling the district you were bragged up by Brostal because your parents would be always tumbling into his foulplace and losing her pentacosts after drinking their pledges? Howsomendeavour, you done me fine! The only man was ever known could eat the crushts of lobsters. Our native night when you twicetook me for some Marienne Sherry and then your Jermyn cousin who signs hers with exes and the beard-wig I found in your Clarksome bag. Pharaops you\u2019ll play you\u2019re the king of Aeships. You certainly make the most royal of noises. I will tell you all sorts of makeup things, strangerous. And show you to every simple storyplace we pass. Cadmillersfolly, Bellevenue, Wellcrom, Quid Superabit, villities valleties. Change the plates for the next course of murphies! Spendlove\u2019s still there and the canon going strong and so is Claffey\u2019s habits endurtaking and our parish pomp\u2019s a great warrent. But you\u2019ll have to ask that same four that named them is always snugging in your bar-salooner, saying they\u2019re the best relicts of Conal O\u2019Daniel and writing Finglas since the Flood. That\u2019ll be some kingly work in pro-gress. But it\u2019s by this route he\u2019ll come some morrow. And I can signal you all flint and fern are rasstling as we go by. And you\u2019ll sing thumb a bit and then wise your selmon on it. It is all so often and still the same to me. Snf? Only turf, wick dear! Clane turf. You\u2019ve never forgodden batt on tarf, have you, at broin burroow, what? Mch? Why, them\u2019s the muchrooms, come up during the night. Look, agres of roofs in parshes. Dom on dam, dim in dym. And a capital part for olympics to ply at. Steadyon, Cooloosus! Mind your stride or you\u2019ll knock. While I\u2019m dodging the dustbins. Look what I found! A lintil pea. And look at here! This cara weeseed. Pretty mites, my sweetthings, was they poor-loves abandoned by wholawidey world? Neighboulotts for new \u2014 town. The Eblanamagna you behazyheld loomening up out of the dumblynass. But the still sama sitta. I\u2019ve lapped so long. As you said. It fair takes. If I lose my breath for a minute or two don\u2019t speak, remember! Once it happened, so it may again. Why I\u2019m all these years within years in soffran, allbeleaved. To hide away the tear, the parted. It\u2019s thinking of all. The brave that gave their. The fair that wore. All them that\u2019s gunne. I\u2019ll begin again in a jiffey. The nik of a nad. How glad you\u2019ll be I waked you! My! How well you\u2019ll feel! For ever after. First we turn by the vagurin here and then it\u2019s gooder. So side by side, turn agate, wedding-town, laud men of Londub! I only hope whole the heavens sees us. For I feel I could near to faint away. Into the deeps. Anna-mores leep. Let me lean, just a lea, if you le, bowldstrong big \u2014 tider. Allgearls is wea. At times. So. While you\u2019re adamant evar. Wrhps, that wind as if out of norewere! As on the night of the Apophanypes. Jumpst shootst throbbst into me mouth like a bogue and arrohs! Ludegude of the Lashlanns, how he whips me cheeks! Sea, sea! Here, weir, reach, island, bridge. Where you meet I. The day. Remember! Why there that moment and us two only? I was but teen, a tiler\u2019s dot. The swankysuits was boosting always, sure him, he was like to me fad. But the swag-gerest swell off Shackvulle Strutt. And the fiercest freaky ever followed a pining child round the sluppery table with a forkful of fat. But a king of whistlers. Scieoula! When he\u2019d prop me atlas against his goose and light our two candles for our singers duohs on the sewingmachine. I\u2019m sure he squirted juice in his eyes to make them flash for flightening me. Still and all he was awful fond to me. Who\u2019ll search for Find Me Colours now on the hilly-droops of Vikloefells? But I read in Tobecontinued\u2019s tale that while blubles blows there\u2019ll still be sealskers. There\u2019ll be others but non so for me. Yed he never knew we seen us before. Night after night. So that I longed to go to. And still with all. One time you\u2019d stand fornenst me, fairly laughing, in your bark and tan billows of I branches for to fan me coolly. And I\u2019d lie as quiet as a moss. And one time you\u2019d rush upon me, darkly roaring, like a great black | shadow with a sheeny stare to perce me rawly. And I\u2019d frozen up and pray for thawe. Three times in all. I was the pet of everyone then. A princeable girl. And you were the pantymammy\u2019s Vulking Corsergoth. The invision of Indelond. And, by Thorror, you looked it! My lips went livid for from the joy of fear. Like almost now. How? How you said how you\u2019d give me the keys of me heart. And we\u2019d be married till delth to uspart. And though dev do espart. O mine! Only, no, now it\u2019s me who\u2019s got to give. As duv herself div. Inn this linn. And can it be it\u2019s nnow fforvell? Illas! I wisht I had better glances to peer to you through this bay-light\u2019s growing. But you\u2019re changing, acoolsha, you\u2019re changing from me, I can feel. Or is it me is? I\u2019m getting mixed. Brightening up and tightening down. Yes, you\u2019re changing, sonhusband, and you\u2019re turning, I can feel you, for a daughterwife from the hills again. Imlamaya. And she is coming. Swimming in my hindmoist. Diveltaking on me tail. Just a whisk brisk sly spry spink spank sprint of a thing theresomere, saultering. Saltarella come to her own. I pity your oldself I was used to. Now a younger\u2019s there. Try not to part! Be happy, dear ones! May I be wrong! For she\u2019ll be sweet for you as I was sweet when I came down out of me mother. My great blue bedroom, the air so quiet, scarce a cloud. In peace and silence. I could have stayed up there for always only. It\u2019s something fails us. First we feel. Then we fall. And let her rain now if she likes. Gently or strongly as she likes. Anyway let her rain for my time is come. I done me best when I was let. Thinking always if I go all goes. A hundred cares, a tithe of troubles and is there one who understands me? One in a thousand of years of the nights? All me life I have been lived among them but now they are becoming lothed to me. And I am lothing their little warm tricks. And lothing their mean cosy turns. And all the greedy gushes out through their small souls. And all the lazy leaks down over their brash bodies. How small it\u2019s all! And me letting on to meself always. And lilting on all the time. I thought you were all glittering with the noblest of carriage. You\u2019re only a bumpkin. I thought you the great in all things, in guilt and in glory. You\u2019re but a puny. Home! My people were not their sort out beyond there so far as I can. For all the bold and bad and bleary they are blamed, the seahags. No! Nor for all our wild dances in all their wild din. I can seen meself among them, alla-niuvia pulchrabelled. How she was handsome, the wild Amazia, when she would seize to my other breast! And what is she weird, haughty Niluna, that she will snatch from my ownest hair! For \u2019tis they are the stormies. Ho hang! Hang ho! And the clash of our cries till we spring to be free. Auravoles, they says, never heed of your name! But I\u2019m loothing them that\u2019s here and all I lothe. Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O bitter ending! I\u2019ll slip away before they\u2019re up. They\u2019ll never see. Nor know. Nor miss me. And it\u2019s old and old it\u2019s sad and old it\u2019s sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere size of him, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me seasilt saltsick and I rush, my only, into your arms. I see them rising! Save me from those therrble prongs! Two more. Onetwo moremens more. So. Avelaval. My leaves have drifted from me. All. But one clings still. I\u2019ll bear it on me. To remind me of. Lff! So soft this morning, ours. Yes. Carry me along, taddy, like you done through the toy fair! If I seen him bearing down on me now under whitespread wings like he\u2019d come from Arkangels, I sink I\u2019d die down over his feet, humbly dumbly, only to washup. Yes, tid. There\u2019s where.

Finally he gave orders to prepare his country house for him within four weeks and then one day between the middle and the end of May he took the night train to Trieste, where he only stopped for twenty-four hours and the next day embarked for Pola. What he was looking for was the unfamiliar and unrelated, which was indeed reached rather easily and so he stayed on a celebrated Adriatic island, situated not far from the Istrian coast, with a gaily ragged people that conversed in an alien-sounding language and with picturesquely broken cliffs where the sea was open. Unfortunately, heavy rain and an oppressive atmosphere, a parochial and completely Austrian company in the hotel and the lack of calm and easy communion with the sea which only a soft-sloping and sandy beach can afford, caused him distress, prevented in him the feeling that he had reached his destination; an innermost calling of his, he did not know to where, caused him alarm, he studied the passenger ship routes, he looked around searchingly, and all of a sudden, at the same time surprising and expected, his destination became clear to him. When one wanted to see something without equal, the romantically different, where would one go? There could be no question about it. What was he supposed to do here? He had erred. He should have had traveled to that other location in the first place. He did not hesitate to immediately cancel his abortive stay on the island. One-and-a-half weeks after his arrival on the island, at hazy dawn a fast launch took him and his luggage back to the military harbor and there he only went ashore to directly step onto the damp deck of a ship bound for Venice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a vehicle under an Italian flag, stricken with years, outmoded, serene, and somber. In a cave-like, artificially-lit berth, into which Aschenbach had been instantly ushered with grinning courtesy by a humpbacked and dirty sailor after setting foot onto the ship, there sat a behind a table with his hat slanted on his head and with a cigarette butt between his lips a goatish man who had the physiognomy of an old-fashioned circus director, who with artificially easy demeanor registered the nationalities of the travelers and handed them their tickets. \"To Venice!\" he repeated Aschenbach's request, straightening his arm and pushing the quill into the pulpy remains of an inclined inkstand. \"First class to Venice! Here you are, sir!\" And he wrote with huge loops, dispensed some blue sand from a can onto the writing, let the sand run into a clay bowl, folded the paper with yellow and bony fingers and continued his writing. \"A happily chosen destination!\" he chattered meanwhile. \"Ah, Venice! A magnificent city! A city full of irresistible attraction to the well-educated, both due to its history and its present charms!\" The smooth dispatch of his movements and the empty talk that accompanied them had something stupefying and distracting, almost as if he feared the passenger might waver in his determination to go to Venice. He speedily cashed the money and let the change fall onto the dirty tablecloth with the dexterity of a croupier. \"Have a nice day, sir!\" he said with a thespian bow. \"It is my honor to convey you. . . Next please!\" he cried with a raised arm, pretending his business was lively even though there was nobody else around who needed a ticket. Aschenbach returned onto the deck.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Leaning with one arm on the handrail, he contemplated both the idle people who were mooching at the pier to witness the ship's departure and his fellow passengers. Those of the second class were crouching on the foredeck, using boxes and bundles as seats. A group of young people formed the company of the first deck, apparently tradesman's apprentices from Pola who had merrily united for a trip to Italy. They made a lot of fuss about themselves and their enterprise, chattered, laughed, contentedly enjoyed their own gesticulating and mocked those colleagues, who, portfolios tucked under their arms, were walking along the street to pursue their business and who made threatening gestures to the departing. One in a bright yellow, excessively fashionable summer suit, red tie, and a boldly bent up panama hat, exceeded all the others with his shrill voice and gayness. No sooner had Aschenbach set eyes on him than he realized with a kind of terror that this ephebe was false. He was ancient, there could be no doubt about it. Wrinkles surrounded his mouth and eyes. The meek crimson of his cheeks was makeup, that brown hair below the colorfully-banded straw hat was a wig, his neck was dilapidated and sinewy, his moustache was dyed, his yellowish and complete set of teeth which he laughingly presented was a cheap counterfeit, and his hands with signet rings on both index fingers were that of a very old man. With a shudder Aschenbach looked at him and his communion with his friends. Did they not know or notice they he was elderly, that he was wrongfully appropriating their garish dress, fraudulently played one of theirs? As if nothing had happened, seemingly out of habit, they tolerated him among themselves, treated him as an equal, answered his teasing nudges without disgust. How could that be? Aschenbach covered his forehead with his hand and closed his eyes that were burning from a lack of sleep.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He felt as if reality was becoming unreal, as if a dreamlike enchantment had begun, a shift of the world into the inexplicable, which perhaps could be opposed by closing his eyes and then taking another look. But in that moment he became aware of a sensation of floating and strangely startled he realized that the heavy and dark mass of the ship had detached itself from the quay. Inch by inch, with the engine running alternately forwards and backwards, the strip of dirtily iridescent water between the ship's hull and the shore widened, and after some stodgy maneuvers, the steamer's bow was pointing towards the open sea. Aschenbach went over the the starboard side, where the humpbacked sailor had prepared a deck chair for him and a steward in a spotted dress coat awaited his orders.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sky was gray, the wind moist; the harbor and the islands had receded, and soon land was no longer visible. A snow of coal dust, soaked with humidity, settled on the freshly-scrubbed deck that refused to dry. After about an hour the tent roof was deployed, as it had begun to rain.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wrapped in his coat, a book in his lap, the traveler rested and time seemed to fly. The rain had ceased; the linen roof was removed. The horizon was complete. Beneath the broad cupola of the sky the enormous disc of the barren sea extended all around; but in that empty, measureless space our sense of time also suffers, and we daze in the disorienting shapelessness. Strange and shade-like creatures, the senescent dandy, the goat-bearded man from below decks, traipsed with vague gestures and confused dream- words through the mind of the reclining artist, and eventually he fell asleep.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At noon he was required to venture below into the corridor-like dining hall, which was bordered on by the sleeping bunks, eating the ordered meal at a long table, on the other side of which the apprentices, including the senex, had been drinking heavily with the jolly captain since ten o'clock. The meal was meager and he quickly finished it. He wanted to go outside, to look at the sky: if maybe it would brighten in the direction of Venice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He did not anticipate anything else, for the city had always received him with splendor. But the sky and the sea remained cloudy and leaden, at times a fog-like drizzle fell, and slowly he accepted that he would, reaching it by water, discover a vastly different Venice from that which he had approached over land. He stood next to the foremast, gazing into the distance, expecting to see land. He thought of that melancholy-enthusiastic poet who had met the cupolas and bell towers of his dreams in this place, he quietly recalled some of the products of that awe-stricken, happy, and sad mood and moved by that ready-made emotion he wondered whether he, although more somber and tired than then, would meet that state of rapture and confusion a second time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then to his right the soft-sloping shore appeared, fishing boats made the sea lively, the Lido came into view, the steamer passed it on the right, gliding slowly through the channel of the same name and close to the lagoon it came to a rest entirely in full view of the poor and gaudy houses, since the barge of the sanitary service had to be met.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An hour passed before it materialized. One had reached one's destination and yet one had not; there was no hurry and yet one soon got impatient. The youths of Pola, perhaps also drawn to the military trumpet signals that echoed over the waters, had come on deck, and, enthusiastic from the Asti they had drunken, they cheered the Bersaglieri who were being drilled there. But it was repugnant to witness the state into which his faux communion with youth had brought the overdressed old man. His old and faded brain had not been able to resist the liquor to the same degree as the real youths, he was hopelessly drunk. Looking stupidly around, a cigarette between his trembling fingers, he swayed, barely able to keep his balance, pulled to and fro by his intoxication. Because he would have fallen down at the very first step, he did not dare to move, yet still displayed a sorry cockiness, holding on to everyone who approached him, speaking with a slur, winking, giggling, raising his ringed and wrinkled index finger to tease ridiculously, and licking the corners of his mouth in the most distastefully ambiguous manner. Aschenbach watched him with an expression of anger, and again he got a feeling of unreality, as if the world showed a small but definite tendency to slip into the peculiar and grotesque; a sensation which the resumption of the pounding work of the engine kept him from exploring fully, as the ship returned to its course through the San Marco canal. So he again set eyes on the most astounding landing, that blinding composition of fantastic architecture, which the Republic has to offer the awestruck looks of the approaching seafarer: the light grandeur of the Palace and the Bridge of Sighs, the columns topped with the lion and the saint close to the shore, the flauntingly projecting flank of St Mark's, the view of St Mark's Clock, and thus contemplating he thought that arriving in Venice from the train station was like entering a palace through the servants' entrance and that one should always, like himself, travel across the ocean to the most improbable of cities.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The engine stopped, gondolas approached, the accommodation ladder was low-ered, the customs officials came aboard and carried out their duty; the debarkation could begin. Aschenbach made it clear that he desired a gondola to bring him and his luggage to the landing of the smaller steamers that cruise between the city and the Lido; because he wanted a room close to the sea. His wish is approved and hollered towards the water, where the gondoliers are quarreling in dialect. He is unable to descend, as his trunk is taken with great effort down the ladder-like stairs.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So he cannot get away for several minutes from the intrusiveness of the ghastly old man, who is compelled by his drunkenness to bid the foreigner good-bye. \"We are wishing a most enjoyable stay One hopes to be remembered well! Au revoir, excusez and bonjour, Your Excellency!\" His mouth is watering, he winks, licks the corners of his mouth and the dyed moustache on his lips is ruffled up. \"Our compliments,\" he continues with two fingertips at his mouth, \"our compliments to your sweetheart, the most lovely and beautiful sweetheart. . . \" And suddenly the upper row of his false teeth drops onto his tongue. Aschenbach was able to escape. \"To your sweetheart, the most pretty sweetheart,\" he heard in hollow and somewhat obstructed speech behind his back while he descended the ladder.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who would not have had to fight a slight unease, a secret resentment and trepidation when one, for the first or after a long time, had to get into a Venetian gondola? That strange vehicle, which seems unchanged from more fanciful times and which is so strangely black like normally only coffins are, reminds one of silent and criminal adventures in the lapping night, furthermore it is reminiscent of death itself, the bier, the drab funeral and the final, wordless ride. And has one noticed that the coffin-black-varnished, black-upholstered chair in such a barge is the softest, most luxurious, most deeply relaxing seat in the whole world? Aschenbach noticed it when he took his place at the feet of the gondolier, with his luggage orderly arranged at the front of the gondola. The rowers were still quarreling, in a raw and incomprehensible way, with menacing gestures. But the peculiar quietude of the city on the sea seemed to absorb and disembody their voices and to disperse them above the water. It was fairly hot in the harbor. Touched by the warm scirocco, seated on tender cushions, the traveler closed his eyes to enjoy that kind of unusual and sweet lassitude. The trip will be short, he thought; oh would it last forever! The noiseless rocking let him put a distance between himself and that boisterous jostle.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How it became even more still around him all the time! Nothing could be heard except the lapping of the oar, the hollow impact of the waves against the tip of the gondola, that stood erect, dark and like a spear above the water and a third thing, the whispering and murmuring of the gondolier, who was talking to himself between his clenched teeth in occasional outbursts. Aschenbach raised his head and with a slight bemusement he noticed that the lagoon around him widened and the his course was towards the open sea. Therefore it seemed he should not relax too much but instead supervise the carrying out of his orders.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\"To the steamship landing, please!\" he said, turning over his shoulder. The murmuring ceased. He got no reply.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\"To the steamship landing!\" he repeated and turned around completely to look up into the gondolier's face, who was standing behind him, a little elevated, in front of the pale sky. It was a man of unpleasing, even violent physiognomy, dressed in blue sailor's garb, girded with a yellow sash and with a shapeless straw hat that had begun to dissolve at its edges slanted on his head. The form of his face, his blond and curly moustache below the stubby nose did not make him look very Italian. Although of relatively slender build, so that he did not seem particularly suited to his trade, he showed great energy when he used his whole body to drive the oar at every beat. A few times the exertion caused him to withdraw his lips and expose his white teeth. With his gaze fixed above the guest and his reddish eyebrows wrinkled he replied in a determined, almost harsh tone:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 \"You are going to the Lido.\"\n\nAschenbach replied:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\"Indeed. But I only wanted the gondola to take me to St Mark's \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Square.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I wish to go with the vaporetto.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\"You cannot go with the vaporetto, sir.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\"And why not?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\"Because the vaporetto does not transport luggage.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That was correct; Aschenbach remembered. He was silent. But the brusque, boastful, uncharacteristic behavior of that man seemed intolerable. He said: He remained taciturn. The oar was lapping, the water clashed dully against the bow. And the talking and murmuring resumed: the gondolier was speaking to himself between his teeth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What had to be done? Alone on the water with the strangely disobedient, unsettlingly determined man the traveler did not see a way to force upon him his will. And how softly he could be seated if he did not protest. Had he not wished that the trip should take longer, or forever? It was most prudent to let things take their course, and besides it was most comfortable. A spell of torpidity seemed to emanate from that low and black seat, so tenderly rocked by the oar beats of the defiant gondolier in his back. The notion of having fallen into the hands of a rogue streaked dreamlike through Aschenbach's mind \u2014 unable to summon his senses for active defense. Less appetizing was the possibility that this was just an act of extortion. A certain feeling of duty, the realization that one had to guard against such a thing, allowed him to make another effort. He asked:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\"How much do you want for the fare?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And looking above him the gondolier responded:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\"You will pay.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was clear what had to be replied to this. Aschenbach said \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mechanically:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\"I will pay you nothing, nothing at all if you take me somewhere \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not want to go.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\"You want to go to the Lido.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\"But not with you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\"I row you well.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That much is true, thought Aschenbach and relaxed again. It is true, you are rowing me well. Even if you are trying to get my money and would kill me with a quick blow of the oar, you would have rowed me well. But nothing of the sort happened. Even some company appeared, a boat with musical mendicants, men and women, singing to the accompaniment of guitars and mandolins, coming obtrusively close to the gondola, filling the quietude above the waters with their mercenary tunes. Aschenbach threw a few coins into the hat that was presented. They fell silent and rowed away. And the murmuring of the gondolier was perceptible\nonce more.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so one arrived, rocked by the backwash of a steamer headed for the city. Two municipal officers, hands clasped behind their backs, their heads facing the lagoon, were walking back and forth at the shore. Aschenbach got off the gondola at the pier, with help from the old man with his grappling hook who seems to be present on all Venetian landings; and because he did not have enough coins he entered the hotel which was situated across from the landing, to exchange some money and reward the gondolier as he pleased. He is served in the lobby, he returns, find his luggage on a cart at the quay, and the gondola and gondolier have disappeared.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\"He has taken off,\" said the old man with the grappling hook. \"A very bad man, a man without a license, dear sir. He is the only gondolier without a license. The others have telephoned here. He saw that he was being expected. So he took off.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aschenbach shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\"The sir has had a free ride,\" said the old man and presented his hat. Aschenbach threw in some coins. He gave orders to take his luggage to the Hotel des Bains and followed the cart through the alleyway, that white-blossoming alley, which, bordered by taverns, bazaars, and bed and breakfasts, runs across the island to the beach.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He entered the sprawling hotel from the rear, from the garden terrace and went through the lobby to the office. Because he had been announced, he was greeted with servile complicity. A manager, a diminutive, soft-spoken, ingratiatingly courteous man with a black moustache and a frock coat in the French style, accompanied him in the elevator to the third floor and showed him his room, a pleasant room with cherry furniture, decorated with heavily fragrant flowers and which had tall windows affording a view of the sea. He stepped close to one of them, after the manager had taken his leave, and while behind him his luggage was carried in, he surveyed the beach which lay deserted in the afternoon and the sunless sea at high tide sending its crouched and elongated waves in a steady rhythm against the shore.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The observations and encounters of the solitary and mute one are at the same time more blurry and more distinctive than those of the more sociable person, his thoughts more substantial, stranger, and never without a trace of sadness. Images and perceptions that would be easy to dismiss with a laugh, a short exchange of words, occupy him excessively and grow deeper and more important in silence, become experience, adventure, emotion. Solitude favors the original, the daringly and otherworldly beautiful, the poem. But it also favors the wrongful, the extreme, the absurd, and the forbidden. \u2014 Thus the unusual incidences on the journey were still disconcerting to the traveler, the horrible old man with his blabbering about a sweetheart, the gondolier who had not received payment. Without obstructing reason or giving any real food for thought, they were still extremely bizarre and possibly so bewildering because of that contradiction. In between he greeted the sea with his eyes and delighted in the knowledge that Venice could be so quickly and easily reached. Finally he turned, washed his face, gave some orders to the chambermaid to improve his comfort and had the green-liveried Swiss elevator attendant take him to the ground floor.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He took his tea on the seaside terrace, then descended and walked a good distance along the shore in the direction of the Hotel Excelsior. Upon his return it appeared to be time to dress for dinner. He did that slowly and with diligence, yet found himself still too early in the dining hall, where a group of hotel guests, un-known to each other and in feigned disinterest, had congregated in the expectation of a meal. He picked up a paper, seated himself in a club chair and contemplated the company which differed in a most agreeable way from that during his earlier stay on the island.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A wide and all-encompassing horizon opened itself out. Muffled sounds from many different languages were mixing. The omnipresent dinner jacket, the uniform of the civilized world, gathered all facets of human variety into one orderly whole. One saw the dry and elongated face of the American, the large Russian family, English ladies, German children with French nannies. The Slavic component appeared to predominate. Polish was spoken right next to him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a group of adolescents and bare adults, under the supervision of a governess around a small table: three young girls, perhaps between fifteen and seventeen, and a long-haired boy of about fourteen years. With astonishment Aschenbach noticed that the boy was perfectly beautiful. His countenance \u2014 pale and gracefully reserved, surrounded by honey-colored locks, with its evenly sloped nose, the lovely mouth, the expression of alluring and divine earnestness, was reminiscent of Greek statues from the most noble period, and with all its perfection of form it had such a personal appeal that the onlooker thought he had never encountered anything similar either in nature or in art. What else was striking was an apparently deliberate contrast between the educational guidelines after which the children were dressed and kept in general. The exterior of the girls, the oldest of which could be taken for an adult, was tart and chaste to the point of disfigurement. A uniform monastic garb, shale-toned, of average length, sober and consciously unbecoming, with white collars as the only bright spot, suppressed and made impossible any pleasingness of figure. The smooth hair that appeared to be glued to the head gave their faces a featurelessness and nunlike lack of expression. It seemed certain this was the work of a mother, and naturally it did not occur to her to apply that same paedagogic severity that pertained to the girls to the boy also. Mellowness and affection visibly ruled his existence. One had abstained from cutting his arresting hair; like the statue of the Boy with Thorn it curled onto the forehead, over the ears, and even more so in the nape. An English sailor suit, the voluminous sleeves of which were tapered towards the ends and which surrounded the delicate joints of his still childlike and narrow hands, contributed, with its strings, bows, and embroideries, an air of wealth and fastidiousness. He was sitting, in semiprofile from Aschenbach's point of view, one foot in front of the other, with an elbow leaning on the armrest of his basket chair, his cheek comforted by his closed hand, in an attitude of relaxed decorum and completely without the submissive stiffness that his sisters seemed to be used to. Was he sick? Because the white of his skin contrasted like ivory with the golden somberness of the adjacent curls. Or was he simply a coddled favorite child, carried by partial and capricious devotion? Aschenbach was inclined to believe that. Almost every artistic individual has a luxurious and treacherous propensity to recognize beauty- creating inequity and to render homage to aristocratic entitlement.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A waiter went around and announced the readiness of the meal in English. Slowly the society disappeared through the glass door into the dining room. Latecomers passed by, arriving from the vestibule or the elevator. Inside the serving had begun, but the young Poles remained seated around the little tables and Aschenbach, sitting snugly in his chair, not to mention having a favorable view of something beautiful, lingered along with them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The governess, a stocky dame with a reddish face, finally gave the signal to rise. With lifted eyebrows she shoved back her chair and bowed, when a tall lady, dressed in white and gray and richly attired with pearls, entered the room. She comported herself with coolness and restraint, the arrangement of her lightly powdered hair and the style of her dress were of that simplicity which always rules good taste where devoutness is considered an element of noblesse. She could have been the wife of a high-ranking German official. Something extravagant only entered her appearance through her jewelry, which seemed extremely expensive and consisted of earrings and a triple, very long necklace of cherry-sized, mildly shimmering pearls.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The children had arisen promptly. They kissed their mother's hand, who looked above their heads with an aloof smile of her well-groomed but slightly tired and sharp-nosed face and addressed a few words in French to the governess. Then she proceeded towards the glass door. The children followed her: the girls ordered by age, then the governess, and finally the boy. For some unknown reason he turned around before crossing the threshold and since nobody else was present, his curiously dark-gray eyes met those of Aschenbach, who, with the newspaper on his lap and deep in his thoughts, had traced the group.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What he had seen was certainly not remarkable in its details. One had not gone to table before the mother, one had waited for her, greeted her and observed the usual customs on entering the dining room. But somehow all that was presented with such a deliberate accentuation of manners, commitment, and self-respect that Aschenbach felt strangely moved by it. He hesitated for a few moments and then also went into the dining room and had himself seated, unfortunately quite far from the Polish family as he observed with regret.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exhausted and yet in mental commotion, he entertained himself with abstract, even transcendental subjects during dinner, mulled the mysterious link between the orderly and the individual for human beauty to appear, departed from there to think about the general problems of form and art and eventually found his thoughts and findings to resemble certain apparently fortuitous ideas in a dream, that on closer inspection reveal themselves to be completely stale and unworkable. After the meal he went into the park that was filled with evening smells and smoked, sometimes sitting, sometimes walking, then he went to bed even though it was still early and spent the night in sleep that was consistently deep, but enlivened by dreams of the most varied kinds.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The weather had not improved on the next day. A land breeze was stirring. Under a pale and overcast sky the sea lay in dull quietness, shrunken so to say, with a soberingly clear horizon and so far removed from the beach than it exposed several large sandbanks. When Aschenbach opened his window, he believed to sense the putrid smell of the lagoon.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discontent befell him. Already he considered departing. Once, a few years ago, this kind of weather had, after two sunny spring weeks, struck him and had impacted his mood in such a way that he had had to flee from Venice. Did not again that febrile listlessness, that pressure in the temples, that heaviness of the eyelids make themselves known? Moving to a new lodging for another time would be tiresome; but if the wind did not change direction, he would not stay. Just in case he did not fully unpack his luggage. At nine o'clock he ate breakfast in the special room that was reserved for that use, between the lobby and the dining room.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the buffet room that ceremonial silence reigned that is part of the ambition of every great hotel. The waiters tiptoed around while serving. A clattering of the tea service, a half-whispered word was all that could be heard. In a corner, diagonally across from the door and two tables apart from him, Aschenbach noticed the Polish girls with their governess. Very upright, the ash blond hair newly flattened and with red eyes, in stiff dresses made of blue linen with little white collars and cuffs they sat there and handed each other the jam. They had almost finished their breakfast. The boy was absent.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aschenbach smiled to himself. \"So, my little Phaeacian!\" he thought. \"You seem to possess the privilege of sleeping in.\" And suddenly merry he recited the line from a poem below his breath:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Jewelry, a hot bath, and rest have often made a difference.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He ate without hurry, received some letters from the porter, who had come to the room with his cap taken off, and opened a few of them while smoking a cigarette. So it happened that he still witnessed the entrance of the long sleeper who was already expected at the other table.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He came in through the glass door and ambled through the silence diagonally across the room to his sisters' table. His walk was very graceful, both in his stance and in the movement of the knees, the way his feet touched the ground, very light, at the same time tender and proud and made more appealing through the childlike self-consciousness with which he looked up and down two times while crossing the room. Smiling, with a soft word in his fuzzy-sounding language he took his place, and now that he presented the onlooker with his full profile, Aschenbach was taken by surprise again, even frightened by the godlike beauty of that human child. That day the lad was wearing a light suit of blue and white fabric with a bow of red silk on his breast and a simple white collar. Above that collar, which did not even fit the rest of the suit very elegantly, the flower of his crown rested with unequaled charm \u2014 the head of Eros, with the yellowish tint of Parisian marble, with exquisite and somber brows, temples and ear covered by the dark and soft curls of his hair.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well, well, thought Aschenbach with that cool approval of the specialist, with which artists at times cloak their transports of delight in the face of a masterwork. And further he thought: Truly, are not the sea and the beach waiting for me, I will remain here as long as you! So he went across the hall, greeted by the waiters, along the great terrace and straight over the boardwalk to the private beach reserved for hotel guests. He let the barefoot old man, who was, in his linen pants, sailor's blouse, and straw hat, working as a bath attendant there, show him his little beach hut, had a chair and table taken from inside and put in front of it on the wooden platform and made himself comfortable in the deck chair, which he had put up a bit closer to the sea in the wax-yellow sand.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scene at the beach, that picture of carefree and sensual enjoyment next to the sea, entertained and delighted him as always. The gray and even ocean was enlivened by wading children, swimmers, garish figures, others, who were laying on sandbanks with their arms folded under their heads. Some were rowing small boats in red and blue without a keel, capsizing with roaring laughter. In front of the row of beach huts, whose platforms were like little verandas, there was playful motion and lazy rest, visits and chattering, careful early morning elegance but also nudity, which pertly took pleasure in the freedom of the place. Closer to the sea, lone figures were strolling on the moist and firm sand in white dressing gowns or in voluminous, colorful garb. An intricate sand castle to Aschenbach's right, built by children, was sporting all around tiny flags of many different countries. Vendors of mussels, pies, and fruit were on their knees spreading out their goods. On the left, in front of a hut that stood at a right angle to the other ones and was the endpoint of the beach on that side, a Russian family was camping: men with beards and large teeth, mellow and idle women, a Baltic damsel, who was sitting in front of an easel and was painting the sea with intermittent cries of despair, two benevolent and ugly children, an old maidservant with a kerchief and tenderly servile slave manners. In grateful appreciation they were living there, always calling out the names of the unruly youngsters, jesting for a long time with the old man thanks to a few words of Italian, buying sweets, kissing each other on the cheeks, and generally not caring about any onlookers.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So I will stay, Aschenbach thought. Where could it be better? And with his hands folded in his lap he allowed his eyes to wander in the vastness of the sea, his gaze slipping, becoming blurred, and breaking in the monotonous mist of nothingness. He loved the ocean for important reasons: out of the desire for tranquility harbored by the hard-working artist, who seeks to conceal himself from the multitude of possibilities by embracing the simple and immense; out of a forbidden proclivity for the unordered, the immeasurable, the eternal, the void that was made even more attractive by running counter to his work. To find peace in the presence of the faultless is the desire of the one who seeks excellence; and is not nothingness a form of perfection? While he was dreaming into the deepness of space, he suddenly became aware of a human figure close to the shoreline and when he collected his glance from the unlimited, it turned out to be the beautiful boy, who, coming from the left, was crossing the sand before him. He was barefoot, ready for wading, his slender legs bared till above the knees, advancing slowly, but so nimbly and proudly as if he was used to walking without footwear and he surveyed the huts. No sooner had he noticed the peaceful Russian family than his face was clouded by a tempest of scorn and disdain. His brow darkened, his mouth was lifted, between the lips and the cheeks an embittered tearing took place, and his eyebrows were so heavily wrinkled that they made the eyes appear sunken in and let them speak the evil and somber language of hatred. He averted his glance, beheld them another time, made a fiercely dismissive gesture with his shoulder and turned his back unto the enemy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A sort of tenderness or terror, something like shame or respect caused Asch-enbach to turn away as if he had seen nothing; because the serious observer of a casual passion refuses to admit his impressions even to himself. But he was delighted and shocked at the same time: that is, elated. This childish fanaticism which was directed at the most benign slab of life \u2014 it made the divinely vacant a part of the human order; it made nature's precious work of art, that had only been fit to be an eyeful, seem worthy of a deeper sympathy; and it gave the already striking personage of the youth a historico-political backdrop that allowed him to be taken seriously in spite of his age.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still turned away, Aschenbach listened to the boy's speech, his high-pitched and somewhat feeble voice, with which he tried to announce himself to his comrades playing at the sand castle. The replies consisted in calling him by his real name or a pet name and Aschenbach paid interested attention, without being able to hear them perfectly, to two melodic syllables like \"Adgio\" or more frequently \"Adgiu\" with a vocatively-stretched \"oo\" sound at the end. He delighted in the tone of it, he found its pleasantness befitting the thing it described, repeated it below his breath and contently moved on to his letters and other paperwork.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His little writing case on his lap, he began to pen assorted correspondence. But after about a quarter of an hour had passed, it occurred to him how unfortunate it was to let this situation, the most delightful he had known, pass by like that. He moved aside his writing utensils, returned to the sea, and after a short while, seated on his deck chair and distracted by the voices of the children who were working on the sand castle, he turned his head to the right to further investigate the comings and goings of the marvelous Adgio.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His glance immediately discovered him; the red bow on his breast was difficult to miss. Occupied with the others in furnishing an old plank as a drawbridge for the sand castle, he gave loud orders for that endeavor, emphasizing his commands with movements of his head. With him there were about ten comrades in all, boys and girls, some of his age and some younger, speaking in Polish, French, and languages of the Balkans. But it was his name that was heard most often. Obviously he was popular, courted, admired. One of them, a stocky lad who was called \"Jaschu,\" with black, slicked-back hair and in a linen suit, appeared to be his closest servant and confidant. When the daily work on the sand edifice had finished, they ambled along the beach in each other's arms, and the one called \"Jaschu\" placed a kiss on the beautiful Adgio's cheek.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aschenbach was tempted to make a threatening gesture with the finger to Jaschu. \"I advise you, Critobulus,\" he thought smilingly, \"to leave for a year! Because it will take as much time for you to recover.\" And then he went on to eat a breakfast of very large and ripe strawberries which he had obtained from a vendor. It had gotten very hot, although the Sun had been unable to penetrate the layer of haze in the sky. Lassitude immobilized the mind, while the senses were taking pleasure in the immense and deadening spectacle of the silent sea. To divine, to explore which name it might be that sounded a bit like \"Adgio\" was considered by the earnest man a fitting and absolutely filling task and occupation. With the help of some Polish remembrances he decided that it had to be \"Tadzio,\" short for \"Tadeusz\" and \"Tadziu\" in the vocative. Tadzio was bathing. Aschenbach, who had lost him from his sight, found his head, his arm, with which he made rowing motions, far away out on the sea; because it was quite shallow for a great distance. But immediately there was concern about him, female voices were calling out for him from the huts, exclaiming again that word which was like a password at the beach and that, with its soft sound and its drawn out \"oo\" sound at the end, had something both sweet and wild about it: \"Tadziu, Tadziu!\" He obeyed, he ran through the flood, causing the water to foam with his legs, his head tilted backwards; and to witness how the lively figure, pretty and harsh in a not-yet-manly way, with dripping curls and handsome like a youthful god, ascended from the watery depths of sky and sea: That sight induced mythical connotations, he was like a poem about ancient times, the birth of form and the genesis of the gods. Aschenbach intently listened to that song that came from inside; and again he thought that it was good to be here and that he wanted to stay.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Later Tadzio lay, exhausted from his bathing, on the sand, wrapped in white linen which was tucked under the right shoulder, resting with his head on his bare arm; and even when Aschenbach was not looking at him but read a few pages in his book, he almost never forgot the recumbent and that he only had to turn his head slightly to the right to catch sight of the admirable. It almost seemed to him as if he was guarding the resting boy \u2014 occupied with his own things and yet with unwavering vigilance for that supreme specimen to his right, not far from him. And a fatherly awe, the complete devotion of the one who tries to create beauty to the one who is endowed with it filled and moved his heart.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At noon he departed from the beach, returned to the hotel, and took the elevator to his room. Inside he spent some time in front of the mirror and studied his gray hair, his weary and sharply-cut face. In that moment he thought of his fame, and how many people looked up to him for his ability to always find the right words and graceful phrases \u2014 he called to witness all the successes his gifts had given him that he could think of and even considered his knighthood. Then he went down to the dining room and took a meal at his little table. When he entered the elevator afterwards, young people jostled into that tiny hovering cubbyhole, who were also coming from breakfast, and Tadzio joined them. He stood very close to Aschenbach, for the first time close enough that Aschenbach was afforded a more intimate look with all details. Someone addressed the lad, and while he replied with an unimaginably lovely smile, he already stepped out at the second floor, walking backwards, with downcast eyes. Beauty makes one shy, thought Aschenbach and mulled why this would be the case. He had in fact noticed that Tadzio's teeth were not quite as pleasant; slightly jagged and pale, without the sheen of health and of a strangely translucent quality as in someone with anemia. He is a bit frail, he is sickly, thought Aschenbach. He will probably not live very long. And he declined to account for the feeling of satisfaction and calmness that accompanied that notion.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He spent two hours in his room and took the vaporetto across the foul-smelling lagoon to Venice in the afternoon. He got out at St Mark's Square, took his tea there and then commenced a walk through the city, according to his local schedule. But it was this walk which caused a total reversal in his mood and his decisions.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A revolting sultriness could be felt in the alleys, the air was so heavy that the odors that emanated from the apartments, stores, and cookshops, like those of hot oil, clouds of perfume and many more, remained fixed like clouds without dispersing. Cigarette smoke hung in one place and only gradually escaped. The jostle in the narrow streets was a burden, not an enjoyment to the stroller. The longer he walked, the more that disgusting condition took hold over him which is effected by the sea breeze and the scirocco and which is excitement and fatigue at the same time. He began to sweat unpleasantly. The eyes ceased to function, his chest felt tight, he was febrile, his pulse was pounding in his head. He fled from the business district to the quarters of the poor: there mendicants pursued him and the fetid stench from the canals made breathing even more difficult. In a quiet spot, one of those forgotten fairy tale places that can be found in the heart of Venice, resting next to a well, he dabbed dry his forehead and came to realize that he had to go somewhere else.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the second time and permanently the city had proven to be very harmful to him in that kind of weather. Stubborn holding out seemed unreasonable, the probability of the wind changing direction was unknown. A quick decision had to be made. To return home already was not an option. Neither his summer nor winter quarters were ready for his arrival. But not only in Venice there were the sea and the beach, and in other places they could be found without the evil ingredients of the lagoon and its febrile effusion. He recalled a small seaside resort not far from Trieste, which had been praised. Why not go there? And that immediately, so that this change of location would still be worthwhile. He affirmed his decision and arose. At the next gondola landing he took a vehicle to convey him, through the dull labyrinth of the canals, below delicate marble balconies surrounded by lion sculptures, around slippery corners, along sorrowful palace facades with large company signs, which were mirrored in the garbage-topped water, to St Mark's. He had trouble getting there because the gondolier, who received payment from lace and glass manufacturers, tried to get him to do sightseeing and shopping and when the bizarre trip through Venice began to cast its spell, the mercenary spirit of the sunken queen contributed to an unpleasant sobering of the senses.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Back in the hotel he let the clerks in the office know that unforeseen circumstances required him to leave the very next morning. This was found regrettable, his bill was prepared. He had dinner and spent the balmy evening reading journals on the rear terrace. Before going to sleep he completely prepared his trunk for the next day.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He did not sleep very well as he was concerned about the impending departure. When he opened the window on the next morning the sky was still overcast but the air seemed refreshed, and \u2014 now his remorse began. Was this cancellation not hasty and in error, the conduct of an ill and unimportant state? Had he waited just a little more, had he made one more try to adapt to the Venetian atmosphere or considered the possibility that the weather might improve, then he could experience now, instead of haste and waste, a morning at the beach just like the day before. Too late. Now he had to continue wanting what he had wanted before. He got dressed and went down for breakfast at eight o'clock.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The buffet room was still deserted when he entered. Solitary figures appeared while he was waiting for what he had ordered. With the tea cup at his lips, he saw the Polish girls with their governess come into the room; austere and full of morning freshness, but with red eyes they paraded to their table in the corner. In the very next moment the porter approached and reminded him it was time to go. The car was waiting to transport him and other travelers to the Hotel \"Excelsior\" from where the motor launch would carry everyone through a private canal to the station. Time was pressing. \u2014 Aschenbach replied that time did not press at all. More than an hour remained until his train left. He did not like the habit of hotels to kick out their guests before their time and told the porter to let him finish his breakfast in peace. The man retreated hesitantly, only to reappear five minutes later. The car could wait no longer. Then he should drive away and take his luggage with him, Aschenbach responded angrily. He himself would, in due time, use the public steamer and would take care of his departure himself. The employee bowed. Aschenbach, relieved to have diverted the unwelcome exhortations, finished his meal unhurriedly, and even had the waiter bring him the daily newspaper. Time had grown quite short when he arose. It just so happened that Tadzio crossed\nthe threshold that very moment.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Walking towards the table of his family, he crossed paths with Aschenbach, cast down his glance before the gray-haired man, only to look at him softly in his lovely way and passed. \"Adieu, Tadzio!\" thought Aschenbach. \"It was all too brief.\" And as he, contrary to his usual habit, formed the words with his lips, he added: \"God bless you!\" \u2014 Next he organized his departure, gave tips, was bid farewell by the little soft-spoken manager in the French frock coat and left the hotel on foot as he had arrived to take the white-blossoming alley across the island to the steamship landing, followed by the manservant carrying his hand luggage. He reaches it, he takes a seat \u2014 and what followed was an odyssey through all shades of regret.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was the familiar trip across the lagoon, passing St Mark's, up the Grand Canal. Aschenbach was seated on the circular bench at the bow, leaning with his arm upon the handrail, shading his eyes from the Sun. The municipal gardens retreated, the piazzetta opened out once more in princely charm and was left behind, next came the great row of palaces, and behind the bend of the waterway the magnificent arch of the Rialto Bridge appeared. The departing looked on, and his heart was torn. The atmosphere of the city, that slightly putrid smell which he had so sought to escape from \u2014 he breathed it now in deep, tenderly painful breaths. Was it possible that he did not know or had not taken into account how much he was attached to all of this? What had been a half-regretful, tiny doubt about the Tightness of his decision now became a real pain, a desperation of the soul, so bitter that it brought tears to his eyes and of which he said to himself that he could not have foreseen it. What seemed to him so hard to bear, even intolerable, was apparently the notion that he would never again set eyes on Venice, that this would be a permanent farewell. Since it had been proven a second time that the city made him sick, as he had to leave it in a hurry again, he would have to consider it an impossible and forbidden place that was too much for him and where it made no sense to go back to. He even felt that, if he departed now, shame and defiance would keep him from ever seeing the city again, the demands of which on his body he had been unable to meet twice; and this discrepancy between his desire and physical potency suddenly appeared so grave and important to the senescent, the corporeal defeat so unacceptable and the need to prevent it at all costs so imperative, that he could not understand how he could have given in so easily and without a fight.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime the steamer approached the station and pain and perplexity increased until a state of confusion was reached. Departure seems impossible to the tormented soul, but so does staying. Absolutely torn that way he enters the station. It is already rather late, he has no time to lose if he wants to catch his train. He wants it and he wants it not. But time presses, it pushes him forward; he hastens to get his ticket and searches the jostle of the hall for the local officer of the hotel company. The man is found and reports that the large trunk has already been shipped. Already shipped? Yes, exactly \u2014 to Como. To Como? And after some heated discussion of irate questions and sheepish replies it emerges that the trunk, together with some other luggage, had been sent from the Hotel \"Excelsior\" into the completely wrong direction.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aschenbach found it difficult to keep the expected expression on his face. An adventurous joy and unbelievable happiness moved him almost as in a fit. The employee ran off to possibly still hold the trunk back, but as surmised he returned unsuccessfully. So Aschenbach declared that he would not leave without his trunk but instead wanted to return to the Hotel des Bains to wait for it there. Was the motor launch of the society still at the station? The man affirmed that it was still there. He ordered the ticket clerk to take back the ticket, he swore to telegraph and that no expense would be spared to get back the trunk as soon as possible, and \u2014 so the odd thing took place that the traveler, twenty minutes after his arrival at the station, found himself again on the Grand Canal on his way back to the Lido.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wondrously improbable, embarrassing, comically dreamlike experience: To see those places again within the hour from which one had tearfully departed forever, thanks to twists of fate! Foaming at the bow, maneuvering with dexterity between the gondolas and steamers, the fast little vehicle bolted towards its destination, while its passenger, under a mask of enraged resignation, hid the fearfully wanton attitude of a runaway boy. From time to time he was still moved to laughter about his misfortune that could not have been more timely. Explanations had to be given, surprised expressions had to be braved \u2014 and then all was well again, he said to himself, an accident had been prevented, a grave error corrected and everything he had believed to have left behind could be his again for as long as he desired. . . Did the speedy ride fool him or had the wind indeed turned and was now blowing from the sea?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The waves lapped against the concrete walls of the narrow canal, which leads across the island to the Hotel \"Excelsior\". A horseless omnibus was expecting the returning one and transported him on a road far above the undulating sea back to the Hotel des Bains. The little moustached manager came down the stairs to greet him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Softly ingratiating he regretted the incident, called it very embarrassing for the hotel, but fully supported Aschenbach's decision to await the trunk here. Of course his room was already occupied, but a different one, no worse, would be available. u Pas de chance, monsieur\" said the Swiss elevator operator with a smile as they went up. And so the refugee took quarters again, in a room that was almost identical to first one in terms of the view and furnishings.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Weary and deadened from the chaos of that strange morning, he distributed the contents of his hand luggage in the room and sat down in an armchair next to the open window. The ocean had taken on a pale green color, the air seemed thinner and more pure, the beach with its boats and huts more colorful, even though the sky was still gray. Aschenbach looked outside, his hands folded in his lap, content to be back, shaking his head about his fickleness, his lack of knowledge about his own desires. So he sat maybe for an hour, resting and lost in mindless reverie. At noon he spotted Tadzio who, in a striped linen suit with a red bow, returned to the hotel via the wooden path. Aschenbach immediately recognized him, before he had even really looked at him, and wanted to think of something like: \"Look, Tadzio, there you are again!\" But in the same moment he felt the casual greeting sink and become silent in the face of the truth of his heart \u2014 felt the excitement of his blood, the joy and pain in his soul and realized that the farewell had been so taxing because of Tadzio.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He sat in utter silence, entirely unobserved on his high vantage point and looked inside of himself. The expression on his face had become enlivened, his eyebrows were moving up, an attentive, curious, and witty smile tensed his mouth. Then he raised his head and made with his arms, which had been hanging limply over the armrests of the chair, a slowly circular and raising motion, palms turned forward, as if suggesting an opening and extending of the arms.

There were periods when she took delight in perfect vacancy of hand and eye\u2014moments when her thoughts, her simple existence, the fact of the world being around and heaven above her, seemed to yield her such fullness of happiness that she did not need to lift a finger to increase the joy. Often, after an active morning, she would spend a sunny afternoon in lying stirless on the turf, at the foot of some tree of friendly umbrage. No society did she need but that of Caroline, and it sufficed if she were within call; no spectacle did she ask but that of the deep blue sky, and such cloudlets as sailed afar and aloft across its span; no sound but that of the bee's hum, the leaf's whisper. Her sole book in such hours was the dim chronicle of memory or the sibyl page of anticipation. From her young eyes fell on each volume a glorious light to read by; round her lips at moments played a smile which revealed glimpses of the tale or prophecy. It was not sad, not dark. Fate had been benign to the blissful dreamer, and promised to favour her yet again. In her past were sweet passages, in her future rosy hopes.\n\nYet one day when Caroline drew near to rouse her, thinking she had lain long enough, behold, as she looked down, Shirley's cheek was wet as if with dew; those fine eyes of hers shone humid and brimming.\n\n\"Shirley, why do you cry?\" asked Caroline, involuntarily laying stress on you.\n\nMiss Keeldar smiled, and turned her picturesque head towards the questioner. \"Because it pleases me mightily to cry,\" she said. \"My heart is both sad and glad. But why, you good, patient child\u2014why do you not bear me company? I only weep tears, delightful and soon wiped away; you might weep gall, if you choose.\"\n\n\"Why should I weep gall?\"\n\"Mateless, solitary bird!\" was the only answer.\n\n\"And are not you too mateless, Shirley?\"\n\n\"At heart\u2014no.\"\n\n\"Oh! who nestles there, Shirley?\"\n\nBut Shirley only laughed gaily at this question, and alertly started up.\n\n\"I have dreamed,\" she said, \"a mere day-dream\u2014certainly bright, probably baseless!\"\n\nMiss Helstone was by this time free enough from illusions: she took a sufficiently grave view of the future, and fancied she knew pretty well how her own destiny and that of some others were tending. Yet old associations retained their influence over her, and it was these and the power of habit which still frequently drew her of an evening to the field-style and the old thorn overlooking the Hollow.\n\nOne night, the night after the incident of the note, she had been at her usual post, watching for her beacon\u2014watching vainly: that evening no lamp was lit. She waited till the rising of certain constellations warned her of lateness and signed her away. In passing Fieldhead, on her return, its moonlight beauty attracted her glance, and stayed her step an instant. Tree and hall rose peaceful under the night sky and clear full orb; pearly paleness gilded the building; mellow brown gloom bosomed it round; shadows of deep green brooded above its oak-wreathed roof. The broad pavement in front shone pale also; it gleamed as if some spell had transformed the dark granite to glistering Parian. On the silvery space slept two sable shadows, thrown sharply defined from two human figures. These figures when first seen were motionless and mute; presently they moved in harmonious step, and spoke low in harmonious key. Earnest was the gaze that scrutinized them as they emerged from behind the trunk of the cedar. \"Is it Mrs. Pryor and Shirley?\"\n\nCertainly it is Shirley. Who else has a shape so lithe, and proud, and graceful? And her face, too, is visible\u2014her countenance careless and pensive, and musing and mirthful, and mocking and tender. Not fearing the dew, she has not covered her head; her curls are free\u2014they veil her neck and caress her shoulder with their tendril rings. An ornament of gold gleams through the half-closed folds of the scarf she has wrapped across her bust, and a large bright gem glitters on the white hand which confines it. Yes, that is Shirley.\n\nHer companion then is, of course, Mrs. Pryor?\n\nYes, if Mrs. Pryor owns six feet of stature, and if she has changed her decent widow's weeds for masculine disguise. The figure walking at Miss Keeldar's side is a man\u2014a tall, young, stately man; it is her tenant, Robert Moore.\n\nThe pair speak softly; their words are not distinguishable. To remain a moment to gaze is not to be an eavesdropper; and as the moon shines so clearly and their countenances are so distinctly apparent, who can resist the attraction of such interest? Caroline, it seems, cannot, for she lingers.\n\nThere was a time when, on summer nights, Moore had been wont to walk with his cousin, as he was now walking with the heiress. Often had she gone up the Hollow with him after sunset, to scent the freshness of the earth, where a growth of fragrant herbage carpeted a certain narrow terrace, edging a deep ravine, from whose rifted gloom was heard a sound like the spirit of the lonely watercourse, moaning amongst its wet stones, and between its weedy banks, and under its dark bower of alders.\n\"But I used to be closer to him,\" thought Caroline. \"He felt no obligation to treat me with homage; I needed only kindness. He used to hold my hand; he does not touch hers. And yet Shirley is not proud where she loves. There is no haughtiness in her aspect now, only a little in her port\u2014what is natural to and inseparable from her, what she retains in her most careless as in her most guarded moments. Robert must think, as I think, that he is at this instant looking down on a fine face; and he must think it with a man's brain, not with mine. She has such generous yet soft fire in her eyes. She smiles\u2014what makes her smile so sweet? I saw that Robert felt its beauty, and he must have felt it with his man's heart, not with my dim woman's perceptions. They look to me like two great happy spirits. Yonder silvered pavement reminds me of that white shore we believe to be beyond the death-flood. They have reached it; they walk there united. And what am I, standing here in shadow, shrinking into concealment, my mind darker than my hiding-place? I am one of this world, no spirit\u2014a poor doomed mortal, who asks, in ignorance and hopelessness, wherefore she was born, to what end she lives; whose mind for ever runs on the question, how she shall at last encounter, and by whom be sustained through death.\n\n\"This is the worst passage I have come to yet; still I was quite prepared for it. I gave Robert up, and gave him up to Shirley, the first day I heard she was come, the first moment I saw her\u2014rich, youthful, and lovely. She has him now. He is her lover. She is his darling. She will be far more his darling yet when they are married. The more Robert knows of Shirley the more his soul will cleave to her. They will both be happy, and I do not grudge them their bliss; but I groan under my own misery. Some of my suffering is very acute. Truly I ought not to have been born; they should have smothered me at the first cry.\"\n\nHere, Shirley stepping aside to gather a dewy flower, she and her companion turned into a path that lay nearer the gate. Some of their conversation became audible. Caroline would not stay to listen. She passed away noiselessly, and the moonlight kissed the wall which her shadow had dimmed. The reader is privileged to remain, and try what he can make of the discourse.\n\n\"I cannot conceive why nature did not give you a bulldog's head, for you have all a bulldog's tenacity,\" said Shirley.\n\n\"Not a flattering idea. Am I so ignoble?\"\n\n\"And something also you have of the same animal's silent ways of going about its work. You give no warning; you come noiselessly behind, seize fast, and hold on.\"\n\n\"This is guess-work. You have witnessed no such feat on my part. In your presence I have been no bulldog.\"\n\n\"Your very silence indicates your race. How little you talk in general, yet how deeply you scheme! You are far-seeing; you are calculating.\"\n\n\"I know the ways of these people. I have gathered information of their intentions. My note last night informed you that Barraclough's trial had ended in his conviction and sentence to transportation. His associates will plot vengeance. I shall lay my plans so as to counteract or at least be prepared for theirs\u2014that is all. Having now given you as clear an explanation as I can, am I to understand that for what I propose doing I have your approbation?\"\n\n\"I shall stand by you so long as you remain on the defensive. Yes.\"\n\n\"Good! Without any aid\u2014even opposed or disapproved by you\u2014I believe I should have acted precisely as I now intend to act, but in another spirit. I now feel satisfied. On the whole, I relish the position.\"\n\n\"I dare say you do. That is evident. You relish the work which lies before you still better than you would relish the execution of a government order for army-cloth.\"\n\n\"I certainly feel it congenial.\"\n\"So would old Helstone. It is true there is a shade of difference in your motives\u2014many shades, perhaps. Shall I speak to Mr. Helstone? I will, if you like.\"\n\n\"Act as you please. Your judgment, Miss Keeldar, will guide you accurately. I could rely on it myself in a more difficult crisis. But I should inform you Mr. Helstone is somewhat prejudiced against me at present.\"\n\n\"I am aware\u2014I have heard all about your differences. Depend upon it, they will melt away. He cannot resist the temptation of an alliance under present circumstances.\"\n\n\"I should be glad to have him; he is of true metal.\"\n\n\"I think so also.\"\n\n\"An old blade, and rusty somewhat, but the edge and temper still excellent.\"\n\n\"Well, you shall have him, Mr. Moore\u2014that is, if I can win him.\"\n\n\"Whom can you not win?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not the rector; but I will make the effort.\"\n\n\"Effort! He will yield for a word\u2014a smile.\"\n\n\"By no means. It will cost me several cups of tea, some toast and cake, and an ample measure of remonstrances, expostulations, and persuasions. It grows rather chill.\"\n\n\"I perceive you shiver. Am I acting wrongly to detain you here? Yet it is so calm\u2014I even feel it warm\u2014and society such as yours is a pleasure to me so rare. If you were wrapped in a thicker shawl\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"I might stay longer, and forget how late it is, which would chagrin Mrs. Pryor. We keep early and regular hours at Fieldhead, Mr. Moore; and so, I am sure, does your sister at the cottage.\"\n\n\"Yes; but Hortense and I have an understanding the most convenient in the world, that we shall each do as we please.\"\n\n\"How do you please to do?\"\n\n\"Three nights in the week I sleep in the mill\u2014but I require little rest\u2014and when it is moonlight and mild I often haunt the Hollow till daybreak.\"\n\n\"When I was a very little girl, Mr. Moore, my nurse used to tell me tales of fairies being seen in that Hollow. That was before my father built the mill, when it was a perfectly solitary ravine. You will be falling under enchantment.\"\n\n\"I fear it is done,\" said Moore, in a low voice.\n\n\"But there are worse things than fairies to be guarded against,\" pursued Miss Keeldar.\n\n\"Things more perilous,\" he subjoined.\n\n\"Far more so. For instance, how would you like to meet Michael Hartley, that mad Calvinist and Jacobin weaver? They say he is addicted to poaching, and often goes abroad at night with his gun.\"\n\n\"I have already had the luck to meet him. We held a long argument together one night. A strange little incident it was; I liked it.\"\n\n\"Liked it? I admire your taste! Michael is not sane. Where did you meet him?\"\n\n\"In the deepest, shadiest spot in the glen, where the water runs low, under brushwood. We sat down near that plank bridge. It was moonlight, but clouded, and very windy. We had a talk.\"\n\n\"On politics?\"\n\n\"And religion. I think the moon was at the full, and Michael was as near crazed as possible. He uttered strange blasphemy in his Antinomian fashion.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, but I think you must have been nearly as mad as he, to sit listening to him.\"\n\n\"There is a wild interest in his ravings. The man would be half a poet, if he were not wholly a maniac; and perhaps a prophet, if he were not a profligate. He solemnly informed me that hell was foreordained my inevitable portion; that he read the mark of the beast on my brow; that I had been an outcast from the beginning. God's vengeance, he said, was preparing for me, and affirmed that in a vision of the night he had beheld the manner and the instrument of my doom. I wanted to know further, but he left me with these words, 'The end is not yet.'\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen him since?\"\n\n\"About a month afterwards, in returning from market, I encountered him and Moses Barraclough, both in an advanced stage of inebriation. They were praying in frantic sort at the roadside. They accosted me as Satan, bid me avaunt, and clamoured to be delivered from temptation. Again, but a few days ago, Michael took the trouble of appearing at the counting-house door, hatless, in his shirt-sleeves\u2014his coat and castor having been detained at the public-house in pledge. He delivered himself of the comfortable message that he could wish Mr. Moore to set his house in order, as his soul was likely shortly to be required of him.\"\n\n\"Do you make light of these things?\"\n\n\"The poor man had been drinking for weeks, and was in a state bordering on delirium tremens.\"\n\n\"What then? He is the more likely to attempt the fulfilment of his own prophecies.\"\n\n\"It would not do to permit incidents of this sort to affect one's nerves.\"\n\n\"Mr. Moore, go home!\"\n\n\"So soon?\"\n\n\"Pass straight down the fields, not round by the lade and plantations.\"\n\n\"It is early yet.\"\n\n\"It is late. For my part, I am going in. Will you promise me not to wander in the Hollow to-night?\"\n\n\"If you wish it.\"\n\n\"I do wish it. May I ask whether you consider life valueless?\"\n\n\"By no means. On the contrary, of late I regard my life as invaluable.\"\n\n\"Of late?\"\n\n\"Existence is neither aimless nor hopeless to me now, and it was both three months ago. I was then drowning, and rather wished the operation over. All at once a hand was stretched to me\u2014such a delicate hand I scarcely dared trust it; its strength, however, has rescued me from ruin.\"\n\n\"Are you really rescued?\"\n\n\"For the time. Your assistance has given me another chance.\"\n\n\"Live to make the best of it. Don't offer yourself as a target to Michael Hartley; and good-night!\"\n\nMiss Helstone was under a promise to spend the evening of the next day at Fieldhead. She kept her promise. Some gloomy hours had she spent in the interval. Most of the time had been passed shut up in her own apartment, only issuing from it, indeed, to join her uncle at meals, and anticipating inquiries from Fanny by telling her that she was busy altering a dress, and preferred sewing upstairs, to avoid interruption.\n\nShe did sew. She plied her needle continuously, ceaselessly, but her brain worked faster than her fingers. Again, and more intensely than ever, she desired a fixed occupation, no matter how onerous, how irksome. Her uncle must be once more entreated, but first she would consult Mrs. Pryor. Her head laboured to frame projects as diligently as her hands to plait and stitch the thin texture of the muslin summer dress spread on the little white couch at the foot of which she sat. Now and then, while thus doubly occupied, a tear would fill her eyes and fall on her busy hands; but this sign of emotion was rare and quickly effaced. The sharp pang passed; the dimness cleared from her vision. She would re-thread her needle, rearrange tuck and trimming, and work on.\n\nLate in the afternoon she dressed herself. She reached Fieldhead, and appeared in the oak parlour just as tea was brought in. Shirley asked her why she came so late.\n\n\"Because I have been making my dress,\" said she. \"These fine sunny days began to make me ashamed of my winter merino, so I have furbished up a lighter garment.\"\n\n\"In which you look as I like to see you,\" said Shirley. \"You are a lady-like little person, Caroline.\u2014Is she not, Mrs. Pryor?\"\n\nMrs. Pryor never paid compliments, and seldom indulged in remarks, favourable or otherwise, on personal appearance. On the present occasion she only swept Caroline's curls from her cheek as she took a seat near her, caressed the oval outline, and observed, \"You get somewhat thin, my love, and somewhat pale. Do you sleep well? your eyes have a languid look.\" And she gazed at her anxiously.\n\n\"I sometimes dream melancholy dreams,\" answered Caroline; \"and if I lie awake for an hour or two in the night, I am continually thinking of the rectory as a dreary old place. You know it is very near the churchyard. The back part of the house is extremely ancient, and it is said that the out-kitchens there were once enclosed in the churchyard, and that there are graves under them. I rather long to leave the rectory.\"\n\n\"My dear, you are surely not superstitious?\"\n\n\"No, Mrs. Pryor; but I think I grow what is called nervous. I see things under a darker aspect than I used to do. I have fears I never used to have\u2014not of ghosts, but of omens and disastrous events; and I have an inexpressible weight on my mind which I would give the world to shake off, and I cannot do it.\"\n\n\"Strange!\" cried Shirley. \"I never feel so.\" Mrs. Pryor said nothing.\n\n\"Fine weather, pleasant days, pleasant scenes, are powerless to give me pleasure,\" continued Caroline. \"Calm evenings are not calm to me. Moonlight, which I used to think mild, now only looks mournful. Is this weakness of mind, Mrs. Pryor, or what is it? I cannot help it. I often struggle against it. I reason; but reason and effort make no difference.\"\n\n\"You should take more exercise,\" said Mrs. Pryor.\n\n\"Exercise! I exercise sufficiently. I exercise till I am ready to drop.\"\n\n\"My dear, you should go from home.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Pryor, I should like to go from home, but not on any purposeless excursion or visit. I wish to be a governess, as you have been. It would oblige me greatly if you would speak to my uncle on the subject.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" broke in Shirley. \"What an idea! Be a governess! Better be a slave at once. Where is the necessity of it? Why should you dream of such a painful step?\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mrs. Pryor, \"you are very young to be a governess, and not sufficiently robust. The duties a governess undertakes are often severe.\"\n\n\"And I believe I want severe duties to occupy me.\"\n\n\"Occupy you!\" cried Shirley. \"When are you idle? I never saw a more industrious girl than you. You are always at work. Come,\" she continued\u2014\"come and sit by my side, and take some tea to refresh you. You don't care much for my friendship, then, that you wish to leave me?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do, Shirley; and I don't wish to leave you. I shall never find another friend so dear.\"\n\nAt which words Miss Keeldar put her hand into Caroline's with an impulsively affectionate movement, which was well seconded by the expression of her face.\n\n\"If you think so, you had better make much of me,\" she said, \"and not run away from me. I hate to part with those to whom I am become attached. Mrs. Pryor there sometimes talks of leaving me, and says I might make a more advantageous connection than herself. I should as soon think of exchanging an old-fashioned mother for something modish and stylish. As for you\u2014why, I began to flatter myself we were thoroughly friends; that you liked Shirley almost as well as Shirley likes you, and she does not stint her regard.\"\n\n\"I do like Shirley. I like her more and more every day. But that does not make me strong or happy.\"\n\n\"And would it make you strong or happy to go and live as a dependent amongst utter strangers? It would not. And the experiment must not be tried; I tell you it would fail. It is not in your nature to bear the desolate life governesses generally lead; you would fall ill. I won't hear of it.\"\n\nAnd Miss Keeldar paused, having uttered this prohibition very decidedly. Soon she recommenced, still looking somewhat courrouc\u00e9e, \"Why, it is my daily pleasure now to look out for the little cottage bonnet and the silk scarf glancing through the trees in the lane, and to know that my quiet, shrewd, thoughtful companion and monitress is coming back to me; that I shall have her sitting in the room to look at, to talk to or to let alone, as she and I please. This may be a selfish sort of language\u2014I know it is\u2014but it is the language which naturally rises to my lips, therefore I utter it.\"\n\n\"I would write to you, Shirley.\"\n\n\"And what are letters? Only a sort of pis aller. Drink some tea, Caroline. Eat something\u2014you eat nothing. Laugh and be cheerful, and stay at home.\"\n\nMiss Helstone shook her head and sighed. She felt what difficulty she would have to persuade any one to assist or sanction her in making that change in her life which she believed desirable. Might she only follow her own judgment, she thought she should be able to find perhaps a harsh but an effectual cure for her sufferings. But this judgment, founded on circumstances she could fully explain to none, least of all to Shirley, seemed, in all eyes but her own, incomprehensible and fantastic, and was opposed accordingly.\n\nThere really was no present pecuniary need for her to leave a comfortable home and \"take a situation;\" and there was every probability that her uncle might, in some way, permanently provide for her. So her friends thought, and, as far as their lights enabled them to see, they reasoned correctly; but of Caroline's strange sufferings, which she desired so eagerly to overcome or escape, they had no idea, of her racked nights and dismal days no suspicion. It was at once impossible and hopeless to explain; to wait and endure was her only plan. Many that want food and clothing have cheerier lives and brighter prospects than she had; many, harassed by poverty, are in a strait less afflictive.\n\n\"Now, is your mind quieted?\" inquired Shirley. \"Will you consent to stay at home?\"\n\n\"I shall not leave it against the approbation of my friends,\" was the reply; \"but I think in time they will be obliged to think as I do.\"\n\nDuring this conversation Mrs. Pryor looked far from easy. Her extreme habitual reserve would rarely permit her to talk freely or to interrogate others closely. She could think a multitude of questions she never ventured to put, give advice in her mind which her tongue never delivered. Had she been alone with Caroline, she might possibly have said something to the point: Miss Keeldar's presence, accustomed as she was to it, sealed her lips. Now, as on a thousand other occasions, inexplicable nervous scruples kept her back from interfering. She merely showed her concern for Miss Helstone in an indirect way, by asking her if the fire made her too warm, placing a screen between her chair and the hearth, closing a window whence she imagined a draught proceeded, and often and restlessly glancing at her. Shirley resumed: \"Having destroyed your plan,\" she said, \"which I hope I have done, I shall construct a new one of my own. Every summer I make an excursion. This season I propose spending two months either at the Scotch lochs or the English lakes\u2014that is, I shall go there provided you consent to accompany me. If you refuse, I shall not stir a foot.\"\n\n\"You are very good, Shirley.\"\n\n\"I would be very good if you would let me. I have every disposition to be good. It is my misfortune and habit, I know, to think of myself paramount to anybody else; but who is not like me in that respect? However, when Captain Keeldar is made comfortable, accommodated with all he wants, including a sensible, genial comrade, it gives him a thorough pleasure to devote his spare efforts to making that comrade happy. And should we not be happy, Caroline, in the Highlands? We will go to the Highlands. We will, if you can bear a sea-voyage, go to the Isles\u2014the Hebrides, the Shetland, the Orkney Islands. Would you not like that? I see you would.\u2014Mrs. Pryor, I call you to witness. Her face is all sunshine at the bare mention of it.\"\n\n\"I should like it much,\" returned Caroline, to whom, indeed, the notion of such a tour was not only pleasant, but gloriously reviving. Shirley rubbed her hands.\n\n\"Come; I can bestow a benefit,\" she exclaimed. \"I can do a good deed with my cash. My thousand a year is not merely a matter of dirty bank-notes and jaundiced guineas (let me speak respectfully of both, though, for I adore them), but, it may be, health to the drooping, strength to the weak, consolation to the sad. I was determined to make something of it better than a fine old house to live in, than satin gowns to wear, better than deference from acquaintance and homage from the poor. Here is to begin. This summer, Caroline, Mrs. Pryor and I go out into the North Atlantic, beyond the Shetland, perhaps to the Faroe Isles. We will see seals in Suderoe, and, doubtless, mermaids in Stromoe.\u2014Caroline is laughing, Mrs. Pryor. I made her laugh; I have done her good.\"\n\n\"I shall like to go, Shirley,\" again said Miss Helstone. \"I long to hear the sound of waves\u2014ocean-waves\u2014and to see them as I have imagined them in dreams, like tossing banks of green light, strewed with vanishing and reappearing wreaths of foam, whiter than lilies. I shall delight to pass the shores of those lone rock-islets where the sea-birds live and breed unmolested. We shall be on the track of the old Scandinavians\u2014of the Norsemen. We shall almost see the shores of Norway. This is a very vague delight that I feel, communicated by your proposal, but it is a delight.\"\n\n\"Will you think of Fitful Head now when you lie awake at night, of gulls shrieking round it, and waves tumbling in upon it, rather than of the graves under the rectory back-kitchen?\"\n\n\"I will try; and instead of musing about remnants of shrouds, and fragments of coffins, and human bones and mould, I will fancy seals lying in the sunshine on solitary shores, where neither fisherman nor hunter ever come; of rock crevices full of pearly eggs bedded in seaweed; of unscared birds covering white sands in happy flocks.\"\n\n\"And what will become of that inexpressible weight you said you had on your mind?\"\n\n\"I will try to forget it in speculation on the sway of the whole great deep above a herd of whales rushing through the livid and liquid thunder down from the frozen zone\u2014a hundred of them, perhaps, wallowing, flashing, rolling in the wake of a patriarch bull, huge enough to have been spawned before the Flood, such a creature as poor Smart had in his mind when he said,\u2014\n\n'Strong against tides, the enormous whale\nEmerges as he goes.'\"\n\"I hope our bark will meet with no such shoal, or herd as you term it, Caroline. (I suppose you fancy the sea-mammoths pasturing about the bases of the 'everlasting hills,' devouring strange provender in the vast valleys through and above which sea-billows roll.) I should not like to be capsized by the patriarch bull.\"\n\n\"I suppose you expect to see mermaids, Shirley?\"\n\n\"One of them, at any rate\u2014I do not bargain for less\u2014and she is to appear in some such fashion as this. I am to be walking by myself on deck, rather late of an August evening, watching and being watched by a full harvest moon. Something is to rise white on the surface of the sea, over which that moon mounts silent and hangs glorious. The object glitters and sinks. It rises again. I think I hear it cry with an articulate voice; I call you up from the cabin; I show you an image, fair as alabaster, emerging from the dim wave. We both see the long hair, the lifted and foam-white arm, the oval mirror brilliant as a star. It glides nearer; a human face is plainly visible\u2014a face in the style of yours\u2014whose straight, pure (excuse the word, it is appropriate)\u2014whose straight, pure lineaments paleness does not disfigure. It looks at us, but not with your eyes. I see a preternatural lure in its wily glance. It beckons. Were we men, we should spring at the sign\u2014the cold billow would be dared for the sake of the colder enchantress; being women, we stand safe, though not dreadless. She comprehends our unmoved gaze; she feels herself powerless; anger crosses her front; she cannot charm, but she will appal us; she rises high, and glides all revealed on the dark wave-ridge. Temptress-terror! monstrous likeness of ourselves! Are you not glad, Caroline, when at last, and with a wild shriek, she dives?\"\n\n\"But, Shirley, she is not like us. We are neither temptresses, nor terrors, nor monsters.\"\n\n\"Some of our kind, it is said, are all three. There are men who ascribe to 'woman,' in general, such attributes.\"\n\n\"My dears,\" here interrupted Mrs. Pryor, \"does it not strike you that your conversation for the last ten minutes has been rather fanciful?\"\n\n\"But there is no harm in our fancies; is there, ma'am?\"\n\n\"We are aware that mermaids do not exist; why speak of them as if they did? How can you find interest in speaking of a nonentity?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Shirley.\n\n\"My dear, I think there is an arrival. I heard a step in the lane while you were talking; and is not that the garden-gate which creaks?\"\n\nShirley stepped to the window.\n\n\"Yes, there is some one,\" said she, turning quietly away; and as she resumed her seat a sensitive flush animated her face, while a trembling ray at once kindled and softened her eye. She raised her hand to her chin, cast her gaze down, and seemed to think as she waited.\n\nThe servant announced Mr. Moore, and Shirley turned round when Mr. Moore appeared at the door. His figure seemed very tall as he entered, and stood in contrast with the three ladies, none of whom could boast a stature much beyond the average. He was looking well, better than he had been known to look for the past twelve months. A sort of renewed youth glowed in his eye and colour, and an invigorated hope and settled purpose sustained his bearing. Firmness his countenance still indicated, but not austerity. It looked as cheerful as it was earnest.\n\n\"I am just returned from Stilbro',\" he said to Miss Keeldar, as he greeted her; \"and I thought I would call to impart to you the result of my mission.\"\n\n\"You did right not to keep me in suspense,\" she said, \"and your visit is well timed. Sit down. We have not finished tea. Are you English enough to relish tea, or do you faithfully adhere to coffee?\"\n\nMoore accepted tea.\n\n\"I am learning to be a naturalized Englishman,\" said he; \"my foreign habits are leaving me one by one.\"\n\nAnd now he paid his respects to Mrs. Pryor, and paid them well, with a grave modesty that became his age compared with hers. Then he looked at Caroline\u2014not, however, for the first time: his glance had fallen upon her before. He bent towards her as she sat, gave her his hand, and asked her how she was. The light from the window did not fall upon Miss Helstone; her back was turned towards it. A quiet though rather low reply, a still demeanour, and the friendly protection of early twilight kept out of view each traitorous symptom. None could affirm that she had trembled or blushed, that her heart had quaked or her nerves thrilled; none could prove emotion; a greeting showing less effusion was never interchanged. Moore took the empty chair near her, opposite Miss Keeldar. He had placed himself well. His neighbour, screened by the very closeness of his vicinage from his scrutiny, and sheltered further by the dusk which deepened each moment, soon regained not merely seeming but real mastery of the feelings which had started into insurrection at the first announcement of his name.\n\nHe addressed his conversation to Miss Keeldar.\n\n\"I went to the barracks,\" he said, \"and had an interview with Colonel Ryde. He approved my plans, and promised the aid I wanted. Indeed, he offered a more numerous force than I require\u2014half a dozen will suffice. I don't intend to be swamped by redcoats. They are needed for appearance rather than anything else. My main reliance is on my own civilians.\"\n\n\"And on their captain,\" interposed Shirley.\n\n\"What, Captain Keeldar?\" inquired Moore, slightly smiling, and not lifting his eyes. The tone of raillery in which he said this was very respectful and suppressed.\n\n\"No,\" returned Shirley, answering the smile; \"Captain G\u00e9rard Moore, who trusts much to the prowess of his own right arm, I believe.\"\n\n\"Furnished with his counting-house ruler,\" added Moore. Resuming his usual gravity, he went on: \"I received by this evening's post a note from the Home Secretary in answer to mine. It appears they are uneasy at the state of matters here in the north; they especially condemn the supineness and pusillanimity of the mill-owners. They say, as I have always said, that inaction, under present circumstances, is criminal, and that cowardice is cruelty, since both can only encourage disorder, and lead finally to sanguinary outbreaks. There is the note\u2014I brought it for your perusal; and there is a batch of newspapers, containing further accounts of proceedings in Nottingham, Manchester, and elsewhere.\"\n\nHe produced letters and journals, and laid them before Miss Keeldar. While she perused them he took his tea quietly; but though his tongue was still, his observant faculties seemed by no means off duty. Mrs. Pryor, sitting in the background, did not come within the range of his glance, but the two younger ladies had the full benefit thereof.\n\nMiss Keeldar, placed directly opposite, was seen without effort. She was the object his eyes, when lifted, naturally met first; and as what remained of daylight\u2014the gilding of the west\u2014was upon her, her shape rose in relief from the dark panelling behind. Shirley's clear cheek was tinted yet with the colour which had risen into it a few minutes since. The dark lashes of her eyes looking down as she read, the dusk yet delicate line of her eyebrows, the almost sable gloss of her curls, made her heightened complexion look fine as the bloom of a red wild flower by contrast. There was natural grace in her attitude, and there was artistic effect in the ample and shining folds of her silk dress\u2014an attire simply fashioned, but almost splendid from the shifting brightness of its dye, warp and woof being of tints deep and changing as the hue on a pheasant's neck. A glancing bracelet on her arm produced the contrast of gold and ivory. There was something brilliant in the whole picture. It is to be supposed that Moore thought so, as his eye dwelt long on it, but he seldom permitted his feelings or his opinions to exhibit themselves in his face. His temperament boasted a certain amount of phlegm, and he preferred an undemonstrative, not ungentle, but serious aspect to any other.\n\nHe could not, by looking straight before him, see Caroline, as she was close at his side. It was necessary, therefore, to man\u0153uvre a little to get her well within the range of his observation. He leaned back in his chair, and looked down on her. In Miss Helstone neither he nor any one else could discover brilliancy. Sitting in the shade, without flowers or ornaments, her attire the modest muslin dress, colourless but for its narrow stripe of pale azure, her complexion unflushed, unexcited, the very brownness of her hair and eyes invisible by this faint light, she was, compared with the heiress, as a graceful pencil sketch compared with a vivid painting. Since Robert had seen her last a great change had been wrought in her. Whether he perceived it might not be ascertained. He said nothing to that effect.\n\n\"How is Hortense?\" asked Caroline softly.\n\n\"Very well; but she complains of being unemployed. She misses you.\"\n\n\"Tell her that I miss her, and that I write and read a portion of French every day.\"\n\n\"She will ask if you sent your love; she is always particular on that point. You know she likes attention.\"\n\n\"My best love\u2014my very best. And say to her that whenever she has time to write me a little note I shall be glad to hear from her.\"\n\n\"What if I forget? I am not the surest messenger of compliments.\"\n\n\"No, don't forget, Robert. It is no compliment; it is in good earnest.\"\n\n\"And must, therefore, be delivered punctually.\"\n\n\"If you please.\"\n\n\"Hortense will be ready to shed tears. She is tenderhearted on the subject of her pupil; yet she reproaches you sometimes for obeying your uncle's injunctions too literally. Affection, like love, will be unjust now and then.\"\n\nAnd Caroline made no answer to this observation; for indeed her heart was troubled, and to her eyes she would have raised her handkerchief if she had dared. If she had dared, too, she would have declared how the very flowers in the garden of Hollow's Cottage were dear to her; how the little parlour of that house was her earthly paradise; how she longed to return to it, as much almost as the first woman, in her exile, must have longed to revisit Eden. Not daring, however, to say these things, she held her peace; she sat quiet at Robert's side, waiting for him to say something more. It was long since this proximity had been hers\u2014long since his voice had addressed her; could she, with any show of probability, even of possibility, have imagined that the meeting gave him pleasure, to her it would have given deep bliss. Yet, even in doubt that it pleased, in dread that it might annoy him, she received the boon of the meeting as an imprisoned bird would the admission of sunshine to its cage. It was of no use arguing, contending against the sense of present happiness; to be near Robert was to be revived.\n\nMiss Keeldar laid down the papers.\n\n\"And are you glad or sad for all these menacing tidings?\" she inquired of her tenant.\n\n\"Not precisely either; but I certainly am instructed. I see that our only plan is to be firm. I see that efficient preparation and a resolute attitude are the best means of averting bloodshed.\"\n\nHe then inquired if she had observed some particular paragraph, to which she replied in the negative, and he rose to show it to her. He continued the conversation standing before her. From the tenor of what he said, it appeared evident that they both apprehended disturbances in the neighbourhood of Briarfield, though in what form they expected them to break out was not specified. Neither Caroline nor Mrs. Pryor asked questions. The subject did not appear to be regarded as one ripe for free discussion; therefore the lady and her tenant were suffered to keep details to themselves, unimportuned by the curiosity of their listeners.\n\nMiss Keeldar, in speaking to Mr. Moore, took a tone at once animated and dignified, confidential and self-respecting. When, however, the candles were brought in, and the fire was stirred up, and the fullness of light thus produced rendered the expression of her countenance legible, you could see that she was all interest, life, and earnestness. There was nothing coquettish in her demeanour; whatever she felt for Moore she felt it seriously. And serious, too, were his feelings, and settled were his views, apparently, for he made no petty effort to attract, dazzle, or impress. He contrived, notwithstanding, to command a little; because the deeper voice, however mildly modulated, the somewhat harder mind, now and then, though involuntarily and unintentionally, bore down by some peremptory phrase or tone the mellow accents and susceptible, if high, nature of Shirley. Miss Keeldar looked happy in conversing with him, and her joy seemed twofold\u2014a joy of the past and present, of memory and of hope.\n\nWhat I have just said are Caroline's ideas of the pair. She felt what has just been described. In thus feeling she tried not to suffer, but suffered sharply nevertheless. She suffered, indeed, miserably. A few minutes before her famished heart had tasted a drop and crumb of nourishment, that, if freely given, would have brought back abundance of life where life was failing; but the generous feast was snatched from her, spread before another, and she remained but a bystander at the banquet.\n\nThe clock struck nine; it was Caroline's time for going home. She gathered up her work, put the embroidery, the scissors, the thimble into her bag. She bade Mrs. Pryor a quiet good-night, receiving from that lady a warmer pressure of the hand than usual. She stepped up to Miss Keeldar.\n\n\"Good-night, Shirley!\"\n\nShirley started up. \"What! so soon? Are you going already?\"\n\n\"It is past nine.\"\n\n\"I never heard the clock. You will come again to-morrow, and you will be happy to-night, will you not? Remember our plans.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Caroline; \"I have not forgotten.\"\n\nHer mind misgave her that neither those plans nor any other could permanently restore her mental tranquillity. She turned to Robert, who stood close behind her. As he looked up, the light of the candles on the mantelpiece fell full on her face. All its paleness, all its change, all its forlorn meaning were clearly revealed. Robert had good eyes, and might have seen it if he would; whether he did see it, nothing indicated.\n\n\"Good-night!\" she said, shaking like a leaf, offering her thin hand hastily, anxious to part from him quickly.\n\n\"You are going home?\" he asked, not touching her hand.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Is Fanny come for you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I may as well accompany you a step of the way; not up to the rectory, though, lest my old friend Helstone should shoot me from the window.\"\n\nHe laughed, and took his hat. Caroline spoke of unnecessary trouble; he told her to put on her bonnet and shawl. She was quickly ready, and they were soon both in the open air. Moore drew her hand under his arm, just in his old manner\u2014that manner which she ever felt to be so kind.\n\n\"You may run on, Fanny,\" he said to the housemaid; \"we shall overtake you.\" And when the girl had got a little in advance, he enclosed Caroline's hand in his, and said he was glad to find she was a familiar guest at Fieldhead. He hoped her intimacy with Miss Keeldar would continue; such society would be both pleasant and improving.\n\nCaroline replied that she liked Shirley.\n\n\"And there is no doubt the liking is mutual,\" said Moore. \"If she professes friendship, be certain she is sincere. She cannot feign; she scorns hypocrisy. And, Caroline, are we never to see you at Hollow's Cottage again?\"\n\n\"I suppose not, unless my uncle should change his mind.\"\n\n\"Are you much alone now?\"\n\n\"Yes, a good deal. I have little pleasure in any society but Miss Keeldar's.\"\n\n\"Have you been quite well lately?\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"You must take care of yourself. Be sure not to neglect exercise. Do you know I fancied you somewhat altered\u2014a little fallen away, and pale. Is your uncle kind to you?\"\n\n\"Yes; he is just as he always is.\"\n\n\"Not too tender, that is to say\u2014not too protective and attentive. And what ails you, then? Tell me, Lina.\"\n\n\"Nothing, Robert.\" But her voice faltered.\n\n\"That is to say, nothing that you will tell me. I am not to be taken into confidence. Separation is then quite to estrange us, is it?\"\n\n\"I do not know. Sometimes I almost fear it is.\"\n\n\"But it ought not to have that effect. 'Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and days o' lang syne?'\"\n\n\"Robert, I don't forget.\"\n\n\"It is two months, I should think, Caroline, since you were at the cottage.\"\n\n\"Since I was within it\u2014yes.\"\n\n\"Have you ever passed that way in your walk?\"\n\n\"I have come to the top of the fields sometimes of an evening and looked down. Once I saw Hortense in the garden watering her flowers, and I know at what time you light your lamp in the counting-house. I have waited for it to shine out now and then, and I have seen you bend between it and the window. I knew it was you; I could almost trace the outline of your form.\"\n\n\"I wonder I never encountered you. I occasionally walk to the top of the Hollow's fields after sunset.\"\n\n\"I know you do. I had almost spoken to you one night, you passed so near me.\"\n\n\"Did I? I passed near you, and did not see you! Was I alone?\"\n\n\"I saw you twice, and neither time were you alone.\"\n\n\"Who was my companion? Probably nothing but Joe Scott, or my own shadow by moonlight.\"\n\n\"No; neither Joe Scott nor your shadow, Robert. The first time you were with Mr. Yorke; and the second time what you call your shadow was a shape with a white forehead and dark curls, and a sparkling necklace round its neck. But I only just got a glimpse of you and that fairy shadow; I did not wait to hear you converse.\"\n\n\"It appears you walk invisible. I noticed a ring on your hand this evening; can it be the ring of Gyges? Henceforth, when sitting in the counting-house by myself, perhaps at dead of night, I shall permit myself to imagine that Caroline may be leaning over my shoulder reading with me from the same book, or sitting at my side engaged in her own particular task, and now and then raising her unseen eyes to my face to read there my thoughts.\"\n\n\"You need fear no such infliction. I do not come near you; I only stand afar off, watching what may become of you.\"\n\n\"When I walk out along the hedgerows in the evening after the mill is shut, or at night when I take the watchman's place, I shall fancy the flutter of every little bird over its nest, the rustle of every leaf, a movement made by you; tree-shadows will take your shape; in the white sprays of hawthorn I shall imagine glimpses of you. Lina, you will haunt me.\"\n\n\"I will never be where you would not wish me to be, nor see nor hear what you would wish unseen and unheard.\"\n\n\"I shall see you in my very mill in broad daylight. Indeed, I have seen you there once. But a week ago I was standing at the top of one of my long rooms; girls were working at the other end, and amongst half a dozen of them, moving to and fro, I seemed to see a figure resembling yours. It was some effect of doubtful light or shade, or of dazzling sunbeam. I walked up to this group. What I sought had glided away; I found myself between two buxom lasses in pinafores.\"\n\n\"I shall not follow you into your mill, Robert, unless you call me there.\"\n\n\"Nor is that the only occasion on which imagination has played me a trick. One night, when I came home late from market, I walked into the cottage parlour thinking to find Hortense; but instead of her I thought I found you. There was no candle in the room; my sister had taken the light upstairs with her. The window-blind was not drawn, and broad moonbeams poured through the panes. There you were, Lina, at the casement, shrinking a little to one side in an attitude not unusual with you. You were dressed in white, as I have seen you dressed at an evening party. For half a second your fresh, living face seemed turned towards me, looking at me; for half a second my idea was to go and take your hand, to chide you for your long absence, and welcome your present visit. Two steps forward broke the spell. The drapery of the dress changed outline; the tints of the complexion dissolved, and were formless. Positively, as I reached the spot, there was nothing left but the sweep of a white muslin curtain, and a balsam plant in a flower-pot, covered with a flush of bloom. 'Sic transit,' et cetera.\"\n\n\"It was not my wraith, then? I almost thought it was.\"\n\n\"No; only gauze, crockery, and pink blossom\u2014a sample of earthly illusions.\"\n\n\"I wonder you have time for such illusions, occupied as your mind must be.\"\n\n\"So do I. But I find in myself, Lina, two natures\u2014one for the world and business, and one for home and leisure. G\u00e9rard Moore is a hard dog, brought up to mill and market; the person you call your cousin Robert is sometimes a dreamer, who lives elsewhere than in Cloth-hall and counting-house.\"\n\n\"Your two natures agree with you. I think you are looking in good spirits and health. You have quite lost that harassed air which it often pained one to see in your face a few months ago.\"\n\n\"Do you observe that? Certainly I am disentangled of some difficulties. I have got clear of some shoals, and have more sea-room.\"\n\n\"And, with a fair wind, you may now hope to make a prosperous voyage?\"\n\n\"I may hope it\u2014yes\u2014but hope is deceptive. There is no controlling wind or wave. Gusts and swells perpetually trouble the mariner's course; he dare not dismiss from his mind the expectation of tempest.\"\n\n\"But you are ready for a breeze; you are a good seaman, an able commander. You are a skilful pilot, Robert; you will weather the storm.\"\n\n\"My kinswoman always thinks the best of me, but I will take her words for a propitious omen. I will consider that in meeting her to-night I have met with one of those birds whose appearance is to the sailor the harbinger of good luck.\"\n\n\"A poor harbinger of good luck is she who can do nothing, who has no power. I feel my incapacity. It is of no use saying I have the will to serve you when I cannot prove it. Yet I have that will. I wish you success. I wish you high fortune and true happiness.\"\n\n\"When did you ever wish me anything else? What is Fanny waiting for? I told her to walk on. Oh! we have reached the churchyard. Then we are to part here, I suppose. We might have sat a few minutes in the church porch, if the girl had not been with us. It is so fine a night, so summer-mild and still, I have no particular wish to return yet to the Hollow.\"\n\n\"But we cannot sit in the porch now, Robert.\"\n\nCaroline said this because Moore was turning her round towards it.\n\n\"Perhaps not. But tell Fanny to go in. Say we are coming. A few minutes will make no difference.\"\n\nThe church clock struck ten.\n\n\"My uncle will be coming out to take his usual sentinel round, and he always surveys the church and churchyard.\"\n\n\"And if he does? If it were not for Fanny, who knows we are here, I should find pleasure in dodging and eluding him. We could be under the east window when he is at the porch; as he came round to the north side we could wheel off to the south; we might at a pinch hide behind some of the monuments. That tall erection of the Wynnes would screen us completely.\"\n\n\"Robert, what good spirits you have! Go! go!\" added Caroline hastily. \"I hear the front door\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"I don't want to go; on the contrary, I want to stay.\"\n\n\"You know my uncle will be terribly angry. He forbade me to see you because you are a Jacobin.\"\n\n\"A queer Jacobin!\"\n\n\"Go, Robert, he is coming; I hear him cough.\"\n\n\"Diable! It is strange\u2014what a pertinacious wish I feel to stay!\"\n\n\"You remember what he did to Fanny's\u2014\" began Caroline, and stopped abruptly short. \"Sweetheart\" was the word that ought to have followed, but she could not utter it. It seemed calculated to suggest ideas she had no intention to suggest\u2014ideas delusive and disturbing. Moore was less scrupulous. \"Fanny's sweetheart?\" he said at once. \"He gave him a shower-bath under the pump, did he not? He'd do as much for me, I dare say, with pleasure. I should like to provoke the old Turk\u2014not, however, against you. But he would make a distinction between a cousin and a lover, would he not?\"\n\n\"Oh, he would not think of you in that way, of course not; his quarrel with you is entirely political. Yet I should not like the breach to be widened, and he is so testy. Here he is at the garden gate. For your own sake and mine, Robert, go!\"\n\nThe beseeching words were aided by a beseeching gesture and a more beseeching look. Moore covered her clasped hands an instant with his, answered her upward by a downward gave, gaze said \"Good-night!\" and went.\n\nCaroline was in a moment at the kitchen door behind Fanny. The shadow of the shovel-hat at that very instant fell on a moonlit tomb. The rector emerged, erect as a cane, from his garden, and proceeded in slow march, his hands behind him, down the cemetery. Moore was almost caught. He had to \"dodge\" after all, to coast round the church, and finally to bend his tall form behind the Wynnes' ambitious monument. There he was forced to hide full ten minutes, kneeling with one knee on the turf, his hat off, his curls bare to the dew, his dark eye shining, and his lips parted with inward laughter at his position; for the rector meantime stood coolly star-gazing, and taking snuff within three feet of him.\n\nIt happened, however, that Mr. Helstone had no suspicion whatever on his mind; for being usually but vaguely informed of his niece's movements, not thinking it worth while to follow them closely, he was not aware that she had been out at all that day, and imagined her then occupied with book or work in her chamber\u2014where, indeed, she was by this time, though not absorbed in the tranquil employment he ascribed to her, but standing at her window with fast-throbbing heart, peeping anxiously from behind the blind, watching for her uncle to re-enter and her cousin to escape. And at last she was gratified. She heard Mr. Helstone come in; she saw Robert stride the tombs and vault the wall; she then went down to prayers. When she returned to her chamber, it was to meet the memory of Robert. Slumber's visitation was long averted. Long she sat at her lattice, long gazed down on the old garden and older church, on the tombs laid out all gray and calm, and clear in moonlight. She followed the steps of the night, on its pathway of stars, far into the \"wee sma' hours ayont the twal'.\" She was with Moore, in spirit, the whole time; she was at his side; she heard his voice; she gave her hand into his hand; it rested warm in his fingers. When the church clock struck, when any other sound stirred, when a little mouse familiar to her chamber\u2014an intruder for which she would never permit Fanny to lay a trap\u2014came rattling amongst the links of her locket-chain, her one ring, and another trinket or two on the toilet-table, to nibble a bit of biscuit laid ready for it, she looked up, recalled momentarily to the real. Then she said half aloud, as if deprecating the accusation of some unseen and unheard monitor, \"I am not cherishing love dreams; I am only thinking because I cannot sleep. Of course, I know he will marry Shirley.\"\n\nWith returning silence, with the lull of the chime, and the retreat of her small untamed and unknown prot\u00e9g\u00e9, she still resumed the dream, nestling to the vision's side\u2014listening to, conversing with it. It paled at last. As dawn approached, the setting stars and breaking day dimmed the creation of fancy; the wakened song of birds hushed her whispers. The tale full of fire, quick with interest, borne away by the morning wind, became a vague murmur. The shape that, seen in a moonbeam, lived, had a pulse, had movement, wore health's glow and youth's freshness, turned cold and ghostly gray, confronted with the red of sunrise. It wasted. She was left solitary at last. She crept to her couch, chill and dejected.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/3010405", "artist_names": "Riverdale", "full_title": "Chapter One: The River's Edge by\u00a0Riverdale", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://i.genius.com/37bfe982a37a8dc99377f269e8eaa3042cbbfffe?url=http%3A%2F%2Fis2.mzstatic.com%2Fimage%2Fthumb%2FMusic111%2Fv4%2Fd3%2Fbb%2Fee%2Fd3bbeee0-f366-d06d-5f3b-1f600adf1eac%2Fsource%2F1200x1200.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://i.genius.com/37bfe982a37a8dc99377f269e8eaa3042cbbfffe?url=http%3A%2F%2Fis2.mzstatic.com%2Fimage%2Fthumb%2FMusic111%2Fv4%2Fd3%2Fbb%2Fee%2Fd3bbeee0-f366-d06d-5f3b-1f600adf1eac%2Fsource%2F1200x1200.jpg", "id": 3010405, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 2034060, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1667754275, "path": "/Riverdale-chapter-one-the-rivers-edge-annotated", "pyongs_count": 3, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Riverdale-chapter-one-the-rivers-edge-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 26}, "release_date_for_display": "January 26, 2017", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jan. 26, 2017", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/012bc9dc0af0243cc98dac8bcc539e8c.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/012bc9dc0af0243cc98dac8bcc539e8c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 24010}, "title": "Chapter One: The River\u2019s Edge", "title_with_featured": "Chapter One: The River's Edge", "updated_by_human_at": 1667754275, "url": "https://genius.com/Riverdale-chapter-one-the-rivers-edge-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/1092115", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/800cec4fbbdea81cd29b83a248c08d34.1000x525x1.png", "id": 1092115, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/91b514f2acbcc34931a032482942dd8b.818x818x1.jpg", "index_character": "r", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Riverdale", "slug": "Riverdale", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Riverdale"}, "artist": "Riverdale", "lyrics": "Chapter One: The River\u2019s Edge Lyrics[BIRD'S EYE-VIEW of an American SMALL TOWN.]\n[A Male Teenager\u2019s VOICE-OVER narrates]\n\nUNSEEN MALE TEEN (V.O.): Our story is about a town.

And I won\u2019t tell anyone about July Fourth, ever -- deal?\n\n[Fuck, is Archie blackmailing Ms. Grundy? Is that the kind of show we\u2019re doing?]\n\nMS. GRUNDY: ...Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 7:30\nAM, before First Period, I\u2019ll set it up. And see about getting you credit.\n\n[Ms. Grundy then stands up and strides away]\n\n[CUT TO Moose and Reggie spiking the punch. Veronica walks by dragging Kevin, who stares at Moose.]\n\nCHERYL (O.S.): Good evening, friends. Are you all having a good time?\n\n[CUT TO Cheryl emceeing on stage in a extravagant crimson gown. The crowd applauds and cheers]\n\nCHERYL: As honorary chair-person, and de-facto queen of tonight's semi-formal, it is my great pleasure to introduce this evening's main entertainment. To know them is to be obsessed with them. Although they usually perform their own material, tonight they're making an exception and debuting a cover of the song my parents claim they were listening to the night Jason and I were conceived. This one's for you Jay-Jay.\n\n[We see Archie making his way over to Betty]\n\nARCHIE: Sorry about that.\n\nCHERYL: (gestures to them) -- I give you Josie and the Pussycats.\n\n[Crowd cheers and applauds as Cheryl cedes the stage to Josie, Melody, and Valerie.]\n\nARCHIE: Want to dance?\n\nBETTY (smiling): Yeah!\n\n[They start to slow dance]\n\nBETTY: Did that go okay?\n\nARCHIE: Yeah, yes, so I'll study with Ms. Grundy before school, football practice after school, and working at my Dad\u2019s on weekends, it\u2019ll gonna be nuts --\n\nBETTY: -- so long as you don\u2019t give up your passion...\n\n[We cut to Josie and the Pussycats playing as well as a wide view of all the couples dancing]\n\n[Betty looks over at Veronica and Kevin, who are both mouthing \"Do it!\" to her]\n\nBETTY: Uhm. Now that I\u2019m a River Vixen and you\u2019re gonna be on Varsity Football, I have this fantasy of us as a power-couple, or maybe even just as a couple.\n\nARCHIE: Betty?\n\nBETTY: Is that so impossible to imagine?\n\n[Archie looks from Betty, to Ms. Grundy, standing off to the side.]\n\n[The song finishes and Betty and Archie separate, clearly feeling awkward towards one another. Cheryl, off to the side standing with two minions, also notices this.]\n\nCHERYL (to the minions): Make sure those two turtledoves come to my afterparty. Veronica too.\n(smiles)\nI'm in the mood for chaos.[INT. BLOSSOM HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT]\n\nCHERYL: It's game time at Che Blossom's, kiddies. We're going old-school tonight. Seven Minutes in Heaven.\n\n[Both Veronica and Betty smile at each other, assuring one another that they have each other's back]\n\nCHERYL: Who wants to tryst in the Closet of Love first? My vote is \u201cA\u201d for Archie. Anyone care to second it?\n\n[Both Veronica and Betty look at Archie, who is standing off to the side, not in the mood]\n\nARCHIE: Uh, actually --\n\nREGGIE (raising his hand): Yes -- Andrews -- YES\n(clearly drunk)\nHuh hah, cool!\n\nCHERYL: All right, gather round, Kids, let's see who's riding the Ginger Stallion tonight.\n\n[Cheryl spins a bottle. All eyes are on the bottle of Cherry as it spins around. Cheryl moves around slyly, observing the bottle and her two targets: Veronica and Betty]\n\n[The bottle eventually lands between Veronica and Betty]\n\nREGGIE: Ohh, no! No way!\n\n[Veronica and Betty look at each other]\n\nCHERYL: It's clearly pointing to, the new girl. This should be fun.\n\nVERONICA: I\u2019m not doing this.\n\nCHERYL: That\u2019s up to you. But, if you don\u2019t, House Rules decree the Host gets to take your turn.\n\n[Betty looks at Archie pleadfully][INT. BLOSSOM HOUSE - BASEMENT CLOSET - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)]\n\n[DARKNESS. Then -- one iPhone lights up. Then -- a second iPhone lights up. Archie and Veronica, lit only by their cell phones, huddle in the dark...]\n\nVERONICA: I know her brother died and everything, but Cheryl Blossom truly is the Anti-Christ.\n\n[They both chuckle]\n\nARCHIE: So, do you miss New York?\n\nVERONICA: It\u2019s been less than a week. But yes.\n\nARCHIE: Six minutes, twenty seconds. Okay, your turn. Ask me a deep, probing question. To, uhm. Kill time.\n\nVERONICA: It looked like you and Betty were having fun at the dance.\n\nARCHIE: Definitely. We\u2019ve been friends forever. My turn.\n\nVERONICA: I didn\u2019t ask my question yet. Is that all it is? Just friends?\n\nARCHIE: We're not just friends, we're best friends. My turn: Did you have a boyfriend back in New York?\n\nVERONICA: No. My turn: Could it ever possibly become something more?\n\nARCHIE: Are you asking for Betty or for yourself?\n\nVERONICA: For Betty -- and you didn\u2019t answer my question.\n\nARCHIE: I\u2019ve never felt -- whatever it is I\u2019m supposed to feel -- with Betty.\n\nVERONICA: Have you felt it, though? With anyone?\n\nARCHIE: -- yeah -- this summer -- have you?\n\nVERONICA: Maybe once.\n(then, realizing)\nYou\u2019re a little more dangerous than you look, aren\u2019t you? All Boy-Next-Door-ish?\n\nARCHIE: You have no idea...\n\nVERONICA: Your turn. Ask me a question, Archie...\n(putting it out there)\nAsk me anything you want...\n\n[The air -- the space -- between them is THICK with sexual tension.]\n\nVEORNICA: We shouldn't do this.\n\nARCHIE: We definitely shouldn't do this.\n\n[So Archie and Veronica start to kiss... Tentatively at first, then more and more passionately...][INT. BLOSSOM HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT (6.5 MINUTES LATER)]\n\n[Sheepishly, Archie and Veronica emerge from the closet...]\n\nREGGIE: Nailed it. Yes!\n\nVERONICA: Where's Betty?\n\nCHERYL: She spiraled and fled. Between us, she's a lot more high-strung than she looks.\n\nVERONICA: You shady bitch.\n\n[Archie and Veronica trade a look. And then both stride away to look for Betty]\n\n[Cheryl looks at them, not the least bit concerned]\n\nARCHIE: Crap! Betty's cell is off.\n\nVERONICA: I\u2019ll getting an Uber.\n\nARCHIE: Can I come with you? We should probably try to find her.\n\nVERONICA: Believe me, the last thing Betty wants is us tracking her down, together. We messed up.\n\n[From the look on Veronica\u2019s face, we can tell: She's already regretting those seven minutes...][INT. THE LODGE APARTMENT - NIGHT]\n\n[Veronica comes home from Cheryl\u2019s, to find Hermione, having a glass of wine.]\n\nHERMIONE: Hey, you're home early. How was the dance?\n\nVERONICA (covering): It was fine. I mean, it's not the Met Ball or anything...\n\nHERMIONE: Tell me about it.\n\nVERONICA: I\u2019m super-tired, Mom.\n\n[Veronica lays down, laying her head down in her mother's lap]\n\nHERMIONE: Is everything okay? Roni, hey, what is it?\n\n[Veronica doesn't answer][EXT. POP'S CHOCK\u2019LIT SHOPPE DINER - NIGHT]\nWalking home from the after-party, reeling from the night, Archie passes the one place in town that's open. POP\u2019S diner.]\n\nJUGHEAD: It was midnight, when my old friend, Archie Andrews, arrived at the one place in town that's still open. He was looking for the girl next door. Instead, he found me.[INT. POP'S DINER - NIGHT]\n\n[Archie walks into the diner, notices Jughead at a booth. The two lock eyes, then Archie walks over to Pop Tate at the counter]\n\nARCHIE: Hey, Pop. Betty hasn't come in tonight, has she?\n\nPOP: No. Just the Nighthawk's in tonight.\n\n[Pop nods towards Jughead]\n\nARCHIE (to Pop): Thanks.\n\n[Archie then proceeds to move over to where Jughead is sitting]\n\nARCHIE: Oh, can I sit, Jughead?\n\nJUGHEAD (shrugs): If you want.\n\n[Archie does so]\n\nARCHIE: What are you working on?\n\nJUGHEAD: My novel. It's about this summer -- and Jason Blossom.\n\n[We see the screen, which has Apple Pages open with a page open of the novel]\n\nARCHIE: Seventeen years old...and how will he be remembered? As Captain of the Water Polo Team?\n\nJUGHEAD: The Aquaholics? Considering how he died, probably not.\n\nARCHIE: No, what I mean is, was he doing everything he was supposed to do? Everything he wanted -- I mean, did he even know what that was?\n\n[Neither say anything, until Jughead changes the subject]\n\nJUGHEAD: Coach Clayton was in here talking to Pop Tate. Varsity? Does that make you, what, Mr. Popular Football God now?\n\nARCHIE: No. In fact, I'm kind of terrified I lost my best friend tonight.\n\nJUGHEAD: If you mean Betty, whatever happened, just talk to her, man. That would go a long way.\n(then)\nWould\u2019ve gone a long way with me.[EXT. THE ANDREWS HOUSE - NIGHT]\n\n[This late, Archie's exhausted, but wired. As he starts up the walk to his house, Betty steps out of the front door. She'd been waiting for him]\n\nBETTY: ...I'm not going to ask what you did with\nVeronica at Cheryl's -- but I\u2019m asking you now, right now, if you love me, Archie? Or even like me?\n\nARCHIE: Of course I love you, Betty, but...I can't give you the answer you want...\n\nBETTY: Why?\n\nARCHIE: You\u2019re so perfect, I\u2019ve never be good enough for you...I\u2019ll never be good enough for you...\n\n[The two life-long friends look at each other -- hearts breaking -- a truth between them finally spoken aloud....Betty, with tears starting to to stream down her face, turns and walks into her home, and closes the door]\n\nJUGHEAD (V.O.): And so, it wasn't one heart that broke that night. It was two. And the night was far from over.[EXT. SWEETWATER RIVER - NIGHT]\n\n[Moose and Kevin exit Moose's car at the edge of the Sweetwater River]\n\nMOOSE: For the record, I'm not gay.\n\nKEVIN: Obviously not Moose, you're on the football team. But if you were gay, what would you like to do?\n\nMOOSE: Everything but kiss.\n\nKEVIN (laughs): I love a good closet case.\n\n[The two walk down to the river, while each starting to remove their outer layers]\n\nKEVIN: So, let's start with skinny-dipping. And then see what happens?\n\n[Kevin trips over himself when walking backwards]\n\nMOOSE: Dude! Are you okay?\n\n[Kevin stares, mouth wide-open at something in the river. Moose notices this and stares as well]\n\n[A body, in a white suit, is lying face up in the water. The camera then repositions to pan towards the head of the body, which we see is Jason \u2013 who has a gunshot wound just above the eyes. His mouth is open]\n\nKEVIN: Oh my God, Jason -- he was shot.[INT. POP'S DINER - NIGHT]\n\n[Jughead, typing away at his keyboard, resuming with his V-O]\nJUGHEAD (V.O.): ...by morning, everyone would be talking,\ntexting, and posting about it...

"Howard-zinn", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Howard-zinn"}, "artist": "Howard Zinn", "lyrics": "Chapter 18: The Impossible Victory: Vietnam LyricsFrom 1964 to 1972, the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the history of the world made a maximum military effort, with everything short of atomic bombs, to defeat a nationalist revolutionary movement in a tiny, peasant country-and failed. When the United States fought in Vietnam, it was organized modern technology versus organized human beings, and the human beings won.\n\nIn the course of that war, there developed in the United States the greatest antiwar movement the nation had ever experienced, a movement that played a critical part in bringing the war to an end.\n\nIt was another startling fact of the sixties.\n\nIn the fall of 1945 Japan, defeated, was forced to leave Indochina, the former French colony it had occupied at the start of the war. In the meantime, a revolutionary movement had grown there, determined to end colonial control and to achieve a new life for the peasants of Indochina. Led by a Communist named Ho Chi Minh, the revolutionists fought against the Japanese, and when they were gone held a spectacular celebration in Hanoi in late 1945, with a million people in the streets, and issued a Declaration of Independence. It borrowed from the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, in the French Revolution, and from the American Declaration of Independence, and began: \"All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\" Just as the Americans in 1776 had listed their grievances against the English King, the Vietnamese listed their complaints against French rule:\n\nThey have enforced inhuman laws.... They have built more prisons than schools. They have mercilessly slain our patriots, they have drowned uprisings in rivers of blood. They have fettered public opinion.... They have robbed us of our rice fields, our mines, our forests, and our raw materials... .\n\nThey have invented numerous unjustifiable taxes and reduced our people, especially our peasantry, to a state of extreme poverty. ...\n...from the end of last year, to the beginning of this year . . . more than two million of our fellow-citizens died of starvation. .. .\n\nThe whole Vietnamese people, animated by a common purpose, are determined to fight to the bitter end against any attempt by the French colonialists to reconquer their country.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department study of the Vietnam war, intended to be \"top secret\" but released to the public by Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo in the famous Pentagon Papers case, described Ho Chi Minh's work:\n\n.. . Ho had built the Viet Minh into the only Vietnam-wide political organization capable of effective resistance to either the Japanese or the French. He was the only Vietnamese wartime leader with a national following, and he assured himself wider fealty among the Vietnamese people when in August-September, 1945, he overthrew the Japanese . .. established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and staged receptions for in-coming allied occupation forces.. .. For a few weeks in September, 1945, Vietnam was\u2014for the first and only time in its modern history\u2014free of foreign domination, and united from north to south under Ho Chi Minh. .. .\n\nThe Western powers were already at work to change this. England occupied the southern part of Indochina and then turned it back to the French. Nationalist China (this was under Chiang Kai- shek, before the Communist revolution) occupied the northern part of Indochina, and the United States persuaded it to turn that back to the French. As Ho Chi Minh told an American journalist: \"We apparently stand quite alone.. .. We shall Have to depend on ourselves.\"\n\nBetween October 1945 and February 1946, Ho Chi Minh wrote eight letters to President Truman, reminding him of the self-determination promises of the Atlantic Charter. One of the letters was sent both to Truman and to the United Nations:\n\nI wish to invite attention of your Excellency for strictly humanitarian reasons to following matter. Two million Vietnamese died of starvation during winter of 1944 and spring 1945 because of starvation policy of French who seized and stored until it controlled all available rice. ... Three- fourths of cultivated land was flooded in summer 1945, which was followed by a severe drought; of normal harvest five-sixths was lost. ... Many people are starving. .. . Unless great world powers and international relief organizations bring us immediate assistance we face imminent catastrophe...\n\nTruman never replied.\n\nIn October of 1946, the French bombarded Haiphong, a port in northern Vietnam, and there began the eight-year war between the Vietminh movement and the French over who would rule Vietnam. After the Communist victory in China in 1949 and the Korean war the following year, the United States began giving large amounts of military aid to the French. By 1954, the United States had given 300,000 small arms and machine guns, enough to equip the entire French army in Indochina, and $1 billion; all together, the U.S. was financing 80 percent of the French war effort.\n\nWhy was the United States doing this? To the public, the word was that the United States was helping to stop Communism in Asia, but there was not much public discussion. In the secret memoranda of the National Security Council (which advised the President on foreign policy) there was talk in 1950 of what came to be known as the \"domino theory\"\u2014that, like a row of dominoes, if one country fell to Communism, the next one would do the same and so on. It was important therefore to keep the first one from falling.\n\nA secret memo of the National Security Council in June 1952 also pointed to the chain of U.S. military bases along the coast of China, the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea:\n\nCommunist control of all of Southeast Asia would render the U.S. position in the Pacific offshore island chain precarious and would seriously jeopardize fundamental U.S. security interests in the Far East.\n\nAnd:\nSoutheast Asia, especially Malaya and Indonesia, is the principal world source of natural rubber and tin, and a producer of petroleum and other strategically important commodities. ...\n\nIt was also noted that Japan depended on the rice of Southeast Asia, and Communist victory there would \"make it extremely difficult to prevent Japan's eventual accommodation to communism.\"\n\nIn 1953, a congressional study mission reported: \"The area of Indochina is immensely wealthy in rice, rubber, coal and iron ore. Its position makes it a strategic key to the rest of Southeast Asia.\" That year, a State Department memorandum said that the French were losing the war in Indochina, had failed \"to win a sufficient native support,\" feared that a negotiated settlement \"would mean the eventual loss to Communism not only of Indo-China but of the whole of Southeast Asia,\" and concluded: \"If the French actually decided to withdraw, the U.S. would have to consider most seriously whether to take over in this area.\n\nIn 1954, the French, having been unable to win Vietnamese popular support, which was overwhelmingly behind Ho Chi Minh and the revolutionary movement, had to withdraw.\n\nAn international assemblage at Geneva presided over the peace agreement between the French and the Vietminh. It was agreed that the French would temporarily withdraw into the southern part of Vietnam, that the Vietminh would remain in the north, and that an election would take place in two years in a unified Vietnam to enable the Vietnamese to choose their own government.\n\nThe United States moved quickly to prevent the unification and to establish South Vietnam as an American sphere. It set up in Saigon as head of the government a former Vietnamese official named Ngo Dinh Diem, who had recently been living in New Jersey, and encouraged him not to hold the scheduled elections for unification. A memo in early 1954 of the joint Chiefs of Staff said that intelligence estimates showed \"a settlement based on free elections would be attended by almost certain loss of the Associated States [Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam-the three parts of Indochina created by the Geneva Conference] to Communist control.\" Diem again and again blocked the elections requested by the Vietminh, and with American money and arms his government became more and more firmly established. As the Pentagon Papers put it: \"South Viet Nam was essentially the creation of the United States.\"\n\nThe Diem regime became increasingly unpopular. Diem was a Catholic, and most Vietnamese were Buddhists; Diem was close to the landlords, and this was a country of peasants. His pretenses at land reform left things basically as they were. He replaced locally selected provincial chiefs with his own men, appointed in Saigon; by 1962, 88 percent of these provincial chiefs were military men. Diem imprisoned more and more Vietnamese who criticized the regime for corruption, for lack of reform.\n\nOpposition grew quickly in the countryside, where Diem's apparatus could not reach well, and around 1958 guerrilla activities began against the regime. The Communist regime in Hanoi gave aid, encouragement, and sent people south-most of them southerners who had gone north after the Geneva accords-to support the guerrilla movement. In 1960, the National Liberation Front was formed in the South. It united the various strands of opposition to the regime; its strength came from South Vietnamese peasants, who saw it as a way of changing their daily lives. A U.S. government analyst named Douglas Pike, in his book Viet Cong, based on interviews with rebels and captured documents, tried to give a realistic assessment of what the United States faced:\n\nIn the 2561 villages of South Vietnam, the National Liberation Front created a host of nation-wide socio-political organizations in a country where mass organizations . .. were virtually nonexistent... Aside from the NLF there had never been a truly mass-based political party in South Vietnam.\n\nPike wrote: \"The Communists have brought to the villages of South Vietnam significant social change and have done so largely by means of the communication process.\" That is, they were organizers much more than they were warriors. \"What struck me most forcibly about the NLF was its totality as a social revolution first and as a war second.\" Pike was impressed with the mass involvement of the peasants in the movement. \"The rural Vietnamese was not regarded simply as a pawn in a power struggle but as the active element in the thrust. He was the thrust.\" Pike wrote:\n\nThe purpose of this vast organizational effort was ... to restructure the social order of the village and train the villages to control themselves. This was the NLF's one undeviating thrust from the start. Not the killing of ARVN (Saigon) soldiers, not the occupation of real estate, not the preparation for some great pitched battle... but organization in depth of the rural population through the instrument of self-control.\n\nPike estimated that the NLF membership by early 1962 stood at around 300,000. The Pentagon Papers said of this period: \"Only the Viet Cong had any real support and influence on a broad base in the countryside.\"\n\nWhen Kennedy took office in early 1961 he continued the policies of Truman and Eisenhower in Southeast Asia. Almost immediately, he approved a secret plan for various military actions in Vietnam and Laos, including the \"dispatch of agents to North Vietnam\" to engage in \"sabotage and light harassment,\" according to the Pentagon Papers. Back in 1956, he had spoken of \"the amazing success of President Diem\" and said of Diem's Vietnam: \"Her political liberty is an inspiration.\"\nOne day in June 1963, a Buddhist monk sat down in the public square in Saigon and set himself afire. More Buddhist monks began committing suicide by fire to dramatize their opposition to the Diem regime. Diem's police raided the Buddhist pagodas and temples, wounded thirty monks, arrested 1,400 people , and closed down the pagodas. There were demonstrations in the city. The police fired, killing nine people . Then, in Hue, the ancient capital, ten thousand demonstrated in protest.\n\nUnder the Geneva Accords, the United States was permitted to have 685 military advisers in southern Vietnam. Eisenhower secretly sent several thousand. Under Kennedy, the figure rose to sixteen thousand, and some of them began to take part in combat operations. Diem was losing. Most of the South Vietnam countryside was now controlled by local villagers organized by the NLF.\n\nDiem was becoming an embarrassment, an obstacle to effective control over Vietnam. Some Vietnamese generals began plotting to overthrow his regime, staying in touch with a CTA man named Lucien Conein. Conein met secretly with American Ambassador Henry- Cabot Lodge, who was enthusiastically for the coup. Lodge reported to Kennedy's assistant, McGeorge Bundy, on October 25 (Pentagon Papers): \"I have personally approved each meeting between General Iran Van Don and Conein who has carried out my orders in each instance explicitly.\" Kennedy seemed hesitant, but no move was made to warn Diem. Indeed, just before the coup, and just after he had been in touch through Conein with the plotters, Lodge spent a weekend with Diem at a seaside resort. When, on November 1, 1963, the generals attacked the presidential palace, Diem phoned Ambassador Lodge, and the conversation went as follows:\n\nDiem: Some units have made a rebellion and I want to know what is the attitude of the United States?\nLodge: I do not feel well enough informed to be able to tell you. I have heard the shooting, but am not acquainted with all of the facts. Also it is 4:30 A.M. in Washington and the U.S. Government cannot possibly have a view.\nDiem: But you must have some general ideas. . ..\n\nLodge told Diem to phone him if he could do anything for his physical safety.\n\nThat was the last conversation any American had with Diem. He fled the palace, but he and his brother were apprehended by the plotters, taken out in a truck, and executed.\n\nEarlier in 1963, Kennedy's Undersecretary of State, U. Alexis Johnson, was speaking before the Economic Club of Detroit:\n\nWhat is the attraction that Southeast Asia has exerted for centuries on the great powers flanking it on all sides? Why is it desirable, and why is it important? First, it provides a lush climate, fertile soil, rich natural resources, a relatively sparse population in most areas, and room to expand. The countries of Southeast Asia produce rich exportable surpluses such as rice, rubber, teak, corn, tin, spices, oil, and many others. ...\n\nThis is not the language that was used by President Kennedy in his explanations to the American public. He talked of Communism and freedom. In a news conference February 14, 1962, he said; \"Yes, as you know, the U.S. for more than a decade has been assisting the government, the people of Vietnam, to maintain their independence.\"\n\nThree weeks after the execution of Diem, Kennedy himself was assassinated, and his Vice- President, Lyndon Johnson, took office.\n\nThe generals who succeeded Diem could not suppress the National Liberation Front. Again and again, American leaders expressed their bewilderment at the popularity of the NLF, at the high morale of its soldiers. The Pentagon historians wrote that when Eisenhower met with President- elect Kennedy in January 1961, he \"wondered aloud why, in interventions of this kind, we always seemed to find that the morale of the Communist forces was better than that of the democratic forces.\" And General Maxwell Taylor reported in late 1964:\n\nThe ability of the Viet-Cong continuously to rebuild their units and to make good their losses is one of the mysteries of the guerrilla war.. .. Not only do the Viet-Cong units have the recuperative powers of the phoenix, but they have an amazing ability to maintain morale. Only in rare cases have we found evidences of had morale among Viet-Cong prisoners or recorded in captured Viet- Cong documents.\n\nIn early August 1964, President Johnson used a murky set of events in the Gulf of Tonkin, off the coast of North Vietnam, to launch full-scale war on Vietnam. Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara told the American public there was an attack by North Vietnamese torpedo boats on American destroyers. \"While on routine patrol in international waters,\" McNamara said, \"the U.S. destroyer Maddox underwent an unprovoked attack.\" It later turned out that the Gulf of Tonkin episode was a fake, that the highest American officials had lied to the public-just as they had in the invasion of Cuba under Kennedy. In fact, the CIA had engaged in a secret operation attacking North Vietnamese coastal installations\u2014so if there had been an attack it would not have been \"unprovoked.\" It was not a \"routine patrol,\" because the Maddox was on a special electronic spying mission. And it was not in international waters but in Vietnamese territorial waters. It turned out that no torpedoes were fired at the Maddox, as McNamara said. Another reported attack on another destroyer, two nights later, which Johnson called \"open aggression on the high seas,\" seems also to have been an invention.\n\nAt the time of the incident, Secretary of State Rusk was questioned on NBC television:\n\nREPORTER: What explanation, then, can you come up with for this unprovoked attack?\nRUSK: Well, I haven't been able, quite frankly, to come to a fully satisfactory explanation. There is a great gulf of understanding, between that world and our world, ideological in character. They see what we think of as the real world in wholly different terms. Their very processes of logic are different. So that it's very difficult to enter into each other's minds across that great ideological gulf.\n\nThe Tonkin \"attack\" brought a congressional resolution, passed unanimously in the House, and with only two dissenting votes in the Senate, giving Johnson the power to take military action as he saw fit in Southeast Asia.\n\nTwo months before the Gulf of Tonkin incident, U.S. government leaders met in Honolulu and discussed such a resolution. Rusk said, in this meeting, according to the Pentagon Papers, that \"public opinion on our Southeast Asia policy was badly divided in the United States at the moment and that, therefore, the President needed an affirmation of support.\"\n\nThe Tonkin Resolution gave the President the power to initiate hostilities without the declaration of war by Congress that the Constitution required. The Supreme Court, supposed to be the watchdog of the Constitution, was asked by a number of petitioners in the course of the Vietnam war to declare the war unconstitutional. Again and again, it refused even to consider the issue.\n\nImmediately after the Tonkin affair, American warplanes began bombarding North Vietnam. During 1965, over 200,000 American soldiers were sent to South Vietnam, and in 1966, 200,000 more. By early 1968, there were more than 500,000 American troops there, and the U.S. Air Force was dropping bombs at a rate unequaled in history . Tiny glimmerings of the massive human suffering under this bombardment came to the outside world. On June 5, 1965, the New York Times carried a dispatch from Saigon:\n\nAs the Communists withdrew from Quangngai last Monday, United States jet bombers pounded the hills into which they were headed. Many Vietnamese\u2014one estimate is as high as 500\u2014were killed by the strikes. The American contention is that they were Vietcong soldiers. But three out of four patients seeking treatment in a Vietnamese hospital afterward for burns from napalm, or jellied gasoline, were village women.\n\nOn September 6, another press dispatch from Saigon:\n\nIn Bien Hoa province south of Saigon on August 15 United States aircraft accidentally bombed a Buddhist pagoda and a Catholic church ... it was the third time their pagoda had been bombed in 1965. A temple of the Cao Dai religious sect in the same area had been bombed twice this year.\n\nIn another delta province there is a woman who has both arms burned off by napalm and her eyelids so badly burned that she cannot close them. When it is time for her to sleep her family puts a blanket over her head. The woman had two of her children killed in the air strike that maimed her.\n\nFew Americans appreciate what their nation is doing to South Vietnam with airpower . . . innocent civilians are dying every day in South Vietnam.\n\nLarge areas of South Vietnam were declared \"free fire zones,\" which meant that all persons remaining within them-civilians, old people , children\u2014were considered an enemy, and bombs were dropped at will. Villages suspected of harboring Viet Cong were subject to \"search and destroy\" missions\u2014men of military age in the villages were killed, the homes were burned, the women, children, and old people were sent off to refugee camps. Jonathan Schell, in his book The Village of Ben Suc, describes such an operation: a village surrounded, attacked, a man riding on a bicycle shot down, three people picnicking by the river shot to death, the houses destroyed, the women, children, old people herded together, taken away from their ancestral homes.\n\nThe CIA in Vietnam, in a program called \"Operation Phoenix,\" secretly, without trial, executed at least twenty thousand civilians in South Vietnam who were suspected of being members of the Communist underground. A pro-administration analyst wrote in the journal Foreign Affairs in January 1975: \"Although the Phoenix program did undoubtedly kill or incarcerate many innocent civilians, it did also eliminate many members of the Communist infrastructure.\"\n\nAfter the war, the release of records of the International Red Cross showed that in South Vietnamese prison camps, where at the height of the war 65,000 to 70,000 people were held and often beaten and tortured, American advisers observed and sometimes participated. The Red Cross observers found continuing, systematic brutality at the two principal Vietnamese POW camps\u2014at Phu Quoc and Qui Nhon, where American advisers were stationed.\n\nBy the end of the Vietnam war, 7 million tons of bombs had been dropped on Vietnam, more than twice the total bombs dropped on Europe and Asia in World War II\u2014almost one 500-pound bomb for every human being in Vietnam. It was estimated that there were 20 million bomb craters in the country. In addition, poisonous sprays were dropped by planes to destroy trees and any kind of growth\u2014an area the size of the state of Massachusetts was covered with such poison. Vietnamese mothers reported birth defects in their children. Yale biologists, using the same poison (2,4,5,T) on mice, reported defective mice born and said they had no reason to believe the effect on humans was different.\n\nOn March 16, 1968, a company of American soldiers went into the hamlet of My Lai 4, in Quang Ngai province. They rounded up the inhabitants, including old people and women with infants in their arms. These people were ordered into a ditch, where they were methodically shot to death by American soldiers. The testimony of James Dursi, a rifleman, at the later trial of Lieutenant William Calley, was reported in the New York Times:\n\nLieutenant Calley and a weeping rifleman named Paul D. Meadlo\u2014the same soldier who had fed candy to the children before shooting them\u2014pushed the prisoners into the ditch....\n\n\"There was an order to shoot by Lieutenant Calley, I can't remember the exact words-it was something like 'Start firing.'\n\n\"Meadlo turned to me and said: 'Shoot, why don't you shoot?'\n\n\"I was crying. \"I said, 'I can't. I won't.'\n\n\"Then Lieutenant Calley and Meadlo pointed their rifles into the ditch and fired.\n\n\"People were diving on top of each other; mothers were trying to protect their children. .. .\"\n\nJournalist Seymour Hersh, in his book My Lai 4, writes:\n\nWhen Army investigators reached the barren area in November, 1969, in connection with the My Lai probe in the United States, they found mass graves at three sites, as well as a ditch full of bodies. It was estimated that between 450 and 500 people -most of them women, children and old men-had been slain and buried there.\n\nThe army tried to cover up what happened. But a letter began circulating from a GI named Ron Ridenhour, who had heard about the massacre. There were photos taken of the killing by an army photographer, Ronald Haeberle. Seymour Hersh, then working for an antiwar news agency in Southeast Asia called Dispatch News Service, wrote about it. The story of the massacre had appeared in May 196B in two French publications, one called Sud Vietnam en Lutte, and another published by the North Vietnamese delegation to the peace talks in Paris-but the American press did not pay any attention.\n\nSeveral of the officers in the My Lai massacre were put on trial, but only Lieutenant William Calley was found guilty. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but his sentence was reduced twice; he served three years-Nixon ordered that he be under house arrest rather than a regular prison-and then was paroled. Thousands of Americans came to his defense. Part of it was in patriotic justification of his action as necessary against the \"Communists.\" Part of it seems to have been a feeling that he was unjustly singled out in a war with many similar atrocities. Colonel Oran Henderson, who had been charged with covering up the My Lai killings, told reporters in early 1971: \"Every unit of brigade size has its My Lai hidden someplace.\"\n\nIndeed, My Lai was unique only in its details. Hersh reported a letter sent by a GI to his family, and published in a local newspaper:\n\nDear Mom and Dad:\n\nToday we went on a mission and I am not very proud of myself, my friends, or my country. We burned every hut in sight!\n\nIt was a small rural network of villages and the people were incredibly poor. My unit burned and plundered their meager possessions. Let me try to explain the situation to you.\n\nThe huts here are thatched palm leaves. Each one has a dried mud bunker inside. These bunkers are to protect the families. Kind of like air raid shelters.\n\nMy unit commanders, however, chose to think that these bunkers are offensive, So every hut we find that has a bunker we are ordered to burn to the ground.\n\nWhen the ten helicopters landed this morning, in the midst of these huts, and six men jumped out of each \"chopper\", we were firing the moment we hit the ground. We fired into all the huts we could...\n\nIt is then that we burned these huts. . . . Everyone is crying, begging and praying that we don't separate them and take their husbands and fathers, sons and grandfathers. The women wail and moan.\n\nThen they watch in terror as we burn their homes, personal possessions and food. Yes, we burn all rice and shoot all livestock.\n\nThe more unpopular became the Saigon government, the more desperate the military effort became to make up for this. A secret congressional report of late 1967 said the Viet Gong were distributing about five times more land to the peasants than the South Vietnamese government, whose land distribution program had come \"to a virtual standstill.\" The report said: \"The Viet Cong have eliminated landlord domination and reallocated lands owned by absentee landlords and the G.V.N. [Government of Viet Nam] to the landless and others who cooperate with Viet Cong authorities.\"\n\nThe unpopularity of the Saigon government explains the success of the National Liberation Front in infiltrating Saigon and other government-held towns in early 1968, without the people there warning the government. The NLF thus launched a surprise offensive (it was the time of \"Tet,\" their New Year holiday) that carried them into the heart of Saigon, immobilized Tan San Nhut airfield, even occupied the American Embassy briefly. The offensive was beaten back, but it demonstrated that all the enormous firepower delivered on Vietnam by the United States had not destroyed the NLF, its morale, its popular support, its will to fight. It caused a reassessment in the American government, more doubts among the American people .\n\nThe massacre at My Lai by a company of ordinary soldiers was a small event compared with the plans of high-level military and civilian leaders to visit massive destruction on the civilian population of Vietnam, Assistant Secretary of Defense John McNaughton in early 1966, seeing that large-scale bombing of North Vietnam villages was not producing the desired result, suggested a different strategy. The air strikes on villages, he said, would \"create a counterproductive wave of revulsion abroad and at home.\" He suggested instead:\n\nDestruction of locks and dams, however\u2014if handled right-might... offer promise. It should be studied. Such destruction doesn't kill or drown people . By shallow-flooding the rice, it leads after a time to widespread starvation (more than a million?) unless food is provided\u2014which we could offer to do \"at the conference table.\" ...\n\nThe heavy bombings were intended to destroy the will of ordinary Vietnamese to resist, as in the bombings of German and Japanese population centers in World War II\u2014despite President Johnson's public insistence that only \"military targets\" were being bombed. The government was using language like \"one more turn of the screw\" to describe bombing. The CIA at one point in 1966 recommended a \"bombing program of greater intensify,\" according to the Pentagon Papers, directed against, in the CIA;S words, \"the will of the regime as a target system.\"\n\nMeanwhile, just across the border of Vietnam, in a neighboring country, Laos, where a right-wing government installed by the CIA faced a rebellion, one of the most beautiful areas in the world, the Plain of Jars, was being destroyed by bombing. This was not reported by the government or the press, but an American who lived in Laos, Fred Branfman, told the story in his book Voices from the Plain of Jars:\n\nOver 25,000 attack sorties were flown against the Plain of Jars from May, 1964, through September, 1969; over. 75,000 tons of bombs were dropped on it; on the ground, thousands were killed and wounded, tens of thousands driven underground, and the entire aboveground society leveled.\n\nBranfman, who spoke the Laotian language and lived in a village with a Laotian family, interviewed hundreds of refugees from the bombing who poured into the capital city of Vientiane. He recorded their statements and preserved their drawings. A twenty-six-year-old nurse from Xieng Khouang told of her life in her village:\n\nI was at one with the earth, the air, the upland fields, the paddy and the seedbeds of my village. Each day and night in the light of the moon I and my friends from the village would wander, calling out and singing, through forest and field, amidst the cries of the birds. During the harvesting and planting season, we would sweat and labor together, under the sun and the rain, contending with poverty and miserable conditions, continuing the farmer's life which has been the profession of our ancestors.\n\nBut in 1964 and 1965 I could feel the trembling of the earth and the shock from the sounds of arms exploding around my village. I began to hear the noise of airplanes, circling about in the heavens. One of them would stick its head down and, plunging earthward, loose a loud roar, shocking the heart as light and smoke covered everything so that one could not see anything at all. Each day we would exchange news with the neighboring villagers of the bombings that had occurred: the damaged houses, the injured and the dead....\n\nThe holes! The holes! During that time we needed holes to save our lives. We who were young took our sweat and our strength, which should have been spent raising food in the rice fields and forests to sustain our lives, and squandered it digging holes to protect ourselves... .\n\nOne young woman explained why the revolutionary movement in Laos, the Neo Lao, attracted her and so many of her friends:\n\nAs a young girl, I had found that the past had not been very good, for men had mistreated and made fun of women as the weaker sex. But after the Neo Lao party began to administer the region ... it became very different ... under the Neo Lao things changed psychologically, such as their teaching that women should be as brave as men. For example: although I had gone to school before, my elders advised me not to. They had said that it would not be useful for me as I could not hope to be a high ranking official after graduation, that only the children of the elite or rich could expect that.\n\nBut the Neo Lao said that women should have the same education as men, and they gave us equal privileges and did not allow anyone to make fun of us....\n\nAnd the old associations were changed into new ones. For example, most of the new teachers and doctors trained were women. And they changed the lives of the very poor... . For they shared the land of those who had many rice fields with those who had none.\n\nA seventeen-year-old boy told about the Pathet Lao revolutionary army coming to his village:\n\nSome people were afraid, mostly those with money. They offered cows to the Pathet Lao soldiers to eat, but the soldiers refused to take them. If they did take them, they paid a suitable price. The truth is that they led the people not to be afraid of anything.\n\nThen they organized the election of village and canton chief, and the people were the ones who chose them. .. .\n\nDesperation led the CIA to enlist the Hmong tribesmen in military campaigns, which led to the deaths of thousands of Hmong. This was accompanied by secrecy and lying, as was so much of what happened in Laos. In September 1973, a former government official in Laos, Jerome Doolittle, wrote in the New York Times:\n\nThe Pentagon's most recent lies about bombing Cambodia bring back a question that often occurred to me when I was press attache at the American Embassy in Vientiane, Laos.\n\nWhy did we bother to lie?\n\nWhen I first arrived in Laos, I was instructed to answer all press questions about our massive and merciless bombing campaign in that tiny country with: \"At the request of the Royal Laotian Government, the United States is conducting unarmed reconnaissance flights accompanied by armed escorts who have the right to return if fired upon.\"\n\nThis was a lie. Every reporter to whom I told it knew it was a lie. Hanoi knew it was a lie. The International Control Commission knew it was a lie. Every interested Congressman and newspaper reader knew it was a lie.. . .\n\nAfter all, the lies did serve to keep something from somebody, and the somebody was us.\n\nBy early 1968, the cruelty of the war began touching the conscience of many Americans. For many others, the problem was that the United States was unable to win the war, while 40,000 American soldiers were dead by this time, 250,000 wounded, with no end in sight. (The Vietnam casualties were many times this number.)\n\nLyndon Johnson had escalated a brutal war and failed to win it. His popularity was at an all-time low; he could not appear publicly without a demonstration against him and the war. The chant \"LBJ, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?\" was heard in demonstrations throughout the country. In the spring of 1968 Johnson announced he would not run again for President, and that negotiations for peace would begin with the Vietnamese in Paris.\n\nIn the fall of 1968, Richard Nixon, pledging that he would get the United States out of Vietnam, was elected President. He began to withdraw troops; by February 1972, less than 150,000 were left. But the bombing continued. Nixon's policy was \"Vietnamization\"\u2014the Saigon government, with Vietnamese ground troops, using American money and air power, would carry on the war. Nixon was not ending the war; he was ending the most unpopular aspect of it, the involvement of American soldiers on the soil of a faraway country.\n\nIn the spring of 1970, Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger launched an invasion of Cambodia, after a long bombardment that the government never disclosed to the public. The invasion not only led to an outcry of protest in the United States, it was a military failure, and Congress resolved that Nixon could not use American troops in extending the war without congressional approval. The following year, without American troops, the United States supported a South Vietnamese invasion of Laos. This too failed. In 1971, 800,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the United States on Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam. Meantime, the Saigon military regime, headed by President Nguyen Van Thieu, the last of a long succession of Saigon chiefs of state, was keeping thousands of opponents in jail.\n\nSome of the first signs of opposition in the United States to the Vietnam war came out of the civil rights movement-perhaps because the experience of black people with the government led them to distrust any claim that it was fighting for freedom. On the very day that Lyndon Johnson was telling the nation in early August 1964 about the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and announcing the bombing of North Vietnam, black and white activists were gathering near Philadelphia, Mississippi, at a memorial service for the three civil rights workers killed there that summer. One of the speakers pointed bitterly to Johnson's use of force in Asia, comparing it with the violence used against blacks in Mississippi.\n\nIn mid-1965, in McComb, Mississippi, young blacks who had just learned that a classmate of theirs was killed in Vietnam distributed a leaflet:\n\nNo Mississippi Negroes should be fighting in Viet Nam for the White man's freedom, until all the Negro People are free in Mississippi.\n\nNegro boys should not honor the draft here in Mississippi. Mothers should encourage their sons not to go. ...\n\nNo one has a right to ask us to risk our lives and kill other Colored People in Santo Domingo and Viet Nam, so that the White American can get richer.\n\nWhen Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara visited Mississippi and praised Senator John Stennis, a prominent racist, as a \"man of very genuine greatness,\" white and black students marched in protest, with placards saying \"In Memory of the Burned Children of Vietnam.\"\n\nThe Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee declared in early 1966 that \"the United States is pursuing an aggressive policy in violation of international law\" and called for withdrawal from Vietnam. That summer, six members of SNCC were arrested for an invasion of an induction center in Atlanta. They were convicted and sentenced to several years in prison. Around the same time, Julian Bond, a SNCC activist who had just been elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, spoke out against the war and the draft, and the House voted that he not be seated because his statements violated the Selective Service Act and \"tend to bring discredit to the House.\" The Supreme Court restored Bond to his seat, saying he had the right to free expression under the First Amendment.\n\nOne of the great sports figures of the nation, Muhammad Ali, the black boxer and heavyweight champion, refused to serve in what he called a \"white man's war\"; boxing authorities took away his title as champion. Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke out in 1967 at Riverside Church in New York:\n\nSomehow this madness must cease. We must stop now. I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam. I speak for those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being destroyed, whose culture is being subverted. I speak for the poor of America who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home and death and corruption in Vietnam. I speak as a citizen of the world, for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken. I speak as an American to the leaders of my own nation. The great initiative in this war is ours. The initiative to stop it must be ours.\n\nYoung men began to refuse to register for the draft, refused to be inducted if called. As early as May 1964 the slogan \"We Won't Go\" was widely publicized. Some who had registered began publicly burning their draft cards to protest the war. One, David O'Brien, burned his draft card in South Boston; he was convicted, and the Supreme Court overruled his argument that tins was a protected form of free expression. In October of 1967 there were organized draft-card \"turn-ins\" all over the country; in San Francisco alone, three hundred draft cards were returned to the government. Just before a huge demonstration at the Pentagon that month, a sack of collected draft cards was presented to the Justice Department.\n\nBy mid-1965, 380 prosecutions were begun against men refusing to be inducted; by mid-1968 that figure was up to 3,305. At the end of 1969, there were 33,960 delinquents nationwide.\n\nIn May 1969 the Oakland induction center, where draftees reported from all of northern California, reported that of 4,400 men ordered to report for induction, 2,400 did not show up. In the first quarter of 1970 the Selective Service system, for the first time, could not meet its quota.\n\nA Boston University graduate student in history, Philip Supina, wrote on May 1, 1968, to his draft board in Tucson, Arizona:\n\nI am enclosing the order for me to report for my pre-induction physical exam for the armed forces. I have absolutely no intention to report for that exam, or for induction, or to aid in any way the American war effort against the people of Vietnam...\n\nHe ended his letter by quoting the Spanish philosopher Miguel Unamuno, who during the Spanish Civil War said: \"Sometimes to be Silent is to Lie.\" Supina was convicted and sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nEarly in the war, there had been two separate incidents, barely noticed by most Americans. On November 2, 1965, in front of the Pentagon in Washington, as thousands of employees were streaming out of the building in the late afternoon, Norman Morrison, a thirty-two-year-old pacifist, father of three, stood below the third-floor windows of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, doused himself with kerosene, and set himself afire, giving up his life in protest against the war. Also that year, in Detroit, an eighty-two-year-old woman named Alice Herz burned herself to death to make a statement against the horror of Indochina.\n\nA remarkable change in sentiment took place. In early 1965, when the bombing of North Vietnam began, a hundred people gathered on the Boston Common to voice their indignation. On October 15, 1969, the number of people assembled on the Boston Common to protest the war was 100,000. Perhaps 2 million people across the nation gathered that day in towns and villages that had never seen an antiwar meeting.\n\nIn the summer of 1965, a few hundred people had gathered in Washington to march in protest against the war: the first in line, historian Staughton Lynd, SNCC organizer Bob Moses, and long- time pacifist David Dellinger, were splattered with red paint by hecklers. But by 1970, the Washington peace rallies were drawing hundreds of thousands of people . In 1971, twenty thousand came to Washington to commit civil disobedience, trying to tie up Washington traffic to express their revulsion against the killing still going on in Vietnam. Fourteen thousand of them were arrested, the largest mass arrest in American history .\n\nHundreds of volunteers in the Peace Corps spoke out against the war. In Chile, ninety-two volunteers defied the Peace Corps director and issued a circular denouncing the war. Eight hundred former members of the Corps issued a statement of protest against what was happening in Vietnam.\n\nThe poet Robert Lowell, invited to a White House function, refused to come. Arthur Miller, also invited, sent a telegram to the White House: \"When the guns boom, the arts die.\" Singer Eartha Kitt was invited to a luncheon on the White House lawn and shocked all those present by speaking out, in the presence of the President's wife, against the war. A teenager, called to the White House to accept a prize, came and criticized the war. In Hollywood, local artists erected a 60-foot Tower of Protest on Sunset Boulevard. At the National Book Award ceremonies in New York, fifty authors and publishers walked out on a speech by Vice-President Humphrey in a display of anger at his role in the war.\n\nIn London, two young Americans gate-crashed the American ambassador's elegant Fourth of July reception and called out a toast: \"To all the dead and dying in Vietnam.\" They were carried out by guards. In the Pacific Ocean, two young American seamen hijacked an American munitions ship to divert its load of bombs from airbases in Thailand. For four days they took command of the ship and its crew, taking amphetamine pills to stay awake until the ship reached Cambodian waters. The Associated Press reported in late 1972, from \"York, Pennsylvania: \"Five antiwar activists were arrested by the state police today for allegedly sabotaging railroad equipment near a factory that makes bomb casings used in the Vietnam war.\"\n\nMiddle-class and professional people unaccustomed to activism began to speak up. In May 1970, the New York Times reported from Washington: \"1000 'ESTABLISHMENT' LAWYERS JOIN WAR PROTEST.\" Corporations began to wonder whether the war was going to hurt their long- range business interests; the Wall Street Journal began criticizing the continuation of the war. As the war became more and more unpopular, people in or close to the government began to break out of the circle of assent. The most dramatic instance was the case of Daniel Ellsberg.\n\nEllsberg was a Harvard-trained economist, a former marine officer, employed by the RAND Corporation, which did special, often secret research for the U.S. government. Ellsberg helped write the Department of Defense history of the war in Vietnam, and then decided to make the top- secret document public, with the aid of his friend, Anthony Russo, a former RAND Corporation man. The two had met in Saigon, where both had been affected, in different experiences, by direct sight of the war, and had become powerfully indignant at what the United States was doing to the people of Vietnam.\n\nEllsberg and Russo spent night after night, after hours, at a friend's advertising agency, duplicating the 7,000-page document. Then Ellsberg gave copies to various Congressmen and to the New York Times. In June 1971 the Times began printing selections from what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers. It created a national sensation.\n\nThe Nixon administration tried to get the Supreme Court to stop further publication, but the Court said this was \"prior restraint\" of the freedom of the press and thus unconstitutional The government then indicted Ellsberg and Russo for violating the Espionage Act by releasing classified documents to unauthorized people ; they faced long terms in prison if convicted. The judge, however, called off the trial during the jury deliberations, because the Watergate events unfolding at the time revealed unfair practices by the prosecution.\n\nEllsberg, by his bold act, had broken with the usual tactic of dissidents inside the government who bided their time and kept their opinions to themselves, hoping for small changes in policy. A colleague urged him not to leave the government because there he had \"access,\" saying, \"Don't cut yourself off. Don't cut your throat.\" Ellsberg replied: \"Life exists outside the Executive Branch.\"\n\nThe antiwar movement, early in its growth, found a strange, new constituency: priests and nuns of the Catholic Church. Some of them had been aroused by the civil rights movement, others by their experiences in Latin America, where they saw poverty and injustice under governments supported by the United States. In the fall of 1967, Father Philip Berrigan (a Josephite priest who was a veteran of World War II), joined by artist Tom Lewis and friends David Eberhardt and James Mengel, went to the office of a draft board in Baltimore, Maryland, drenched the draft records with blood, and waited to be arrested. They were put on trial and sentenced to prison terms of two to six years.\n\nThe following May, Philip Berrigan-out on bail in the Baltimore case-was joined in a second action by his brother Daniel, a Jesuit priest who had visited North Vietnam and seen the effects of U.S. bombing. They and seven other people went into a draft board office in Catonsville, Maryland, removed records, and set them afire outside in the presence of reporters and onlookers. They were convicted and sentenced to prison, and became famous as the \"Catonsville Nine.\" Dan Berrigan wrote a \"Meditation\" at the time of the Catonsville incident:\n\nOur apologies, good friends, for the fracture of good order, the burning of paper instead of children, the angering of the orderlies in the front parlor of the charnel house. We could not, so help us God, do otherwise.... We say: killing is disorder, life and gentleness and community and unselfishness is the only order we recognize. For the sake of that order, we risk our liberty, our good name. The time is past when good men can remain silent, when obedience can segregate men from public risk, when the poor can die without defense.\n\nWhen his appeals had been exhausted, and he was supposed to go to prison, Daniel Berrigan disappeared. While the FBI searched for him, he showed up at an Easter festival at Cornell University, where he had been teaching. With dozens of FBI men looking for him in the crowd, he suddenly appeared on stage. Then the lights went out, he hid inside a giant figure of the Bread and Puppet Theatre which was on stage, was carried out to a truck, and escaped to a nearby farmhouse. He stayed underground for four months, writing poems, issuing statements, giving secret interviews, appearing suddenly in a Philadelphia church to give a sermon and then disappearing again, baffling the FBI, until an informer's interception of a letter disclosed his whereabouts and he was captured and imprisoned.\n\nThe one woman among the Catonsville Nine, Mary Moylan, a former nun, also refused to surrender to the FBI. She was never found. Writing from underground, she reflected on her experience and how she came to it:\n\n... We had all known we were going to jail, so we all had our toothbrushes. I was just exhausted. I took my little box of clothes and stuck it under the cot and climbed into bed. Now all the women in the Baltimore County jail were black-I think there was only one white. The women were waking me up and saying, \"Aren't you going to cry?\" I said, \"What about?\" They said, \"You're in jail.\" And I said, \"Yeah, I knew I'd be here.\" . ..\n\nI was sleeping between two of these women, and every morning I'd wake up and they'd be leaning on their elbows watching me. They'd say, \"You slept all night.\" And they couldn't believe it. They were good. We had good times...\n\nI suppose the political turning point in my life came while I was in Uganda. I was there when American planes were bombing the Congo, and we were very close to the Congo border. The planes came over and bombed two villages in Uganda.. . . Where the hell did the American planes come in?\n\nLater I was in Dar Es Salaam and Chou En-lai came to town. The American Embassy sent out letters saying that no Americans were to be on the street, because this was a dirty Communist leader; but I decided this was a man who was making history and I wanted to see him... .\n\nWhen I came home from Africa I moved to Washington, and had to deal with the scene there and the insanity and brutality of the cops and the type of life that was led by most of the citizens of that city\u201470 percent black. ...\n\nAnd then Vietnam, and the napalm and the defoliants, and the bombings. ...\n\nI got involved with the women's movement about a year ago.. . .\n\nAt the time of Catonsville, going to jail made sense to me, partially because of the black scene-so many blacks forever filling the jails.. .. I don't think it's a valid tactic anymore.... I don't want to see people marching off to jail with smiles on their faces. I just don't want them going. The Seventies are going to be very difficult, and I don't want to waste the sisters and brothers we have by marching them off to jail and having mystical experiences or whatever they're going to have... .\n\nThe effect of the war and of the bold action of some priests and nuns was to crack the traditional conservatism of the Catholic community. On Moratorium Day 1969, at the Newton College of the Sacred Heart near Boston, a sanctuary of bucolic quiet and political silence, the great front door of the college displayed a huge painted red fist. At Boston College, a Catholic institution, six thousand people gathered that evening in the gymnasium to denounce the war.\n\nStudents were heavily involved in the early protests against the war. A survey by the Urban Research Corporation, for the first six months of 1969 only, and for only 232 of the nations two thousand institutions of higher education, showed that at least 215,000 students had participated in campus protests, that 3,652 had been arrested, that 956 had been suspended or expelled. Even in the high schools, in the late sixties, there were five hundred underground newspapers. At the Brown University commencement in 1969, two-thirds of the graduating class turned their backs when Henry Kissinger stood up to address them.\n\nThe climax of protest came in the spring of 1970 when President Nixon ordered the invasion of Cambodia. At Kent State University in Ohio, on May 4, when students gathered to demonstrate against the war, National Guardsmen fired into the crowd. Four students were killed. One was paralyzed for life. Students at four hundred colleges and universities went on strike in protest. It was the first general student strike in the history of the United States. During that school year of 1969-1970, the FBI listed 1,785 student demonstrations, including the occupation of 313 buildings.\n\nThe commencement day ceremonies after the Kent State killings were unlike any the nation had ever seen. From Amherst, Massachusetts, came this newspaper report:\n\nThe 100th Commencement of the University of Massachusetts yesterday was a protest, a call for peace.\n\nThe roll of the funeral drum set the beat for 2600 young men and women marching \"in fear, in despair and in frustration.\"\n\nRed fists of protest, white peace symbols, and blue doves were stenciled on black academic gowns, and nearly every other senior wore an armband representing a plea for peace.\n\nStudent protests against the ROTC (Reserve Officers Training Program) resulted in the canceling of those programs in over forty colleges and universities. In 1966, 191,749 college students enrolled in ROTC. By 1973, the number was 72,459. The ROTC was depended on to supply half the officers in Vietnam. In September 1973, for the sixth straight month, the ROTC could not fulfill its quota. One army official said: \"I just hope we don't get into another war, because if we do, I doubt we could fight it.\"\n\nThe publicity given to the student protests created the impression that the opposition to the war came mostly from middle-class intellectuals. When some construction workers in New York attacked student demonstrators, the news was played up in the national media. However, a number of elections in American cities, including those where mostly blue-collar workers lived, showed that antiwar sentiment was strong in the working classes. For instance, in Dearborn, Michigan, an automobile manufacturing town, a poll as early as 1967 showed 41 percent of the population favored withdrawal from the Vietnam war. In 1970, in two counties in California where petitioners placed the issue on the ballot\u2014San Francisco County and Marin County\u2014referenda asking withdrawal of the U.S. forces from Vietnam received a majority vote.\n\nIn late 1970, when a Gallup poll presented the statement: \"The United States should withdraw all troops from Vietnam by the end of next year,\" 65 percent of those questioned said, \"Yes.\" In Madison, Wisconsin, in the spring of 1971, a resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Southeast Asia won by 31,000 to 16,000 (in 1968 such a resolution had lost).\n\nBut the most surprising data were in a survey made by the University of Michigan. This showed that, throughout the Vietnam war, Americans with only a grade school education were much stronger for withdrawal from the war than Americans with a college education. In June 1966, of people with a college education, 27 percent were for immediate withdrawal from Vietnam; of people with only a grade school education, 41 percent were for immediate withdrawal. By September 1970, both groups were more antiwar: 47 percent of the college-educated were for withdrawal, and 61 percent of grade school graduates.\n\nThere is more evidence of the same kind. In an article in the American Sociological Review (June 1968), Richard F. Hamilton found in his survey of public opinion: \"Preferences for 'tough' policy alternatives are most frequent among the following groups, the highly educated, high status occupations, those with high incomes, younger persons, and those paying much attention to newspapers and magazines.\" And a political scientist, Harlan Hahn, doing a study of various city referenda on Vietnam, found support for withdrawal from Vietnam highest in groups of lower socioeconomic status. He also found that the regular polls, based on samplings, underestimated the opposition to the war among lower-class people .\n\nAll this was part of a general change in the entire population of the country. In August of 1965, 61 percent of the population thought the American involvement in Vietnam was not wrong. By May 1971 it was exactly reversed; 61 percent thought our involvement was wrong. Bruce Andrews, a Harvard student of public opinion, found that the people most opposed to the war were people over fifty, blacks, and women. He also noted that a study in the spring of 1964, when Vietnam was a minor issue in the newspapers, showed that 53 percent of college-educated people were willing to send troops to Vietnam, but only 33 percent of grade school-educated people were so willing.\n\nIt seems that the media, themselves controlled by higher-education, higher-income people who were more aggressive in foreign policy, tended to give the erroneous impression that working-class people were superpatriots for the war. Lewis Lipsitz, in a mid-1968 survey of poor blacks and whites in the South, paraphrased an attitude he found typical: \"The only way to help the poor man is to get out of that war in Vietnam. . .. These taxes\u2014high taxes\u2014it's going over yonder to kill people with and I don't see no cause in it.\"\n\nThe capacity for independent judgement among ordinary Americans is probably best shown by the swift development of antiwar feeling among American GIs-volunteers and draftees who came mostly from lower-income groups. There had been, earlier in American history , instances of soldiers' disaffection from the war: isolated mutinies in the Revolutionary War, refusal of reenlistment in the midst of hostilities in the Mexican war, desertion and conscientious objection in World War I and World War II. But Vietnam produced opposition by soldiers and veterans on a scale, and with a fervor, never seen before.\n\nIt began with isolated protests. As early as June 1965, Richard Steinke, a West Point graduate in Vietnam, refused to board an aircraft taking him to a remote Vietnamese village. \"The Vietnamese war,\" he said, \"is not worth a single American life.\" Steinke was court-martialed and dismissed from the service. The following year, three army privates, one black, one Puerto Rican, one Lithuanian-Italian-all poor-refused to embark for Vietnam, denouncing the war as \"immoral, illegal, and unjust.\" They were court-martialed and imprisoned.\n\nIn early 1967, Captain Howard Levy, an army doctor at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, refused to teach Green Berets, a Special Forces elite in the military. He said they were \"murderers of women and children\" and \"killers of peasants.\" He was court-martialed on the grounds that he was trying to promote disaffection among enlisted men by his statements. The colonel who presided at the trial said: \"The truth of the statements is not an issue in this case.\" Levy was convicted and sentenced to prison.\n\nThe individual acts multiplied: A black private in Oakland refused to board a troop plane to Vietnam, although he faced eleven years at hard labor. A navy nurse, Lieutenant Susan Schnall, was court-martialed for marching in a peace demonstration while in uniform, and for dropping antiwar leaflets from a plane on navy installations. In Norfolk, Virginia, a sailor refused to train fighter pilots because he said the war was immoral. An army lieutenant was arrested in Washington, D.C., in early 1968 for picketing the White House with a sign that said: \"120,000 American Casualties-Why?\" Two black marines, George Daniels and William Harvey, were given long prison sentences (Daniels, six years, Harvey, ten years, both later reduced) for talking to other black marines against the war.\n\nAs the war went on, desertions from the armed forces mounted. Thousands went to Western Europe\u2014France, Sweden, Holland. Most deserters crossed into Canada; some estimates were 50,000, others 100,000. Some stayed in the United States. A few openly defied the military authorities by taking \"sanctuary\" in churches, where, surrounded by antiwar friends and sympathizers, they waited for capture and court-martial. At Boston University, a thousand students kept vigil for five days and nights in the chapel, supporting an eighteen-year-old deserter, Ray Kroll.\n\nKroll's story was a common one. He had been inveigled into joining the army; he came from a poor family, was brought into court, charged with drunkenness, and given the choice of prison or enlistment. He enlisted. And then he began to think about the nature of the war.\n\nOn a Sunday morning, federal agents showed up at the Boston University chapel, stomped their way through aisles clogged with students, smashed down doors, and took Kroll away. From the stockade, he wrote back to friends: \"I ain't gonna kill; it's against my will. ...\" A friend he had made at the chapel brought him hooks, and he noted a saying he had found in one of them: \"What we have done will not be lost to all Eternity. Everything ripens at its time and becomes fruit at its hour.\"\n\nThe GI antiwar movement became more organized. Near Fort Jackson, South Carolina, the first \"GT coffeehouse\" was set up, a place where soldiers could get coffee and doughnuts, find antiwar literature, and talk freely with others. It was called the UFO, and lasted for several years before it was declared a \"public nuisance\" and closed by court action. But other GI coffeehouses sprang up in half a dozen other places across the country. An antiwar \"bookstore\" was opened near Fort Devens, Massachusetts, and another one at the Newport, Rhode Island, naval base.\n\nUnderground newspapers sprang up at military bases across the country; by 1970 more than fifty were circulating. Among them: About Face in Los Angeles; Fed Up! in Tacoma, Washington; Short Times at Fort Jackson; Vietnam GI in Chicago; Graffiti in Heidelberg, Germany; Bragg Briefs in North Carolina; Last Harass at Fort Gordon, Georgia; Helping Hand at Mountain Home Air Base, Idaho. These newspapers printed antiwar articles, gave news about the harassment of GIs and practical advice on the legal rights of servicemen, told how to resist military domination.\n\nMixed with feeling against the war was resentment at the cruelty, the dehumanization, of military life. In the army prisons, the stockades, this was especially true. In 1968, at the Presidio stockade in California, a guard shot to death an emotionally disturbed prisoner for walking away from a work detail. Twenty-seven prisoners then sat down and refused to work, singing \"We Shall Overcome.\" They were court-martialed, found guilty of mutiny, and sentenced to terms of up to fourteen years, later reduced after much public attention and protest.\n\nThe dissidence spread to the war front itself. When the great Moratorium Day demonstrations were taking place in October 1969 in the United States, some GIs in Vietnam wore black armbands to show their support. A news photographer reported that in a platoon on patrol near Da Nang, about half of the men were wearing black armbands. One soldier stationed at Cu Chi wrote to a friend on October 26, 1970, that separate companies had been set up for men refusing to go into the field to fight. \"It's no big thing here anymore to refuse to go.\" The French newspaper Le Monde reported that in four months, 109 soldiers of the first air cavalry division were charged with refusal to fight. \"A common sight,\" the correspondent for Le Monde wrote, \"is the black soldier, with his left fist clenched in defiance of a war he has never considered his own.\"\n\nWallace Terry, a black American reporter for Time magazine, taped conversations with hundreds of black soldiers; he found bitterness against army racism, disgust with the war, generally low morale. More and more cases of \"fragging\" were reported in Vietnam\u2014incidents where servicemen rolled fragmentation bombs under the tents of officers who were ordering them into combat, or against whom they had other grievances. The Pentagon reported 209 fraggings in Vietnam in 1970 alone.\n\nVeterans back from Vietnam formed a group called Vietnam Veterans Against the War. In December 1970, hundreds of them went to Detroit to what was called the \"Winter Soldier\" investigations, to testify publicly about atrocities they had participated in or seen in Vietnam, committed by Americans against Vietnamese. In April 1971 more than a thousand of them went to Washington, D.C., to demonstrate against the war. One by one, they went up to a wire fence around the Capitol, threw over the fence the medals they had won in Vietnam, and made brief statements about the war, sometimes emotionally, sometimes in icy, bitter calm.\n\nIn the summer of 1970, twenty-eight commissioned officers of the military, including some veterans of Vietnam, saying they represented about 250 other officers, announced formation of the Concerned Officers Movement against the war. During the fierce bombings of Hanoi and Haiphong, around Christmas 1972, came the first defiance of B-52 pilots who refused to fly those missions.\n\nOn June 3, 1973, the New York Times reported dropouts among West Point cadets. Officials there, the reporter wrote, \"linked the rate to an affluent, less disciplined, skeptical, and questioning generation and to the anti-military mood that a small radical minority and the Vietnam war had created.\"\n\nBut most of the antiwar action came from ordinary GIs, and most of these came from lower-income groups\u2014white, black, Native American, Chinese, and Chicano. (Chicanos back home were demonstrating by the thousands against the war.)\n\nA twenty-year-old New York City Chinese- American named Sam Choy enlisted at seventeen in the army, was sent to Vietnam, was made a cook, and found himself the target of abuse by fellow GIs, who called him \"Chink\" and \"gook\" (the term for the Vietnamese) and said he looked like the enemy. One day he took a rifle and fired warning shots at his tormenters. \"By this time I was near the perimeter of the base and was thinking of joining the Viet Cong; at least they would trust me.\"\n\nChoy was taken by military police, beaten, court-martialed, sentenced to eighteen months of hard labor at Fort Leaven worth. \"They beat me up every day, like a time clock.\" He ended his interview with a New York Chinatown newspaper saying: \"One thing: I want to tell all the Chinese kids that the army made me sick. They made me so sick that I can't stand it.\"\n\nA dispatch from Phu Bai in April 1972 said that fifty GIs out of 142 men in the company refused to go on patrol, crying: \"This isn't our war!\" The New York Times on July 14, 1973, reported that American prisoners of war in Vietnam, ordered by officers in the POW camp to stop cooperating with the enemy, shouted back: \"Who's the enemy?\" They formed a peace committee in the camp, and a sergeant on the committee later recalled his march from capture to the POW camp:\n\nUntil we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? After a while it just got to me.\n\nPentagon officials in Washington and navy spokesmen in San Diego announced, after the United States withdrew its troops from Vietnam in 1973, that the navy was going to purge itself of \"undesirables\"-and that these included as many as six thousand men in the Pacific fleet, \"a substantial proportion of them black.\" All together, about 700,000 GIs had received less than honorable discharges. In the year 1973, one of every five discharges was \"less than honorable,\" indicating something less than dutiful obedience to the military. By 1971, 177 of every 1,000 American soldiers were listed as \"absent without leave,\" some of them three or four times. Deserters doubled from 47,000 in 1967 to 89,000 in 1971.\n\nOne of those who stayed, fought, but then turned against the war was Ron Kovic. His father worked in a supermarket on Long Island. In 1963, at the age of seventeen, he enlisted in the marines. Two years later, in Vietnam, at the age of nineteen, his spine was shattered by shellfire. Paralyzed from the waist down, he was put in a wheelchair. Back in the States, he observed the brutal treatment of wounded veterans in the veterans' hospitals, thought more and more about the war, and joined the \"Vietnam Veterans Against the War. He went to demonstrations to speak against the war. One evening he heard actor Donald Sutherland read from the post-World War I novel by Dalton Trumbo, Johnny Got His Gun, about a soldier whose limbs and face were shot away by gunfire, a thinking torso who invented a way of communicating with the outside world and then beat out a message so powerful it could not be heard without trembling.\n\nSutherland began to read the passage and something I will never forget swept over me. It was as if someone was speaking for everything I ever went through in the hospital.... I began to shake and I remember there were tears in my eyes.\n\nKovic demonstrated against the war, and was arrested. He tells his story in Born on the Fourth of July:\n\nThey help me back into the chair and take me to another part of the prison building to be booked.\n\n\"What's your name?\" the officer behind the desk says.\n\n\"Ron Kovic,\" I say. \"Occupation, Vietnam veteran against the war.\"\n\n\"What?\" he says sarcastically, looking down at me.\n\n\"I'm a Vietnam veteran against the war,\" I almost shout back.\n\n\"You should have died over there,\" he says. He turns to his assistant. \"I'd like to take this guy and throw him off the roof.\"\n\nThey fingerprint me and take my picture and put me in a cell. I have begun to wet my pants like a little baby. The tube has slipped out during my examination by the doctor. I try to fall asleep but even though I am exhausted, the anger is alive in me like a huge hot stone in my chest. I lean my head up against the wall and listen to the toilets flush again and again.\n\nKovic and the other veterans drove to Miami to the Republican National Convention in 1972, went into the Convention Hall, wheeled themselves down the aisles, and as Nixon began his acceptance speech shouted, \"Stop the bombing! Stop the war!\" Delegates cursed them: \"Traitor!\" and Secret Service men hustled them out of the hall.\n\nIn the fall of 1973, with no victory in sight and North Vietnamese troops entrenched in various parts of the South, the United States agreed to accept a settlement that would withdraw American troops and leave the revolutionary troops where they were, until a new elected government would be set up including Communist and non-Communist elements. But the Saigon government refused to agree, and the United States decided to make one final attempt to bludgeon the North Vietnamese into submission. It sent waves of B-52s over Hanoi and Haiphong, destroying homes and hospitals, killing unknown numbers of civilians. The attack did not work. Many of the B-52s were shot down, there was angry protest all over the world-and Kissinger went back to Paris and signed very much the same peace agreement that had been agreed on before.\n\nThe United States withdrew its forces, continuing to give aid to the Saigon government, but when the North Vietnamese launched attacks in early 1975 against the major cities in South Vietnam, the government collapsed. In late April 1975, North Vietnamese troops entered Saigon. The American embassy staff fled, along with many Vietnamese who feared Communist rule, and the long war in Vietnam was over. Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City, and both parts of Vietnam were unified as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\n\nTraditional history portrays the end of wars as coming from the initiatives of leaders-negotiations in Paris or Brussels or Geneva or Versailles\u2014just as it often finds the coming of war a response to the demand of \"the people.\" The Vietnam war gave clear evidence that at least for that war (making one wonder about the others) the political leaders were the last to take steps to end the war-\"the people \" were far ahead. The President was always far behind. The Supreme Court silently turned away from cases challenging the Constitutionality of the war. Congress was years behind public opinion.\n\nIn the spring of 1971, syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak, two firm supporters of the war, wrote regretfully of a \"sudden outbreak of anti-war emotionalism\" in the House of Representatives, and said: \"The anti-war animosities now suddenly so pervasive among House Democrats are viewed by Administration backers as less anti-Nixon than as a response to constituent pressures.\"\n\nIt was only after the intervention in Cambodia ended, and only after the nationwide campus uproar over that invasion, that Congress passed a resolution declaring that American troops should not be sent into Cambodia without its approval. And it was not until late 1973, when American troops had finally been removed from Vietnam, that Congress passed a bill limiting the power of the President to make war without congressional consent; even there, in that \"War Powers Resolution,\" the President could make war for sixty days on his own without a congressional declaration.\n\nThe administration tried to persuade the American people that the war was ending because of its decision to negotiate a peace-not because it was losing the war, not because of the powerful antiwar movement in the United States. But the government's own secret memoranda all through the war testify to its sensitivity at each stage about \"public opinion\" in the United States and abroad. The data is in the Pentagon Papers.\n\nIn June of 1964, top American military and State Department officials, including Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, met in Honolulu. \"Rusk stated that public opinion on our SEA policy was badly divided and that, therefore, the President needed an affirmation of support.\" Diem had been replaced by a general named Khanh. The Pentagon historians write: \"Upon his return to Saigon on June 5 Ambassador Lodge went straight from the airport to call on General Khanh . . . the main thrust of his talk with Khanh was to hint that the United States Government would in the immediate future be preparing U.S. public opinion for actions against North Vietnam.\" Two months later came the Gulf of Tonkin affair.\n\nOn April 2, 1965, a memo from CIA director John McCone suggested that the bombing of North Vietnam be increased because it was \"not sufficiently severe\" to change North Vietnam's policy. \"On the other hand ... we can expect increasing pressure to stop the bombing .. . from various elements of the American public, from the press, the United Nations and world opinion.\" The U.S. should try for a fast knockout before this opinion could build up, McCone said.\n\nAssistant Secretary of Defense John McNaughton's memo of early 1966 suggested destruction of locks and dams to create mass starvation, because \"strikes at population targets\" would \"create a counterproductive wave of revulsion abroad and at home.\" In May 1967, the Pentagon historians write: \"McNaughton was also very deeply concerned about the breadth and intensity of public unrest and dissatisfaction with the war . .. especially with young people , the underprivileged, the intelligentsia and the women.\" McNaughton worried: \"Will the move to call up 20,000 Reserves ... polarize opinion to the extent that the 'doves' in the United States will get out of hand-massive refusals to serve, or to fight, or to cooperate, or worse?\" He warned:\n\nThere may be a limit beyond which many Americans and much of the world will not permit the United States to go. The picture of the world's greatest superpower killing or seriously injuring 1000 non-combatants a week, while trying to pound a tiny backward nation into submission, on an issue whose merits are hotly disputed, is not a pretty one, It could conceivably produce a costly distortion in the American national consciousness.\n\nThat \"costly distortion\" seems to have taken place by the spring of 1968, when, with the sudden and scary Tet offensive of the National Liberation Front, Westmorland asked President Johnson to send him 200,000 more troops on top of the 525,000 already there. Johnson asked a small group of \"action officers\" in the Pentagon to advise him on this. They studied the situation and concluded that 200,000 troops would totally Americanize the war and would not strengthen the Saigon government because: \"The Saigon leadership shows no signs of a willingness\u2014let alone an ability\u2014to attract the necessary loyalty or support of the people .\" Furthermore, the report said, sending troops would mean mobilizing reserves, increasing the military budget. There would he more U.S. casualties, more taxes. And:\n\nThis growing disaffection accompanied as it certainly will be, by increased defiance of the draft and growing unrest in the cities because of the belief that we are neglecting domestic problems, runs great risks of provoking a domestic crisis of unprecedented proportions.\n\nThe \"growing unrest in the cities\" must have been a reference to the black uprisings that had taken place in 1967\u2014and showed the link, whether blacks deliberately made it or not\u2014between the war abroad and poverty at home.\n\nThe evidence from the Pentagon Papers is clear\u2014that Johnson's decision in the spring of 1968 to turn down Westmoreland's request, to slow down for the first time the escalation of the war, to diminish the bombing, to go to the conference table, was influenced to a great extent by the actions Americans had taken in demonstrating their opposition to the war.\n\nWhen Nixon took office, he too tried to persuade the public that protest would not affect him. But he almost went berserk when one lone pacifist picketed the White House. The frenzy of Nixon's actions against dissidents-plans for burglaries, wiretapping, mail openings-suggests the importance of the antiwar movement in the minds of national leaders.\n\nOne sign that the ideas of the antiwar movement had taken hold in the American public was that juries became more reluctant to convict antiwar protesters, and local judges too were treating them differently. In Washington, by 1971, judges were dismissing charges against demonstrators in cases where two years before they almost certainly would have been sent to jail. The antiwar groups who had raided draft boards\u2014the Baltimore Four, the Catonsville Nine, the Milwaukee Fourteen, the Boston Five, and more\u2014were receiving lighter sentences for the same crimes.\n\nThe last group of draft board raiders, the \"Camden 28,\" were priests, nuns, and laypeople who raided a draft board in Camden, New Jersey, in August 1971. It was essentially what the Baltimore Four had done four years earlier, when all were convicted and Phil Berrigan got six years in prison. But in this instance, the Camden defendants were acquitted by the jury on all counts. When the verdict was in, one of the jurors, a fifty-three-year-old black taxi driver from Atlantic City named Samuel Braithwaite, who had spent eleven years in the army, left a letter for the defendants:\n\nTo you, the clerical physicians with your God-given talents, I say, well done. Well done for trying to heal the sick irresponsible men, men who were chosen by the people to govern and lead them. These men, who failed the people , by raining death and destruction on a hapless country. . .. You went out to do your part while your brothers remained in their ivory towers watching . .. and hopefully some day in the near future, peace and harmony may reign to people of all nations.\n\nThat was in May of 1973. The American troops were leaving Vietnam. C. L. Sulzberger, the New York Times correspondent (a man close to the government), wrote: \"The U.S. emerges as the big loser and history books must admit this. . . . We lost the war in the Mississippi valley, not the Mekong valley. Successive American governments were never able to muster the necessary mass support at home.\"\n\nIn fact, the United States had lost the war in both the Mekong Valley and the Mississippi Valley. It was the first clear defeat to the global American empire formed after World War II. It was administered by revolutionary peasants abroad, and by an astonishing movement of protest at home.\n\nBack on September 26, 1969, President Richard Nixon, noting the growing antiwar activity all over the country, announced that \"under no circumstance will I be affected whatever by it.\" But nine years later, in his Memoirs, he admitted that the antiwar movement caused him to drop plans for an intensification of the war: \"Although publicly I continued to ignore the raging antiwar controversy.... I knew, however, that after all the protests and the Moratorium, American public opinion would be seriously divided by any military escalation of the war.\" It was a rare presidential admission of the power of public protest.\n\nFrom a long-range viewpoint, something perhaps even more important had happened. The rebellion at home was spreading beyond the issue of war in Vietnam.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/3584603", "artist_names": "Lil Ugly Mane", "full_title": "SIDE THREE-A by\u00a0Lil\u00a0Ugly Mane", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c45836668bbbf0725c40e20d8f85f977.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c45836668bbbf0725c40e20d8f85f977.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 3584603, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 5296436, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1616036635, "path": "/Lil-ugly-mane-side-three-a-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Lil-ugly-mane-side-three-a-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 29}, "release_date_for_display": "April 29, 2015", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Apr. 29, 2015", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c45836668bbbf0725c40e20d8f85f977.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c45836668bbbf0725c40e20d8f85f977.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false}, "title": "SIDE THREE-A", "title_with_featured": "SIDE THREE-A", "updated_by_human_at": 1624414249, "url": "https://genius.com/Lil-ugly-mane-side-three-a-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/17011", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/6f0db7dccd35f8c65efea9458b1dd6ca.288x284x1.png", "id": 17011, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c872f7176761541be4635ae4dac3b3c2.480x480x1.jpg", "index_character": "l", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Lil Ugly Mane", "slug": "Lil-ugly-mane", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Lil-ugly-mane"}, "artist": "Lil Ugly Mane", "lyrics": "SIDE THREE-A LyricsPart I\n[Instrumental]\n\n\nPart II\n[Intro]\nYo, Dylan do a lot of shit\nSo funky, uh huh\nAyy, you feel that?

Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.'\nThe prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a\nstiletto and in the empty black void we:\n\nCUT TO\n\nOpening Montage - Documentary Footage:\n2 THE DISEMBARKATION\nfrom the harbor in Mariel, Cuba. Vessels of every nature,\nwaving masses, demonstrations....\n\n3 THE CROSSING\nSun and storm.\n\n4 THE LANDING - KEY WEST\nThe flag of the United States. Choppers swooping over the ragged coastline of the Keys. Emerald waters dotted with fishing trawlers and pleasure craft, an \"America the Beautiful\"-type Immigration theme surging over this.\n\n5 THE PROCESSING\nLong lines. Immigration and Nationalization Officials, customs, Public Health, FBI, Church and Relief Organizations.\nBabies bawling, arguments over paperwork, refugees being\ninterviewed by TV news, people crying, people eating,\nfamilies huddled on floors... chaos.\nThe music theme continuing in stately calm as we:\n\nCUT TO\n6 INT. OFFICE - PROCESSING HALL - AFTERNOON -\nA FULL and CLOSEUP OF\n7 TONY MONTANA 7\nthe scar-faced one, in the young angry prime of his life.\nWe dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and\nthen. We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally we\nencompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --\nmuscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and\non the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.\nHe is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken\ncardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from\nprison.\n\nOver this:\n\nVOICE #1 (o.s.)\nOkay so what do you call yourself?\n\nVOICE #2 (o.s.)\nComo se llama?\n\nMONTANA\nTony Montana...you?\n\nVOICE #1\nWhere'd you learn to speak the English, Tony?\n\nMONTANA\nMy old man -- he was American. Sailor. Bum.\nI always know, y'know, one day I gonna come to America.\nI see all the movies...\nVOICE #1\nSo where's your old man now?\n\nMONTANA\nHe's dead. He died. Somewhere...\n\nVOICE #1\nMother?\n\nTONY\nShe's dead too.\n\nVOICE #2\nWhat kind of work you do in Cuba, Tony?\n\nTONY\nThis. That. The Army. Some construction work....\n\nVOICE #2\nUnhunh. Got any family in the States, Tony? Cousins, brother-in-law?\n\nTONY\n(a beat)\nNobody. Everybody's dead.\n\nMAN #I\nY'ever been in jail, Tony?\n\nTONY\nMe jail? No way.\n\nWe now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three.\n\nMAN #l\n(checking off a list)\nYou been in a mental hospital, Tony?\n\nTONY\n(grinning)\nYeah, in the boat coming over.\n\nMAN #1\nHow 'bout homosexuality, Tony? You like men, y'like to dress up like a woman?\n\nTONY\n(to Man #2)\nNever tried it. What the fuck's wrong with this guy, what's he think I am?\n\nMAN #2\nJust answer the questions, Tony.\n\nThe voices of the men remain cool and collected throughout.\n\nTONY\n(to Man #1)\nFuck no.\n\nMAN #1\nArrested? Vagrancy? Marijuana?\n\nTONY\nNO. ...NO. Never. Nothing.\n\nHis eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors)\nand he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with the\ntips of the fingers. Man #3 is stepping forward out of the\nshadows.\n\nMAN #3\nSo where'd you get the beauty scar?\n\nTONY\nThis?..\n(scratching the scar, shrugs)\nI was a kid. You should see the other kid.\n(a grim chuckle)\n\nMAN #3\nAnd this?\n\nHe holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between the\nthumb and second finger -- a heart with the word \"Madre\"\nscaled through it.\n\nTONY\nOh that was for my sweetheart.\n\nMAN #3\nSweetheart?\n(to the other men)\nWe been seeing more and more of these. It's some kinda code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin\nor something. This one's new... You want to tell us, Montana or you want to take a little trip to the detention center?\n\nTONY\nHey, so I was in the can once for buying dollars. Big deal.\n\nMAN #3\nThat's pretty funny, Tony.\n\nTONY\nSome Canadian tourist....\n\nMAN #3\nWhat'd you mug him first? Get him outta here!\n(starts to walk out)\n\nTONY\nHey, so I fuck Castro, what's it to you? You a Communist or something?\nHow would you like it they tell you all the time what to think, what to do, you wanna be like a sheep, like everybody else. Baa baa? Puta! You want a stoolie on every block? You wanna work eight hours a day and you never own nothing? I ate octopus three times a day, fucking octopus is coming out my ears, fuckin' Russian shoes are eating through my feet. Whaddaya want? You want me to stay there? Hey, I'm no little whore, I'm no stinking thief! I'm Tony Montana and I'm a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking 'Human Rights' just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?\n\nSilence.\nThere's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but\nit falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.\n\nMAN #l\nCarter should see this human right. He's good. He's very good. What do you say Harry?\n\nMAN #3\n(walking out)\nI... 'Freedomtown.' Let them take a look at him. A long look.\n\nTONY\nHey, that's okay, too, Harry. No hard feelings.\n\nMan #3 at the door stops, looks back.\n\nTONY\nSend me here, send me there. This.\nThat. Nothing you can do to me\nHarry, Castro didn't do -- nothing....\n\nThat taunting smile on Tony's lips as, to the music of the\nimmigration theme, we:\n\nDISSOLVE TO\n7-A INT. FEDERAL BUS - HOUR LATER 7-A\nThe bus is packed with the harder-looking refugee-types.\nThe windows are caged and we see INS guards.\nThe noise level is high, like a sack of monkeys.\n\nManny (Manolo) Ribera's got his feet up on an empty seat.\nHe's big, strong, handsome, with dashing darkly feminine\neyes -- younger than Tony, and dapper in his cheap clothing.\nHe's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.\n\nMANNY\nSeat's taken.\n\nTONY\nSo I'll sit in your lap.\n\nTony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out\nof Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then\nreturns the empty wrapper to Manny,\n\nTONY\nSo what'd you tell them?\n\nMANNY\nI told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.\n\nTONY\nI didn't tell you sanitation. I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.\n\nThe bus pulling out now.\n\nMANNY\nIs that what you told me? You didn't tell me that.\n\nTONY\nYou know if you hadn't opened your mouth, they woulda thought you were a horse. I told you to tell them you had TB and was cured.\n\nMANNY\nFuck you Tony....\n\nTONY\nYou did nothing right. I shoulda left you in Cuba.\n\n7-B EXT. MIAMI FROM BUS - ESTABLISHING SHOT 7-B\nof Miami as, to the music of the Immigration theme, we:\n\nDISSOLVE TO\n8 INT. TONY'S TENT - FREEDOMTOWN - NIGHT (SIX MONTHS LATER) 8\n\nA movie projector...\n...the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid. We're watching a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra-Madre. It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking to himself just before the bandits get him....\n\nThe rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,\nthe camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,\neyes in cat-like repose... to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an eleven year old, mouth hanging open.\n\nBOGART\nWhat a thing.\nConscience. Conscience.\nIf you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you? Makes me sick so much talking and fussing about nonsense.\nTime to go to sleep.\n(closes his eyes\nbut not for long)\n\nCUT TO\n\n9 INT. TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT 9\nTony is moving down 23rd Street, the walk proud and jungle\nin the rock of the hips and the cast of the shoulders --\nnow accompanied by his handsome compadre, Manny.\n\nTONY\nThat Bogart, Chico, hunh?\n\nMANNY\nFucking crazy, hunh!\n\nTONY\nThat gold dust blowing in the wind.\nY'see Manny, he's always looking over his shoulder. Hunh? Like me....\n\nHe hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,\nimitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with\nzig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,\nTony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a\npop button pinned to his shirt that says \"Fuck Off and Die.\"\nAnd his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence\nmore pronounced.\n\nTONY\n. . . don't trust nobody.\n\nMANNY\nYeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.\n\nTONY\nNever happen to me, Chico. That's one thing I never gonna be. I never gonna be crazy like that.\n\nMANNY\nYeah, how do you know....\n\nTONY\nI know.\n\nMANNY\nI don't know. Sometimes you crazy, too, Tony.\n\nTONY\nAssholes, I go crazy. You Manny, I never go crazy with you. You're\nlike my brother, I love you!\n\nMANNY\nYeah, sure.\n\nTONY\nHey, c'mon.\n\nTony playfully punches Manny and they walk on into the humid night, intersecting a young punk, Chi-Chi.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(to Manny; Spanish)\nHey Manny.\n\nMANNY\nOye Chi-Chi, what's going down.\n\nCHI-CHI\nUsual shit. Want some peanuts? Pago's carrying tonight.\n\nMANNY\nI don't know, I get all fucked up on it....\n\nCHI-CHI\nWant some new snatch? A pussycat\nname of Yolanda just rolled onto the\nBoulevard ---\n\nMANNY\nOh yeah, what she look like?\n\nCHI-CHI\nShe look like you 'cept she got a snatch.\n\nMANNY\nA real snatch?\n\nCHI-CHI\nYou're not kidding. It talks.\n\nAs they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the head\nfor Manny. \"Later.\"\n\nHe's in the middle of the \"Boulevard\" where a bustling black\nmarket in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transvestites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack neon.\n\nHe ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,\npast a \"Viva Carter!\" proclamation in graffiti....\n\nTRANSVESTITE\n(passing)\nWhat about you sugar -- you wanna party?\n\nTONY\n(passing her)\nYeah with whose cock, honey?\n\nCUT TO\n\n10 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN GROUNDS - NIGHT 10\nTony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in, trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.\n\nTony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone\nnumber written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As he\nfinishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see\na young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,\nstanding together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in\nshadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with\nhandling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone\nrings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have\nnot yet seen in Tony.\n\nSomeone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His\nexpression alters to uncertainty.\n\nVOICE\nYes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?\n\nTony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those\nin line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony\nignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his\npants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.\n\nHe walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes\nsomebody in another phone booth and goes over.\n\nAngel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on\nthe phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a\nworn phone book in his hand.\n\nTONY\nAngel, how ya doin'?\n\nANGEL\nYou know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City? And I gotta call every fucking one of 'em to find my brother!\n\nTONY\n(in passing)\nDon't waste your dime, Chico. You know your brother hates you.\n\nANGEL\nGo fuck yourself, Tony.\n\nManny catches up to Tony.\n\nTONY\nWhatcha hanging around with that hustler for?\n\nMANNY\nHey Chi-Chi's okay, he hears things,\n\nTONY\nWhat's he hear I don't hear.\n\nAngel comes over, listens.\n\nMANNY\nHe hears we got problems. Immigration is having these hearings, y ' know? And they're saying nine out of ten of us is gonna get shipped back!\n\nTONY\nOh yeah?\n\nMANNY\nYeah.

Riots, fires, broken heads... things are gonna pop here.\n\nTONY\nShit, I coulda told you that.\n\nMANNY\nYeah, so what do you think the immigration's gonna do when we riot? You think they're gonna let us out? They're gonna throw away the key, that's what.\n\nANGEL\nOh shit!\n\nMANNY\nWhat's I say. This is gonna end bad, muchachos....\n\nTONY\nHey, I tell you guys this isn't Cuba here, this is the United States. They got nothing but lawyers here. We're on the television. We're in the newspapers. Whatta they gonna do -- ship us back to Cuba? Castro-- he don't want us. Nobody no place wants us so whatta they gonna do -- put us in a gas chamber so all the people can see? They're stuck with us, Chico -- they gotta let us go!\n\nMANNY\nYeah, well, what if we gotta sit here another six months, hunh?\n\nTONY\nYou worry too much, mi hermano. Like the man says, 'when you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow' --hunh?\n\nTony winks and walks off.\n\nThe radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack. Tony loves the sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny and Angel.\n\nTONY\n(in awful imitation)\n'Oh yeah America! Love-to love you baby, oh yeah!'\n\nCUT TO\n\n11 EXT. PLAYING FIELD - DAY - TWO WEEKS LATER\n\n\nCamera on Tony shuffling and feinting a soccer ball in an impromptu game; he's covered with sweat, tires a fancy move\naround a younger kid who not only steals the ball away off him but manages to lay him flat on his face.\n\nTONY\n(lying there)\nAw fuck....\n\nThe game, leaving him behind, shifts downfield.\n\nMANNY\nAye !

C'mon!\n\nManny, just arrived at the edge of the field, waves him off.\nTony, getting up, brushing himself off, walks off the field\ntowards him.\n\nANGEL\n(at a distance)\nHey Tony where ya going?\n\nTONY\nI got better things to do.\n\nANGEL\nChicken liver, hunh?\n\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nYeah?\n\n(looking zd)\nLet's walk.\n\nThey walk.\n\nMANNY\nYou ready for the good news, cone?\n\nTONY\nYeah.\n\nMANNY\nWe can be outta here in thirty days.\nNot only that.

Injured refugees lie bleeding on the grounds.\n\n24 AN ENTIRE BARRACK\nnow goes up in flames.\n\n25 INSIDE THE BARRACK\nA bewildered Emilio Rebenga grabs his papers and valuables.\n\nManny runs up on him.\n\nRebenga sees him, senses danger, flees down the aisle with his satchel, intersecting other panicked refugees.\n\nManny follows.\nRebenga stumbles into a bed frame, shatters his glasses,\nthen runs on. Into the smoke and flame. Out of which Scarface now appears -- in his killing wrath.\n\nTONY\nRebenga!\n\nRebenga snaps to the sound of the voice.\n\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nFrom the friends you fucked!\n\nThe work is fast. The stiletto punches nine quick holes in his lungs and his heart...  And the figure of death is gone.\n\n...And Emilio Rebenga staggers wildly in the smoke, uncomprehending eyes encased in broken glasses. Sinking out of frame.\n\n26 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN - DAY\nThe riot is over. The grounds are still, smoke and debris the aftermath.\n\nDISSOLVE TO\n\n27 INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY - A MONTH LATER\n\nAn Immigration Officer passes a sheaf of documents across a desk into a pair of hands. The camera gliding along a Green Card pinned to the top of the stack.\n\nIt says \"ANTHONY MONTANA\" and it has picture and stamps. It's official, as the camera moves with triumphant immigration theme music to the face of Mr. Montana examining quite contentedly the rewards of his efforts.\n\nEnd of montage. Music continues.\n\nDISSOLVE TO\n\n27-A EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY\nThe new Miami is rising ubiquitously above Biscayne Bay,\nthe camera moving past blossoming skyscrapers, workmen,\nhuge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a\nbeautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white\nclouds... past a giant billboard:\n\nHOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?\nCOME TALK TO US...\nAT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...\nTODAY!\n\nPast banks of glass (Caribank, Banco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...\n\nInsert a car sticker going by with the image of the American flag and the reminder: \"Will the last American leaving Miami please bring flag?\"\n\nTony and Manny bop along the street in their hand-me-down\nclothes, oogling the chicas and the bodegas (in a plush\nmodern area of Miami). Boats. Buildings. Cars.\n\nTONY\n(looking around)\nBoy -- can you believe this place, Chico?\n\nMANNY\n(Spanish)\nMan, they weren't kidding around.\n\nTONY\n(pointing to a little old man walking towards them)\nSee that old guy over there?\n\nMANNY\nYeah.\n\nTONY\nMillionaire.\n\nMANNY\nHow do you know?\n\nTONY\nGo over there.

You wanna score one of these chicks, watch me. Mira!\n\nHe wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small\nwhirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in\nthe flick of an eye.\n\nTONY\n...the fuck was that?\n\nMANNY\nYou didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.\n\nDoes it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head\npeeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.\n\nTONY\nWhat the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin'.\n\nMANNY\nYou think so hunh? Well you don't know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.\n\nDoes it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility, provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a shop window.\n\nMANNY\n(doing it again)\nTakes practice, mi sangre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it....\n\nTONY\nOooh... cono! How 'bout that one?\n\nPointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.\n\nMANNY\nNo problem.\n\n27-B EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY\nTony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arm\nand stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't\ngive a shit.\n\nTONY\nCome on?\n\nManny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a\ncar screeching to a halt in front of him.\n\nTONY\n(points)\nOkay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.\n\nThe blonde has paused to look in a shop window.\n\nManny stops alongside, pretends to look. When he catches\nher eyes, he flicks his tongue.\n\nShe looks at him, confused, then back into the window.\nManny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.\n\nTony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber\nchild, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his\nown version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at\nhim puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now\nsmiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles\nand moves along.\n\nMeanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face\nand walks away.\n\nTony walks over to him, mocking.\n\nTONY\nPobre hijo de puta -- you got it all mixed up.\nThis country first you gotta get the money, then you get\nthe power and when you got the power, then you get the women -- and then, Chico, you got the world by the balls. Por los conjones.\n\nMANNY\nThere you go talking big again man. You don't know shit about the world.

It combines the social functions of a family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night watering hole for various beasts of prey.\n\nThe waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths\nto the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The\ncamera following past the pots and the pans and the steam\nand the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of\nthis dungeon....\n\n. . . To reveal Tony Montana stubbing grease off the pots and\nManny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and\nexhausted. A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes\nto the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.\n\nTONY\nYour big shot friend better come up with something soon. I didn't come to America to break my fucking back, querido.\n\nMANNY\n(equally irritated)\nHey he's coming okay! What do you want?\n\nCUT TO\n\n29 INT./EXT.

PARKING LOT OUTSIDE LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nOmar Suarez (El Mono -- \"The Monkey\") is so named cause he\nlooks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish\nintelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing\nbetween words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor... with him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.\n\nMANNY\n(leaning in the window)\nHey Omar, Waldo, coma esta... my friend I told you about. Tony Montana... Omar Suarez, Waldo Rojas....\n\nWaldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move back to Manny.\n\nOMAR\nI got something for you.\n\nMANNY\nOh yeah! That's great...

You're talkin' to important guys here.\n\nMANNY\n(shocked)\nHey Tony, c'mon, it's okay Omar, we...\n\nTONY\nShaddup!\n\nOmar sniggers, his eyes shifting to Waldo who shakes his\nhead and laughs.\n\nOMAR\n(to Manny only)\nSo what's it with this dishwasher, Chico? Don't he think we coulda gotten some other space cadet to do Rebenga -- cheaper maybe. Fifty bucks?\n\nTONY\n(shrugs)\nSo why didn't you?

The porches are filled with senior citizens\nplaying cards, reading papers, staring, slowly walking the\nstreet.\n\nThe ramshackle sedan, jammed with Tony and his gang,\nrattles past. It's a beaten-up black and blue Monte Carlo,\njacked up on its springs with dune buggy threads and\nneeding paint. You'd arrest these guys on sight.\n\n32 INT./EXT. TONY'S CADILLAC - MIAMI BEACH - DAY\nseen from the inside of the sedan. Tony turns down the salsa beat on the radio, smoking a cigarette tensely. Manny is driving. In the dilapidated backseat are Angel, the baby-faced punk, and Chi-Chi, both from Freedomtown.\n\nManny, reflecting the tension, whistles a rapid series of notes under his breath as he waits for a light to change.\n\nMANNY\nHey look at that chick, hunh? Lookit those tits man, she's begging for it!\n\nAt the curb, an old crone hunchbacks her way in front of the teenage chick, who is coming off the beach in a bikini, blocking her off.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(looking over)\nWhatta you crazy? She's 103 years old.\n\nMANNY\nNot her stupido! Her....\n\nCamera revealing the teenager.\n\nTONY\n(the light changing)\nDrive, willya.\n\nMANNY\n(mocking)\nSure, sure. Not to worry, Tony -- You get a heart attack.\n(looking in the rearview mirror)\nAngel, whatcha wearing the face for?\n\nANGEL\n(tense, making light of it)\nAh, it's okay. I just y'know forgot to make an offering. I was supposed to go by the madrina today.\n\nMANNY\nYou still going to that cuncha?\n\nANGEL\nShe knows her shit. She talks to Yemaya and Chango like nobody y'ever heard.\n\nAs he talks Angel fingers a Negrita charm hanging around\nhis neck -- Chango, God of Fire and Thunder, his black face\ntilted at a carnal angle. Sharp teeth glinting, his eyes\nrolling in orgasmic imagery, his head crowned with gold.\nMany of the Marielitos in the film will be wearing this,\nalso pendants with an eye to ward off the evil spirits, red\nand white beads, red kerchiefs, black hand charms silver-\nbangled bracelets, etc., all relating to their Afro-Catholic\nspiritualism.\n\nMANNY\n(making fun)\nYeah, Chango looking out for us,\n\nCHI-CHI\nAngel?\n\nANGEL\nChango looking out for all the 'bandidos' everywhere. But you gotta pay him his dues, y'know. You gotta let him know you respect him. You don't, Chango -- he gets pissed an'...\n\nTONY\n(angry)\nHey, shaddup -- all of ya! I told you before I don't go for that mystical voodoo shit. That's for the old cunchas waving their rooster cocks in some dark alley, There's no gods, there's no Chango -- nowhere! You make your own luck. So shaddup and act like you're in the United States here.\n\nSilence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- THE SUN RAY -- is coming closer.\n\nTONY\nOkay, this is it. Pull over across the street.\nThe motel is coming closer in silence.\n\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nMoney stays in the trunk till I come out and get it. Me. Nobody else. If I'm not out in fifteen minutes, something's wrong. I'm in Room 9. You ready, Angelito?\n\nANGEL\nSure thing.\n\nAs Manny pulls the car up, they pull out Ingram Model-10\nmachine pistol with folding butt and suppressor, ten inches\nof kill power capable of firing 1100 rounds a minute -- it\ncan be slipped into a man's purse, it's in vogue. Tony getting out, to Angel:\n\nTONY\nLet's go....\n\nCUT TO\n\n33 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nTony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior\ncorridor to a room marked \"9\". Nodding to Angel who remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol, Tony knocks.\nPause.\n\n34 EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThe door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-inch Colombian, \"The Toad\". He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.\n\nTOAD\nHey, oye amigo....\n\nSpreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.\n\n35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nTony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and\nblue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.\n\nTONY\n(as he steps in)\nHow you doing amigo...?\n\nThe other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark\nColombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, \"The Lizard\"; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.\n\nThe Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.\n\nTONY\n(checking out the room)\nMind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?\n\nToad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,\nthe conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.\n\nTOAD\nSure, no problem... This is Marta.\n\nTONY\nHello, Marta.\nShe nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the\ntelevision set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists\nintermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.\n\nTOAD\nI'm Hector...\n\nPause.\n\nTONY\nYeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.\n\nTOAD\nYeah, Omar's okay.\n\nTONY\nYou know Omar.\n\nTOAD\nOmar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.\n\nTONY\nOkay...\n\nTOAD\nOkay... so you got the money?\n\nTONY\nYeah, you got the stuff?\n\nTOAD\nSure I got the stuff, but I don't\ngot it right here with me.

The Lizard staring at him...\n\nTOAD\nNot far.\n\nPause. Everything seems okay.\n\nTONY\nSo what do we do, walk in and start over?\n\nTOAD\n(changes subject)\nWhere you from?\n\nTony's eyes check out the bathroom.\n\nTONY\nWhat fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from?\n\nTOAD\nI like to get to know who I do business with.\n\nIt's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a\nmove somewhere off-center and is now sitting on the bed,\ncoiled and always watching.\n\nTONY\nYou get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector.\n\nTOAD\nHey I'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't...\n\nTONY\nOkay, what's the stall here? Your guy late or something?\n\n36 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThere's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then\ncommotion.\n\nANGEL\nTony!\n\nTony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening\nfemale shriek, like a bird.\n\nLIZARD\n(slang Spanish)\nDon't! Get up! Now shithead!\n\nShe's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to shoot.\n\nThe Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back, approaches Tony. Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more\nColumbians, \"The Kids\".\n\nThey slam the door, both carrying Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little piranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard in fast Columbese slang.\n\nAs Toad strips the handgun from Tony:\n\nTONY\nFrog face, you just fucked up. You steal from me, you're dead.\n\nToad shrugs, he couldn't care less.\n\nTOAD\nYeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first? 'Fore I kill you?\n\nTONY\nTry sticking your head up your ass.\nSee if it fits.\n\nToad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto\ntaped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something\nin hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel\ninto the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.\nEven more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now\npulls out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begins\nassembling it as Lizard, still covering Tony with her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, ironically not in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n37 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\n\nChi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across\nthe street. Manny paces outside the car, glances.\n\n38 EXT.

Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.\n\nTony, covered by the two kids, watches from the lip of the\nbathroom. He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their\npistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.\nAngel looks at Tony; the eyes between them steady. They're\ndead and they know it.\n\nToad, well-prepared, connects a voltage adapter and extension cord.\n\nTOAD\n(to Tony)\nYou watch what happens to your friend okay? If you don't want this to happen to you, you get the money.\n\nLizard reenters the room, shakes her head at the Toad who\nnods and turns on the whirring machine.\n\nThe Toad smiles amiably and angles the chainsaw slowly\ntowards Angel.\n\nThe two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at his\nbrains... Off-camera, we know what's happening as we hear the chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.\n\nLizard has no expression on her face. The machine cuts off.\n\nThe Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his shirt, examining his first cut like a butcher. He glances at Tony.\n\nTOAD\nNow the leg, hunh?\n\nA brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.\n\nCUT TO\n\n41 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nManny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with\nChi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel. They\nsignal and separate.\n\nCUT TO\n\n42 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThe Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.\n\nTony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes.\n\nTOAD\nOkay, my 'caracortada', you can die too. Makes no difference to me.\n\nHe nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel\nlying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of\nhis blood, piss dead.\n\nCUT TO\n\n43 EXT.

In the background, the window simultaneously blows out as Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.\n\nIn sharp foreground, the Lizard crumples forward on her knees, foaming blood.\n\nTony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram.\n\nIn the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical, gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.\n\nChi-Chi, climbing through the window, fires at him.\n\nMeanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces\na knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine pistol.\n\nHe blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.\n\nTony, yelling, whirls after the Toad.\n\nTONY\nI got him!\n\nManny, holding his side, empties his pistol on kid one, who is still twitching.\n\nChi-Chi sees Angel, gags.\n\nCUT TO\n46 EXT.

He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.\n\nLOPEZ\nHow ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet you. How 'bout a drink?\n\nTONY\nMr. Lopez... real pleasure.\n\nLOPEZ\nCall me Frank, Tony. Everybody calls me Frank.

That's the two keys. Angel died 'cause of this shit. And here's the money.\n(produces the money)\nIt's my gift to you -- from me.\n\nPause.

When she's not looking. What do you say guys, to a little food?\n(finishes his drink at his impatient pace)\n\nTONY\nYeah sure, I could eat a horse.\n\nERNIE\nHere she comes, Mr. Lopez.\n\nTONY looks up, his eyes tumbling on the most beautiful blonde he's ever seen. The lady, is coming down the glassed-in elevator, adjusting her $10,000 Yves St. Laurent burgundy dinner dress.\n\nLOPEZ\nOooh sweetheart, you look like a million bucks.\n\nShe doesn't answer, her eyes flicking disinterestedly over to Tony and Manny, knowing what the evening's going to be and not too happy about it.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE**\nLOPEZ\nWhere you been baby, it's ten o'clock, I'm hungry.\n\nELVIRA\nYou're always hungry, you should try starving.\n\nLopez laughs.\n\nLOPEZ\nI want you to meet a friend of mine.\nTony Montana... Elvira... Manny Ribera.\n\nELVIRA\nHello.\n\nTONY\nUh... hi.\n\nMANNY\n(equally impressed)\nYeah, hi.\n\nELVIRA\nI assume we're going to be a fivesome.\nWhere are we having dinner?\n\nFRANK\nOh, I thought we'd eat at the Babylon.\n\nELVIRA\nAgain? If anyone wanted to assassinate\nyou, you wouldn't be too hard to find.\n\nLOPEZ\n(coming toward her, laughing)\nMe? Who'd want to kill me? I got nothing but friends.\n\nELVIRA\nYou never know, do you? Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.\n\nNeatly avoiding his intended smooch, she slips by him towards the door, her throat flashing a $20,000 strip of jewelry.\n\nELVIRA\nCome on, Frank, let's go.\n\nTracking a cool, polished hauteur, she exits the apartment.\n\nLopez, after a pause, snaps at his men.\n\nLOPEZ\nOkay, let's go.\n\nCUT TO\n54 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nWe know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them\nout of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Corniches in a long snaking line down the driveway. Single girls in high-collared silver lame jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening tents back and forth across the entry doors, rich young coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in appreciation. Brain drain.\n\n55 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nThe interior is built like three or four plush apartments that run together on three separate levels with imaginative angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band, hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games, computers and a restaurant. It's a lavish fun spot that will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven and nighttime capital of South America.\n\nThe crowd, a combination of Caucasian and Latin, is mostly\nyoung, rich and happy and a lot of them coked; the girls, upperclass in sleek dresses, trim figures, heels, hats, sensuous bodies, yell as they dance to a black American music beat, \"Celebrating\" or \"Partying Down Tonight\".\n\nThe waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel\nhats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose\nand high heels.\n\nRich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their\nnecks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.\n\nDown at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and\ntough-looking tank tops with \"Motherfuckah\" and \"Fuck Me\"\nwritten on them. Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to pick one of them up.\n\nMANNY\nSo whaddaya say, hunh?\n\nHe flashes his tongue. She looks at him, amused.\n\nCHICK\nYou got a buck?\n\nMANNY\nSure I got a buck, whaddaya think I am, poor?\n\nCHICK\n(indicates the machine)\nPut it in, let's play.\n\nMANNY\nI had other things in mind.\n\nCHICK\nYou check out on this and we'll talk about other things.\n\nMANNY\n(looks off, concerned, then confronts the complex machine)\nFuck, how do you play this thing?\n\nCUT TO\n56 INT. BABYLON CLUB 56\nFrank Lopez, intoxicated, takes his heart pill with a slug\nof champagne. He sits next to Tony, who is agog at all this wealth. Omar and Ernie look on. Elvira is in conversation with a girl friend who has stopped by. They're sitting at the best table in the place, finishing up a giant meal. The empty spot belongs to Manny.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Tony)\nOver there that's Ronnie Echeverria.\nHim and his brother Miguel, they got a big distribution set-up here to Houston and Tucson....\n\nTheir point of view -- Ronnie Echevarria, powerful, competent looking man in conversation with a party of people.\n\nLOPEZ\nThat guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar Gomez. Bad news. Stone killer there ever was one. Stay away.\n\nTheir point of view -- Gaspar Gomez at a table with another\nguy and gorgeous woman.\n\nLOPEZ\n...the fat guy, with the chicas is Nacho Contreras -- El Gordo. Wouldn't know it to look at him but he's got more cash than anybody in here. A real haza....\n\nTheir point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas.\n\nLOPEZ\n. ..you know what a haza is, Tony?\n\nTONY\n'Haza'? No Frank, what's a haza?\n\nLOPEZ\nIt's Yiddish for pig. It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know. That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for. If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it! Lesson number one -- don't underestimate the other guy's greed.\n\nELVIRA\nLesson number two -- don't get high on your own supply.\n\nThe girl friend has departed and Elvira turns her attention back to them, bored.\n\nLOPEZ\nThat's right. Course not everybody follows the rules.\n(eyeing Elvira)\n\nHEAD WAITER\nThere you go, Mr. Lopez.\n\nHe's popped the champagne cork and pours Dom Perignon for Lopez.\n\nLOPEZ\nGive it to everybody and bring another, willya Jack?\n\nHead Waiter nods.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Tony)\nFive hundred fifty dollars for this bottle Tony, what do you think of that, hunh? For a bunch of fucking grapes -- isn't that something?\n\nELVIRA\n(to Tony)\nIn France, it cost $100 but don't tell anybody in Miami.\n\nTony catches her eye. She looks away, interested.\n\n57 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nA Man passes the table. Lopez calls out.\n\nLOPEZ\nHey, George -- buddy.\n\nMAN\nHey, Frank.. -how's the case coming?\n\nThe Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.\n\nLOPEZ\nOy, I shoulda come to you 'stead of that putz, Neufeld.\n\nSHEFFIELD\nJack's a good lawyer. I taught him everything he knows.\n\nLOPEZ\nYeah, almost everything.\n\nSHEFFIELD\n(to Elvira)\nElvira, you look terrific...\n(to all)\nEnjoy yourselves.\n\nHe ambles off.\n\nLOPEZ\n. . . best goddamn lawyer in Miami. Cost a brick to pick up a phone.\n\nTony looking off at him, remembering it.\n\nLOPEZ\n(raising his champagne glass)\nSo... here's to old friends...and new friends.\n\nThey toast, Tony tasting it like it was Holy Water.\n\nLOPEZ\nWell, Tony?\n\nTONY\nHey, yeah, you're not kidding, this is good stuff, Frank.\n\nLopez laughs, likes the kid, tweaks him on the cheek.\n\nLOPEZ\n(checking Tony's threads)\nYeah, get you some new clothes, some $500 suits, you'll look real sharp. I'd like you and your boys to handle some stuff for me, Tony, work with Omar here. We're doing something big next month. Running a string of mules out of Columbia. You do good on that, there'll be other things.\n\nOmar doesn't like it but glances away.\n\nTONY\nHey, that sounds like fun, Frank. Thanks.\n\nThe music shifts to slow dancing.\n\nELVIRA\n(waving away cigar smoke)\nSo, you want to dance, Frank or you want to sit here and have a heart attack?\n\nLOPEZ\nDance? I'd rather have a heart attack.\n\nELVIRA\n(rising)\nDon't foam into the Dom Perignon.\n\nGlancing at Omar, sitting there obediently. Her eyes say forget it.\n\nELVIRA\n(to Tony)\nHow about you?\n\nTony nods sure, looks at his boss.\n\nLOPEZ\n(waves)\nGo on!\n\nThey go.\n\n58 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nIt's interesting to watch Tony walk to the floor, leading Elvira. It's not so much an act of walking as it is an act of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody off that gets in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight dead line, eyes forward. It's not that he doesn't see the people he bumps off, it's that he couldn't care less.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Omar)\nWhat do you think?\n\nOMAR\nI think he's a fucking peasant.\n\nLOPEZ\nYeah -- but you get guys like that on your side, they break their backs for you.\n\nCUT TO\n59 INT. BABYLON CLUB DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 59\nTony and Elvira are dancing semiclose to a slow Billy Joel\ndance tune. He's no great shakes as a dancer, leaden in\nthe legs and shoulders.\n\nTONY\n...so what's your name, Elvira what?\n\nELVIRA\nSt. James.\n\nTONY\nElvira St. James. Sounds like a nun or something. So where you from?\n\nHe bumps into an elderly couple dancing, ignores them.\n\nELVIRA\nBaltimore...\n\nTONY\nBaltimore? Where's that?\n\nELVIRA\nLook, it doesn't really matter. I'm getting a headache.\n\nTONY\nJust trying to be friendly.\n\nELVIRA\nI've got enough friends -- and I don't need another one, 'specially one who just got off the banana boat.\n\nHe makes a point of looking at her.\n\nTONY\nHey, I didn't come over on no banana boat. I'm a political refugee here.\n\nELVIRA\nOh, part of the Cuban crime wave?\n\nTony, pissed, bangs once more into the elderly couple.\nThe man stops dancing, looks at him exasperated but Tony\ndoesn't see.\n\nTONY\nWhatta you talking crazy for, whatsa matter with you?\n\nELVIRA\n(interrupting)\nI'm sorry. I didn't know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.\n\nTONY\nWhy you got this beef against the world? You got a nice face, you got great legs, you got the fancy clothes and you got this look in your eyes like you haven't been fucked good in a year. What's the problem, baby?\n\nElvira laughs at him, furious.\n\nELVIRA\nYou know you're even stupider than you look. Let me give you a crash course, Jose whatever your name is, so you know what you're doing around here.\n\nTONY\n(interrupting)\nNow you're talking to me, baby!\n\nELVIRA\nFirst who, where, why and how I fuck is none of your business, second don't call me 'baby,' I'm not your baby and last, even if I was blind, desperate, starved and begging for it on a desert island, you'd be the last thing I'd ever fuck. You got the picture now -- so fuck off.\n\nTONY\nHey, thataway.\n\nShe whips off the floor, pissed. He watches her, amused.\n\nCUT TO\n\n63 CAR - DAWN\nTony and Manny drive home in the broken down Monte Carlo sedan through the streets of Little Havana.\n\nThey've been partying all night, clothes rumpled, Tony smoking his cigar, feeling good.\n\nTONY\nThat chick he's with... she loves me.\n\nMANNY\n(driving)\nOh yeah, how you know that?\n\nTONY\nThe eyes, Manny -- they don't lie.\n\nMANNY\nYou're serious? Tony, that's Lopez's lady. He'll kill us.\n\nTONY\nWhat are you kidding -- he's soft.\nI seen it in his face -- booze and a cuncha tells him what to do.\n\nPause.\n\n63-A OMITTED\n\n64 EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER\nThe new Miami is rising ubiquitously-above Biscayne Bay,\nthe camera moving past blossoming Skyscrapers, workmen,\nhuge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white clouds... past a giant billboard:\n\nHOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?\nCOME TALK TO US...\nAT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...\nTODAY!\n\nPast banks of glass (Caribank, Ranco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...\n\nInsert a car sticker going by with the image of the\nAmerican flag and the reminder: \"Will the last American\nleaving Miami please bring the flag?\"\n\nTony and Manny, on a shopping spree, bop along an incredibly luxurious shopping mall lined with the latest stores, fashions, escalators, music, tropical plants, etc -- a warm womb-like plastic heaven.\n\nTONY\nI shoulda been here 10 years age man.

You wanna score one of these chicks, watch. Mira!\n\nHe wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small\nwhirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in\nthe flick of an eye.\n\nTONY\n...the fuck was that?\n\nMANNY\nYou didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.\n\nDoes it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head\npeeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.\n\nTONY\nWhat the hell's that for -- eating bugs?

How 'bout that one?\n\nPointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.\n\nMANNY\nNo problem.\n\nEXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY.\n\nTony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arms and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't give a shit.\n\nTONY\nCome on!\n\nManny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a\ncar screeching to a halt in front of him.\n\nTONY\n(points)\nOkay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.\n\nThe blonde has paused to look in a shop window.\n\nManny stops alongside, -pretends to look. When he catches\nher eyes, he flicks his tongue.\n\nShe looks at him, confused, then back into the window.\nManny looks back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.\n\nTony, exiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber\nchild, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his\nown version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at\nhim puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now\nsmiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles and moves along.\n\nMeanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde socks him across the face and walks away.\n\nTony walks up to him, mocking.\n\nTONY\nI'm telling you man you got it- all mixed up.\nThis country first, you gotta get the money; then you get the power, and when you got the power, then you get the women -- then, chico, you got the world by the balls.

TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - SOUTHWEST MIAMI - LATE DAY\nThe house, bathed by a torpid setting sun amicable to lizards and Spanish moss, sits undistinguished and without shielding trees in the midst of a lower middle class neighborhood with look-alike yards and streets without people.\n\n66 INT.

Mother looks behind her.\nShe opens the door, looks back as if she has no choice.\nHe steps in. He looks.\n\n68 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nThe interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled\nwith religious objects from macumba and waist-high black\nJesus statues in various corners. The floor is without rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.\n\nStepping forward to the center of the living room like a cautious cat is his nineteen-year-old sister Gina. Their eyes lock.\n\nTONY\n(moved)\nHi Gina...\n\nGINA\nTony?\n\nShe looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,\ncurly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and\nlarge-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.\n(She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in\nTony's possession.)\n\nTONY\n(covering his unwanted emotion)\nYeah, look at you, you're beautiful... what's it been seven years? Last time I saw you, you looked like a boy. Now look at you, you got great big eyes just like me!

Tony pulls\nout another present, for her.\n\nTONY\n...for you too Mama, look....\n\nMoving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an\nexquisite pearl necklace. She stares at it, doesn't take it. Gina comes over, takes it for her.\n\nGINA\nIt's beautiful... Mama,\n(offers it, an unspoken 'why don't you take it?')\n\nMama doesn't. Gina puts it away with her own.\n\nTONY\n(holding Gina by the shoulder, making light of it)\nWell anyway, here we are hunh? The three musketeers! We made it to America hunh?

So leave us alone... go on, get out! And take this lousy\nmoney with you, it stinks!\n\nShe casts the bundle of bills back across the table at him\nlike dead lettuce.\n\nA silence.

GOLF COURSE - MIAMI - DAY 86\nFrank Lopez has Tony and Chi-Chi out on the golf course. Tony never played before and gets frustrated, swings his club at the ball like a baseball bat -- Lopez getting a kick out of him.

He slaps it on the rear fender. It's the same sticker we saw earlier of the American flag with the epitaph, \"Will the Last American leaving Miami please bring the flag.\"\n\nElvira wonders about it as he joins her.\n\nTONY\nSomebody gotta keep the animals out.\n\n92 EXT. LUXURY MOTORS - DAY 92\nTony leads her to his yellow Cadillac convertible parked out of eyesight of the others.\n\nTONY\nI'm glad you came.

Does a toot,\nstaring at her. She's uncomfortable. When he finishes he ,\nmakes as if to return it to her. She leans to take it. He\nkisses her. She goes with it.\n\nPause. She pulls back.\n\nELVIRA\n(same tone of voice as before)\nDon't get confused, Tony. I don't fuck around with the help.\n\nAs he puts the key into the ignition, Tony has this wolfish grin on his face.\n\nCUT TO\nINT. COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93\nSubtitle appears:\n\nCOCHABAMBA, BOLIVA\nAlejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy\nhair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a\ncasual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.\n\nOn his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with \"Alex' written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money.\n\nAccompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense\nvenomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the\nlook of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in\nproximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person\nor persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte\nposition, his eyes swiveling to stare down the person who\nmight glance at him. He is a continual source of tension\nunderplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar\nwho is insecure to begin with.\n\nSosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing\nlab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with massive iron\nkettles bubbling with coca paste... across to a row of ovens\nwhere the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians\nworking there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey\" as he passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard.\n\nSOSA\nSo this and my other factory can guarantee production of 200\nkilos refined every month of the year. Problem is, I have no steady\nmarket. Some months I can't get rid of fifty keys, other months I have to do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh? Nobody can run a business that way ---\n\nOMAR\nI know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month...\n\nSosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his\nskinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his\nnervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.\n\nTony, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to\nlook at a sample of the dried coke.\nThe Shadow stops, eyeballs him.\n\nTony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then\nsamples the coke off his thumb into his nose.\nPause. His expression says I like it. He moves on.\nThe Shadow moves with him.\n\nSOSA\n(meanwhile)\n...Basically what I'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like -- say 150 kilos a month.\n\nOMAR\nThat's a big commitment Mr. Sosa. It's too bad Frank's not here. Something like that you should talk to him.\n\nSOSA\nYes, it would've been nice if he could have come.\n\nTONY\n(cutting in)\nand he'd like meeting you too Mr. Sosa. But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand?\n\nSOSA\n(taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic)\nSo he sent you?\n\nTONY\nYeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit.\n\nLooking over the laboratory like it was his.\nOmar glances at him, annoyed.\n\nSOSA\nWe'll talk at my house. Shall we go...\n\nCUT TO\n94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94\nThe camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains\nto a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings\nfrom the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.\nAt the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.\nHe eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, constantly hanging dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).\n\nSOSA\n(to Omar)\n...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.\n\nOMAR\nWell, we do that, we gotta take the\nrisk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You\nknow what that means?\n\nTONY\nThat means we gotta go to war with\n`em.\nlooks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make\nSosa\nof this guy.\nSOSA\nWhen we cut out the Colombians we take risks -- on both sides.\n\nTONY\nSplit the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama.\n\nSOSA\nPanama? Risky? It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key.\n\nTONY\n13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You\nknow what that's like these days?\nThey got the Navy all over the fuckin' place. They got frogmen, they got EC2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads. It's no duckwalk for us anymore, y'know. Forget it.\n\nOmar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.\n\nSOSA\nWhat do you suggest is a fair...?\nExcuse me.\n\nInterrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly\nappears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves\nhim in.\n\nThe black aide -- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man\nwith academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair\non a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression.\n\nSosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.\nA beat.\nHe whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.\nThen he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.\nSosa glances at his gold Rolex.\n\nOMAR\n(meanwhile, in a whisper to Tony)\nShaddup willya Montana, I'm doing the talking here!\n\nTony shrugs.\n\nSOSA\nWhere were we?\n\nTONY\nPanama. You're looking for a partner, right?\n\nOmar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.\n\nSOSA\n...something like that.\n(chuckles)\n\nOMAR\nLook Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we...\n\nTONY\nHey Omar, why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition.\n\nOMAR\nHey Montana, you got no authority here, okay! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UP!\n\nTONY\n(shrugs)\nFrank'll love it. Don't worry about it.\n\nOMAR\nThat's up to Frank -- not you.\n\nHe looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing\n-- also an advantage in the split.\n\nOMAR\nI'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa...\n\nSOSA\nIt's all right. Maybe your partner's right. Maybe you should talk to\nFrank.\n\nOMAR\n(a beat)\nOkay. I don't think this is something I want to do on an overseas phone, but I can go back to Miami and talk to Frank personally.\n\nSOSA\n(without hesitation)\nGood. My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz now. I have a jet there that'll have you in Miami in five hours.\nYou can be back here tomorrow. For lunch.\n\nOmar is taken aback by the speed of the plan.\n\nOMAR\nYeah. I guess so....\n\nTONY\nGreat.\n\nSOSA\n(glancing at Tony, to Omar)\n...leave your friend here. While you're gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business.\n\nOMAR\n(doesn't get it)\nI don't think that...\n\nTONY\n(lighting a cigar)\nHey, it's okay. You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him...\n\nSosa laughs. Omar scowls.\n\nCUT TO\n\n95 EXT. SOSA VILLA - DAY 95\n\nThe helicopter blades whirr. The Skull waits inside with the Shadow. They both stare at:\nOmar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.\n\nThe chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the\npolo players exercising in the distance... a woman on a\nhorse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.\n\nSosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.\n\nTONY\nYou know why they say Cubans are all screwed up?\n\nSOSA\nWhy?\n\nTONY\nCause the island's in the Caribbean, the government's in Russia, the Army's in Angola, and the people live in Miami.\n\nSosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.\n\nTONY\n(overlapping the joke)\nThey got a beard there that's all. With a cigar and a big mouth.\n\nSOSA\nMaybe he'll move to Miami too...\nGabriella, my rose -- how was the ride?\n\nSosa changes his personality completely with her, dewy-eyed and loving. They peck each other's cheek lightly.\n\nGABRIELLA\n(distracted)\nLovely... but the sheep in the north pasture, they're destroying the grass, it's turning yellow. You must move them darling.\n\nSOSA\nI'll take care of it myself.\n\nGABRIELLA\n(turning to him)\n...and don't forget we have the Rinaldi's at eight.\n\nSOSA\nOf course not. Uh -- an associate of mine. From Miami. Tony Montana...\n(to Tony)\nMy fiance, Gabriella Montini.\n\nTONY\nHello....\nShe nods to him in that somewhat uninterested, rude, upperclass Latin way.\n\nGABRIELLA\nIt's a pleasure.\n\nShe withdraws. Tony watches her go.\n\nTONY\nI gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want.\n\nSosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the helicopter rising off the lawn.\n\nSOSA\n(focusing the binoculars)\nI like you Tony. There's no lying in you... Unfortunately I don't feel\nthe same way about the rest of your organization.\n\nTony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.\n\nTONY\nIn-- l -- Whaddaya getting at, Mr. Sosa?\n\nSOSA\nI mean Omar Suarez.\n\nTony, puzzled, glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate.\n\nSosa passes him the binoculars.\n\nSOSA\nThis garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch.\nFrom several years ago, in New York. He was an informer for the police....\n\nTony, astonished, looks up.\n\n96 THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - OMAR 96\nterrified, being positioned at the door of the chopper by\nthe Shadow and the Skull, his hands tied to his back and a\nlength of thick rope looped around his neck. He is struggling backwards in vain.\n\nSOSA\nHe put Vito Duval and the Ramos Brothers -- Nello and Gino -- away for life. My associate used to work up there.\n\nThrough the binoculars -- they throw Omar out of the\nchopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut, snapping his neck. He hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.\nA silence.\n\n\n97 TONY 97\nshaken, lowers the binoculars.\nSosa watches him closely for his reaction.\nTony looks back at him, contemplative.\nSosa goes over, pours himself some coffee.\n\nSOSA\nSo how do I know you're not a 'chivato' too Tony?\n\nTONY\n(awry, stalks up to him)\nHey Sosa -- get this straight right now ! I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it comin' to him okay! All I got's my two balls-- and my word -- and I don't break 'em. For nobody.\nThat piece of shit up there I never liked, I never trusted..\nFor all I know he's the guy who set me up and got my buddy Angel Fernandez killed.\nBut that's history. I'm here. He's not. You wanna go on with me, say it. You don't, make your move, hodedor!\n\nSOSA\n(moves away)\nI think you speak from the heart Montana, but I say to myself this\nLopez -- your boss -- he has 'chivatos' like that working for him, his judgment stinks. So I think to myself, what other mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organization...hunh? You tell me Tony.\n\nTONY\nHey Frank's smart. Don't blame him for that animal. It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know. I'll talk to Frank myself. I'll fix this thing up right between you.\n(then)\nYou got my word on that.\n\nSosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him,\nmakes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony\nfollowing the pantomime, puts his out. Sosa now grips them.\n\nSOSA\nYou speak with your eyes muchacho. I think -- you and I -- we can work this thing out, do business a long time together. Just remember -- it's the only thing I ever tell you -- don't fuck me Tony, don't ever try to fuck me.\n\nTheir eyes locked together.\n\nCUT TO\nAERIAL VIEW - MIAMI - TWILIGHT 98\nIn all its Caribbean splendor with the long curving beach\nand rich white buildings, bathed in a lovely violet light.\nMusic theme continuing over.\n\nREVERSE WIPE TO\n\n99 EXT. LOPEZ MOTORS AUTO DEALERSHIP - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY 99\nIn long shot we see an agitated Lopez entering his dealership with his bodyguard. Against a background of used American cars without great distinction, he ad-libs his way through some customers and salesmen, shaking hands and acting like everybody's favorite uncle... 'till we see him approach Tony, who is waiting for him with Manny\noutside his office.\nHe jerks his head. Inside. They go.\n\nCUT TO\n100 INT. AUTO LOPEZ OFFICE - DAY 100\nThe office is highly decorated with plagues, mementos,\nCuban patriot flags, and lots of photographs, centering on\nJFK and RFK shaking the hand of Lopez who now stares\nincredulously at Tony.\n\nLOPEZ\n(livid)\nYou what!

He's gonna send hit squads up here that's what. There's gonna be war in the streets.\n\nTONY\nFrank... Frank...\n\nLOPEZ\n(ranting)\nYou know what this fucking trial is costing me in legal fees, Montana?\n...You expect me to believe Omar was a stoolie.\nCause Sosa said so? And' you bought that line?\n(pause, eyeing Tony)\nMaybe I made a mistake sending you down there? Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know?\n\nTONY\nYou saying I'm not being straight with you Frank?\n\nLopez's bodyguard shifts. Manny slips his hand closer to his belt.\n\nLOPEZ\n(carefully)\nLet's just say I want things to stay the way they are. For now. Stall\nyour deal with Sosa.\n\nLong pause. Tony's eyes meeting Lopez's. He gave Sosa his word.\n\nTONY\n(finally)\n...have it your way boss.\n\nHe turns to leave, nods to Manny.\n\nLOPEZ\nMontana... just remember I am the boss.\n\nTONY\nSure you're the boss.\n\nGets to the door, Manny joining him.\n\nLOPEZ\nY'know I told you when you started Tony, the guys who last in this business are guys who fly straight, real low key, real quiet.. -the guys who want it all, the chicks and the champagne and the flash -- they don't last.\n\nTony saying nothing, goes out the door with Manny.\n\n101 EXT.

What about Metro, Lauderdale, DEA -- how do I know what rock they're gonna come out from under?\n\nBERNSTEIN\nThat's none of our business, Tony, we don't cross no lines.\n(getting up)\nI don't want this discussion going any farther than this table.

I'll go out with who I want and if I want to fuck them then I'll fuck them!\n\nTony, raging, smacks her the face. She reels back across into the toilet.\nTony stands there, abated.\n\nThe crowd is silent.\n\nManny moves across the floor and kneels down, consoles Gina who is sobbing.\n\nMANNY\n(tender)\nCome on, baby, it's okay... it's okay, he didn't mean it.\n(strokes her face)\n\nTONY\n(disturbed, to Manny)\nGet her home, get her outta here!\n\nHe turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd,\nno regrets, but disturbed.\n\nManny helps Gina to her feet.\n\nMANNY\nCome on, pussycat, I'll buy you a\ncup of coffee.\n\nCUT TO\n110 INT.

Cause you don't know what you're missing....\n\nShe leans across the front seat and lightly lays a challenging kiss on his cheek. The ladykiller is rigid in his terror.\n\nShe gets out of the car, crosses in front of his headlights, towards the house, looking at him. He watches.\n\nCUT BACK TO\n113 INT. BABYLON CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT 113\nThe Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting to Sinatra's \"Strangers In The Night'.\n\nOWNER\nAll right, you coneheads, another exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh?\nNow I want you to check out this next hombre. I found him stoned in the jungle and there's nothing you'll ever see like him. I present with great pride, from Caracas, Venezuela -- 'Octavia' !\n\nLights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as\nsad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-\nlight drawing immediate laughter.\n\nHe is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo\nmask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.\nWith a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to \"Saturday Night Fever\" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.\n\nTony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.\nMore laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.\nWhen the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome\nface of a young clown in white paint with the large\nblackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing\naudience.\n\nTony is hooked by the image, looks on.\nThe clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and\npulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,\nbouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry...\n\n...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the\nsharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to\nits close, a haunting figure of mockery....\n\nTony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time. His\nantennae warn him. Out of the side of his eye, he sees....\n\nThe two hitters moving on him.\nHe sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,\nsmashing the mirrors...\nScreams, crowd diving for cover...\n\nTony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Beretta out of\nhis ankle, firing...\nHits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings...\n\nTony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing...\nThe second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more\nmirrors, and more screaming.\n\nTony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the\ndoor, his clothes ripped with blood and glass.\n\nThe clown, Octavia, lies dead on the silent dance floor.\n\nCUT TO\n114 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 114\nTony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.\n\nExchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking lot, he runs out of ammunition.\nHe jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.\n\nThe second hitter, wounded, running out of the club towards him.\nThe third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.\n\nTony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.\n\nCarhops scattering, the hitters seeking cover.\nHitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head exploding like squashed watermelon.\n\nTony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap\nacross the shattered windows.\nHe guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off\nthe armor plating, whining against the shutters.\n\nTony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the\ngear shift into reverse. In an instant, his warmobile in reverse, accelerates, climbing to top speed...\nAs hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of\nthere, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.\n\nCUT TO\n\n115 INT. SAFEHOUSE - THAT NIGHT 115\nTony, aching from his wound, is attended by a Doctor, who\nreveals to us an ugly wound on his rib cage.

What'd you do -- fix the umpire?\n\nLopez, his nose in a glass of scotch, almost muffs it right\nthere and then, but manages to recover.\n\nLOPEZ\nTony...? Uh, I'll call you back -- yeah.\n\nHangs the phone up and rocks forward at his desk.\nLopez's bodyguard, Ernie, gets the message from Chi-chi\nsliding along the wall next to him, Manny covering the\nother side of the room.\n\nLOPEZ\nTony... what happened to you, hunh?\n\nTONY\nYeah, lookit. They spoiled one of\nmy $800 suits.\n\nLOPEZ\nJesus! Who?\n\nin his ripped suit, shoulder in a sling, face cut, Tony, shifts his eyes with camera slowly onto Mel Bernstein sitting there with a bourbon on the rocks, his two hundred and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise.\n\nTONY\nHitters. Somebody musta brought 'em.\nNever seen 'em before...Hiya\nii:;. Is there an answer to this too?\n\nBERNSTEIN\n(uneasy)\nAlways is Montana, always is...\n\nLOPEZ\nJesus, Tony, maybe it was the Diaz Brothers, they got a deep beef going back to the 'Sun Ray' thing.\n\nTONY\nHey, you might be right.\n\nLOPEZ\nAnyway I'm glad you made it Tony, we'll return the favor for you. In spades.\n\nTONY\n(sits at the edge of Lopez's desk)\nNah, I'm gonna take care of this myself.\n\nPause.\n\nLOPEZ\n(awkward)\nWell... What are the guns for Tony?\n\nTONY\n(shrugs)\nWhat for? I'm paranoid I guess.\n\nThe phone rings.\nLopez lets the phone ring.\n\nTONY\nWhy don't you answer it Frank?\n\nLOPEZ\nMust be Elvira. You know women.\nAfter we left that joint she....\n\nThe phone rings again.\n\nTONY\n(reaches for it)\nI'll tell her you're not here.\n\nLOPEZ\n(grabs the phone first)\nWait a minute! I'll talk to her... Hello?...\n(anxious)\nYeah... all right honey, don't worry... I'll be home in an hour.\n\nHe hangs up. Pause.\n\nTONY\nFrank, you're a piece of shit.\n\nLOPEZ\nWhatcha talking 'bout Tony?\n\nTony, angry now, grabs Lopez by the shirt and hauls him\nforward across his desk so his gut lies flat across it.\n\nTONY\nYou know what I'm talking about you fuckin' cockroach!\n\nLOPEZ\nTony, no! Lissen!\n\nTONY\nYou remember what a 'haza' is Frank?\nIt's a pig that don't fly straight. Neither do you, Frank.\n\nLOPEZ\n(nervous)\nWhy would I hurt you, Tony, I brought you in!

Three times.\nLopez crashes backwards, draped over his desk like Marat in\nhis bathtub, amid his patriot flag and his Kennedy photographs.\n\nTONY\n...Every dog has his day.\n\nHe fixes his eyes on Mel Bernstein.\n\nBERNSTEIN\n(remaining calmly in his chair)\nI told him it didn't make sense -- killing you when he coulda had you working for us instead. But he got hot tonight, y'know, about the broad. He fucked up.\n\nTONY\nYeah, so did you, Bernstein.\n\nHis eyes... Bernstein, reading them, gets worried.\n\nBERNSTEIN\nNow wait a minute, Montana, don't go too far.\n\nTONY\nI'm not Mel.

The IRS is coming down heavy on South Florida, y'know. That Time Magazine cover didn't help any.

How's married life? Say hello to the princess for me -- okay. She's beautiful.\nSee you. Take care.\n\nGoing.\n\nTony watches, raging inside.

It\nsells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper-- about human rights!\n\nINTERVIEWER\nI've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in Bolivia.\n\nGUTIERREZ\nThe irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions,\nJim - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.\n\nINTERVIEWER\nSo what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine... that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?\n\nGUTIERREZ\n(laughs)\nLet me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim... my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --\n\nGutierrez holds up a photograph -- insert the face on the TV\nscreen, dour, ruthless.\n\nGUTIERREZ\n. . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country. Two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.\nNow if he's supposed to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what's he doing living in Switzerland? Guarding the cash register?\n\nLaughter.\n\n169 TONY 169\nwatching, touching his nose a lot, blowing it, hyped from\nthe coke usage.\n\nSOSA\nA Communist -- financed by Moscow.\n\n170 GUTIERREZ 170\nholds up another photograph -- insert the face on the\nTV screen.\n\nGUTIERREZ\n...this is Alejandro Sosa. Interesting character. A wealthy landowner. Educated in England. Good family. The business brain and drug overlord of an empire stretching across the Andes. Not your ordinary drug dealer....\n\nINTERVIEWER\nWhat are you suggesting we do about this, Doctor?\n\nGUTIERREZ\n(passionate)\nThe United States Government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do. You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.\n\n171 TONY 171\nstaring intently at him, reluctantly impressed.\n\nGUTIERREZ\nYou Americans have no idea how important your country is as a\nsymbol and a bastion of those rights. You have no....\n\nSosa flips off the television. The lights come on. He's alone with Tony.\n\nSOSA\n...he's scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him. He's embarrassing, Tony...\nThat's our problem.\n\nTONY\nYeah.\n\nSosa looks up.\n\nThe Shadow (seen before at the disposal of Omar) comes into\nthe room, thin and quiet, his venomous eyes flicking over\nTony. The Skull leads him in.\n\nSOSA\nYou've met Alberto before?...\n\nTONY\n(remains seated)\nSure. How could I forget?\n\nSOSA\nAlberto, you know Tony Montana -- my partner from Florida.\n\nAlberto nods icily, remains standing adjacent.\n\nSOSA\n(to Tony)\nSo you see Alberto here is going to help fix our problem. Alberto, you know, is an expert in the disposal business -- but he doesn't know his way around the States too well, he doesn't speak English, and he needs a little help...\n(*en)\nIs that a problem, Tony?\n\nTony looks around the faces, then:\n\nTONY\nThat's no problem, Alex....\n\nAlex nods, pleased.\nHold on Tony. He blows his nose again.\n\nCUT TO\n\n175 INT. THE RESTAURANT - MIAMI - NIGHT\nA millionaire's place, like \"The Forge\" on Arthur Godfrey\nRoad. Tony, Elvira, and Manny are shown to their table by the maitre d'. Tony, a little loaded, intersects a group of people at another table and stops, putting his hand on a heavyset man's shoulder.\n\nTONY\nHey, Vic, I watch your show everyday.\n\nVic -- who we saw before editorializing on television.--\ncranes his leonine white head of hair around with a\npatrician annoyance reserved for bores in restaurants.\n\nVIC\nOh, is that so?\n\nTONY\nYeah. Hey, you know that two hundred kilo DEA bust you was congratulating the cops for on the toob the other night?\n\nVIC\nAren't you... Tony Montana?\n\nTONY\n(beaming now, ignoring Manny who comes to retrieve him)\nYeah, that's me.\n\nThe half-dozen rich people in the dinner party are intrigued.\n\nTONY\n(waves to them)\nHi folks, don't get up. Anyway, Vic, check it out. I heard like it was 220 kilos went down. That means twenty is missing, right? Ask your friends, the cops, about that -- and keep up the good work, Vie, but don't believe everything you hear, y'know what I mean? Okay, have a good dinner, nice to meet you people.\n\nWaves farewell to them, pats Vic once more on the shoulder, and leaves them murmuring.\n\nMANNY\n(reproving)\nHey, Tony, that's not cool, he's got a lotta friends in....\n\nTONY\nI don't give a fuck. He's an ass-hole! Never fucking tells the truth on TV! That's the trouble in this country. Nobody fucking tells the truth!\n\nNot caring if he's overheard, Tony seems to be in the grip\nof an anguish he does not understand.\n\nCUT TO\n\n173 TONY\nsits with Manny and Elvira, who is dipping into a vial of coke in the purse in her lap. Another huge meal is being consumed, the best roast beef, bottles of red and white wine, cigars....\n\nMANNY\nSo what's the big mystery, what happened down there with Sosa?\n\nTONY\nLot of bullshit, that's what. Politics.\nThe whole world's turning into politics.\n\nHe pulls out his own vial under the table between eating and drinking.\n\nMANNY\nThe one thing we always stayed out of was politics, Tony.\n\nTONY\nYeah, so what do you think Emilio Rebenga was? Politics or what?\n\nManny remembers.\n\nTONY\nNo free rides in this world, kid.\n\nMANNY\nSo who's this guy you brought back with you, the guy who don't blink?\n\nELVIRA\nWhat guy?\n\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nYou stay out of it. Run things down here. I'll be up in New York next week.\n\nHe takes a hit, unnoticed.\n\nELVIRA\n(unheard)\nWhat guy?\n\nMANNY\n(to Tony)\nI don't like it.\n\nTONY\nYou don't like it! It was you got me into this mess in the first place with that fuckin' Seidelbaum!\n\nWhat's Seidelbaum got to do with this?\nTony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the\ntable with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to\nElvira's untouched plate.\n\nTONY\nWhy don't you eat your food, what's\nwrong with it?\n\nELVIRA\nI'm not hungry.\n\nShe quickly does one nostril with a quick, practiced move-\nment of her hand.\n\nTONY\nSo what'd you order it for?\n\nELVIRA\nI lost my appetite.\n\nShe does the other nostril. Tony looking at her. One beat.\nTwo beats. He passes a silent burp.\n\nMANNY\n(trying to shift the mood)\nSo what about the trial? I heard Sheffield thinks he can get a new postponement....\n\nTony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues to look at Elvira, then away, encompassing the restaurant.\n\nTONY\n(ignoring the question)\nIs this it? Is that what it's all about, Manny?\nEating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what?\nYou're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?\nIs that what it's all about?\n\nMANNY\nIt's not so bad Tony, could be worse....\n\nTONY\n(doesn't hear)\n. . . is that what I worked 'for? With these hands? Is that what I killed for? For this?\n(turns his gaze stonily on Elvira)\nA junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for a wife? Who never eats nothing, who wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps all day with black shades on, who won't fuck me cause she's in a coma!\n\nMANNY\n(gently)\nTony, you're drunk.\n\nTONY\n...is this how it ends? And I thought I was a winner? Fuck it\nman, I can't even have a fucking kid with her, her womb's so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby!\n\nElvira reacts -- wanting to kill. She gets up and dumps\nher plate filled with food on him. Slop drips all over him.\n\nELVIRA\nYou sonufabitch! You fuck!\n\nThey got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping\naround to clean up the mess. Tony slowly wiping the food\noff himself.\n\nELVIRA\nHow dare you talk to me like that!\nYou call yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?\nOh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming!\n\nThe audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over\nthe faces of Vie and his rich friends.\n\nTony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.\n\nTONY\nSit down before I kill you.\n\nELVIRA\n. . . You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony. But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons\naround all the time? I have Nick the Pig as a friend? What kind of life is that Tony? What kind of life is that?\n(in a softer tone)\nOh Tony don't you see? Don't you see what we've become? We're losers, honey, we're not winners, we're losers...\n\nSilence. Tony's fury has passed. So has Elvira's. There's\nthis awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot\ntheir lines.\n\nTONY\n(softly)\nGo on, get a cab home, you're stoned.\n(to Manny)\nManny.\n\nELVIRA\nNo, I'm not stoned Tony. You're stoned. You're so stoned you don't\neven know it.\n\nTONY\nAll right I'm stoned.\n\nMANNY\n(rising, trying to put his arm on Elvira)\nCome on, baby.\n\nELVIRA\nNo, no you stay right there Manny, I'm not going home with you... I'm not going home with anybody. I'm going home alone...\n(staring at Tony)\nI'm leaving you. I don't need this shit anymore.\n\nPause. She starts wobbling out.\nPast the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony. Manny rises to follow.\n\nTONY\nLet her go! ...Another Quaalude and she'll love me again.\n\nStumbling once, Elvira disappears out the door.\nTony's eyes follow her. Pause.\n\nThe whole room is watching him sitting there covered with\nfood, the silence cathedral. He stands, wiping at the food\nand throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,\nthen looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.\n\nTONY\nYou're all assholes. You know why?\nCause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be.\n\nHe wobbles against the table. Manny tries to help. Tony\nshakes him loose.\n\nTONY\nYou need people like me so you can point your fingers and say 'hey there's the bad guy!' So what does that make you? Good guys? Don't kid yourselves. You're no better'n me. You just know how to hide -- and how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. I always tell the truth -- even when I lie.\n\nHe starts out, staggers.\n\nTONY\nSo say good night to the bad guy...\nYou're never gonna see a bad guy like me again.\n\nHe walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room\nis empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without\nits star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror\nand delight.\n\nCUT TO\n174 EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT\nA quiet East Eighties street. Two rich-looking male lovers\nstroll past with their dog. A moment of silence. Tony\nmoves into frame.\n\nBehind him, the Shadow (Alberto) moves towards a sedan\nparked along the curb, carrying an airline bag. Be slips\nunder the car.\n\nTony looks:\n\n175 ERNIE\ndown the street at the intersection of the avenue, surveying\ntraffic, signals okay.\n\n176 CHI-CHI\nwaits in Tony's sedan double-parked down the block.\n\nTony, feeling everything's okay, does .a nervous, quick\nsnort, paces next to the vehicle the Shadow disappeared\nunder.\n\nGround level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes\nthe bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the\ncamera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,\ntaped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of\nthe Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an\naxle of the car.\n\n177 ERNIE\nsignals.\n\n178 TONY\nsees it.\n\nA cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,\ntowards us.\n\nGround level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.\nTony hurries to the car, bends down.\n\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nPsst! La Jara! Apaga.\n\nThe Shadow douses it and freezes in position.\n\nTony looks up just as the cop car pulls alongside, the\npassenger cop, a female, noticing him, saying something to her partner who eases the car to a halt.\n\nTony hurries out into the street, taking the initiative.\n\nTONY\nHey officer, uh you haven't seen a little dog have you, a little white poodle, it's around here somewhere?\nJesus, my kid's gonna go crazy when he hears I lost 'im. Oh boy am I gonna be in trouble.\n\nFEMALE COP\nWhy don't you check the ASPCA okay? They handle that stuff....\n\nTONY\nThe ASPCA? What's that? ...Jesus, that's not the place where they chop these dogs up is it?\n\nFEMALE COP\n(in a hurry)\nLook it up in the Yellow Pages okay, buddy.\n(signal to her partner, they drive off)\n\nTony looks at them go, takes another snort, walks over to\nthe car, bangs on the hood several times.\n\nTONY\nHey smiley, come on outta there, you're under arrest!\n\n178 CONTINUED 178\nPause. The Shadow, unsmiling, appears from under the car.\ngun drawn, glowing with perspiration. When he realizes it's\na joke, his eyes blaze at Tony.\n\nSHADOW\n(Spanish)\nWhat the fuck you doing!\n\nTONY\n(winks)\nHey that was close, hunh?\n\nCUT TO\n179 EXT.

Furious he slams it back down, stalks back out to the sidewalk.\n\n183 OMITTED 183\n\n184 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 184\nHe gets in the driver'6 seat. The Shadow's next to him\nwith the radio transmitter, Chi-Chi, in the back.

A moment of despair. Then he snorts\nanother spoon and snaps back.\n\nCUT TO\n211 EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT 211\nPlane taking off.\n\nCUT TO\n212 EXT. TONY'S MANSION - THAT NIGHT 212\nTony drives up in a white Corniche (the red Jaguar having been shot to shreds earlier in Lopez's attempt on Tony's life) with Chi-Chi, jumps out in the same bloodstained clothes, rushes in.\n\n213 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 213\nErnie meets them at the door.\n\nTONY\nHear from Manny?\n\nERNIE\nNo Tony. Your mama called again.\nShe gotta see you.

Okay?\n\nERNIE\nRight, Tony.\n\nTony stalks off, towards his office.\n\n214 INT. TONY'S OFFICE\n\nAmid his computer space games and half-dozen televisions\nand stereos, Tony picks up the ringing phone.\n\nTONY\nYeah? Hi. Mami.\n\nHer voice on the phone sounds hysterical and angry.\nThe other phone is ringing.\nNot really listening, Tony breaks open a new vial, pours the entire vial of coke out across the desk into a thick quarter-moon pattern. He snorts.\n\nChi-Chi signals he's got Sosa on the other line.\n\nTONY\n(into the phone)\nYeah, all right. I hear you. I'll be there!\nNo problem, okay.\n\nHe hangs up, snorts, then pushes the button Chi-Chi indicates.\nThe telephone should be the latest in gimmickry.\n\nTONY\n. . . so whaddaya say Alex?\n\nPause. The voice at the other end is very controlled, very\ncold.\n\nSOSA'S VOICE\nSo what happened Tony?\n\nTONY\n(casual)\nOh we had some problems.\n\nSOSA'S VOICE\nYeah, I heard.\n\nTONY\nHow'd you hear?\n\nSOSA'S VOICE\nCause our friend gave a speech today at the UN.

You blew it, you fuckin' dumb cocksucker!\n\nTONY\nHey, you don't talk to me like that!\nWho do you ---\n\nSQSA' S VOICE\n(simultaneous)\nI told you a long time ago, you little fuckin' monkey, not to fuck me and....\n\nTony holding the mouthpiece away from his ear and talking at it like it was a face.\n\nTONY\nWho the fuck you think you're talkin' to, hunh! Whatta you think\nI am? Your fuckin' slave! You don't tell me what to do, Sosa. You ' re\nshit! You want a war, you got it?\n\nSlams the phone down.\n\nTONY\nThe fucking nerve of that guy!\n\nIn the cavernous silence of the room, he listlessly turns to another line of coke.\n\nCUT TO\n215 EXT. MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 215\nTony in the backseat in his white Corniche staring straight\nahead. Ernie driving, Chi-Chi with him.\n\n216 EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - SOUTHWEST MIAMI - NIGHT 216\nThe bulletproof white Corniche pulls up, Ernie and Chi-Chi\ngetting out first, checking the street, Tony following quickly.\n\nTONY\n(to Chi-Chi)\nYou try Manny again. Gimme five minutes.\n\nHe hurries towards the house.\n\n217 INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 21:\nMama is angry and ravaged with worry, made weaker than\npreviously, as if overwhelmed by events.\n\nMAMA\n. she got a place of her own, she don't tell me where. One day I follow her in a taxi. She goes into this fancy house in Coconut Grove.\n\nTONY\nThe Grove? Where'd she get that kinda money?\n\nYou ! You were giving her the money, what do you think -- don't you see what you do to her, don't you....\n\nTONY\nI never gave her that kinda money.\n\nMAMA\nYes, you did! One time. One thousand dollars you gave her!...\n\nTONY\nMama, was there a guy with hex?\n\nMAMA\nI don't know, there was this other car in the driveway. I know if I went in there, she'd kill me, she's like you, she....\n\nTony's face filling with the old wrath, he grips his mother\nby the shoulders.\n\nTONY\nWhere's this house, tell me!\n\nMAMA\nCitrus Drive. Four hundred something.\nFour hundred nine. You gotta talk to her Tony, she don't listen to me anymore. She says to me 'Shut up! Mind your own business.'\nExactly like you do to me. Ever since you come back, she's been getting this way.\n\nHe turns to leave but she clings to his arm.\n\nMAMA\nDon't you see what you do to her?\nDon't you see? Why do you have to hurt everything you touch, why do you....\n\nTONY\n(shakes himself loose, turns on her)\nNo! You know why she left, Mama?\nNot cause of me. Cause of you.\n\nMAMA\nMe?\n\nTONY\nYeah, it's you drove her nuts withyour nagging and bitchin'.\n\nMAMA\n(interrupts)\nNagging and bitchin'? I only demand a little respect and dignity in this house, is that why I am nagging and bitchin'?\n\nTONY\n(continuing)\n...and you did the same thing to me. I wasn't this, I wasn't that --\nnever good enough for you. I never felt nothing from you, Mama -- nothing!\n\nMAMA\n(interrupts)\n. . . because I was putting food on the table, because I suffered for both of you....\n\nTONY\nFirst time I ever needed you, where were you?. . .\n\nMAMA\nWhere was I?\n\nTONY\n...when I was in that Army jail in Cuba, rotting my ass off, not once.\nI hadda come out into the fuckin' streets to find out my mother and my sister are gone from my house, they left the country, not one word, one letter, that's right.- Where were you?\n\nMAMA\n(interrupts)\nYou ! ..sin verguenza. From the time you were five, you gave me heartbreak and humiliation and shame....\n\nTONY\nThat's right! That's right. What did you expect!\n\nMAMA\n(interrupts)\n.that's what you brought into this\ni&use. If I were to listen to you, you would convert my house into your gangster headquarters....\n\nTONY\nWhat do you expect now? To be loved?\nYou got no love in you, Mama.\nWhat do you think Papi left for? And Gina? At least I didn't walk around with my head hanging down between my legs my whole fuckin' life. Like Papi -- like the way you made Papi feel. I made something outta my life. I'm somebody and I'm proud of it.\n\nMAMA\n(interrupts)\nSomebody? You're proud? You're a\n(Escoria!)\nnothing. You're an animal!\n\nTony storms out of the door as Mama pursues.\n\nMAMA\nGod help me, what have I done to you?\nYou were a beautiful baby. I used to watch you sleep. So beautiful. How? How, Dies Santo, did you become such a monster, such an ugly little monster....\n\nTony slams the door, we hold a beat on her face -- as if she had finally answered her own questions.\n\n218 EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE 218\nTony stomps into his white Corniche, Ernie discreetly\nclosing the door and getting in with Chi-Chi as Mama rips\nopen her door in b.g. and stands there staring from the\ndoorway -- weeping and staring across the dark. Tony\ntakes a strong hit of coke. The car whistles off.\nCUT TO\n\n219 EXT. HOUSE - COCONUT GROVE - THAT NIGHT 219\nTony in the backseat of the Corniche with Chi-Chi studies\nthe house from across the curb. It's quiet, rich, suburban,\nnot calling attention to itself.\n\nTony, seething, snorts another line of coke laid out on the\ncrystal bar dividing the backseat, and rewed, goes.\n\nTONY\n(to Chi-Chi)\nWait here.\n\nHe approaches the front door, listening, the hand sliding into his pocket. Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays over the stereo. He rings a buzzer, waits.\nHold the pause. The door opens casually. Standing there is Manny -- with a towel around his waist.\n\nMANNY\n(surprised)\nTony?\n\nTony stares, stunned.\nGina now comes into view behind Manny -- in a bathrobe, a\nbig smile of welcome for her brother.\n\nGINA\nTony!\n(eyes suddenly moving downward in alarm)\n\nTony with his Beretta pointed at Manny, his expression filled with loathing.\n\nManny smiles easily and shrugs, the gesture drawing Tony over the edge.\n\nMANNY\nHey Tony, c'mon we was....\n\nThe gun fires.\n\nGINA\nTony! No!\n\nTony fires a second time.\nManny slowly slumps downward against the doorjamb, eyes on Tony, terribly surprised.\n\nTony holds the gun, staring down, separated from himself.\nManny lies at his feet, dead.\n\nGINA\nManny!\n\nShe goes down to her knees, stunned out of her mind, shakes him.\n\nGINA\nManny!\n\nShe looks up, insanely, at Tony, her eyes huge with disbelief.\n\nGINA\nYou killed him?\n\nShaking her head at him incredulously.\n\nGINA\nWe got married just yesterday. We were gonna surprise you.\n\nTony stands there, doubly stunned by the news.\n\nGINA\nManolo, oh Manolo, what'd he do?\nWhat'd he do?\n\nShe hugs his corpse tightly to her breast and makes\nhorrible strangled sounds with her throat.\n\nChi-Chi hurrying up to Tony, worried somebody's seen the shooting. Ernie follows.\n\nCHI-CHI\nTony, come on. We gotta get out of here\n(to Gina)\nCome on baby...Gina!\n\nSuddenly she goes berserk.\n\nGINA\nNoooooooooooo!\n\nAnd shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony, screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill him. She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious, numbed.\n\nChi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands. They manage at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to scream.\n\n220 EXT. MANNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 220\nLights coming on in the houses around the neighborhood.\n\nChi-Chi and Ernie, desperate now, drag her forcefully along\nthe pavement into the Corniche. She continues to scream.\n\nERNIE\n(to Chi-Chi)\nGet the body!\n\nTony, back at the door, looks down again.\nThe eyes of Manolo staring sightlessly.\n\nChi-Chi runs back, grabs Tony.\n\nCHI-CHI\nTony!\n\nPulls him. Tony snaps out of it.\n\nTONY\nYeah!\n\nHe goes. Chi-Chi lifting Manny's body, hauling it.\nTony getting into the Corniche, Ernie pinning Gina against the front seat. Chi-Chi propping Manny into the driver's seat with him. The car roars away.\n\nThe camera closing on Gina as she looks through the glass partition of the Corniche, at the slumped head of Manny in foreground, the music surging inexorably.\n\nGINA\nManny! ...Manny! No!\n\nCUT TO -\n221 MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 221\nThe white Corniche whistles by like a hearse heading for hell.\n\n222 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - THAT NIGHT 222\nIt goes roaring by the front gate and up the driveway,\ngravel flying.\n\nThe camera curving to reveal two sedans inching up the\nshadowed street, towards us, their lights out. The cars stop.\nEight men emerge silently, blending into the shadows of the trees.\n\n223 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 223\n\nTony, scratches across his face, strides through the front\ndoor into the marble foyer. Another Marielito is waiting\nfor them at the door.\n\nErnie and Chi-Chi are almost carrying Gina, who is numb with shock.\n\nCHI-CHI\nWhat do we do with her Tony?\n\nTONY\nDo what? Where? Put her upstairs.\nPut her in my bedroom.\n(to Gina)\nIt'll be all right, pussycat, you'll see everything'11 be okay, I'll take\ncare of you....\n\nShe looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his face. Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares, upset but passive.\nThey trundle her up the stairs. Tony turns and walks away.\n\n224 INT. TONY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 224\nTony slumps on his couch. A haze of coke rises off the velvet like a snow scene painting on a Christmas card.\nOblivious to the dust, he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table.\n\nErnie and Chi-Chi come in.\n\nCHI-CHI\nWe got some pills into her, she's cooling down.\n\nTony pays no attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile of coke.\nFlashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table.\nPause as he lets it sink in.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(worried)\nBoss, what we gonna do now?\n\nTONY\nDo? We're gonna war that's what we gonna do.\nWe gonna eat Sosa for breakfast. We're gonna close that\nfucker down.\n\nErnie and Chi-Chi sharing a look.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(eyeing the coke)\nHey Tony, why don't you go easy on that stuff, hunh?\n\nTony looks up at him, focuses. The eyes are uncompromising.\nErnie, a little scared of him now, turns away. Chi-Chi follows.\n\nTony starts on another trek along the coffee table.\n\nCUT TO\n225 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 225\nThe Bengal tiger paces his spot, restless.\nA monsoon-like wind blows through the trees on the estate.\nThe monkeys listen quietly.\nThe flamingoes flutter.\n. . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go...\n\n. . . and we see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate.\n. . . On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the\nbalustrade. He's done so much coke now he's practically\ncatatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.\n\nTONY\n(insensate)\n. . . Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y'self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you, let 'em try, I bury the cocksuckers....\n\nHis point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness echoes back at him. The wind rustling the treetops.\nTony shaking his head at himself, he starts to cry!\n\nTONY\n...Ooooh fuck Manny, how the fuck did I do that? How the fuck! ...oh Manny, Manny ...you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood...\nWell what the hell happened, hunh?\nWhat the hell happened to us?...\n\nIn far background. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see:\n\nThe main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into view, checks the gate, turns. Suddenly two figures spring\nout at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles.\n\nAnother monitor now reveals two more figures moving into\nthe interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito.\n\nA third monitor carries another image of shadows moving\nthrough the trees on the estate.\n\nOn the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost\nincoherent.\n\nTONY\n...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would\nyou sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh -- the fucking best...\n\nAs Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade. A shadow starts climbing up as:\n\nTONY\n...we still are Manny, we still are-- see, I'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I'm gonna run the market, I'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy, you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines. Fan mail. Television stars, movie stars, shooting stars -- he's a star....\n\n\n226 INT. TONY'S MANSION - OFFICE 226\nAs he crosses into his office, the camera moves to reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in the doorway, her eyes blazing with hatred.\nTony sees her.\nShe steps forward, offering her body almost naked to her\nbrother.\n\nGINA\nIs this what you want Tony?...\n\nTony shocked.\n\nGINA\nYou can't stand another man touching me. So you want me Tony, is that it? Well here I am.\n\nShe fires the Baretta we now see in her hand.\n\nThe bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk. She fires again. Again.\n\nGINA\nI'm all yours Tony, I'm all yours now.\n\nBullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals.\n\nGINA\nCome and get me Tony. Before it's too late.\n\nHe spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put\ndistance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, an\nexpression like a demented angel.\n\nGINA\nCome on Tony, fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!\n\nAdvancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair\nspilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony\nsquirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling\nover to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him:\n\nA young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the\nhitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.\nHe doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.\n\nGina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the\nroom, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.\n\nTony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.\nThe punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade.\n\nThe punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds\nat the base of the balcony.\nTony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and\nempties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.\n\nErnie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots Tony, yells up ---\n\nERNIE\nGet outta here!\nTony, they're everywhere!\n\nErnie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of silencer bullets.\n\nWe catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,\nmoving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly\nunderneath the balcony on which Tony stands.\n\nTony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back\ninto his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.\nIt takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face.\n\nTONY\n(gently)\nHey Gina come on, you still angry at me? I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was... I was.\n\nRunning his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids. Blood's running out of her mouth in rivers.\n\nTONY tx:\nCome on Gina, get off the floor.\nYou're all dirty now, you need a bath...\nMami's gonna be angry baby\n-- ooh is she gonna be mad at me!..\nCome on open your eyes my baby,\nopen your eyes.. -give me a smile.\n\nThere's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors.\nOne of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door\npounding it.\n\nCHI-CHI\nBoss ! Hey boss. Open up!\n\nOn the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire\ndown into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade\ngoes off, blows him up against the door.\n\nTONY\nCheeee!\n\nHe now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his\nsideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor.\n\nOn the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the\nfoyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.\nThree of them are already huddled outside the door, around\nthe corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.\n\nTony loading his rocket, intends to beat them to the punch,\ntalking to himself.\n\nTONY\nSo you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.\n\nKarroooomph!\nThe rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian punks off the landing into the foyer.\nIt sounds like Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.\n\nTony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex\nof the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.\n\nTONY\nWhores! Cowards! You think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh?\n\nAnother hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.\n\nTONY\nWho you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes. I take you all to fuckin' hell!\n\nAnother hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.\nA grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing\naway. Laughing like a madman.\n\nTONY\nYou need an army you hear! An army to kill me!\n\nBehind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go\nup in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white. It is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the terrace towards Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun.\n\nTONY\nHa ha ha ha ha! You whores, you scum, I piss in your faces!!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!\n\nThe Skull, now inches from Tony's back, pulls the trigger and blows Tony's spine out his belly.\n\nTony crashes forward over the banister into the interior\nswimming pool below.\n\nHe floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters.\n\nAs the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is\nexpressive salsa with a dash of gaiety.\n\nThe camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters. It says:\n\"THE WORLD IS YOURS\"\nAnd so, for the brief moment, it was.\n\nOur camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool,\npanning past the dream villa, past the shambles and the\nwealth, past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawing\nthat obscene word \"Chivato\" in blood on the outside walls,\npast the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like leaves in autumn, with the looters running after it across the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down Coconut\nGrove -- to the Miami skyline across Biscayne Bay\n\nTHE ENDEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0,

hilles;\nThe quiet life is in the dale below;\nWho tread on ice shall slide against their willes;\nThey want not cares, that curious arts should know.\nWho lives at ease and can content him so,\nIs perfect wise, and sets us all to schoole:\nWho hates this lore may well be called a foole.\"\n\nThomas Churchyard,\n\n\"Shore's Wife,\"\nThe meeting between Deerslayer and his friends in the Ark was grave and anxious.\nThe two Indians, in particular, read in his manner that he was not a successful fugitive, and a few sententious words sufficed to let them comprehend the nature of what their friend had termed his 'furlough.' Chingachgook immediately became thoughtful, while Hist, as usual, had no better mode of expressing her sympathy than by those little attentions which mark the affectionate manner of woman.\n\nIn a few minutes, however, something like a general plan for the proceedings of the night was adopted, and to the eye of an uninstructed observer things would be thought to move in their ordinary train. It was now getting to be dark, and it was decided to sweep the Ark up to the castle, and secure it in its ordinary berth. This decision was come to, in some measure on account of the fact that all the canoes were again in the possession of their proper owners, but principally, from the security that was created by the representations of Deerslayer.\n\nHe had examined the state of things among the Hurons, and felt satisfied that they meditated no further hostilities during the night, the loss they had met having indisposed them to further exertions for the moment.\n\nThen, he had a proposition to make; the object of his visit; and, if this were accepted, the war would at once terminate between the parties; and it was improbable that the Hurons would anticipate the failure of a project on which their chiefs had apparently set their hearts, by having recourse to violence previously to the return of their messenger. As soon as the Ark was properly secured, the different members of the party occupied themselves in their several peculiar manners, haste in council, or in decision, no more characterizing the proceedings of these border whites, than it did those of their red neighbors.\n\nThe women busied themselves in preparations for the evening meal, sad and silent, but ever attentive to the first wants of nature. Hurry set about repairing his moccasins, by the light of a blazing knot; Chingachgook seated himself in gloomy thought, while Deerslayer proceeded, in a manner equally free from affectation and concern, to examine 'Killdeer', the rifle of Hutter that has been already mentioned, and which subsequently became so celebrated, in the hands of the individual who was now making a survey of its merits.\n\nThe piece was a little longer than usual, and had evidently been turned out from the work shops of some manufacturer of a superior order.\n\nIt had a few silver ornaments, though, on the whole, it would have been deemed a plain piece by most frontier men, its great merit consisting in the accuracy of its bore, the perfection of the details, and the excellence of the metal.\n\nAgain and again did the hunter apply the breech to his shoulder, and glance his eye along the sights, and as often did he poise his body and raise the weapon slowly, as if about to catch an aim at a deer, in order to try the weight, and to ascertain its fitness for quick and accurate firing.\n\nAll this was done, by the aid of Hurry's torch, simply, but with an earnestness and abstraction that would have been found touching by any spectator who happened to know the real situation of the man.\n\n\"'Tis a glorious we'pon, Hurry!\"\n\nDeerslayer at length exclaimed,\n\n\"and it may be thought a pity that it has fallen into the hands of women. The hunters have told me of its expl'ites, and by all I have heard, I should set it down as sartain death in exper'enced hands. Hearken to the tick of this lock\u2014a wolf trap has'n't a livelier spring; pan and cock speak together, like two singing masters undertaking a psalm in meetin'. I never did see so true a bore, Hurry, that's sartain!\"\n\n\"Ay, Old Tom used to give the piece a character, though he wasn't the man to particularize the ra'al natur' of any sort of fire arms, in practise,\"\nreturned March, passing the deer's thongs through the moccasin with the coolness of a cobbler.\n\n\"He was no marksman, that we must all allow; but he had his good p'ints, as well as his bad ones. I have had hopes that Judith might consait the idee of giving Killdeer to me.\"\n\n\"There's no saying what young women may do, that's a truth, Hurry, and I suppose you're as likely to own the rifle as another. Still, when things are so very near perfection, it's a pity not to reach it entirely.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\u2014Would not that piece look as well on my shoulder, as on any man's?\"\n\n\"As for looks, I say nothing. You are both good-looking, and might make what is called a good-looking couple.\nBut the true p'int is as to conduct. More deer would fall in one day, by that piece, in some man's hands, than would fall in a week in your'n, Hurry! I've seen you try; yes, remember the buck t'other day.\"\n\n\"That buck was out of season, and who wishes to kill venison out of season. I was merely trying to frighten the creatur', and I think you will own that he was pretty well skeared, at any rate.\"\n\n\"Well, well, have it as you say. But this is a lordly piece, and would make a steady hand and quick eye the King of the Woods!\"\n\n\"Then keep it, Deerslayer, and become King of the Woods,\"\n\nsaid Judith, earnestly, who had heard the conversation, and whose eye was never long averted from the honest countenance of the hunter. \"It can never be in better hands than it is, at this moment, and there I hope it will remain these fifty years.\n\n\"Judith you can't be in 'arnest!\"\n\nexclaimed Deerslayer, taken so much by surprise, as to betray more emotion than it was usual for him to manifest on ordinary occasions. \"Such a gift would be fit for a ra'al King to make; yes, and for a ra'al King to receive.\"\n\n\"I never was more in earnest, in my life, Deerslayer, and I am as much in earnest in the wish as in the gift.\"\n\n\"Well, gal, well; we'll find time to talk of this ag'in. You mustn't be down hearted, Hurry, for Judith is a sprightly young woman, and she has a quick reason; she knows that the credit of her father's rifle is safer in my hands, than it can possibly be in yourn; and, therefore, you mustn't be down hearted. In other matters, more to your liking, too, you'll find she'll give you the preference.\"\nHurry growled out his dissatisfaction, but he was too intent on quitting the lake, and in making his preparations, to waste his breath on a subject of this nature. Shortly after, the supper was ready, and it was eaten in silence as is so much the habit of those who consider the table as merely a place of animal refreshment.\n\nOn this occasion, however, sadness and thought contributed their share to the general desire not to converse, for Deerslayer was so far an exception to the usages of men of his cast, as not only to wish to hold discourse on such occasions, but as often to create a similar desire in his companions.\n\nThe meal ended, and the humble preparations removed, the whole party assembled on the platform to hear the expected intelligence from Deerslayer on the subject of his visit.\n\nIt had been evident he was in no haste to make his communication, but the feelings of Judith would no longer admit of delay. Stools were brought from the Ark and the hut, and the whole six placed themselves in a circle, near the door, watching each other's countenances, as best they could, by the scanty means that were furnished by a lovely star-light night. Along the shores, beneath the mountains, lay the usual body of gloom, but in the broad lake no shadow was cast, and a thousand mimic stars were dancing in the limpid element, that was just stirred enough by the evening air to set them all in motion.\n\n\"Now, Deerslayer,\"\n\ncommenced Judith, whose impatience resisted further restraint\u2014\n\n\"now, Deerslayer, tell us all the Hurons have to say, and the reason why they have sent you on parole, to make us some offer.\"\n\n\"Furlough, Judith; furlough is the word; and it carries the same meaning with a captyve at large, as it does with a soldier who has leave to quit his colors. In both cases the word is passed to come back, and now I remember to have heard that's the ra'al signification; 'furlough' meaning a 'word' passed for the doing of any thing of the like. Parole I rather think is Dutch, and has something to do with the tattoos of the garrisons. But this makes no great difference, since the vartue of a pledge lies in the idee, and not in the word. Well, then, if the message must be given, it must; and perhaps there is no use in putting it off. Hurry will soon be wanting to set out on his journey to the river, and the stars rise and set, just as if they cared for neither Injin nor message. Ah's! me; 'Tisn't a pleasant, and I know it's a useless ar'n'd, but it must be told.\"\n\n\"Harkee, Deerslayer,\"\n\nput in Hurry, a little authoritatively\u2014\n\n\"You're a sensible man in a hunt, and as good a fellow on a march, as a sixty-miler-a-day could wish to meet with, but you're oncommon slow about messages; especially them that you think won't be likely to be well received. When a thing is to be told, why tell it; and don't hang back like a Yankee lawyer pretending he can't understand a Dutchman's English, just to get a double fee out of him.\"\n\n\"I understand you, Hurry, and well are you named to-night, seeing you've no time to lose. But let us come at once to the p'int, seeing that's the object of this council\u2014for council it may be called, though women have seats among us. The simple fact is this. When the party came back from the castle, the Mingos held a council, and bitter thoughts were uppermost, as was plain to be seen by their gloomy faces. No one likes to be beaten, and a red-skin as little as a pale-face. Well, when they had smoked upon it, and made their speeches, and their council fire had burnt low, the matter came out. It seems the elders among 'em consaited I was a man to be trusted on a furlough\u2014They're wonderful obsarvant, them Mingos; that their worst mimics must allow\u2014but they consaited I was such a man; and it isn't often\u2014\" added the hunter, with a pleasing consciousness that his previous life justified this implicit reliance on his good faith\u2014\"it isn't often they consait any thing so good of a pale-face; but so they did with me, and, therefore, they didn't hesitate to speak their minds, which is just this: You see the state of things. The lake, and all on it, they fancy, lie at their marcy. Thomas Hutter is deceased, and, as for Hurry, they've got the idee he has been near enough to death to-day, not to wish to take another look at him this summer. Therefore, they account all your forces as reduced to Chingachgook and the two young women, and, while they know the Delaware to be of a high race, and a born warrior, they know he's now on his first war path. As for the gals, of course they set them down much as they do women in gin'ral.\"\n\n\"You mean that they despise us!\"\n\ninterrupted Judith, with eyes that flashed so brightly as to be observed by all present.\n\n\"That will be seen in the end. They hold that all on the lake lies at their marcy, and, therefore, they send by me this belt of wampum,\"\n\nshowing the article in question to the Delaware, as he spoke,\n\n\"with these words. 'Tell the Sarpent, they say, that he has done well for a beginner; he may now strike across the mountains for his own villages, and no one shall look for his trail. If he has found a scalp, let him take it with him, for the Huron braves have hearts, and can feel for a young warrior who doesn't wish to go home empty-handed. If he is nimble, he is welcome to lead out a party in pursuit. Hist, howsever, must go back to the Hurons, for, when she left there in the night, she carried away by mistake, that which doesn't belong to her.\"\n\n\"That can't be true!\" said Hetty earnestly. \"Hist is no such girl, but one that gives every body his due\u2014\"\n\nHow much more she would have said in remonstrance cannot be known, inasmuch as Hist, partly laughing and partly hiding her face in shame, passed her own hand across the speaker's mouth in a way to check the words.\n\n\"You don't understand Mingo messages, poor Hetty\u2014\" resumed Deerslayer, \"which seldom mean what lies exactly uppermost. Hist has brought away with her the inclinations of a young Huron, and they want her back again, that the poor young man may find them where he last saw them! The Sarpent they say is too promising a young warrior not to find as many wives as he wants, but this one he cannot have. That's their meaning, and nothing else, as I understand it.\"\n\n\"They are very obliging and thoughtful, in supposing a young woman can forget all her own inclinations in order to let this unhappy youth find his!\" said Judith, ironically; though her manner became more bitter as she proceeded. \"I suppose a woman is a woman, let her colour be white, or red, and your chiefs know little of a woman's heart, Deerslayer, if they think it can ever forgive when wronged, or ever forget when it fairly loves.\"\n\n\"I suppose that's pretty much the truth with some women, Judith, though I've known them that could do both. The next message is to you. They say the Muskrat, as they called your father, has dove to the bottom of the lake; that he will never come up again, and that his young will soon be in want of wigwams if not of food. The Huron huts, they think, are better than the huts of York, and they wish you to come and try them. Your colour is white, they own, but they think young women who've lived so long in the woods would lose their way in the clearin's. A great warrior among them has lately lost his wife, and he would be glad to put the Wild Rose on her bench at his fireside. As for the Feeble Mind, she will always be honored and taken care of by red warriors. Your father's goods they think ought to go to enrich the tribe, but your own property, which is to include everything of a female natur', will go like that of all wives, into the wigwam of the husband. Moreover, they've lost a young maiden by violence, lately, and 'twill take two pale-faces to fill her seat.\"\n\"And do you bring such a message to me,\" exclaimed Judith, though the tone in which the words were uttered had more in it of sorrow than of anger. \"Am I a girl to be an Indian's slave?\"\n\n\"If you wish my honest thoughts on this p'int, Judith, I shall answer that I don't think you'll, willingly, ever become any man's slave; red-skin or white. You're not to think hard, howsever, of my bringing the message, as near as I could, in the very words in which it was given to me. Them was the conditions on which I got my furlough, and a bargain is a bargain, though it is made with a vagabond. I've told you what they've said, but I've not yet told you what I think you ought, one and all, to answer.\"\n\"Ay; let's hear that, Deerslayer,\" put in Hurry. \"My cur'osity is up on that consideration, and I should like, right well, to hear your idees of the reasonableness of the reply. For my part, though, my own mind is pretty much settled on the p'int of my own answer, which shall be made known as soon as necessary.\"\n\n\"And so is mine, Hurry, on all the different heads, and on no one is it more sartainly settled that on your'n. If I was you, I should say\u2014'Deerslayer, tell them scamps they don't know Harry March! He is human; and having a white skin, he has also a white natur', which natur' won't let him desart females of his own race and gifts in their greatest need. So set me down as one that will refuse to come into your treaty, though you should smoke a hogshead of tobacco over it.'\"\n\nMarch was a little embarrassed at this rebuke, which was uttered with sufficient warmth of manner, and with a point that left no doubt of the meaning. Had Judith encouraged him, he would not have hesitated about remaining to defend her and her sister, but under the circumstances a feeling of resentment rather urged him to abandon them. At all events, there was not a sufficiency of chivalry in Hurry Harry to induce him to hazard the safety of his own person unless he could see a direct connection between the probable consequences and his own interests. It is no wonder, therefore, that his answer partook equally of his intention, and of the reliance he so boastingly placed on his gigantic strength, which if it did not always make him outrageous, usually made him impudent, as respects those with whom he conversed.\n\n\"Fair words make long friendships, Master Deerslayer,\"\n\nhe said a little menacingly.\n\n\"You're but a stripling, and you know by exper'ence what you are in the hands of a man. As you're not me, but only a go between sent by the savages to us Christians, you may tell your empl'yers that they do know Harry March, which is a proof of their sense as well as his. He's human enough to follow human natur', and that tells him to see the folly of one man's fighting a whole tribe. If females desart him, they must expect to be desarted by him, whether they're of his own gifts or another man's gifts. Should Judith see fit to change her mind, she's welcome to my company to the river, and Hetty with her; but shouldn't she come to this conclusion, I start as soon as I think the enemy's scouts are beginning to nestle themselves in among the brush and leaves for the night.\"\n\n\"Judith will not change her mind, and she does not ask your company, Master March,\"\n\nreturned the girl with spirit.\n\n\"That p'int's settled, then,\" resumed Deerslayer, unmoved by the other's warmth. \"Hurry Harry must act for himself, and do that which will be most likely to suit his own fancy. The course he means to take will give him an easy race, if it don't give him an easy conscience. Next comes the question with Hist\u2014what say you gal?\u2014Will you desart your duty, too, and go back to the Mingos and take a Huron husband, and all not for the love of the man you're to marry, but for the love of your own scalp?\"\n\n\"Why you talk so to Hist!\"\n\ndemanded the girl half-offended.\n\"You t'ink a red-skin girl made like captain's lady, to laugh and joke with any officer that come.\"\n\n\"What I think, Hist, is neither here nor there in this matter. I must carry back your answer, and in order to do so it is necessary that you should send it. A faithful messenger gives his ar'n'd, word for word.\"\n\nHist no longer hesitated to speak her mind fully. In the excitement she rose from her bench, and naturally recurring to that language in which she expressed herself the most readily, she delivered her thoughts and intentions, beautifully and with dignity, in the tongue of her own people.\n\n\"Tell the Hurons, Deerslayer,\" she said, \"that they are as ignorant as moles; they don't know the wolf from the dog. Among my people, the rose dies on the stem where it budded, the tears of the child fall on the graves of its parents; the corn grows where the seed has been planted. The Delaware girls are not messengers to be sent, like belts of wampum, from tribe to tribe. They are honeysuckles, that are sweetest in their own woods; their own young men carry them away in their bosoms, because they are fragrant; they are sweetest when plucked from their native stems. Even the robin and the martin come back, year after year, to their old nests; shall a woman be less true hearted than a bird? Set the pine in the clay and it will turn yellow; the willow will not flourish on the hill; the tamarack is healthiest in the swamp; the tribes of the sea love best to hear the winds that blow over the salt water. As for a Huron youth, what is he to a maiden of the Lenni Lenape. He may be fleet, but her eyes do not follow him in the race; they look back towards the lodges of the Delawares. He may sing a sweet song for the girls of Canada, but there is no music for Wah, but in the tongue she has listened to from childhood. Were the Huron born of the people that once owned the shores of the salt lake, it would be in vain, unless he were of the family of Uncas. The young pine will rise to be as high as any of its fathers. Wah-ta-Wah has but one heart, and it can love but one husband.\"\n\nDeerslayer listened to this characteristic message, which was given with an earnestness suited to the feelings from which it sprung, with undisguised delight, meeting the ardent eloquence of the girl, as she concluded, with one of his own heartfelt, silent, and peculiar fits of laughter.\n\n\"That's worth all the wampum in the woods!\" he exclaimed. \"You don't understand it, I suppose, Judith, but if you'll look into your feelin's, and fancy that an inimy had sent to tell you to give up the man of your ch'ice, and to take up with another that wasn't the man of your ch'ice, you'll get the substance of it, I'll warrant! Give me a woman for ra'al eloquence, if they'll only make up their minds to speak what they feel. By speakin', I don't mean chatterin', howsever; for most of them will do that by the hour; but comm' out with their honest, deepest feelin's in proper words. And now, Judith, having got the answer of a red-skin girl, it is fit I should get that of a pale-face, if, indeed, a countenance that is as blooming as your'n can in any wise so be tarmed. You are well named the Wild Rose, and so far as colour goes, Hetty ought to be called the Honeysuckle.\"\n\n\"Did this language come from one of the garrison gallants, I should deride it, Deerslayer, but coming from you, I know it can be depended on,\" returned Judith, deeply gratified by his unmeditated and characteristic compliments. \"It is too soon, however, to ask my answer; the Great Serpent has not yet spoken.\"\n\n\"The Sarpent! Lord; I could carry back his speech without hearing a word of it! I didn't think of putting the question to him at all, I will allow; though 'twould be hardly right either, seeing that truth is truth, and I'm bound to tell these Mingos the fact and nothing else. So, Chingachgook, let us hear your mind on this matter\u2014are you inclined to strike across the hills towards your village, to give up Hist to a Huron, and to tell the chiefs at home that, if they're actyve and successful, they may possibly get on the end of the Iroquois trail some two or three days a'ter the inimy has got off of it?\"\n\nLike his betrothed, the young chief arose, that his answer might be given with due distinctness and dignity. Hist had spoken with her hands crossed upon her bosom, as if to suppress the emotions within, but the warrior stretched an arm before him with a calm energy that aided in giving emphasis to his expressions.\n\n\"Wampum should be sent for wampum,\"\n\nhe said;\n\n\"a message must be answered by a message. Hear what the Great Serpent of the Delawares has to say to the pretended wolves from the great lakes, that are howling through our woods. They are no wolves; they are dogs that have come to get their tails and ears cropped by the hands of the Delawares. They are good at stealing young women; bad at keeping them. Chingachgook takes his own where he finds it; he asks leave of no cur from the Canadas. If he has a tender feeling in his heart, it is no business of the Hurons. He tells it to her who most likes to know it; he will not bellow it in the forest, for the ears of those that only understand yells of terror. What passes in his lodge is not for the chiefs of his own people to know; still less for Mingo rogues\u2014\"\n\n\"Call 'em vagabonds, Sarpent\u2014\" interrupted Deerslayer, unable to restrain his delight\u2014\"yes, just call 'em up-and-down vagabonds, which is a word easily intarpreted, and the most hateful of all to their ears, it's so true. Never fear me; I'll give em your message, syllable for syllable, sneer for sneer, idee for idee, scorn for scorn, and they desarve no better at your hands\u2014only call 'em vagabonds, once or twice, and that will set the sap mounting in 'em, from their lowest roots to the uppermost branches!\"\n\n\"Still less for Mingo vagabonds,\" resumed Chingachgook, quite willingly complying with his friend's request. \"Tell the Huron dogs to howl louder, if they wish a Delaware to find them in the woods, where they burrow like foxes, instead of hunting like warriors. When they had a Delaware maiden in their camp, there was a reason for hunting them up; now they will be forgotten unless they make a noise. Chingachgook don't like the trouble of going to his villages for more warriors; he can strike their run-a-way trail; unless they hide it under ground, he will follow it to Canada alone. He will keep Wah-ta-Wah with him to cook his game; they two will be Delawares enough to scare all the Hurons back to their own country.\"\n\n\"That's a grand despatch, as the officers call them things!\" cried Deerslayer; \"'twill set all the Huron blood in motion; most particularily that part where he tells 'em Hist, too, will keep on their heels 'til they're fairly driven out of the country. Ahs! me; big words ain't always big deeds, notwithstanding! The Lord send that we be able to be only one half as good as we promise to be! And now, Judith, it's your turn to speak, for them miscreants will expect an answer from each person, poor Hetty, perhaps, excepted.\"\n\"And why not Hetty, Deerslayer? She often speaks to the purpose; the Indians may respect her words, for they feel for people in her condition.\"\n\n\"That is true, Judith, and quick-thoughted in you. The red-skins do respect misfortunes of all kinds, and Hetty's in particular. So, Hetty, if you have any thing to say, I'll carry it to the Hurons as faithfully as if it was spoken by a schoolmaster, or a missionary.\"\n\nThe girl hesitated a moment, and then she answered in her own gentle, soft tones, as earnestly as any who had preceded her.\n\n\"The Hurons can't understand the difference between white people and themselves,\"\n\nshe said,\n\n\"or they wouldn't ask Judith and me to go and live in their villages. God has given one country to the red men and another to us. He meant us to live apart. Then mother always said that we should never dwell with any but Christians, if possible, and that is a reason why we can't go. This lake is ours, and we won't leave it. Father and mother's graves are in it, and even the worst Indians love to stay near the graves of their fathers. I will come and see them again, if they wish me to, and read more out of the Bible to them, but I can't quit father's and mother's graves.\"\n\n\"That will do\u2014that will do, Hetty, just as well as if you sent them a message twice as long,\" interrupted the hunter. \"I'll tell 'em all you've said, and all you mean, and I'll answer for it that they'll be easily satisfied. Now, Judith, your turn comes next, and then this part of my ar'n'd will be tarminated for the night.\"\n\nJudith manifested a reluctance to give her reply, that had awakened a little curiosity in the messenger. Judging from her known spirit, he had never supposed the girl would be less true her feelings and principles than Hist, or Hetty, and yet there was a visible wavering of purpose that rendered him slightly uneasy. Even now when directly required to speak, she seemed to hesitate, nor did she open her lips until the profound silence told her how anxiously her words were expected. Then, indeed, she spoke, but it was doubtingly and with reluctance.\n\n\"Tell me, first\u2014tell us, first, Deerslayer,\" she commenced, repeating the words merely to change the emphasis\u2014\"what effect will our answers have on your fate? If you are to be the sacrifice of our spirit, it would have been better had we all been more wary as to the language we use. What, then, are likely to be the consequences to yourself?\"\n\n\"Lord, Judith, you might as well ask me which way the wind will blow next week, or what will be the age of the next deer that will be shot! I can only say that their faces look a little dark upon me, but it doesn't thunder every time a black cloud rises, nor does every puff of wind blow up rain. That's a question, therefore, much more easily put than answered.\"\n\n\"So is this message of the Iroquois to me,\"\n\nanswered Judith rising, as if she had determined on her own course for the present.\n\n\"My answer shall be given, Deerslayer, after you and I have talked together alone, when the others have laid themselves down for the night.\"\n\nThere was a decision in the manner of the girl that disposed Deerslayer to comply, and this he did the more readily as the delay could produce no material consequences one way or the other. The meeting now broke up, Hurry announcing his resolution to leave them speedily. During the hour that was suffered to intervene, in order that the darkness might deepen before the frontierman took his departure, the different individuals occupied themselves in their customary modes, the hunter, in particular, passing most of the time in making further enquiries into the perfection of the rifle already mentioned.\n\nThe hour of nine soon arrived, however, and then it had been determined that Hurry should commence his journey. Instead of making his adieus frankly, and in a generous spirit, the little he thought it necessary to say was uttered sullenly and in coldness. Resentment at what he considered Judith's obstinacy was blended with mortification at the career he had since reaching the lake, and, as is usual with the vulgar and narrow-minded, he was more disposed to reproach others with his failures than to censure himself.\n\nJudith gave him her hand, but it was quite as much in gladness as with regret, while the two Delawares were not sorry to find he was leaving them. Of the whole party, Hetty alone betrayed any real feeling. Bashfulness, and the timidity of her sex and character, kept even her aloof, so that Hurry entered the canoe, where Deerslayer was already waiting for him, before she ventured near enough to be observed. Then, indeed, the girl came into the Ark and approached its end, just as the little bark was turning from it, with a movement so light and steady as to be almost imperceptible.\n\nAn impulse of feeling now overcame her timidity, and Hetty spoke.\n\n\"Goodbye Hurry\u2014\"\n\nshe called out,\n\nin her sweet voice\u2014\n\n\"goodbye, dear Hurry.\nTake care of yourself in the woods, and don't stop once, 'til you reach the garrison. The leaves on the trees are scarcely plentier than the Hurons round the lake, and they'll not treat a strong man like you as kindly as they treat me.\"\n\nThe ascendency which March had obtained over this feebleminded, but right-thinking, and right-feeling girl, arose from a law of nature.\n\nHer senses had been captivated by his personal advantages, and her moral communications with him had never been sufficiently intimate to counteract an effect that must have been otherwise lessened, even with one whose mind was as obtuse as her own.\n\nHetty's instinct of right, if such a term can be applied to one who seemed taught by some kind spirit how to steer her course with unerring accuracy, between good and evil, would have revolted at Hurry's character on a thousand points, had there been opportunities to enlighten her, but while he conversed and trifled with her sister, at a distance from herself, his perfection of form and feature had been left to produce their influence on her simple imagination and naturally tender feelings, without suffering by the alloy of his opinions and coarseness.\n\nIt is true she found him rough and rude; but her father was that, and most of the other men she had seen, and that which she believed to belong to all of the sex struck her less unfavorably in Hurry's character than it might otherwise have done. Still, it was not absolutely love that Hetty felt for Hurry, nor do we wish so to portray it, but merely that awakening sensibility and admiration, which, under more propitious circumstances, and always supposing no untoward revelations of character on the part of the young man had supervened to prevent it, might soon have ripened into that engrossing feeling.\n\nShe felt for him an incipient tenderness, but scarcely any passion.\n\nPerhaps the nearest approach to the latter that Hetty had manifested was to be seen in the sensitiveness which had caused her to detect March's predilection for her sister, for, among Judith's many admirers, this was the only instance in which the dull mind of the girl had been quickened into an observation of the circumstances.\n\nHurry received so little sympathy at his departure that the gentle tones of Hetty, as she thus called after him, sounded soothingly.\n\nHe checked the canoe, and with one sweep of his powerful arm brought it back to the side of the Ark. This was more than Hetty, whose courage had risen with the departure of her hero, expected, and she now shrunk timidly back at this unexpected return.\n\n\"You're a good gal, Hetty, and I can't quit you without shaking hands,\"\n\nsaid March kindly.\n\n\"Judith, a'ter all, isn't worth as much as you, though she may be a trifle better looking. As to wits, if honesty and fair dealing with a young man is a sign of sense in a young woman, you're worth a dozen Judiths; ay, and for that matter, most young women of my acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Don't say any thing against Judith, Harry,\"\n\nreturned Hetty imploringly.\n\n\"Father's gone, and mother's gone, and nobody's left but Judith and me, and it isn't right for sisters to speak evil, or to hear evil of each other. Father's in the lake, and so is mother, and we should all fear God, for we don't know when we may be in the lake, too.\"\n\n\"That sounds reasonable, child, as does most you say. Well, if we ever meet ag'in, Hetty, you'll find a fri'nd in me, let your sister do what she may. I was no great fri'nd of your mother I'll allow, for we didn't think alike on most p'ints, but then your father, Old Tom, and I, fitted each other as remarkably as a buckskin garment will fit any reasonable-built man. I've always been unanimous of opinion that Old Floating Tom Hutter, at the bottom, was a good fellow, and will maintain that ag'in all inimies for his sake, as well as for your'n.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, Hurry,\"\n\nsaid Hetty, who now wanted to hasten the young man off, as ardently as she had wished to keep him only the moment before, though she could give no clearer account of the latter than of the former feeling; \"goodbye, Hurry; take care of yourself in the woods; don't halt 'til you reach the garrison. I'll read a chapter in the Bible for you before I go to bed, and think of you in my prayers.\"\n\nThis was touching a point on which March had no sympathies, and without more words, he shook the girl cordially by the hand and re-entered the canoe. In another minute the two adventurers were a hundred feet from the Ark, and half a dozen had not elapsed before they were completely lost to view. Hetty sighed deeply, and rejoined her sister and Hist.\n\nFor some time Deerslayer and his companion paddled ahead in silence.\n\nIt had been determined to land Hurry at the precise point where he is represented, in the commencement of our tale, as having embarked, not only as a place little likely to be watched by the Hurons, but because he was sufficiently familiar with the signs of the woods, at that spot, to thread his way through them in the dark. Thither, then, the light craft proceeded, being urged as diligently and as swiftly as two vigorous and skilful canoemen could force their little vessel through, or rather over, the water. Less than a quarter of an hour sufficed for the object, and, at the end of that time, being within the shadows of the shore, and quite near the point they sought, each ceased his efforts in order to make their parting communications out of earshot of any straggler who might happen to be in the neighborhood.\n\n\"You will do well to persuade the officers at the garrison to lead out a party ag'in these vagabonds as soon as you git in, Hurry,\"\n\nDeerslayer commenced;\n\n\"and you'll do better if you volunteer to guide it up yourself. You know the paths, and the shape of the lake, and the natur' of the land, and can do it better than a common, gin'ralizing scout. Strike at the Huron camp first, and follow the signs that will then show themselves. A few looks at the hut and the Ark will satisfy you as to the state of the Delaware and the women, and, at any rate, there'll be a fine opportunity to fall on the Mingo trail, and to make a mark on the memories of the blackguards that they'll be apt to carry with 'em a long time. It won't be likely to make much difference with me, since that matter will be detarmined afore to-morrow's sun has set, but it may make a great change in Judith and Hetty's hopes and prospects!\"\n\n\"And as for yourself, Nathaniel,\" Hurry enquired with more interest than he was accustomed to betray in the welfare of others\u2014\"And, as for yourself, what do you think is likely to turn up?\"\n\n\"The Lord, in his wisdom, only can tell, Henry March! The clouds look black and threatening, and I keep my mind in a state to meet the worst. Vengeful feelin's are uppermost in the hearts of the Mingos, and any little disapp'intment about the plunder, or the prisoners, or Hist, may make the torments sartain. The Lord, in his wisdom, can only detarmine my fate, or your'n!\"\n\n\"This is a black business, and ought to be put a stop to in some way or other\u2014\" answered Hurry, confounding the distinctions between right and wrong, as is usual with selfish and vulgar men. \"I heartily wish old Hutter and I had scalped every creatur' in their camp, the night we first landed with that capital object! Had you not held back, Deerslayer, it might have been done, and then you wouldn't have found yourself, at the last moment, in the desperate condition you mention.\"\n\n\"'Twould have been better had you said you wished you had never attempted to do what it little becomes any white man's gifts to undertake; in which case, not only might we have kept from coming to blows, but Thomas Hutter would now have been living, and the hearts of the savages would be less given to vengeance. The death of that young woman, too, was on-called for, Henry March, and leaves a heavy load on our names if not on our consciences!\"\n\nThis was so apparent, and it seemed so obvious to Hurry himself, at the moment, that he dashed his paddle into the water, and began to urge the canoe towards the shore, as if bent only on running away from his own lively remorse. His companion humoured this feverish desire for change, and, in a minute or two, the bows of the boat grated lightly on the shingle of the beach. To land, shoulder his pack and rifle, and to get ready for his march occupied Hurry but an instant, and with a growling adieu, he had already commenced his march, when a sudden twinge of feeling brought him to a dead stop, and immediately after to the other's side.\n\n\"You cannot mean to give yourself up ag'in to them murdering savages, Deerslayer!\" he said, quite as much in angry remonstrance, as with generous feeling. \"'Twould be the act of a madman or a fool!\"\n\n\"There's them that thinks it madness to keep their words, and there's them that don't, Hurry Harry. You may be one of the first, but I'm one of the last. No red-skin breathing shall have it in his power to say that a Mingo minds his word more than a man of white blood and white gifts, in any thing that consarns me. I'm out on a furlough, and if I've strength and reason, I'll go in on a furlough afore noon to-morrow!\"\n\n\"What's an Injin, or a word passed, or a furlough taken from creatur's like them, that have neither souls, nor reason!\"\n\n\"If they've got neither souls nor reason, you and I have both, Henry March, and one is accountable for the other. This furlough is not, as you seem to think, a matter altogether atween me and the Mingos, seeing it is a solemn bargain made atween me and God. He who thinks that he can say what he pleases, in his distress, and that twill all pass for nothing, because 'tis uttered in the forest, and into red men's ears, knows little of his situation, and hopes, and wants. The woods are but the ears of the Almighty, the air is his breath, and the light of the sun is little more than a glance of his eye. Farewell, Harry; we may not meet ag'in, but I would wish you never to treat a furlough, or any other solemn thing that your Christian God has been called on to witness, as a duty so light that it may be forgotten according to the wants of the body, or even accordin' to the cravings of the spirit.\"\n\nMarch was now glad again to escape. It was quite impossible that he could enter into the sentiments that ennobled his companion, and he broke away from both with an impatience that caused him secretly to curse the folly that could induce a man to rush, as it were, on his own destruction.\n\nDeerslayer, on the contrary, manifested no such excitement.\n\nSustained by his principles, inflexible in the purpose of acting up to them, and superior to any unmanly apprehension, he regarded all before him as a matter of course, and no more thought of making any unworthy attempt to avoid it, than a Mussulman thinks of counteracting the decrees of Providence.\n\nHe stood calmly on the shore, listening to the reckless tread with which Hurry betrayed his progress through the bushes, shook his head in dissatisfaction at the want of caution, and then stepped quietly into his canoe. Before he dropped the paddle again into the water, the young man gazed about him at the scene presented by the star-lit night. This was the spot where he had first laid his eyes on the beautiful sheet of water on which he floated.\n\nIf it was then glorious in the bright light of a summer's noon-tide, it was now sad and melancholy under the shadows of night. The mountains rose around it like black barriers to exclude the outer world, and the gleams of pale light that rested on the broader parts of the basin were no bad symbols of the faintness of the hopes that were so dimly visible in his own future. Sighing heavily, he pushed the canoe from the land, and took his way back with steady diligence towards the Ark and the castle.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/912337", "artist_names": "Seinfeld", "full_title": "The Soul Mate Script by\u00a0Seinfeld", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c8dcfb2f8ac56411c6f87c39162861f7.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c8dcfb2f8ac56411c6f87c39162861f7.536x536x1.jpg", "id": 912337, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 347370, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429484580, "path": "/Seinfeld-the-soul-mate-script-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Seinfeld-the-soul-mate-script-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1996, "month": 9, "day": 26}, "release_date_for_display": "September 26, 1996", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Sep. 26, 1996", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c8dcfb2f8ac56411c6f87c39162861f7.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c8dcfb2f8ac56411c6f87c39162861f7.536x536x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "The Soul Mate Script", "title_with_featured": "The Soul Mate Script", "updated_by_human_at": 1668553138, "url": "https://genius.com/Seinfeld-the-soul-mate-script-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/44464", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/57gy524wz7v6c2vmjljgkujmv.800x600x1.jpg", "id": 44464, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/57gy524wz7v6c2vmjljgkujmv.800x600x1.jpg", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Seinfeld", "slug": "Seinfeld", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Seinfeld"}, "artist": "Seinfeld", "lyrics": "The Soul Mate Script LyricsGEORGE AT A MEETING AT THE SUSAN ROSS FOUNDATION.\n\nGEORGE: You want me to find a poem about Susan?

(Touches Kramer's hand) It was really nice meeting you.\n\nJerry and Pam leave. Kramer sniffs his hand where Pam touched him, and makes a delighted noise.\nKRAMER AND NEWMAN IN NEWMAN'S APARTMENT.\n\nKRAMER: I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.\n\nNEWMAN: Go on.\n\nKRAMER: Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.\n\nNEWMAN: Ah, yes. Forbidden love.\n\nKRAMER: She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.\n\nNEWMAN: \"Pam.\" I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.\n\nKRAMER: I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)\n\nNEWMAN: Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)\n\nKRAMER: She has delicate beauty.\n\nNEWMAN: Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.\n\nKRAMER: And yet, he's my friend.\n\nNEWMAN: And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.\n\nKRAMER: Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.\n\nNEWMAN: One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.\n\nKRAMER: I thought we were talking about me.\n\nNEWMAN: Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.\n\nKRAMER: Confront Jerry? I can't.\n\nNEWMAN: You must!\n\nKRAMER: I won't!\n\nNEWMAN: You will!\n\nJERRY, ELAINE AND GEORGE AT A NEWSSTAND.\n\nELAINE (to Jerry, imitating Carol): \"Elaine, ya gotta have a baby.\" Ugh.\n\nGEORGE: Where are all the poetry magazines?\n\nELAINE: The New Yorker has poetry.\n\nGEORGE: Yes. The New Yorker.\n\nJERRY: Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?\n\nELAINE: They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.\n\nJERRY: C'mon, you want to have a baby.\n\nELAINE: Why? Because I can?\n\nJERRY: It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?\n\nELAINE: Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!\n\nKEVIN: I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.\n\nELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry.\n\nKEVIN: No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.\n\nELAINE: Yeah, like you must procreate.\n\nKEVIN: Besides, anyone can do it.\n\nELAINE: Oh, it's been done to death. (smiles)\n\nGEORGE IN ANOTHER MEETING AT THE FOUNDATION. HE HAS A BRIEFCASE WITH A TAPE RECORDER IN IT.\n\nGEORGE: I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.\n\nWYCK: Are you okay, George?\n\nGEORGE: No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)\n\nGeorge is shown standing on the street while the tape rolls inside the briefcase.\n\nCut back to the Foundation meeting.\n\nWYCK: ...and the stock options for this year look quite, uh... (George returns and retrieves the briefcase.)\n\nGEORGE (apologetic): Briefcase. (Shrugs and exits.)\n\nELAINE AND KEVIN AT THE COFFEE SHOP.\n\nELAINE: So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?\n\nKEVIN: Not at all.\n\nELAINE: 'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...\n\nKRAMER (wipes chocolate off his face): Oh, I just had two double-fudge sundaes.\n\nELAINE: Oh. Are you alright?\n\nKRAMER: Yeah, I'll be okay.\n\nELAINE: You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.\n\nKRAMER: Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.\n\nELAINE: Oh, no...that won't last.\n\nKRAMER: What do you mean?\n\nELAINE: He's not ga-ga.\n\nKramer suddenly looks elated and runs out.\nGEORGE SHOWS UP AT JERRY'S APARTMENT LATER THAT NIGHT WITH THE BRIEFCASE.\n\nGEORGE: Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.\n\nJERRY: How long did you leave it up there?\n\nGEORGE: Five minutes. What the hell happened here?\n\nJERRY: Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.\n\nGEORGE: I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.\n\nGeorge plays back the tape. We hear a voice ask, \"Did anyone notice George's fingernails?\" Then a female voice answering, \"Oh my, yes. They looked like they were eaten away by weavels.\" The male voice remarks, \"It's warm in here. Open a window.\" Then, \"Hey! What are you doing?\" The female voice exclaims, \"Dear God.\" There's a clunking sound on the tape, and the recording ends.\n\nJERRY: Is that it?\n\nGEORGE: Stopped dead.\n\nJERRY: What do you make of it?\n\nGEORGE: I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)\n\nKRAMER: Jerry. Uh, can we talk?\n\nGEORGE (to Kramer): Kinda busy here.\n\nKRAMER: I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.\n\nGEORGE: Why can't I stay?\n\nKRAMER: Because it doesn't concern you.\n\nGEORGE: Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)\n\nJERRY: So, what's on your mind?\n\nKRAMER: It's Pam.\n\nJERRY: Pam? What about Pam?\n\nKRAMER: I love her, Jerry!\n\nJERRY: You what?\n\nKRAMER: I love her!\n\nJERRY: Is that right?\n\nKRAMER: Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.\n\nJERRY: What does that mean?\n\nKRAMER: Oh, and that voice!\n\nJERRY: What about her name?\n\nKRAMER: Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!\n\nJERRY: She's got really nice hair.\n\nKRAMER: Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.\n\nJERRY: You've got really specific tastes.\n\nKRAMER: Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.\n\nJERRY: She's got nice calves.\n\nKRAMER: Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...\n\nJERRY: Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.\n\nKRAMER: No you can't, Jerry.\n\nJERRY: But I might.\n\nKRAMER: Oh, no you don't.\n\nJERRY: Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?\n\nKRAMER: What...?\n\nJERRY: I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!\n\nKRAMER (frantic): Huh?\n\nJERRY: Pam!\n\nKRAMER: Huh?\n\nJERRY: Pam!\n\nKRAMER: Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)\n\nKRAMER AND NEWMAN IN NEWMAN'S APARTMENT.\n\nKRAMER: So now he wants her more than ever!\n\nNEWMAN: Blast!\n\nKRAMER: What am I gonna do, huh?\n\nNEWMAN: Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.\n\nKRAMER: What, again with you?\n\nNEWMAN: Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.\n\nKRAMER: If only I could say things like that around her.\n\nNEWMAN (getting an idea): Yes...\n\nELAINE AND GEORGE AT THE COFFEE SHOP LISTENING TO THE BRIEFCASE TAPE.\n\nELAINE: Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...\n\nGEORGE: Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!\n\nELAINE: ...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'\n\nGEORGE: It's baffling, isn't it?\n\nELAINE: Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?\n\nGEORGE: They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)\n\nJERRY: That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!\n\nELAINE: Ga-ga? When did that happen?\n\nJERRY: Yesterday. Six-ish.\n\nELAINE: Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.\n\nJERRY: You just met the guy yesterday.\n\nELAINE: Yeah, but we have a common goal.\n\nJERRY: A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?\n\nELAINE (happily): Yeah.\n\nGEORGE: And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.\n\nELAINE: Yeah, of course.\n\nJERRY: Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.\n\nELAINE: Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.\n\nGEORGE: Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, \"Pardon my French.\"\n\nJERRY: I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.\n\nGEORGE: I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.\n\nKRAMER AND NEWMAN IN AN AISLE AT THE BOOKSTORE WHERE PAM WORKS.\n\nNEWMAN: With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)\n\nPAM: Oh, hi! Kramer.\n\nNEWMAN (whispers through the bookcase): Hi. How are you?\n\nKRAMER: Hi. How are you?\n\nPAM: I'm great.\n\nNEWMAN: I too am well.\n\nKRAMER: I too am well.\n\nNEWMAN: Do I smell Pantene?\n\nKRAMER: Do I smell?\n\nNEWMAN: Pantene!\n\nKRAMER: Uh, Pantene.\n\nPAM: Oh, my shampoo. Yeah, it is Pantene, I got a free sample in with my junk mail.\n\nKRAMER (talks rapidly in an attempt to keep up with Newman): Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...\n\nNEWMAN (frantic): ...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...\n\nKRAMER: Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)\n\nPAM: What?\n\nKRAMER: Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.\n\nPAM: That's so true.\n\nKRAMER: Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...\n\nNEWMAN: Shell.\n\nKRAMER: ...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.\n\nPAM: Kramer, that is so lovely.\n\nKRAMER: It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.\n\nPAM: Oh, what's his name?\n\nKRAMER: Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)\n\nELAINE AND KEVIN IN ELAINE'S APARTMENT.\n\nKEVIN: Elaine, you've changed my life.\n\nELAINE: Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.\n\nKEVIN: I got a vasectomy this morning.\n\nELAINE: Although, I have a hunch you mean it.\n\nJERRY TALKING WITH PAM AT THE BOOKSTORE.\n\nJERRY: I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.\n\nPAM: Oh. Well, that's um...(clears her throat)...nice. (Jerry looks suspicious. Pam turns around and Jerry notices her tortoise clip has been replaced with a velvet scrunchie.)\n\nJERRY's brain: A velvet scrunchie!\n\nJERRY: Kramer!\n\nJERRY APPROACHING HIS APARTMENT DOOR. HE MEETS NEWMAN COMING OUT OF KRAMER'S PLACE.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\nJERRY: Hello, Newman.\n\nNEWMAN: Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?\n\nJERRY: Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)\n\nNEWMAN: Well, ta-ta! (Scampers away.)\n\nJERRY: Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)\n\nJERRY: Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)\n\nNEWMAN (sweating): Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.\n\nJERRY: Why not?\n\nNEWMAN: Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)\n\nJERRY (rolls his eyes): C'mon. (They exit.)\n\nJERRY AND NEWMAN IN NEWMAN'S APARTMENT.\n\nJERRY: I can't believe I'm losing Pam!\n\nNEWMAN: I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.\n\nJERRY: I thought we were talking about me.\n\nNEWMAN: Right.\n\nJERRY: Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)\n\nNEWMAN: Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane \"observations\"?\n\nJERRY: Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?\n\nNEWMAN: Well, there is a little something you can do for me...\n\nJERRY: C'mon, out with it.\n\nNEWMAN: It's about...Elaine.\n\nJERRY: Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...\n\nNEWMAN: You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!\n\nJERRY (shrugs): Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)\n\nCUT BACK TO ELAINE AND KEVIN AT ELAINE'S APARTMENT.\n\nKEVIN: I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.\n\nELAINE: I know, I don't want...(clears her throat)...kids.\n\nKEVIN: What was that?\n\nELAINE: Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.\n\nKEVIN: This is! Oh boy, I always do this.\n\nELAINE: What?\n\nKEVIN: Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.\n\nELAINE: Really?\n\nKEVIN: Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.\n\nELAINE: You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...\n\nKEVIN: Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!\n\nELAINE: Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.\n\nKEVIN: Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.\n\nELAINE: Yeah!\n\nKEVIN: Yeah!\n\nJERRY AND GEORGE IN JERRY'S KITCHEN. GEORGE HAS BROUGHT OVER A MODEL OF THE CONFERENCE ROOM AT THE FOUNDATION.\n\nGEORGE: This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.\n\nJERRY: When did you build this thing?\n\nGEORGE: Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...\n\nJERRY (points at the Power Ranger): Wait, that's you?\n\nGEORGE: Yeah.\n\nJERRY (picks up a yellow M&M toy from the model): I really think the M&M should be you.\n\nGEORGE (grabs the M&M away from Jerry): Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.\n\nJERRY: And?\n\nGEORGE: Okay. That's what we know.\n\nJERRY: But we already knew that.\n\nGEORGE: Well, yeah.\n\nJERRY: Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.\n\nGEORGE: I don't know if you're ready for it.\n\nJERRY: Please.\n\nGEORGE: I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -\n\nJERRY: Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?\n\nVOICE ON SPEAKER: It's Pam.\n\nJERRY: C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'\n\nGEORGE: I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)\n\nPAM: What was that?\n\nJERRY: We were just playin.'\n\nPAM: Listen, I had a long talk with Kramer today...\n\nJERRY: Uh huh...\n\nPAM: Well, the thing is, I uh...I think I have a little crush on him. (Kramer slides in the door on his knees.)\n\nKRAMER: I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!\n\nJERRY (to Pam): This is the man you have a crush on?\n\nPAM: Well, I have feelings for both of you.\n\nKRAMER: How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.\n\nJERRY: Why can't I be a soul mate?\n\nKRAMER: Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?\n\nPAM: Children? Who said anything about children? I don't want to have children.\n\nJerry and Kramer look at each other, puzzled.\nGEORGE BACK AT THE CONFERENCE ROOM AT THE FOUNDATION.\n\nGEORGE: There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.\n\nWYCK: George...\n\nGEORGE: You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out...\"Dear God!\" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.\n\nWYCK: George, Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, contained a running tape recorder?\n\nGEORGE: Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.\n\nJERRY AND NEWMAN IN THE OFFICE OF BERNARD WENDROFF, M.D. - UROLOGIST. ELAINE AND KEVIN ENTER. ELAINE HAS CUT HER HAIR SHORT.\n\nELAINE: What are you guys doing here?\n\nJERRY: We're getting vasectomies.\n\nELAINE: Why?\n\nNEWMAN (to Elaine): I'm doing it for you.\n\nELAINE: What?\n\nJERRY (to Elaine): What'd you do to your hair?\n\nELAINE: I cut it.\n\nJERRY: It's a little short.\n\nKEVIN: Y'think?\n\nJERRY (to Kevin): What are you doing here?\n\nELAINE: Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.\n\nJERRY and NEWMAN: Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)\n\nGEORGE READING THE POEM FOR SUSAN AT THE FOUNDATION.\n\nGEORGE: ...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.\n\nWYCK: Is that a Keats poem?\n\nGEORGE: No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)\n\nWYCK: Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan?\n\nMR. CROSS: Oh, yeah. I just assumed he murdered her.\n\nMS. BAINES: Of course he killed her.\n\nWYCK: So it's not just me, then. Alright! Back to business.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/3406355", "artist_names": "Gerald Haywood", "full_title": "2018 haywoodindahood Listening Log by\u00a0Gerald\u00a0Haywood", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c7442dfc16522281e7aa05bcca8fb812.200x165x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c7442dfc16522281e7aa05bcca8fb812.200x165x1.png", "id": 3406355, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 3541884, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1538871425, "path": "/Gerald-haywood-2018-haywoodindahood-listening-log-annotated", "pyongs_count": 2, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Gerald-haywood-2018-haywoodindahood-listening-log-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2018, "month": 1, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "January 1, 2018", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jan. 1, 2018", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c7442dfc16522281e7aa05bcca8fb812.200x165x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c7442dfc16522281e7aa05bcca8fb812.200x165x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 26353}, "title": "2018 haywoodindahood Listening Log", "title_with_featured": "2018 haywoodindahood Listening Log", "updated_by_human_at": 1667015688, "url": "https://genius.com/Gerald-haywood-2018-haywoodindahood-listening-log-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/1065349", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4184eb1c743b380255c43780ed6ef9f7.398x398x1.jpg", "id": 1065349, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4184eb1c743b380255c43780ed6ef9f7.398x398x1.jpg", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Gerald Haywood", "slug": "Gerald-haywood", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Gerald-haywood", "iq": 99371}, "artist": "Gerald Haywood", "lyrics": "2018 haywoodindahood Listening Log LyricsLast updated: 10/6/2018, 5:16PM MSTOctoberOctober 6Jesse Powell \u2014 Jesse Powell (1996)October 5girl in red \u2014 chapter 1 (2018)\nBlanca \u2014 Shattered (2018)\nLouGotCash (feat.

Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.\n\n(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)\n\nTHE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)\n\nCuckoo\nCuckoo\nCuckoo\n\n\n(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)\n\nTHE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.\n\n(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)\n\n(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)\n\nLONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\n\nFATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.\n\n(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.\n\n(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!\n\nJOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\n\nA MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?\n\nA NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\n\nA FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!\n\nA BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father! Little father!\n\nTHE BABES AND SUCKLINGS\n\nClap clap hands till Poldy comes home,\nCakes in his pocket for Leo alone.\n\n\n(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)\n\n\nBABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.)

(He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!\n\n\nTHE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!\n\n\n(The rams' horns sound for silence.

You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen of stout for the missus.\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.\n\nCROFTON This is indeed a festivity.\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.\n\nALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?\n\nBLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.\n\nO'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.\n\nDAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!\n\nBLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.\n\nLENEHAN What about mixed bathing?\n\n(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)\n\nFATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.\n\nMRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!\n\nMOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!\n\nNOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom.

Down with Bloom!\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.\n\nBROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.\n\nBANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.\n\n(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)\n\nBRINI, PAPAL NUNCIO (In papal zouave's uniform, steel cuirasses as breastplate, armplates, thighplates, legplates, large profane moustaches and brown paper mitre.)

And under Ballybough bridge?\n\nA HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?\n\nBLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.\n\nTHE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!\n\n(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)\n\nTHE ARTANE ORPHANS\n\nYou big, you bog, you dirty dog!\nYou think the ladies love you!\n\n\nTHE PRISON GATE GIRLS\n\nIf you see kay\nTell him he may\nSee you in tea\nTell him from me.\n\n\nHORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.\n\n(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)\n\nMESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.\n\nBLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!\n\n(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)\n\nREUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.\n\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!\n\nBROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.\n\n(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)\n\nTHE CITIZEN Thank heaven!\n\nBLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.\n\n(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)\n\nTHE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.\n\n(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in.

Ahhkkk!\n\nELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.\n\nZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.\n\nFLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.\n\nSTEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.\n\n(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)\n\nTHE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.\n\nLYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.\n\n(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O!

Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls.

And his ark was open.\n\nBELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.\n\nLYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.\n\nZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop!

A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)\n\nTHE CROWD\n\nCard of the races.

The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap!

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word.

The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.\n\n\nZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!\n\n\nFLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.\n\n\nBLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!\n\n\nBELLA Police!\n\n\n(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)\nBELLA (Screams.) After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C.

I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/507562", "artist_names": "Jeffrey Eugenides", "full_title": "The Marriage Plot by\u00a0Jeffrey\u00a0Eugenides", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "id": 507562, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1134351, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1409190326, "path": "/Jeffrey-eugenides-the-marriage-plot-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Jeffrey-eugenides-the-marriage-plot-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "song_art_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false}, "title": "The Marriage Plot", "title_with_featured": "The Marriage Plot", "updated_by_human_at": 1409622863, "url": "https://genius.com/Jeffrey-eugenides-the-marriage-plot-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/222795", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "id": 222795, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Jeffrey Eugenides", "slug": "Jeffrey-eugenides", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Jeffrey-eugenides"}, "artist": "Jeffrey Eugenides", "lyrics": "The Marriage Plot LyricsTo start with, look at all the books. There were her Edith Wharton novels, arranged not by title but date of publication; there was the complete Modern Library set of Henry James, a gift from her father on her twenty-first birthday; there were the dog-eared paperbacks assigned in her college courses, a lot of Dickens, a smidgen of Trollope, along with good helpings of Austen, George Eliot, and the redoubtable Bront\u00eb sisters.\n\nThere were a whole lot of black-and-white New Directions paperbacks, mostly poetry by people like H.D. or Denise Levertov.There were the Colette novels she read on the sly.\n\nThere was the first edition of Couples, belonging to her mother, which Madeleine had surreptitiously dipped into back in sixth grade and which she was using now to provide textual support in her English honors thesis on the marriage plot.\n\nThere was, in short, this mid-size but still portable library representing pretty much everything Madeleine had read in college, a collection of texts, seemingly chosen at random, whose focus slowly narrowed, like a personality test, a sophisticated one you couldn\u2019t trick by anticipating the implications of its questions and finally got so lost in that your only recourse was to answer the simple truth.\n\nAnd then you waited for the result, hoping for \u201cArtistic,\u201d or \u201cPassionate,\u201d thinking you could live with \u201cSensitive,\u201d secretly fearing \u201cNarcissistic\u201d and \u201cDomestic,\u201d but finally being presented with an outcome that cut both ways and made you feel different depending on the day, the hour, or the guy you happened to be dating: \u201cIncurably Romantic.\u201d\n\nThese were the books in the room where Madeleine lay, with a pillow over her head, on the morning of her college graduation. She\u2019d read each and every one, often multiple times, frequently underlining passages, but that was no help to her now.\nMadeleine was trying to ignore the room and everything in it. She was hoping to drift back down into the oblivion where she\u2019d been safely couched for the last three hours.\n\nAny higher level of wakefulness would force her to come to grips with certain disagreeable facts: for instance, the amount and variety of the alcohol she\u2019d imbibed last night, and the fact that she\u2019d gone to sleep with her contacts in.\n\nThinking about such specifics would, in turn, call to mind the reasons she\u2019d drunk so much in the first place, which she definitely didn\u2019t want to do. And so Madeleine adjusted her pillow, blocking out the early morning light, and tried to fall back to sleep.\n\nBut it was useless. Because right then, at the other end of her apartment, the doorbell began to ring.\n\nEarly June, Providence, Rhode Island, the sun up for almost two hours already, lighting up the pale bay and the smokestacks of the Narragansett Electric factory, rising like the sun on the Brown University seal emblazoned on all the pennants and banners draped up over campus, a sun with a sagacious face, representing knowledge.\n\nBut this sun\u2014the one over Providence\u2014was doing the metaphorical sun one better, because the founders of the university, in their Baptist pessimism, had chosen to depict the light of knowledge enshrouded by clouds, indicating that ignorance had not yet been dispelled from the human realm, whereas the actual sun was just now fighting its way through cloud cover, sending down splintered beams of light and giving hope to the squadrons of parents, who\u2019d been soaked and frozen all weekend, that the unseasonable weather might not ruin the day\u2019s festivities.\n\nAll over College Hill, in the geometric gardens of the Georgian mansions, the magnolia-scented front yards of Victorians, along brick sidewalks running past black iron fences like those in a Charles Addams cartoon or a Lovecraft story; outside the art studios at the Rhode Island School of Design, where one painting major, having stayed up all night to work, was blaring Patti Smith; shining off the instruments (tuba and trumpet, respectively) of the two members of the Brown marching band who had arrived early at the meeting point and were nervously looking around, wondering where everyone else was; brightening the cobblestone side streets that led downhill to the polluted river, the sun was shining on every brass doorknob, insect wing, and blade of grass.\n\nAnd, in concert with the suddenly flooding light, like a starting gun for all the activity, the doorbell in Madeleine\u2019s fourth-floor apartment began, clamorously, insistently, to ring.\n\nThe pulse reached her less as a sound than as a sensation, an electric shock shooting up her spine. In one motion Madeleine tore the pillow off her head and sat up in bed. She knew who was ringing the buzzer.\n\nIt was her parents. She\u2019d agreed to meet Alton and Phyllida for breakfast at 7:30. She\u2019d made this plan with them two months ago, in April, and now here they were, at the appointed time, in their eager, dependable way.\n\nThat Alton and Phyllida had driven up from New Jersey to see her graduate, that what they were here to celebrate today wasn\u2019t only her achievement but their own as parents, had nothing wrong or unexpected about it.\n\nThe problem was that Madeleine, for the first time in her life, wanted no part of it. She wasn\u2019t proud of herself. She was in no mood to celebrate. She\u2019d lost faith in the significance of the day and what the day represented.\n\nShe considered not answering. But she knew that if she didn\u2019t answer, one of her roommates would, and then she\u2019d have to explain where she\u2019d disappeared to last night, and with whom. Therefore, Madeleine slid out of the bed and reluctantly stood up.\nThis seemed to go well for a moment, standing up. Her head felt curiously light, as if hollowed out. But then the blood, draining from her skull like sand from an hourglass, hit a bottleneck, and the back of her head exploded in pain.\n\nIn the midst of this barrage, like the furious core from which it emanated, the buzzer erupted again.\n\nShe came out of her bedroom and stumbled in bare feet to the intercom in the hall, slapping the SPEAK button to silence the buzzer.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Didn\u2019t you hear the bell?\u201d It was Alton\u2019s voice, as deep and commanding as ever, despite the fact that it was issuing from a tiny speaker.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cI was in the shower.\u201d\n\n\u201cLikely story. Will you let us in, please?\u201d\n\nMadeleine didn\u2019t want to. She needed to wash up first.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming down,\u201d she said.\n\nThis time, she held down the SPEAK button too long, cutting off Alton\u2019s response. She pressed it again and said, \u201cDaddy?\u201d but while she was speaking, Alton must have been speaking, too, because when she pressed LISTEN all that came through was static.\n\nMadeleine took this pause in communications to lean her forehead against the door frame. The wood felt nice and cool.\n\nThe thought struck her that, if she could keep her face pressed against the soothing wood, she might be able to cure her headache, and if she could keep her forehead pressed against the door frame for the rest of the day, while somehow still being able to leave the apartment, she might make it through breakfast with her parents, march in the commencement procession, get a diploma, and graduate.\n\nShe lifted her face and pressed speak again.\n\u201cDaddy?\u201d\n\nBut it was Phyllida\u2019s voice that answered. \u201cMaddy? What\u2019s the matter? Let us in.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy roommates are still asleep. I\u2019m coming down. Don\u2019t ring the bell anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to see your apartment!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now. I\u2019m coming down. Don\u2019t ring.\u201d\n\nShe took her hand from the buttons and stood back, glaring at the intercom as if daring it to make a sound. When it didn\u2019t, she started back down the hall. She was halfway to the bathroom when her roommate Abby emerged, blocking the way.\n\nShe yawned, running a hand through her big hair, and then, noticing Madeleine, smiled knowingly.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Abby said, \u201cwhere did you sneak off to last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents are here,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cI have to go to breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on. Tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell. I\u2019m late.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re wearing the same clothes, then?\u201d\n\nInstead of replying, Madeleine looked down at herself. Ten hours earlier, when she\u2019d borrowed the black Betsey Johnson dress from Olivia, Madeleine had thought it looked good on her. But now the dress felt hot and sticky, the fat leather belt looked like an S&M restraint, and there was a stain near the hem that she didn\u2019t want to identify.\n\nAbby, meanwhile, had knocked on Olivia\u2019s door and entered. \u201cSo much for Maddy\u2019s broken heart,\u201d she said. \u201cWake up! You\u2019ve got to see this.\u201d\n\nThe path to the bathroom was clear. Madeleine\u2019s need for a shower was extreme, almost medical. At a minimum, she had to brush her teeth.\n\nBut Olivia\u2019s voice was audible now. Soon Madeleine would have two roommates interrogating her. Her parents were liable to start ringing again any minute. As quietly as possible, she inched back down the hall.\n\nShe stepped into a pair of loafers left by the front door, crushing the heels flat as she caught her balance, and escaped into the outer corridor.\n\nThe elevator was waiting at the end of the floral runner. Waiting, Madeleine realized, because she\u2019d failed to close the sliding gate when she\u2019d staggered out of the thing a few hours earlier.\n\nNow she shut the gate securely and pressed the button for the lobby, and with a jolt the antique contraption began to descend through the building\u2019s interior gloom.\n\nMadeleine\u2019s building, a Neo-Romanesque castle called the Narragansett that wrapped around the plunging corner of Benefit Street and Church Street, had been built at the turn of the century.\n\nAmong its surviving period details\u2014the stained-glass skylight, the brass wall sconces, the marble lobby\u2014was the elevator. Made of curving metal bars like a giant birdcage, the elevator miraculously still functioned, but it moved slowly, and as the car dropped, Madeleine took the opportunity to make herself more presentable.\n\nShe ran her hands through her hair, finger-combing it. She polished her front teeth with her index finger. She rubbed mascara crumbs from her eyes and moistened her lips with her tongue. Finally, passing the balustrade on the second floor, she checked her reflection in the small mirror attached to the rear panel.\n\nOne of the nice things about being twenty-two, or about being Madeleine Hanna, was that three weeks of romantic anguish, followed by a night of epic drinking, didn\u2019t do much visible damage. Except for puffiness around her eyes, Madeleine looked like the same pretty, dark-haired person as usual.\n\nThe symmetries of her face\u2014the straight nose, the Katharine Hepburn\u2013ish cheekbones and jawline\u2014were almost mathematical in their precision. Only the slight furrow in her brow gave evidence of the slightly anxious person that Madeleine felt herself, intrinsically, to be.\n\nShe could see her parents waiting below. They were trapped between the lobby door and the door to the street, Alton in a seersucker jacket,\n\nPhyllida in a navy suit and matching gold-buckled purse. For a second, Madeleine had an impulse to stop the elevator and leave her parents stuck in the foyer amid all the college-town clutter\u2014the posters for New Wave bands with names like Wretched Misery or the Clits, the pornographic Egon Schiele drawings by the RISD kid on the second floor, all the clamorous Xeroxes whose subtext conveyed the message that the wholesome, patriotic values of her parents\u2019 generation were now on the ash heap of history, replaced by a nihilistic, post-punk sensibility that Madeleine herself didn\u2019t understand but was perfectly happy to scandalize her parents by pretending that she did\u2014before the elevator stopped in the lobby and she slid open the gate and stepped out to meet them.\n\nAlton was first through the door. \u201cHere she is!\u201d he said avidly. \u201cThe college graduate!\u201d In his net-charging way, he surged forward to seize her in a hug. Madeleine stiffened, worried that she smelled of alcohol or, worse, of sex.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you wouldn\u2019t let us see your apartment,\u201d Phyllida said, coming up next. \u201cI was looking forward to meeting Abby and Olivia. We\u2019d love to treat them to dinner later.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not staying for dinner,\u201d Alton reminded her.\n\n\u201cWell, we might. That depends on Maddy\u2019s schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the plan. The plan is to see Maddy for breakfast and then leave after the ceremony.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father and his plans,\u201d Phyllida said to Madeleine. \u201cAre you wearing that dress to the ceremony?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get used to these shoulder pads all the young women are wearing. They\u2019re so mannish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Olivia\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look pretty whacked out, Mad,\u201d Alton said. \u201cBig party last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything of your own to wear?\u201d Phyllida said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have my robe on, Mummy,\u201d Madeleine said, and, to forestall further inspection, headed past them through the foyer.\n\nOutside, the sun had lost its battle with the clouds and vanished. The weather looked not much better than it had all weekend. Campus Dance, on Friday night, had been more or less rained out. The Baccalaureate service on Sunday had proceeded under a steady drizzle.\n\nNow, on Monday, the rain had stopped, but the temperature felt closer to St. Patrick\u2019s than to Memorial Day.\n\nAs she waited for her parents to join her on the sidewalk, it occurred to Madeleine that she hadn\u2019t had sex, not really. This was some consolation.\n\n\u201cYour sister sends her regrets,\u201d Phyllida said, coming out.\n\n\u201cShe has to take Richard the Lionhearted for an ultrasound today.\u201d\n\nRichard the Lionhearted was Madeleine\u2019s nine-week-old nephew. Everyone else called him Richard.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d Madeleine asked.\n\n\u201cOne of his kidneys is petite, apparently. The doctors want to keep an eye on it. If you ask me, all these ultrasounds do is find things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of ultrasounds,\u201d Alton said, \u201cI need to get one on my knee.\u201d\n\nPhyllida paid no attention. \u201cAnyway, Allie\u2019s devastated not to see you graduate. As is Blake. But they\u2019re hoping you and your new beau might visit them this summer, on your way to the Cape.\u201d\n\nYou had to stay alert around Phyllida. Here she was, ostensibly talking about Richard the Lionhearted\u2019s petite kidney, and already she\u2019d managed to move the subject to Madeleine\u2019s new boyfriend, Leonard (whom Phyllida and Alton hadn\u2019t met), and to Cape Cod (where Madeleine had announced plans to cohabitate with him). On a normal day, when her brain was working, Madeleine would have been able to keep one step ahead of Phyllida, but this morning the best she could manage was to let the words float past her.\n\nFortunately, Alton changed the subject. \u201cSo, where do you recommend for breakfast?\u201d\n\nMadeleine turned and looked vaguely down Benefit Street. \u201cThere\u2019s a place this way.\u201d\n\nShe started shuffling along the sidewalk. Walking\u2014moving\u2014seemed like a good idea. She led them past a line of quaint, nicely maintained houses bearing historical placards, and a big apartment building with a gable roof. Providence was a corrupt town, crime-ridden and mob-controlled, but up on College Hill this was hard to see.\n\nThe sketchy downtown and dying or dead textile mills lay below, in the grim distance. Here the narrow streets, many of them cobblestone, climbed past mansions or snaked around Puritan graveyards full of headstones as narrow as heaven\u2019s door, streets with names like Prospect, Benevolent, Hope, and Meeting, all of them feeding into the arboreous campus at the top.\n\nThe sheer physical elevation suggested an intellectual one.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t these slate sidewalks lovely,\u201d Phyllida said as she followed along.\n\n\u201cWe used to have slate sidewalks on our street.\n\nThey\u2019re much more attractive. But then the borough replaced them with concrete.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssessed us for the bill, too,\u201d\n\nAlton said. He was limping slightly, bringing up the rear. The right leg of his charcoal trousers was swelled from the knee brace he wore on and off the tennis court. Alton had been club champion in his age group for twelve years running, one of those older guys with a sweatband ringing a balding crown, a choppy forehand, and absolute murder in his eyes.\n\nMadeleine had been trying to beat Alton her entire life without success. This was even more infuriating because she was better than he was, at this point. But whenever she took a set from Alton he started intimidating her, acting mean, disputing calls, and her game fell apart.\n\nMadeleine was worried that there was something paradigmatic in this, that she was destined to go through life being cowed by less capable men.\n\nAs a result, Madeleine\u2019s tennis matches against Alton had assumed such outsize personal significance for her that she got tight whenever she played him, with predictable results.\n\nAnd Alton still gloated when he won, still got all rosy and jiggly, as if he\u2019d bested her by sheer talent.\n\nAt the corner of Benefit and Waterman, they crossed behind the white steeple of First Baptist Church. In preparation for the ceremony, loudspeakers had been set up on the lawn.\n\nA man wearing a bow tie, a dean-of-students-looking person, was tensely smoking a cigarette and inspecting a raft of balloons tied to the churchyard fence.\n\nBy now Phyllida had caught up to Madeleine, taking her arm to negotiate the uneven slate, which was pushed up by the roots of gnarled plane trees that lined the curb. As a little girl, Madeleine had thought her mother pretty, but that was a long time ago. Phyllida\u2019s face had gotten heavier over the years; her cheeks were beginning to sag like those of a camel. The conservative clothes she wore\u2014the clothes of a philanthropist or lady ambassador\u2014had a tendency to conceal her figure. Phyllida\u2019s hair was where her power resided. It was expensively set into a smooth dome, like a band shell for the presentation of that long-running act, her face. For as long as Madeleine could remember, Phyllida had never been at a loss for words or shy about a point of etiquette. Among her friends Madeleine liked to make fun of her mother\u2019s formality, but she often found herself comparing other people\u2019s manners unfavorably with Phyllida\u2019s.\n\nAnd right now Phyllida was looking at Madeleine with the proper expression for this moment: thrilled by the pomp and ceremony, eager to put intelligent questions to any of Madeleine\u2019s professors she happened to meet, or to trade pleasantries with fellow parents of graduating seniors.\n\nIn short, she was available to everyone and everything and in step with the social and academic pageantry, all of which exacerbated Madeleine\u2019s feeling of being out of step, for this day and the rest of her life.\n\nShe plunged on, however, across Waterman Street, and up the steps of Carr House, seeking refuge and coffee.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 had just opened. The guy behind the counter, who was wearing Elvis Costello glasses, was rinsing out the espresso machine.\n\nAt a table against the wall, a girl with stiff pink hair was smoking a clove cigarette and reading Invisible Cities. \u201cTainted Love\u201d played from the stereo on top of the refrigerator.\n\nPhyllida, holding her handbag protectively against her chest, had paused to peruse the student art on the walls: six paintings of small, skin-diseased dogs wearing bleach-bottle collars.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this fun?\u201d she said tolerantly.\n\n\u201cLa Boh\u00e8me,\u201d Alton said.\n\nMadeleine installed her parents at a table near the bay window, as far away from the pink-haired girl as possible, and went up to the counter. The guy took his time coming over. She ordered three coffees\u2014a large for her\u2014and bagels. While the bagels were being toasted, she brought the coffees over to her parents.\n\nAlton, who couldn\u2019t sit at the breakfast table without reading, had taken a discarded Village Voice from a nearby table and was perusing it. Phyllida was staring overtly at the girl with pink hair.\n\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s comfortable?\u201d she inquired in a low voice.\n\nMadeleine turned to see that the girl\u2019s ragged black jeans were held together by a few hundred safety pins.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mummy. Why don\u2019t you go ask her?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of getting poked.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to this article,\u201d Alton said, reading the Voice, \u201chomosexuality didn\u2019t exist until the nineteenth century. It was invented. In Germany.\u201d\n\nThe coffee was hot, and lifesavingly good. Sipping it, Madeleine began to feel slightly less awful.\n\nAfter a few minutes, she went up to get the bagels.\n\nThey were a little burned, but she didn\u2019t want to wait for new ones, and so brought them back to the table. After examining his with a sour expression, Alton began scraping it punitively with a plastic knife.\n\nPhyllida asked, \u201cSo, are we going to meet Leonard today?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cAnything you want us to know about?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you two still planning to live together this summer?\u201d\n\nBy this time Madeleine had taken a bite of her bagel. And since the answer to her mother\u2019s question was complicated\u2014strictly speaking, Madeleine and Leonard weren\u2019t planning on living together, because they\u2019d broken up three weeks ago; despite this fact, however, Madeleine hadn\u2019t given up hope of a reconciliation, and seeing as she\u2019d spent so much effort getting her parents used to the idea of her living with a guy, and didn\u2019t want to jeopardize that by admitting that the plan was off\u2014she was relieved to be able to point at her full mouth, which prevented her from replying.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re an adult now,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cYou can do what you like. Though, for the record, I have to say that I don\u2019t approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already gone on record about that,\u201d Alton broke in.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s still a bad idea!\u201d Phyllida cried. \u201cI don\u2019t mean the propriety of it. I\u2019m talking about the practical problems.\n\nIf you move in with Leonard\u2014or any young man\u2014and he\u2019s the one with the job, then you begin at a disadvantage.\n\nWhat happens if you two don\u2019t get along? Where are you then? You won\u2019t have any place to live. Or anything to do.\u201d\n\nThat her mother was correct in her analysis, that the predicament Phyllida warned Madeleine about was exactly the predicament she was already in, didn\u2019t motivate Madeleine to register agreement.\n\n\u201cYou quit your job when you met me,\u201d Alton said to Phyllida.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we change the subject?\u201d Madeleine said at last, having swallowed her food.\n\n\u201cOf course we can, sweetheart. That\u2019s the last I\u2019ll say about it. If your plans change, you can always come home. Your father and I would love to have you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me,\u201d Alton said. \u201cI don\u2019t want her. Moving back home is always a bad idea. Stay away.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe choice is yours,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cBut if you do come home, you could have the loft. That way you can come and go as you like.\u201d\n\nTo her surprise, Madeleine found herself contemplating this proposal.\n\nWhy not tell her parents everything, curl up in the backseat of the car, and let them take her home? She could move into her old bedroom, with the sleigh bed and the Madeline wallpaper.\n\nShe could become a spinster, like Emily Dickinson, writing poems full of dashes and brilliance, and never gaining weight.\n\nPhyllida brought her out of this reverie.\n\n\u201cMaddy?\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that your friend Mitchell?\u201d\n\nMadeleine wheeled in her seat. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s Mitchell. Across the street.\u201d\n\nIn the churchyard, sitting Indian-style in the freshly mown grass, Madeleine\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d Mitchell Grammaticus was indeed there. His lips were moving, as if he was talking to himself.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you invite him to join us?\u201d Phyllida said.\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not? I\u2019d love to see Mitchell.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably waiting for his parents,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nPhyllida waved, despite the fact that Mitchell was too far away to notice.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing sitting on the ground?\u201d Alton asked.\n\nThe three Hannas stared across the street at Mitchell in his half-lotus.\n\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re not going to ask him, I will,\u201d Phyllida finally said.\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll go ask him.\u201d\n\nThe day was getting warmer, but not by much. Black clouds were massing in the distance as Madeleine came down the steps of Carr House and crossed the street into the churchyard.\n\nSomeone inside the church was testing the loudspeakers, fussily repeating, \u201cSussex, Essex, and Kent. Sussex, Essex, and Kent.\u201d A banner draped over the church entrance read \u201cClass of 1982.\u201d Beneath the banner, in the grass, was Mitchell.\n\nHis lips were still moving silently, but when he noticed Madeleine approaching they abruptly stopped.\n\nMadeleine remained a few feet away.\n\n\u201cMy parents are here,\u201d she informed him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s graduation,\u201d Mitchell replied evenly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s parents are here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to say hello to you.\u201d\n\nAt this Mitchell smiled faintly. \u201cThey probably don\u2019t realize you\u2019re not speaking to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cAnd, anyway, I am. Now. Speaking to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder duress or as a change of policy?\u201d\n\nMadeleine shifted her weight, wrinkling her face unhappily. \u201cLook. I\u2019m really hungover. I barely slept last night. My parents have been here about ten minutes and they\u2019re already driving me crazy. So if you could just come over and say hello, that would be great.\u201d\n\nMitchell\u2019s large emotional eyes blinked twice. He was wearing a vintage gabardine shirt, dark wool pants, and beat-up wingtips. Madeleine had never seen him in shorts or tennis shoes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Madeleine said, looking away. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just being my usual vile self.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo was I.\u201d\n\nThey were quiet a moment. Madeleine felt Mitchell\u2019s eyes on her, and she crossed her arms over her chest.\n\nWhat had happened was this: one night the previous December, in a state of anxiety about her romantic life, Madeleine had run into Mitchell on campus and brought him back to her apartment.\n\nShe\u2019d needed male attention and had flirted with him, without entirely admitting it to herself. In her bedroom, Mitchell had picked up a jar of deep-heating gel on her desk, asking what it was for.\n\nMadeleine had explained that people who were athletic sometimes got sore muscles. She understood that Mitchell might not have experienced this phenomenon, seeing as all he did was sit in the library, but he should take her word for it.\n\nAt that point, Mitchell had come up behind her and wiped a gob of heating gel behind her ear. Madeleine jumped up, shouting at Mitchell, and wiped the gunk off with a T-shirt. Though she was within her rights to be angry,\n\nMadeleine also knew (even at the time) that she was using the incident as a pretext for getting Mitchell out of her bedroom and for covering up the fact that she\u2019d been flirting with him in the first place.\n\nThe worst part of the incident was how stricken Mitchell had looked, as if he\u2019d been about to cry. He kept saying he was sorry, he was just joking around, but she ordered him to leave.\n\nIn the following days, replaying the incident in her mind, Madeleine had felt worse and worse about it. She\u2019d been on the verge of calling Mitchell to apologize when she\u2019d received a letter from him, a highly detailed, cogently argued, psychologically astute, quietly hostile four-page letter, in which he called her a \u201ccocktease\u201d and claimed that her behavior that night had been \u201cthe erotic equivalent of bread and circus, with just the circus.\u201d\n\nThe next time they\u2019d run into each other, Madeleine had acted as if she didn\u2019t know him, and they hadn\u2019t spoken since.\n\nNow, in the churchyard of First Baptist, Mitchell looked up at her and said, \u201cO.K. Let\u2019s go say hello to your parents.\u201d\n\nPhyllida was waving as they came up the steps. In the flirtatious voice she reserved for her favorite of Madeleine\u2019s friends, she called out, \u201cI thought that was you on the ground. You looked like a swami!\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Mitchell!\u201d Alton said, heartily shaking Mitchell\u2019s hand. \u201cBig day today. One of the milestones. A new generation takes the reins.\u201d\n\nThey invited Mitchell to sit down and asked him if he wanted anything to eat. Madeleine went back to the counter to get more coffee, glad to have Mitchell keeping her parents occupied. As she watched him, in his old man\u2019s clothes, engaging Alton and Phyllida in conversation, Madeleine thought to herself, as she\u2019d thought many times before, that Mitchell was the kind of smart, sane, parent-pleasing boy she should fall in love with and marry. That she would never fall in love with Mitchell and marry him, precisely because of this eligibility, was yet another indication, in a morning teeming with them, of just how screwed up she was in matters of the heart.\n\nWhen she returned to the table, no one acknowledged her.\n\n\u201cSo, Mitchell,\u201d Phyllida was asking, \u201cwhat are your plans after graduation?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s been asking me the same question,\u201d Mitchell answered. \u201cFor some reason he thinks Religious Studies isn\u2019t a marketable degree.\u201d\n\nMadeleine smiled for the first time all day. \u201cSee? Mitchell doesn\u2019t have a job lined up, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I sort of do,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cYou do not,\u201d Madeleine challenged him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. I do.\u201d He explained that he and his roommate, Larry Pleshette, had come up with a plan to fight the recession. As liberal-arts degree holders matriculating into the job market at a time when unemployment was at 9.5 percent, they had decided, after much consideration, to leave the country and stay away as long as possible.\n\nAt the end of the summer, after they\u2019d saved up enough money, they were going to backpack through Europe. After they\u2019d seen everything in Europe there was to see, they were going to fly to India and stay there as long as their money held out. The whole trip would take eight or nine months, maybe as long as a year.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to India?\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be research assistants,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cFor Prof. Hughes.\u201d\n\n\u201cProf. Hughes in the theater department?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw a program about India recently,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cIt was terribly depressing. The poverty!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a plus for me, Mrs. Hanna,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI thrive in squalor.\u201d\n\nPhyllida, who couldn\u2019t resist this sort of mischief, gave up her solemnity, rippling with amusement. \u201cThen you\u2019re going to the right place!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take a trip, too,\u201d Madeleine said in a threatening tone.\n\nNo one reacted. Instead Alton asked Mitchell, \u201cWhat sort of immunizations do you need for India?\u201d\n\n\u201cCholera and typhus. Gamma globulin\u2019s optional.\u201d\n\nPhyllida shook her head. \u201cYour mother must be worried sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was in the service,\u201d Alton said, \u201cthey shot us up with a million things. Didn\u2019t even tell us what the shots were for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll move to Paris,\u201d Madeleine said in a louder voice. \u201cInstead of getting a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cMitchell,\u201d Phyllida continued, \u201cwith your interest in religious studies, I\u2019d think India would be a perfect fit. They\u2019ve got everything. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Jains, Buddhists.\n\nIt\u2019s like Baskin and Robbins! I\u2019ve always been fascinated by religion. Unlike my doubting-Thomas husband.\u201d\n\nAlton winked. \u201cI doubt that doubting Thomas existed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know Paul Moore, Bishop Moore, at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine?\u201d\n\nPhyllida said, keeping Mitchell\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great friend. You might find it interesting to meet him. We\u2019d be happy to introduce you. When we\u2019re in the city, I always go to services at the cathedral. Have you ever been there? Oh. Well. How can I describe it? It\u2019s simply\u2014well, simply divine!\u201d\n\nPhyllida held a hand to her throat with the pleasure of this bon mot, while Mitchell obligingly, even convincingly, laughed.\n\n\u201cSpeaking of religious dignitaries,\u201d\n\nAlton cut in, \u201cdid I ever tell you about the time we met the Dalai Lama?\n\nIt was at this fund-raiser at the Waldorf. We were in the receiving line. Must have been three hundred people at least. Anyway, when we finally got up to the Dalai Lama, I asked him,\n\n\u2018Are you any relation to Dolly Parton?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI was mortified!\u201d Phyllida cried. \u201cAbsolutely mortified.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaddy,\u201d Madeleine said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should get going if you want to get a good spot.\u201d\n\nAlton looked at his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gets really crowded,\u201d Madeleine emphasized. \u201cYou should go now.\u201d\n\nAlton and Phyllida looked at Mitchell, as if they trusted him to advise them. Under the table, Madeleine kicked him, and he alertly responded, \u201cIt does get pretty crowded.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the best place to stand?\u201d Alton asked, again addressing Mitchell.\n\n\u201cBy the Van Wickle Gates. At the top of College Street. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll come through.\u201d\n\nAlton stood up from the table. After shaking Mitchell\u2019s hand, he bent to kiss Madeleine on the cheek.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see you later. Miss Baccalaureate, 1982.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Mitchell,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cSo nice to see you.\n\nAnd remember, when you\u2019re on your Grand Tour, be sure to send your mother loads of letters. Otherwise, she\u2019ll be frantic.\u201d\n\nTo Madeleine, she said, \u201cYou might change that dress before the march. It has a visible stain.\u201d\n\nWith that, Alton and Phyllida, in their glaring parental actuality, all seersucker and handbag, cuff links and pearls, crossed the beige-and-brick space of Carr House and went out the door.\n\nAs though to signal their departure, a new song came on: Joe Jackson\u2019s high-pitched voice swooping above a synthesized drumbeat. The guy behind the counter cranked up the volume.\n\nMadeleine laid her head on the table, her hair covering her face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never drinking again,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFamous last words.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have no idea what\u2019s been going on with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could I? You haven\u2019t been speaking to me.\u201d\n\nWithout lifting her cheek from the table, Madeleine said in a pitiful voice, \u201cI\u2019m homeless. I\u2019m graduating from college and I\u2019m a homeless person.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am!\u201d Madeleine insisted. \u201cFirst I was supposed to move to New York with Abby and Olivia. Then it looked like I was moving to the Cape, though, so I told them to get another roommate. And now I\u2019m not moving to the Cape and I have nowhere to go. My mother wants me to move back home but I\u2019d rather kill myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m moving back home for the summer,\u201d\n\nMitchell said. \u201cTo Detroit. At least you\u2019re near New York.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard back from grad school yet and it\u2019s June,\u201d Madeleine continued.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to find out over a month ago! I could call the admissions department, but I don\u2019t because I\u2019m scared to find out that I\u2019ve been rejected. As long as I don\u2019t know, I still have hope.\u201d\n\nThere was a moment before Mitchell spoke again. \u201cYou can come to India with me,\u201d he said.\n\nMadeleine opened one eye to see, through a whorl in her hair, that Mitchell wasn\u2019t entirely joking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even about grad school,\u201d she said. Taking a deep breath, she confessed, \u201cLeonard and I broke up.\u201d\n\nIt felt deeply pleasurable to say this, to name her sadness, and so Madeleine was surprised by the coldness of Mitchell\u2019s reply.\n\n\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d he said.\n\nShe lifted her head, brushing her hair out of her face. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You wanted to know what was the matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, actually. I didn\u2019t even ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you might care,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cSince you\u2019re my friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Mitchell said, his voice suddenly sarcastic.\n\n\u201cOur wonderful friendship! Our \u2018friendship\u2019 isn\u2019t a real friendship because it only works on your terms.\n\nYou set the rules, Madeleine. If you decide you don\u2019t want to talk to me for three months, we don\u2019t talk. Then you decide you do want to talk to me because you need me to entertain your parents\u2014and now we\u2019re talking again. We\u2019re friends when you want to be friends, and we\u2019re never more than friends because you don\u2019t want to be. And I have to go along with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Madeleine said, feeling put-upon and blindsided. \u201cI just don\u2019t like you that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Mitchell cried. \u201cYou\u2019re not attracted to me physically. O.K., fine. But who says I was ever attracted to you mentally?\u201d\n\nMadeleine reacted as if she\u2019d been slapped. She was outraged, hurt, and defiant all at once.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a\u201d\u2014she tried to think of the worst thing to say\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re such a jerk!\u201d\n\nShe was hoping to remain imperious, but her chest was stinging, and, to her dismay, she burst into tears.\n\nMitchell reached out to touch her arm, but Madeleine shook him off. Getting to her feet, trying not to look like someone angrily weeping, she went out the door and down the steps onto Waterman Street.\n\nConfronted by the festive churchyard, she turned downhill toward the river. She wanted to get away from campus. Her headache had returned, her temples were throbbing, and as she looked up at the storm clouds massing over downtown like more bad things to come, she asked herself why everyone was being so mean to her.\n\n\n\nMadeleine\u2019s love troubles had begun at a time when the French theory she was reading deconstructed the very notion of love. Semiotics 211 was an upper-level seminar taught by a former English department renegade.\n\nMichael Zipperstein had come to Brown thirty-two years earlier as a New Critic. He\u2019d inculcated the habits of close reading and biography-free interpretation into three generations of students before taking a Road to Damascus sabbatical, in Paris, in 1975, where he\u2019d met Roland Barthes at a dinner party and been converted, over cassoulet, to the new faith.\n\nNow Zipperstein taught two courses in the newly created Program in Semiotics Studies: Introduction to Semiotic Theory in the fall and, in the spring, Semiotics 211. Hygienically bald, with a seaman\u2019s mustacheless white beard, Zipperstein favored French fisherman\u2019s sweaters and wide-wale corduroys. He buried people with his reading lists: in addition to all the semiotic big hitters\u2014Derrida, Eco, Barthes\u2014the students in Semiotics 211 had to contend with a magpie nest of reserve reading that included everything from Balzac\u2019s Sarrasine to issues of Semiotext(e) to photocopied selections from E. M. Cioran, Robert Walser, Claude Levi-Strauss, Peter Handke, and Carl Van Vechten.\n\nTo get into the seminar, you had to submit to a one-on-one interview with Zipperstein during which he asked bland personal questions, such as what your favorite food or dog breed was, and made enigmatic Warholian remarks in response. This esoteric probing, along with Zipperstein\u2019s guru\u2019s dome and beard, gave his students a sense that they\u2019d been spiritually vetted and were now\u2014for two hours on Thursday afternoons, at least\u2014part of a campus lit-crit elite.\n\nWhich was exactly what Madeleine wanted. She\u2019d become an English major for the purest and dullest of reasons: because she loved to read.\n\nThe university\u2019s \u201cBritish and American Literature Course Catalog\u201d was, for Madeleine, what its Bergdorf equivalent was for her roommates.\n\nA course listing like \u201cEnglish 274: Lyly\u2019s Euphues\u201d excited Madeleine the way a pair of Fiorucci cowboy boots did Abby. \u201cEnglish 450A:\n\nHawthorne and James\u201d filled Madeleine with an expectation of sinful hours in bed not unlike what Olivia got from wearing a Lycra skirt and leather blazer to Danceteria. Even as a girl in their house in Prettybrook, Madeleine wandered into the library, with its shelves of books rising higher than she could reach\u2014newly purchased volumes such as Love Story or Myra Breckinridgethat exuded a faintly forbidden air, as well as venerable leather-bound editions of Fielding,\n\nThackeray, and Dickens\u2014and the magisterial presence of all those potentially readable words stopped her in her tracks. She could scan book spines for as long as an hour. Her cataloging of the family\u2019s holdings rivaled the Dewey decimal system in its comprehensiveness.\n\nMadeleine knew right where everything was. The shelves near the fireplace held Alton\u2019s favorites, biographies of American presidents and British prime ministers, memoirs by warmongering secretaries of state, novels about sailing or espionage by William F. Buckley, Jr. Phyllida\u2019s books filled the left side of the bookcases leading up to the parlor, NYRB-reviewed novels and essay collections, as well as coffee-table volumes about English gardens or chinoiserie.\n\nEven now, at bed-and-breakfasts or seaside hotels, a shelf full of forlorn books always cried out to Madeleine. She ran her fingers over their salt-spotted covers. She peeled apart pages made tacky by ocean air. She had no sympathy for paperback thrillers and detective stories.\n\nIt was the abandoned hardback, the jacketless 1931 Dial Press edition ringed with many a coffee cup, that pierced Madeleine\u2019s heart. Her friends might be calling her name on the beach, the clambake already under way, but Madeleine would sit down on the bed and read for a little while to make the sad old book feel better. She had read Longfellow\u2019s \u201cHiawatha\u201d that way. She\u2019d read James Fenimore Cooper. She\u2019d read H. M. Pulham, Esquire by John P. Marquand.\n\nAnd yet sometimes she worried about what those musty old books were doing to her. Some people majored in English to prepare for law school. Others became journalists. The smartest guy in the honors program, Adam Vogel, a child of academics, was planning on getting a Ph.D. and becoming an academic himself.\n\nThat left a large contingent of people majoring in English by default. Because they weren\u2019t left-brained enough for science, because history was too dry, philosophy too difficult, geology too petroleum-oriented, and math too mathematical\u2014because they weren\u2019t musical, artistic, financially motivated, or really all that smart, these people were pursuing university degrees doing something no different from what they\u2019d done in first grade: reading stories.\n\nEnglish was what people who didn\u2019t know what to major in majored in.\n\nHer junior year, Madeleine had taken an honors seminar called The Marriage Plot: Selected Novels of Austen, Eliot, and James.\n\nThe class was taught by K. McCall Saunders. Saunders was a seventy-nine-year-old New Englander. He had a long, horsey face and a moist laugh that exposed his gaudy dental work. His pedagogical method consisted of his reading aloud lectures he\u2019d written twenty or thirty years earlier.\n\nMadeleine stayed in the class because she felt sorry for Professor Saunders and because the reading list was so good. In Saunders\u2019s opinion, the novel had reached its apogee with the marriage plot and had never recovered from its disappearance. In the days when success in life had depended on marriage, and marriage had depended on money, novelists had had a subject to write about. The great epics sang of war, the novel of marriage.\n\nSexual equality, good for women, had been bad for the novel. And divorce had undone it completely.\n\nWhat would it matter whom Emma married if she could file for separation later?\n\nHow would Isabel Archer\u2019s marriage to Gilbert Osmond have been affected by the existence of a prenup?\n\nAs far as Saunders was concerned, marriage didn\u2019t mean much anymore, and neither did the novel. Where could you find the marriage plot nowadays? You couldn\u2019t. You had to read historical fiction. You had to read non-Western novels involving traditional societies. Afghani novels, Indian novels. You had to go, literarily speaking, back in time.\n\nMadeleine\u2019s final paper for the seminar was titled \u201cThe Interrogative Mood: Marriage Proposals and the (Strictly Limited) Sphere of the Feminine.\u201d\n\nIt had impressed Saunders so much that he\u2019d asked Madeleine to come see him. In his office, which had a grandparental smell, he expressed his opinion that Madeleine might expand her paper into a senior honors thesis, along with his willingness to serve as her advisor.\n\nMadeleine smiled politely. Professor Saunders specialized in the periods she was interested in, the Regency leading into the Victorian era. He was sweet, and learned, and it was clear from his unsubscribed office hours that no one else wanted him as an advisor, and so Madeleine had said yes, she would love to work with him on her senior thesis.\n\nShe used a line from Trollope\u2019s Barchester Towers as an epigraph:\n\n\u201cThere is no happiness in love, except at the end of an English novel.\u201d\n\nHer plan was to begin with Jane Austen. After a brief examination of Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, and Sense and Sensibility, all comedies, essentially, that ended with weddings, Madeleine was going to move on to the Victorian novel, where things got more complicated and considerably darker. Middlemarch and The Portrait of a Lady didn\u2019t end with weddings.\n\nThey began with the traditional moves of the marriage plot\u2014the suitors, the proposals, the misunderstandings\u2014but after the wedding ceremony they kept on going. These novels followed their spirited, intelligent heroines, Dorothea Brooke and Isabel Archer, into their disappointing married lives, and it was here that the marriage plot reached its greatest artistic expression.\n\nBy 1900 the marriage plot was no more. Madeleine planned to end with a brief discussion of its demise.\n\nIn Sister Carrie, Dreiser had Carrie live adulterously with Drouet, marry Hurstwood in an invalid ceremony, and then run off to become an actress\u2014and this was only in 1900! For a conclusion, Madeleine thought she might cite the wife-swapping in Updike.\n\nThat was the last vestige of the marriage plot: the persistence in calling it \u201cwife-swapping\u201d instead of \u201chusband-swapping.\u201d As if the woman were still a piece of property to be passed around.\n\nProfessor Saunders suggested that Madeleine look at historical sources. She\u2019d obediently boned up on the rise of industrialism and the nuclear family, the formation of the middle class, and the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857. But it wasn\u2019t long before she\u2019d become bored with the thesis. Doubts about the originality of her work nagged at her.\n\nShe felt as if she was regurgitating the arguments Saunders had made in his marriage plot seminar. Her meetings with the old professor were dispiriting, consisting of Saunders shuffling the pages she\u2019d given him, pointing out various red marks he\u2019d made in the margins.\n\nThen one Sunday morning, before winter break, Abby\u2019s boyfriend, Whitney, materialized at their kitchen table, reading something called Of Grammatology.\n\nWhen Madeleine asked what the book was about, she was given to understand by Whitney that the idea of a book being \u201cabout\u201d something was exactly what this book was against, and that, if it was \u201cabout\u201d anything, then it was about the need to stop thinking of books as being about things.\n\nMadeleine said she was going to make coffee. Whitney asked if she would make him some, too.\n\nCollege wasn\u2019t like the real world. In the real world people dropped names based on their renown.\n\nIn college, people dropped names based on their obscurity. Thus, in the weeks after this exchange with Whitney, Madeleine began hearing people saying \u201cDerrida.\u201d She heard them saying \u201cLyotard\u201d and \u201cFoucault\u201d and \u201cDeleuze\u201d and \u201cBaudrillard.\u201d\n\nThat most of these people were those she instinctually disapproved of\u2014upper-middle-class kids who wore Doc Martens and anarchist symbols\u2014made Madeleine dubious about the value of their enthusiasm. But soon she noticed David Koppel, a smart and talented poet, also reading Derrida.\n\nAnd Pookie Ames, who read slush for The Paris Review and whom Madeleine liked, was taking a course with Professor Zipperstein.\n\nMadeleine had always been partial to grandiose professors, people like Sears Jayne who hammed it up in the classroom, reciting Hart Crane or\n\nAnne Sexton in a gag voice. Whitney acted as though Professor Jayne was a joke. Madeleine didn\u2019t agree. But after three solid years of taking literature courses, Madeleine had nothing like a firm critical methodology to apply to what she read.\n\nInstead she had a fuzzy, unsystematic way of talking about books. It embarrassed her to hear the things people said in class. And the things she said. I felt that. It was interesting the way Proust. I liked the way Faulkner.\n\nAnd when Olivia, who was tall and slim, with a long, aristocratic nose like a saluki, came in one day carrying Of Grammatology, Madeleine knew that what had been marginal was now mainstream.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that book like?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t read it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould I be asking if I had?\u201d\n\nOlivia sniffed. \u201cAren\u2019t we a little bitchy today?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust kidding. It\u2019s great. Derrida is my absolute god!\u201d\n\nAlmost overnight it became laughable to read writers like Cheever or Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about anally deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France.\n\nThe reason de Sade was preferable was that his shocking sex scenes weren\u2019t about sex but politics. They were therefore anti-imperialist, anti-bourgeois, anti-patriarchal, and anti-everything a smart young feminist should be against. Right up through her third year at college, Madeleine kept wholesomely taking courses like Victorian Fantasy: From Phantastes to The Water-Babies, but by senior year she could no longer ignore the contrast between the hard-up, blinky people in her Beowulf seminar and the hipsters down the hall reading Maurice Blanchot.\n\nGoing to college in the moneymaking eighties lacked a certain radicalism. Semiotics was the first thing that smacked of revolution. It drew a line; it created an elect; it was sophisticated and Continental; it dealt with provocative subjects, with torture, sadism, hermaphroditism\u2014with sex and power.\n\nMadeleine had always been popular at school. Years of being popular had left her with the reflexive ability to separate the cool from the uncool, even within subgroups, like the English department, where the concept of cool didn\u2019t appear to obtain.\n\nIf Restoration drama was getting you down, if scanning Wordsworth was making you feel dowdy and ink-stained, there was another option. You could flee K. McCall Saunders and the old New Criticism. You could defect to the new imperium of Derrida and Eco. You could sign up for Semiotics 211 and find out what everyone else was talking about.\n\n\n\nSemiotics 211 was limited to ten students. Of the ten, eight had taken Introduction to Semiotic Theory. This was visually apparent at the first class meeting.\n\nLounging around the seminar table, when Madeleine came into the room from the wintry weather outside, were eight people in black T-shirts and ripped black jeans. A few had razored off the necks or sleeves of their T-shirts. There was something creepy about one guy\u2019s face\u2014it was like a baby\u2019s face that had grown whiskers\u2014and it took Madeleine a full minute to realize that he\u2019d shaved off his eyebrows.\n\nEveryone in the room was so spectral-looking that Madeleine\u2019s natural healthiness seemed suspect, like a vote for Reagan. She was relieved, therefore, when a big guy in a down jacket and snowmobile boots showed up and took the empty seat next to her. He had a cup of take-out coffee.\n\nZipperstein asked the students to introduce themselves and explain why they were taking the seminar.\n\nThe boy without eyebrows spoke up first. \u201cUm, let\u2019s see. I\u2019m finding it hard to introduce myself, actually, because the whole idea of social introductions is so problematized.\n\nLike, if I tell you that my name is Thurston Meems and that I grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, will you know who I am? O.K.\n\nMy name\u2019s Thurston and I\u2019m from Stamford, Connecticut. I\u2019m taking this course because I read Of Grammatology last summer and it blew my mind.\u201d\n\nWhen it was the turn of the boy next to Madeleine, he said in a quiet voice that he was a double major (biology and philosophy) and had never taken a semiotics course before, that his parents had named him Leonard, that it had always seemed pretty handy to have a name, especially when you were being called to dinner, and that if anyone wanted to call him Leonard he would answer to it.\n\nLeonard didn\u2019t make another comment. During the rest of the class, he leaned back in his chair, stretching out his long legs. After he finished his coffee, he dug into his right snowmobile boot and, to Madeleine\u2019s surprise, pulled out a tin of chewing tobacco. With two stained fingers, he placed a wad of tobacco in his cheek. For the next two hours, every minute or so, he spat, discreetly but audibly, into the cup.\n\nEvery week Zipperstein assigned one daunting book of theory and one literary selection. The pairings were eccentric if not downright arbitrary. (What did Saussure\u2019s Writings in General Linguistics, for instance, have to do with Pynchon\u2019s The Crying of Lot 49?) As for Zipperstein himself, he didn\u2019t run the class so much as observe it from behind the one-way mirror of his opaque personality. He hardly said a word. He asked questions now and then to stimulate discussion, and often went to the window to gaze in the direction of Narragansett Bay, as if thinking about his wooden sloop in dry dock.\n\nThree weeks into the course, on a February day of flurries and gray skies, they read Zipperstein\u2019s own book, The Making of Signs, along with Peter Handke\u2019s A Sorrow Beyond Dreams.\n\nIt was always embarrassing when professors assigned their own books. Even Madeleine, who found all the reading hard going, could tell that Zipperstein\u2019s contribution to the field was reformulative and second-tier.\n\nEveryone seemed a little hesitant when talking about The Making of Signs, so it was a relief when, after the break, they turned to the literary selection.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Zipperstein asked, blinking behind his round wire-rims. \u201cWhat did you make of the Handke?\u201d\n\nAfter a short silence, Thurston spoke up. \u201cThe Handke was totally dank and depressing,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved it.\u201d\n\nThurston was a sly-looking boy with short, gelled hair. His eyebrowlessness, along with his pale complexion, gave his face a superintelligent quality, like a floating, disembodied brain.\n\n\u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cWell, Professor, here\u2019s a subject dear to my heart\u2014offing yourself.\u201d The other students tittered as Thurston warmed to his topic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s purportedly autobiographical, this book. But I\u2019d contend, with Barthes, that the act of writing is itself a fictionalization, even if you\u2019re treating actual events.\u201d\n\nBart. So that was how you pronounced it. Madeleine made a note, grateful to be spared humiliation.\n\nMeanwhile Thurston was saying, \u201cSo Handke\u2019s mother commits suicide and Handke sits down to write about it. He wants to be as objective as possible, to be totally\u2014remorseless!\u201d\n\nThurston stifled a smile. He aspired to be a person who would react to his own mother\u2019s suicide with high-literary remorselessness, and his soft, young face lit up with pleasure. \u201cSuicide is a trope,\u201d he announced.\n\n\u201cEspecially in German literature. You\u2019ve got The Sorrows of Young Werther. You\u2019ve got Kleist. Hey, I just thought of something.\u201d He held up a finger.\n\n\u201cThe Sorrows of Young Werther.\u201d He held up another finger.\n\n\u201cA Sorrow Beyond Dreams. My theory is that Handke felt the weight of all that tradition and this book was his attempt to break free.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you mean \u2018free\u2019?\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cFrom the whole Teutonic, Sturm-und-Drang, suicidal thing.\u201d\n\nThe flurries swirling outside the windows looked like either flakes of soap or flash of ash, like something either very clean or very dirty.\n\n\u201cThe Sorrows of Young Werther is an apt reference,\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cBut I think that\u2019s more the translator\u2019s doing than Handke\u2019s. In German the book\u2019s called Wunschloses Ungl\u00fcck.\u201d\n\nThurston smiled, either because he was pleased to be receiving Zipperstein\u2019s full attention or because he thought German sounded funny.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a play on a German saying, wunschlos gl\u00fccklich, which means being happier than you could ever wish for. Only here Handke makes a nice reversal. It\u2019s a serious and strangely wonderful title.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it means being unhappier than you could ever wish for,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nZipperstein looked at her for the first time.\n\n\u201cIn a sense. As I said, something is lost in translation. What was your take?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the book?\u201d Madeleine asked, and immediately realized how stupid this sounded. She fell silent, the blood beating in her ears.\n\nPeople blushed in nineteenth-century English novels but never in contemporary Austrian ones.\n\nBefore the silence became uncomfortable, Leonard came to her rescue.\n\n\u201cI have a comment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was going to write about my mother\u2019s suicide, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be too concerned about being experimental.\u201d He leaned forward, putting his elbows on the table.\n\n\u201cI mean, wasn\u2019t anybody put off by Handke\u2019s so-called remorselessness? Didn\u2019t this book strike anyone as a tad cold?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter cold than sentimental,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cDo you think? Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019ve read the sentimental, filial account of a cherished dead parent before. We\u2019ve read it a million times. It doesn\u2019t have any power anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing a little thought experiment here,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cSay my mother killed herself. And say I wrote a book about it.\n\nWhy would I want to do something like that?\u201d He closed his eyes and leaned his head back.\n\n\u201cFirst, I\u2019d do it to cope with my grief. Second, maybe to paint a portrait of my mother. To keep her alive in my memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think your reaction is universal,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cThat because you\u2019d respond to the death of a parent a certain way, that obligates Handke to do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that if your mother kills herself it\u2019s not a literary trope.\u201d\n\nMadeleine\u2019s heart had quieted now. She was listening to the discussion with interest.\n\nThurston was nodding his head in a way that somehow didn\u2019t suggest agreement.\n\n\u201cYeah, O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cHandke\u2019s real mother killed herself. She died in a real world and Handke felt real grief or whatever. But that\u2019s not what this book\u2019s about. Books aren\u2019t about \u2018real life.\u2019 Books are about other books.\u201d He raised his mouth like a wind instrument and blew out bright notes.\n\n\u201cMy theory is that the problem Handke was trying to solve here, from a literary standpoint, was how do you write about something, even something real and painful\u2014like suicide\u2014when all of the writing that\u2019s been done on that subject has robbed you of any originality of expression?\u201d\n\nWhat Thurston was saying seemed to Madeleine both insightful and horribly wrong. It was maybe true, what he said, but it shouldn\u2019t have been.\n\n\u201c\u2018Popular literature,\u2019\u201d Zipperstein quipped, proposing an essay title. \u201c\u2018Or, How to Beat a Dead Horse.\u2019\u201d\n\nA spasm of mirth traveled through the class. Madeleine looked over to see that Leonard was staring at her. When the class ended, he gathered up his books and left.\n\nShe started seeing Leonard around after that. She saw him crossing the green one afternoon, hatless in winter drizzle. She saw him at Mutt & Geoff\u2019s, eating a messy Buddy Cianci sandwich. She saw him, one morning, waiting for a bus on South Main. Each time, Leonard was alone, looking forlorn and uncombed like a great big motherless boy. At the same time, he appeared somehow older than most guys at school.\n\nIt was Madeleine\u2019s last semester of senior year, a time when she was supposed to have some fun, and she wasn\u2019t having any. She\u2019d never thought of herself as hard up. She preferred to think of her current boyfriendless state as salutary and head-clearing. But when she found herself wondering what it would be like to kiss a guy who chewed tobacco, she began to worry that she was fooling herself.\n\nLooking back, Madeleine realized that her college love life had fallen short of expectations. Her freshman roommate, Jennifer Boomgaard, had rushed off to Health Services the first week of school to be fitted for a diaphragm. Unaccustomed to sharing a room with anybody, much less a stranger, Madeleine felt that Jenny was a little too quick with her intimacies. She didn\u2019t want to be shown Jennifer\u2019s diaphragm, which reminded her of an uncooked ravioli, and she certainly didn\u2019t want to feel the spermicidal jelly that Jenny offered to squirt into her palm. Madeleine was shocked when Jennifer started going to parties with the diaphragm already in place, when she wore it to the Harvard-Brown game, and when she left it one morning on top of their miniature fridge. That winter, when the Rev. Desmond Tutu came to campus for an anti-apartheid rally, Madeleine asked Jennifer on their way to see the great cleric, \u201cDid you put your diaphragm in?\u201d They lived the next four months in an eighteen-by-fifteen room without speaking to each other.\n\nThough Madeleine hadn\u2019t arrived at college sexually inexperienced, her freshman learning curve resembled a flat line. Aside from one make-out session with a Uruguayan named Carlos, a sandal-wearing engineering student who in low light looked like Che Guevara, the only boy she\u2019d fooled around with was a high school senior visiting campus for Early Action weekend. She found Tim standing in line at the Ratty, pushing his cafeteria tray along the metal track, and visibly quivering. His blue blazer was too big for him. He\u2019d spent the entire day wandering around campus with no one speaking to him. Now he was starving and wasn\u2019t sure if he was allowed to eat in the cafeteria or not. Tim seemed to be the only person at Brown more lost than Madeleine. She helped him negotiate the Ratty and, afterward, took him on a tour of the university. Finally, around ten-thirty that night, they ended up back in Madeleine\u2019s dorm room. Tim had the long-lashed eyes and pretty features of an expensive Bavarian doll, a little prince or yodeling shepherd boy. His blue blazer was on the floor and Madeleine\u2019s shirt unbuttoned when Jennifer Boomgaard came through the door. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201csorry,\u201d and proceeded to stand there, smiling at the floor as if already relishing how this juicy bit of gossip would play along the hall. When she finally did leave, Madeleine sat up and readjusted her clothes, and Tim picked up his blazer and went back to high school.\n\nAt Christmas, when Madeleine went home for vacation, she thought the scale in her parents\u2019 bathroom was broken. She got off to recalibrate the dial and got back on, whereupon the scale again registered the same weight. Stepping in front of the mirror, Madeleine encountered a worried chipmunk staring back.\n\n\u201cAm I not getting asked out because I\u2019m fat,\u201d the chipmunk said, \u201cor am I fat because I\u2019m not getting asked out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never got the freshman fifteen,\u201d her sister gloated when Madeleine came down to breakfast.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t pig out like all my friends did.\u201d Accustomed to Alwyn\u2019s teasing, Madeleine paid no attention, quietly slicing and eating the first of the fifty-seven grapefruits she subsisted on until New Year\u2019s.\n\nDieting fooled you into thinking you could control your life. By January, Madeleine was down five pounds, and by the time squash season ended she was back in great shape, and still she didn\u2019t meet anyone she liked. The boys at college seemed either incredibly immature or prematurely middle-aged, bearded like therapists, warming brandy snifters over candles while listening to Coltrane\u2019s A Love Supreme. It wasn\u2019t until her junior year that Madeleine had a serious boyfriend. Billy Bainbridge was the son of Dorothy Bainbridge, whose uncle owned a third of the newspapers in the United States. Billy had flushed cheeks, blond curls, and a scar on his right temple that made him even more adorable than he already was. He was soft-spoken and nice-smelling, like Ivory soap. Naked, his body was nearly hairless.\n\nBilly didn\u2019t like to talk about his family. Madeleine took this as a sign of good breeding. Billy was a legacy at Brown and sometimes worried that he wouldn\u2019t have gotten in on his own. Sex with Billy was cozy, it was snuggly, it was perfectly fine. He wanted to be a filmmaker. The one film he made for Advanced Filmmaking, however, was a violent, unbroken twelve minutes of Billy throwing fecal-looking brownie mix at the camera. Madeleine began to wonder if there was a reason he never talked about his family.\n\nOne thing he did talk about, however, with increasing intensity, was circumcision. Billy had read an article in an alternative health magazine that argued against the practice, and it made a big impression on him.\n\n\u201cIf you think about it, it\u2019s a pretty weird thing to do to a baby,\u201d he said. \u201cCut off part of its dick? What\u2019s so different about a tribe in, like, Papua New Guinea putting bones through their noses and cutting off a baby\u2019s foreskin? A bone through the nose is a lot less invasive.\u201d Madeleine listened, trying to look sympathetic, and hoped Billy would drop the subject. But as the weeks passed he kept returning to it.\n\n\u201cThe doctors just do it automatically in this country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask my parents. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m Jewish or anything.\u201d He derided justifications on the basis of health or hygiene. \u201cMaybe that made sense three thousand years ago, out in the desert, when you couldn\u2019t take a shower. But now?\u201d\n\nOne night, as they were lying in bed, naked, Madeleine noticed Billy examining his penis, stretching it.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for the scar,\u201d he said somberly.\n\nHe interrogated his European friends, Henrik the Intact, Olivier the Foreskinned, asking,\n\n\u201cBut does it feel supersensitive?\u201d Billy was convinced that he\u2019d been deprived of sensation. Madeleine tried not to take this personally. Plus there were other problems with their relationship by then. Billy had a habit of staring deeply into Madeleine\u2019s eyes in a way that was somehow controlling. His roommate situation was odd. He lived off campus with an attractive, muscular girl named Kyle who was sleeping with at least three people, including Fatima Shirazi, a niece of the shah of Iran. On the wall of his living room Billy had painted the words Kill the Father. Killing the father was what, in Billy\u2019s opinion, college was all about.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s your father?\u201d he asked Madeleine. \u201cIs it Virginia Woolf? Is it Sontag?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my case,\u201d Madeleine said, \u201cmy father really is my father.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you have to kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s your father?\u201d\n\n\u201cGodard,\u201d he said.\n\nBilly talked about renting a house in Guanajuato with Madeleine over the summer. He said she could write a novel while he made a film. His faith in her, in her writing (even though she hardly wrote any fiction), made Madeleine feel so good that she started going along with the idea. And then one day she came up onto Billy\u2019s front porch and was about to rap on his window when something told her to look in the window instead. In the storm-tossed bed, Billy lay curled, John Lennon\u2013style, against the spread-eagled Kyle. Both were naked. A second later, in a puff of smoke, Fatima materialized, also naked, shaking baby powder over her gleaming Persian skin. She smiled at her bedmates, her teeth seed-like in purple, royal gums.\n\nMaddy\u2019s next boyfriend wasn\u2019t strictly her fault. She would never have met Dabney Carlisle if she hadn\u2019t taken an acting class, and she would never have taken an acting class if it hadn\u2019t been for her mother. As a young woman, Phyllida had wanted to be an actress. Her parents had been opposed, however.\n\n\u201cActing wasn\u2019t what people in our family, especially the ladies, did,\u201d was the way Phyllida put it. Every so often, in reflective moods, she told her daughters the story of her one great disobedience. After graduating from college, Phyllida had \u201crun away\u201d to Hollywood. Without telling her parents, she\u2019d flown out to Los Angeles, staying with a friend from Smith. She\u2019d found a job as a secretary in an insurance company. She and the friend, a girl named Sally Peyton, moved into a bungalow in Santa Monica. In six months Phyllida had three auditions, one screen test, and \u201cloads of invitations.\u201d She\u2019d once seen Jackie Gleason carrying a chihuahua into a restaurant. She\u2019d developed a lustrous suntan she described as \u201cEgyptian.\u201d Whenever Phyllida spoke about this period in her life, it seemed as if she was talking about another person. As for Alton, he became quiet, fully aware that Phyllida\u2019s loss had been his gain. It was on the train back to New York, the next Christmas, that she\u2019d met the straight-backed lieutenant colonel, recently returned from Berlin. Phyllida never went back to L.A. She got married instead. \u201cAnd had you two,\u201d she told her daughters.\n\nPhyllida\u2019s inability to realize her dreams had given Madeleine her own. Her mother\u2019s life was the great counterexample. It represented the injustice Madeleine\u2019s life would rectify. To come of age simultaneously with a great social movement, to grow up in the age of Betty Friedan and ERA marches and Bella Abzug\u2019s indomitable hats, to define your identity when it was being redefined, this was a freedom as great as any of the American freedoms Madeleine had read about in school. She could remember the night, in 1973, when her family gathered before the television in the den to watch the tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. How she, Alwyn, and Phyllida had rooted for Billie Jean, while Alton had pulled for Bobby Riggs. How, as King ran Riggs back and forth across the court, outserving him, hitting winners he was too slow to return, Alton began to grumble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a fair fight! Riggs is too old.\n\nIf they want a real test, she should play Smith or Newcombe.\u201d\n\nBut it didn\u2019t matter what Alton said.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that Bobby Riggs was fifty-five and King twenty-nine, or that Riggs hadn\u2019t been an especially great player even in his prime. What mattered was that this tennis match was on national television, during prime time, billed for weeks as \u201cThe Battle of the Sexes,\u201d and that the woman was winning. If any single moment defined Madeleine\u2019s generation of girls, dramatized their aspirations, put into clear focus what they expected from themselves and from life, it was those two hours and fifteen minutes when the country watched a man in white shorts get thrashed by a woman, pummeled repeatedly until all he could do, after match point, was to jump feebly over the net. And even that was telling: you were supposed to jump the net when you won, not lost. So how male was that, to act like a winner when you\u2019d just been creamed?\n\nAt the first meeting of Acting Workshop, Professor Churchill, a bald bullfrog of a man, asked the students to say something about themselves. Half the people in the class were theater majors, serious about acting or directing. Madeleine mumbled something about loving Shakespeare and Eugene O\u2019Neill.\n\nDabney Carlisle stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019ve done a little modeling work, down in New York. My agent suggested I should take some acting lessons. So here I am.\u201d\n\nThe modeling he\u2019d done consisted of a single magazine ad, showing a group of Leni Riefenstahl\u2013ish athletes in boxer briefs, standing in a receding line on a beach whose black volcanic sand steamed around their marble feet. Madeleine didn\u2019t see the photograph until she and Dabney were already going out, when Dabney gingerly took it out of the bartending manual where he kept it safely pressed. She was inclined to make fun of it but something reverential in Dabney\u2019s expression stopped her. And so she asked where the beach had been (Montauk) and why it was so black (it wasn\u2019t) and how much he\u2019d gotten paid (\u201cfour figures\u201d) and what the other guys were like (\u201ctotal a-holes\u201d) and if he was wearing the underpants right now. It was sometimes difficult, with boys, to take an interest in the things that interested them. But with Dabney she wished it had been curling, she longed for it to be the model UN, anything but male modeling. This, anyway, was the authentic emotion she now identified herself as having felt. At the time\u2014Dabney cautioned her against touching the ad before he got it laminated\u2014Madeleine had rehearsed in her mind the standard arguments: that though objectification was de facto bad, the emergence of the idealized male form in the mass media scored a point for equality; that if men started getting objectified and started worrying about their looks and their bodies, they might begin to understand the burden women had been living with since forever, and might therefore be sensitized to these issues of the body. She even went so far as to admire Dabney for his courage in allowing himself to be photographed in snug little gray underpants.\n\nLooking the way Madeleine and Dabney did, it was inevitable that they would be cast as romantic leads in the scenes the workshop performed. Madeleine was Rosalind to Dabney\u2019s wooden Orlando, Maggie to his brick-like Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. To rehearse the first time, they met at Dabney\u2019s fraternity house. Merely stepping through the front door reinforced Madeleine\u2019s aversion to places like Sigma Chi. It was around ten on a Sunday morning. The vestiges of the previous evening\u2019s \u201cHawaiian Night\u201d were still there to see\u2014the lei hanging from the antlers of the moose head on the wall, the plastic \u201cgrass\u201d skirt trampled on the beer-sodden floor, a skirt that, should Madeleine succumb to the outrageous good looks of Dabney Carlisle, she might, at a minimum, have to watch some drunken slut hula in to the baying of the brothers, or, at a maximum (for mai tais made you do crazy things), might even don herself, up in Dabney\u2019s room, for his pleasure alone. On the low-slung couch two Sigma Chi members were watching TV. At Madeleine\u2019s appearance, they stirred, rising out of the gloom like openmouthed carp. She hurried to the back stairs, thinking the things she always thought when it came to frats and frat guys: that their appeal stemmed from a primitive need for protection (one thought of Neanderthal clans banding together against other Neanderthal clans); that the hazing the pledges underwent (being stripped and blindfolded and left in the lobby of the Biltmore Hotel with bus fare taped to their genitals) enacted the very fears of male rape and emasculation that membership in the fraternity promised protection against; that any guy who longed to join a frat suffered from insecurities that poisoned his relationships with women; that there was something seriously wrong with homophobic guys who centered their lives around a homoerotic bond; that the stately mansions maintained by generations of dues-paying fraternity members were in reality sites for date rape and problem drinking; that frats always smelled bad; that you didn\u2019t ever want to shower in one; that only freshman girls were stupid enough to go to frat parties; that Kelly Traub had slept with a Sigma Delt guy who kept saying,\n\n\u201cNow you see it, now you don\u2019t, now you see it, now you don\u2019t\u201d; that such a thing wasn\u2019t going to happen to her, to Madeleine, ever.\n\nWhat she hadn\u2019t expected when it came to a fraternity was a sunny-haired silent type like Dabney, learning his lines in a folding chair, in parachute pants, shoeless. Looking back on their relationship, Madeleine figured she\u2019d had no choice. Dabney and she had been selected for each other in a Royal Wedding kind of way. She was Prince Charles to his Princess Di. She knew he couldn\u2019t act. Dabney had the artistic soul of a third-string tight end. In life Dabney moved and said little. Onstage he moved not at all but had to say a lot. His best dramatic moments came when the strain on his face from remembering his lines resembled the emotion he was trying to simulate.\n\nActing opposite Dabney made Madeleine more stiff and nervous than she already was. She wanted to do scenes with the talented kids in the workshop. She suggested interesting bits from The Vietnamization of New Jersey and Mamet\u2019s Sexual Perversity in Chicago, but got no takers. Nobody wanted to lower his or her average by acting with her.\n\nDabney didn\u2019t let it bother him. \u201cBunch of little shits in that class,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll never get any print work, much less movies.\u201d\n\nHe was more laconic than she liked her boyfriends to be. He had the wit of a store mannequin. But Dabney\u2019s physical perfection pushed these realities out of her mind. She\u2019d never been in a relationship where she wasn\u2019t the more attractive partner. It was slightly intimidating. But she could handle it. At three a.m., while Dabney lay sleeping beside her, Madeleine found she was up to the task of inventorying each abdominal cord, every hard lump of muscle. She enjoyed applying calipers to Dabney\u2019s waist to measure his body fat. Underwear modeling was all about the abs, Dabney said, and the abs were all about sit-ups and diet. The pleasure Madeleine got from looking at Dabney was reminiscent of the pleasure she\u2019d gotten as a girl from looking at sleek hunting dogs. Underneath this pleasure, like the coals that fed it, was a fierce need to enfold Dabney and siphon off his strength and beauty. It was all very primitive and evolutionary and felt fantastic. The problem was that she hadn\u2019t been able to allow herself to enjoy Dabney or even to exploit him a little, but had had to go and be a total girl about it and convince herself that she was in love with him. Madeleine required emotion, apparently. She disapproved of the idea of meaningless, extremely satisfying sex.\n\nAnd so she began to tell herself that Dabney\u2019s acting was \u201crestrained\u201d or \u201ceconomical.\u201d She appreciated that Dabney was \u201csecure about himself\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t need to prove anything\u201d and wasn\u2019t a \u201cshowoff.\u201d Instead of worrying that he was dull, Madeleine decided he was gentle. Instead of thinking he was poorly read, she called him intuitive. She exaggerated Dabney\u2019s mental abilities in order not to feel shallow for wanting his body. To this end she helped Dabney write\u2014O.K., she wrote\u2014English and anthro papers for him and, when he got A\u2019s, felt confirmed of his intelligence. She sent him off to modeling auditions in New York with good-luck kisses and listened to him complain bitterly about the \u201cfaggots\u201d who hadn\u2019t hired his services. It turned out that Dabney wasn\u2019t so beautiful. Among the truly beautiful he was only so-so. He couldn\u2019t even smile right.\n\nAt the end of the semester, the acting students met separately with the professor for a critical review. Churchill welcomed Madeleine with a wolfish yellow grin, then sat back jowly and deliberate in his chair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed having you in the class, Madeleine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t act.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t hold back,\u201d Madeleine said, chastened but laughing. \u201cGive it to me straight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a good feel for language, for Shakespeare especially. But your voice is reedy and you look worried onstage. Your forehead has a perpetual crease. A vocal coach could go a long way toward helping your instrument. But I worry about your worrying. You\u2019ve got it right now. The crease.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is fine.\n\nIf you\u2019re playing Eleanor Roosevelt. Or Golda Meir. But those parts don\u2019t come around very often.\u201d\n\nChurchill, steepling his fingers, continued, \u201cI\u2019d be more diplomatic if I thought this meant a lot to you. But I get the feeling you don\u2019t want to be a professional actress, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cGood. You\u2019re lovely. You\u2019re bright. The world is your oyster. Go with my blessings.\u201d\n\nWhen Dabney returned from his review with Churchill, he looked even more self-contented than usual.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Madeleine asked. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says I\u2019m perfect for soaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoap commercials?\u201d\n\nDabney looked peeved. \u201cDays of Our Lives. General Hospital. Ever heard of those?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he mean that as a compliment?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow else could he mean it? Soap actors have it made! They work every day, make great money, and never have to travel. I\u2019ve been wasting my time trying to get all this advertising work. Screw that. I\u2019m going to tell my agent to start lining up some auditions for soaps.\u201d\n\nMadeleine was silent at this news. She\u2019d assumed Dabney\u2019s enthusiasm for modeling was temporary, a tuition-earning scheme. Now she realized he was in earnest. She was, in fact, dating a model.\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Dabney asked her.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust that\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014but I doubt Prof. Churchill has that high of an opinion of the acting on Days of Our Lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he tell us the first class? He said he was giving a workshop in acting. For people who wanted to work in the theater.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the theater doesn\u2019t mean \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he tellyou? Did he say you were going to be a movie star?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told me I couldn\u2019t act,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cHe did, huh?\u201d Dabney put his hands in his pockets, leaning back on his heels as if relieved not to have to deliver this verdict himself. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re so pissed off? And have to tear down my crit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not tearing down your crit. I\u2019m just not sure you got Churchill\u2019s meaning, exactly.\u201d\n\nDabney let out a bitter laugh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get it right, would I? I\u2019m too dumb. I\u2019m just some dumb jock you have to write English papers for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. You seem to have a pretty good grasp of sarcasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, am I ever lucky,\u201d Dabney said.\n\n\u201cWhat would I do if you weren\u2019t around?\n\nYou have to catch all the subtleties for me, don\u2019t you? You and your flair for catching subtleties. It must be nice to be rich and sit around all day catching subtleties.\n\nWhat do you know about needing to make a living?\n\nIt\u2019s fine for you to make fun of my ad. You didn\u2019t get into college on a football scholarship. And now you have to come in here and run me down.\n\nYou know what? This is bullshit. This is total bullshit. I\u2019m sick of your condescension and your superiority complex. And Churchill\u2019s right. You can\u2019t act.\u201d\n\nIn the end Madeleine had to admit that Dabney was far more fluent than she\u2019d ever expected. He was capable of portraying a range of emotions, too, anger, disgust, wounded pride, and of simulating others, including affection, passion, and love. He had a great career in the soaps ahead of him.\n\n\n\nMadeleine and Dabney had broken up in May, right before summer, and there was no better time than summer to forget about somebody. She\u2019d gone straight down to Prettybrook the day she finished her last exam. For once she was glad to have such sociable parents. With all the cocktail parties and convivial dinners on Wilson Lane there was little time to dwell on herself. In July, she got an internship at a nonprofit poetry organization on the Upper East Side and began riding the train into the city. Madeleine\u2019s job was to oversee submissions for the annual New Voices award, which involved making sure that the submissions were complete before sending them off to the judge (Howard Nemerov, that year). Madeleine wasn\u2019t particularly technical, but because everyone else in the office was even less so, she ended up being the go-to person whenever the copier or the dot-matrix printer malfunctioned. Her coworker Brenda would come up to Madeleine\u2019s desk at least once a week and ask in a babyish voice,\n\n\u201cCan you help me? The printer\u2019s not being nice.\u201d The only part of the day Madeleine enjoyed was her lunch hour, when she got to walk around the muggy, stinking, thrilling streets, eat quiche in a French bistro as narrow as a bowling alley, and stare at the styles women her age or a little older were wearing. When the one straight guy at the nonprofit asked her to have a drink after work,\n\nMadeleine cooly answered, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t,\u201d trying not to feel bad about hurting his feelings, trying to think about her own feelings for a change.\n\nShe arrived back at college for her senior year, then, intent on being studious, career-oriented, and aggressively celibate. Casting a wide net, Madeleine sent away for applications to Yale grad school (English Language and Literature), an organization for teaching English in China, and an advertising internship at Foote, Cone & Belding, in Chicago. She studied for the GRE using a sample booklet. The verbal section was easy. The math required brushing up on her high school algebra. The logic problems, however, were a defeat to the spirit. \u201cAt the annual dancers\u2019 ball a number of dancers performed their favorite dance with their favorite partners. Alan danced the tango, while Becky watched the waltz. James and Charlotte were fantastic together. Keith was magnificent during his foxtrot and Simon excelled at the rumba. Jessica danced with Alan. But Laura did not dance with Simon. Can you determine who danced with whom and which dance they each enjoyed?\u201d Logic wasn\u2019t something Madeleine had been expressly taught. It seemed unfair to be asked about it. She did as the book suggested, diagramming the problems, placing Alan, Becky, James, Charlotte, Keith, Simon, Jessica, and Laura on the dance floor of her scrap paper, and pairing them according to the instructions. But their complicated transit wasn\u2019t a subject Madeleine\u2019s mind naturally followed. She wanted to know why James and Charlotte were fantastic together, and if Jessica and Alan were going out, and why Laura wouldn\u2019t dance with Simon, and if Becky was upset, watching.\n\nOne afternoon, on the bulletin board outside Hillel House, Madeleine noticed a flyer announcing the Melvin and Hetty Greenberg Fellowship for summer study at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and she applied for that. Using contacts of Alton\u2019s in the publishing world, she put on a business suit and went down to New York for an informational interview with an editor at Simon and Schuster. The editor, Terry Wirth, had once been a bright, idealistic English major just like Madeleine, but she found him that afternoon, in his tiny, manuscript-piled office looking onto the gloomy canyon of Sixth Avenue, a middle-aged father of two with a salary far below the median of his former classmates and a nasty, hour-and-fifteen-minute commute to his split-level in Montclair, New Jersey. On the prospects of a book he was publishing that month, the memoir of a migrant farmer,\n\nWirth said, \u201cNow\u2019s the calm before the calm.\u201d He gave Madeleine a stack of manuscripts from the slush pile to critique, offering to pay her fifty bucks a pop.\n\nInstead of reading the manuscripts, Madeleine took the subway down to the East Village. After buying a bag of pignoli cookies at De Robertis, she plunged into a hair salon, where, on a whim, she allowed a butch woman with a short, rat-tailed haircut to go to work on her.\n\n\u201cCut it close on the sides, higher on top,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Madeleine answered. To show her resolve, she took off her glasses. Forty-five minutes later, she put her glasses back on, horror-struck and elated at the transformation. Her head was really quite enormous. She had never fathomed its true size. She looked like Annie Lennox, or David Bowie. Like someone the hairdresser might be dating.\n\nThe Annie Lennox look was O.K., however. Androgyny was just the thing. Once she was back at school, Madeleine\u2019s haircut proclaimed her serious frame of mind, and by the end of the year, when her bangs had grown out to a maddening length she didn\u2019t know what to do with, she remained firm in her renunciations. (Her only slip-up had been the night in her bedroom with Mitchell, but nothing had happened.) Madeleine had her thesis to write. She had her future to figure out. The last thing she needed was a boy to distract her from her work and disturb her equilibrium. But then, during spring semester, she met Leonard Bankhead and her resolve went out the window.\n\nHe shaved irregularly. His Skoal had a menthol scent, cleaner, more pleasant than Madeleine expected. Whenever she looked up to find Leonard staring at her with his St. Bernard\u2019s eyes (the eyes of a drooler, maybe, but also of a loyal brute who could dig you out of an avalanche), Madeleine couldn\u2019t help staring back a significant moment longer.\n\nOne evening in early March, when she went to the Rockefeller Library to pick up the reserve reading for Semiotics 211, she found Leonard there as well. He was leaning against the counter, speaking animatedly to the girl on duty, who was unfortunately rather cute in a busty Bettie Page way.\n\n\u201cThink about it, though,\u201d Leonard was saying to the girl. \u201cThink about it from the point of view of the fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K., I\u2019m a fly,\u201d the girl said with a throaty laugh.\n\n\u201cWe move in slow motion to them. They can see the swatter coming from a million miles away. The flies are like, \u2018Wake me when the swatter gets close.\u2019\u201d\n\nNoticing Madeleine, the girl told Leonard, \u201cJust a sec.\u201d\n\nMadeleine held out her call order slip, and the girl took it and went off into the stacks.\n\n\u201cPicking up the Balzac?\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBalzac to the rescue.\u201d\n\nNormally, Madeleine would have had many things to say to this, many comments about Balzac to make. But her mind was a blank. She didn\u2019t even remember to smile until he\u2019d looked away.\n\nBettie Page came back with Madeleine\u2019s order, sliding it toward her and immediately turning back to Leonard. He seemed different than he did in class, more exuberant, supercharged. He raised his eyebrows in a crazed, Jack Nicholson way and said,\n\n\u201cMy house fly theory is related to my theory about why time seems to go faster as you get older.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d the girl asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s proportional,\u201d Leonard explained. \u201cWhen you\u2019re five, you\u2019ve only been alive a couple thousand days. But by the time you\u2019re fifty, you\u2019ve lived around twenty thousand days. So a day when you\u2019re five seems longer because it\u2019s a greater percentage of the whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d the girl teased, \u201cthat follows.\u201d\n\nBut Madeleine had understood. \u201cThat makes sense,\u201d she said. \u201cI always wondered why that was.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a theory,\u201d Leonard said.\n\nBettie Page tapped Leonard\u2019s hand to get his attention.\n\n\u201cFlies aren\u2019t always so fast,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve caught flies in my bare hands before.\u201d\n\n\u201cEspecially in winter,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably the kind of fly I\u2019d be. One of those knucklehead winter flies.\u201d\n\nThere was no good excuse for Madeleine to hang around the reserve reading room, and so she put the Balzac into her bag and headed out.\n\nShe began to dress differently on the days she had semiotics. She took out her diamond studs, leaving her ears bare. She stood in front of the mirror wondering if her Annie Hall glasses might possibly project a New Wave look. She decided not and wore her contacts. She unearthed a pair of Beatle boots she\u2019d bought at a church basement sale in Vinalhaven. She put up her collar, and wore more black.\n\nIn Week Four, Zipperstein assigned Umberto Eco\u2019s The Role of the Reader. It hadn\u2019t done much for Madeleine. She wasn\u2019t all that interested, as a reader, in the reader. She was still partial to that increasingly eclipsed entity: the writer. Madeleine had a feeling that most semiotic theorists had been unpopular as children, often bullied or overlooked, and so had directed their lingering rage onto literature. They wanted to demote the author. They wanted a book, that hard-won, transcendent thing, to be a text, contingent, indeterminate, and open for suggestions. They wanted the reader to be the main thing. Because they were readers.\n\nWhereas Madeleine was perfectly happy with the idea of genius. She wanted a book to take her places she couldn\u2019t get to herself. She thought a writer should work harder writing a book than she did reading it. When it came to letters and literature, Madeleine championed a virtue that had fallen out of esteem: namely, clarity. The week after they read Eco, they read portions of Derrida\u2019s Writing and Difference. The week after that, they read Jonathan Culler\u2019s On Deconstruction, and Madeleine came to class ready to contribute to the discussion for the first time. Before she could do so, however, Thurston beat her to it.\n\n\u201cThe Culler was passable at best,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cWhat didn\u2019t you like about it?\u201d the professor asked him.\n\nThurston had his knee up against the edge of the seminar table. He pushed his chair up on its back legs, scrunching up his face. \u201cIt\u2019s readable and everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd well argued and all that. But it\u2019s just a question of whether you can use a discredited discourse\u2014like, say, reason\u2014to explicate something as paradigmatically revolutionary as deconstruction.\u201d\n\nMadeleine searched along the table for mutual eye-rolling but the other students seemed eager to hear what Thurston had to say.\n\n\u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cWell, what I mean is, first off, reason is just a discourse like any other, right? It\u2019s only been imbued with a sense of absolute truth because it\u2019s the privileged discourse of the West. What Derrida\u2019s saying is that you have to use reason because, you know, reason is all there is. But at the same time you have to be aware that language is by its very nature unreasonable. You have to reason yourself out of reasonableness.\u201d He pulled up the sleeve of his T-shirt and scratched his bony shoulder. \u201cCuller, on the other hand, is still operating in the old mode. Mono as opposed to stereo. So from that point of view, I found the book, yeah, a little bit disappointing.\u201d\n\nA silence ensued. And deepened.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Madeleine said, glancing at Leonard for support.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just me, but wasn\u2019t it a relief to read a logical argument for once? Culler boils down everything Eco and Derrida are saying into a digestible form.\u201d\n\nThurston turned his head slowly to gaze across the seminar table at her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. But Culler\u2019s work is of a different order than Derrida. Every genius needs an explainer. That\u2019s what Culler is for Derrida.\u201d\n\nMadeleine shrugged this off. \u201cI got a lot better idea of what deconstruction is from reading Culler than from reading Derrida.\u201d\n\nThurston took pains to give her point of view full consideration. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of a simplification to be simple,\u201d he said.\n\nClass ended shortly after that, leaving Madeleine fuming. As she was coming out of Sayles Hall, she saw Leonard standing on the steps, holding a Coke can. She went right up to him and said, \u201cThanks for the help.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you were on my side. Why didn\u2019t you say anything in class?\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst Law of Thermodynamics,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cConservation of energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you agree with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did and I didn\u2019t,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t like the Culler?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Culler\u2019s good. But Derrida\u2019s a heavyweight. You can\u2019t just write him off.\u201d\n\nMadeleine looked dubious, but Derrida wasn\u2019t who she was mad at. \u201cConsidering how Thurston\u2019s always going on about how much he worships language, you\u2019d think he wouldn\u2019t parrot so much jargon. He used the word phallus three times today.\u201d\n\nLeonard smiled. \u201cFigures if he says it it\u2019ll be like having one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe drives me crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to get some coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd fascist. That\u2019s another of his favorites. You know the dry cleaners on Thayer Street? He called them fascist.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust have gone extra heavy on the starch.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYes, what?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just invited me for coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did?\u201d Leonard said. \u201cYes, I did. O.K. Let\u2019s go get coffee.\u201d\n\nLeonard didn\u2019t want to go to the Blue Room. He said he didn\u2019t like to be around college students. They headed through Wayland Arch up to Hope Street, in the direction of Fox Point.\n\nAs they walked, Leonard spat into his Coke can every so often.\n\n\u201cPardon my disgusting habit,\u201d he said.\n\nMadeleine wrinkled up her nose. \u201cAre you going to keep doing that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I do it. It\u2019s just something I picked up from my rodeo days.\u201d\n\nAt the next trash can they came to, he tossed the Coke and spat out his wad of tobacco.\n\nWithin a few blocks pretty campus plantings of tulip and daffodil gave way to treeless streets lined by working-class houses painted in cheerful hues. They passed a Portuguese bakery and a Portuguese fish store selling sardines and cuttlefish. The kids here had no yards to play in but seemed happy enough, wheeling back and forth along the blank sidewalks. Nearer the highway, there were a few warehouses and, on the corner of Wickenden, a local diner.\n\nLeonard wanted to sit at the counter. \u201cI need to be close to the pies,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to see which one is talking to me.\u201d\n\nAs Madeleine took a stool next to him, Leonard stared at the dessert case.\n\n\u201cDo you remember when they used to serve slices of cheese with apple pie?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cVaguely,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to do that anymore. You and I are probably the only two people in this place who remember it.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I don\u2019t remember it,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t? Never had a little slice of Wisconsin cheddar with your apple pie? I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll put a slice of cheese on a piece if you ask them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say I liked it. I\u2019m just mourning its passage.\u201d\n\nThe conversation lapsed. And suddenly, to her surprise, Madeleine was flooded with panic. She felt the silence like a judgment against her. At the same time, her anxiety about the silence made it even harder to speak.\n\nThough it didn\u2019t feel nice to be so nervous, it did feel nice, in a way. It had been a while since Madeleine had been that way around a guy.\n\nThe waitress was down at the end of the counter talking to another customer.\n\n\u201cSo why are you taking Zipperstein\u2019s class?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cPhilosophical interest,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cLiterally. Philosophy\u2019s all about theory of language right now. It\u2019s all linguistics. So I figured I\u2019d check it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you a biology major, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I really am,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThe philosophy\u2019s just a sideline.\u201d\n\nMadeleine realized that she\u2019d never dated a science major.\n\n\u201cDo you want to be a doctor?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now all I want to do is get the waitress\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nLeonard waved his arm a few times to no avail. Suddenly he said, \u201cIs it hot in here?\u201d\n\nWithout waiting for an answer, he reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a blue bandanna, which he proceeded to put over his head, tying it in back and making a number of small, precise adjustments until he was satisfied. Madeleine watched this with a slight feeling of disappointment. She associated bandannas with hacky sack, the Grateful Dead, and alfalfa sprouts, all of which she could do without. Still, she was impressed with Leonard\u2019s sheer size on the stool next to her. His largeness, coupled with the softness\u2014the delicacy, almost\u2014of his voice, gave Madeleine a strange fairytale feeling, as if she were a princess sitting beside a gentle giant.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, though,\u201d Leonard said, still staring in the waitress\u2019s direction,\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get interested in philosophy because of linguistics. I got interested for the eternal verities. To learn how to die, et cetera. Now it\u2019s more like, \u2018What do we mean when we say we die?\u2019\n\n\u2018What do we mean we mean when we say we die?\u2019\u201d\n\nFinally, the waitress came over. Madeleine ordered the cottage cheese plate and coffee. Leonard ordered apple pie and coffee. When the waitress left, he spun his stool rightward, so that their knees briefly touched.\n\n\u201cHow very female of you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d\n\n\u201cCottage cheese.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like cottage cheese.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you on a diet? You don\u2019t look like someone on a diet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nAnd here, for the first time, Leonard appeared rattled. Beneath the line of the bandanna, his face colored, and he spun away, breaking eye contact. \u201cJust curious,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the next second, he spun back, resuming the previous conversation. \u201cDerrida\u2019s supposed to be a lot clearer in French,\u201d he said. \u201cRumor has it his prose in French is limpid.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I should read it in French, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know French?\u201d Leonard said, sounding impressed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not great. I can read Flaubert.\u201d\n\nIt was then that Madeleine made a big mistake. Things were going so well with Leonard, the mood was so promising\u2014even the weather lending a hand because, after they finished their food and left the diner, walking back to campus, a March drizzle forced them to share Madeleine\u2019s collapsible umbrella\u2014that a feeling came over her like those she\u2019d had as a girl when treated to a pastry or a dessert, a happiness so fraught by an awareness of its brevity that she took the tiniest bites, making the cream puff or \u00e9clair last as long as possible. In this same way, instead of seeing where the afternoon led, Madeleine decided to check its progress, to save some for later, and she told Leonard she had to go home and study.\n\nThey didn\u2019t kiss goodbye. They didn\u2019t come close to it.\n\nLeonard, hunching under the umbrella, abruptly said \u201cBye\u201d and hurried off through the rain, keeping his head down. Madeleine went back to the Narragansett. She lay down on her bed, and didn\u2019t move for a long time.\n\nThe days dragged until the next meeting of Sem 211. Madeleine arrived early, choosing a seat at the seminar table next to Leonard\u2019s usual spot. But when he showed up, ten minutes late, he took an available chair next to the professor. He didn\u2019t say anything in class or glance in Madeleine\u2019s direction even once. His face looked swollen and there was a line of blemishes running down one cheek. When the class ended, Leonard was the first one out the door.\n\nThe next week he missed class entirely.\n\nAnd so Madeleine was left to contend with semiotics, and with Zipperstein and his disciples, all by herself.\n\nBy now they had moved on to Derrida\u2019s Of Grammatology. The Derrida went like this: \u201cIn that sense, it is the Aufhebung of other writings, particularly of hieroglyphic script and of the Leibnizian characteristic that had been criticized previously through one and the same gesture.\u201d In poetic moods, the Derrida went like this: \u201cWhat writing itself, in its nonphonetic moment, betrays, is life. It menaces at once the breath, the spirit, and history as the spirit\u2019s relationship with itself. It is their end, their finitude, their paralysis.\u201d\n\nSince Derrida claimed that language, by its very nature, undermined any meaning it attempted to promote, Madeleine wondered how Derrida expected her to get his meaning. Maybe he didn\u2019t. That was why he deployed so much arcane terminology, so many loop-de-looping clauses. That was why he said what he said in sentences it took a minute to identify the subjects of. (Could \u201cthe access to pluridimensionality and to a delinearized temporality\u201d really be a subject?)\n\nReading a novel after reading semiotic theory was like jogging empty-handed after jogging with hand weights. After getting out of Semiotics 211, Madeleine fled to the Rockefeller Library, down to B Level, where the stacks exuded a vivifying smell of mold, and grabbed something\u2014anything, The House of Mirth, Daniel Deronda\u2014to restore herself to sanity. How wonderful it was when one sentence followed logically from the sentence before! What exquisite guilt she felt, wickedly enjoying narrative! Madeleine felt safe with a nineteenth-century novel. There were going to be people in it. Something was going to happen to them in a place resembling the world.\n\nThen, too, there were lots of weddings in Wharton and Austen. There were all kinds of irresistible gloomy men.\n\nThe next Thursday, Madeleine came to class wearing a Norwegian sweater with a snowflake design. She\u2019d gone back to her glasses. For the second week in a row, Leonard didn\u2019t show up. Madeleine worried that he\u2019d dropped the class, but it was too late in the semester to do that. Zipperstein said,\n\n\u201cHas anybody seen Mr. Bankhead? Is he sick?\u201d Nobody knew. Thurston arrived with a girl named Cassandra Hart, both of them sniffly and heroin-pale. Taking out a black Flair pen, Thurston wrote on Cassandra\u2019s bare shoulder,\n\n\u201cNot Real Skin.\u201d\n\nZipperstein was in a lively mood. He\u2019d just returned from a conference in New York, dressed differently than usual. Listening to him talk about the paper he\u2019d given at the New School, Madeleine suddenly understood. Semiotics was the form Zipperstein\u2019s midlife crisis had taken. Becoming a semiotician allowed Zipperstein to wear a leather jacket, to fly off to Douglas Sirk retrospectives in Vancouver, and to get all the sexy waifs in his classes. Instead of leaving his wife, Zipperstein had left the English department. Instead of buying a sports car, he\u2019d bought deconstruction.\n\nHe sat at the seminar table now and started speaking:\n\n\u201cI hope you read the Semiotext(e) for this week. Apropos of Lyotard, and in homage to Gertrude Stein, let me suggest the following: the thing about desire is that there is no there there.\u201d\n\nThat was it. That was Zipperstein\u2019s prompt. He sat before them, blinking, waiting for somebody to reply. He appeared to have all the patience in the world.\n\nMadeleine had wanted to know what semiotics was. She\u2019d wanted to know what the fuss was about. Well, now she felt she knew.\n\nBut then, in Week Ten, for reasons that were entirely extracurricular, semiotics began making sense.\n\nIt was a Friday night in April, just past eleven, and Madeleine was in bed, reading. The assigned text for that week was Roland Barthes\u2019 A Lover\u2019s Discourse. For a book purportedly about love, it didn\u2019t look very romantic. The cover was a somber chocolate brown, the title turquoise. There was no author photograph and only a sketchy bio, listing Barthes\u2019 other works.\n\nMadeleine had the book in her lap. With her right hand she was eating peanut butter straight from the jar. The spoon fit perfectly against the curve of her upper palate, allowing the peanut butter to dissolve creamily against her tongue.\n\nOpening to the introduction, she began to read:\n\nThe necessity for this book is to be found in the following consideration: that the lover\u2019s discourse is today of an extreme solitude.\n\nOutside, the temperature, which had remained cold through March, had shot up into the fifties. The resulting thaw was alarming in its suddenness, drainpipes and gutters dripping, sidewalks puddling, streets flooded, a constant sound of water rushing downhill.\n\nMadeleine had her windows open on the liquid darkness. She sucked the spoon and read on:\n\nWhat we have been able to say below about waiting, anxiety, memory is no more than a modest supplement offered to the reader to be made free with, to be added to, subtracted from, and passed on to others: around the figure, the players pass the handkerchief which sometimes, by a final parenthesis, is held a second longer before handing it on. (Ideally, the book would be a cooperative: \u201cTo the United Readers and Lovers.\u201d)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only that this writing seemed beautiful to Madeleine. It wasn\u2019t only that these opening sentences of Barthes\u2019 made immediate sense. It wasn\u2019t only the relief at recognizing that here, finally, was a book she might write her final paper on. What made Madeleine sit up in bed was something closer to the reason she read books in the first place and had always loved them. Here was a sign that she wasn\u2019t alone. Here was an articulation of what she had been so far mutely feeling. In bed on a Friday night, wearing sweatpants, her hair tied back, her glasses smudged, and eating peanut butter from the jar, Madeleine was in a state of extreme solitude.\n\nIt had to do with Leonard. With how she felt about him and how she couldn\u2019t tell anyone. With how much she liked him and how little she knew about him. With how desperately she wanted to see him and how hard it was to do so.\n\nIn recent days, from her solitude, Madeleine had sent out feelers. She talked about Semiotics 211 with her roommates, mentioning Thurston, Cassandra, and Leonard. It turned out that Abby knew Leonard from her freshman year.\n\n\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d Madeleine asked.\n\n\u201cSort of intense. Really smart, but intense. He used to call me all the time. Like every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he like you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he just wanted to talk. He\u2019d keep me on the phone for an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you guys talk about?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything! His relationship. My relationship. His parents, my parents. Jimmy Carter getting attacked by that swamp rabbit, which he was obsessed about. He\u2019d go on and on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was he going out with?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome girl named Mindy. But then they broke up. That\u2019s when he really started calling me. He\u2019d call like six times a day. He was always going on about how good Mindy smelled. She had this smell that was supposedly perfectly compatible to Leonard, chemically. He was worried no girl would ever smell right to him again. I told him it was probably her moisturizer. He said no, it was her skin. It was chemically perfect. That\u2019s what he\u2019s like.\u201d She paused and gave Madeleine a searching look. \u201cWhy are you asking? Do you like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just know him from class,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to invite him for dinner?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll invite him to dinner,\u201d Abby said.\n\nThe dinner had been on Tuesday night, three days ago. Leonard had come politely bearing a gift, a set of dish towels. He\u2019d dressed up, wearing a white shirt with a skinny necktie, his long hair gathered in a masculine ponytail like a Scottish warrior. He was touchingly sincere, saying hello to Abby, handing her the wrapped gift and thanking her for the invitation.\n\nMadeleine tried not to seem overeager. At dinner, she paid attention to Brian Weeger, whose breath had a dog-food smell. A couple of times, when she looked over at Leonard, he stared back, fixedly, appearing almost upset. Later, when Madeleine was in the kitchen, rinsing dishes, Leonard came in. She turned to find him inspecting a bump on the wall.\n\n\u201cThis must be an old gas main,\u201d he said.\n\nMadeleine looked at the bump, which had been painted over many times.\n\n\u201cThey used to have gas lamps in these old places,\u201d Leonard went on.\n\n\u201cThey probably used to pump the gas up from the basement. If anybody\u2019s pilot blew out, on any floor, you\u2019d have a leak. Gas didn\u2019t have an odor back then, either. They didn\u2019t start adding methyl mercaptan until later.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood to know,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cThis place must have been a powder keg.\u201d Leonard tapped the jutting object with his fingernail, turned, and looked Madeleine meaningfully in the face.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been going to class,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s head was way up above her, but then he bent down, in a peaceful, leaf-eater motion, and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been feeling well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you sick?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m better now.\u201d\n\nIn the living room Olivia called out, \u201cWho wants some Delamain? It\u2019s yummy!\u201d\n\n\u201cI want some,\u201d Brian Weeger said. \u201cThat stuff\u2019s killer.\u201d\n\nLeonard said, \u201cWere the dish towels all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dish towels. I bought you some dish towels.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re great,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect. We\u2019ll use them! Thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have brought wine, or scotch, but that\u2019s the kind of thing my father would do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do anything your father would do?\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s face and voice remained solemn as he replied, \u201cMy father is a depressive who self-medicates with alcohol. My mother is more or less the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do they live?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re divorced. My mother still lives in Portland, where I\u2019m from. My dad\u2019s in Europe. He lives in Antwerp. Last time I heard.\u201d\n\nThis interchange was encouraging, in a way. Leonard was sharing personal information. On the other hand, the information indicated that he had a troubled relationship with his parents, who were themselves troubled, and Madeleine made a point of going out only with guys who liked their parents.\n\n\u201cWhat does your father do?\u201d Leonard asked.\n\nCaught off guard, Madeleine hesitated. \u201cHe used to work at a college,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s retired.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was he? Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the president.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s face twitched. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a small college. In New Jersey. It\u2019s called Baxter.\u201d\n\nAbby came in to get some glasses. Leonard helped her get them off the top shelf. When she was gone, he turned back to Madeleine and said, as if in pain, \u201cThere\u2019s a Fellini film playing at the Cable Car this weekend. Amarcord.\u201d\n\nMadeleine gazed encouragingly up at him. There were all kinds of outmoded, novelistic words to describe how she was feeling, words like aflutter. But she had her rules. One rule was that the guy had to ask her out, not the other way around.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s playing on Saturday,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cThis Saturday?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like Fellini?\u201d\n\nTo reply to this question did not, in Madeleine\u2019s view, compromise her rule.\n\n\u201cYou want to know something embarrassing?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a Fellini film.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should see one,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I have your number? Oh, right, I have it. It\u2019s the same as Abby\u2019s number.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want me to write it down?\u201d Madeleine asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cI have it.\u201d\n\nAnd he rose, brontosaurus-like, to his place among the treetops.\n\nFor the rest of the week, Madeleine stayed in every night, waiting for Leonard to call. When she came back from classes in the afternoon she interrogated her roommates to find out if he had called while she was out.\n\n\u201cSome guy called yesterday,\u201d Olivia said, on Thursday. \u201cWhen I was in the shower.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, I forgot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it sound like Leonard?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice. I was dripping wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for taking a message!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorree,\u201d Olivia said.\n\n\u201cGod. It was just a two-second call. He said he\u2019d call back later.\u201d\n\nAnd so now it was Friday night\u2014Friday night!\u2014and Madeleine had declined to go out with Abby and Olivia in order to stay in and wait by the phone. She was reading A Lover\u2019s Discourse and marveling at its relevance to her life.\n\n\n\nWaiting\nattente / waiting\nTumult of anxiety provoked by waiting for the loved being, subject to trivial delays (rendezvous, letters, telephone calls, returns).\n\u2026 Waiting is an enchantment: I have received orders not to move. Waiting for a telephone is thereby woven out of tiny, unavowable interdictions to infinity: I forbid myself to leave the room, to go to the toilet, even to telephone (to keep the line from being busy) \u2026\n\nShe could hear the television going in the apartment below. Madeleine\u2019s bedroom faced the State Capitol dome, brightly lit against the dark sky. The heat, which they couldn\u2019t control, was still on, the radiator wastefully knocking and hissing.\n\nThe more she thought about it, the more Madeleine understood that extreme solitude didn\u2019t just describe the way she was feeling about Leonard. It explained how she\u2019d always felt when she was in love. It explained what love was like and, just maybe, what was wrong with it.\n\nThe telephone rang.\n\nMadeleine sat up in bed. She dog-eared the page she was reading. She waited as long as she could (three rings) before answering.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaddy?\u201d\n\nIt was Alton, calling from Prettybrook.\n\n\u201cOh. Hi, Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t sound so excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m studying.\u201d\n\nIn his usual way, without niceties, he got to the matter at hand. \u201cYour mother and I were just discussing graduation plans.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, Madeleine thought Alton meant that they were discussing her future. But then she realized it was just logistics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s April,\u201d she said. \u201cGraduation\u2019s not until June.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy experience with college towns is that the hotels get booked up months in advance. So we have to decide what we\u2019re doing. Now, here are the options. Are you listening?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Madeleine said, and began, at that instant, to tune out. She stuck the spoon back into the peanut butter jar and brought it to her mouth, this time just licking it.\n\nIn the phone Alton\u2019s voice was saying,\n\n\u201cOption one: Your mother and I come up the night before the ceremony, stay in a hotel, and we see you for dinner the night of graduation. Option two: We come up the morning of the ceremony, have breakfast with you, and then leave after the ceremony. Both proposals are acceptable to us. It\u2019s your choice. But let me explain the pros and cons of each scenario.\u201d\n\nMadeleine was about to answer when Phyllida spoke up on another extension.\n\n\u201cHi, dear. I hope we didn\u2019t wake you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t wake her,\u201d Alton barked. \u201cEleven o\u2019clock\u2019s not late at college. Especially on a Friday night. Hey, what are you doing in on a Friday night? Got a pimple?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Mummy,\u201d Madeleine said, ignoring him.\n\n\u201cMaddy, sweetie, we\u2019re redoing your bedroom and I wanted to ask you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re redoing my bedroom?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it needs freshening up. I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy room?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I was thinking about recarpeting it in green. You know, a good green.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Madeleine cried.\n\n\u201cMaddy, we\u2019ve kept your room the way it is for four years now\u2014you\u2019d think it was a shrine! I\u2019d like to be able to use it as a guest room, occasionally, because of the en suite bathroom. You can still have it when you come home, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll always be your room.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about my wallpaper?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s old. It\u2019s peeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change my wallpaper!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, all right. I\u2019ll leave the wallpaper alone. But the carpet\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Alton said in a peremptory tone. \u201cThis call is about graduation. Phyl, you\u2019re hijacking my agenda. You two sort out the redecorating some other time. Now, Maddy, let me go over the pros and cons. When your cousin graduated from Williams, we all had dinner after the ceremony. And, if you\u2019ll remember, Doats complained the whole time that he was missing all the parties\u2014and he left halfway through the meal. Now, your mother and I are willing to stay the night\u2014or two nights\u2014if we\u2019re going to see you. But if you\u2019re going to be busy, maybe the breakfast option makes more sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cGraduation\u2019s two months away. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I told your father,\u201d Phyllida said.\n\nIt occurred to Madeleine that she was tying up the line.\n\n\u201cLet me think about it,\u201d she said abruptly. \u201cI have to go. I\u2019m studying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to stay the night,\u201d Alton repeated, \u201cI\u2019d like to make reservations soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall me later. Let me think about it. Call me Sunday.\u201d\n\nAlton was still speaking when she hung up, so when the phone rang again, twenty seconds later,\n\nMadeleine picked up and said,\n\n\u201cDaddy, stop it. We don\u2019t have to decide tonight.\u201d\n\nThere was silence on the line. And then a male voice said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to call me Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, God. Leonard? Sorry! I thought you were my father. He\u2019s freaking out about graduation plans already.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just having a little freak-out myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout calling you.\u201d\n\nThis was good. Madeleine ran a finger along her lower lip. She said, \u201cHave you calmed down or do you want to call back later?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m resting comfortably now, thank you.\u201d\n\nMadeleine waited for more. None came. \u201cAre you calling for a reason?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYes. That Fellini film? I was hoping you might, if you\u2019re not too, I know it\u2019s bad manners calling so late, but I was at the lab.\u201d\n\nLeonard did sound a little nervous. That wasn\u2019t good. Madeleine didn\u2019t like nervous guys. Nervous guys were nervous for a reason. Up until now Leonard had seemed more the tortured type than the nervous type. Tortured was better.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that was a complete sentence,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat did I leave out?\u201d Leonard asked.\n\n\u201cHow about, \u2018Would you like to come with me?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be happy to,\u201d Leonard said.\n\nMadeleine frowned into the receiver. She had a feeling that Leonard had set up this exchange, like a chess player thinking eight moves ahead. She was going to complain when Leonard said, \u201cSorry. Not funny.\u201d He comically cleared his throat. \u201cListen, would you like to go to the movies with me?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer right away. He deserved a little punishment. And so she put the screws to him\u2014for another three seconds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d\n\nAnd there it was already, that word. She wondered if Leonard had noticed. She wondered what it meant that she had noticed. It was just a word, after all. A way of speaking.\n\nThe next night, Saturday, the fickle weather turned cold again. Madeleine was chilled in her brown suede jacket as she walked to the restaurant where they\u2019d agreed to meet. Afterward, they made their way to the Cable Car and found a sagging couch among the other mismatched sofas and armchairs that furnished the art-house cinema.\n\nShe had a hard time following the movie. The narrative cues weren\u2019t as crisp as those of Hollywood, and the film had a dream-like quality, lush but discontinuous. The audience, being a college audience, laughed knowingly during the risqu\u00e9 European moments: when the huge-titted woman stuffed her huge tit into the young hero\u2019s mouth; or when the old man up in the tree cried out, \u201cI want a woman!\u201d Fellini\u2019s theme appeared to be the same as Roland Barthes\u2019\u2014love\u2014but here it was Italian and all about the body instead of French and all about the mind. She wondered if Leonard had known what Amarcord was going to be about. She wondered if it was his way of getting her in the mood. As it so happened, she was in the mood, but no thanks to the movie. The movie was pretty to look at but confused her and made her feel na\u00efve and suburban. It seemed both overly indulgent and overly male.\n\nAfter it was over, they made their way out onto South Main. They had no stated destination. Madeleine was pleased to realize that Leonard, though tall, wasn\u2019t too tall. If she wore heels, the top of her head came up higher than his shoulders, almost to his chin.\n\n\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell, at least now I know what Felliniesque is.\u201d\n\nThe downtown skyline was on their left, across the river, the spire of the Superman building visible against the unnaturally pink city sky. The streets were empty except for other people leaving the cinema.\n\n\u201cMy goal in life is to become an adjective,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cPeople would go around saying, \u2018That was so Bankheadian.\u2019 Or, \u2018A little too Bankheadian for my taste.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBankheadian has a ring,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than Bankheadesque.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr Bankheadish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsh is terrible all around. There\u2019s Joycean, Shakespearean, Faulknerian. But ish? Who is there who\u2019s an ish?\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas Mannish?\u201d\n\n\u201cKafkaesque,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cPynchonesque! See, Pynchon\u2019s already an adjective. Gaddis. What would Gaddis be? Gaddisesque? Gaddisy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really do it with Gaddis,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cTough luck for Gaddis. Do you like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI read a little of The Recognitions,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nThey turned up Planet Street, climbing the slope.\n\n\u201cBellovian,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cIt\u2019s extra nice when they change the spelling slightly. Nabokovian already has the v. So does Chekhovian. The Russians have it made. Tolstoyan! That guy was an adjective waiting to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget Tolstoyanism,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cMy God!\u201d Leonard said. \u201cA noun! I\u2019ve never even dreamed of being a noun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would Bankheadian mean?\u201d\n\nLeonard thought for a second. \u201c\u2018Of or related to Leonard Bankhead (American, born 1959), characterized by excessive introspection or worry. Gloomy, depressive. See basket case.\u2019\u201d\n\nMadeleine was laughing. Leonard stopped walking and took hold of her arm, looking at her seriously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking you to my place,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this time we\u2019ve been walking? I\u2019ve been leading you back to my place. This is how I do it, apparently. It\u2019s shameful. Shameful. I don\u2019t want it to be like that. Not with you. So I\u2019m telling you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI figured we were going back to your place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going to call you on it. When we got closer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already close.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t come up.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Not tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cHannaesque,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cStubborn. Given to ironclad positions.\u201d\n\n\u201cHannarian,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cDangerous. Not to be messed with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stand warned.\u201d\n\nThey stood looking at each other on cold, dark Planet Street. Leonard took his hands out of his pockets to tuck his long hair behind his ears.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll come up just for a minute,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpecial Days\u201d\nf\u00eate / festivity\nThe amorous subject experiences every meeting\nwith the loved being as a festival.\n1. The Festivity is what is waited for, what is expected. What I expect of the promised presence is an unheard-of totality of pleasures, a banquet; I rejoice like the child laughing at the sight of the mother whose mere presence heralds and signifies a plenitude of satisfactions: I am about to have before me, and for myself, the \u201csource of all good things.\u201d\n\u201cI am living through days as happy as those God keeps for his chosen people; and whatever becomes of me, I can never say that I have not tasted the purest joys of life.\u201d\n\nIt was debatable whether or not Madeleine had fallen in love with Leonard the first moment she\u2019d seen him. She hadn\u2019t even known him then, and so what she\u2019d felt was only sexual attraction, not love. Even after they\u2019d gone out for coffee, she couldn\u2019t say that what she was feeling was anything more than infatuation. But ever since the night when they went back to Leonard\u2019s place after watching Amarcordand started fooling around, when Madeleine found that instead of being turned off by physical stuff, the way she often was with boys, instead of putting up with that or trying to overlook it, she\u2019d spent the entire night worrying that she was turning Leonard off, worrying that her body wasn\u2019t good enough, or that her breath was bad from the Caesar salad she\u2019d unwisely ordered at dinner; worrying, too, about having suggested they order martinis because of the way Leonard had sarcastically said,\n\n\u201cSure. Martinis. We can pretend we\u2019re Salinger characters\u201d; after having had, as a consequence of all this anxiety, pretty much no sexual pleasure, despite the perfectly respectable session they\u2019d put together; and after Leonard (like every guy) had immediately fallen asleep, leaving her to lie awake stroking his head and vaguely hoping she didn\u2019t get a urinary tract infection, Madeleine asked herself if the fact that she\u2019d just spent the whole night worrying wasn\u2019t, in fact, a surefire sign that she was falling in love. And certainly after they\u2019d spent the next three days at Leonard\u2019s place having sex and eating pizza, after she\u2019d relaxed enough to be able to come at least once in a while and finally to stop worrying so much about having an orgasm because her hunger for Leonard was in some way satisfied by his satisfaction, after she\u2019d allowed herself to sit naked on his gross couch and to walk to the bathroom knowing he was staring at her (imperfect) ass, to root for food in his disgusting refrigerator, to read the brilliant half-page of philosophy paper sticking up out of his typewriter, and to hear him pee with taurine force into the toilet bowl, certainly, by the end of those three days, Madeleine knew she was in love.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t mean she had to tell anyone. Especially Leonard.\n\nLeonard Bankhead had a studio apartment on the third floor of a low-rent student building. The halls were full of bikes and junk mail. Stickers decorated the other tenants\u2019 doors: a fluorescent marijuana leaf, a silk-screen Blondie. Leonard\u2019s door, however, was as blank as the apartment inside. In the middle of the room, a twin mattress lay beside a plastic milk crate supporting a reading lamp. There was no desk, no bookcase, not even a table, only the nasty couch, with a typewriter on another milk crate in front of it. There was nothing on the walls but bits of masking tape and, in one corner, a small portrait of Leonard, done in pencil. The drawing showed Leonard as George Washington, wearing a tricorne hat and sheltering under a blanket at Valley Forge. The caption read:\n\n\u201cYou go. I like it here.\u201d\n\nMadeleine thought the handwriting looked feminine.\n\nA ficus tree endured in the corner. Leonard moved it into the sun whenever he remembered to. Madeleine, taking pity on the tree, began to water it, until she caught Leonard looking at her one day, his eyes narrowed with suspicion.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on. What?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re watering my tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe soil\u2019s dry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking care of my tree.\u201d\n\nShe stopped doing it after that.\n\nThere was a tiny kitchen where Leonard brewed and reheated the gallon of coffee he drank every day. A big greasy wok sat on the stove. The most Leonard did in the way of preparing a meal, however, was to pour Grape Nuts into the wok. With raisins. Raisins satisfied his fruit requirement.\n\nThe apartment had a message. The message said: I am an orphan. Abby and Olivia asked Madeleine what she and Leonard did together and she never had an answer. They didn\u2019t do<!--?i--> anything. She came to his apartment and they lay down on the mattress and Leonard asked her how she was doing, really wanting to know.\n\nWhat did they do? She talked; he listened; then he talked and she listened. She\u2019d never met anyone, and certainly not a guy, who was so receptive, who took everything in. She guessed that Leonard\u2019s shrink-like manner came from years of seeing shrinks himself, and though another of her rules was to never date guys who went to shrinks, Madeleine began to reconsider this prohibition. Back home, she and her sister had a phrase for serious emotional talks. They called it \u201chaving a heavy.\u201d If a boy approached during one, the girls would look up and give warning:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a heavy.\u201d And the boy would retreat. Until it was over. Until the heavy had passed.\n\nGoing out with Leonard was like having a heavy all the time. Whenever she was with him, Leonard gave her his full attention. He didn\u2019t stare into her eyes or smother her the way Billy had, but he made it clear he was available. He offered little advice. Only listened, and murmured, reassuringly.\n\nPeople often fell in love with their shrinks, didn\u2019t they? That was called transference and was to be avoided. But what if you were already sleeping with your shrink? What if your shrink\u2019s couch was already a bed?\n\nAnd plus it wasn\u2019t all heavy, the heavies. Leonard was funny. He told hilarious stories in a deadpan voice. His head sank into his shoulders, his eyes filled with rue, as his sentences drawled on. \u201cDid I ever tell you I play an instrument? The summer my parents got divorced, they sent me to live with my grandparents in Buffalo. The people next door were Latvian, the Bruverises. And they both played the kokle.\n\nDo you know what a kokle is?\n\nIt\u2019s sort of like a zither, but Latvian.\n\n\u201cAnyway, I used to hear Mr. and Mrs. Bruveris playing their kokles over in the next yard. It was an amazing sound. Sort of wild and over-stimulated on the one hand, but melancholy on the other. The kokle is the manic-depressive of the string family. Anyway, I was bored to death that summer. I was sixteen. Six foot one. One hundred and thirty-eight pounds. A major reefer smoker. I used to get high in my bedroom and blow the smoke out the window, and then I\u2019d go out to the porch and listen to the Bruverises playing next door. Sometimes other people came over. Other kokle players. They set up lawn chairs in the backyard and they\u2019d all sit there playing together. It was an orchestra! A kokle orchestra. Then one day they saw me watching and invited me over. They gave me potato salad and a grape Popsicle and I asked Mr. Bruveris how you played a kokle and he started giving me lessons. I used to go over there every day. They had an old kokle they let me borrow. I used to practice five, six hours a day. I was into it.\n\n\u201cAt the end of that summer, when I had to leave, the Bruverises gave me the kokle. To keep. I took it on the plane with me. I got a separate seat for it, like I was Rostropovich. My father had moved out of the house by then. So it was just me, my sister, and my mother. And I kept on practicing. I got good enough that I joined this band. We used to play at ethnic festivals and Orthodox weddings. We had these traditional costumes, embroidered vests, puffy sleeves, knee-high boots. Me and all the adults. Most of them were Latvian, some Russians, too. Our big number was \u2018Otchi Tchornyia.\u2019 That\u2019s the only thing that saved me in high school. The kokle.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you still play?\u201d\n\n\u201cHell no. Are you kidding? The kokle?\u201d\n\nListening to Leonard, Madeleine felt impoverished by her happy childhood. She never wondered why she acted the way she did, or what effect her parents had had on her personality. Being fortunate had dulled her powers of observation. Whereas Leonard noticed every little thing. For instance, they spent a weekend on Cape Cod (partly to visit Pilgrim Lake Laboratory, where Leonard was applying for a research fellowship), and as they were driving back, Leonard said, \u201cWhat do you do? Just hold it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just hold it. For two days. Until you get back home.\u201d\n\nAs his meaning seeped in, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have never, ever, taken a dump in my presence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn your presence?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I am present. Or nearby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it? Nothing. If you\u2019re talking about I-sleep-over-and-go-off-to-class-the-next-morning and then you go and take a dump, that\u2019s understandable. But when we spend two, almost three days together, eating surf and turf, and you do not take a dump the entire time, I can only conclude that you are more than a little anal.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what? It\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cO.K.? I find it embarrassing.\u201d\n\nLeonard stared at her without expression and said, \u201cDo you mind when I take a dump?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have to talk about this? It\u2019s sort of gross.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we do need to talk about it. Because you\u2019re obviously not very relaxed around me, and I am\u2014or thought I was\u2014your boyfriend, and that means\u2014or should mean\u2014that I\u2019m the person you\u2019re most relaxed around. Leonard equals maximum relaxation.\u201d\n\nGuys weren\u2019t supposed to be the talkers. Guys weren\u2019t supposed to get you to open up. But this guy was; this guy did. He\u2019d said he was her \u201cboyfriend,\u201d too. He\u2019d made it official.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to be more relaxed,\u201d Madeleine said, \u201cif it\u2019ll make you happy. But in terms of\u2014excretion\u2014don\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t for me,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThis is for Mr. Lower Intestine. This is for Mr. Duodenum.\u201d\n\nEven though this kind of amateur therapy didn\u2019t exactly work (after that last conversation, for instance, Madeleine had more, not less, trouble going Number 2 if Leonard was within a mile), it affected Madeleine deeply. Leonard was examining her closely. She felt handled in the right way, like something precious or immensely fascinating. It made her happy to think about how much he thought about her.\n\nBy the end of April, Madeleine and Leonard had gotten into a routine of spending every night together. On weeknights, after Madeleine finished studying, she headed over to the biology lab, where she\u2019d find Leonard staring at slides with two Chinese grad students. After she finally got Leonard to leave the lab, Madeleine then had to cajole him into sleeping at her place. At first, Leonard had liked staying at the Narragansett. He liked the ornate moldings and the view from her bedroom. He charmed Olivia and Abby by making pancakes on Sunday mornings. But soon Leonard began to complain that they always stayed at Madeleine\u2019s place and that he never got to wake up in his own bed. Staying at Leonard\u2019s place, however, required Madeleine to bring a fresh set of clothes each night, and since he didn\u2019t like her to leave clothes at his place (and, to be honest, she didn\u2019t like to, either, because whatever she left picked up a fusty smell), Madeleine had to carry her dirty clothes around to classes all day. She preferred sleeping at her own apartment, where she could use her own shampoo, conditioner, and loofah, and where it was \u201cclean-sheet day\u201d every Wednesday. Leonard never changed his sheets. They were a disturbing gray color. Dust balls clung to the edges of the mattress. One morning, Madeleine was horrified to see a calligraphic smear of blood that had leaked from her three weeks earlier, a stain she\u2019d attacked with a kitchen sponge while Leonard was sleeping.\n\n\u201cYou never wash your sheets!\u201d she complained.\n\n\u201cI wash them,\u201d Leonard said evenly.\n\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they get dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot everyone can drop off their laundry at the cleaners every week. Not everybody grew up with \u2018clean-sheet day.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to drop them off,\u201d Madeleine said, undeterred. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a washer in the basement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI use the washer,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cJust not every Wednesday. I don\u2019t equate dirt with death and decay.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, and I do? I\u2019m obsessed with death because I wash my sheets?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s attitudes to cleanliness have a lot to do with their fear of death.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about death, Leonard. This is about crumbs in the bed. This is about the fact that your pillow smells like a liverwurst sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does!\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmell it, Leonard!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s salami. I don\u2019t like liverwurst.\u201d\n\nTo a certain extent, this kind of arguing was fun. But then came nights when Madeleine forgot to pack a change of clothes and Leonard accused her of doing this on purpose in order to force him to sleep at her place. Next, more worryingly, came nights when Leonard said he was going home to study and would see her tomorrow. He began pulling all-nighters. One of his philosophy professors offered Leonard the use of his cabin in the Berkshires and, for an entire rainy weekend, Leonard went there, alone, to write a paper on Fichte, returning with a typescript 123 pages long and wearing a bright orange hunter\u2019s vest. The vest became his favorite item of clothing. He wore it all the time.\n\nHe started finishing Madeleine\u2019s sentences. As if her mind was too slow. As if he couldn\u2019t wait for her to gather her thoughts. He riffed on the things she said, going off on strange tangents, making puns. Whenever she told him he needed to get some sleep, he got angry and didn\u2019t call her for days. And it was during this period that Madeleine fully understood how the lover\u2019s discourse was of an extreme solitude. The solitude was extreme because it wasn\u2019t physical. It was extreme because you felt it while in the company of the person you loved. It was extreme because it was in your head, that most solitary of places.\n\nThe more Leonard pulled away, the more anxious Madeleine became. The more desperate she became, the more Leonard pulled away. She told herself to act cool. She went to the library to work on her marriage-plot thesis, but the sex-fantasy atmosphere\u2014the reading-room eye contact, the beckoning stacks\u2014made her desperate to see Leonard. And so against her will her feet began leading her back across campus through the darkness to the biology department. Up to the last moment, Madeleine had the crazy hope that this expression of weakness might in fact be strength. It was a brilliant strategy because it lacked all strategy. It involved no games, only sincerity. Seeing such sincerity, how could Leonard fail to respond? She was almost happy as she came up behind the lab table and tapped Leonard on the shoulder, and her happiness lasted until he turned around with a look not of love but of annoyance.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that it was spring. Every day, people seemed more and more unclothed. The magnolia trees, budding on the green, looked positively enflamed. They sent out a perfume that drifted through the windows of Semiotics 211. The magnolia trees hadn\u2019t read Roland Barthes. They didn\u2019t think love was a mental state; the magnolias insisted it was natural, perennial.\n\nOn a beautiful warm May day, Madeleine showered, shaved her legs with extra care, and put on her first spring dress: an apple-green baby-doll dress with a bib collar and a high hem. With this, she wore Buster Browns, cream and rust, and went sockless. Her bare legs, toned from a winter of squash-playing, were pale but smooth. She kept her glasses on, left her hair loose, and walked over to Leonard\u2019s apartment on Planet Street. On the way, she stopped at a market to buy a hunk of cheese, some Stoned Wheat Thins, and a bottle of Valpolicella. Coming down the hill from Benefit toward South Main, she felt the warm breeze between her thighs. The front door of Leonard\u2019s building was propped open with a brick, so she went up to his apartment and knocked. Leonard opened the door. He looked like he\u2019d been napping.\n\n\u201cNiiiiice dress,\u201d he said.\n\nThey never made it to the park. They picnicked on each other. As Leonard pulled her toward the mattress, Madeleine dropped her packages, hoping the wine bottle didn\u2019t break. She slipped her dress over her head. Soon they were naked, raiding, it felt like, a huge basket of goodies. Madeleine lay on her stomach, her side, her back, nibbling all the treats, the nice-smelling fruit candies, the meaty drumsticks, as well as more sophisticated offerings, the biscotti flavored with anise, the wrinkly truffles, the salty spoonfuls of olive tapenade. She\u2019d never been so busy in her life. At the same time, she felt strangely displaced, not quite her usual tidy ego but merged with Leonard into a great big protoplasmic, ecstatic thing. She thought she\u2019d been in love before. She knew she\u2019d had sex before. But all those torrid adolescent gropings, all those awkward backseat romps, the meaningful, performative summer nights with her high school boyfriend Jim McManus, even the tender sessions with Billy where he insisted they look into each other\u2019s eyes as they came\u2014none of that prepared her for the wallop, the all-consuming pleasure, of this.\n\nLeonard was kissing her. When she could bear no more, Madeleine grabbed him savagely by his ears. She pulled Leonard\u2019s head away and held it still to show him the evidence of how she felt (she was crying now). In a hoarse voice edged with something else, a sense of peril, Madeleine said, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nLeonard stared back at her. His eyebrows twitched. Suddenly, he rolled sideways off the mattress. He stood up and walked, naked, across the room. Crouching, he reached into her bag and pulled out A Lover\u2019s Discourse, from the pocket where she always kept it. He flipped the pages until he found the one he wanted. Then he returned to the bed and handed the book to her.\n\nI Love You\nje-t\u2019aime / I-love-you\n\nAs she read these words, Madeleine was flooded with happiness. She glanced up at Leonard, smiling. With his finger he motioned for her to keep going. The figure refers not to the declaration of love, to the avowal, but to the repeated utterance of the love cry.<!--?i--> Suddenly Madeleine\u2019s happiness diminished, usurped by the feeling of peril. She wished she weren\u2019t naked. She narrowed her shoulders and covered herself with the bedsheet as she obediently read on.\n\nOnce the first avowal has been made, \u201cI love you\" has no meaning whatever \u2026\n\nLeonard, squatting, had a smirk on his face.\n\nIt was then that Madeleine threw the book at his head.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/300505", "artist_names": "The Blood

least I thought I knew\nAt that time it was difficult for me to distinguish\nBetween kind gestures and blatant come-ons\nI was in a bad place and my ability to interpret signals was completely off\nKind of like crossing the street and not being able to tell the difference\nBetween a red light and a green light\nAll I knew was that I had to move and so I moved forward\nJaywalking through life\nPeople like whizzing cars, speeding by\nThere were hard edges in the air, steel\nAnd the only certainty was the inevitable collision\nI was the victim\nBut, it was clear i was a willing victim\nShe invited me over for dinner\nAnd I said yes\n\u201ccome on over for dinner tonight\u201d\n\nEverywhere I went I was an alien\nI stopped for a bottle of wine at the supermarket\nIt was full of hot mothers and screaming babies\nI didn\u2019t mind, but I felt like everyone was staring at me\nTrue, I had had a couple of beers beforehand to take the edge off\nAnd I was buying a 2 euro liter of wine to ease me through dinner\nSo what?\nI was wearing sunglasses, a white button down shirt and tight black jeans\nHow did that make me persona non grata at the supermarket?\nWas it the number of cheese samples I had tried?\nThe eighth of strudel?\nThe tenth of backwurst?\n\n\u201ccome on over for dinner tonight\u201d\n\nNeedless to say I wasn\u2019t even hungry anymore\nThe beer had filled me up and now I was a few blocks from her house\nAt a cafe, drinking a glass of white wine\nIt was hot outside, but the inside of the cafe was shady and cool\nAnd the waitress was attractive\nI looked at her, she smiled at me\nI wondered what it would be like to kiss her\nThe walls of the cafe were mirrored and the person I saw in them disturbed me\nHair a mess, an emotional wreck\nCars sped by outside, there was incessant honking as an ambulance wailed\nI covered my ears and went to the bathroom\nSplashed water on my face\nPushed my hair back\nI said\n\u201cyou can do this\u201d\n\u201cyou can do this\u201d\nWhat exactly I was doing I didn\u2019t know\nGoing to dinner?\nYou might also like\u201ccome on over for dinner tonight\u201d\n\nMy confidence was flagging as the sun was setting\nI took a taxi to her place to ensure my arrival\nIt was slow, languid\nAnd as I sat in the back, taking in the city with a buzzing in my head\n\nI looked at the buildings, so different from what i knew\nPeople on bicycles, men pushing strollers, women going to work, joggers\nI couldn\u2019t tell if i was excited or terrified\nBut something was happening and I determined to see it through no matter what\n\nShe lived in a huge apartment complex, on the fourth floor\nIt was difficult to navigate, but I knew the way\nI took the stairs\nThe city was old, destroyed, divided\nBut the building she lived in was new\nI rang the doorbell\nShe was a strong and independent woman\nSo I rang it again\n\nWe drank whiskey for a while\nAnd when I left I couldn\u2019t tell if I was walking on sunshine or eggshells\nAnd still\nIt\u2019s difficult to distinguish between the twoEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 123, "api_path": "/songs/367938", "artist_names": "Sports Genius Basketball",

Tell Santa.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWait a minute. Let me see if he\u2019s still in that tub.\u201d Mrs. Reilly listened apprehensively to the great liquid thrashings coming from the bathroom. One whalelike snort floated out into the hall through the peeling bathroom door. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. He\u2019s still in there. I can\u2019t lie to you, Santa. My heart\u2019s broke.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAw.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIgnatius comes home about a hour ago dressed up like a butcher.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGood. He\u2019s got him another job, that big fat bum.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cBut not in a butcher shop, honey,\u201d Mrs. Reilly said, her voice heavy with grief. \u201cHe\u2019s a hot dog vendor.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAw, come on,\u201d Santa croaked. \u201cA hot dog vendor? You mean out on the streets?\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOut on the streets, honey, like a bum.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cBum is right, girl. Even worst. Read the police notices in the paper sometimes. They all a bunch of vagrants.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAin\u2019t that awful!\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSomebody oughta punch that boy in the nose.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhen he first comes in, Santa, he makes me guess what kinda job he\u2019s got. First, I guess, \u2018butcher,\u2019 you know?\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSo he says, very insolent, \u2018Guess again. You ain\u2019t even close.\u2019 I keep guessing for about five minutes until I can\u2019t think of no more jobs where you\u2019d be wearing one of them white uniforms. Then he finally says, \u2018Wrong every time. I got me a job selling weenies.\u2019 I almost passed out, Santa, right on the kitchen floor. Wouldn\u2019t thata been fine, me with my head broke open on the linoleum?\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t care, not that one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNot him.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNever in a million years.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe don\u2019t care about his poor momma,\u201d Mrs. Reilly said. \u201cWith all his education, mind you. Selling weenies out on the street in the broad daylight.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSo what you told him, girl?\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him nothing. By the time I got my mouth open, he runs off to the bathroom. He\u2019s still locked up in there splashing water all over the floor.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHold on a minute, Irene. I got one of my little grandchirren over here for the day,\u201d Santa said and screamed at someone at her end of the line: \u201cGet the hell away from that stove, Charmaine, and go play out on the banquette before I bust you right in the mouth.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A child\u2019s voice made some reply.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cLord,\u201d Santa continued calmly to Mrs. Reilly. \u201cThem kids is sweet, but sometimes I just don\u2019t know. Charmaine! Get the hell outside and go play on your bike before I come slap your face off. Hold the line, Irene.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mrs. Reilly heard Santa put the telephone down. Then a child screamed, a door slammed, and Santa was back on the line.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cChrist, I tell you true, Irene, that child won\u2019t listen to nobody! I\u2019m trying to cook her some spaghettis and daube, and she keeps on playing in my pot. I wish them sisters at her school would beat up on her a little. You know Angelo. You shoulda seen how them sisters beat up on him when he was a kid. One sister throwed him right into a blackboard. That\u2019s how come Angelo\u2019s such a sweet, considerate man today.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe sisters loved Ignatius. He was such a darling child. He used to win all them little holy pictures for knowing his catechism.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThem sisters shoulda knocked his head in.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhen he useta come home with all them little holy pictures,\u201d Mrs. Reilly sniffed, \u201cI sure never thought then he\u2019d end up selling weenies in the broad daylight.\u201d Mrs. Reilly coughed nervously and violently into the telephone. \u201cBut tell me, sweetheart, how Angelo\u2019s making out?\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHis wife Rita rings me up a little while ago to tell me she thinks he\u2019s coming down with pneumonia from being stuck in that toilet all the time. I tell you true, Irene, that Angelo\u2019s getting as pale as a ghost. The cops sure don\u2019t treat that boy right. He loves the force. When he graduated from the cops\u2019 academy, you would a thought he just made it outta the Ivory League. He was sure proud.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYeah, poor Angelo looks bad,\u201d Mrs. Reilly agreed. \u201cHe\u2019s got him a bad cough, that boy. Well, maybe he\u2019ll feel a little better after he reads that thing Ignatius give me to give him. Ignatius says it\u2019s inspirational literature.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYeah? I wouldn\u2019t trust no \u2018inspirational literature\u2019 I got from that Ignatius. It\u2019s prolly fulla dirty stories.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSuppose somebody I know sees him with one of them wagons.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed, babe. It ain\u2019t your fault you got a brat on your hands,\u201d Santa grunted. \u201cWhat you need is a man in that house, girl, to set that boy straight. I\u2019m gonna find that nice old man ast about you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want a nice old man. All I want is a nice child.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t you worry. Just leave it to Santa. I\u2019ll fix you up. The man runs the fish market says he don\u2019t know the man\u2019s name. But I\u2019ll find out. As a matter of fact, I think I seen him walking down St. Ferdinand Street the other day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe ast about me?\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWell, Irene, I mean I didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to him. I don\u2019t even know if it was the same man.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou see that? That old man don\u2019t care neither.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that, girl. I\u2019ll ask over by the beer parlor. I\u2019ll hang around Sunday mass. I\u2019ll find out his name.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThat old man don\u2019t care for me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIrene, they\u2019s no harm in meeting him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI got enough problems with Ignatius. It\u2019s the disgrace, Santa. Suppose Miss Annie, the next door lady, sees him with one of them wagons. She\u2019s awready about to get US put under a peace bond. She\u2019s all the time spying in that alley behind her shutters.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t worry about people, Irene,\u201d Santa advised. \u201cThe people on my block got dirty mouths. If you can live down here in St. Ode of Cluny Parish, you can live anyplace. Vicious is the word, believe me. I got one woman on my block\u2019s gonna get a brick right in her face if she don\u2019t shut up about me. Somebody told me she\u2019s been calling me a \u2018merry widow.\u2019 But don\u2019t you worry. I\u2019m gonna get her good. I think she\u2019s running with some man works at the shipyards, anyways. I think I\u2019m gonna write her husband a little anonymous letter to straighten out that girl.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI know what it is, sugar. Remember I lived down there on Dauphine when I was a girl. The anonymous letters my poppa useta get... about me. Vicious. I always thought my cousin, that poor spinster girl, was writing them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhich cousin was that?\u201d Santa asked with interest. Irene Reilly\u2019s relatives always had gory biographies that were worth hearing.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThat was the one knocked a pot of berling water on her arm when she was a child. She was kinda scalded looking. You know what I mean! I always seen her writing away at the kitchen table at her momma\u2019s house. She was prolly writing about me. She was very jealous when Mr. Reilly started seeing me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s the way it goes,\u201d Santa said. A scalded relative was a dull figure in Irene\u2019s dramatic gallery. Then she said hoarsely and cheerfully, \u201cI\u2019ll have a little party with you and Angelo and his wife, if she\u2019ll come.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAw, that\u2019s sweet, Santa, but I don\u2019t feel much like a party these days.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019ll do you good to shake yourself a little, girl. If I can find out about that old man, I\u2019ll invite him over too. You and him can dance.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWell, if you see the old man, babe, tell him Miss Reilly said, \u2018Hello.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Behind the bathroom door Ignatius was lying passively in the tepid water pushing the plastic soap dish back and forth across the surface with one finger and listening now and then to his mother on the telephone. Occasionally he held the soap dish down until it filled with water and sank. Then he would feel for it on the bottom of the tub, empty it, and sail it again. His blue and yellow eyes rested on an unopened manila envelope on the top of the toilet. For quite a while Ignatius had been trying to decide whether or not he would open the envelope. The trauma of having found employment had affected his valve negatively, and he was waiting until the warm water in which he wallowed like a pink hippopotamus had a calming effect upon his system. Then he would attack the envelope. Paradise Vendors should prove to be a pleasant employer. He would spend his time parked somewhere by the river accumulating notes for the Journal. Mr. Clyde had a certain paternal quality that Ignatius liked; the old man, the scarred and wizened mogul of the frankfurter, would be a welcome new character in the Journal.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 At last Ignatius felt relaxed enough and, raising his dripping hulk out of the water, picked up the envelope.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhy must she use this sort of envelope?\u201d he asked angrily, studying the little circle of a Planetarium Station, New York, postmark on the thick tan paper.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe contents are probably written in marking pencil or worse.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He tore the envelope open, wetting the paper, and pulled out a folded poster that said in large letters:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 LECTURE!

Minkoff\u2019s Petition Which Aggressively Demands More and Better Sex for All and a Crash Program for Minorities! (The petition will be mailed to Washington.) Sign now and save America from sexual ignorance, chastity, and fear. Are you committed enough to helpin this bold and crucial movement?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOh, my God!\u201d Ignatius spurted through his dripping moustache. \u201cAre they letting her speak in public now? What in the world does the title of this ludicrous lecture mean?\u201d Ignatius read the poster again, viciously. \u201cAt any rate, I know that she will speak boldly, and in a perverse way I wish that I could hear that little minx babbling before an audience. This time she has outdone herself in offending taste and decency.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Following a handwritten arrow at the bottom of the poster and the word over, Ignatius complied and looked at the other side of the poster, where Myrna had written something:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sirs:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What is wrong, Ignatius? I have not heard from you. Well, I don\u2019t really blame you for not writing. I guess I came on a little strong in my last letter, but it was only because your paranoid fantasy disturbed me, rooted as it possibly was in your unhealthy attitude toward sex. You know that ever since I first met you I have directed pointed questions at you in order to clarify your sexual inclinations. My only desire was to aid you in finding your true self-expression and contentment through satisfying, natural orgasm. I respect your mind and I have always accepted your eccentric tendencies and that is why I want to see you reach the plateau of perfect mental-sexual balance. (A good, explosive orgasm would cleanse your being and bring you out of the shadows.) Just don\u2019t be angry at me about the letter.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I will explain this poster a little later in this letter because I imagine you are interested in knowing how this bold, dedicated lecture came about. First, though, I must tell you that the movie is off, so if you were planning to play the landlord, forget it. Basically, we had trouble with funds. I could not milk another drachma out of my father, so Leola, the Harlem find, got very hostile about salary (or lack of it) and finally dropped a remark or two that sounded a little anti-Semitic to me. Who needs a girl who isn\u2019t dedicated enough to work gratis in a project that would benefit her race? Samuel has decided to become a forest ranger in Montana because he is planning a dramatic allegory set in a dark woods (Ignorance and Custom) and he wants to get the feel of the forest. From what I know of Samuel, he will be a big flop as a ranger, but the allegory, I know, will be challenging and controversial, full of unpleasant truths. Wish him well. He is fantastic.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To get back to the lecture. At last it seems that I am finding a platform for my philosophy, etc. It all happened in a strange way. A few weeks ago I was at a party that some friends were giving for this very real boy who had just returned from Israel. He was unbelievable. I mean that.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ignatius emitted a little Paradise gas.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For hours and hours he sang these folk songs he had picked up over there; really significant songs that proved my theory that music should basically be an instrument of social protest and expression. He kept us all in that apartment for hours and hours listening and asking for more. Later we all started talking on many levels and I let him know what was on my mind in general.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHo, hum,\u201d Ignatius yawned violently.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He said, \u201cWhy are you keeping all of this to yourself, Myrna? Why haven\u2019t you let the world in on this?\u201d I told him that I often spoke in discussion groups and in my group therapy group. I also told him about these letters of mine to the editor that have been printed in The New Democracy and Man and Masses\nand Now!\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGet out of that tub, boy,\u201d Ignatius heard his mother scream outside the door of the bathroom.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you going to use it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThen please go away.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou been in there too long.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cPlease! I am attempting to read a letter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cA letter? Who wrote you a letter?\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMy dear friend, Miss Minkoff.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe last thing you said was she got you fired outta Levy Pants.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWell, she did. However, it might have been a favor in disguise. My new work may prove rather agreeable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAin\u2019t that awful,\u201d Mrs. Reilly said sadly. \u201cYou get fired outta a two-bit clerk job in a factory and now you selling weenies in the streets. Well, I\u2019ll tell you one thing, Ignatius, you better not get fired by the weenie man. You know what Santa said?\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sure that it was rather perceptive and incisive, whatever it was. I would imagine that it is rather difficult to comprehend her assaults upon the Mother tongue.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cShe said somebody oughta punch you right in the nose.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cComing from her, that\u2019s rather literate.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhat that Myrna\u2019s doing now?\u201d Mrs. Reilly asked suspiciously. \u201cHow come she\u2019s writing so much? She needed a good bath, that girl.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMyrna\u2019s psyche is only capable of dealing with water in an oral context.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWill you please stop shrieking like a fishmonger and run along? Don\u2019t you have a bottle of muscatel baking in the oven? Now let me alone. I\u2019m very nervous.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNervous? You been in that hot water over an hour.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s hardly hot anymore.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThen get out the tub.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhy is it so important to you that I leave this tub? Mother, I really don\u2019t understand you at all. Isn\u2019t there something that, as a housekeeper, you feel compelled to do at the moment? I noticed this morning that the lint in the hallway is forming into spheres almost as large as baseballs. Clean the house. Telephone for the correct time. Do something. Lie down and take a nap. You\u2019re looking rather peaked these days.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOf course I am, boy. You breaking your poor momma\u2019s heart. What would you do if I dropped dead?\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWell, I am not going to participate in this idiotic conversation. Carry on a monologue out there if you wish. Quietly. I must concentrate upon the new offenses that M. Minkoff has conceived in this letter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t take it no more, Ignatius. You gonna find me laying in the kitchen one of these days with a stroke. Just watch, boy. You gonna be all alone in the world. Then you gonna fall on your knees and pray to God for the way you treated your poor dear mother.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 From the bathroom there came only silence. Mrs. Reilly waited for at least a splash of water or a rustle of paper, but the bathroom door might as well have been the door of a tomb. After a minute or two of fruitless waiting, she walked off down the hall toward the oven. When Ignatius heard the oven door creak open he returned to the letter.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He said, \u201cWith that voice and personality, you should be appearing before the people in prison.\u201d This guy was really amazing; in addition to his tough mind, he was a real mensch. He was so gentlemanly and thoughtful I could hardly believe it. (Especially after dealing with Samuel, who is dedicated and unafraid but all a little too loud and something of a clod.) I never met anybody so dedicated to fighting reactionary ideas and prejudice as this folk singer. His very best friend was a Negro abstractionist, he said, who made magnificent smears of protest and defiance across the canvas, sometimes slashing the canvas to shreds with a knife. He handed me this brilliant pamphlet that showed in detail how the Pope is trying to assemble a nuclear armory; it really opened my mind, and I forwarded it to the editor of The New Democracy to aid him in his battle against the Church. But this guy also had this big thing against WASPS. Like he hated them. I mean, this fellow was sharp.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The next day I got a telephone call from him. Would I lecture to this social action group he was going to form somewhere in Brooklyn Heights? I was overcome. In this world of dog eat dog, it is rare to find a friend... a really sincere friend... or so I thought. Well, to make my point as briefly as possible, I had learned the hard way that the lecture circuit is something like show business: the casting couch and that routine.\nGet what I mean?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDo I believe this egregious offense against good taste that I am reading?\u201d Ignatius asked the floating soap dish. \u201cThis girl is without shame entirely!\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Again I have been awakened to the fact that my body appeals to some people more than my mind.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHo hum,\u201d Ignatius sighed.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Personally, I feel like exposing this phony \u201cfolk singer\u201d who I guess is preying on some other dedicated young girl liberal at this moment. Somebody I know said she heard this \u201cfolk singer\u201d guy is really a Baptist from Alabama. Boy, what a fraud he was. So then I checked on this pamphlet he had given me and discovered that it was printed by the Klan. This will give you some idea of the ideological subtleties which we have to deal with today. It sounded like a good liberal pamphlet to me. Now I have had to humiliate myself by writing to the editor of The New Democracy to tell him that the pamphlet, although challenging, was written by the wrong people. Well, the WASPS struck back and got me this time. The incident reminded me of the time in Poe Park when this squirrel I was feeding turned out to really be a rat which at first glance could have passed for a squirrel any day. So live and learn. This phony gave me an idea. You can always learn something from crumbs. I decided to ask up here at the \u2018Y\u2019 if I could get the auditorium one night. After a while, they said o.k. Of course, the audience up here at the Bronx \u2018Y\u2019 will probably be a little parochial, but if I make good in the lecture, I might one day end up speaking down at the Lex. Ave. \u2018Y\u2019 where great thinkers like Norman Mailer and Seymour Krim are always airing their views. It won\u2019t hurt to try.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I hope that you are working on your personality problems, Ignatius. Is the paranoia getting any worse? The basis for the paranoia, I think, is the fact that you\u2019re always sealed up in that room and have become suspicious of the outside world. I don\u2019t know why you insisted on living way down there with the alligators. In spite of the complete overhaul that your mind is crying for, you have a brain that could really grow and flower here in N.Y. As it is, you are thwarting yourself and your mentality. The last time I saw you, when I was passing through from Mississippi, you were in pretty bad shape. You\u2019ve probably regressed completely by now living in that substandard old house with only your mother for company. Aren\u2019t your natural impulses crying for release? A beautiful and meaningful love affair would transform you, Ignatius. I know it would. Great Oedipus bonds are encircling your brain and destroying you.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I don\u2019t imagine that your sociological or political ideas are getting any more progressive either. Have you abandoned your project to form a political party or nominate a candidate for president by divine right? I remember that when I finally met you and challenged your political apathy, you came up with this idea. I knew that it was a reactionary project, but it at least showed that you were developing some political consciousness. Please write to me about the matter. I am very concerned. We need a three-party system in this country, and I think that day by day the fascists are growing in strength. This Divine Right Party is the sort of fringe-group scheme that would syphon off a large part of the fascist support.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Well, let me stop. I hope the lecture is a success. You, especially, would benefit from its message. By the way, if you ever do activate the Divine Right movement, I can give you some help in organizing a chapter up here. Please get out of the house, Ignatius, and enter into the world around you. I am worried about your future. You have always been one of my most important projects and I am interested in hearing of your current mental condition, so please get out of the pillows and write.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 M. Minkoff\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Later, his puckered pink skin wrapped in the old flannel robe that a safety pin held around his hips, Ignatius sat at the desk in his room filling his fountain pen. In the hall his mother was speaking to someone else on the telephone saying, \u201cAnd I used every last cent of the insurance money his poor old Grammaw Reilly left just to keep him in college. Ain\u2019t that awful? All that money down the drain.\u201d Ignatius belched and opened a drawer to search for the stationery that he believed he still had; there he found the yo-yo that he had bought from the Filipino who had been selling them in the neighborhood a few months ago. On one side of the yo-yo there was a palm tree which the Filipino had carved at Ignatius\u2019 request. Ignatius spun the yo-yo downward, but the string snapped and it rattled across the floor and under the bed where it landed on a pile of Big Chief tablets and old magazines. Removing the piece of string that hung from his finger, he dug into the drawer again and found a sheet of paper with a Levy Pants letterhead.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Beloved Myrna:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I have received your offensive communication. Do you seriously think that I am interested in your tawdry encounters with such sub-humans as folk singers? In every letter of yours I seem to find some reference to the sleaziness of your personal life. Please confine yourself to discussing issues and such; thereby you will at least avoid obscenity and offense. I did think, however, that the symbolism of the rat and squirrel or rat-squirrel or squirrel-rat was evocative and rather excellent.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 On the dark night of that dubious lecture, the sole member of your audience will probably be some desperately lonely old male librarian who saw a light in the window of the lecture hall and hopefully came in to escape the cold and the horrors of his personal hell. There in the hall, his stooped figure sitting alone before the podium, your nasal voice echoing among the empty chairs and hammering boredom, confusion, and sexual reference deeper and deeper into the poor wretch\u2019s bald skull, confounded to the point of hysteria, he will doubtlessly exhibit himself, waving his crabbed organ like a club in despair against the grim sound that drones on and on over his head. If I were you, I would cancel the lecture immediately; I am certain that the \u2018Y\u2019 management would be only too glad to accept your withdrawal, especially if they have had a chance to see that tasteless poster which is now no doubt tacked to every telephone pole in the Bronx.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The comments upon my personal life were uncalled for and revealed a shocking lack of taste and decency.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Actually, my personal life has undergone a metamorphosis: I am currently connected in a most vital manner with the food merchandising industry, and therefore I doubt quite seriously whether I shall have much time in the future to correspond with you.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Busily,\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 IgnatiusEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/462325", "artist_names": "Marcel Proust", "full_title": "A Visit from Albertine (Chapter 2) by\u00a0Marcel\u00a0Proust", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1374036251_Marcel_Proust_1900-2.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1374036251_Marcel_Proust_1900-2.jpg", "id": 462325, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 184747, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1404063896, "path": "/Marcel-proust-a-visit-from-albertine-chapter-2-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Marcel-proust-a-visit-from-albertine-chapter-2-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1374036251_Marcel_Proust_1900-2.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1374036251_Marcel_Proust_1900-2.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 6946}, "title": "A Visit from Albertine (Chapter 2)", "title_with_featured": "A Visit from Albertine (Chapter 2)", "updated_by_human_at": 1668617359, "url": "https://genius.com/Marcel-proust-a-visit-from-albertine-chapter-2-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/57252", "header_image_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1374036251_Marcel_Proust_1900-2.jpg", "id": 57252, "image_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1374036251_Marcel_Proust_1900-2.jpg", "index_character": "m", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Marcel Proust", "slug": "Marcel-proust", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Marcel-proust"}, "artist": "Marcel Proust", "lyrics": "A Visit from Albertine (Chapter 2) Lyrics\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CHAPTER TWO\n\nA VISIT FROM ALBERTINE \u2014 PROSPECT OF RICH BRIDES FOR CERTAIN FRIENDS OF SAINT-LOUP \u2014 THE WIT OF THE GUERMANTES, AS DISPLAYED BEFORE THE PRINCESSE DE PARME \u2014 A STRANGE VISIT TO M. DE CHARLUS \u2014 HIS CHARACTER PUZZLES ME MORE AND MORE \u2014 THE RED SHOES OF THE DUCHESS\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albeit it was simply a Sunday in autumn, I had been born again, life lay intact before me, for that morning, after a succession of mild days, there had been a cold mist which had not cleared until nearly midday. A change in the weather is sufficient to create the world and oneself anew. Formerly, when the wind howled in my chimney, I would listen to the blows which it struck on the iron trap with as keen an emotion as if, like the famous bow-taps with which the C Minor Symphony opens, they had been the irresistible appeal of a mysterious destiny. Every change in the aspect of nature offers us a similar transformation by adapting our desires so as to harmonise with the new form of things. The mist, from the moment of my awakening, had made of me, instead of the centrifugal being which one is on fine days, a self-centred man, longing for the chimney corner and the nuptial couch, a shivering Adam in quest of a sedentary Eve, in this different world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Between the soft grey tint of a morning landscape and the taste of a cup of chocolate I tried to account for all the originality of the physical, intellectual and moral life which I had taken with me, about a year earlier, to Donci\u00e8res, and which, blazoned with the oblong form of a bare hillside \u2014 always present even when it was invisible \u2014 formed in me a series of pleasures entirely distinct from all others, incommunicable to my friends, in the sense that the impressions, richly interwoven with one another, which gave them their orchestral accompaniment were a great deal more characteristic of them, to my subconscious mind, than any facts that I might have related. From this point of view the new world in which the mist of this morning had immersed me was a world already known to me (which only made it more real) and forgotten for some time (which restored all its novelty). And I was able to look at several of the pictures of misty landscapes which my memory had acquired, notably a series of \u2018Mornings at Donci\u00e8res,\u2019 including my first morning there in barracks and another, in a neighbouring country house, where I had gone with Saint-Loup to spend the night: in which from the windows, whose curtains I had drawn back at daybreak, before getting into bed again, in the first a trooper, in the second (on the thin margin of a pond and a wood all the rest of which was engulfed in the uniform and liquid softness of the mist) a coachman busy polishing a strap had appeared to me like those rare figures, scarcely visible to the eye obliged to adapt itself to the mysterious vagueness of their half-lights, which emerge from an obliterated fresco\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was from my bed that I was looking this afternoon at these pictorial memories, for I had gone back to bed to wait until the hour came at which, taking advantage of the absence of my parents, who had gone for a few days to Combray, I proposed to get up and go to a little play which was being given that evening in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room. Had they been at home I should perhaps not have ventured to go out; my mother in the delicacy of her respect for my grandmother\u2019s memory, wished the tokens of regret that were paid to it to be freely and sincerely given; she would not have forbidden me this outing, she would have disapproved of it. From Combray, on the other hand, had I consulted her wishes, she would not have replied in a melancholy: \u201cDo just as you like; you are old enough now to know what is right or wrong,\u201d but, reproaching herself for having left me alone in Paris, and measuring my grief by her own, would have wished for it distractions of a sort which she would have refused to herself, and which she persuaded herself that my grandmother, solicitous above all things for my health and the preservation of my nervous balance, would have advised me to take\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That morning the furnace of the new steam heater had for the first time been lighted. Its disagreeable sound \u2014 an intermittent hiccough \u2014 had no part whatsoever in my memories of Donci\u00e8res. But its prolonged encounter, in me this afternoon, with them was to give it so lasting an affinity with them that whenever, after succeeding more or less in forgetting it, I heard the central heater hiccough again it reminded me of them\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was no one else in the house but Fran\u00e7oise. The grey light, falling like a fine rain on the earth, wove without ceasing a transparent web through which the Sunday holiday-makers appeared in a silvery sheen. I had flung to the foot of my bed the Figaro, for which I had been sending out religiously every morning, ever since I had sent in an article which it had not yet printed; despite the absence of the sun, the intensity of the daylight was an indication that we were still only half-way through the afternoon. The tulle window-curtains, vaporous and friable as they would not have been on a fine day, had that same blend of beauty and fragility that dragon flies\u2019 wings have, and Venetian glass. It depressed me all the more that I should be spending this Sunday by myself because I had sent a note that morning to Mlle, de Stermaria. Robert de Saint-Loup, whom his mother had at length succeeded in parting \u2014 after painful and abortive attempts \u2014 from his mistress, and who immediately afterwards had been sent to Morocco in the hope of his there forgetting one whom he had already for some little time ceased to love, had sent me a line, which had reached me the day before, announcing his arrival, presently, in France for a short spell of leave. As he would only be passing through Paris (where his family were doubtless afraid of seeing him renew relations with Rachel), he informed me, to shew me that he had been thinking of me, that he had met at Tangier Mile, or rather Mme. (for she had divorced her husband three months after their marriage) de Stermaria. And Robert, remembering what I had told him at Balbec, had asked her, on my behalf, to arrange a meeting. She would be delighted to dine with me, she had told him, on one of the evenings which, before her return to Brittany, she would be spending in Paris. He warned me to lose no time in writing to Mme. de Stermaria, for she would certainly have arrived before I got his letter. This had corne as no surprise to me, even although I had had no news of him since, at the time of my grandmother\u2019s last illness, he had accused me of perfidy and treachery. It had then been quite easy to see what must have happened. Rachel, who liked to provoke his jealousy \u2014 she had other reasons also for wishing me harm \u2014 had persuaded her lover that I had made a dastardly attempt to have relations with her in his absence. It is probable that he continued to believe in the truth of this allegation, but he had ceased to be in love with her, which meant that its truth or falsehood had become a matter of complete indifference to him, and our friendship alone remained. When, on meeting him again, I attempted to speak to him about his attack on me his sole answer was a cordial and friendly smile, which gave him the air of begging my pardon; then he turned the conversation to something else. All this was not to say that he did not, a little later, see Rachel occasionally when he was in Paris. The fellow-creatures who have played a leading part in one\u2019s life very rarely disappear from it suddenly with any finality. They return to take their old place in it at odd moments (so much so as to lead people to believe in a renewal of old love) before leaving it for ever. Saint-Loup\u2019s breach with Rachel had very soon become less painful to him, thanks to the soothing pleasure that was given him by her incessant demands for money. Jealousy, which prolongs the course of love, is not capable of containing many more ingredients than are the other forms of imagination. If one takes with one, when one starts on a journey, three or four images which incidentally one is sure to lose on the way (such as the lilies and anemones heaped on the Ponte Vecchio, or the Persian church shrouded in mist), one\u2019s trunk is already pretty full. When one parts from a mistress one would be just as glad, until one has begun to forget her, that she should not become the property of three or four potential protectors whom one has in one\u2019s mind\u2019s eye, of whom, that is to say, one is jealous: all those whom one does not so picture count for nothing. Now frequent demands for money from a cast-off mistress no more give one a complete idea of her life than charts shewing a high temperature would of her illness. But the latter would at any rate be an indication that she was ill, and the former furnish a presumption, vague enough, it is true, that the forsaken one, or forsaker (whichever she be) cannot have found anything very remarkable in the way of rich protectors. And so each demand is welcomed with the joy which a lull produces in the jealous one\u2019s sufferings, while he responds to it at once by dispatching money, for naturally he does not like to think of her being in want of anything, except lovers (one of the three lovers he has in his mind\u2019s eye), until time has enabled him to regain his composure and he can learn without the slightest emotion the name of his successor. Sometimes Rachel came in so late at night that she could ask her former lover\u2019s permission to lie down beside him until the morning. This was a great comfort to Robert, for it refreshed his memory of how they had, after all, lived in intimacy together merely to see that even if he took the greater part of the bed for himself it did not in the least interfere with her sleep. He realised that she was more comfortable, lying close to his body, than she would have been elsewhere, that she felt herself, by his side \u2014 even in an hotel \u2014 to be in a bedroom known of old, in which the force of habit prevails and one sleeps better. He felt that his shoulders, his limbs, all of him were for her, even when he was unduly restless, from sleeplessness or from having to get up in the night things so entirely usual that they could not disturb her, and that the perception of them added still further to her sense of repose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To revert to where we were, I had been all the more disquieted by Robert\u2019s letter in that I could read between the lines what he had not ventured to write more explicitly. \u201cYou can most certainly ask her to dine in a private room,\u201d he told me. \u201cShe is a charming young person, a delightful nature you will get on splendidly with her, and I am sure you will have a capital evening together.\u201d As my parents were returning at the end of the week on Saturday or Sunday, and as after that I should be forced to dine every evening at home, I had written at once to Mme. de Stermaria, proposing any evening that might suit her, up to Friday. A message was brought back that I should hear from her in writing the same evening, about eight o\u2019clock. The time would have passed quickly enough if I had had, during the afternoon that separated me from her letter, the help of a visit from anyone else. When the hours pass wrapped in conversation one ceases to count, or indeed to notice them, they vanish, and suddenly it is a long way beyond the point at which it escaped you that there reappears the nimble truant time. But if we are alone, our preoccupation, by bringing before us the still distant and incessantly awaited moment with the frequency and uniformity of a ticking pendulum, divides, or rather multiplies the hours by all the minutes which, had we been with friends, we should not have counted. And confronted, by the incessant return of my desire, with the ardent pleasure which I was going to taste \u2014 not for some days though, alas! \u2014 in Mme. de Stermaria\u2019s company, this afternoon, which I should have to spend by myself, seemed to me very empty and very melancholy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every now and then I heard the sound of the lift coming up, but it was followed by a second sound, not that for which I was hoping, namely the sound of its coming to a halt at our landing, but another very different sound which the lift made in continuing its progress to the floors above and which, because it so often meant the desertion of my floor when I was expecting a visitor, remained for me at other times, even when I had no wish to see anyone, a sound lugubrious in itself, in which there echoed, as it were, a sentence of solitary confinement. Weary, resigned, busy for several hours still over its immemorial task, the grey day stitched its shimmering needlework of light and shade, and it saddened me to think that I was to be left alone with a thing that knew me no more than would a seamstress who, installed by the window so as to see better while she finished her work, paid no attention to the person present with her in the room. Suddenly, although I had heard no bell, Fran\u00e7oise opened the door to let in Albertine, who came forward smiling, silent, plump, containing in the fulness of her body, made ready so that I might continue living them, come in search of me, the days we had spent together at that Balbec to which I had never since returned. No doubt, whenever we see again a person with whom our relations \u2014 however trivial they may have been \u2014 are altered, it is like a juxtaposition of two different periods. For this, we do not require that a former mistress should come to call upon us as a friend, all that we need is the visit to Paris of a person whom we had known in the daily round of some particular kind of life, and that this life should have ceased for us, were it no more than a week ago. On each of Albertine\u2019s smiling, questioning, blushing features I could read the questions: \u201cAnd Madame de Villeparisis? And the dancing-master? And the pastry-cook?\u201d When she sat down her back seemed to be saying: \u201cGracious! There\u2019s no cliff here; you don\u2019t mind if I sit down beside you, all the same, as I used to do at Balbec?\u201d She was like an enchantress handing me a mirror that reflected time. In this she was like all the people whom we seldom see now but with whom at one time we lived on more intimate terms. With Al-bertine, however, there was something more than this. Certainly, even at Balbec, in our daily encounters, I had always been surprised when she came in sight, so variable was her appearance from day to day. But now it was difficult to recognise her. Cleared of the pink vapour that used to bathe them, her features had emerged like those of a statue. She had another face, or rather she had a face at last; her body too had grown. There remained scarcely anything now of the shell in which she had been enclosed and on the surface of which, at Balbec, her future outline had been barely visible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This time, Albertine had returned to Paris earlier than usual. As a rule she came only in the spring, which meant that, already disturbed for some weeks past by the storms that were beating down the first flowers, I did not distinguish, in the elements of the pleasure that I felt, the return of Albertine from that of the fine weather. It was enough that I should be told that she was in Paris and that she had called at the house, for me to see her again like a rose flowering by the sea. I cannot say whether it was the desire for Balbec or for herself that overcame me at such moments; possibly my desire for her was itself a lazy, cowardly, and incomplete method of possessing Balbec, as if to possess a thing materially, to take up one\u2019s abode in a town, were equivalent to possessing it spiritually. Besides, even materially, when she was no longer posed by my imagination before a horizon of sea, but sitting still in a room with me, she seemed to me often a very poor specimen of a rose, so poor, indeed, that I would gladly have shut my eyes in order not to observe this or that blemish of its petals, and to imagine instead that I was inhaling the salt air on the beach\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I must say it at this point, albeit I was not then aware of what was to happen only later on. Certainly, it is more reasonable to devote one\u2019s life to women than to postage stamps or old snuff-boxes, even to pictures or statues. Only the example of other collectors should be a warning to us to make changes, to have not one woman only but several. Those charming suggestions in which a girl abounds of a sea-beach, of the braided hair of a statue in church, of an old print, of everything that makes one see and admire in her, whenever she appears, a charming composition, those suggestions are not very stable. Live with a woman altogether and you will soon cease to see any of the things that made you love her; though I must add that these two sundered elements can be reunited by jealousy. If, after a long period of life in common, I was to end by seeing nothing more in Albertine than an ordinary woman, an intrigue between her and some person whom she had loved at Balbec would still suffice, perhaps, to reincorporate in her, to amalgamate the beach and the unrolling of the tide. Only, as these secondary suggestions no longer captivate our eyes, it is to the heart that they are perceptible and fatal. We cannot, under so dangerous a form, regard the repetition of the miracle as a thing to be desired. But I am anticipating the course of years. And here I need only state my regret that I did not have the sense simply to have kept my collection of women as people keep their collections of old quizzing glasses, never so complete, in their cabinet, that there is not room always for another and rarer still\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Departing from the customary order of her holiday movements, this year she had come straight from Balbec, where furthermore she had not stayed nearly so late as usual. It was a long time since I had seen her, and as I did not know even by name the people with whom she was in the habit of mixing in Paris, I could form no impression of her during the periods in which she abstained from coming to see me. These lasted often for quite a time. Then, one fine day, in would burst Albertine whose rosy apparitions and silent visits left me little if any better informed as to what she might have been doing in an interval which remained plunged in that darkness of her hidden life which my eyes felt little anxiety to pierce\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This time, however, certain signs seemed to indicate that some new experience must have entered into that life. And yet, perhaps, all that one was entitled to conclude from them was that girls change very rapidly at the age which Albertine had now reached. For instance, her intellect was now more in evidence, and on my reminding her of the day when she had insisted with so much ardour on the superiority of her idea of making Sophocles write: \u201cMy dear Racine,\u201d she was the first to laugh, quite wholeheartedly, at her own stupidity. \u201cAndr\u00e9e was quite right; it was stupid of me,\u201d she admitted. \u201cSophocles ought to have begun: \u2018Sir.\u2019\u201d I replied that the \u2018Sir,\u2019 and \u2018Dear Sir,\u2019 of Andr\u00e9e were no less comic than her own \u2018My dear Racine,\u2019 or Gis\u00e8le\u2019s \u2018My dear Friend,\u2019 but that after all the really stupid people were the Professors who still went on making Sophocles write letters to Racine. Here, however, Albertine was unable to follow me. She could not see in what the silliness consisted; her intelligence was dawning, but had not fully developed. There were other more attractive novelties in her; I felt, in this same pretty girl who had just sat down by my bed, something that was different; and in those lines which, in one\u2019s eyes and other features, express one\u2019s general attitude towards life, a change of front, a partial conversion, as though there had now been shattered those resistances against which I had hurled my strength in vain at Balbec, one evening, now remote in time, on which we formed a couple symmetrical with but the converse of our present arrangement, since then it had lieen she who was lying down and I who sat by her bedside. Wishing and not venturing to make certain whether now she would let herself be kissed, every time that she rose to go I asked her to stay beside me a little longer. This was a concession not very easy to obtain, for albeit she had nothing to do (otherwise she would have rushed from the house) she was a person methodical in her habits and moreover not very gracious towards me, scarcely to be at ease in my company, and yet each time, after looking at her watch, she sat down again at my request until finally she had spent several hours with me without my having asked her for anything; the things I was saying to her followed logically those that I had said during the hours before, and bore no relation to what I was thinking about, what I desired from her, remained indefinitely parallel. There is nothing like desire for preventing the thing one says from bearing any resemblance to what one has in one\u2019s mind. Time presses, and yet it seems as though we were seeking to gain time by speaking of subjects absolutely alien to that by which we are obsessed. We then arrange that the sentence which we should like to utter shall be accompanied, or rather preluded, by a gesture, supposing that is to say that we have not to give ourselves the pleasure of an immediate demonstration and to gratify the curiosity we feel as to the reactions which will follow it, without a word said, without even a \u2018By your leave,\u2019 already made this gesture. Certainly I was not in the least in love with Albertine; child of the mists outside, she could merely content the imaginative desire which the change of weather had awakened in me and which was midway between the desires that are satisfied by the arts of the kitchen and of monumental sculpture respectively, for it made me dream simultaneously of mingling with my flesh a substance different and warm, and of attaching at some point to my outstretched body a body divergent, as the body of Eve barely holds by the feet to the side of Adam, to whose body hers is almost perpendicular, in those romanesque bas-reliefs on the church at Balbec which represent in so noble and so reposeful a fashion, still almost like a classical frieze, the Creation of Woman; God in them is everywhere followed, as by two ministers, by two little angels in whom the visitor recognises \u2014 like winged, swarming summer creatures which winter has surprised and spared \u2014 cupids from Herculaneum, still surviving well into the thirteenth century, and winging their last slow flight, weary but never failing in the grace that might be expected of them, over the whole front of the porch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for this pleasure which by accomplishing my desire would have set me free from these meditations and which I should have sought quite as readily from any other pretty woman, had I been asked upon what \u2014 in the course of this endless flow of talk throughout which I took care to keep from Albertine the one thing that was in my mind \u2014 was based my optimistic hypothesis with regard to her possible complaisances, I should perhaps have answered that this hypothesis was due (while the forgotten outlines of Albertine\u2019s voice retraced for me the contour of her personality) to the apparition of certain words which did not form part of her vocabulary, or at least not in the acceptation which she now gave them. Thus she said to roe that Elstir was stupid, and, on my protesting:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she replied, smiling, \u201cI mean that it was stupid of him to behave like that; of course I know he\u2019s quite a distinguished Person, really.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, wishing to say of the Fontainebleau golf club that it was smart, she declared: \u201cThey are quite a selection.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Speaking of a duel that I had fought, she said of my seconds: \u201cWhat very choice seconds,\u201d and looking at my face confessed that she would like to see me \u2018wear a moustache.\u2019 She even went so far (and my chance appeared then enormous) as to announce, in a phrase of which I would have sworn that she was ignorant a year earlier, that since she had last seen Gis\u00e8le there had passed a certain \u2018lapse of time.\u2019 This was not to say that Albertine had not already possessed, when I was at Balbec, a quite adequate assortment of those expressions which reveal at once that one\u2019s people are in easy circumstances, and which, year by year, a mother passes on to her daughter just as she bestows on her, gradually, as the girl grows up, on important occasions, her own jewels. It was evident that Albertine had ceased to be a little girl when one day, to express her thanks for a present which a strange lady had given her, she had said: \u201cI am quite confused.\u201d Mme. Bontemps could not help looking across at her husband whose comment was:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGad, she\u2019s old for fourteen.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The approach of nubility had been more strongly marked still when Albertine, speaking of another girl whose tone was bad, said: \u201cOne can\u2019t even tell whether she\u2019s pretty, she paints her face a foot thick.\u201d Finally, though still a schoolgirl, she already displayed the manner of a grown woman of her upbringing and station when she said, of some one whose face twitched: \u201cI can\u2019t look at him, because it makes me want to do the same,\u201d or, if some one else were being imitated: \u201cThe absurd thing about it is that when you imitate her voice you look exactly like her.\u201d All these are drawn from the social treasury. But it did not seem to me possible that Albertine\u2019s natural environment could have supplied her with \u2018distinguished,\u2019 used in the sense in which my father would say of a colleague whom he had not actually met, but whose intellectual attainments he had heard praised: \u201cIt appears he\u2019s quite a distinguished person.\u201d \u2018Selection,\u2019 even when used of a golf club, seemed to me as incompatible with the Simonet family as it would be if preceded by the adjective \u2018Natural,\u2019 with a text published centuries before the researches of Darwin. \u2018Lapse of time\u2019 struck me as being of better augury still. Finally there appeared the evidence of certain upheavals, the nature of which was unknown to me, but sufficient to justify me in all my hopes when Albertine announced, with the satisfaction of a person whose opinion is by no means to be despised:\nYou might also like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo my mind, that is the best thing that could possibly happen. I regard it as the best solution, the stylish way out.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was so novel, so manifestly an alluvial deposit giving one to suspect such capricious wanderings over soil hitherto unknown to her, that on hearing the words \u2018to my mind\u2019 I drew Albertine towards me, and at \u2018I regard\u2019 made her sit on the side of my bed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt it does happen that women of moderate culture, on marrying well-read men, receive such expressions as part of their paraphernalia. And shortly after the metamorphosis which follows the wedding night, when they begin to pay calls, and talk shyly to the friends of their girlhood, one notices with surprise that they have turned into matrons if, in deciding that some person is intelligent, they sound both l\u2019s in the word; but that is precisely the sign of a change of state, and I could see a difference when I thought of the vocabulary of the Albertine I had known of old \u2014 a vocabulary in which the most daring flights were to say of any unusual person: \u2018He\u2019s a type,\u2019 or, if you suggested a game of cards to her: \u2018I\u2019ve no money to lose,\u2019 or again, if any of her friends were to reproach her, in terms which she felt to be undeserved: \u2018That really is magnificent!\u2019 an expression dictated in such cases by a sort of middle-class tradition almost as old as the Magnificat itself, and one which a girl slightly out of temper and confident that she is in the right employs, as the saying is, \u2018quite naturally,\u2019 that is to say because she has learned the words from her mother, just as she has learned to say her prayers or to greet a friend. All these expressions Mme. Bontemps had imparted to her at the same time as her hatred of the Jews and her feeling for black, which was always suitable and becoming, indeed without any formal instruction, but as the piping of the parent goldfinches serves as a model for that of the young ones, recently hatched, so that they in turn grow into true goldfinches also. But when all was said, \u2018selection\u2019 appeared to me of alien growth and \u2018I regard\u2019 encouraging. Albertine was no longer the same; which meant that she would not perhaps act, would not react in the same way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only did I no longer feel any love for her, but I had no longer to consider, as I should have had at Balbec, the risk of shattering in her an affection for myself, which no longer existed. There could be no doubt that she had long since become quite indifferent to me. I was well aware that to her I was in no sense a member now of the \u2018little band\u2019 into which I had at one time so anxiously sought and had then been so happy to have secured admission. Besides, as she had no longer even, as in Balbec days, an air of frank good nature, I felt no serious scruples: still I believe that what made me finally decide was another philological discovery. As, continuing to add fresh links to the external chain of talk behind which I hid my intimate desire, I spoke, having Albertine secure now on the corner of my bed, of one of the girls of the little band, one smaller than the rest, whom, nevertheless, I had thought quite pretty, \u201cYes,\u201d answered Albertine, \u201cshe reminds me of a little mousm\u00e9.\u201d There had been nothing in the world to shew, when I first knew Albertine, that she had ever heard the wordmousm\u00e9. It was probable that, had things followed their normal course, she would never have learned it, and for my part I should have seen no cause for regret in that, for there is no more horrible word in the language. The mere sound of it makes one\u2019s teeth ache as they do when one has put too large a spoonful of ice in one\u2019s mouth. But coming from Albertine, as she sat there looking so pretty, not even \u2018mousm\u00e9\u2018 could strike me as unpleasant. On the contrary, I felt it to be a revelation, if not of an outward initiation, at any rate of an inward evolution. Unfortunately it was now time for me to bid her good-bye if I wished her to reach home in time for her dinner, and myself to be out of bed and dressed in time for my own. It was Fran\u00e7oise who was getting it ready; she did not like having to keep it back, and must already have found it an infringement of one of the articles of her code that Albertine, in the absence of my parents, should be paying me so prolonged a visit, and one which was going to make everything late. But before \u2018mousm\u00e9\u2018 all these arguments fell to the ground and I hastened to say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust fancy; I\u2019m not in the least ticklish; you can go on tickling me for an hour on end and I won\u2019t even feel it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI assure you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She understood, doubtless, that this was the awkward expression of a desire on my part, for, like a person who offers to give you an introduction for which you have not ventured to ask him, though what you have said has shewn him that it would be of great service to you\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWould you like me to try?\u201d she inquired, with womanly meekness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust as you like, but you would be more comfortable if you lay down properly on the bed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLike that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; get right on top.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re sure I\u2019m not too heavy?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she uttered these words the door opened and Fran\u00e7oise, carrying a lamp, came in. Albertine had just time to fling herself back upon her chair. Perhaps Fran\u00e7oise had chosen this moment to confound us, having been listening at the door or even peeping through the keyhole. But there was no need to suppose anything of the sort; she might have scorned to assure herself, by the use of her eyes, of what her instinct must plainly enough have detected, for by dint of living with me and my parents her fears, her prudence, her alertness, her cunning had ended by giving her that instinctive and almost prophetic knowledge of us all that the mariner has of the sea, the quarry of the hunter, and, of the malady, if not the physician, often at any rate the patient. The amount of knowledge that she managed to acquire would have astounded a stranger, and with as good reason as does the advanced state of certain arts and sciences among the ancients, seeing that there was practically no source of information open to them. (Her sources were no larger. They were a few casual remarks forming barely a twentieth part of our conversation at dinner, caught on the wing by the butler and inaccurately transmitted to the kitchen.) Again, her mistakes were due, like theirs, like the fables in which Plato believed, rather to a false conception of the world and to preconceived ideas than to the insufficiency of the materials at her disposal. Only the other day, has it not been possible for the most important discoveries as to the habits of insects to be made by a scientist who had access to no laboratory and used no instruments of any sort? But if the drawbacks arising from her menial position had not prevented her from acquiring a stock of learning indispensable to the art which was its ultimate goal \u2014 and which consisted in putting us to confusion by communicating to us the results of her discoveries \u2014 the limitations under which she worked had done more; in this case the impediment, not content with merely not paralysing the flight of her imagination, had greatly strengthened it. Of course Fran\u00e7oise never let slip any artificial device, those for example of diction and attitude. Since (if she never believed what we said to her, hoping that she would believe it) she admitted without any shadow of doubt the truth of anything that any person of her own condition in life might tell her, however absurd, which might at the same time prove shocking to our ideas, just as her way of listening to our assertions bore witness to her incredulity, so the accents in which she reported (the use of indirect speech enabling her to hurl the most deadly insults at us with impunity) the narrative of a cook who had told her how she had threatened her employers, and won from them, by treating them before all the world like dirt, any number of privileges and concessions, shewed that the story was to her as gospel. Fran\u00e7oise went so far as to add: \u201cI\u2019m sure, if I had been the mistress I should have been quite vexed.\u201d In vain might we, despite our scant sympathy at first with the lady on the fourth floor, shrug our shoulders, as though at an unlikely fable, at this report of so shocking an example; in making it the teller was able to speak with the crushing, the lacerating force of the most unquestionable, most irritating affirmation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But above all, just as great writers often attain to a power of concentration from which they would have been dispensed under a system of political liberty or literary anarchy, when they are bound by the tyranny of a monarch or of a school of poetry, by the severity of prosodie laws or of a state religion, so Fran\u00e7oise, not being able to reply to us in an explicit fashion, spoke like Tiresias and would have written like Tacitus. She managed to embody everything that she could not express directly in a sentence for which we could not find fault with her without accusing ourselves, indeed in less than a sentence, in a silence, in the way in which she placed a thing in a room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus when I happened to leave, by accident, on my table, among a pile of other letters, one which it was imperative that she should not see, because, let us say, it referred to her with a dislike which afforded a presumption of the same feeling towards her in the recipient as in the writer, that evening, if I came home with a troubled conscience and went straight to my room, there on top of my letters, neatly arranged in a symmetrical pile, the compromising document caught my eye as it could not possibly have failed to catch the eye of Fran\u00e7oise, placed by her right at the top, almost separated from the rest, in a prominence that was a form of speech, that had an eloquence all its own, and, as I stood in the doorway, made me shudder like a cry. She excelled in the preparation of these scenic effects, intended so to enlighten the spectator, in her absence, that he already knew that she knew everything when in due course she made her appearance. She possessed, for thus making an inanimate object speak, the art, at once inspired and painstaking, of Irving or Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lema\u00eetre. On this occasion, holding over Albertine and myself the lighted lamp whose searching beams missed none of the still visible depressions which the girl\u2019s body had hollowed in the counterpane, Fran\u00e7oise made one think of a picture of \u2018Justice throwing light upon Crime.\u2019 Albertine\u2019s face did not suffer by this illumination. It revealed on her cheeks the same sunny burnish that had charmed me at Balbec. This face of Albertine, the general effect of Which sometimes was, out of doors, a sort of milky pallor, now shewed, according as the lamp shone on them, surfaces so dazzlingly, so uniformly coloured, so firm, so glowing that one might have compared them to the sustained flesh tints of certain flowers. Taken aback meanwhile by the unexpected entry of Fran\u00e7oise, I exclaimed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat? The lamp already? I say, the light is strong!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My object, as may be imagined, was by the second of these ejaculations to account for my confusion, by the first to excuse my lateness in rising. Fran\u00e7oise replied with a cruel ambiguity:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you want me to extinglish it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2014 guish!\u201d Albertine slipped into my ear, leaving me charmed by the familiar vivacity with which, taking me at once for teacher and for accomplice, she insinuated this psychological affirmation as though asking a grammatical question. When Fran\u00e7oise had left the room and Albertine was seated once again on my bed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you know what I\u2019m afraid of?\u201d I asked her. \u201cIt is that if we go on like this I may not be able to resist the temptation to kiss you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat would be a fine pity.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not respond at once to this invitation, which another man might even have found superfluous, for Albertine\u2019s way of pronouncing her words was so carnal, so seductive that merely in speaking to you she seemed to be caressing you. A word from her was a favour, and her conversation covered you with kisses. And yet it was highly attractive to me, this invitation. It would have been so, indeed, coming from any pretty girl of Albertine\u2019s age; but that Albertine should be now so accessible to me gave me more than pleasure, brought before my eyes a series of images that bore the stamp of beauty. I recalled the original Albertine standing between me and the beach, almost painted upon a background of sea, having for me no more real existence than those figures seen on the stage, when one knows not whether one is looking at the actress herself who is supposed to appear, at an understudy who for the moment is taking her principal\u2019s part, or at a mere projection from a lantern. Then the real woman had detached herself from the luminous mass, had come towards me, with the sole result that I had been able to see that she had nothing in real life of that amorous facility which one supposed to be stamped upon her in the magic pictures. I had learned that it was not possible to touch her, to embrace her, that one might only talk to her, that\u2019 for me she was no more a woman than the jade grapes, an inedible decoration at one time in fashion on dinner tables, are really fruit. And now she was appearing to me in a third plane, real as in the second experience that I had had of her but facile as in the first; facile, and all the more deliciously so in that I had so long imagined that she was not. My surplus knowledge of life (of a life less uniform, less simple than I had at first supposed it to be) inclined me provisionally towards agnosticism. What can one positively affirm, when the thing that one thought probable at first has then shewn itself to be false and in the third instance turns out true? And alas, I was not yet at the end of my discoveries with regard to Albertine. In any case, even if there had not been the romantic attraction of this disclosure of a greater wealth of planes revealed one after another by life (an attraction the opposite of that which Saint-Loup had felt during our dinners at Rivebelle on recognising beneath the mask with which the course of existence had overlaid them, in a calm face, features to which his lips had once been pressed), the knowledge that to kiss Albertine\u2019s cheeks was a possible thing was a pleasure perhaps greater even than that of kissing them. What a difference between possessing a woman to whom one applies one\u2019s body alone, because she is no more than a piece of flesh, and possessing the girl whom one used to see on the beach with her friends on certain days without even knowing why one saw her on those days and not on others, which made one tremble to think that one might not see her again. Life had obligingly revealed to one in its whole extent the romance of this little girl, had lent one, for the study of her, first one optical instrument, then another, and had added to one\u2019s carnal desire an accompaniment which multiplied it an hundredfold and diversified it with those other desires, more spiritual and less easily assuaged, which do not emerge from their torpor, leaving carnal desire to move by itself, when it aims only at the conquest of a piece of flesh, but which to gain possession of a whole tract of memories, whence they have felt the wretchedness of exile, rise in a tempest round about it, enlarge, extend it, are unable to follow it to the accomplishment, the assimilation, impossible in the form in which it is looked for, of an immaterial reality, but wait for this desire halfway and at the moment of recollection, of return furnish it afresh with their escort; to kiss, instead of the cheeks of the first comer, however cool and fresh they might be, but anonymous, with no secret, with no distinction, those of which I had so long been dreaming, would be to know the taste, the savour of a colour on which I had endlessly gazed. One has seen a woman, a mere image in the decorative setting of life, like Albertine, outlined against the sea, and then one has been able to take that image, to detach it, to bring it close to oneself, gradually to discern its solidity, its colours, as though one had placed it behind the glasses of a stereoscope. It is for this reason that the women who are a little difficult, whose resistance one does not at once overcome, of whom one does not indeed know at first whether one ever will overcome it, are alone interesting. For to know them, to approach them, to conquer them is to make fluctuate in form, in dimensions, in relief the human image, is an example of relativity in the appreciation of an image which it is delightful to see afresh when it has resumed the slender proportions of a silhouette in the setting of one\u2019s life. The women one meets first of all in a brothel are of no interest because they remain invariable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Albertine preserved, inseparably attached to her, all my impressions of a series of seascapes of which I was particularly fond. I felt that it was possible for me, on the girl\u2019s two cheeks, to kiss the whole of the beach at Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you really don\u2019t mind my kissing you, I would rather put it off for a little and choose a good moment. Only you mustn\u2019t forget that you\u2019ve said I may. I shall want a voucher: \u2018Valid for one kiss.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShall I have to sign it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut if I took it now, should I be entitled to another later on?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou do make me laugh with your vouchers; I shall issue a new one every now and then.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me; just one thing more. You know, at Balbec, before I had been introduced to you, you used often to have a hard, calculating look; you can\u2019t tell me what you were thinking about when you looked like that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; I don\u2019t remember at all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait; this may remind you: one day your friend Gis\u00e8le put her feet together and jumped over the chair an old gentleman was sitting in. Try to remember what was in your mind at that moment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGis\u00e8le was the one we saw least of; she did belong to the band, I suppose, but not properly. I expect I thought that she was very ill-bred and common.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, is that all?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should certainly have liked, before kissing her, to be able to fill her afresh with the mystery which she had had for me on the beach before I knew her, to find latent in her the place in which she had lived earlier still; for that, at any rate, if I knew nothing of it, I could substitute all my memories of our life at Balbec, the sound of the waves rolling up and breaking beneath my window, the shouts of the children. But when I let my eyes glide over the charming pink globe of her cheeks, the gently curving surfaces of which ran up to expire beneath the first foothills of her piled black tresses which ran in undulating mountain chains, thrust out escarped ramparts and moulded the hollows of deep valleys, I could not help saying to myself: \u201cNow at last, after failing at Balbec, I am going to learn the fragrance of the secret rose that blooms in Albertine\u2019s cheeks, and, since the cycles through which we are able to make things and people pass in the course of our existence are comparatively few, perhaps I ought now to regard mine as nearing its end when, having made to emerge from its remoteness the flowering face that I had chosen from among all others, I shall have brought it into this new plane in which I shall at last acquire a tactual experience of it with my lips.\u201d I told myself this because I believed that there was such a thing as knowledge acquired by the lips; I told myself that I was going to know the taste of this fleshly rose, because I had never stopped to think that man, a creature obviously less rudimentary in structure than the sea-urchin or even the whale, is nevertheless still unprovided with a certain number of essential organs, and notably possesses none that will serve for kissing. The place of this absent organ he supplies with his lips, and thereby arrives perhaps at a slightly more satisfying result than if he were reduced to caressing the beloved with a horny tusk. But a pair of lips, designed to convey to the palate the taste of whatever whets the appetite, must be content, without ever realising their mistake or admitting their disappointment, with roaming over the surface and with coming to a halt at the barrier of the impenetrable but irresistible cheek. Besides, at such moments, at the actual contact between flesh and flesh, the lips, even supposing them to become more expert and better endowed, could taste no better probably the savour which nature prevents their ever actually grasping, for in that desolate zone in which they are unable to find their proper nourishment, they are alone; the sense of sight, then that of smell have long since deserted them. To begin with, as my mouth began gradually to approach the cheeks which my eyes had suggested to it that it should kiss, my eyes, changing their position, saw a different pair of cheeks; the throat, studied at closer range and as though through a magnifying glass shewed in its coarse grain a robustness which modified the character of the face\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from the most recent applications of the art of photography \u2014 which set crouching at the foot of a cathedral all the houses which, time and again, when we stood near them, have appeared to us to reach almost to the height of the towers, drill and deploy like a regiment, in file, in open order, in mass, the same famous and familiar structures, bring into actual contact the two columns on the Piazzetta which a moment ago were so far apart, thrust away the adjoining dome of the Salute, and in a pale and toneless background manage to include a whole immense horizon within the span of a bridge, in the embrasure of a window, among the leaves of a tree that stands in the foreground and is portrayed in a more vigorous tone, give successively as setting to the same church the arched walls of all the others \u2014 I can think of nothing that can so effectively as a kiss evoke from what we believe to be a thing with one definite aspect, the hundred other things which it may equally well be since each is related to a view of it no less legitimate. In short, just as at Balbec Albertine had often appeared to me different, so now, as if, wildly accelerating the speed of the changes of aspect and changes of colouring which a person presents to us in the course of our various encounters, I had sought to contain them all in the space of a few seconds so as to reproduce experimentally the phenomenon which diversifies the individuality of a fellow creature, and to draw out one from another, like a nest of boxes, all the possibilities that it contains, in this brief passage of my lips towards her cheek it was ten Albertines that I saw; this single girl being like a goddess with several heads, that which I had last seen, if I tried to approach it, gave place to another. At least so long as I had not touched it, that head, I could still see it, a faint perfume reached me from it. But alas \u2014 for in this matter of kissing our nostrils and eyes are as ill placed as our lips are shaped \u2014 suddenly my eyes ceased to see; next, my nose, crushed by the collision, no longer perceived any fragrance, and, without thereby gaining any clearer idea of the taste of the rose of my desire, I learned, from these unpleasant signs, that at last I was in the act of kissing Albertine\u2019s cheek\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it because we were enacting \u2014 as may be illustrated by the rotation of a solid body \u2014 the converse of our scene together at Balbec, because it was I, now, who was lying in bed and she who sat beside me, capable of evading any brutal attack and of dictating her pleasure to me, that she allowed me to take so easily now what she had refused me on the former occasion with so forbidding a frown? (No doubt from that same frown the voluptuous expression which her face assumed now at the approach of my lips differed only by a deviation of its lines immeasurably minute but one in which may be contained all the disparity that there is between the gesture of \u2018finishing off\u2019 a wounded man and that of bringing him relief, between a sublime and a hideous portrait.) Not knowing whether I had to give the credit, and to feel grateful for this change of attitude to some unwitting benefactor who in these last months, in Paris or at Balbec, had been working on my behalf, I supposed that the respective positions in which we were now placed might account for it. It was quite another explanation, however, that Albertine offered me; this, in short: \u201cOh, well, you see, that time at Balbec I didn\u2019t know you properly. For all I knew, you might have meant mischief.\u201d This argument left me in perplexity. Albertine was no doubt sincere in advancing it. So difficult is it for a woman to recognise in the movements of her limbs, in the sensations felt by her body in the course of an intimate conversation with a friend, the unknown sin into which she would tremble to think that a stranger was planning her fall\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any case, whatever the modifications that had occurred at some recent time in her life, which might perhaps have explained why it was that she now readily accorded to my momentary and purely physical desire what at Balbec she had with horror refused to allow to my love, another far more surprising manifested itself in Albertine that same evening as soon as her caresses had procured in me the satisfaction which she could not have failed to notice, which, indeed, I had been afraid might provoke in her the instinctive movement of revulsion and offended modesty which Gilberte had given at a corresponding moment behind the laurel shrubbery in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The exact opposite happened. Already, when I had first made her lie on my bed and had begun to fondle her, Albertine had assumed an air which I did not remember in her, of docile good will, of an almost childish simplicity. Obliterating every trace of her customary anxieties and interests, the moment preceding pleasure, similar in this respect to the moment after death, had restored to her rejuvenated features what seemed like the innocence of earliest childhood. And no doubt everyone whose special talent is suddenly brought into play becomes modest, devoted, charming; especially if by this talent he knows that he is giving us a great pleasure, he is himself happy in the display of it, anxious to present it to us in as complete a form as possible. But in this new expression on Albertine\u2019s face there was more than a mere profession of disinterestedness, conscience, generosity, a sort of conventional and unexpected devotion; and it was farther than to her own childhood, it was to the infancy of the race that she had reverted. Very different from myself who had looked for nothing more than a physical alleviation, which I had finally secured, Albertine seemed to feel that it would indicate a certain coarseness on her part were she to seem to believe that this material pleasure could be unaccompanied by a moral sentiment or was to be regarded as terminating anything. She, who had been in so great a hurry a moment ago, now, presumably because she felt that kisses implied love and that love took precedence of all other duties, said when I reminded her of her dinner:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but that doesn\u2019t matter in the least; I have plenty of time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She seemed embarrassed by the idea of getting up and going immediately after what had happened, embarrassed by good manners, just as Fran\u00e7oise when, without feeling thirsty, she had felt herself bound to accept with a seemly gaiety the glass of wine which Jupien offered her, would never have dared to leave him as soon as the last drops were drained, however urgent the call of duty. Albertine \u2014 and this was perhaps, with another which the reader will learn in due course, one of the reasons which bad made me unconsciously desire her \u2014 was one of the incarnations of the little French peasant whose type may be seen in stone at Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs. As in Fran\u00e7oise, who presently nevertheless was to become her deadly enemy, I recognised in her a courtesy towards friend and stranger, a sense of decency, of respect for the bedside\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise who, after the death of my aunt, felt obliged to speak only in a plaintive tone, would, in the months that preceded her daughter\u2019s marriage, have been quite shocked if, when the young couple walked out together, the girl had not taken her lover\u2019s arm. Albertine lying motionless beside me said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat nice hair you have; what nice eyes; you are a dear boy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, after pointing out to her that it was getting late, I added: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d she replied, what was perhaps true but could be so only since the minute before and for the next few hours:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI always believe you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She spoke to me of myself, my family, my social position. She said: \u201cOh, I know your parents know some very nice people. You are a friend of Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage.\u201d For the moment these names conveyed absolutely nothing to me. But suddenly I remembered that I had indeed played as a child in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es with Robert Forestier, whom I had never seen since then. As for Suzanne Delage, she was the great-niece of Mme. Blatin, and I had once been going to a dancing lesson, and had even promised to take a small part in a play that was being acted in her mother\u2019s drawing-room. But the fear of being sent into fits of laughter, and of a bleeding nose, had made me decline, so that I had never set eyes on her. I had at the most a vague idea that I had once heard that the Swanns\u2019 governess with the feather in her hat had at one time been with the Delages, but perhaps it was only a sister of this governess, or a friend. I protested to Albertine that Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage occupied a very small place in my life. \u201cThat may be; but your mothers are friends, I can place you by that. I often pass Suzanne Delage in the Avenue de Messine, I admire her style.\u201d Our mothers were acquainted only in the imagination of Mme. Bontemps, who having heard that I had at one time played with Robert Forestier, to whom, it appeared, I used to recite poetry, had concluded from that that we were bound by family ties. She could never, I gathered, hear my mother\u2019s name mentioned without observing: \u201cOh, yes, she is in the Delage Forestier set,\u201d giving my parents a good mark which they had done nothing to deserve\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from this, Albertine\u2019s social ideas were fatuous in the extreme. She regarded the Simonnets with a double \u2018n\u2019 as inferior not only to the Simonets with a single \u2018n\u2019 but to everyone in the world. That some one else should bear the same name as yourself without belonging to your family is an excellent reason for despising him. Of course there are exceptions. It may happen that two Simonnets (introduced to one another at one of those gatherings where one feels the need to converse, no matter on what subject, and where moreover one is instinctively well disposed towards strangers, for instance in a funeral procession on its way to the cemetery), finding that they have the same name, will seek with a mutual friendliness though without success to discover a possible connexion. But that is only an exception. Plenty of people are of dubious character, but we either know nothing or care nothing about them. If, however, a similarity of names brings to our door letters addressed to them, or vice versa, we at once feel a mistrust, often justified, as to their moral worth. We are afraid of being confused with them, we forestall the mistake by a grimace of disgust when anyone refers to them in our hearing. When we read our own name, as borne by them, in the newspaper, they seem to have usurped it. The transgressions of other members of the social organism leave us cold. We lay the burden of them more heavily upon our namesakes. The hatred which we bear towards the other Simonnets is all the stronger in that it is not a personal feeling but has been transmitted by heredity. After the second generation we remember only the expression of disgust with which our grandparents used to refer to the other Simonnets, we know nothing of the reason, we should not be surprised to learn that it had begun with a murder. Until, as is not uncommon, the time comes when a male and female Simonnet, who are not related in any way, are joined together in matrimony and so repair the breach\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only did Albertine speak to me of Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage, but spontaneously, with that impulse to confide which the approximation of two human bodies creates, that is to say at first, before it has engendered a special duplicity and reticence in one person towards the other, she told me a story about her own family and one of Andr\u00e9e\u2019s uncles, as to which, at Balbec, she had refused to utter a word; thinking that now she ought not to appear to have any secrets in which I might not share. From this moment, had her dearest friend said anything to her against me, she would have made it her duty to inform me. I insisted upon her going home, and finally she did go, but so ashamed on my account at my discourtesy that she laughed almost as though to apologise for me, as a hostess to whose party you have gone without dressing makes the best of you but is offended nevertheless\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAre you laughing at me?\u201d I inquired\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am not laughing, I am smiling at you,\u201d she replied lovingly. \u201cWhen am I going to see you again?\u201d she went on, as though declining to admit that what had just happened between us, since it is generally the crowning consummation, might not be at least the prelude to a great friendship, a friendship already existing which we should have to discover, to confess, and which alone could account for the surrender we had made of ourselves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSince you give me leave, I shall send for you when I can.\u201d I dared not let her know that I was subordinating everything else to the chance of seeing Mme. de Stermaria. \u201cIt will have to be at short notice, unfortunately,\u201d I went on, \u201cI never know beforehand. Would it be possible for me to send round for you in the evenings, when I am free?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt will be quite possible in a little while, I am going to have a latch-key of my own. But just at present it can\u2019t be done. Anyhow I shall come round to-morrow or next day in the afternoon. You needn\u2019t see me if you\u2019re busy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On reaching the door, surprised that I had not anticipated her, she offered me her cheek, feeling that there was no need now for any coarse physical desire to prompt us to kiss one another. The brief relations in which we had just indulged being of the sort to which an absolute intimacy and a heartfelt choice often tend, Albertine had felt it incumbent upon her to improvise and add provisionally to the kisses which we had exchanged on my bed the sentiment of which those kisses would have been the symbol for a knight and his lady such as they might have been conceived in the mind of a gothic minstrel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When she had left me, this young Picard, who might have been carved on his porch by the image-maker of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, Fran\u00e7oise brought me a letter which filled me with joy, for it was from Mme. de Stermaria, who accepted my invitation to dinner. From Mme. de Stermaria, that was to say for me not so much from the real Mme. de Stermaria as from her of whom I had been thinking all day before Albertine\u2019s arrival. It is the terrible deception of love that it begins by engaging us in play not with a woman of the external world but with a puppet fashioned and kept in our brain, the only form of her moreover that we have always at our disposal, the only one that we shall ever possess, one which the arbitrary power of memory, almost as absolute as that of imagination, may have made as different from the real woman as had been from the real Balbec the Balbec of my dreams; an artificial creation to which by degrees, and to our own hurt, we shall force the real woman into resemblance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine had made me so late that the play had just finished when I entered Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room; and having little desire to be caught in the stream of guests who were pouring out, discussing the great piece of news, the separation, said to be already effected, of the Duc de Guermantes from his wife, I had, until I should have an opportunity of shaking hands with my hostess, taken my seat on an empty sofa in the outer room, when from the other, in which she had no doubt had her chair in the very front row of all, I saw emerging, majestic, ample and tall in a flowing gown of yellow satin upon which stood out in relief huge black poppies, the Duchess herself. The sight of her no longer disturbed me in the least. There had been a day when, laying her hands on my forehead (as was her habit when she was afraid of hurting my feelings) and saying: \u201cYou really must stop hanging about trying to meet Mme. de Guermantes. All the neighbours are talking about you. Besides, look how ill your grandmother is, you really have something more serious to think about than waylaying a woman who only laughs at you,\u201d in a moment, like a hypnotist who brings one back from the distant country in which one imagined oneself to be, and opens one\u2019s eyes for one, or like the doctor who, by recalling one to a sense of duty and reality, cures one of an imaginary disease in which one has been indulging one\u2019s fancy, my mother had awakened me from an unduly protracted dream. The rest of the day had been consecrated to a last farewell to this malady which I was renouncing; I had sung, for hours on end and weeping as I sang, the sad words of Schubert\u2019s Adieu:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Farewell, strange voices call thee\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Away from me, dear sister of the angels\n\nAnd then it had finished. I had given up my morning walks, and with so little difficulty that I thought myself justified in the prophecy (which we shall see was to prove false later on) that I should easily grow accustomed in the course of my life to ceasing to see a woman. And when, shortly afterwards, Fran\u00e7oise had reported to me that Jupien, anxious to enlarge his business, was looking for a shop in the neighbourhood, wishing to find one for him (quite happy, moreover, when strolling along a street which already from my bed I had heard luminously vociferous like a peopled beach, to see behind the raised iron shutters of the dairies the young milk-girls with their white sleeves), I had been able to begin these excursions again. Nor did I feel the slightest constraint; for I was conscious that I was no longer going out with the object of seeing Mme. de Guermantes; much as a married woman who takes endless precautions so long as she has a lover, from the day on which she has broken with him leaves his letters lying about, at the risk of disclosing to her husband an infidelity which ceased to alarm her the moment she ceased to be guilty of it. What troubled me now was the discovery that almost every house sheltered some unhappy person. In one the wife was always in tears because her husband was unfaithful to her. In the next it was the other way about. In another a hardworking mother, beaten black and blue by a drunkard son, was endeavouring to conceal her sufferings from the eyes of the neighbours. Quite half of the human race was in tears. And when I came to know the people who composed it I saw that they were so exasperating that I asked myself whether it might not be the adulterous husband and wife (who were so simply because their lawful happiness had been withheld from them, and shewed themselves charming and faithful to everyone but their respective wife and husband) who were in the right. Presently I ceased to have even the excuse of being useful to Jupien for continuing my morning wanderings. For we learned that the cabinet-maker in our courtyard, whose workrooms were separated from Jupien\u2019s shop only by the flimsiest of partitions, was shortly to be \u2018given notice\u2019 by the Duke\u2019s agent because his hammering made too much noise. Jupien could have hoped for nothing better; the workrooms had a basement for storing timber, which communicated with our cellars. He could keep his coal in this, he could knock down the partition, and would then have a huge shop all in one room. But even without the amusement of house-hunting on his behalf I had continued to go out every day before luncheon, just as Jupien himself, finding the rent that M. de Guermantes was asking him exorbitant, was allowing the premises to be inspected in the hope that,discouraged by his failure to find a tenant, the Duke would resign himself to accepting a lower offer. Fran\u00e7oise, noticing that, even at an hour when no prospective tenant was likely to call, the porter left the door of the empty shop on the latch, scented a trap laid by him to entice the young woman who was engaged to the Guer \u2014 mantes footman (they would find a lovers\u2019 retreat there) and to catch them red-handed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However that might be, and for all that I had no longer to find Jupien a new shop, I still went out before luncheon. Often, on these excursions, I met M. de Norpois. It would happen that, conversing as he walked with a colleague, he cast at me a glance which after making a thorough scrutiny of my person returned to his companion without his having smiled at me or given me any more sign of recognition than if he had never set eyes on me before. For, with these eminent diplomats, looking at you in a certain way is intended to let you know not that they have seen you but that they have not seen you and that they have some serious question to discuss with the colleague who is accompanying them. A tall woman whom I frequently encountered near the house was less discreet with me. For in spite of the fact that I did not know her, she would turn round to look at me, would wait for me, unavailingly, before shop windows, smile at me as though she were going to kiss me, make gestures indicative of a complete surrender. She resumed an icy coldness towards me if anyone appeared whom she knew. For a long time now in these morning walks, thinking only of what I had to do, were it but the most trivial purchase of a newspaper, I had chosen the shortest way, with no regret were it outside the ordinary course which the Duchess followed in her walks, and if on the other hand it lay along that course, without either compunction or concealment, because it no longer appeared to me the forbidden way on which I should snatch from an ungrateful woman the favour of setting eyes on her against her will. But it had never occurred to me that my recovery, when it restored me to a normal attitude towards Mme. de Guermantes, would have a corresponding effect on her, and so render possible a friendliness, even a friendship in which I no longer felt any interest. Until then, the efforts of the entire world banded together to bring me into touch with her would have been powerless to counteract the evil spell that is cast by an ill-starred love. Fairies more powerful than mankind have decreed that in such cases nothing can avail us until the day on which we have uttered sincerely and from our hearts the formula: \u201cI am no longer in love.\u201d I had been vexed with Saint-Loup for not having taken me to see his aunt. But he was no more capable than anyone else of breaking an enchantment. So long as I was in love with Mme. de Guermantes, the marks of politeness that \u00ef received from others, their compliments actually distressed me, not only because they did not come from her but because she would never hear of them. And yet even if she had known of them it would not have been of the slightest use to me. Indeed, among the lesser auxiliaries to success in iove, an absence, the declining of an invitation to dinner, an unintentional, unconscious harshness are of more service than all the cosmetics and fine clothes in the world. There would be plenty of social success, were people taught upon these lines the art of succeeding\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she swept through the room in which I was sitting, her mind filled with thoughts of friends whom I did not know and whom she would perhaps be meeting presently at some other party, Mme. de Guermantes caught sight of me on my sofa, genuinely indifferent and seeking only to be polite whereas while I was in love I had tried so desperately, without ever succeeding, to assume an air of indifference; she swerved aside, came towards me and, reproducing the smile she had worn that evening at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, which the unpleasant feeling of being cared for by some one for whom she did not care was no longer there to obliterate: \u201cNo, don\u2019t move; you don\u2019t mind if I sit down beside you for a moment?\u201d she asked, gracefully gathering in her immense skirt which otherwise would have covered the entire sofa\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of less stature than she, who was further expanded by the volume of her gown, I was almost brushed by her exquisite bare arm round which a faint, innumerable down rose in perpetual smoke like a golden mist, and by the fringe of her fair tresses which wafted their fragrance over me. Having barely room to sit down, she could not turn easily to face me, and so obliged to look straight before her rather than in my direction, assumed the sort of dreamy, sweet expression one sees in a portrait\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you any news of Robert?\u201d she inquired\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment Mme. de Villeparisis entered the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, Sir, you arrive at a fine time, when we do see you here for once in a way!\u201d And noticing that I was talking to her niece, concluding, perhaps, that we were more intimate than she had supposed: \u201cBut don\u2019t let me interrupt your conversation with Oriane,\u201d she went on, and (for these good offices as pander are part of the duties of the perfect hostess): \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t care to dine with her here on Thursday?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was the day on which I was to entertain Mme. de Stermaria, so I declined\n\u201cSaturday, then?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As my mother was returning on Saturday or Sunday, it would never do for me not to stay at home every evening to dine with her; I therefore declined this invitation also\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, you\u2019re not an easy person to get hold of.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy do you never come to see me?\u201d inquired Mme. de Guermantes when Mme. de Villeparisis had left us to go and congratulate the performers and present the leading lady with a bunch of roses upon which the hand that offered it conferred all its value, for it had cost no more than twenty francs. (This, incidentally, was as high as she ever went when an artist had performed only once. Those who gave their services at all her afternoons and evenings throughout the season received roses painted by the Marquise.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s such a bore that we never see each other except in other people\u2019s houses. Since you won\u2019t meet me at dinner at my aunt\u2019s, why not come and dine with me?\u201d Various people who had stayed to the last possible moment, upon one pretext or another, but were at length preparing to leave, seeing that the Duchess had sat down to talk to a young man on a seat so narrow as just to contain them both, thought that they must have been misinformed, that it was the Duchess, and not the Duke, who was seeking a separation, and on my account. Whereupon they hastened to spread abroad this intelligence. I had better grounds than anyone to be aware of its falsehood. But I was myself surprised that at one of those difficult periods in which a separation that is not yet completed is beginning to take effect, the Duchess, instead of withdrawing from society should go out of her way to invite a \u2014 person whom she knew so slightly. The suspicion crossed my mind that it had been the Duke alone who had been opposed to her having me in the house, and that now that he was leaving her she saw no further obstacle to her surrounding herself with the people that she liked\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A minute earlier I should have been stupefied had anyone told me that Mme. de Guermantes was going to ask me to call on her, let alone to dine with her. I might be perfectly aware that the Guermantes drawing-room could not furnish those particular refinements which I had extracted from the name of its occupants, the fact that it had been forbidden ground to me, by obliging me to give it the same kind of existence that we give to the drawing-rooms of which we have read the description in a novel, or seen the image in a dream, made me, even when I was certain that it was just like any other, imagine it as quite different. Between myself and it was the barrier at which reality ends. To dine with the Guermantes was like travelling to a place I had long wished to see, making a desire emerge from my brain and take shape before my eyes, forming acquaintance with a dream. At the most, I might have supposed that it would be one of those dinners to which one\u2019s hosts invite one with: \u201cDo come; there\u2019ll beabsolutely nobody but ourselves,\u201d pretending to attribute to the pariah the alarm which they themselves feel at the thought of his mixing with their other friends, seeking indeed to convert into an enviable privilege, reserved for their intimates alone, the quarantine of the outsider, hopelessly uncouth, whom they are befriending. I felt on the contrary that Mme. de Guermantes was anxious for me to enjoy the most delightful society that she had to offer me when she went on, projecting as she spoke before my eyes as it were the violet-hued loveliness of a visit to Fabrice\u2019s aunt with the miracle of an introduction to Count Mosca:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOn Friday, now, couldn\u2019t you? There are just a few people coming; the Princesse de Parme, who is charming, not that I\u2019d ask you to meet anyone who wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discarded in the intermediate social grades which are engaged in a perpetual upward movement, the family still plays an important part in certain stationary grades, such as the lower middle class and the semi-royal aristocracy, which latter cannot seek to raise itself since above it, from its own special point of view, there exists nothing higher. The friendship shewn me by her \u2018aunt Villeparisis\u2019 and Robert had perhaps made me, for Mme. de Guermantes and her friends, living always upon themselves and in the same little circle, the object of a curious interest of which I had no suspicion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had of those two relatives a familiar, everyday, homely knowledge, of a sort, utterly different from what we imagine, in which if we happen to be comprised in it, so far from our actions being at once ejected, like the grain of dust from the eye or the drop of water from the windpipe, they are capable of remaining engraved, and will still be related and discussed years after we ourselves have forgotten them, in the palace in which we are astonished to find them preserved, like a letter in our own handwriting among a priceless collection of autographs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People who are merely fashionable may set a guard upon doors which are too freely invalided. But the Guermantes door was not that. Hardly ever did a stranger have occasion to pass by it. If, for once in a way, the Duchess had one pointed out to her, she never dreamed of troubling herself about the social increment that he would bring, since this was a thing that she conferred and could not receive. She thought only of his real merits. Both Mme. de Villeparisis and Saint-Loup had testified to mine Doubtless she might not have believed them if she had not at the same time observed that they could never manage to secure me when they wanted me, and therefore that I attached no importance to worldly things, which seemed to the Duchess a sign that the stranger was to be numbered among what she called \u2018nice people.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was worth seeing, when one spoke to her of women for whom she did not care, how her face changed as soon as one named, in connexion with one of these, let us say, her sister-in-law. \u201cOh, she is charming!\u201d the Duchess would exclaim in a judicious, confident tone. The only reason that she gave was that this lady had declined to be introduced to the Marquise de Chaussegros and the Princesse de Silistrie. She did not add that the lady had declined also an introduction to herself, the Duchesse de Guermantes. This had, nevertheless, been the case, and ever since the mind of the Duchess had been at work trying to unravel the motives of a woman who was so hard to know, she was dying to be invited to call on her. People in society are so accustomed to be sought after that the person who shuns them seems to them a phoenix and at once monopolises their attention. Was the true motive in the mind of Mme. de Guermantes for thus inviting me (now that I was no longer in love with her) that I did not run after her relatives, although apparently run after myself by them? I cannot say. In any case, having made up her mind to invite me, she was anxious to do me the honours of the best company at her disposal and to keep away those of her friends whose presence might have dissuaded me from coming again, those whom she knew to be boring. I had not known to what to attribute her change of direction, when I had seen her deviate from her stellar path, come to sit down beside me and had heard her invite me to dinner, the effect of causes unknown for want of a special sense to enlighten us in this respect. We picture to ourselves the people who know us but slightly \u2014 such as, in my case, the Duchesse de Guermantes \u2014 as thinking of us only at the rare moments at which they set eyes on us. As a matter of fact this ideal oblivion in which we picture them as holding us is a purely arbitrary conception on our part. So that while, in our solitary silence, like that of a cloudless night, we imagine the various queens of society pursuing their course in the heavens at an infinite distance, we cannot help an involuntary start of dismay or pleasure if there falls upon us from that starry height, like a meteorite engraved with our name which we supposed to be unknown on Venus or Cassiopeia, an invitation to dinner or a piece of malicious gossip\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps now and then when, following the example of the Persian princes who, according to the Book of Esther, made their scribes read out to them the registers in which were enrolled the names of those of their subjects who had shewn zeal in their service, Mme. de Guermantes consulted her list of the well-disposed, she had said to herself, on coming to my name: \u201cA man we must ask to dine some day.\u201d But other thoughts had distracted her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Beset by surging cares, a Prince\u2019s mind\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Towards fresh matters ever is inclined)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0until the moment when she had caught sight of me sitting alone like Mordecai at the palace gate; and, the sight of me having refreshed her memory, sought, like Ahasuerus, to lavish her gifts upon me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I must at the same time add that a surprise of a totally different sort was to follow that which I had felt on hearing Mme. de Guermantes ask me to dine with her. Since I had decided that it would shew greater modesty, on my part, and gratitude also not to conceal this initial surprise, but rather to exaggerate my expression of the delight that it gave me, Mme. de Guermantes, who was getting ready to go on to another, final party, had said to me, almost as a justification and for fear of my not being quite certain who she was, since I appeared so astonished at being invited to dine with her: \u201cYou know I\u2019m the aunt of Robert de Saint-Loup, who is such a friend of yours; besides we have met before.\u201d In replying that I was aware of this I added that I knew also M. de Charlus, \u201cwho had been very good to me at Balbec and in Paris.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes appeared dumbfoundered, and her eyes seemed to turn, as though for a verification of this statement, to some page, already filled and turned, of her internal register of events. \u201cWhat, so you know Palam\u00e8de, do you?\u201d This name assumed on the lips of Mme. de Guermantes a great charm, due to the instinctive simplicity with which she spoke of a man who was socially so brilliant a figure, but for her was no more than her brother-in-law and the cousin with whom she had grown up. And on the confused greyness which the life of the Duchesse de Guermantes was for me this name, Palam\u00e8de, shed as it were the radiance of long summer days on which she had played with him as a girl, at Guermantes, in the garden. Moreover, in this long outgrown period in their lives, Oriane de Guermantes and her cousin Palam\u00e8de had been very different from what they had since become; M. de Charlus in particular, entirely absorbed in the artistic pursuits from which he had so effectively restrained himself in later life that I was stupefied to learn that it was he who had painted the huge fan with black and yellow irises which the Duchess was at this moment unfurling. She could also have shewn me a little sonatina which he had once composed for her. I was completely unaware that the Baron possessed all these talents, of which he never spoke. Let me remark in passing that M. de Charlus did not at all relish being called \u2018Palam\u00e8de\u2019 by his family. That the form \u2018M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2019 might not please him one could easily understand. These stupid abbreviations are a sign of the utter inability of the aristocracy to appreciate its own Poetic beauty (in Jewry, too, we may see the same defect, since a nephew of Lady Israels, whose name was Moses, was commonly known as \u2018Momo\u2019) concurrently with its anxiety not to appear to attach any importance to what is aristocratic. Now M. de Charlus had, in this connexion, a greater wealth of poetic imagination and a more blatant pride. But the reason for his distaste for \u2018M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2019 could not be this, since it extended also to the fine name Palam\u00e8de. The truth was that, considering, knowing himself to come of a princely stock, he would have liked his brother and sister-in-law to refer to him as \u2018Charlus,\u2019 just as Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans might have spoken of their sons and grandsons, brothers and nephews as \u2018Joinville, Nemours, Chartres, Paris.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a humbug M\u00e9m\u00e9 is!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWe talked to him about you for hours; he told us that he would be delighted to make your acquaintance, just as if he had never set eyes on you. You must admit he\u2019s odd, and \u2014 though it\u2019s not very nice of me to say such a thing about a brother-in-law I\u2019m devoted to, and really do admire immensely \u2014 a trifle mad at times.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was struck by the application of this last epithet to M. de Charlus, and said to myself that this half-madness might perhaps account for certain things, such as his having appeared so delighted by his own proposal that I should ask Bloch to castigate his mother. I decided that, by reason not only of the things he said but of the way in which he said them, M. de Charlus must be a little mad. The first time that one listens to a barrister or an actor, one is surprised by his tone, so different from the conversational. But, observing that everyone else seems to find this quite natural, one says nothing about it to other people, one says nothing in fact to oneself, one is content with appreciating the degree of talent shewn. At the most, one may think, of an actor at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais: \u201cWhy, instead of letting his raised arm fall naturally, did he make it drop in a series of little jerks broken by pauses for at least ten minutes?\u201d or of a Labori: \u201cWhy, whenever he opened his mouth, did he utter those tragic, unexpected sounds to express the simplest things?\u201d But as everybody admits these actions to be necessary and obvious one is not shocked by them. So, upon thinking it over, one said to oneself that M. de Charlus spoke of himself with undue emphasis in a tone which was not in the least that of ordinary speech. It seemed as though one might have at any moment interrupted him with: \u201cBut why do you shout so? Why are you so offensive?\u201d only everyone seemed to have tacitly agreed that it was all right. And one took one\u2019s place in the circle which applauded his outbursts. But certainly, at certain moments, a stranger might have thought that he was listening to the ravings of a maniac\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut are you sure you\u2019re not thinking of some one else? Do you really mean my brother-in-law Palam\u00e8de?\u201d went on the Duchess, a trace of impertinence grafted upon her natural simplicity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I replied that I was absolutely sure, and that M. de Charlus must have failed to catch my name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh well! I shall leave you now,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, as though she regretted the parting. \u201cI must look in for a moment at the Princesse de Ligne\u2019s. You aren\u2019t going on there? No? You don\u2019t care for parties? You\u2019re very wise, they are too boring for words. If only I hadn\u2019t got to go. But she\u2019s my cousin; it wouldn\u2019t be polite. I am sorry, selfishly, for my own sake, because I could have taken you there, and brought you back afterwards, too. So I shall say good-bye now, and look forward to Friday.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That M. de Charlus should have blushed to be seen with me by M. d\u2019Argencourt was all very well. But that to his own sister-in-law, who had so high an opinion of him besides, he should deny all knowledge of me, knowledge which was perfectly natural seeing that I was a friend of both his aunt and his nephew, was a thing that I could not understand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I shall end my account of this incident with the remark that from one point of view there was in Mme. de Guermantes a true greatness which consisted in her entirely obliterating from her memory what other people would have only partially forgotten. Had she never seen me waylaying her, following her, tracking her down as she took her morning walks, had she never responded to my daily salute with an angry impatience, had she never refused Saint-Loup when he begged her to invite me to her house, she could not have greeted me now in a nobler or more gracious manner. Not only did she waste no time in retrospective explanations, in hints, allusions or ambiguous smiles, not only was there in her present affability, without any harking back to the past, without any reticence, something as proudly rectilinear as her majestic stature, but the resentment which she might have felt against anyone in the past was so entirely reduced to ashes, the ashes were themselves cast so utterly from her memory, or at least from her manner, that on studying her face whenever she had occasion to treat with the most exquisite simplification what in so many other people would have been a pretext for reviving stale antipathies and recriminations one had the impression of an intense purity of mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if I was surprised by the modification that had occurred in her opinion of me, how much more did it surprise me to find a similar but ever so much greater change in my feeling for her. Had there not been a time during which I could regain life and strength only if \u2014 always building new castles in the air! \u2014 I had found some one who would obtain for me an invitation to her house and, after this initial boon, would procure many others for my increasingly exacting heart? It was the impossibility of finding any avenue there that had made me leave Paris for Donci\u00e8res to visit Robert de Saint-Loup. And now it was indeed by the consequence of a letter from him that I was agitated, but on account this time of Mme. de Stermaria, not of Mme. de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let me add further, to conclude my account of this party, that there Occurred at it an incident, contradicted a few days later, which continued to puzzle me, interrupted for some time my friendship with Bloch, and constitutes in itself one of those curious paradoxes the explanation of which will be found in the next part of this work. At this party at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, Bloch kept on boasting to me about the friendly attentions shewn him by M. de Charlus, who, when he passed him in the street, looked him straight in the face as though he recognised him, was anxious to know him personally, knew quite well who he was. I smiled at first, Bloch having expressed so vehemently at Balbec his contempt for the said M. de Charlus. And I supposed merely that Bloch, like his father in the Case of Bergotte, knew the Baron \u2018without actually knowing him,\u2019 and that what he took for a friendly glance was due to absent-mindedness. But finally Bloch became so precise and appeared so confident that on two or three occasions M. de Charlus had wished to address him that, remembering that I had spoken of my friend to the Baron, who had, as we walked away together from this very house, as it happened, asked me various questions about him, I came to the conclusion that Bloch was not lying that M. de Charlus had heard his name, realised that he was my friend\u2019 and so forth. And so, a little later, at the theatre one evening, I asked M! de Charlus if I might introduce Bloch to him, and, on his assenting, went in search of my friend. But as soon as M. de Charlus caught sight of him an expression of astonishment, instantly repressed, appeared on his face where it gave way to a blazing fury. Not only did he not offer Bloch his hand but whenever Bloch spoke to him he replied in the most insolent manner, in an angry and wounding tone. So that Bloch, who, according to his version, had received nothing until then from the Baron but smiles, assumed that I had not indeed commended but disparaged him in the short speech in which, knowing M. de Charlus\u2019s liking for formal procedure, I had told him about my friend before bringing him up to be introduced. Bloch left us, his spirit broken, like a man who has been trying to mount a horse which is always ready to take the bit in its teeth, or to swim against waves which continually dash him back on the shingle, and did not speak to me again for six months\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The days that preceded my dinner with Mme. de Stermaria were for me by no means delightful, in fact it was all I could do to live through them. For as a general rule, the shorter the interval is that separates us from our planned objective, the longer it seems to us, because we apply to it a more minute scale of measurement, or simply because it occurs to us to measure it at all. The Papacy, we are told, reckons by centuries, and indeed may not think perhaps of reckoning time at all, since its goal is in eternity. Mine was no more than three days off; I counted by seconds, I gave myself up to those imaginings which are the first movements of caresses, of caresses which it maddens us not to be able to make the woman herself reciprocate and complete \u2014 those identical caresses, to the exclusion of all others. And, as a matter of fact, it is true that, generally speaking, the difficulty of attaining to the object of a desire enhances that desire (the difficulty, not the impossibility, for that suppresses it altogether), yet in the case of a desire that is wholly physical the certainty that it will be realised, at a fixed and not distant point in time, is scarcely less exciting than uncertainty; almost as much as an anxious doubt, the absence of doubt makes intolerable the period of waiting for the pleasure that is bound to come, because it makes of that suspense an innumerably rehearsed accomplishment and by the frequency of our proleptic representations divides time into sections as minute as could be carved by agony. What I required was to possess Mme. de Stermaria, for during the last few days, with an incessant activity, my desires had been preparing this pleasure, in my imagination, and this pleasure alone, for any other kind (pleasure, that is, taken with another woman) would not have been ready, pleasure being but the realisation of a previous wish, and of one which is not always the same, but changes according to the endless combinations of one\u2019s fancies, the accidents of one\u2019s memory, the state of one\u2019s temperament, the variability of one\u2019s desires, the most recently granted of which lie dormant until the disappointment of their satisfaction has been to some extent forgotten; I should not have been prepared, I had already turned from the main road of general desires and had ventured along the bridle-path of a particular desire; I should have had \u2014 in order to wish for a different assignation \u2014 to retrace my steps too far before rejoining the main road and taking another path. To take possession of Mme. de Stermaria on the island in the Bois de Boulogne where I had asked her to dine with me, this was the pleasure that I imagined to myself afresh every moment. It would have automatically perished if I had dined on that island without Mme. de Stermaria; but perhaps as greatly diminished had I dined, even with her, somewhere else. Besides, the attitudes in which one pictures a pleasure to oneself exist previously to the woman, to the type of woman required to give one that pleasure. They dictate the pleasure, and the place as well, and on that account bring to the fore alternatively, in our capricious fancy, this or that woman, this or that scene, this or that room, which in other weeks we should have dismissed with contempt. Child of the attitude that produced her, one woman will not appeal to us without the large bed in which we find peace by her side, while others, to be caressed with a more secret intention, require leaves blown by the wind, water rippling in the night, are as frail and fleeting as they\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt in the past, long before I received Saint-Loup\u2019s letter and when there was as yet no question of Mme. de Stermaria, the island in the Bois had seemed to me to be specially designed for pleasure, because I had found myself going there to taste the bitterness of having no pleasure to enjoy in its shelter. It is to the shores of the lake from which one goes to that island, and along which, in the last weeks of summer, those ladies of Paris who have not yet left for the country take the air, that, not knowing where to look for her, or if indeed she has not already left Paris, one wanders in the hope of seeing the girl go by with whom one fell in love at the last ball of the season, whom one will not have a chance of meeting again in any drawing-room until the following spring. Feeling it to be at least the eve, if not the morrow, of the beloved\u2019s departure, one follows along the brink of the shivering water those attractive paths by which already a first red leaf is blooming like a last rose, one scans that horizon where, by a device the opposite of that employed in those panoramas beneath whose domed roofs the wax figures in the foreground impart to the painted canvas beyond them the illusory appearance of depth and mass, our eyes, passing without any transition from the cultivated park to the natural heights of Meudon and the Mont Val\u00e9rien, do not know where to set the boundary, and make the natural country trespass upon the handiwork of the gardener, of which they project far beyond its own limits the artificial charm; like those rare birds reared in the open in a botanical garden which every day in the liberty of their winged excursions sally forth to strike, among the surrounding woods, an exotic note. Between the last festivity of summer and one\u2019s winter exile, one ranges anxiously that romantic world of chance encounters and lover\u2019s melancholy, and one would be no more surprised to learn that it was situated outside the mapped universe than if, at Versailles, looking down from the terrace, an observatory round which the clouds are massed against a blue sky in the manner of Van der Meulen, after having thus risen above the bounds of nature, one were informed that, there where nature begins again at the end of the great canal, the villages which one just could not make out, on a horizon as dazzling as the sea, were called Fleurus or Nim\u00e8gue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, the last carriage having rolled by, when one feels with a throb of pain that she will not come now, one goes to dine on the island; above the shivering poplars which suggest endless mysteries of evening though without response, a pink cloud paints a last touch of life in the tranquil sky. A few drops of rain fall without noise on the water, ancient but still in its diyine infancy coloured always by the weather and continually forgetting the reflexions of clouds and flowers. And after the geraniums have vainly striven, by intensifying the brilliance of their scarlet, to resist the gathering darkness, a mist rises to envelop the now slumbering island; one walks in the moist dimness along the water\u2019s edge, where at the most the silent passage of a swan startles one like, in a bed, at night, the eyes, for a moment wide open, and the swift smile of a child whom one did not suppose to be awake. Then one would like to have with one a loving companion, all the more as one feels oneself to be alone and can imagine oneself to be far away from the world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to this island, where even in summer there was often a mist, how much more gladly would I have brought Mme. de Stermaria now that the cold season, the back end of autumn had come. If the weather that had prevailed since Sunday had not by itself rendered grey and maritime the scenes in which my imagination was living \u2014 as other seasons made them balmy, luminous, Italian \u2014 the hope of, in a few days\u2019 time, making Mme. de Stermaria mine would have been quite enough to raise, twenty times in an hour, a curtain of mist in my monotonously lovesick imagination. In any event the mist, which since yesterday had risen even in Paris, not only made me think incessantly of the native place of the young woman whom I had invited to dine with me, but, since it was probable that, far more thickly than in the streets of the town, it must after sunset be invading the Bois, especially the shores of the lake, I thought that it would make the Swans\u2019 Island, for me, something like that Breton island the marine and misty atmosphere of which had always enwrapped in my mind like a garment the pale outline of Mme. de Stermaria. Of course when we are young, at the age I had reached at the period of my walks along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, our desires, our faith bestow on a woman\u2019s clothing an individual personality, an ultimate quintessence. We pursue reality. But by dint of allowing it to escape we end by noticing that, after all those vain endeavours which have led to nothing, something solid subsists, which is what we have been seeking. We begin to separate, to recognise what we love, we try to procure it for ourselves, be it only by a stratagem. Then, in the absence of our vanished faith, costume fills the gap, by means of a deliberate illusion. I knew quite well that within half an hour of home I should not find myself in Brittany. But in walking arm in arm with Mme. de Stermaria in the dusk of the island, by the water\u2019s edge, I should be acting like other men who, unable to penetrate the walls of \u00e0 convent, do at least, before enjoying a woman, clothe her in the habit of a nun\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could even look forward to hearing, as I sat with the lady, the lapping of waves, for, on the day before our dinner, a storm broke over Paris. I was beginning to shave myself before going to the island to engage the room (albeit at this time of year the island was empty and the restaurant deserted) and order the food for our dinner next day when Fran\u00e7oise came in to tell me that Albertine had called. I made her come in at once, indifferent to her finding me disfigured by a bristling chin, her for whom at Balbec I had never felt smart enough and who had cost me then as much agitation and distress as Mme. de Stermaria was costing me now. The latter, I was determined, must go away with the best possible impression from our evening together. Accordingly I asked Albertine to come with me there and then to the island to order the food. She to whom one gives everything is so quickly replaced by another that one is surprised to find oneself giving all that one has, afresh, at every moment, without any hope of future reward. At my suggestion the smiling rosy face beneath Albertine\u2019s flat cap, which came down very low, to her eyebrows, seemed to hesitate. She had probably other plans; if so she sacrificed them willingly, to my great satisfaction, for I attached the utmost importance to my having with me a young housewife who would know a great deal more than myself about ordering dinner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is quite true that she had represented something utterly different for me at Balbec. But our intimacy, even when we do not consider it close enough at the time, with a woman with whom we are in love creates between her and us, in spite of the shortcomings that pain us while our love lasts, social ties which outlast our love and even the memory of our love. Then, in her who is nothing more for us than a means of approach, an avenue towards others, we are just as astonished and amused to learn from our memory what her name meant originally to that other creature which we then were as if, after giving a cabman an address in the Boulevard des Capucines or the Rue du Bac, thinking only of the person whom we are going to see there, we remind ourself that the names were once those of, respectively, the Capuchin nuns whose convent stood on the site and the ferry across the Seine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, my Balbec desires had so generously ripened Albertine\u2019s body, had gathered and stored in it savours so fresh and sweet that, as we drove through the Bois, while the wind like a careful gardener shook the trees, brought down the fruit, swept up the fallen leaves, I said to myself that had there been any risk of Saint-Loup\u2019s being mistaken, or of my having misunderstood his letter, so that my dinner with Mme. de Stermaria might lead to no satisfactory result, I should have made an appointment for the same evening, later on, with Albertine, so as to forget, for a purely voluptuous hour, as I held in my arms a body of which my curiosity had long since computed, weighed up all the possible charms in which now it abounded, the emotions and perhaps the regrets of this first phase of love for Mme. de Stermaria. And certainly if I could have supposed that Mme de Stermaria would not grant me any of her favours at our first meeting, I should have formed a slightly depressing picture of my evening with her. I knew too well from experience how the two stages which occur in us in the first phase of our love for a woman whom we have desired without knowing her, loving in her rather the particular kind of existence in which she is steeped than her still unfamiliar self \u2014 how distorted is the reflexion of those two stages in the world of facts, that is to say not in ourselves any longer but in our meetings with her. We have, without ever having talked to her, hesitated, tempted as we were by the poetic charm which she represented for us. Shall it be this woman or another? And lo, our dreams become fixed round about her, cease to have any separate existence from her. The first meeting with her which will shortly follow should reflect this dawning love. Nothing of the sort. As if it were necessary that our material life should have its first period also, in love with her already, we talk to her in the most trivial fashion: \u201cI asked you to dine on this island because I thought the surroundings would amuse you. I\u2019ve nothing particular to say to you, don\u2019t you know. But it\u2019s rather damp, I\u2019m afraid, and you may find it cold \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, no, not at all!\u201d \u201cYou just say that out of politeness. Very well, Madame, I shall allow you to battle against the cold for another quarter of an hour, as I don\u2019t want to bother you, but in fifteen minutes I shall carry you off by force. I don\u2019t want to have you catching a chill.\u201d And without another word said we take her home, remembering nothing about her, at the most a certain look in her eyes, but thinking only of seeing her again. Well, at our second meeting (when we do not find even that look, our sole memory of her, but nevertheless have been thinking only of seeing her again), the first stage is passed. Nothing has happened in the interval. And yet, instead of talking about the comfort or want of comfort of the restaurant, we say, without our words appearing to surprise the new person, who seems to us positively plain but to whom we should like to think that people were talking about us at every moment in her life: \u201cWe are going to have our work cut out to overcome all the obstacles in our way. Do you think we shall be successful? Do you suppose that we can triumph over our enemies \u2014 live happily ever afterwards, and all that sort of thing?\u201d But these conversational openings, trivial to begin with, then hinting at love, would not be required; I could trust Saint-Loup\u2019s letter for that. Mme. de Stermaria would yield herself to me from the first, I should have no need therefore to engage Albertine to come to me, as a makeshift, later in the evening. It would be superfluous; Robert never exaggerated, and his letter was explicit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine spoke hardly at all, conscious that my thoughts were elsewhere. We went a little way on foot into the greenish, almost submarine grotto of a dense mass of trees, on the domed tops of which we heard the wind sweep and the rain pelt. I trod underfoot dead leaves which, like shells, were trampled into the soil, and poked with my stick at fallen chestnuts prickly as sea-urchins\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the boughs the last clinging leaves, shaken by the wind, followed it only as far as their stems would allow, but sometimes these broke, and they fell to the ground, along which they coursed to overtake it. I thought with joy how much more remote still, if this weather lasted, the island would be on the morrow \u2014 and in any case quite deserted. We returned to our carriage and, as the storm had passed off, Albertine asked me to take her on to Saint-Cloud. As on the ground the drifting leaves so up above the clouds were chasing the wind. And a stream of migrant evenings, of which a sort of conic section cut through the sky made visible the successive layers, pink, blue and green, were gathered in readiness for departure to warmer climes. To obtain a closer view of a marble goddess who had been carved in the act of leaping from her pedestal and, alone in a great wood which seemed to be consecrated to her, filled it with the mythological terror, half animal, half divine, of her frenzied bounding, Albertine climbed a grassy slope while I waited for her in the road. She herself, seen thus from below, no longer coarse and plump as, a few days earlier, on my bed when the grain of her throat became apparent in the lens of my eye as it approached her person, but chiselled and delicate, seemed a little statue on which our happy hours together at Balbec had left their patina. When I found myself alone again at home, and remembered that I had taken a drive that afternoon with Albertine, that I was to dine in two days\u2019 time with Mme. de Guermantes and that I had to answer a letter from Gilberte, three women each of whom I had once loved, I said to myself that our social existence is, like an artist\u2019s studio, filled with abandoned sketches in which we have fancied for a moment that we could set down in permanent form our need of a great love, but it did not occur to me that sometimes, if the sketch be not too old, it may happen that we return to it and make of it a work wholly different, and possibly more important than what we had originally planned\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next day was cold and fine; winter was in the air \u2014 indeed the season was so far advanced that it had seemed miraculous that we should find in the already pillaged Bois a few domes of gilded green. When I awoke I saw, as from the window of the barracks at Donci\u00e8res, a uniform, dead white mist which hung gaily in the sunlight, consistent and sweet as a web of spun sugar. Then the sun withdrew, and the mist thickened still further in the afternoon. Night fell early, I made ready for dinner, but it was still too soon to start; I decided to send a carriage for Mme. de Stermaria. I did not like to go for her in it myself, not wishing to force my company on her, but I gave the driver a note for her in which I asked whether she would mind my coming to call for her. While I waited for her answer I lay down on my bed, shut my eyes for a moment, then opened them again. Over the top of the curtains there was nothing now but a thin strip of daylight which grew steadily fainter. I recognised that wasted hour, the large ante-room of pleasure, the dark, delicious emptiness of which I had learned at Balbec to know and to enjoy when, alone in my room as I was now, while all the rest were at dinner, I saw without regret the daylight fade from above my curtains, knowing that, presently, after a night of arctic brevity, it was to be resuscitated in a more dazzling brightness in the lighted rooms of Rivebelle. I sprang from my bed, tied my black necktie, passed a brush over my hair, final gestures of a belated tidying carried out at Balbec with my mind not on myself but on the women whom I should see at Rivebelle while I smiled at them in anticipation in the mirror that stood across a corner of my room, gestures which, on that account, had continued to herald a form of entertainment in which music and lights would be mingled. Like magic signs they summoned, nay rather presented this entertainment already; thanks to them I had, of its intoxicating frivolous charm as complete an enjoyment as I had had at Combray, in the month of July, when I heard the hammer-blows ring on the packing cases and enjoyed, in the coolness of my darkened room, a sense of warmth and sunshine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also, it was no longer exactly Mme. de Stermaria that I should have wished most to see. Forced now to spend my evening with her, I should have preferred, as it was almost the last before the return of my parents that it should remain free and myself try instead to find some of the women from Rivebelle. I gave my hands one more final wash and, my sense of pleasure keeping me on the move, dried them as I walked through the shuttered dining-room. It appeared to have a door open on to the lighted hall but what I had taken for the bright chink of the door, which as a matter of fact was closed, was only the gleaming reflexion of my towel in a mirror that had been laid against the wall in readiness to be fixed in its place before Mamma\u2019s return. I thought of all the other illusions of the sort which I had discovered in different parts of the house, and which were not optical only, for when we first came there I had supposed that our next-door neighbour kept a dog on account of the continuous, almost human yapping which came from a certain pipe in the kitchen whenever the tap was turned on. And the door on to the outer landing never closed by itself, very gently, caught by a draught on the staircase, without rendering those broken, voluptuous, whimpering passages which sound over the chant of the pilgrims towards the end of Overture to Tannh\u00e4user. I had, moreover, just as I had put my towel back on its rail, an opportunity of hearing a fresh rendering of this brilliant symphonic fragment, for at a peal of the bell I hurried out to open the door to the driver who had come with Mme. de Stermaria\u2019s answer. I thought that his message would be: \u201cThe lady is downstairs,\u201d or \u201cThe lady is waiting.\u201d But he had a letter in his hand. I hesitated for a moment before looking to see what Mme. de Stermaria had written, who, while she held the pen in her hand, might have been anything but was now, detached from herself, an engine of fate, pursuing a course alone, which she was utterly powerless to alter. I asked the driver to wait downstairs for a moment, although he was cursing the fog. As soon as he had gone I opened the envelope. On her card, inscribed Vicomtesse Alix de. Stermaria, my guest had written: \u201cAm so sorry \u2014 am unfortunately prevented from dining with you this evening on the island in the Bois. Had been so looking forward to it. Will write you a proper letter from Stermaria. Very sorry. Kindest regards.\u201d I stood motionless, stunned by the shock that I had received. At my feet lay the card and envelope, fallen like the spent cartridge from a gun when the shot has been fired. I picked them up, tried to analyse her message. \u201cShe says that she cannot dine with me on the island in the Bois. One might gather from that that she would dine with me somewhere else. I shall not be so indiscreet as to go and fetch her, but, after all, that is quite a reasonable interpretation.\u201d And from that island in the Bois, as for the last few days my thoughts had been installed there beforehand with Mme. de Sterm\u00e2ria, I could not succeed in bringing them back to where I was. My desire responded automatically to the gravitational force which had been pulling it now for so many hours on end, and in spite of this message, too recent to counteract that force, I went on instinctively getting ready to start, just as a student, although ploughed by the examiners, tries to answer one question more. At last I decided to tell Fran\u00e7oise to go down and pay the driver. I went along the passage without finding her, I passed through the dining-room, where suddenly my feet ceased to sound on the bare boards as they had been doing and were hushed to a silence which, even before I had realised the explanation of it, gave me a feeling of suffocation and confinement. It was the carpets which, in view of my parents\u2019 return, the servants had begun to put down again, those carpets which look so well on bright mornings when amid their disorder the sun stays and waits for you like a friend come to take you out to luncheon in the country, and casts over them the dappled light and shade of the forest, but which now on the contrary were the first installation of the wintry prison from which, obliged as I should be to live, to take my meals at home, I should no longer be free now to escape when I chose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTake care you don\u2019t slip, Sir; they\u2019re not tacked yet,\u201d Fran\u00e7oise called to me. \u201cI ought to have lighted up. Oh, dear, it\u2019s the end of \u2018Sectember\u2019 already, the fine days are over.\u201d In no time, winter; at the corner of a window, as in a Galle glass, a vein of crusted snow; and even in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, instead of the girls one waits to see, nothing but solitary sparrows\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What added to my distress at not seeing Mme. de Sterm\u00e2ria was that her answer led me to suppose that whereas, hour by hour, since Sunday, I had been living for this dinner alone, she had presumably never given it a second thought. Later on I learned of an absurd love match that she had suddenly made with a young man whom she must already have been seeing at this time, and who had presumably made her forget my invitation. For if she had remembered it she would surely never have waited for the carriage which I was not, for that matter, supposed to be sending for her, to inform me that she was otherwise engaged. My dreams of a young feudal maiden on a misty island had cleared the way to a still non-existent love. Now my disappointment, my rage, my desperate desire to recapture her who had just refused me were able, by bringing my sensibility into play, to make definite the possible love which until then my imagination alone had \u2014 and that more loosely \u2014 offered me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How many are there in our memories, how many more have we forgotten, of these faces of girls and young women, all different, to which we have added a certain charm and a frenzied desire to see them again only because at the last moment they eluded us? In the case of Mme. de Stermaria there was a good deal more than this, and it was enough now to make me love her for me to see her again so that I might refresh those impressions, so vivid but all too brief, which my memory would not, without such refreshment, have the strength to keep alive when we were apart. Circumstances decided against me; I did not see her again. It was not she that I loved, but it might well have been. And one of the things that made most cruel, perhaps, the great love which was presently to come to me was that when I thought of this evening I used to say to myself that my love might, given a slight modification of very ordinary circumstances, have been directed elsewhere, to Mme. de Stermaria; its application to her who inspired it in me so soon afterwards was not therefore \u2014 as I so longed so needed to believe \u2014 absolutely necessary and predestined\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise had left me by myself in the dining-room with the remark that it was foolish of me to stay there before she had lighted the fire. She went to get me some dinner, for even before the return of my parents, from this very evening, my seclusion was to begin. I caught sight of a huge bundle of carpets, still rolled up, and leaning against one end of the sideboard, and burying my head in it, swallowing its dust with my own tears, as the Jews used to cover their heads with ashes in times of mourning, I began to sob. I shuddered not only because the room was cold, but because a distinct lowering of temperature (against the danger and \u2014 I should add, perhaps \u2014 the by no means disagreeable sensation of which we make no attempt to react) is brought about by a certain kind of tears which fall from our eyes, drop by drop, like a fine, penetrating, icy rain, and seem as though never would they cease to flow. Suddenly I heard a voice:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMay I come in? Fran\u00e7oise told me you would be in the dining-room. I looked in to see whether you would care to come out and dine somewhere, if it isn\u2019t bad for your throat \u2014 there\u2019s a fog outside you could cut with a knife.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was \u2014 arrived in Paris that morning, when I imagined him to be still in Morocco or on the sea \u2014 Robert de Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have already said (as a matter of fact, it was Robert himself who, at Balbec, had helped me, quite without meaning it, to arrive at this conclusion) what I think about friendship: to wit that it is so small a thing that I find it hard to understand how men with some claim to genius \u2014 Nietzsche, for instance \u2014 can have been such simpletons as to ascribe to it a certain intellectual value, and consequently to deny themselves friendships in which intellectual esteem would have no part. Yes, it has always been a surprise to me to find a man who carried sincerity towards himself to so high a pitch as to cut himself off, by a scruple of conscience, from Wagner\u2019s music, imagining that the truth could ever be attained by the mode of expression, naturally vague and inadequate, which our actions in general and acts of friendship in particular furnish, or that there could be any kind of significance in the fact of one\u2019s leaving one\u2019s work to go and see a friend and shed tears with him on hearing the false report that the Louvre was burned. I had got so far, at Balbec, as to find that the pleasure of playing with a troop of girls is less destructive of the spiritual life, to which at least it remains alien, than friendship, the whole effort of which is directed towards making us sacrifice the one real and (save by the channel of art) incommunicable part of ourself to a superficial self which finds \u2014 not, like the other, any joy in itself, but rather a vague, sentimental attraction in the feeling that it is being supported by external props, hospitably entertained by a strange personality, through which, happy in the protection that is afforded it there, it makes its own comfort radiate in warm approval, and marvels at qualities which it would denounce as faults and seek to correct in itself. Moreover the scorners of friendship can, without illusion and not without remorse, be the finest friends in the world, just as an artist carrying in his brain a masterpiece and feeling that his duty is rather to live and carry on his work, nevertheless, so as not to be thought or to run the risk of actually being selfish, gives his life for a vain cause, and gives it all the more gallantly in that the reasons for which he would have preferred not to give it were disinterested. But whatever might be my opinion of friendship, to mention only the pleasure that it procured me, of a quality so mediocre as to be like something halfway between physical exhaustion and mental boredom, there is no brew so deadly that it cannot at certain moments, become precious and invigorating by giving us just the stimulus that was necessary, the warmth that we cannot generate in ourselves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The thought of course never entered my mind now of asking Saint-Loup to take me (as, an hour earlier, I had been longing to go) to see some of the Rivebelle women; the scar left by my disappointment with Mme. de Stermaria was too recent still to be so easily healed, but at the moment when I had ceased to feel in my heart any reason for happiness Saint-Loup\u2019s bursting in upon me was like a sudden apparition of kindness, mirth, life, which were external to me, no doubt, but offered themselves to me, asked only to be made mine. He did not himself understand my shout of gratitude, my tears of affection. And yet is there anything more unaccountably affecting than one of those friends, be he diplomat, explorer, airman or soldier like Saint-Loup, who, having to start next day for the country, from where they will go on heaven knows where, seem to form for themselves, in the evening which they devote to us, an impression which we are astonished both to find, so rare and fleeting is it, can be so pleasant to them, and, since it does so delight them, not to see them prolong farther or repeat more often. A meal with us, an event so natural in itself, affords these travellers the same strange and exquisite pleasure as our boulevards give to an Asiatic. We set off together to dine, and as I went downstairs I thought of Donci\u00e8res where every evening I used to meet Robert at his restaurant, and the little dining-rooms there that I had forgotten. I remembered one of these to which I had never given a thought, and which was not in the hotel where Saint-Loup dined but in another, far humbler, a cross between an inn and a boarding-house, where the waiting was done by the landlady and one of her servants. I had been forced to take shelter there once from a snowstorm. Besides, Robert was not to be dining at the hotel that evening and I had not cared to go any farther. My food was brought to me, upstairs, in a little room with bare wooden walls. The lamp went out during dinner and the servant lighted a couple of candles. I, pretending that I could not see very well as I held out my plate, while she helped me to potatoes, took her bare fore-arm in my hand, as though to guide her. Seeing that she did not withdraw it, I began to fondle it, then, without saying a word, pulled her bodily to me, blew out the candles and told her to feel in my pocket for some money. For the next few days physical pleasure seemed to me to require, to be properly enjoyed, not only this servant but the timbered dining-room, so remote and lonely. And yet it was to the other, in which Saint-Loup and his friends dined, that I returned every evening, from force of habit and in friendship for them, until I left Donci\u00e8res. But even of this hotel, where he took his meals with his friends, I had long ceased to think; we make little use of our experience, we leave unconsumed in the summer dusk or precocious nights of winter the hours in which it had seemed to us that there might nevertheless be contained some element of tranquillity or pleasure. But those hours are not altogether wasted. When, in their turn, come and sing to us fresh moments of pleasure, which by themselves would pass by equally bare in outline, the others recur, bringing with them the groundwork, the solid consistency of a rich orchestration. They are in this way prolonged into one of those types of happiness which we recapture only now and again but which continue to exist; in the present instance the type was that of forsaking everything else to dine in comfortable surroundings, which by the help of memory embody in a scene from nature suggestions of the rewards of travel, with a friend who is going to stir our dormant life with all his energy, his affection, to communicate to us an emotional pleasure, very different from anything that we could derive from our own efforts or from social distractions; we are going to exist solely for him, to utter vows of friendship which, born within the confines of the hour, remaining imprisoned in it, will perhaps not be kept on the morrow but which I need have no scruple in taking before Saint-Loup since, with a courage into which there entered a great deal of common sense and the presentiment that friendship cannot explore its own depths, on the morrow he would be gone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If as I came downstairs I lived over again the evenings at Donci\u00e8res, when we reached the street, in a moment the darkness, now almost total, in which the fog seemed to have put out the lamps, which one could make out, glimmering very faintly, only when close at hand, took me back to I could not say what arrival, by night, at Combray, when the streets there were still lighted only at long intervals and one felt one\u2019s way through a darkness moist, warm, consecrated, like that of a Christmas manger, just visibly starred here and there by a wick that burned no brighter than a candle. Between that year \u2014 to which I could ascribe no precise date \u2014 of my Combray life and the evenings at Rivebelle which had, an hour earlier, been reflected above my drawn curtains, what a world of differences! I felt on perceiving them an enthusiasm which might have borne fruit had I been left alone and would then have saved me the unnecessary round of many wasted years through which I was yet to pass before there was revealed to me that invisible vocation of which these volumes are the history. Had the revelation come to me this evening, the carriage in which I sat would have deserved to rank as more memorable with me than Dr. Percepied\u2019s, on the box seat of which I had composed that little sketch \u2014 on which, as it happened, I had recently laid my hands, altered it and sent it in vain to theFigaro \u2014 of the spires of Martinville. Is it because we live over our past years not in their continuous sequence, day by day, but in a memory that fastens upon the coolness or sun-parched heat of some morning or afternoon, receives the shadow of some solitary place, is enclosed, immovable, arrested, lost, remote from all others, because, therefore, the changes gradually wrought not only in the world outside but in our dreams and our evolving character (changes which have imperceptibly carried us through life from one to another, wholly different time), are of necessity eliminated, that, if we revive another memory taken from a different year, we find between the two, thanks to lacunae, to vast stretches of oblivion, as it were the gulf of a difference in altitude or the incompatibility of two divers qualities, that of the air we breathe and the colour of the scene before our eyes? But between one and another of the memories that had now come to me in turn of Combray, of Donci\u00e8res and of Rivebelle, I was conscious at the moment of more than a distance in time, of the distance that there would be between two separate universes the material elements in which were not the same. If I had sought to reproduce the element in which appeared carven my most trivial memories of Rivebelle, I should have had to streak with rosy veins, to render at once translucent, compact, refreshing, resonant a substance hitherto analogous to the coarse dark sandstone walls of Combray. But Robert having finished giving his instructions to the driver joined me now in the carriage. The ideas that had appeared before me took flight. Ideas are goddesses who deign at times to make themselves visible to a solitary mortal, at a turning in the road, even in his bedroom while he sleeps, when they, standing framed in the doorway, bring him the annunciation of their tidings. But as soon as a companion joins him they vanish, in the society of his fellows no man has ever beheld them. And I found myself cast back upon friendship. When he first appeared Robert had indeed warned me that there was a good deal of fog outside, but while we were indoors, talking, it had grown steadily thicker. It was no longer merely the light mist which I had looked forward to seeing rise from the island and envelop Mme. de Stermaria and myself. A few feet away from us the street lamps were blotted out and then it was night, as dark as in the open fields, in a forest, or rather on a mild Breton island whither I would fain have gone; I lost myself, as on the stark coast of some. Northern sea where one risks one\u2019s life twenty times over before coming to the solitary inn; ceasing to be a mirage for which one seeks, the fog became one of those dangers against which one has to fight, so that we had, in finding our way and reaching a safe haven, the difficulties, the anxiety and finally the joy which safety, so little perceived by him who is not threatened with the loss of it, gives to the perplexed and benighted traveller. One thing only came near to destroying my pleasure during our adventurous ride, owing to the angry astonishment into which it flung me for a moment, \u201cYou know, I told Bloch,\u201d Saint-Loup suddenly informed me, \u201cthat you didn\u2019t really think all that of him, that you found him rather vulgar at times. I\u2019m like that, you see, I want people to know where they stand,\u201d he wound up with a satisfied air and in a tone which brooked no reply. I was astounded. Not only had I the most absolute confidence in Saint-Loup, in the loyalty of his friendship, and he had betrayed it by what he had said to Bloch, but it seemed to me that he of all men ought to have been restrained from doing so, by his defects as well as by his good qualities, by that astonishing veneer of breeding which was capable of carrying politeness to what was positively a want of frankness. His triumphant air, was it what we assume to cloak a certain embarrassment in admitting a thing which we know that we ought not to have done, or did it mean complete unconsciousness; stupidity making a virtue out of a defect which I had not associated with him; a passing fit of ill humour towards me prompting him to make an end of our friendship, or the notation in words of a passing fit of ill humour in the company of Bloch to whom he had felt that he must say something disagreeable, even although I should be compromised by it? However that might be, his face was seared, while he uttered this vulgar speech, by a frightful sinuosity which I saw on it once or twice only in all the time I knew him, and which, beginning by running more or less down the middle of his face, when it came to his lips twisted them, gave them a hideous expression of baseness, almost of bestiality, quite transitory and no doubt inherited. There must have been at such moments, which recurred probably not more than once every other year, a partial eclipse of his true self by the passage across it of the personality of some ancestor whose shadow fell on him. Fully as much as his satisfied air, the words: \u201cI want people to know where they stand,\u201d encouraged the same doubt and should have incurred a similar condemnation. I felt inclined to say to him that if one wants people to know where they stand one ought to confine these outbursts of frankness to one\u2019s own affairs and not to acquire a too easy merit at the expense of others. But by this time the carriage had stopped outside the restaurant, the huge front of which, glazed and streaming with light, alone succeeded in piercing the darkness. The fog itself, beside the comfortable brightness of the lighted interior, seemed to be waiting outside on the pavement to shew one the way in with the joy of servants whose faces reflect the hospitable instincts of their master; shot with the most delicate shades of light, it pointed the way like the pillar of fire which guided the Children of Israel. Many of whom, as it happened, were to be found inside. For this was the place to which Bloch and his friends had long been in the habit, maddened by a hunger as famishing as the Ritual Fast, which at least occurs only once a year, for coffee and the satisfaction of political curiosity, of repairing in the evenings. Every mental excitement creating a value that overrides others, a quality superior to the rest of one\u2019s habits, there is no taste at all keenly developed that does not thus gather round it a society which it unites and in which the esteem of his fellows is what each of its members seeks before anything else from life. Here, in their caf\u00e9, be it in a little provincial town, you will find impassioned music-lovers; the greater part of their time, all their spare cash is spent in chamber-concerts, in meetings for musical discussion, in caf\u00e9s where one finds oneself among musical people and rubs shoulders with the members of the orchestra. Others, keen upon flying, seek to stand well with the old waiter in the glazed bar perched on top of the aerodrome; sheltered from the wind as in the glass cage of a lighthouse, they can follow in the company of an airman who is not going up that day the evolutions of a pilot practising loops, while another, invisible a moment ago, comes suddenly swooping down to land with the great winged roar of an Arabian roc. The little group which met to try to perpetuate, to explore the fugitive emotions aroused by the Zola trial attached a similar importance to this particular caf\u00e9. But they were not viewed with favour by the young nobles who composed the rest of its patrons and had taken possession of a second room, separated from the other only by a flimsy parapet topped with a row of plants. These looked upon Dreyfus and his supporters as traitors, albeit twenty-five years later, ideas having had time to classify themselves and Dreyfusism to acquire, in the light of history, a certain distinction, the sons, dance-mad Bolshevists, of these same young nobles were to declare to the \u2018intellectuals\u2019 who questioned them that undoubtedly, had they been alive at the time, they would have stood up for Dreyfus, without having any clearer idea of what the great Case had been about than Comtesse Edmond de Pourtal\u00e8s or the Marquise de Galliffet, other luminaries already extinct at the date of their birth. For on the night of the fog the noblemen of the caf\u00e9, who were in^ due course to become the fathers of these young intellectuals, Dreyfusards in retrospect, were still bachelors. Naturally the idea of a rich marriage was present in the minds of all their families, but none of them had yet brought such a marriage off. While still potential, the only effect of this rich marriage, the simultaneous ambition of several of them (there were indeed several heiresses in view, but after all the number of big dowries was considerably below that of the aspirants to them), was to create among these young men a certain amount of rivalry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As ill luck would have it, Saint-Loup remaining outside for a minute to explain to the driver that he was to call for us again after dinner, I had to make my way in by myself. In the first place, once I had involved myself in the spinning door, to which I was not accustomed, I began to fear that I should never succeed in escaping from it. (Let me note here for the benefit of lovers of verbal accuracy that the contrivance in question, despite its peaceful appearance, is known as a \u2018revolver,\u2019 from the English \u2018revolving door.\u2019) This evening the proprietor, not venturing either to brave the elements outside or to desert his customers, remained standing near the entrance so as to have the pleasure of listening to the joyful complaints of the new arrivals, all aglow with the satisfaction of people who have had difficulty in reaching a place and have been afraid of losing their way. The smiling cordiality of his welcome was, however, dissipated by the sight of a stranger incapable of disengaging himself from the rotating sheets of glass. This flagrant sign of social ignorance made him knit his brows like an examiner who has a good mind not to utter the formula: Dignus est intrare. As a crowning error I went to look for a seat in the room set apart for the nobility, from which he at once expelled me, indicating to me, with a rudeness to which all the waiters at once conformed, a place in the other room. This was all the less to my liking because the seat was in the middle of a crowded row and I had opposite me the door reserved for the Hebrews which, as it did not revolve, opening and shutting at every moment kept me in a horrible draught. But the proprietor declined to move me, saying: \u201cNo, Sir, I cannot have the whole place upset for you.\u201d Presently, however, he forgot this belated and troublesome guest, captivated as he was by the arrival of each newcomer who, before calling for his beer, his wing of cold chicken or his hot grog (it was by now long past dinner-time), must first, as in the old romances, pay his scot by relating his adventure at the moment of his entry into this asylum of warmth and security where the contrast with the perils just escaped made that gaiety and sense of comradeship prevail which create a cheerful harmony round the campfire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One reported that his carriage, thinking it had got to the Pont de la Concorde, had circled three times round the Invalides, another that his, in trying to make its way down the Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es, had driven into a clump of trees at the Rond Point, from which it had taken him three quarters of an hour to get clear. Then followed lamentations upon the fog, the cold, the deathly stillness of the streets, uttered and received with the same exceptionally jovial air, which was accounted for by the pleasant atmosphere of the room which, except where I sat, was warm, the dazzling light which set blinking eyes already accustomed to not seeing, and the buzz of talk which restored their activity to deafened ears\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was all the newcomers could do to keep silence. The singularity of the mishaps which each of them thought unique burned their tongues, and their eyes roved in search of some one to engage in conversation. The proprietor himself lost all sense of social distinction. \u201cM. le Prince de Foix lost his way three times coming from the Porte Saint-Martin,\u201d he was not afraid to say with a laugh, actually pointing out, as though introducing one to the other, the illustrious nobleman to an Israelite barrister, who, on any evening but this, would have been divided from him by a barrier far harder to surmount than the ledge of greenery. \u201cThree times \u2014 fancy that!\u201d said the barrister, touching his hat. This note of personal interest was not at all to the Prince\u2019s liking. He formed one of an aristocratic group for whom the practice of impertinence, even at the expense of their fellow-nobles when these were not of the very highest rank, seemed the sole possible occupation. Not to acknowledge a bow, and, if the polite stranger repeated the offence, to titter with sneering contempt or fling back one\u2019s head with a look of fury, to pretend not to know some elderly man who might have done them a service, to reserve their handclasp for dukes and the really intimate friends of dukes whom the latter introduced to them, such was the attitude of these young men, and especially of the Prince de Foix. Such an attitude was encouraged by the ill-balanced mentality of early manhood (a period in which, even in the middle class, one appears ungrateful and behaves like a cad because, having forgotten for months to write to a benefactor after he has lost his wife, one then ceases to nod to him in the street so as to simplify matters), but it was inspired above all by an over-acute caste snobbishness. It is true that, after the fashion of certain nervous affections the symptoms of which grow less pronounced in later life, this snobbishness was on the whole to cease to express itself in so offensive a form in these men who had been so intolerable when young. Once youth is outgrown, it is seldom that anyone remains hidebound by insolence. He had supposed it to be the only thing in the world; suddenly he discovers, for all the Prince that he is, that there also are such things as music, literature, even standing for parliament. The scale of human values is correspondingly altered and he joins in conversation with people whom at one time he would have slain with a glare of lightning. Which is fortunate for those of the latter who have had the patience to wait, and whose character is sufficiently formed \u2014 if one may so put it \u2014 for them to feel pleasure in receiving in their forties the civility and welcome that had been coldly withheld from them at twenty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I have mentioned the Prince de Foix, it may not be inconsequent here to add that he belonged to a set of a dozen or fifteen young men and to an inner group of four. The dozen or fifteen shared this characteristic (which the Prince lacked, I fancy) that each of them faced the world in a dual aspect. Up to their own eyes in debt, they were of no account in those of their tradesmen, notwithstanding the pleasure these took in addressing them as \u2018Monsieur le Comte,\u2019 \u2018Monsieur le Marquis,\u2019 \u2018Monsieur le Duc.\u2019 They hoped to retrieve their fortunes by means of the famous rich marriage (\u2018money-bags\u2019 as the expression still was) and, as the fat dowries which they coveted numbered at the most four or five, several of them would be silently training their batteries on the same damsel. And the secret would be so well kept that when one of them, on arriving at the caf\u00e9, announced: \u201cMy dear fellows, I am too fond of you all not to tell you of my engagement to Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac,\u201d there was a general outburst, more than one of the others imagining that the marriage was as good as settled already between Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac and himself, and not having enough self-control to stifle a spontaneous cry of stupefaction and rage. \u201cSo you like the idea of marriage, do you Bibi?\u201d the Prince de Ch\u00e2tellerault could not help exclaiming, letting his fork drop in his surprise and despair, for he had been fully expecting the engagement of this identical Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac to be announced, but with himself, Ch\u00e2tellerault, as her bridegroom. And heaven only knew all that his father had cunningly hinted to the Ambresacs against Bibi\u2019s mother. \u201cSo you think it\u2019ll be fun, being married, do you?\u201d he was impelled to repeat his question to Bibi, who, better prepared to meet it, for he had had plenty of time to decide on the right attitude to adopt since the engagement had reached the semi-official stage, replied with a smile: \u201cWhat pleases me is not the idea of marriage, which never appealed much to me, but marrying Daisy d\u2019Ambresac, whom I think charming.\u201d In the time taken up by this response M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault had recovered his composure, but he was thinking that he must at the earliest possible moment execute a change of front in the direction of Mlle. de la Canourque or Miss Foster, numbers two and three on the list of heiresses, pacify somehow the creditors who were expecting the Ambresac marriage and finally explain to the people to whom he too had declared that Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac was charming that this marriage was all very well for Bibi, but that he himself would have had all his family down on him like a ton of bricks if he had married her. Mme. Sol\u00e9on (he decided to say) had actually announced that she would not have them in her house\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if in the eyes of tradesmen, proprietors of restaurants and the like they seemed of little account, conversely, being creatures of dual personality, the moment they appeared in society they ceased to be judged by the decay of their fortunes and the sordid occupations by which they sought to repair them. They became once more M. le Prince this, M. le Duc that and were reckoned only in terms of their quarterings. A duke who was prac^ tically a multi-millionaire and seemed to combine in his own person every possible distinction gave precedence to them because, the heads of their various houses, they were by descent sovereign princes of minute territories in which they were entitled to coin money and so forth. Often in this caf\u00e9 one of them lowered his eyes when another came in so as not to oblige the newcomer to greet him. This was because in his imaginative pursuit of riches he had invited a banker to dine. Every time that a man about town enters into relations, on this footing, with a banker, the latter leaves him the poorer by a hundred thousand francs, which does not prevent the man about town from at once repeating the process with another. We continue to burn candles in churches and to consult doctors\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the Prince de Foix, who was rich already, belonged not only to this fashionable set of fifteen or so young men, but to a more exclusive and inseparable group of four which included Saint-Loup. These were never asked anywhere separately, they were known as the four gigolos, they were always to be seen riding together, in country houses their hostesses gave them communicating bedrooms, with the result that, especially as they were all four extremely good looking, rumours were current as to the extent of their intimacy. I was in a position to give these the lie direct so far as Saint-Loup was concerned. But the curious thing is that if, later on, one was to learn that these rumours were true of all four, each of the quartet had been entirely in the dark as to the other three. And yet each of them had done his utmost to find out about the others, to gratify a desire or (more probably) a resentment, to prevent a marriage or to secure a hold over the friend whose secret he discovered. A fifth (for in these groups of four there are never four only) had joined this Platonic party who was more so than any of the others. But religious scruples restrained him until long after the group had broken up, and he himself was a married man, the father of a family, fervently praying at Lourdes that the next baby might be a boy or a girl, and spending the intervals of procreation in the pursuit of soldiers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the Prince\u2019s code of manners, the fact that the barrister\u2019s comment, though uttered in his hearing, had not been directly addressed to him made him less angry than he would otherwise have been. Besides, this evening was somewhat exceptional. Finally, the barrister had no more prospect of coming to know the Prince de Foix than the cabman who had driven that noble lord to the restaurant. The Prince felt, accordingly, that he might allow himself to reply, in an arrogant tone, as though speaking to some one \u2018off stage,\u2019 to this stranger who, thanks to the fog, was in the position of a travelling companion whom one meets at some seaside place at the ends of the earth, scoured by all the winds of heaven or shrouded in mist: \u201cLosing your way\u2019s nothing; the trouble is, you can\u2019t find it again.\u201d The wisdom of this aphorism impressed the proprietor, for he had already heard it several times in the course of the evening\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was, in fact, in the habit of always comparing what he heard or read with an already familiar canon, and felt his admiration aroused if he could detect no difference. This state of mind is by no means to be ignored, for, applied to political conversations, to the reading of newspapers, it forms public opinion and thereby makes possible the greatest events in history. An aggregation of German landlords, simply by being impressed by a customer or a newspaper when he or it said that France, England and Russia were \u2018out to crush\u2019 Germany, made war, at the time of Agadir, possible, even if no war occurred. Historians, if they have not been wrong to abandon the practice of attributing the actions of peoples to the will of kings, ought to substitute for the latter the psychology of the person of no importance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In politics the proprietor of this particular caf\u00e9 had for some time now concentrated his pupil-teacher\u2019s mind on certain particular details of the Dreyfus case. If he did not find the terms that were familiar to him in the conversation of a customer or the columns of a newspaper he would pronounce the article boring or the speaker insincere. The Prince de Foix, however, impressed him so forcibly that he barely gave him time to finish what he was saying. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Prince, that\u2019s right,\u201d (which meant neither more nor less than \u2018repeated without a mistake\u2019) \u201cthat\u2019s exactly how it is!\u201d he exclaimed, expanding, like people in the Arabian Nights \u2018to the limit of repletion.\u2019 But the Prince had by this time vanished into the smaller room. Then, as life resumes its normal course after even the most sensational happenings, those who had emerged from the sea of fog began to order whatever they wanted to eat or drink; among them a party of young men from the Jockey Club who, in view of the abnormality of the situation, had no hesitation in taking their places at a couple of tables in the big room, and were thus quite close to me. So the cataclysm had established even between the smaller room and the bigger, among all these people stimulated by the comfort of the restaurant after their long wanderings across the ocean of fog, a familiarity from which I alone was excluded, not unlike the spirit that must have prevailed in Noah\u2019s ark. Suddenly I saw the landlord\u2019s body whipped into a series of bows, the head waiters hurrying to support him in a full muster which drew every eye towards the door. \u201cQuick, send Cyprien here, lay a table for M. le Marquis de Saint-Loup,\u201d cried the proprietor, for whom Robert was not merely a great nobleman possessing a real importance even in the eyes of the Prince de Foix, but a client who drove through life four-in-hand, so to speak, and spent a great deal of money in this restaurant. The customers in the big room looked on with interest, those in the small room shouted simultaneous greetings to their friend as he finished wiping his shoes. But just as he was about to make his way into the small room he caught sight of me in the big one. \u201cGood God,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cwhat on earth are you doing there? And with the door wide open too?\u201d he went on, with an angry glance at the proprietor, who ran to shut it, throwing the blame on his staff: \u201cI\u2019m always telling them to keep it shut.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had been obliged to shift my own table and to disturb others which stood in the way in order to reach him. \u201cWhy did you move? Would you sooner dine here than in the little room? Why, my poor fellow, you\u2019re freezing. You will oblige me by keeping that door locked;\u201d he turned to the proprietor. \u201cThis very instant, M. le Marquis; the gentlemen will have to go out of this room through the other, that is all.\u201d And the better to shew his zeal he detailed for this operation a head waiter and several satel lites, vociferating the most terrible threats of punishment were it not properly carried out. He began to shew me exaggerated marks of respect so as to make me forget that these had begun not upon my arrival but only after that of Saint-Loup, while, lest I should think them to have been prompted by the friendliness shewn me by his rich and noble client he gave me now and again a surreptitious little smile which seemed to indicate a regard that was wholly personal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something said by one of the diners behind me made me turn my head for a moment. I had caught, instead of the words: \u201cWing of chicken, excellent; and a glass of champagne, only not too dry,\u201d the unexpected: \u201cI should prefer glycerine. Yes, hot, excellent.\u201d I wanted to see who the ascetic was that was inflicting upon himself such a diet. I turned quickly back to Saint-Loup so as not to be recognised by the man of strange appetite. It was simply a doctor, whom I happened to know, and of whom another customer, taking advantage of the fog to buttonhole him here in the caf\u00e9, was asking his professional advice. Like stockbrokers, doctors employ the first person singular\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile I was studying Saint-Loup, and my thoughts took a line of their own. They were in this caf\u00e9, I had myself known at other times, plenty of foreigners, intellectuals, budding geniuses of all sorts, resigned to the laughter excited by their pretentious capes, their 1830 neckties and still more by the clumsiness of their movements, going so far as to provoke that laughter in order to shew that they paid no heed to it, who yet were men of real intellectual and moral worth, of an extreme sensibility. They repelled \u2014 the Jews among them principally, the unassimilated Jews, that is to say, for with the other kind we are not concerned \u2014 those who could not endure any oddity or eccentricity of appearance (as Bloch repelled Al-bertine). Generally speaking, one realised afterwards that if they had against them hair worn too long, noses and eyes that were too big, stilted theatrical gestures, it was puerile to judge them by these only, they had plenty of intelligence and spirit and were men to whom, in the long run, one could become closely attached. Among the Jews especially there were few whose parents and kinsfolk had not a warmth of heart, a breadth of mind in comparison with which Saint-Loup\u2019s mother and the Duc de Guermantes cut the poorest of figures by their sereness, their skin-deep religiosity which denounced only the most open scandals, their apology for a Christianity which led invariably (by the unexpected channel of a purely calculating mind) to an enormously wealthy marriage. But in Saint-Loup, when all was said, however the faults of his relatives might be combined in a fresh creation of character, there reigned the most charming openness of mind and heart. And whenever (it must be frankly admitted, to the undying glory of France) these qualities are found in a man who is purely French, be he noble or plebeian, they flower \u2014 flourish would be too strong a word, for a sense of proportion persists and also a certain restraint \u2014 with a grace which the foreign visitor, however estimable he may be, does not present to us. Of these intellectual and moral qualities others undoubtedly have their share, and if we have first to overcome what repels us and what makes us smile they remain no less precious. But it is all the same a pleasant thing, and one which is perhaps exclusively French that what is fine from the standpoint of equity, what is of value to the heart and mind should be first of all attractive to the eyes, charmingly coloured, consummately chiselled, should express outwardly as well in substance as in form an inward perfection. I studied Saint-Loup\u2019s features and said to myself that it is a thing to be glad of when there is no lack of bodily grace to prepare one for the graces within, and when the winged nostrils are spread as delicately and with as perfect a design as the wings of the little butterflies that hover over the field-flowers round Combray; and that the true opus francigenum, the secret of which was not lost in the thirteenth century, the beauty of which would not be lost with the destruction of our churches, consists not so much in the stone angels of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs as in the young sons of France, noble, citizen or peasant, whose faces are carved with that delicacy and boldness which have remained as traditional there as on the famous porch, but are creative still as well\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After leaving us for a moment in order to supervise personally the barring of the door and the ordering of our dinner (he laid great stress on our choosing \u2018butcher\u2019s meat,\u2019 the fowls being presumably nothing to boast of) the proprietor came back to inform us that M. le Prince de Foix would esteem it a favour if M. le Marquis would allow him to dine at a table next to ours. \u201cBut they are all taken,\u201d objected Robert, casting an eye over the tables which blocked the way to mine. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter in the least, if M. le Marquis would like it, I can easily ask these people to move to another table. It is always a pleasure to do anything for M. le Marquis!\u201d \u201cBut you must decide,\u201d said Saint-Loup to me. \u201cFoix is a good fellow, he may bore you or he may not; anyhow he\u2019s not such a fool as most of them.\u201d I told Robert that of course I should like to meet his friend but that now that I was for once in a way dining with him and was so entirely happy, I should be just as well pleased to have him all to myself. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very fine cloak, the Prince has,\u201d the proprietor broke in upon our deliberation. \u201cYes, I know,\u201d said Saint-Loup. I wanted to tell Robert that M. de Charlus had disclaimed all knowledge of me to his sister-in-law, and to ask him what could be the reason of this, but was prevented by the arrival of M. de Foix. Come to see whether his request had been favourably received, we caught sight of him standing beside our table. Robert introduced us, but did not hide from his friend that as we had things to talk about he would prefer not to be disturbed. The Prince withdrew, adding to the farewell bow which he made me a smile which, pointed at Saint-Loup, seemed to transfer to him the responsibility for the shortness of a meeting which the Prince himself would have liked to see prolonged. As he turned to go, Robert, struck, it appeared, by a sudden idea, dashed off after his friend, with a \u201cStay where you are and get on with your dinner, I shall be back in a moment,\u201d to me; and vanished into the smaller room. I was pained to hear the smart young men sitting near me, whom I did not know, repeat the most absurd and malicious stories about the young Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg (formerly Comte de Nassau) whom I had met at Balbec and who had shewn me such delicate marks of sympathy at the time of my grandmother\u2019s illness. According to one of these young me he had said to the Duchesse de Guermantes: \u201cI expect everyone to get up when my wife passes,\u201d to which the Duchess had retorted (with as little truth, had she said any such thing, as humour, the grandmother of the young Princess having always been the very pink of propriety): \u201cGet up when your wife passes, do they? Well, that\u2019s a change from her grandmother\u2019s day. She expected the gentlemen to lie down.\u201d Then some one alleged that, having gone down to see his aunt the Princesse de Luxembourg at Balbec, and put up at the Grand Hotel, he had complained to the manager there (my friend) that the royal standard of Luxembourg was not flown in front of the hotel, over the sea. And that this flag being less familiar and less generally in use than the British or Italian, it had taken him several days to procure one, greatly to the young Grand Duke\u2019s annoyance. I did not believe a word of this story, but made up my mind, as soon as I went to Balbec, to inquire of the manager, so as to make certain that it was a pure invention. While waiting for Saint-Loup to return I asked the proprietor to get me some bread. \u201cCertainly, Monsieur le Baron!\u201d \u201cI am not a Baron,\u201d I told him. \u201cOh, beg pardon, Monsieur le Comte!\u201d I had no time to lodge a second protest which would certainly have promoted me to the rank of marquis; faithful to his promise of an immediate return, Saint-Loup reappeared in the doorway carrying over his arm the thick vicuna cloak of the Prince de Foix, from whom I guessed that he had borrowed it in order to keep me warm. He signed to me not to get up, and came towards me, but either my table would have to be moved again or I must change my seat if he was to get to his. Entering the big room he sprang lightly on to one of the red plush benches which ran round its walls and on which, apart from myself, there were sitting only three or four of the young men from the Jockey Club, friends of his own, who had not managed to find places in the other room. Between the tables and the wall electric wires were stretched at a certain height; without the least hesitation Saint-Loup jumped nimbly over them like a horse in a steeplechase; embarrassed that it should be done wholly for my benefit and to save me the trouble of a slight movement, I was at the same time amazed at the precision with which my friend performed this exercise in l\u00e9vitation; and in this I was not alone; for, albeit they would probably have had but little admiration for a similar display on the part of a more humbly born and less generous client, the proprietor and his staff stood fascinated, like racegoers in the enclosure; one underling, apparently rooted to the ground, stood there gaping with a dish in his hand for which a party close beside him were waiting; and when Saint-Loup, having to get past his friends, climbed on the narrow ledge behind them and ran along it, balancing himself with his arms, discreet applause broke from the body of the room. On coming to where I was sitting he stopped short in his advance with the precision of a tributary chieftain before the throne of a sovereign, and, stooping down, handed to me with an air of courtesy and submission the vicuna cloak which, a moment later, having taken his place beside me, without my having to make a single movement he arranged as a light but warm shawl about my shoulders\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBy the way, while I think of it, my uncle Charlus has something to say to you. I promised I\u2019d send you round to him to-morrow evening.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just going to speak to you about him. But to-morrow evening I am dining with your aunt Guermantes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes there\u2019s a regular beanfeast to-morrow at Oriane\u2019s. I\u2019m not asked. But my uncle Palam\u00e8de doesn\u2019t want you to go there. You can\u2019t get out of it, I suppose? Well, anyhow, go on to my uncle\u2019s afterwards. I\u2019m sure he really does want to see you. Look here, you can easily manage to get there by eleven. Eleven o\u2019clock; don\u2019t forget; I\u2019ll let him know. He\u2019s very touchy. If you don\u2019t turn up he\u2019ll never forgive you. And Oriane\u2019s parties are always over quite early. If you are only going to dine there you can quite easily be at my uncle\u2019s by eleven. I ought really to go and see Oriane, about getting shifted from Morocco; I want an exchange. She is so nice about all that sort of thing, and she can get anything she likes out of General de Saint-Joseph, who runs that branch. But don\u2019t say anything about it to her. I\u2019ve mentioned it to the Princesse de Parme, everything will be all right. Interesting place, Morocco. I could tell you all sorts of things. Very fine lot of men out there. One feels they\u2019re on one\u2019s own level, mentally.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t think the Germans are going to go to war about it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; they\u2019re annoyed with us, as after all they have every right to be. But the Emperor is out for peace. They are always making us think they want war, to force us to give in. Pure bluff, you know, like poker. The Prince of Monaco, one of Wilhelm\u2019s agents, comes and tells us in confidence that Germany will attack us. Then we give way. But if we didn\u2019t give way, there wouldn\u2019t be war in any shape or form. You have only to think what a comic spectacle a war would be in these days. It\u2019d be a bigger catastrophe than the Flood and the G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung rolled in one. Only it wouldn\u2019t last so long.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He spoke to me of friendship, affection, regret, albeit like all visitors of his sort he was going off the next morning for some months, which he was to spend in the country, and would only be staying a couple of nights in Paris on his way back to Morocco (or elsewhere); but the words which he thus let fall into the heated furnace which my heart was this evening kindled a pleasant glow there. Our infrequent meetings, this one in particular, have since formed a distinct episode in my memories. For him, as for me, this was the evening of friendship. And yet the friendship that I felt for him at this moment was scarcely, I feared (and felt therefore some remorse at the thought), what he would have liked to inspire. Filled still with the pleasure that I had had in seeing him come bounding towards me and gracefully pause on arriving at his goal, I felt that this pleasure lay in my recognising that each of the series of movements which he had developed against the wall, along the bench, had its meaning, its cause in Saint-Loup\u2019s own personal nature, possibly, but even more in that which by birth and upbringing he had inherited from his race\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A certainty of taste in the region not of beauty but manners, which when he was faced by a novel combination of circumstances enabled the man of breeding to grasp at once \u2014 like a musician who has been asked to play a piece he has never seen \u2014 the feeling, the motions that were required, and to apply the appropriate mechanism and technique; which then allowed this taste to display itself without the constraint of any other consideration, by which the average young man of the middle class would have been paralysed, from fear as well of making himself ridiculous in the eyes of strangers by his disregard of convention as of appearing too deferential in the eyes of his friends; the place of this constraint being taken in Robert by a lofty disdain which certainly he had never felt in his heart but which he had received by inheritance in his body, and which had moulded the attitudes of his ancestors to a familiarity with their inferiors which, they imagined, could only flatter and enchant those to whom it was displayed; lastly, a noble liberality which, taking no account of his boundless natural advantages (lavish expenditure in this restaurant had succeeded in making him, here as elsewhere, the most fashionable customer and the general favourite, a position which was underlined by the deference shewn him throughout the place not only by the waiters but by all its most exclusive young patrons), led him to trample them underfoot, just as he had, actually and symbolically, trodden upon those benches decked with purple, like a triumphal way which pleased my friend only because it enabled him more gracefully and swiftly to arrive at my side; such were the qualities, essential to aristocracy, which through the husk of this body, not opaque and vague as mine would have been, but significant and limpid, transmitted as through a work of art the industrious, energetic force which had created it and rendered the movements of this lightfoot course which Robert had pursued along the wall intelligible and charming as those of a row of knights upon a marble frieze. \u201cAlas!\u201d Robert might have thought, \u201cwas it worth while to have grown up despising birth, honouring only justice and intellect, choosing outside the ranks of the friends provided for me companions who were awkward and ill-dressed, provided they had the gift of eloquence, only for the sole personality apparent in me, which is to remain a treasured memory, to be not that which my will, with the most praiseworthy effort, has fashioned in my likeness, but one which is not of my making, which is not even myself, which I have always disliked and striven to overcome; was it worth while to love my chosen friend as I have loved him, for the greatest pleasure that he can find in me to be that of discovering something far more general than myself, a pleasure which is not in the least (as he says, though he cannot seriously believe it) one of the pleasures of friendship, but an intellectual and detached, a sort of artistic pleasure?\u201d This is what I am now afraid that Saint-Loup may at times have thought. If so, he was mistaken. If he had not (as he steadfastly had) cherished something more lofty than the suppleness innate in his body, if he had not kept aloof for so long from the pride that goes with noble birth, there would have been something more studied, a certain heaviness in his very agility, a self-important vulgarity in his manners. As with Mme. de Villeparisis a strong vein of seriousness had been necessary for her to give in her conversation and in her Memoirs a sense of the frivolous, which is intellectual, so, in order that Saint-Loup\u2019s body might be indwelt by so much nobility, the latter had first to desert a mind that was aiming at higher things, and, reabsorbed into his body, to be fixed there in unconscious, noble lines. In this way his distinction of mind was not absent from a bodily distinction which otherwise would not have been complete. An artist has no need to express his mind directly in his work for it to express the quality of that mind; it has indeed been said that the highest praise of God consists in the denial of Him by the atheist, who finds creation so perfect that it can dispense with a creator. And I was quite well aware that it was not merely a work of art that I was admiring in this young man unfolding along the wall the frieze of his flying course; the young Prince (a descendant of Catherine de Foix, Queen of Navarre and grand-daughter of Charles VII) whom he had just left for my sake, the endowments, by birth and fortune, which he was laying at my feet, the proud and shapely ancestors who survived in the assurance, the agility, the courtesy with which he now arranged about my shivering body the warm woollen cloak, were not all these like friends of longer standing in his life, by whom I might have expected that we should be permanently kept apart, and whom, on the contrary, he was sacrificing to me by a choice which one can make only in the loftiest places of the mind, with that sovereign liberty of which Robert\u2019s movements were the presentment and in which is realised perfect friendship?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How much familiar intercourse with a Guermantes \u2014 in place of the distinction that it had in Robert, because there the inherited scorn of humanity was but the outer garment, become an unconscious charm, of a real moral humility \u2014 could disclose of vulgar arrogance I had had an opportunity of seeing, not in M. de Charlus, in whom certain characteristic faults, for which I had been unable, so far, to account, were overlaid upon his aristocratic habits, but in the Duc de Guermantes. And yet he too, in the general impression of commonness which had so strongly repelled my grandmother when she had met him once, years earlier, at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, included glimpses of historic grandeur of which I became conscious when I went to dine in his house, on the evening following that which I had spent with Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They had not been apparent to me either in himself or in the Duchess when I had met them first in their aunt\u2019s drawing-room, any more than I had discerned, on first seeing her, the differences that set Berma apart from her fellow-players, all the more that in her the individuality was infinitely more striking than in any social celebrity, such distinctions becoming more marked in proportion as the objects are more real, more conceivable by the intellect. And yet, however slight the shades of social distinction may be (and so slight are they that when an accurate portrayer like Sainte-Beuve tries to indicate the shades of difference between the salons of Mme. Geoffrin, Mme. R\u00e9camier and Mme. de Boigne, they appear so much alike that the cardinal truth which, unknown to the author, emerges from his investigations is the vacuity of that form of life), with them, and for the same reason as with Berma, when the Guermantes had ceased to impress me and the tiny drop of their originality was no longer vaporised by my imagination, I was able to distil and analyse it, imponderable as it was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess having made no reference to her husband when she talked to me at her aunt\u2019s party, I wondered whether, in view of the rumours of a divorce that were current, he would be present at the dinner. But my doubts were speedily set at rest, for through the crowd of footmen who stood about in the hall and who (since they must until then have regarded me much as they regarded the children of the evicted cabinet-maker, that is to say with more fellow-feeling perhaps than their master but as a person incapable of being admitted to his house) must have been asking themselves to what this social revolution could be due, I saw slip towards me M. de Guermantes himself, who had been watching for my arrival so as to receive me upon his threshold and take off my greatcoat with his own hands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMme. de Guermantes will be as pleased as punch,\u201d he greeted me in a glibly persuasive tone. \u201cLet me help you off with your duds.\u201d (He felt it to be at once companionable and comic to employ the speech of the people.) \u201cMy wife was just the least bit afraid you might fail us, although you had fixed a date. We\u2019ve been saying to each other all day long: \u2018Depend upon it, he\u2019ll never turn up.\u2019 I am bound to say, Mme. de Guermantes was a better prophet than I was. You are not an easy man to get hold of, and I was quite sure you were going to play us false.\u201d And the Duke was so bad a husband, so brutal even (people said), that one felt grateful to him, as one feels grateful to wicked people for their occasional kindness of heart, for those words \u2018Mme. de Guermantes\u2019 with which he appeared to be spreading out over the Duchess a protecting wing, that she might be but one flesh with him. Meanwhile, taking me familiarly by the hand, he began to lead the way, to introduce me into his household. Just as some casual phrase may delight us coming from the lips of a peasant if it points to the survival of a local tradition, shews the trace of some historic event unknown, it may be, to him who thus alludes to it; so this politeness on the part of M. de Guermantes, which, moreover, he was to continue to shew me throughout the evening, charmed me as a survival of habits of many centuries\u2019 growth, habits of the seventeenth century in particular. The people of bygone ages seem to us infinitely remote. We do not feel justified in ascribing to them any underlying intention apart from those to which they give formal expression; we are amazed when we come upon a sentiment more or less akin to what we are feeling to-day in a Homeric hero, or upon a skilful tactical feint in Hannibal, during the buttle of Cannae, where he let his flank be driven back in order to take the enemy by surprise and surround him; it would seem that we imagined the epic poet and the Punic general as being as remote from ourselves as an animal seen in a zoological garden. Even in certain personages of the court of Louis XIV, when we find signs of courtesy in the letters written by them to some man of inferior rank who could be of no service to them whatever, they leave us bewildered because they reveal to us suddenly, as existing among these great gentlemen, a whole world of beliefs to which they never give any direct expression but which govern their conduct, and especially the belief that they are bound in politeness to feign certain sentiments and to carry out with the most scrupulous care certain obligations of friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This imagined remoteness of the past is perhaps one of the things that enable us to understand how even great writers have found an inspired beauty in the works of mediocre mystifiers, such as Macpherson\u2019s Ossian. We so little expected to learn that bards long dead could have modern ideas that we marvel if in what we believe to be an ancient Gaelic ode we come upon one which we should have thought, at the most, ingenious in a contemporary. A translator of talent has simply to add to an ancient writer whom he presents to us more or less faithfully reproduced fragments which, signed with a contemporary name and published separately, would seem entertaining only; at once he imparts a moving grandeur to his poet, who is thus made to play upon the keyboards of several ages at once. This translator was capable only of a mediocre book, if that book had been published as his original work. Given out as a translation, it seems that of a masterpiece. The past not merely is not fugitive, it remains present. It is not within a few months only after the outbreak of a war that laws passed without haste can effectively influence its course, it is not within fifteen years only after a crime which has remained obscure that a magistrate can still find the vital evidence which will throw a light on it; after hundreds and thousands of years the scholar who has been studying in a distant land the place-names, the customs of the inhabitants, may still extract from them some legend long anterior to the Christian era, already unintelligible, if not actually forgotten, at the time of Herodotus, which in the name given to a rock, in a religious rite, dwells surrounded by the present, like an emanation of greater density, immemorial and stable. There was similarly an emanation, though far less ancient, of the life of the court, if not in the manners of M. de Guermantes, which were often vulgar, at least in the mind that controlled them. I was to breathe this again, like the odour of antiquity, when I joined him a little later in the drawing-room. For I did not go there at once\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we left the outer hall, I had mentioned to M. de Guermantes that I was extremely anxious to see his Elstirs. \u201cI am at your service. Is M. Elstir a friend of yours, then? If so, it is most vexing, for I know him slightly; he is a pleasant fellow, what our fathers used to call an \u2018honest fellow\u2019; I might have asked him to honour us with his company, and to dine tonight. I am sure he would have been highly flattered at being invited to spend the evening in your society.\u201d Very little suggestive of the old order when he tried thus to assume its manner, the Duke relapsed unconsciously into it. After inquiring whether I wished him to shew me the pictures, he conducted me to them, gracefully standing aside for me at each door, apologising when, to shew me the way, he was obliged to precede me, a little scene which (since the days when Saint-Simon relates that an ancestor of the Guermantes did him the honours of his town house with the same punctilious exactitude in the performance of the frivolous duties of a gentleman) must, before coming gradually down to us, have been enacted by many other Guermantes for numberless other visitors. And as I had said to the Duke that I would like very much to be left alone for a few minutes with the pictures, he discreetly withdrew, telling me that I should find him in the drawing-room when I was ready\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only, once I was face to face with the Elstirs, I completely forgot about dinner and the time; here again as at Balbec I had before me fragments of that strangely coloured world which was no more than the projection, the way of seeing things peculiar to that great painter, which his speech in no way expressed. The parts of the walls that were covered by paintings from his brush, all homogeneous with one another, were like the luminous images of a magic lantern, which would have been in this instance the brain of the artist, and the strangeness of which one could never have suspected so long as one had known only the man, which was like seeing the iron lantern boxing its lamp before any coloured slide had been slid into its groove. Among these pictures several of the kind that seemed most absurd to ordinary people interested me more than the rest because they recreated those optical illusions which prove to us that we should never succeed in identifying objects if we did not make some process of reasoning intervene How often, when driving in the dark, do we not come upon a long, lighted street which begins a few feet away from us, when what we have actually before our eyes is nothing but a rectangular patch of wall with a bright light falling on it, which has given us the mirage of depth. In view of which is it not logical, not by any artifice of symbolism but by a sincere return to the very root of the impression, to represent one thing by that other for which, in the flash of a first illusion, we mistook it? Surfaces and volumes are in reality independent of the names of objects which our memory imposes on them after we have recognised them. Elstir attempted to wrest from what he had just felt what he already knew, his effort had often been to break up that aggregate of impressions which we call vision\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The people who detested these \u2018horrors\u2019 were astonished to find that Elstir admired Chardin, Perroneau, any number of painters whom they, the ordinary men and women of society, liked. They did not take into account that Elstir had had to make, for his own part, in striving to reproduce reality (with the particular index of his taste for certain lines of approach), the same effort as a Chardin or a Perroneau and that consequently, when he ceased to work for himself, he admired in them attempts of the same order, fragments anticipatory so to speak of works of his own. Nor did these society people include in their conception of Elstir\u2019s work that temporal perspective which enabled them to like, or at least to look without discomfort at Chardin\u2019s painting. And yet the older among them might have reminded themselves that in the course of their lives they had seen gradually, as the years bore them away from it, the unbridgeable gulf between what they considered a masterpiece by Ingres and what, they had supposed, must remain for ever a \u2018horror\u2019 (Manet\u2019sOlympia, for example) shrink until the two canvases seemed like twins. But we learn nothing from any lesson because we have not the wisdom to work backwards from the particular to the general, and imagine ourselves always to be going through an experience which is without precedents in the past\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was moved by the discovery in two of the pictures (more realistic, these, and in an earlier manner) of the same person, in one in evening dress in his own drawing-room, in the other wearing a frock coat and tall hat at some popular regatta where he had evidently no business to be, which proved that for Elstir he was not only a regular sitter but a friend, perhaps a patron whom it pleased him (just as Carpaccio used to introduce prominent figures, and in speaking likenesses, from contemporary life in Venice) to introduce into his pictures, just as Beethoven, too, found pleasure in inscribing at the top of a favourite work the beloved name of the Archduke Rudolph. There was something enchanting about this waterside carnival. The river, the women\u2019s dresses, the sails of the boats, the innumerable reflexions of one thing and another came crowding into this little square panel of beauty which Elstir had cut out of a marvellous afternoon. What delighted one in the dress of a woman who had stopped for a moment in the dance because it was hot and she was out of breath was irresistible also in the same way in the canvas of a motionless sail, in the water of the little harbour, in the wooden bridge, in the leaves of the trees and in the sky. As in one of the pictures that I had seen at Balbec, the hospital, as beautiful beneath its sky of lapis lazuli as the cathedral itself, seemed (more bold than Elstir the theorician, then Elstir the man of taste, the lover of things mediaeval) to be intoning: \u201cThere is no such thing as gothic, there is no such thing as a masterpiece; this tasteless hospital is just as good as the glorious porch,\u201d so I now heard: \u201cThe slightly vulgar lady at whom a man of discernment would refrain from glancing as he passed her by, would except from the poetical composition which nature has set before him \u2014 her dress is receiving the same light as the sail of that boat, and there are no degrees of value and beauty; the commonplace dress and the sail, beautiful in itself, are two mirrors reflecting the same gleam; the value is all in the painter\u2019s eye.\u201d This eye had had the skill to arrest for all time the motion of the hours at this luminous instant, when the lady had felt hot and had stopped dancing, when the tree was fringed with a belt of shadow, when the sails seemed to be slipping over a golden glaze. But just because the depicted moment pressed on one with so much force, this so permanent canvas gave one the most fleeting impression, one felt that the lady would presently move out of it, the boats drift away, the night draw on, that pleasure comes to an end, that life passes and that the moments illuminated by the convergence, at once, of so many lights do not recur. I recognized yet another aspect, quite different it is true, of what the moment means in a series of water-colours of mythological subjects, dating from Elstir\u2019s first period, which also adorned this room. Society people who held \u2018advanced\u2019 views on art went \u2018as far as\u2019 this earliest manner, but no further. These were certainly not the best work that he had done, but already the sincerity with which the subject had been thought out melted its natural coldness. Thus the Muses, for instance, were represented as it might be creatures belonging to a species now fossilised, but creatures which it would not have been surprising in mythological times to see pass in the evening, in twos or threes, along some mountain path. Here and there a poet, of a race that had also a peculiar interest for the zoologist (characterised by a certain sexlessness) strolled with a Muse, as one sees in nature creatures of different but of kindred species consort together. In one of these water-colours one saw a poet wearied by long wanderings on the mountains, whom a Centaur, meeting him and moved to pity by his weakness, had taken on his back and was carrying home. In more than one other, the vast landscape (in which the mythical scene, the fabulous heroes, occupied a minute place and were almost lost) was rendered, from the mountain tops to the sea, with an exactitude which told one more than the hour, told one to the very minute what time of day ft was, thanks to the precise angle of the setting sun, to the fleeting fidelity of the shadows. In this way the artist managed to give, by making it instantaneous, a sort of historical reality, as of a thing actually lived, to the symbol of his fable, painted it and set it at a definite point in the past\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I was examining Elstir\u2019s paintings the bell, rung by arriving guests had been pealing uninterruptedly, and had lulled me into a pleasing unconsciousness. But the silence which followed its clangour and had already lasted for some time succeeded \u2014 less rapidly, it is true \u2014 in awakening me from my dream, as the silence that follows Lindor\u2019s music arouses Bartolo from his sleep. I was afraid that I had been forgotten, that they had sat down to dinner, and hurried to the drawing-room. At the door of the Elstir gallery I found a servant waiting for me, white-haired, though whether with age or powder I cannot say, with the air of a Spanish Minister, but treating me with the same respect that he would have shewn to a King. I felt from his manner that he must have been waiting for at least an hour, and I thought with alarm of the delay I had caused in the service of dinner, especially as I had promised to be at M. de Charlus\u2019s by eleven\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Spanish Minister (though I also met on the way the footman persecuted by the porter, who, radiant with delight when I inquired after his girl, told me that the very next day they were both to be off duty, so that he would be able to spend the whole day with her, and extolled the generosity of Madame la Duchesse) conducted me to the drawing-room, where I was afraid of finding M. de Guermantes in an ill humour. He welcomed me, on the contrary, with a joy that was evidently to a certain extent artificial and dictated by politeness, but was also sincere, prompted both by his stomach which so long a delay had begun to famish, and his consciousness of a similar impatience in all his other guests, who completely filled the room. Indeed I heard afterwards that I had kept them waiting for nearly three-quarters of an hour. The Duc de Guermantes probably thought that to prolong the general torment for two minutes more would not intensify it and that, politeness having driven him to postpone for so long the moment of moving into the dining-room, this politeness would be more complete if, by not having dinner announced immediately, he could succeed in persuading me that I was not late, and that they had not been waiting for me. And so he asked me, as if we had still an hour before dinner and some of the party had not yet arrived, what I thought of his Elstirs. But at the same time, and without letting the cravings of his stomach become apparent, so as not to lose another moment, he, in concert with the Duchess, proceeded to the ceremony of introduction. Then only I perceived that there had occurred round about me, me who until this evening, save for my novitiate in Mme. Swann\u2019s drawing-room, had been accustomed, in my mother\u2019s homes, at Combray and in Paris, to the manners, either protecting or defensive, of the grim ladies of our middle-world, who treated me as a child, a change of surroundings comparable to that which introduces Parsifal suddenly into the midst of the Flower-Maidens. Those who surrounded me now, their bosoms entirely bare (the naked flesh appeared on either side of a sinuous spray of mimosa or behind the broad petals of a rose) could not murmur a word of greeting without at the same time bathing me in long, caressing glances, as though shyness alone restrained them from kissing me. Many of them were nevertheless highly respectable from the moral standpoint; many, not all, for the most virtuous had not for those of a lighter vein the same repulsion that my mother would have felt. The caprices of one\u2019s conduct, denied by saintlier friends, in the face of the evidence, seemed in the Guermantes world to matter far less than the relations which one had been able to maintain. One pretended not to know that the body of one\u2019s hostess was at the disposal of all comers, provided that her visiting list showed no gaps. As the Duke put himself out not at all for his other guests (of whom he had long known everything that there was to know, and they of him) but quite markedly for me, whose kind of superiority, being outside his experience, inspired in him something akin to the respect which the great nobleman of the court of Louis XIV used to feel for his plebeian Ministers, he evidently considered that the fact of my not knowing his other guests mattered not at all \u2014 to me at least, though it might to them \u2014 and while I was anxious, on his account, as to the impression that I was going to make on them he was thinking only of how his friends would impress me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the very outset I found myself completely bewildered. No sooner had I entered the drawing-room than M. de Guermantes, without even allowing me time to shake hands with the Duchess, had led me, as though I were a delightful surprise to the person in question to whom he seemed to be saying: \u201cHere\u2019s your friend! You see, I\u2019m bringing him to you by the scruff of his neck,\u201d towards a lady of smallish stature. Whereupon, long before, thrust forward by the Duke, I had reached her chair, the lady had begun to flash at me continuously from her large, soft, dark eyes the thousand smiles of understanding which we address to an old friend who perhaps has not recognised us. As this was precisely my case and I could not succeed in calling to mind who she was I averted my eyes from her as I approached so as not to have to respond until our introduction should have released me from my predicament. Meanwhile the lady continued to maintain in unstable equilibrium the smile intended for myself. She looked as though she were anxious to be relieved of it and to hear me say: \u201cOh, but this is a pleasure! Mamma will be pleased when I tell her I\u2019ve met you!\u201d I was as impatient to learn her name as she was to see that I did finally greet her, fully aware of what I was doing, so that the smile which she was holding on indefinitely, like the note of a tuning-fork, might at length be let go. But M. de Guermantes managed things so badly (to my mind, at least) that I seemed to have heard only my own name uttered and was given no clue to the identity of my unknown friend, to whom it never occurred to tell me herself what her name was, so obvious did the grounds of our intimacy, which baffled me completely, seem to her. Indeed, as soon as I had come within reach, she did not offer me her hand, but took mine in a familiar clasp, and spoke to me exactly as though I had been equally conscious with herself of the pleasant memories to which her mind reverted. She told me how sorry Albert (who, I gathered, was her son) would be to have missed seeing me. I tried to remember who, among the people I had known as boys, was called Albert, and could think only of Bloch, but this could not be Bloch\u2019s mother that I saw before me since she had been dead for some time. In vain I struggled to identify the past experience common to herself and me to which her thoughts had been carried back. But I could no more distinguish it through the translucent jet of her large, soft pupils which allowed only her smile to pierce their surface than one can distinguish a landscape that lies on the other side of a smoked glass, even when the sun is blazing on it. She asked me whether my father was not working too hard, if I would not come to the theatre some evening with Albert, if I was stronger now, and as my replies, stumbling through the mental darkness in which I was plunged, became distinct only to explain that I was not feeling well that evening, she pushed forward a chair for me herself, going to all sorts of trouble which I was not accustomed to see taken by my parents\u2019 friends. At length the clue to the riddle was furnished me by the Duke: \u201cShe thinks you\u2019re charming,\u201d he murmured in my ear, which felt somehow that it had heard these words before. They were what Mme. de Villeparisis had said to my grandmother and myself after we had made the acquaintance of the Princesse de Luxembourg. Everything became clear; the lady I now saw had nothing in common with Mme. de Luxembourg, but from the language of him who thus served me with her I could discern the nature of the animal. It was a Royalty. She had never before heard of either my family or myself, but, a scion of the noblest race and endowed with the greatest fortune in the world (for, a daughter of the Prince de Parme, she had married a cousin of equal princelihood), she sought always, in gratitude to her Creator, to testify to her neighbour, however poor or lowly he might be, that she did not look down upon him. Really, I might have guessed this from her smile. I had seen the Princesse de Luxembourg buy little rye-cakes on the beach at Balbec to give to my grandmother, as though to a caged deer in the zoological garden. But this was only the second Princess of the Blood Royal to whom I had been presented, and I might be excused my failure to discern in her the common factors of the friendliness of the great. Besides, had not they themselves gone out of their way to warn me not to count too much on this friendliness, since the Duchesse de Guermantes, who had waved me so effusive a greeting with her gloved hand at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, had appeared furious when I bowed to her in the street, like people who, having once given somebody a sovereign, feel that this has set them free from any further obligation toward him. As for M. de Charlus, his ups and downs were even more sharply contrasted. While in the sequel I have known, as the reader will learn, Highnesses and Majesties of another sort altogether, Queens who play the Queen and speak not after the conventions of their kind but like the Queens in Sardou\u2019s plays\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If M. de Guermantes had been in such haste to present me, it was because the presence at a party of anyone not personally known to a Royal Personage is an intolerable state of things which must not be prolonged for a single instant. It was similar to the haste which Saint-Loup had shewn in making me introduce him to my grandmother. By the same token, by a fragmentary survival of the old life of the court which is called social courtesy and is not superficial, in which, rather, by a centripetal reversion, it is the surface that becomes essential and profound, the Due and Duchesse de Guermantes regarded as a duty more essential than those (which one at least of the pair neglected often enough) of charity, chastity, pity and justice, as a more unalterable law that of never addressing the Princesse de Parme save in the third person\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having never yet in my life been to Parma (a pilgrimage I had been anxious to make ever since certain Easter holidays long ago), to meet its Princess, who, I knew, owned the finest palace in that matchless city, where, moreover, everything must be in keeping, isolated as it was from the rest of the world, within the polished walls, in the atmosphere, stifling as a breathless summer evening on the Piazza of a small town in Italy, of its compact and almost cloying name, would surely have substituted in a flash for what I had so often tried to imagine all that did really exist at Parma in a sort of partial arrival there, without my having to stir from Paris, of myself; it was in the algebraical expression of a journey to the city of Correggio a simple equation, so to speak, of that unknown quantity. But if I had for many years past \u2014 like a perfumer impregnating a solid mass of grease with scent \u2014 made this name, Princesse de Parme, absorb the fragrance of thousands of violets, in return, when I set eyes on the Princess, who, until then I should have sworn, must be the Sanseverina herself, a second process began which was not, I may say, completed until several months had passed, and consisted in expelling, by means of fresh chemical combinations, all the essential oil of violets and all the Stendhalian fragrance from the name of the Princess, and in implanting there, in their place, the image of a little dark woman, taken up with good works, of a friendliness so humble that one felt at once in how exalted a pride that friendliness had its roots. Moreover, while, barring a few points of difference, she was exactly like any other great lady, she was as little Stendhalian as is, for example, in Paris, in the Europe quarter, the Rue de Parme, which bears far less resemblance to the name of Parma than to any or all of the neighbouring streets, and reminds one not nearly so much of the Charterhouse in which Fabrice ends his days as of the waiting room in the Saint-Lazare station\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her friendliness sprang from two causes. The first and more general was the education which this daughter of Kings had received. Her mother (not merely allied by blood to all the royal families of Europe but furthermore \u2014 in contrast to the Ducal House of Parma \u2014 richer than any reigning Princess) had instilled into her from her earliest childhood the arrogantly humble precepts of an evangelical snobbery; and to-day every line of the daughter\u2019s face, the curve of her shoulders, the movements of her arms seemed to repeat the lesson: \u201cRemember that if God has caused you to be born on the steps of a throne you ought not to make that a reason for looking down upon those to whom Divine Providence has willed (wherefore His Name be praised) that you should be superior by birth and fortune. On the contrary, you must suffer the little ones. Your ancestors were Princes of Treves and Juliers from the year 647: God has decreed in His bounty that you should hold practically all the shares in the Suez Canal and three times as many Royal Dutch as Edmond de Rothschild; your pedigree in a direct line has been established by genealogists from the year 63 of the Christian Era; you have as sisters-in-law two Empresses. Therefore never seem, in your speech, to be recalling these great privileges, not that they are precarious (for nothing can alter antiquity of race, while the world will always need petrol), but because it is useless to point out that you are better born than other people or that your investments are all gilt-edged, since everyone knows these facts already. Be helpful to the needy. Furnish to all those whom the bounty of Heaven has done you the favour of placing beneath you as much as you can give them without forfeiture of your rank, that is to say help in the form of money, even your personal service by their sickbeds, but never (bear well in mind) invite them to your parties, which would do them no possible good and, by weakening your own position, would diminish the efficacy of your benevolent activities.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so even at the moments when she could not do good the Princess endeavoured to shew, or rather to let it be thought, by all the external signs of dumb language, that she did not consider herself superior to the people among whom she found herself thrown. She treated each of them with that charming courtesy with which well-bred people treat their inferiors and was continually, to make herself useful, pushing back her chair so as to leave more room, holding my gloves, offering me all those services which would demean the proud spirit of a commoner but are very willingly rendered by sovereign ladies or, instinctively and by force of professional habit, by retired servants\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But already the Duke, who seemed in a hurry to complete the round of introduction, had led me off to another of the flower-maidens. On hearing her name I told her that I had passed by her country house, not far from Balbec. \u201cOh, I should have been so pleased to take you over it,\u201d she informed me, almost in a whisper, to enhance her modesty, but in a tone of deep feeling, steeped in regret for the loss of an opportunity to enjoy a quite exceptional pleasure; and went on, with a meaning glance: \u201cI do hope you will come again some day. But I must say that what would interest you more still would be my aunt Brancas\u2019s place. It was built by Mansard; it is the jewel of the province.\u201d It was not only she herself who would have been glad to shew me over her house, but her aunt Brancas would have been no less delighted to do me the honours of hers, or so I was assured by this lady who thought evidently that, especially at a time when the land shewed a tendency to pass into the hands of financiers who had no knowledge of the world, it was important that the great should keep up the exalted traditions of lordly hospitality, by speeches which involved them in nothing. It was also because she sought, like everyone in her world, to say the things which would give most pleasure to the person she was addressing, to give him the highest idea of himself, to make him think that he flattered people by writing to them, that he honoured those who entertained him, that everyone was burning to know him. The desire to give other people this comforting idea of themselves does, it must be admitted, exist even among the middle classes. We find there that kindly disposition, in the form of an individual merit compensating for some other defect, not alas among the most trusty male friends but at any rate among the most agreeable female companions. But there anyhow it blooms only in isolated patches. In an important section of the aristocracy, on the other hand, this characteristic has ceased to be individual; cultivated by education, sustained by the idea of a personal greatness which can fear no humiliation, which knows no rival, is aware that by being pleasant it can make people happy and delights in doing so, it has become the generic feature of a class. And even those whom personal defects of too incompatible a kind prevent from keeping it in their hearts bear the unconscious trace of it in their vocabulary or their gesticulation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe is a very good creature,\u201d said the Duc de Guermantes, of the Princesse de Parme, \u201cand she can play the \u2018great lady\u2019 when she likes, better than anyone.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I was being introduced to the ladies, one of the gentlemen of the party had been shewing various signs of agitation: this was Comte Hannibal de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9-Consalvi. Arriving late, he had not had time to investigate the composition of the party, and when I entered the room, seeing in me a guest who was not one of the Duchess\u2019s regular circle and must therefore have some quite extraordinary claim to admission, installed his monocle beneath the groined arch of his eyebrow, thinking that this would be a great help to him in discovering what manner of man I was. He knew that Mme. de Guermantes possessed (the priceless appanage of truly superior women) what was called a \u2018salon,\u2019 that is to say added occasionally to the people of her own set some celebrity who had recently come into prominence by the discovery of a new cure for something or the production of a masterpiece. The Faubourg Saint-Germain had not yet recovered from the shock of learning that, to the reception which she had given to meet the King and Queen of England, the Duchess had not been afraid to invite M. D\u00e9taille. The clever women of the Faubourg who had not been invited were inconsolable, so deliciously thrilling would it have been to come into contact with that strange genius. Mme. de Courvoisier made out that M. Ribot had been there as well, but this was a pure invention, designed to make people believe that Oriane was aiming at an Embassy for her husband. Finally, a last straw of scandal, M. de Guermantes, with a gallantry that would have done credit to Marshal Saxe, had repaired to the green-room of the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise, and had begged Mlle. Reichemberg to come and recite before the King, which having come to pass constituted an event without precedent in the annals of routs. Remembering all these surprises, which, moreover, had his entire approval, his own presence being not merely an ornament but, in the same way as that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, a consecration to any drawing-room, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, when he asked himself who I could be, felt that the field of exploration was very wide. For a moment the name of M. Widor flashed before his mind, but he decided that I was not old enough to be an organist, and M. Widor not striking enough to be \u2018asked out.\u2019 It seemed on the whole more plausible to regard me simply as the new Attach\u00e9 at the Swedish Legation of whom he had heard, and he was preparing to ask me for the latest news of Oscar, by whom he had several times been very hospitably received; but when the Duke, in introducing me, had mentioned my name to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, the latter, finding that name to be completely unknown to him had no longer any doubt that, being where I was, I must be a celebrity Of some sort. Oriane would certainly never invite anyone who was not, and had the art of attracting men who were in the public eye to her house, in a ratio that of course never exceeded one per cent, otherwise she would have lowered its tone. M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 began, therefore, to lick his chops and to sniff the air greedily, his appetite whetted not only by the good dinner upon which he could count, but by the character of the party, which my presence could not fail to make interesting, and which would furnish him with a topic for brilliant conversation next day at the Duc de Chartres\u2019s luncheon-table. He had not yet settled in his own mind whether I was the man who had just been making those experiments with a serum to cure cancer, or the author of the new \u2018curtain-raiser\u2019 then in rehearsal at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais; but, a great intellectual, a great collector of \u2018travellers\u2019 tales,\u2019 he continued an ever increasing display of reverences, signs of mutual understanding, smiles filtered through the glass of his monocle; either in the mistaken idea that a man of my standing would esteem him more highly if he could manage to instil into me the illusion that for him, the Comte de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9-Consalvi, the privileges of the mind were no less deserving of respect than those of birth; or simply from the need to express and difficulty of expressing his satisfaction, in his ignorance of the language in which he ought to address me, just as if, in fact, he had found himself face to face with one of the \u2018natives\u2019 of an undiscovered country on which his keel had grounded, natives from whom, in the hope of ultimate profit, he would endeavour, observing with interest the while their quaint customs and without interrupting his demonstrations of friendship, or like them uttering loud cries, to obtain ostrich eggs and spices in exchange for his glass beads. Having responded as best I could to his joy, I shook hands next with the Duc de Chatellerault, whom I had already met at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, who, he informed me, was as \u2018cunning as they made \u2019em.\u2019 He was typically Guermantes in the fairness of his hair, his arched profile, the points where the skin of his cheeks lost colour, all of which may be seen in the portraits of that family which have come down to us from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. But, as I was no longer in love with the Duchess, her reincarnation in the person of a young man offered me no attraction. I interpreted the hook made by the Duc de Chatellerault\u2019s nose, as if it had been the signature of a painter whose work I had long studied but who no longer interested me in the least. Next, I said good evening also to the Prince de Foix, and to the detriment of my knuckles, which emerged crushed and mangled, let them be caught in a vice which was the German handclasp, accompanied by an ironical or good-natured smile, of the Prince von Faffenheim, M. de Norpois\u2019s friend, who, by virtue of the mania for nicknames which prevailed in this set, was known so universally as Prince Von that he himself used to sign his letters \u2018Prince Von,\u2019 or, when he wrote to his intimates, \u2018Von.\u2019 And yet this abbreviation was understandable, in view of his triple-barrelled name. It was less easy to grasp the reasons which made \u2018Elizabeth\u2019 be replaced, now by \u2018Lili,\u2019 now by \u2018Bebeth,\u2019 just as another world swarmed with \u2018Kikis.\u2019 One can realise that these people, albeit in most respects idle and light-minded enough, might have come to adopt \u2018Quiou\u2019 in order not to waste the precious time that it would have taken them to pronounce \u2018Montesquieu.\u2019 But it is not so easy to see what they saved by naming one of their cousins \u2018Dinand\u2019 instead of \u2018Ferdinand.\u2019 It must not be thought, however, that in the invention of nicknames the Guermantes invariably proceed to curtail or reduplicate syllables. Thus two sisters, the Comtesse de Montpeyroux and the Vicomtesse de V\u00e9lude, who were both of them enormously stout, invariably heard themselves addressed, without the least trace of annoyance on their part or of amusement on other people\u2019s, so long established was the custom, as \u2018Petite\u2019 and \u2018Mignonne.\u2019 Mme. de Guermantes, who adored Mme. de Montpeyroux, would, if her friend had been seriously ill, have flown to the sister with tears in her eyes and exclaimed: \u201cI hear Petite is dreadfully bad!\u201d Mme. de l\u2019Eclin, who wore her hair in bands that entirely hid her ears, was never called anything but \u2018The Empty Stomach\u2019; in some cases people simply added an \u2018a\u2019 to the last or first name of the husband to indicate the wife. The most miserly, most sordid, most inhuman man in the Faubourg having been christened Raphael, his charmer, his flower springing also from the rock always signed herself \u2018Raphaela\u2019\u2014 but these are merely a few specimens taken from innumerable rules, to which we can always return later on, if the occasion offers, and explain some of them. I then asked the Duke to present me to the Prince d\u2019Agrigente. \u201cWhat! Do you mean to say you don\u2019t know our excellent Gri-gri!\u201d cried M. de Guermantes, and gave M. d\u2019Agrigente my name. His own, so often quoted by Fran\u00e7oise, had always appeared to me like a transparent sheet of coloured glass through which I beheld, struck, on the shore of the violet sea, by the slanting rays of a golden sun, the rosy marble cubes of an ancient city of which I had not the least doubt that the Prince \u2014 happening for a miraculous moment to be passing through Paris \u2014 was himself, as luminously Sicilian and gloriously mellowed, the absolute sovereign. Alas, the vulgar drone to whom I was introduced, and who wheeled round to bid me good evening with a ponderous ease which he considered elegant, was as independent of his name as of any work of art that he might have owned without bearing upon his person any trace of its beauty, without, perhaps, ever having stopped to examine it. The Prince d\u2019Agrigente was so entirely devoid of anything princely, anything that might make one think of Girgenti that one was led to suppose that his name, entirely distinct from himself, bound by no ties to his person, had had the power of attracting to itself the whole of whatever vague poetical element there might have been in this man as in any other, and isolating it, after the operation, in the enchanted syllables. If any such operation had been performed, it had certainly been done most efficiently, for there remained not an atom of charm to be drawn from this kinsman of Guermantes. With the result that he found himself at one and the same time the only man in the world who was Prince d\u2019Agrigente and the man who, of all the men in the world was, perhaps, least so. He was, for all that, very glad to be what he was, but as a banker is glad to hold a number of shares in a mine without caring whether the said mine answers to the charming name of Ivanhoe or Primrose, or is called merely the Premier. Meanwhile, as these introductions, which it has taken me so long to recount but which, beginning as I entered the room, had lasted only a few seconds, were coming to an end, and Mme. de Guermantes, in an almost suppliant tone, was saying to me: \u201cI am sure Basin is tiring you, dragging you round like that; we are anxious for you to know our friends, but we are a great deal more anxious not to tire you, so that you may come again often,\u201d the Duke, with a somewhat awkward and timid wave of the hand, gave (as he would gladly have given it at any time during the last hour, filled for me by the contemplation of his Elstirs) the signal that dinner might now be served\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should add that one of the guests was still missing, M. de Grouchy, whose wife, a Guermantes by birth, had arrived by herself, her husband being due to come straight from the country, where he had been shooting all day. This M. de Grouchy, a descendant of his namesake of the First Empire, of whom it has been said, quite wrongly, that his absence at the start of the Battle of Waterloo was the principal cause of Napoleon\u2019s defeat, came of an excellent family which, however, was not good enough in the eyes of certain fanatics for blue blood. Thus the Prince de Guermantes, whose own tastes, in later life, were to prove more easily satisfied, had been in the habit of saying to his nieces: \u201cWhat a misfortune for that poor Mme. de Guermantes\u201d (the Vicomtesse de Guermantes, Mme. de Grouchy\u2019s mother) \u201cthat she has never succeeded in marrying any of her children.\u201d \u201cBut, uncle, the eldest girl married M. de Grouchy.\u201d \u201cI do not call that a husband! However, they say that your uncle Fran\u00e7ois has proposed for the youngest one, so perhaps they won\u2019t all die old maids.\u201d No sooner was the order to serve dinner given than with a vast gyratory whirr, multiple and simultaneous, the double doors of the dining-room swung apart; a chamberlain with the air of a Lord Chamberlain bowed before the Princesse de Parme and announced the tidings \u201cMadame is served,\u201d in a tone such as he would have employed to say \u201cMadame is dead,\u201d which, however, cast no gloom over the assembly for it was with an air of unrestrained gaiety and as, in summer, at \u2018Robinson\u2019 that the couples moved forward one behind another to the dining-room, separating when they had reached their places where footmen thrust their chairs in behind them; last of all, Mme. de Guermantes advanced upon me, that I might lead her to the table, and without my feeling the least shadow of the timidity that I might have feared, for, like a huntress to whom her great muscular prowess has made graceful motion an easy thing, observing no doubt that I had placed myself on the wrong side of her, she pivoted with such accuracy round me that I found her arm resting on mine and attuned in the most natural way to a rhythm of precise and noble movements. I yielded to these with all the more readiness in that the Guermantes attached no more importance to them than does to learning a truly learned man in whose company one is less alarmed than in that of a dunce; other doors opened through which there entered the steaming soup, as though the dinner were being held in a puppet-theatre of skilful mechanism where the belated arrival of the young guest set, on a signal from the puppet-master, all the machinery in motion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Timid and not majestically sovereign had been this signal from the Duke, to which had responded the unlocking of that vast, ingenious, subservient and sumptuous clockwork, mechanical and human. The indecision of his gesture did not spoil for me the effect of the spectacle that was attendant upon it. For I could feel that what had made it hesitating and embarrassed was the fear of letting me see that they were waiting only for myself to begin dinner and that they had been waiting for some time, just as Mme. de Guermantes was afraid that after looking at so many pictures I would find it tiring and would be hindered from taking my ease among them if her husband engaged me in a continuous flow of introductions. So that it was the absence of grandeur in this gesture that disclosed its true grandeur. As, also, did that indifference shewn by the Duke to the splendour of his surroundings, in contrast to his deference towards a guest, however insignificant, whom he desired to honour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not that M. de Guermantes was not in certain respects thoroughly commonplace, shewing indeed some of the absurd weaknesses of a man with too much money, the arrogance of an upstart, which he certainly was not. But just as a public official or a priest sees his own humble talents multiplied to infinity (as a wave is by the whole mass of the sea which presses behind it) by those forces on which they can rely, the Government of France and the Catholic Church, so M. de Guermantes was borne on by that other force, aristocratic courtesy in its truest form. This courtesy drew the line at any number of people. Mme. de Guermantes would not have asked to her house Mme. de Cambremer, or M. de Forcheville. But the moment that anyone (as was the case with me) appeared eligible for admission into the Guermantes world, this courtesy revealed treasures of hospitable simplicity more splendid still, were that possible, than those historic rooms, or the marvellous furniture that had remained in them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he wished to give pleasure to anyone, M. de Guermantes possessed, in this way, for making his guest for the moment the principal person present, an art which made the most of the circumstances and the place. No doubt at Guermantes his \u2018distinctions\u2019 and \u2018favours\u2019 would have assumed another form. He would have ordered his carriage to take me for a drive, alone with himself, before dinner. Such as they were, one could not help feeling touched by his manners as one is in reading memoirs of the period by those of Louis XIV when he replies good-naturedly, smiling and almost with a bow, to some one who has come to solicit his favour. It must however in both instances be borne in mind that this \u2018politeness\u2019 did not go beyond the strict meaning of the word\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Louis XIV (with whom the sticklers for pure nobility of his day find fault, nevertheless, for his scant regard for etiquette, so much so that, according to Saint-Simon, he was only a very minor king, as kings go, when compared with such monarchs as Philippe de Valois or Charles V), has the most minute instructions drawn up so that Princes of the Blood and Ambassadors may know to what sovereigns they ought to give precedence. In certain cases, in view of the impossibility of arriving at a decision a compromise is arranged by which the son of Louis XIV, Monseigneur, shall entertain certain foreign sovereigns only out of doors, in the open air, so that it may not be said that in entering the house one has preceded the other; and the Elector Palatine, entertaining the Duc de Chevreuse at dinner, pretends, so as not to have to make way for his guest, to be taken ill, and dines with him indeed, but dines lying down, thus avoiding the difficulty. M. le Duc evading opportunities of paying his duty to Monsieur the latter, on the advice of the King, his brother, who is moreover extremely attached to him, seizes an excuse for making his cousin attend his levee and forcing him to pass him his shirt. But as soon as the feeling is deep, when the heart is involved, this rule of duty, so inflexible when politeness only is at stake, changes entirely. A few hours after the death of his brother, one of the people whom he most dearly loved, when Monsieur, in the words of the Duc de Montfort, is \u2018still warm,\u2019 we find Louis XIV singing snatches from operas, astonished that the Duchesse de Bourgogne, who has difficulty in concealing her grief, should be looking so woe-begone, and, desiring that the gaiety of the court shall be at once resumed, so that his courtiers may be encouraged to sit down to the tables, ordering the Duc de Bourgogne to start a game of brelan. Well, not only in his social and concentrated activities, but in the most spontaneous utterances, the ordinary preoccupations of M. de Guermantes, the use he made of his time, one found a similar contrast; the Guermantes were no more susceptible than other mortals to grief; one might indeed say that their actual sensibility was lower; on the other hand one saw their names every day in the social columns of the Gaulois on account of the prodigious number of funerals at which they would have felt it a neglect of duty not to have their presence recorded. As the traveller discovers, almost unaltered, the houses roofed with turf, the terraces which may have met the eyes of Xenophon or Saint Paul, so in the manners of M. de Guermantes, a man who melted one\u2019s heart by his courtesy and revolted it by his harshness, I found still intact after the lapse of more than two centuries that deviation typical of court life under Louis XIV which transfers all scruples of conscience from matters of the affections and morality and applies them to purely formal questions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other reason for the friendliness shewn me by the Princesse de Parme was of a more personal kind. It was that she was convinced beforehand that everything that she saw at the Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019s, people and things alike, was of a quality superior to that of anything that she had at home. It is true that in all the other houses of her acquaintance she behaved as if this had been the case; over the simplest dish, the most ordinary flowers, she was not satisfied with going into ecstasies, she would ask leave to send round next morning, to copy the recipe or to examine the variety of blossom, her head cook or head gardener, gentlemen with large salaries who kept their own carriages and were deeply humiliated at having to come to inquire after a dish they despised or to take notes of a kind of carnation that was not half so fine, had not such ornamental streaks, did not produce so large a blossom as those which they had long been growing for her at home. But if in the Princess, wherever she went, this astonishment at the sight of the most commonplace things was assumed, and intended to shew that she did not derive from the superiority of her rank and riches a pride forbidden by her early instructors, habitually dissembled by her mother and intolerable in the sight of her Creator, it was, on the other hand, in all sincerity that she regarded the drawing-room of the Duchesse de Guermantes as a privileged place in which she could pass only from surprise to delight. To a certain extent, for that matter, though not nearly enough to justify this state of mind, the Guermantes were different from the rest of noble society, they were rarer and more refined. They had given me at first sight the opposite impression; I had found them vulgar, similar to all other men and women, but because before meeting them I had seen in them, as in Balbec, in Florence, in Parma, only names. Evidently, in this drawing-room, all the women whom I had imagined as being like porcelain figures were even more like the great majority of women. But, in the same way as Balbec or Florence, the Guermantes, after first disappointing the imagination because they resembled their fellow-creatures rather than their name, could subsequently, though to a less degree, appeal to the intellect by certain distinctive characteristics. Their bodily structure, the colour \u2014 a peculiar pink that merged at times into violet \u2014 of their skins, a certain almost flashing fairness of the finely spun hair, even in the men, on whom it was massed in soft golden tufts, half a wall-growing lichen, half a catlike fur (a luminous sparkle to which corresponded a certain brilliance of intellect, for if people spoke of the Guermantes complexion, the Guermantes hair, they spoke also of the wit of the Guermantes, as of the wit of the Mortemarts \u2014 a certain social quality whose superior fineness was famed even before the days of Louis XIV and all the more universally recognised since they published the fame of it themselves), all this meant that in the material itself, precious as that might be, in which one found them embedded here and there, the Guermantes remained recognisable, easy to detect and to follow, like the veins whose paleness streaks a block of jasper or onyx, or, better still, like the pliant waving of those tresses of light whose loosened hairs run like flexible rays along the sides of a moss-agate\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guermantes \u2014 those at least who were worthy of the name \u2014 were not only of a quality of flesh, of hair, of transparency of gaze that was exquisite, but had a way of holding themselves, of walking, of bowing, of looking at one before they shook one\u2019s hand, of shaking hands, which made them as different in all these respects from an ordinary person in society as he in turn was from a peasant in a smock. And despite their friendliness one asked oneself: \u201cHave they not indeed the right, though they waive it, when they see us walk, bow, leave a room, do any of those things which when performed by them become as graceful as the flight of a swallow or the bending of a rose on its stem, to think: \u2018These people are of another race than ours, and we are, we, the true lords of creation.\u2019?\u201d Later on, I realised that the Guermantes did indeed regard me as being of another race, but one that aroused their envy because I possessed merits of which I knew nothing and which they professed to regard as alone important. Later still I came to feel that this profession of faith was only half sincere and that in them scorn or surprise could be coexistent with admiration and envy The physical flexibility essential to the Guermantes was twofold; thanks to one of its forms, constantly in action, at any moment and if, for example, a male Guermantes were about to salute a lady, he produced a silhouette of himself made from the unstable equilibrium of a series of asymmetrical movements with nervous compensations, one leg dragging a little either on purpose or because, having been broken so often in the hunting-field, it imparted to his trunk in its effort to keep pace with the other a deviation to which the upward thrust of one shoulder gave a counterpoise, while the monocle settled itself before his eye, raising an eyebrow just as the tuft of hair on the forehead was lowered in the formal bow; the other flexibility, like the form of the wave, the wind or the ocean track which is preserved on the shell or the vessel, was so to speak stereotyped in a sort of fixed mobility, curving the arched nose which, beneath the blue, protruding eyes, above the over-thin lips, from which, in the women, there emerged a raucous voice, recalled the fabulous origin attributed in the sixteenth century by the complaisance of parasitic and Hellenising genealogists to his race, ancient beyond dispute, but not to the degree of antiquity which they claimed when they gave as its source the mythological impregnation of a nymph by a divine Bird\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guermantes were just as idiomatic from the intellectual as from the physical point of view. With the exception of Prince Gilbert (the husband with antiquated ideas of \u2018Marie-Gilbert,\u2019 who made his wife sit on his left when they drove out together because her blood, though royal, was inferior to his own)\u2014 but he was an exception and furnished, behind his back, a perpetual laughing-stock to the rest of the family, who had always fresh anecdotes to tell of him \u2014 the Guermantes, while living in the pure cream of aristocracy, affected to take no account of nobility. The theories of the Duchesse de Guermantes, who, to tell the truth, by dint of being a Guermantes, became to a certain extent something different and more attractive, subordinated everything else so completely to intellect, and were in politics so socialistic that one asked oneself where in her mansion could be hiding the familiar spirit whose duty it was to ensure the maintenance of the aristocratic standard of living, and which, always invisible but evidently crouching at one moment in the entrance hall, at another in the drawing-room, at a third in her dressing-room, reminded the servants of this woman who did not believe in titles to address her as Mme. la Duchesse, reminding also herself who cared only for reading and had no respect for persons to go out to dinner with her sister-in-law when eight o\u2019clock struck, and to put on a low gown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same familiar spirit represented to Mme. de Guermantes the social duties of duchesses, of the foremost among them, that was, who like herself were multi-millionaires, the sacrifice to boring tea, dinner and evening parties of hours in which she might have read interesting books, as unpleasant necessities like rain, which Mme. de Guermantes accepted, letting play on them her biting humour, but without seeking in any way to justify her acceptance of them. The curious accident by which the butler of Mme. de Guermantes invariably said \u201cMadame la Duchesse\u201d to this woman who believed only in the intellect did not however appear to shock her. Never had it entered her head to request him to address her simply as \u2018Madame.\u2019 Giving her the utmost benefit of the doubt one might have supposed that, thinking of something else at the time, she had heard only the word \u2018Madame\u2019 and that the suffix appended to it had not caught her attention. Only, though she might feign deafness, she was not dumb. In fact, whenever she had a message to give to her husband she would say to the butler: \u201cRemind Monsieur le Duc \u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The familiar spirit had other occupations as well, one of which was to inspire them to talk morality. It is true that there were Guermantes who went in for intellect and Guermantes who went in for morals, and that these two classes did not as a rule coincide. But the former kind \u2014 including a Guermantes who had forged cheques, who cheated at cards and was the most delightful of them all, with a mind open to every new and sound idea \u2014 spoke even more eloquently upon morals than the others, and in the same strain as Mme. de Villeparisis, at the moments in which the familiar spirit expressed itself through the lips of the old lady. At corresponding moments one saw the Guermantes adopt suddenly a tone almost as old-ladylike, as genial and (as they themselves had more charm) more touching than that of the Marquise, to say of a servant: \u201cOne feels that she has a thoroughly sound nature, she\u2019s not at all a common girl, she must come of decent parents, she is certainly a girl who has never gone astray.\u201d At such moments the familiar spirit took the form of an intonation. But at times it could be bearing also, the expression on a face, the same in the Duchess as in her grandfather the Marshal, a sort of undefinable convulsion (like that of the Serpent, the genius of the Carthaginian family of Barca) by which my heart had more than once been set throbbing, on my morning walks, when before I had recognised Mme. de Guermantes I felt her eyes fastened upon me from the inside of a little dairy. This familiar spirit had intervened in a situation which was far from immaterial not merely to the Guermantes but to the Courvoisiers, the rival faction of the family and, though of as good blood as the Guermantes (it was, indeed, through his Courvoisier grandmother that the Guermantes explained the obsession which led the Prince de Guermantes always to speak of birth and titles as though those were the only things that mattered), their opposite in every respect. Not only did the Courvoisiers not assign to intelligence the same importance as the Guermantes, they had not the same idea of it. For a Guermantes (even were he a fool) to be intelligent meant to have a sharp tongue, to be capable of saying cutting things, to \u2018get away with it\u2019; but it meant also the capacity to hold one\u2019s own equally in painting, music, architecture, to speak English. The Courvoisiers had formed a less favourable impression of intelligence, and unless one were actually of their world being intelligent was almost tantamount to \u2018having probably murdered one\u2019s father and mother.\u2019 For them intelligence was the sort of burglar\u2019s jemmy by means of which people one did not know from Adam forced the doors of the most reputable drawing-rooms, and it was common knowledge among the Courvoisiers that you always had to pay in the long run for having \u2018those sort\u2019 of people in your house. To the most trivial statements made by intelligent people who were not \u2018in society\u2019 the Courvoisiers opposed a systematic distrust. Some one having on one occasion remarked: \u201cBut Swann is younger than Palam\u00e8de,\u201d\u2014\u201cHe says so, at any rate, and if he says it you may be sure it\u2019s because he thinks it is to his interest!\u201d had been Mme. de Gallardon\u2019s retort. Better still, when some one said of two highly distinguished foreigners whom the Guermantes had entertained that one of them had been sent in first because she was the elder: \u201cBut is she really the elder?\u201d Mme. de Gallardon had inquired, not positively as though that sort of person did not have any age but as if presumably devoid of civil or religious status, of definite traditions, they were both more or less young, like two kittens of the same litter between which only a veterinary surgeon was competent to decide. The Courvoisiers, more than the Guermantes, maintained also in a certain sense the integrity of the titled class thanks at once to the narrowness of their minds and the bitterness of their hearts. Just as the Guermantes (for whom, below the royal families and a few others like the Lignes, the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles and so forth, all the rest were lost in a common rubbish-heap) were insolent towards various people of long descent who lived round Guermantes, simply because they paid no attention to those secondary distinctions by which the Courvoisiers were enormously impressed, so the absence of such distinctions affected them little. Certain women who did not hold any specially exalted rank in their native provinces but, brilliantly married, rich, good-looking, beloved of Duchesses, were for Paris, where people are never very well up in who one\u2019s \u2018father and mother\u2019 were, an excellent and exclusive piece of \u2018imported goods.\u2019 It might happen, though not commonly, that such women were, through the channel of the Princesse de Parme or by virtue of their own attractions, received by certain Guermantes. But with regard to these the indignation of the Courvoisiers knew no bounds. Having to meet, between five and six in the afternoon, at their cousin\u2019s, people with whose relatives their own relatives did not care to be seen mixing down in the Perche became for them an ever-increasing source of rage and an inexhaustible fount of rhetoric. The moment, for instance, when the charming Comtesse G\u2014\u2014-entered the Guermantes drawing-room, the face of Mme. de Villebon assumed exactly the expression that would have befitted it had she been called to recite the line:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And should but one stand fast, that one were surely I\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a line which for that matter was unknown to her. This Courvoisier had consumed almost every Monday an \u00e9clair stuffed with cream within a few feet of the Comtesse G\u2014 \u2014 but to no consequence. And Mme. de Villebon confessed in secret that she could not conceive how her cousin Guermantes could allow a woman into her house who was not even in the second-best society of Ch\u00e2teaudun. \u201cI really fail to see why my cousin should make such a fuss about whom she knows; it\u2019s making a perfect farce of society!\u201d concluded Mme. de Villebon with a change of facial expression, this time a sly smile of despair, which, in a charade, would have been interpreted rather as indicating another line of poetry, though one with which she was no more familiar than with the first:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gr\u00e2ce aux Dieux mon malheur passe mon esp\u00e9rance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We may here anticipate events to explain that the pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance, (which rhymes, in the following line with esp\u00e9rance) shewn by Mme. de Villebon in snubbing Mme. G\u2014\u2014-was not entirely wasted. In the eyes of Mme. G\u2014\u2014\u2014 it invested Mme. de Villebon with a distinction so supreme, though purely imaginary, that when the time came for Mme. G\u2014\u2014-\u2018s daughter, who was the prettiest girl and the greatest heiress in the ballrooms of that season, to marry, people were astonished to see her refuse all the Dukes in succession. The fact was that her mother, remembering the weekly humiliations she had had to endure in the Rue de Grenelle on account of Chateaudun could think of only one possible husband for her daughter \u2014 a Villebon son\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A single point at which Guermantes and Courvoisiers converged was the art (one, for that matter, of infinite variety) of marking distances. The Guermantes manners were not absolutely uniform towards everyone. And yet, to take an example, all the Guermantes, all those who really were Guermantes, when you were introduced to them proceeded to perform a sort of ceremony almost as though the fact that they held out their hands to you had been as important as the conferring of an order of knighthood. At the moment when a Guermantes, were he no more than twenty, but treading already in the footsteps of his ancestors, heard your name uttered by the person who introduced you, he let fall on you as though he had by no means made up his mind to say \u201cHow d\u2019ye do?\u201d a gaze generally blue, always of the coldness of a steel blade which he seemed ready to plunge into the deepest recesses of your heart. Which was a matter of fact what the Guermantes imagined themselves to be doing, each of them regarding himself as a psychologist of the highest order. They thought moreover that they increased by this inspection the affability of the salute which was to follow it, and would not be rendered you without full knowledge of your deserts. All this occurred at a distance from yourself which, little enough had it been a question of a passage of arms, seemed immense for a handclasp, and had as chilling an effect in this connexion as in the other, so that when the Guermantes, after a rapid twisting thrust that explored the most intimate secrets of your soul and laid bare your title to honour, had deemed you worthy to associate with him thereafter, his hand, directed towards you at the end of an arm stretched out to its fullest extent, appeared to be presenting a rapier at you for a single combat, and that hand was in fact placed so far in advance of the Guermantes himself at that moment that when he afterwards bowed his head it was difficult to distinguish whether it was yourself or his own hand that he was saluting. Certain Guermantes, lacking the sense of proportion, or being incapable of refraining from repeating themselves incessantly, went further and repeated this ceremony afresh every time that they met you. Seeing that they had no longer any need to conduct the preliminary psychological investigation for which the \u2018familiar spirit\u2019 had delegated its powers to them and the result of which they had presumably kept in mind, the insistence of the perforating gaze preceding the handclasp could be explained only by the automatism which their gaze had acquired or by some power of fascination which they believed themselves to possess. The Courvoisiers whose physique was different, had tried in vain to assimilate that searching gaze and had had to fall back upon a lordly stiffness or a rapid indifference On the other hand, it was from the Courvoisiers that certain very exceptional Guermantes of the gentler sex seemed to have borrowed the feminine form of greeting. At the moment when you were presented to one of these she made you a sweeping bow in which she carried towards you, almost to an angle of forty-five degrees, her head and bust, the rest of her body (which came very high, up to the belt which formed a pivot) remaining stationary. But no sooner had she projected thus towards you the upper part of her person than she flung it backwards beyond the vertical line by a sudden retirement through almost the same angle. This subsequent withdrawal neutralised what appeared to have been conceded to you; the ground which you believed yourself to have gained did not even remain a conquest, as in a duel; the original positions were retained. This same annulment of affability by the resumption of distance (which was Courvoisier in origin and intended to shew that the advances made in the first movement were no more than a momentary feint) displayed itself equally clearly, in the Courvoisier ladies as in the Guermantes, in the letters which you received from them, at any rate in the first period of your acquaintance. The \u2018body\u2019 of the letter might contain sentences such as one writes only (you would suppose) to a friend, but in vain might you have thought yourself entitled to boast of being in that relation to the lady, since the letter began with \u2018Monsieur,\u2019 and ended with \u2018Croyez monsieur \u00e0 mes sentiments distingu\u00e9s.\u2019 After which, between this cold opening and frigid conclusion which altered the meaning of all the rest, there might come in succession (were it a reply to a letter of condolence from yourself) the most touching pictures of the grief which the Guermantes lady had felt on losing her sister, of the intimacy that had existed between them, of the beauty of the place in which she was staying, of the consolation that she found in the charm of her young children, all this amounted to no more than a letter such as one finds in printed collections, the intimate character of which implied, however, no more intimacy between yourself and the writer than if she had been the Younger Pliny or Mme. de Simiane\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that certain Guermantes ladies wrote to you from the first as \u2018My dear friend,\u2019 or \u2018My friends\u2019; these were not always the most simple natured among them, but rather those who, living only in the society of kings and being at the same time \u2018light,\u2019 assumed in their pride the certainty that everything which came from themselves gave pleasure and in their corruption the habit of setting no price upon any of the satisfactions that they had to offer. However, since to have had a common ancestor in the reign of Louis XIII was enough to make a young Guermantes say, in speaking of the Marquise de Guermantes: \u201cMy aunt Adam,\u201d the Guermantes were so numerous a clan that, even among these simple rites, that for example of the bow upon introduction to a stranger, there existed a wide divergence. Each subsection of any refinement had its own, which was handed down from parents to children like the prescription for a liniment or a special way of making jam. Thus it was that we saw Saint-Loup\u2019s handclasp thrust out as though involuntarily at the moment of his hearing one\u2019s name, without any participation by his eyes, without the addition of a bow. Any unfortunate commoner who for a particular reason \u2014 which, for that matter, very rarely occurred \u2014 was presented to anyone of the Saint-Loup subsection racked his brains over this abrupt minimum of a greeting, which deliberately assumed the appearance of non-recognition, to discover what in the world the Guermantes \u2014 male or female \u2014 could have against him. And he was highly surprised to learn that the said Guermantes had thought fit to write specially to the introducer to tell him how delighted he or she had been with the stranger, \u2022 whom he or she looked forward to meeting again. As specialised as the mechanical gestures of Saint-Loup were the complicated and rapid capers (which M. de Charlus condemned as ridiculous) of the Marquis de Fierbois, the grave and measured paces of the Prince de Guermantes. But it is impossible to describe here the richness of the choreography of the Guermantes ballet owing to the sheer length of the cast\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to the antipathy which animated the Courvoisiers against the Duchesse de Guermantes, they might have had the consolation of feeling sorry for her so long as she was still unmarried, for she was then comparatively poor. Unfortunately, at all times and seasons, a sort of fuliginous emanation, quite sut generis, enveloped, hid from the eye the wealth of the Courvoisiers which, however great it might be, remained obscure. In vain might a young Courvoisier with an ample dowry find a most eligible bridegroom; it invariably happened that the young couple had no house of their own in Paris, \u2018came up to stay\u2019 in the season with his parents, and for the rest of the year lived down in the country in the thick of a society that may have been unadulterated but was also quite undistinguished. Whereas a Saint-Loup who was up to the eyes in debt dazzled Donci\u00e8res with his carriage-horses, a Courvoisier who was extremely rich always went in the tram. Similarly (though of course many years earlier) Mlle, de Guermantes (Oriane), who had scarcely a penny to her name, created more stir with her clothes than all the Courvoisiers put together. The really scandalous things she said gave a sort of advertisement to her style of dressing and doing her hair. She had had the audacity to say to the Russian Grand Duke: \u201cWell, Sir, I hear you would like to have Tolstoy murdered?\u201d at a dinner-party to which none of the Courvoisiers, not that any of them knew very much about Tolstoy, had been asked. They knew little more about Greek writers, if we may judge by the Dowager Duchesse de Gallardon (mother-in-law of the Princesse de Gallardon who at that time was still a girl) who, not having been honoured by Oriane with a single visit in five years, replied to some one who asked her the reason for this abstention: \u201cIt seems she recites Aristotle\u201d (meaning Aristophanes) \u201cin society. I cannot allow that sort of thing in my house!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One can imagine how greatly this \u2018sally\u2019 by Mlle. de Guermantes upon Tolstoy, if it enraged the Courvoisiers, delighted the Guermantes, and by derivation everyone who was not merely closely but even remotely attached to them. The Dowager Comtesse d\u2019Argencourt (n\u00e9e Seineport) who entertained a little of everything, because she was a blue-stocking and in spite of her son\u2019s being a terrible snob, repeated the saying before her literary friends with the comment: \u201cOriane de Guermantes, you know; she\u2019s as fine as amber, as mischievous as a monkey, there\u2019s nothing she couldn\u2019t do if she chose, her water-colours are worthy of a great painter and she writes better verses than most of the great poets, and as for family, don\u2019t you know, you couldn\u2019t imagine anything better, her grandmother was Mlle, de Montpensier, and she is the eighteenth Oriane de Guermantes in succession, without a single misalliance; it\u2019s the purest blood, the oldest in the whole of France.\u201d And so the sham men of letters, those demi-intellectuals who went to Mme. d\u2019Argencourt\u2019s, forming a mental picture of Oriane de Guermantes, whom they would never have an opportunity to know personally, as something more wonderful and more extraordinary than Princess Badroulbadour, not only felt themselves ready to die for her on learning that so noble a person glorified Tolstoy above all others, but felt also quickening with a fresh strength in their minds their own love of Tolstoy, their longing to fight against Tsarism. These liberal ideas might have grown faint in them, they might have begun to doubt their importance, no longer venturing to confess to holding them, when suddenly from Mlle, de Guermantes herself, that is to say from a girl so indisputably cultured and authorised to speak, who wore her hair flat on her brow (a thing that no Courvoisier would ever have consented to do), came this vehement support. A certain number of realities, good or bad in themselves, gain enormously in this way by receiving the adhesion of people who are in authority over us. For instance among the Courvoisiers the rites of affability in a public thoroughfare consisted in a certain bow, very ugly and far from affable in itself but which people knew to be the distinguished way of bidding a person good day, with the result that everyone else, suppressing the instinctive smile of welcome on his own face, endeavoured to imitate these frigid gymnastics. But the Guermantes in general and Oriane in particular, while better conversant than anyone with these rites, did not hesitate, if they caught sight of you from a carriage, to greet you with a sprightly wave of the hand, and in a drawing-room, leaving the Courvoisiers to make their stiff and imitative bows, sketched charming reverences in the air, held out their hands as though to a comrade with a smile from their blue eyes, so that suddenly, thanks to the Guermantes, there entered into the substance of smartness, until then a little hollow and dry, everything that you would naturally have liked and had compelled yourself to forego, a genuine welcome, the effusion of a true friendliness, spontaneity. It is in a similar fashion (but by a rehabilitation which this time is scarcely justified) that people who carry in themselves an instinctive taste for bad music and for melodies, however commonplace, which have in them something easy and caressing, succeed, by dint of education in symphonic culture, in mortifying that appetite. But once they have arrived at this point, when, dazzled \u2014 and rightly so \u2014 by the brilliant orchestral colouring of Richard Strauss, they see that musician adopt with an indulgence worthy of Auber the most vulgar motifs, what those people originally admired finds suddenly in so high an authority a justification which delights them, and they let themselves be enchanted without scruple and with a twofold gratitude, when they listen to Salom\u00e9, by what it would have been impossible for them to admire in Les Diamants de la Couronne. Authentic or not, the retort made by Mlle, de Guermantes to the Grand Duke, retailed from house to house, furnished an opportunity to relate the excessive smartness with which Oriane had been turned out at the dinner-party in question. But if such splendour (and this is precisely what rendered it unattainable by the Courvoisiers) springs not from wealth but from prodigality, the latter does nevertheless last longer if it enjoys the constant support of the former, which allows it to spend all its fire. Given the principles openly advertised not. only by Oriane but by Mlle, de Villeparisis, namely that nobility does not count, that it is ridiculous to bother one\u2019s head about rank, that wealth does not necessarily mean happiness, that intellect, heart, talent are alone of importance, the Courvoisiers were justified in hoping that, as a result of the training she had received from the Marquise, Oriane would marry some one who was not in society, an artist, a fugitive from justice, a scallawag, a free-thinker, that she would pass definitely into the category of what the Courvoisiers called \u2018detrimentals.\u2019 They were all the more justified in this hope since, inasmuch as Mme. de Villeparisis was at this very moment, from the social point of view, passing through an awkward crisis (none of the few bright stars whom I was to meet in her drawing-room had as yet reappeared there), she professed an intense horror of the society which was thus holding her aloof. Even when she referred to her nephew the Prince de Guermantes, whom she did still see, she could never make an end of mocking at him because he was so infatuated about his pedigree. But the moment it became a question of finding a husband for Oriane, it had been no longer the principles publicly advertised by aunt and niece that had controlled the operations, it had been the mysterious \u2018familiar spirit\u2019 of their race. As unerringly as if Mme. de Villeparisis and Oriane had never spoken of anything but rent-rolls and pedigrees in place of literary merit and depth of character, and as if the Marquise, for the space of a few days, had been \u2014 as she would ultimately be \u2014 dead and on her bier, in the church of Combray, where each member of the family would be reduced to a mere Guermantes, with a forfeiture of individuality and baptismal names to which there testified on the voluminous black drapery of the pall the single \u2018G\u2019 in purple surmounted by the ducal coronet, it was on the wealthiest man and the most nobly born, on the most eligible bachelor of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, on the eldest son of the Duc de Guermantes, the Prince des Laumes, that the familiar spirit had let fall the choice of the intellectual, the critical, the evangelical Mme. de Villeparisis. And for a couple of hours, on the day of the wedding, Mme. de Villeparisis received in her drawing-room all the noble persons at whom she had been in the habit of sneering, at whom she indeed sneered still to the various plebeian intimates whom she had invited and on whom the Prince des Laumes promptly left cards, preparatory to \u2018cutting the cable\u2019 in the following year. And then, making the Courvoisiers\u2019 cup of bit terness overflow, the same old maxims, which made out intellect and talent to be the sole claims to social pre-eminence, resumed their doctrinal fore in the household of the Princesse des Laumes immediately after her mar riage. And in this respect, be it said in passing, the point of view which Saint-Loup upheld when he lived with Rachel, frequented the friends of Rachel, would have liked to marry Rachel, implied \u2014 whatever the horror that it inspired in the family \u2014 less falsehood than that of the Guermantes young ladies in general, preaching the virtues of intellect, barely admitting the possibility of anyone\u2019s questioning the equality of mankind, all of which ended at a given point in the same result as if they had professed the opposite principles, that is to say in marriage to an extremely wealthy duke. Saint-Loup did, on the contrary, act in conformity with his theories which led people to say that he was treading in evil ways. Certainly from the moral standpoint Rachel was not altogether satisfactory. But it is by no means certain whether, if she had been some person no more worthy but a duchess or the heiress to many millions, Mme. de Marsantes would not have been in favour of the match\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well, to return to Mme. des Laumes (shortly afterwards Duchesse de Guermantes, on the death of her father-in-law), it was the last agonising straw upon the backs of the Courvoisiers that the theories of the young Princess, remaining thus lodged in her speech, should not in any sense be guiding her conduct; with the result that this philosophy (if one may so call it) in no way impaired the aristocratic smartness of the Guermantes drawing-room. No doubt all the people whom Mme. de Guermantes did not invite imagined that it was because they were not clever enough, and some rich American lady who had never had any book in her possession except a little old copy, never opened, of Parny\u2019s poems, arranged because it was of the \u2018period\u2019 upon one of the tables in her inner room, shewed how much importance she attached to the things of the mind by the devouring gaze which she fastened on the Duchesse de Guermantes when that lady made her appearance at the Opera. No doubt, also, Mme. de Guermantes was sincere when she selected a person on account of his or her intellect. When she said of a woman: \u201cIt appears, she\u2019s quite charming!\u201d or of a man that he was the \u201ccleverest person in the world,\u201d she imagined herself to have no other reason for consenting to receive them than this charm or cleverness, the familiar spirit not interposing itself at this last moment; more deeply rooted, stationed at the obscure entry of the region in which the Guermantes exercised their judgment, this vigilant spirit precluded them from finding the man clever or the woman charming if they had no social value, actual or potential. The man was pronounced learned, but like a dictionary, or, on the contrary, common, with the mind of a commercial traveller, the woman pretty, but with a terribly bad style, or too talkative. As for the people who had no definite position, they were simply dreadful \u2014 such snobs! M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, whose country house was quite close to Guermantes, mixed with no one below the rank of Highness. But he laughed at them in his heart and longed only to spend his days in museums. Accordingly Mme. de Guermantes was indignant when anyone spoke of M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 as a snob. \u201cA snob! Babal! But, my poor friend, you must be mad, it\u2019s just the opposite. He loathes smart people; he won\u2019t let himself be introduced to anyone. Even in my house! If I ask him to meet some one he doesn\u2019t know, he swears at me all the time.\u201d This was not to say that, even in practice, the Guermantes did not adopt an entirely different attitude towards cleverness from the Courvoisiers. In a positive sense, this difference between the Guermantes and the Courvoisiers had begun already to bear very promising fruit. Thus the Duchesse de Guermantes, enveloped moreover in a mystery which had set so many poets dreaming of her at a respectful distance, had given that party to which I have already referred, at which the King of England had enjoyed himself more thoroughly than anywhere else, for she had had the idea, which would never have occurred to a Courvoisier mind, of inviting, and the audacity, from which a Courvoisier courage would have recoiled, to invite, apart from the personages already mentioned, the musician Gaston Lemaire and the dramatist Grandmougin. But it was pre-eminently from the negative point of view that intellectuality made itself felt. If the necessary coefficient of cleverness and charm declined steadily as the rank of the person who sought an invitation from the Princesse des Laumes became more exalted, vanishing into zero when he or she was one of the principal Crowned Heads of Europe, conversely the farther they fell below this royal level the higher the coefficient rose. For instance at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s parties there were a number of people whom her Royal Highness invited because she had known them as children, or because they were related to some duchess, or attached to the person of some Sovereign, they themselves being quite possibly ugly, boring or stupid; well, with a Courvoisier any of the reasons: \u201ca favourite of the Princesse de Parme,\u201d \u201ca niece on the mother\u2019s side of the Duchesse d\u2019Arpajon,\u201d \u201cspends three months every year with the Queen of Spain,\u201d would have been sufficient to make her invite such people to her house, but Mme. de Guermantes, who had politely acknowledged their bows for ten years at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s, had never once allowed them to cross her threshold, considering that the same rule applied to a drawing-room in a social as in a material sense, where it only needed a few pieces of furniture which had no particular beauty but were left there to fill the room and as a sign of the owner\u2019s wealth, to render it hideous. Such a drawing-room resembled a book in which the author could not refrain from the use of language advertising his own learning, brilliance, fluency. Like a book, like a house, the quality of a \u2018salon,\u2019 thought Mme. de Guermantes \u2014 and rightly \u2014 is based on the corner-stone of sacrifice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many of the friends of the Princesse de Parme, with whom the Duchesse de Guermantes had confined herself for years past to the same conventional greeting, or to returning their cards, without ever inviting them to her parties or going to theirs, complained discreetly of these omissions to her Highness who, on days when M. de Guermantes came by himself to see her, passed on a hint to him. But the wily nobleman, a bad husband to the Duchess in so far as he kept mistresses, but her most tried and trusty friend in everything that concerned the good order of her drawing-room (and her own wit, which formed its chief attraction), replied: \u201cBut doe my wife know her? Indeed! Oh, well, I daresay she does. But the truth is, Ma\u2019am, that Oriane does not care for women\u2019s conversation. She lives surrounded by a court of superior minds \u2014 I am not her husband, I am only the first footman. Except for quite a small number, who are all of them very clever indeed, women bore her. Surely, Ma\u2019am, your Highness with all her fine judgment is not going to tell me that the Marquise de Souvr\u00e9 has any brains. Yes, I quite understand, the Princess receives her out of kindness. Besides, your Highness knows her. You tell me that Oriane has met her; it is quite possible, but once or twice at the most I assure you. And then, I must explain to your Highness, it is really a little my fault as well. My wife is very easily tired, and she is so anxious to be friendly always that if I allowed her she would never stop going to see people. Only yesterday evening she had a temperature, she was afraid of hurting the Duchesse de Bourbon\u2019s feelings by not going to see her. I had to shew my teeth, I assure you; I positively forbade them to bring the carriage round. Do you know, Ma\u2019am, I should really prefer not to mention to Oriane that you have spoken to me about Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. My wife is so devoted to your Highness, she will go round at once to invite Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 to the house; that will mean another call to be paid, it will oblige us to make friends with the sister, whose husband I know quite well. I think I shall say nothing at all about it to Oriane, if the Princess has no objection. That will save her a great deal of strain and excitement. And I assure you that it will be no loss to Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. She goes everywhere, moves in the most brilliant circles. You know, we don\u2019t entertain at all, really, just a few little friendly dinners, Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 would be bored to death.\u201d The Princesse de Parme, innocently convinced that the Duc de Guermantes would not transmit her request to his Duchess, and dismayed by her failure to procure the invitation that Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 sought, was all the more flattered to think that she herself was one of the regular frequenters of so exclusive a household. No doubt this satisfaction had its drawbacks also. Thus whenever the Princesse de Parme invited Mme. de Guermantes to her own parties she had to rack her brains to be sure that there was no one else on her list whose presence might offend the Duchess and make her refuse to come again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On ordinary evenings (after dinner, at which she invariably entertained at a very early hour, for she clung to old customs, a small party) the drawing-room of the Princesse de Parme was thrown open to her regular guests, and, generally speaking, to all the higher ranks of the aristocracy, French and foreign. The order of her receptions was as follows: on issuing from the dining-room the Princess sat down on a sofa before a large round table and chatted with the two most important of the ladies who had dined with her, or else cast her eyes over a magazine, or sometimes played cards (or pretended to play, adopting a German court custom), either a game of patience by herself or selecting as her real or pretended partner some prominent personage. By nine o\u2019clock the double doors of the big drawing-room were in a state of perpetual agitation, opening and shutting and opening again to admit the visitors who had dined quietly at home (or if they had dined in town hurried from their caf\u00e9 promising to return later, since they intended only to go in at one door and out at the other) in order to conform with the Princess\u2019s time-table. She, meanwhile, her mind fixed on her game or conversation, made a show of not seeing the new arrivals, and it was not until they were actually within reach of her that she rose graciously from her seat, with a friendly smile for the women. The latter thereupon sank before the upright Presence in a courtesy which was tantamount to a genuflexion, so as to bring their lips down to the level of the beautiful hand which hung very low, and to kiss it. But at that moment the Princess, just as if she had been every time surprised by a formality with which nevertheless she was perfectly familiar, raised the kneeling figure as though by main force, and with incomparable grace and sweetness, and kissed her on both cheeks. A grace and sweetness that were conditional, you may say, upon the meekness with which the arriving guest inclined her knee. Very likely; and it seems that in a society without distinctions of rank politeness would vanish, not, as is generally supposed, from want of breeding, but because from one class would have vanished the deference due to a distinction which must be imaginary to be effective, and, more completely still, from the other class the affability in the distribution of which one is prodigal so long as one knows it to be, to the recipient, of an untold value which, in a world based on equality, would at once fall to nothing like everything that has only a promissory worth. But this disappearance of politeness in a reconstructed society is by no means certain, and we are at times too ready to believe that the present is the only possible state of things. People of first-rate intelligence have held the opinion that a Republic could not have any diplomacy or foreign alliances, and, more recently, that the peasant class would not tolerate the separation of Church and State. After all, the survival of politeness in a society levelled to uniformity would be no more miraculous than the practical success of the railway or the use of the aeroplane in war. Besides, even if politeness were to vanish, there is nothing to shew that this would be a misfortune. Lastly, would not society become secretly more hierarchical as it became outwardly more democratic? This seems highly probable. The political power of the Popes has grown enormously since they ceased to possess either States or an Army; our cathedrals meant far less to a devout Catholic of the seventeenth century than they mean to an atheist of the twentieth, and if the Princesse de Parme had been the sovereign ruler of a State, no doubt I should have felt myself impelled to speak of her almost as I should speak of a President of the Republic, that is to say not at all\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as the postulant had been raised from the ground and embraced by the Princess, the latter resumed her seat and returned to her game of patience, but first of all, if the newcomer were of any importance, held her for a moment in conversation, making her sit down in an armchair\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the room became too crowded the lady in waiting who had to control the traffic cleared the floor by leading the regular guests into an immense hall on to which the drawing-room opened, a hall filled with portraits and minor trophies of the House of Bourbon. The intimate friends of the Princess would then volunteer for the part of guide and would repeat interesting anecdotes, to which the young people had not the patience to listen, more interested in the spectacle of living Royalties (with the possibility of having themselves presented to them by the lady in waiting and the maids of honour) than in examining the relics of dead Sovereigns. Too much occupied with the acquaintances which they would be able to form and the invitations it might perhaps be possible to secure, they knew absolutely nothing, even in after-years, of what there was in this priceless museum of the archives of the Monarchy, and could only recall confusedly that it was decorated with cacti and giant palms which gave this centre of social elegance a look of the palmarium in the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Naturally the Duchesse de Guermantes, by way of self-mortification, did occasionally appear on these evenings to pay an \u2018after dinner\u2019 call on the Princess, who kept her all the time by her side, while she rallied the Duke. But on evenings when the Duchess came to dine, the Princess took care not to invite her regular party, and closed her doors to the world on rising from table, for fear lest a too liberal selection of guests might offend the exacting Duchess. On such evenings, were any of the faithful who had not received warning to present themselves on the royal doorstep, they would be informed by the porter: \u201cHer Royal Highness is not at home this evening,\u201d and would turn away. But, long before this, many of the Princess\u2019s friends had known that, on the day in question, they would not be asked to her house. These were a special set of parties, a privilege barred to so many who must have longed for admission. The excluded could, with a practical certainty, enumerate the roll of the elect, and would say irritably among themselves: \u201cYou know, of course, that Oriane de Guermantes never goes anywhere without her entire staff.\u201d With the help of this body the Princesse de Parme sought to surround the Duchess as with a protecting rampart against those persons the chance of whose making a good impression on her was at all doubtful. But with several of the Duchess\u2019s favourites, with several members of this glittering \u2018staff,\u2019 the Princesse de Parme resented having to go out of her way to shew them attentions, seeing that they paid little or no attention to herself. No doubt the Princess was fully prepared to admit that it was possible to derive more enjoyment in the company of the Duchesse de Guermantes than in her own. She could not deny that there was always a \u2018crush\u2019 on the Duchess\u2019s at-home days, or that she herself often met there three or four royal personages who thought it sufficient to leave their cards upon her. And in vain might she commit to memory Oriane\u2019s witty sayings, copy her gowns, serve at her own tea parties the same strawberry tarts, there were occasions on which she was left by herself all afternoon with a lady in waiting and some foreign Counsellor of Legation. And so whenever (as had been the case with Swann, for instance, at an earlier period) there was anyone who never let a day pass without going to spend an hour or two at the Duchess\u2019s and paid a call once in two years on the Princesse de Parme, the latter felt no great desire, even for the sake of amusing Oriane, to make to this Swann or whoever he was the \u2018advances\u2019 of an invitation to dinner. In a word, having the Duchess in her house was for the Princess a source of endless perplexity, so haunted was she by the fear that Oriane would find fault with everything. But in return, and for the same reason, when the Princesse de Parme came to dine with Mme. de Guermantes she could be certain beforehand that everything would be perfect, delightful, she had only one fear which was that of her own inability to understand, remember, give satisfaction, her inability to assimilate new ideas and people. On this account my presence aroused her attention and excited her cupidity, just as might a new way of decorating the dinner-table with festoons of fruit, uncertain as she was which of the two it might be \u2014 the table decorations or my presence \u2014 that was the more distinctively one of those charms, the secret of the success of Oriane\u2019s parties, and in her uncertainty firmly resolved to try at her own next dinner-party to introduce them both. What for that matter fully justified the enraptured curiosity which the Princesse de Parme brought to the Duchess\u2019s house was that element \u2014 amusing, dangerous, exciting \u2014 into which the Princess used to plunge with a combination of anxiety, shock and delight (as at the seaside on one of those days of \u2018big waves\u2019 of the danger of which the bathing-masters warn us, simply and solely because none of them knows how to swim), from which she used to emerge terrified, happy, rejuvenated, and which was known as the wit of the Guermantes. The wit of the Guermantes \u2014 a thing as non-existent as the squared circle, according to the Duchess who regarded herself as the sole Guermantes to possess it \u2014 was a family reputation like that of the pork pies of Tours or the biscuits of Rheims. No doubt (since an intellectual peculiarity does not employ for its perpetuation the same channels as a shade of hair or complexion) certain intimate friends of the Duchess who were not of her blood were nevertheless endowed with this wit, which on the other hand had failed to permeate the minds of various Guermantes, too refractory to assimilate wit of any kind. The holders, not related to the Duchess, of this Guermantes wit had generally the characteristic feature of having been brilliant men, fitted for a career to which, whether it were in the arts, diplomacy, parliamentary eloquence or the army, they had preferred the life of a small and intimate group. Possibly this preference could be explained by a certain want of originality, of initiative, of will power, of health or of luck, or possibly by snobbishness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With certain people (though these, it must be admitted, were the exception) if the Guermantes drawing-room had been the stumbling-block in their careers, it had been without their knowledge. Thus a doctor, a painter and a diplomat of great promise had failed to achieve success in the careers for which they were nevertheless more brilliantly endowed than most of their competitors because their friendship with the Guermantes had the result that the two former were regarded as men of fashion and the third as a reactionary, which had prevented each of the three from winning the recognition of his colleagues. The mediaeval gown and red cap which are still donned by the electoral colleges of the Faculties are (or were at least, not so long since) something more than a purely outward survival from a narrow-minded past, from a rigid sectarianism. Under the cap with its golden tassels, like the High Priest in the conical mitre of the Jews, the \u2018Professors\u2019 were still, in the years that preceded the Dreyfus case, fast rooted in rigorously pharisaical ideas. Du Boulbon was at heart an artist, but was safe because he did not care for society. Cottard was always at the Verdurins\u2019. But Mme. Verdurin was a patient; besides, he was protected by his vulgarity; finally, at his own house he entertained no one outside the Faculty, at banquets over which there floated an aroma of carbolic. But in powerful corporations, where moreover the rigidity of their prejudices is but the price that must be paid for the noblest integrity, the most lofty conceptions of morality, which weaken in an atmosphere that, more tolerant, freer at first, becomes very soon dissolute, a Professor in his gown of scarlet satin faced with ermine, like that of a Doge (which is to say a Duke) of Venice enshrined in the Ducal Palace, was as virtuous, as deeply attached to noble principles, but as unsparing of any alien element as that other Duke, excellent but terrible, whom we know as M. de Saint-Simon. The alien, here, was the wordly doctor, with other manners, other social relations. To make good, the unfortunate of whom we are now speaking, so as not to be accused by his colleagues of looking down on them (the strange ideas of a man of fashion!) if he concealed from them his Duchesse de Guermantes, hoped to disarm them by giving mixed dinner-parties in which the medical element was merged in the fashionable. He was unaware that in so doing he signed his own death-warrant, or rather he discovered this later, when the Council of Ten had to fill a vacant chair, and it was invariably the name of another doctor, more normal, it might be obviously inferior, that leaped from the fatal urn, when their \u2018Veto\u2019 thundered from the ancient Faculty, as solemn, as absurd and as terrible as the \u2018Juro\u2019 that spelled the death of Moli\u00e8re. So too with the painter permanently labelled man of fashion, when fashionable people who dabbled in art had succeeded in making themselves be labelled artists; so with the diplomat who had too many reactionary associations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this case was the rarest of all. The type of distinguished man who formed the main substance of the Guermantes drawing-room was that of people who had voluntarily (or so at least they supposed) renounced all else, everything that was incompatible with the wit of the Guermantes, with the courtesy of the Guermantes, with that indefinable charm odious to any \u2018Corporation\u2019 however little centralised\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the people who were aware that in days gone by one of these frequenters of the Duchess\u2019s drawing-room had been awarded the gold medal of the Salon, that another, Secretary to the Bar Council, had made a brilliant start in the Chamber, that a third had ably served France as Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires, might have been led to regard as \u2018failures\u2019 people who had done nothing more now for twenty years. But there were few who were thus \u2018well-informed,\u2019 and the parties concerned would themselves have been the last to remind people, finding these old distinctions to be now valueless, in the light of this very Guermantes spirit of wit: for did not this condemn respectively as a bore or an usher, and as a counter-jumper a pair of eminent Ministers, one a trifle solemn, the other addicted to puns, of whose praises the newspapers were always full but in whose company Mme. de Guermantes would begin to yawn and shew signs of impatience if the imprudence of a hostess had placed either of them next to her at the dinner-table. Since being a statesman of the first rank was in no sense a recommendation to the Duchess\u2019s favour, those of her friends who had definitely abandoned the \u2018Career\u2019 or the \u2018Service,\u2019 who had never stood for the Chamber, felt, as they came day after day to have luncheon and talk with their great friend, or when they met her in the houses of Royal Personages, of whom for that matter they thought very little (or at least they said so), that they themselves had chosen the better part, albeit their melancholy air, even in the midst of the gaiety, seemed somehow to challenge the soundness of this opinion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be recognised also that the refinement of social life, the subtlety of conversation at the Guermantes\u2019 did also contain, exiguous as it may have been, an element of reality. No official title was equivalent to the approval of certain chosen friends of Mme. de Guermantes, whom the most powerful Ministers had been unable to attract to their houses. If in this drawing-room so many intellectual ambitions, such noble efforts even had been for ever buried, still at least from their dust the rarest blossoms of civilised society had taken life. Certainly men of wit, Swann for instance, regarded themselves as superior to men of genuine worth, whom they despised, but that was because what the Duchesse de Guermantes valued above everything else was not intellect; it was, according to her, that superior, more exquisite form of the human intellect exalted to a verbal variety of talent \u2014 wit. And long ago at the Verdurins\u2019 when Swann condemned Brichot and Elstir, one as a pedant and the other as a clown, despite all the learning of one and the other\u2019s genius, it was the infiltration of the Guermantes spirit that had led him to classify them so. Never would he have dared to present either of them to the Duchess, conscious instinctively of the air with which she would have listened to Brichot\u2019s monologues and Elstir\u2019s hair-splittings, the Guermantes spirit regarding pretentious and prolix speech, whether in a serious or a farcical vein, as alike of the most intolerable imbecility\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the Guermantes of the true flesh and blood, if the Guermantes spirit had not absorbed them as completely as we see occur in, to take an example, those literary circles in which everyone shares a common way of pronouncing his words, of expressing his thoughts, and consequently of thinking, it was certainly not because originality is stronger in purely social groups or presents any obstacle there to imitation. But imitation depends not merely upon the absence of any unconquerable originality but also demands a relative fineness of ear which enables one first of all to discern what one is afterwards to imitate. Whereas there were several Guermantes in whom this musical sense was as entirely lacking as in the Courvoisiers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To take as an instance what is called, in another sense of the word imitation, \u2018giving imitations\u2019 (or among the Guermantes was called \u2018taking off\u2019), Mme. de Guermantes might succeed in this to perfection, the Courvoisiers were as incapable of appreciating her as if they had been a tribe of rabbits instead of men and women, because they had never had the sense to observe the particular defect or accent that the Duchess was endeavouring to copy. When she \u2018gave an imitation\u2019 of the Duc de Limoges, the Courvoisiers would protest: \u201cOh, no, he doesn\u2019t really speak like that! I met him again only yesterday at dinner at Bebeth\u2019s; he talked to me all evening and he didn\u2019t speak like that at all!\u201d whereas the Guermantes of any degree of culture exclaimed: \u201cGad, what fun Oriane is! The odd part of it is that when she is copying him she looks exactly like him! I feel I\u2019m listening to him. Oriane, do give us a little more Limoges!\u201d Now these Guermantes (and not necessarily the few really outstanding members of the clan who when the Duchess imitated the Duc de Limoges, would say admiringly\u2019 \u201cOh, you really have got him,\u201d or \u201cYou do get him,\u201d) might indeed be del void of wit according to Mme. de Guermantes (and in this respect she was right); yet, by dint of hearing and repeating her sayings they had come to imitate more or less her way of expressing herself, of criticising people of what Swann, like the Duke himself, used to call her \u2018phrasing\u2019 of things so that they presented in their conversation something which to the Courvoisiers appeared \u2018fearfully like\u2019 Oriane\u2019s wit and was treated by them collectively as the \u2018wit of the Guermantes.\u2019 As these Guermantes were to her not merely kinsfolk but admirers, Oriane (who kept the rest of the family rigorously at arm\u2019s-length and now avenged by her disdain the insults that they had heaped upon her in her girlhood) went to call on them now and then, generally in company with the Duke, in the season, when she drove out with him. These visits were historic events. The heart began to beat more rapidly in the bosom of the Princesse d\u2019Epinay, who was \u2018at home\u2019 in her big drawing-room on the ground floor, when she perceived afar off, like the first glow of an innocuous fire, or the \u2018reconnaissances\u2019 of an unexpected invasion, making her way across the courtyard slowly, in a diagonal course, the Duchess crowned with a ravishing hat and holding atilt a sunshade from which there rained down a summer fragrance. \u201cWhy, here comes Oriane,\u201d she would say, like an \u2018On guard!\u2019 intended to convey a prudent warning to her visitors, so that they should have time to beat an orderly retreat, to clear the rooms without panic. Half of those present dared not remain, and rose at once to go. \u201cBut no, why? Sit down again, I insist on keeping you a little longer,\u201d said the Princess in a careless tone and seemingly at her ease (to shew herself the great lady) but in a voice that suddenly rang false. \u201cBut you may want to talk to each other.\u201d \u201cReally, you\u2019re in a hurry? Oh, very well, I shall come and see you,\u201d replied the lady of the house to those whom she was just as well pleased to see depart. The Duke and Duchess gave a very civil greeting to people whom they had seen there regularly for years, without for that reason coming to know them any better, while these in return barely said good day to them, thinking this more discreet. Scarcely had they left the room before the Duke began asking good-naturedly who they were, so as to appear to be taking an interest in the intrinsic quality of people whom he himself, owing to the cross-purposes of fate or the wretched state of Oriane\u2019s nerves, never saw in his own house. \u201cTell me, who was that little woman in the pink hat?\u201d \u201cWhy, my dear cousin, you have seen her hundreds of times, she\u2019s the Vicomtesse de Tours, who was a Lamarzelle.\u201d \u201cBut, do you know, she\u2019s quite good-looking; she seems clever too; if it weren\u2019t for a little flaw in her upper lip she\u2019d be a regular charmer. If there\u2019s a Vicomte de Tours, he can\u2019t have any too bad a time. Oriane, do you know what those eyebrows and the way her hair grows reminded me of? Your cousin Hedwige de Ligne.\u201d The Duchesse de Guermantes, who languished whenever people spoke of the beauty of any woman other than herself, let the conversation drop. She bad reckoned without the weakness her husband had for letting it be seen that he knew all about the people who did not come to his house, whereby be believed that he shewed himself to be more seriously minded than his wife. \u2018\u201cBut,\u201d he resumed suddenly with emphasis, \u201cyou mentioned the name Lamarzelle. I remember, when I was in the Chamber, hearing a really remarkable speech made . . . \u201d \u201cThat was the uncle of the young woman you saw just now.\u201d \u201cIndeed! What talent! No, my dear girl,\u201d he assured the Vicomtesse d\u2019Egremont, whom Mme. de Guermantes could not endure, but who, refusing to stir from the Princesse d\u2019Epinay\u2019s drawing-room where she willingly humbled herself to play the part of parlour-maid (and was ready to slap her own parlour-maid on returning home), stayed there, confused, tearful, but stayed when the ducal couple were in the room, took their cloaks, tried to make herself useful, offered discreetly to withdraw into the next room, \u201cyou are not to make tea for us, let us just sit and talk quietly, we are simple souls, really, honestly. Besides,\u201d he went on, turning to the Princesse d\u2019Epinay (leaving the Egremont lady blushing, humble, ambitious and full of zeal), \u201cwe can only give you a quarter of an hour.\u201d This quarter of an hour was entirely taken up with a sort of exhibition of the witty things which the Duchess had said during the previous week, and to which she herself would certainly not have referred had not her husband, with great adroitness, by appearing to be rebuking her with reference to the incidents that had provoked them, obliged her as though against her will to repeat them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Princesse d\u2019Epinay, who was fond of her cousin and knew that she had a weakness for compliments, went into ecstasies over her hat, her sunshade, her wit. \u201cTalk to her as much as you like about her clothes,\u201d said the Duke in the sullen tone which he had adopted and now tempered with a sardonic smile so that his resentment should not be taken seriously, \u201cbut for heaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t speak of her wit, I should be only too glad not to have so witty a wife. You are probably alluding to the shocking pun she made about my brother Palam\u00e8de,\u201d he went on, knowing quite well that the Princess and the rest of the family had not yet heard this pun, and delighted to have an opportunity of shewing off his wife. \u201cIn the first place I consider it unworthy of a person who has occasionally, I must admit, said some quite good things, to make bad puns, but especially about my brother, who is very susceptible, and if it is going to lead to his quarrelling with me, that would really be too much of a good thing.\u201d \u201cBut we never heard a word about it! One of Oriane\u2019s puns! It\u2019s sure to be delicious. Oh, do tell us!\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d the Duke went on, still sulking though with a broader smile, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you haven\u2019t heard it. Seriously, I\u2019m very fond of my brother.\u201d \u201cListen, Basin,\u201d broke in the Duchess, the moment having come for her to take up her husband\u2019s cue, \u201cI can\u2019t think why you should say that it might annoy Palam\u00e8de, you know quite well it would do nothing of the sort. He is far too intelligent to be vexed by a stupid joke which has nothing offensive about it. You are making them think I said something nasty; I simply uttered a remark which was not in the least funny, it is you who make it seem important by losing your temper over it. I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d \u201cYou are making us terribly excited, what is it all about?\u201d \u201cOh, obviously nothing serious!\u201d cried M. de Guermantes. \u201cYou may have heard that my brother offered to give Br\u00e9z\u00e9, the place he got from his wife, to his sister Marsantes.\u201d \u201cYes, but we were told that she didn\u2019t want it, she didn\u2019t care for that part of the country, the climate didn\u2019t suit her.\u201d \u201cVery well, some one had been telling my wife all that and saying that if my brother was giving this place to our sister it was not so much to please her as to tease her. \u2018He\u2019s such a teaser, Charlus,\u2019 was what they actually said. Well, you know Br\u00e9z\u00e9, it\u2019s a royal domain, I should say it\u2019s worth millions, it used to be part of the crown lands, it includes one of the finest forests in the whole of France. There are plenty of people who would be only too delighted to be teased to that tune. And so when she heard the word \u2018teaser\u2019 applied to Charlus because he was giving away such a magnificent property, Oriane could not help exclaiming, without meaning anything, I must admit, there wasn\u2019t a trace of ill-nature about it, for it came like a flash of lightning: \u2018Teaser, teaser? Then he must be Teaser Augustus.\u2019 You understand,\u201d he went on, resuming his sulky tone, having first cast a sweeping glance round the room in order to judge the effect of his wife\u2019s witticism \u2014 and in some doubt as to the extent of Mme. d\u2019Epinay\u2019s acquaintance with ancient history, \u201cyou understand, it\u2019s an allusion to Augustus Caesar, the Roman Emperor; it\u2019s too stupid, a bad play on words, quite unworthy of Oriane. And then, you see, I am more circumspect than my wife, if I haven\u2019t her wit, I think of the consequences; if anyone should be so ill-advised as to repeat the remark to my brother there\u2019ll be the devil to pay. All the more,\u201d he went on, \u201cbecause as you know Palam\u00e8de is very high and mighty, and very fussy also, given to gossip and all that sort of thing, so that quite apart from the question of his giving away Br\u00e9z\u00e9 you must admit that \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 suits him down to the ground. That is what justifies my wife\u2019s remarks; even when she is inclined to stoop to what is almost vulgar, she is always witty and does really describe people.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, thanks on one occasion to \u2018Teaser Augustus,\u2019 on another to something else, the visits paid by the Duke and Duchess to their kinsfolk replenished the stock of anecdotes, and the emotion which these visits aroused lasted long after the departure of the sparkling lady and her \u2018producer.\u2019 Her hostess would begin by going over again with the privileged persons who had been at the entertainment (those who had remained in the room) the clever things that Oriane had said. \u201cYou hadn\u2019t heard \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019?\u201d asked the Princesse d\u2019Epinay. \u201cYes,\u201d replied the Marquise de Baveno, blushing as she spoke, \u201cthe Princesse de Sarsina (the La Rochefoucauld one) mentioned it to me, not quite in the same words. But of course it was far more interesting to hear it repeated like that with my cousin in the room,\u201d she went on, as though speaking of a song that had been accompanied by the composer himself. \u201cWe were speaking of Oriane\u2019s latest \u2014 she was here just now,\u201d her hostess greeted a visitor who would be plunged in despair at not having arrived an hour earlier. \u201cWhat! Has Oriane been here?\u201d \u201cYes, you ought to have come a little sooner,\u201d the Princesse d\u2019Epinay informed her, not in reproach but letting her understand all that her clumsiness had made her miss. It was her fault alone if she had not been present at the Creation of the World or at Mme. Carvalho\u2019s last performance. \u201cWhat do you think of Oriane\u2019s latest? I must say, I do enjoy \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019,\u201d and the \u2018saying\u2019 would be served up again cold next day at luncheon before a few intimate friends who were invited on purpose, and would reappear under various sauces throughout the week. Indeed the Princess happening in the course of that week to pay her annual visit to the Princesse de Parme seized the opportunity to ask whether her Royal Highness had heard the pun, and repeated it to her. \u201cAh! Teaser Augustus,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, her eyes bulging with an instinctive admiration, which begged however for a complementary elucidation which Mme. d\u2019Epinay was not loath to furnish. \u201cI must say, \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 pleases me enormously as a piece of \u2018phrasing\u2019,\u201d she concluded. As a matter of fact the word \u2018phrasing\u2019 was not in the least applicable to this pun, but the Princesse d\u2019Epinay, who claimed to have assimilated her share of the Guermantes spirit, had borrowed from Oriane the expressions \u2018phrased\u2019 and \u2018phrasing\u2019 and employed them without much discrimination. New the Princesse de Parme, who was not at all fond of Mme. d\u2019Epinay, whom she considered plain, knew to be miserly and believed, on the authority of the Courvoisiers, to be malicious, recognised this word \u2018phrasing\u2019 which she had heard used by Mme. de Guermantes but would not by herself have known how or when to apply. She received the impression that it was in fact its \u2018phrasing\u2019 that formed the charm of \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 and, without altogether forgetting her antipathy towards the plain and miserly lady, could not repress a burst of admiration for a person endowed to such a degree with the Guermantes spirit, so strong that she was on the point of inviting the Princesse d\u2019Epinay to the Opera. She was held in check only by the reflexion that it would be wiser perhaps to consult Mme. de Guermantes first. As for Mme. d\u2019Epinay, who, unlike the Courvoisiers, paid endless attentions to Oriane and was genuinely fond of her but was jealous of her exalted friends and slightly irritated by the fun which the Duchess used to make of her before everyone on account of her meanness, she reported on her return home what an effort it had required to make the Princesse de Parme grasp the point of \u2018Teaser Augustus,\u2019 and declared what a snob Oriane must be to number such a goose among her friends. \u201cI should never have been able to see much of the Princesse de Parme even if I had cared to,\u201d she informed the friends who were dining with her. \u201cM. d\u2019Epinay would not have allowed it for a moment, because of her immorality,\u201d she explained, alluding to certain purely imaginary excesses on the part of the Princess. \u201cBut even if I had had a husband less strict in his views, I must say I could never have made friends with her. I don\u2019t know how Oriane can bear to see her every other day, as she does. I go there once a year, and it\u2019s all I can do to sit out my call.\u201d As for those of the Courvoisiers who happened to be at Victurnienne\u2019s on the day of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s visit, the arrival of the Duchess generally put them to flight owing to the exasperation they felt at the \u2018ridiculous salaams\u2019 that were made to her there. One alone remained on the afternoon of \u2018Teaser Augustus.\u2019 He did not entirely see the point, but he did see part of it, being an educated man. And the Courvoisiers went about repeating that Oriane had called uncle Palarned \u2018Caesar Augustus,\u2019 which was, according to them, a good enough descrin tion of him, but why all this endless talk about Oriane, they went on People couldn\u2019t make more fuss about a queen. \u201cAfter all, what is Oriane? I don\u2019t say that the Guermantes aren\u2019t an old family, but the Courvoisiers are every bit as good in rank, antiquity, marriages. We mustn\u2019t forget that on the Field of the Cloth of Gold, when the King of England asked Fran\u00e7ois I who was the noblest of the lords there present, \u2018Sire,\u2019 said the King of France, \u2018Courvoisier.\u2019\u201d But even if all the Courvoisiers had stayed in the room to hear them, Oriane\u2019s sayings would have fallen on deaf ears, since the incidents that usually gave occasion for those sayings would have been regarded by them from a totally different point of view. If, for instance, a Courvoisier found herself running short of chairs, in the middle of a party, or if she used the wrong name in greeting a guest whose face she did not remember, or if one of her servants said something stupid, the Courvoisier, extremely annoyed, flushed, quivering with excitement, would deplore so unfortunate an occurrence. And when she had a visitor in the room and Oriane was expected, she would say in a tone anxiously and imperiously questioning: \u201cDo you know her?\u201d, fearing that if the visitor did not know her his presence might make an unfortunate impression on Oriane. But Mme. de Guermantes on the contrary extracted from such incidents opportunities for stories which made the Guermantes laugh until the tears streamed down their cheeks, so that one was obliged to envy her her having run short of chairs, having herself made or having allowed her servant to make a blunder, having had at her party some one whom nobody knew, as one is obliged to be thankful that great writers have been kept at a distance by men and betrayed by women when their humiliations and their sufferings have been if not the direct stimulus of their genius, at any rate the subject matter of their works\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Courvoisiers were incapable of rising to the level of the spirit of innovation which the Duchesse de Guermantes introduced into the life of society and, by adapting it, following an unerring instinct, to the necessities of the moment, made into something artistic where the purely rational application of cut and dried rules would have given as unfortunate results as would greet a man who, anxious to succeed in love or in politics, was to reproduce in his own daily life the exploits of Bussy d\u2019Amboise. If the Courvoisiers gave a family dinner or a dinner to meet some prince, the addition of a recognised wit, of some friend of their son seemed to them an anomaly capable of producing the direst consequences. A Courvoisier whose father had been a Minister of the Empire having to give an afternoon party to meet Princesse Mathilde deduced by a geometrical formula that she could invite no one but Bonapartists. Of whom she knew practically none. All the smart women of her acquaintance, all the amusing men were ruthlessly barred because, from their Legitimist views or connexions, they might easily, according to Courvoisier logic, give offence to the Imperial Highness. The latter, who in her own house entertained the flower of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, was quite surprised when she found at Mme. de Courvoisier\u2019s only a notorious old sponger whose husband had been an Imperial Prefect, the widow of the Director of Posts and sundry others known for their loyalty to Napoleon, their stupidity and their dullness. Princesse Mathilde, however, in no way stinted the generous and refreshing shower of her sovereign grace over these miserable scarecrows whom the Duchesse de Guermantes, for her part, took good care not to invite when it was her turn to entertain the Princess, but substituted for them without any abstract reasoning about Bonapartism the most brilliant coruscation of all the beauties, all the talents, all the celebrities, who, the exercise of some subtle sixth sense made her feel, would be acceptable to the niece of the Emperor even when they belonged actually to the Royal House. There was not lacking indeed the Due d\u2019Aumale, and when on withdrawing the Princess, raising Mme. de Guermantes from the ground where she had sunk in a curtsey and was trying to kiss the august hand, embraced her on both cheeks, it was from the bottom of her heart that she was able to assure the Duchess that never had she spent a happier afternoon nor seen so delightful a party. The Princesse de Parme was Courvoisier in her incapacity for innovation in social matters, but unlike the Courvoisiers the surprise that was perpetually caused her by the Duchesse de Guermantes engendered in her not, as in them, antipathy but admiration. This astonishment was still farther enhanced by the infinitely backward state of the Princess\u2019s education. Mme. de Guermantes was herself a great deal less advanced than she supposed. But it was enough for her to have gone a little beyond Mme. de Parme to stupefy that lady, and, as the critics of each generation confine themselves to maintaining the direct opposite of the truths admitted by their predecessors, she had only to say that Flaubert, that archenemy of the bourgeois, had been bourgeois through and through, or that there was a great deal of Italian music in Wagner, to open before the Princess, at the cost of a nervous exhaustion which recurred every time, as before the eyes of a swimmer in a stormy sea, horizons that seemed to her unimaginable and remained for ever vague. A stupefaction caused also by the paradoxes uttered with relation not only to works of art but to persons of their acquaintance and to current social events. No doubt the incapacity that prevented Mme. de Parme from distinguishing the true wit of the Guermantes from certain rudimentarily acquired forms of that wit (which made her believe in the high intellectual worth of certain, especially certain female Guermantes, of whom she was bewildered on hearing the Duchess confide to her with a smile that they were mere blockheads) was one of the causes of the astonishment which the Princess always felt on hearing Mme. de Guermantes criticise other people. But there was another cause also, one which I, who knew at this time more books than people and literature better than life, explained to myself by thinking that the Duchess, living this wordly life the idleness and sterility of which are to a true social activity what criticism, in art, is to creation, extended to the persons who surrounded her the instability of point of view, the uneasy thirst of the reasoner who to assuage a mind that has grown too dry goes in search of no matter what paradox that is still fairly new, and will make no bones about upholding the refreshing opinion that the really great Iphig\u00e9nie is Piccini\u2019s and not Gluck\u2019s, at a pinch the true Ph\u00e8dre that of Pradon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a woman who was intelligent, educated, witty had married a shy bumpkin whom one saw but seldom and never heard, Mme. de Guermantes one fine day would find a rare intellectual pleasure not only in decrying the wife but in \u2018discovering\u2019 the husband. In the Cambremer household for example, if she had lived in that section of society at the time, she would have decreed that Mme. de Cambremer was stupid, and that the really interesting person, misunderstood, delightful, condemned to silence by a chattering wife but himself worth a thousand of her, was the Marquis, and the Duchess would have felt on declaring this the same kind of refreshment as the critic who, after people have for seventy years been admiring Hernani, confesses to a preference for Le Lion Amoureux. And from this same morbid need of arbitrary novelties, if from her girlhood everyone had been pitying a model wife, a true saint, for being married to a scoundrel, one fine day Mme. de Guermantes would assert that this scoundrel was perhaps a frivolous man but one with a heart of gold, whom the implacable harshness of his wife had driven to do the most inconsistent things. I knew that it is not only over different works, in the long course of centuries, but over different parts of the same work that criticism plays, thrusting back into the shadow what for too long has been thought brilliant, and making emerge what has appeared to be doomed to permanent obscurity. I had not only seen Bellini, Winterhalter, the Jesuit architects, a Restoration cabinetmaker come to take the place of men of genius who were called \u2018worn out,\u2019 simply because they had worn out the lazy minds of the intellectuals, as neurasthenics are always worn out and always changing; I had seen preferred in Sainte-Beuve alternately the critic and the poet, Musset rejected so far as his poetry went save for a few quite unimportant little pieces. No doubt certain essayists are mistaken when they set above the most famous scenes in Le Cid or Polyeucte some speech from Le Menteur which, like an old plan, furnishes information about the Paris of the day, but their predilection, justified if not by considerations of beauty at least by a documentary interest, is still too rational for our criticism run mad. It will barter the whole of Moli\u00e8re for a line fromL\u2019Etourdi, and even when it pronounces Wagner\u2019s Tristan a bore will except a \u2018charming note on the horns\u2019 at the point where the hunt goes by. This depravation of taste helped me to understand that of which Mme. de Guermantes gave proof when she decided that a man of their world, recognised as a good fellow but a fool, was a monster of egoism, sharper than people thought \u2014 that another widely known for his generosity might be the personification of avarice, that a good mother paid no attention to her children, and that a woman generally supposed to be vicious was really actuated by the noblest feelings. As though spoiled by the nullity of life in society, the intelligence and perception of Mme. de Guermantes were too vacillating for disgust not to follow pretty swiftly in the wake of infatuation (leaving her still ready to feel herself attracted afresh by the kind of cleverness which she had in turn sought out and abandoned) and for the charm which she had felt in some warm-hearted man not to change, if he came too often to see her, sought too freely from her directions which she was incapable of giving him, into an irritation which she believed to be produced by her admirer but which was in fact due to the utter impossibility of finding pleasure when one does nothing else than seek it. The variations of the Duchess\u2019s judgment spared no one, except her husband. He alone had never been in love with her, in him she had always felt an iron character, indifferent to the caprices that she displayed, contemptuous of her beauty, violent, of a will that would never bend, the sort under which alone nervous people can find tranquillity. M. de Guermantes on the other hand, pursuing a single type of feminine beauty but seeking it in mistresses whom he constantly replaced, had, once he had left them, and to express derision of them, only an associate, permanent and identical, who irritated him often by her chatter but as to whom he knew that everyone regarded her as the most beautiful, the most virtuous, the cleverest, the best-read member of the aristocracy, as a wife whom he, M. de Guermantes, was only too fortunate to have found, who cloaked all his irregularities, entertained like no one else in the world, and upheld for their drawing-room its position as the premier in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. This common opinion he himself shared; often moved to ill-humour against her, he was proud of her. If, being as niggardly as he was fastidious, he refused her the most trifling sums for her charities or for the servants, yet he insisted upon her wearing the most sumptuous clothes and driving behind the best horses in Paris. Whenever Mme. de Guermantes had just perpetrated, with reference to the merits and defects, which she suddenly transposed, of one of their friends, a new and succulent paradox, she burned to make trial of it before people capable of relishing it, to bring out its psychological originality and to set its epigrammatic brilliance sparkling. No doubt these new opinions embodied as a rule no more truth than the old, often less; but this very element, arbitrary and incalculable, of novelty which they contained conferred on them something intellectual which made the communication of them exciting. Only the patient on whom the Duchess was exercising her psychological skill was generally an intimate friend as to whom those people to whom she longed to hand on her discovery were entirely unaware that he was not still at the apex of her favour; thus the reputation that Mme. de Guermantes had of being an incomparable friend, sentimental, tender and devoted, made it difficult for her to launch the attack herself; she could at the most intervene later on, as though under constraint, by uttering a response to appease, to contradict in appearance but actually to support a partner who had taken it on himself to provoke her; this was precisely the part in which M. de Guermantes excelled\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for social activities, it was yet another form of pleasure, arbitrary and spectacular, that Mme. de Guermantes felt in uttering, with regard to them, those unexpected judgments which pricked with an incessant and exquisite feeling of surprise the Princesse de Parme. But with this one of the Duchess\u2019s pleasures it was not so much with the help of literary criticism as by following political life and the reports of parliamentary debates that I tried to understand in what it might consist. The successive and contradictory edicts by which Mme. de Guermantes continually reversed the scale of values among the people of her world no longer sufficing to distract her, she sought also in the manner in which she ordered her own social behaviour, in which she recorded her own most trivial decisions on points of fashion, to taste those artificial emotions, to fulfil those adventitious obligations which stimulate the perceptions of Parliaments and gain hold of the minds of politicians. We know that when a Minister explains to the Chamber that he believed himself to be acting rightly in following a line of conduct which does, as a matter of fact, appear quite straightforward to the commonsense person who next morning in his newspaper reads the report of the sitting, this commonsense reader does nevertheless feel himself suddenly stirred and begins to doubt whether he has been right in approving the Minister\u2019s conduct when he sees that the latter\u2019s speech was listened to with the accompaniment of a lively agitation and punctuated with expressions of condemnation such as: \u201cIt\u2019s most serious!\u201d ejaculated by a Deputy whose name and titles are so long, and followed in the report by movements so emphatic that in the whole interruption the words \u201cIt\u2019s most serious!\u201d occupy less room than a hemistich does in an alexandrine. For instance in the days when M. de Guermantes, Prince des Laumes, sat in the Chamber, one used to read now and then in the Paris newspapers, albeit it was intended primarily for the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise division, to shew the electors there that they had not given their votes to an inactive or voiceless mandatory:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Monsieur de Guermantes-Bouillon, Prince des Laumes: \u201cThis is serious!\u201d \u201cHear, hear!\u201d from the Centre and some of the Right benches, loud exclamations from the Extreme Left.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The commonsense reader still retains a gleam of faith in the sage Minister, but his heart is convulsed with a fresh palpitation by the first words of the speaker who rises to reply:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe astonishment, it is not too much to say the stupor\u201d (keen sensation on the Right side of the House) \u201cthat I have felt at the words of one who is still, I presume, a member of the Government\u201d (thunder of applause) . . . Several Under-Secretaries of State for Posts and Telegraphs without Deputies then crowded round the Ministerial bench. Then rising from his seat, nodded his head in the affirmative\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This \u2018thunder of applause\u2019 carries away the last shred of resistance in the mind of the commonsense reader; he discovers to be an insult to the Chamber, monstrous in fact, a course of procedure which in itself is of no importance; it may be some normal action such as arranging that the rich shall pay more than the poor, bringing to light some piece of injustice, preferring peace to war; he will find it scandalous and will see in it an offence to certain principles to which as a matter of fact he had never given a thought, which are not engraved on the human heart, but which move him forcibly by reason of the acclamations which they provoke and the compact majorities which they assemble\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must at the same time be recognised that this subtlety of the politician which served to explain to me the Guermantes circle, and other groups in society later on, is nothing more than the perversion of a certain fineness of interpretation often described as \u2018reading between the lines.\u2019 If in representative assemblies there is absurdity owing to perversion of this quality, there is equally stupidity, through the want of it, in the public who take everything \u2018literally,\u2019 who do not suspect a dismissal when a high dignitary is relieved of his office \u2018at his own request,\u2019 and say: \u201cHe cannot have been dismissed, since it was he who asked leave to retire,\u201d\u2014 a defeat when the Russians by a strategic movement withdraw upon a stronger position that has been prepared beforehand, a refusal when, a Province having demanded its independence from the German Emperor, he grants it religious autonomy. It is possible, moreover (to return to these sittings of the Chamber), that when they open the Deputies themselves are like the commonsense person who will read the published report. Learning that certain workers on strike have sent their delegates to confer with a Minister, they may ask one another innocently: \u201cThere now, I wonder what they can have been saying; let\u2019s hope it\u2019s all settled,\u201d at the moment when the Minister himself mounts the tribune in a solemn silence which has already brought artificial emotions into play. The first words of the Minister: \u201cThere is no necessity for me to inform the Chamber that I have too high a sense of what is the duty of the Government to have received a deputation of which the authority entrusted to me could take no cognisance,\u201d produce a dramatic effect, for this was the one hypothesis which the commonsense of the Deputies had not imagined. But precisely because of its dramatic effect it is greeted with such applause that it is only after several minutes have passed that the Minister can succeed in making himself heard, the Minister who will receive on returning to his place on the bench the congratulations of his colleagues. We are as deeply moved as on the day when the same Minister failed to invite to a big official reception the President of the Municipal Council who was supporting the Opposition, and declare that on this occasion as on the other he has acted with true statesmanship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes at this period in his life had, to the great scandal of the Courvoisiers, frequently been among the crowd of Deputies who came forward to congratulate the Minister. I have heard it said afterwards that even at a time when he was playing a fairly important part in the Chamber and was being thought of in connexion with Ministerial office or an Embassy he was, when a friend came to ask a favour of him, infinitely more simple, behaved politically a great deal less like the important political personage than anyone else who did not happen to be Duc de Guermantes. For if he said that nobility made no difference, that he regarded his fellow Deputies as equals, he did not believe it for a moment. He sought, pretended to value but really despised political importance, and as he remained in his own eyes M. de Guermantes it did not envelop his person in that dead weight of high office which makes other politicians unapproachable. And in this way his pride guarded against every assault not only his manners which were of an ostentatious familiarity but also such true simplicity as he might actually have\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to those artificial and moving decisions such as are made by politicians, Mme. de Guermantes was no less disconcerting to the Guermantes, the Courvoisiers, the Faubourg in general and, more than anyone, the Princesse de Parme by her habit of issuing unaccountable decrees behind which one could feel to be latent principles which impressed one all the more, the less one expected them. If the new Greek Minister have a fancy dress ball, everyone chose a costume and asked everyone else what the Duchess would wear. One thought that she would appear as the Duchesse de Bourgogne, another suggested as probable the guise of Princess of Dujabar, a third Psyche. Finally, a Courvoisier having asked her: \u201cWhat are you going to wear, Oriane?\u201d provoked the one response of which nobody had thought: \u201cWhy, nothing at all!\u201d which at once set every tongue wagging, as revealing Oriane\u2019s opinion as to the true social position of the new Greek Minister and the proper attitude to adopt towards him, that is to say the opinion which ought to have been foreseen namely that a duchess \u2018was not expected\u2019 to attend the fancy dress bali given by this new Minister: \u201cI do not see that there is any necessity to go to the Greek Minister\u2019s; I do not know him; I am not a Greek; why should I go to these people\u2019s house, I have nothing to do with them?\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cBut everybody will be there, they say it\u2019s going to be charming!\u201d cried Mme. de Gallardon. \u201cStill, it\u2019s just as charming sometimes to sit by one\u2019s own fireside,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes. The Courvoisiers could not get over this, but the Guermantes, without copying it, approved of their cousin\u2019s attitude. \u201cNaturally, everybody isn\u2019t in a position like Oriane to break with all the conventions. But if you look at it in one way you can\u2019t say she was actually wrong in wishing to shew that we are going rather far in flinging ourselves at the feet of all these foreigners who appear from heaven knows where.\u201d Naturally, knowing the stream of comment which one or other attitude would not fail to provoke, Mme. de Guermantes took as much pleasure in appearing at a party to which her hostess had not dared to count on her coming as in staying at home or spending the evening at the play with her husband on the night of a party to which \u2018everybody was going,\u2019 or, again, when people imagined that she would eclipse the finest diamonds with some historic diadem, by stealing into the room without a single jewel, and in another style of dress than what had been, wrongly, supposed to be essential to the occasion. Albeit she was anti-Dreyfusard (while retaining her belief in the innocence of Dreyfus, just as she spent her life in the social world believing only in abstract ideas) she had created an enormous sensation at a party at the Princesse de Ligne\u2019s, first of all by remaining seated after all the ladies had risen to their feet as General Mercier entered the room, and then by getting up and in a loud voice asking for her carriage when a Nationalist orator had begun to address the gathering, thereby shewing that she did not consider that society was meant for talking politics; all heads were turned towards her at a Good Friday concert at which, although a Voltairean, she had not remained because she thought it indecent to bring Christ upon the stage. We know how important, even for the great queens of society, is that moment of the year at which the round of entertainment begins: so much so that the Marquise d\u2019Amoncourt, who, from a need to say something, a form of mania, and also from want of perception, was always making a fool of herself, had actually replied to somebody who had called to condole with her on the death of her father, M. de Montmorency: \u201cWhat makes it sadder still is that it should come at a time when one\u2019s mirror is simply stuffed with cards!\u201d Very well, at this point in the social year, when people invited the Duchesse de Guermantes to dinner, making every effort to see that she was not already engaged, she declined, for the one reason of which nobody in society would ever have thought; she was just starting on a cruise among the Norwegian fjords, which were so interesting. People in society were stupefied, and, without any thought of following the Duchess\u2019s example, derived nervertheless from her action that sense of relief which one has in reading Kant when after the most rigorous demonstration of determinism one finds that above the world of necessity there is the world of freedom. Every invention of which no one has ever thought before excites the interest even of people who can derive no benefit from it. That of steam navigation was a small thing compared with the employment of steam navigation at that sedentary time of year called \u2018the season.\u2019 The idea that anyone could voluntarily renounce a hundred dinners or luncheons, twice as many afternoon teas, three times as many evening parties, the most brilliant Mondays at the Opera and Tuesdays at the Fran\u00e7ais to visit the Norwegian fjords seemed to the Courvoisiers no more explicable than the idea of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, but conveyed to them a similar impression of independence and charm. So that not a day passed on which somebody might not be heard to ask, not merely: \u201cYou\u2019ve heard Oriane\u2019s latest joke?\u201d but \u201cYou know Oriane\u2019s latest?\u201d and on \u2018Oriane\u2019s latest\u2019 as on \u2018Oriane\u2019s latest joke\u2019 would follow the comment: \u201cHow typical of Oriane!\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t that pure Oriane?\u201d Oriane\u2019s latest might be, for instance, that, having to write on behalf of a patriotic society to Cardinal X \u2014 Bishop of Macon (whom M. de Guermantes when he spoke of him invariably called \u2018Monsieur de Mascon,\u2019 thinking this to be \u2018old French\u2019), when everyone was trying to imagine what form the letter would take, and had no difficulty as to the opening words, the choice lying between \u2018Eminence,\u2019 and \u2018Monseigneur,\u2019 but was puzzled as to the rest, Oriane\u2019s letter, to the general astonishment, began: \u2018Monsieur le Cardinal,\u2019 following an old academic form, or: \u2018My Cousin,\u2019 this term being in use among the Princes of the Church, the Gsermantes and Crowned Heads, who prayed to God to take each and all of them into \u2018His fit and holy keeping.\u2019 To start people on the topic of an \u2018Oriane\u2019s latest\u2019 it was sufficient that at a performance at which all Paris was present and a most charming play was being given, when they looked for Mme. de Guermantes in the boxes of the Princesse de Parme, the Princesse de Guermantes, countless other ladies who had invited her, they discovered her sitting by herself, in black, with a tiny hat on her head, in a stall in which she had arrived before the curtain rose. \u201cYou hear better, when it\u2019s a play that\u2019s worth listening to,\u201d she explained, to the scandal of the Courvoisiers and the admiring bewilderment of the Guermantes and the Princesse de Parme, who suddenly discovered that the \u2018fashion\u2019 of hearing the beginning of a play was more up to date, was a proof of greater originality and intelligence (which need not astonish them, coming from Oriane) than that of arriving for the last act after a big dinner-party and \u2018going on\u2019 somewhere first. Such were the various kinds of surprise for which the Princesse de Parme knew that she ought to be prepared if she put a literary or social question to Mme. de Guermantes, one result of which was that during these dinner-parties at Oriane\u2019s her Royal Highness never ventured upon the slightest topic save with the uneasy and enraptured prudence of the bather emerging from between two breakers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among the elements which, absent from the three or four other more or less equivalent drawing-rooms that set the fashion for the Faubourg Saint-Germain, differentiated from them that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, just as Leibniz allows that each monad, while reflecting the entire universe, adds to it something of its own, one of the least attractive was regularly furnished by one or two extremely good-looking women who had no title to be there apart from their beauty and the use that M. de Guermantes had made of them, and whose presence revealed at once, as does in other drawing-rooms that of certain otherwise unaccountable pictures, that in this household the husband was an ardent appreciator of feminine graces. They were all more or less alike, for the Duke had a taste for large women, at once statuesque and loose-limbed, of a type half-way between the Venus of Milo and the Samothracian Victory; often fair, rarely dark, sometimes auburn, like the most recent, who was at this dinner, that Vicomtesse d\u2019Arpajon whom he had loved so well that for a long time he had obliged her to send him as many as ten telegrams daily (which slightly annoyed the Duchess), corresponded with her by carrier pigeon when he was at Guermantes, and from whom moreover he had long been so incapable of tearing himself away that, one winter which he had had to spend at Parma, he travelled back regularly every week to Paris, spending two days in the train, in order to see her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a rule these handsome \u2018supers\u2019 had been his mistresses but were no longer (as was Mme. d\u2019Arpajon\u2019s case) or were on the point of ceasing to be so. It may well have been that the importance which the Duchess enjoyed in their sight and the hope of being invited to her house, though they themselves came of thoroughly aristocratic, but still not quite first-class stock, had prompted them, even more than the good looks and generosity of the Duke, to yield to his desires. Not that the Duchess would have placed any insuperable obstacle in the way of their crossing her threshold: she was aware that in more than one of them she had found an ally, thanks to whom she had obtained a thousand things which she wanted but which M. de Guermantes pitilessly denied his wife so long as he was not in love with some one else. And so the reason why they were not invited by the Duchess until their intimacy with the Duke was already far advanced lay principally in the fact that he, every time that he had embarked on the deep waters of love, had imagined nothing more than a brief flirtation, as a reward for which he considered an invitation from his wife to be more than adequate. And yet he found himself offering this as the price of far less, for a first kiss in fact, because a resistance upon which he had never reckoned had been brought into play or because there had been no resistance. In love it often happens that gratitude, the desire to give pleasure, makes us generous beyond the limits of what the other person\u2019s expectation and self-interest could have anticipated. But then the realisation of this offer was hindered by conflicting circumstances. In the first place, all the women who had responded to M. de Guermantes\u2019s love, and sometimes even when they had not yet surrendered themselves to him, he had, one after another, segregated from the world. He no longer allowed them to see anyone, spent almost all his time in their company, looked after the education of their children to whom now and again, if one was to judge by certain speaking likenesses later on, he had occasion to present a little brother or sister. And so if, at the start of the connexion, the prospect of an introduction to Mme. de Guermantes, which had never crossed the mind of the Duke, had entered considerably into the thoughts of his mistress, their connexion had by itself altered the whole of the lady\u2019s point of view; the Duke was no longer for her merely the husband of the smartest woman in Paris, but a man with whom his new mistress was in love, a man moreover who had given her the means and the inclination for a more luxurious style of living and had transposed the relative importance in her mind of questions of social and of material advantage; while now and then a composite jealousy, into which all these factors entered, of Mme. de Guermantes animated the Duke\u2019s mistresses. But this case was the rarest of all; besides, when the day appointed for the introduction at length arrived (at a point when as a rule the Duke had lost practically all interest in the matter, his actions, like everyone\u2019s else, being generally dictated by previous actions the prime motive of which had already ceased to exist), it frequently happened that it was Mme. de Guermantes who had sought the acquaintance of the mistress in whom she hoped, and so greatly needed, to discover, against her dread husband, a valuable ally. This is not to say that, save at rare moments, in their own house, where, when the Duchess talked too much, he let fall a few words or, more dreadful still, preserved a silence which rendered her speechless, M. de Guermantes failed in his outward relations with his wife to observe what are called the forms. People who did not know them might easily misunderstand. Sometimes between the racing at Deauville, the course of waters and the return to Guermantes for the shooting, in the few weeks which people spend in Paris, since the Duchess had a liking for caf\u00e9-concerts, the Duke would go with her to spend the evening at one of these. The audience remarked at once, in one of those little open boxes in which there is just room for two, this Hercules in his \u2018smoking\u2019 (for in France we give to everything that is more or less British the one name that it happens not to bear in England), his monocle screwed in his eye, in his plump but finely shaped hand, on the ring-finger of which there glowed a sapphire, a plump cigar from which now and then he drew a puff of smoke, keeping his eyes for the most part on the stage but, when he did let them fall upon the audience in which there was absolutely no one whom he knew, softening them with an air of gentleness, reserve, courtesy and consideration. When a verse struck him as amusing and not too indecent, the Duke would turn round with a smile to his wife, letting her share, by a twinkle of good-natured understanding, the innocent merriment which the new song had aroused in himself. And the spectators might believe that there was no better husband in the world than this, nor anyone more enviable than the Duchess \u2014 that woman outside whom every interest in the Duke\u2019s life lay, that woman with whom he was not in love, to whom he had been consistently unfaithful; when the Duchess felt tired, they saw M. de Guermantes rise, put on her cloak with his own hands, arranging her necklaces so that they did not catch in the lining, and clear a path for her to the street with an assiduous and respectful attention which she received with the coldness of the woman of the world who sees in such behaviour simply conventional politeness, at times even with the slightly ironical bitterness of the disabused spouse who has no illusion left to shatter. But despite these externals (another element of that politeness which has made duty evolve from the depths of our being to the surface, at a period already remote but still continuing for its survivors) the life of the Duchess was by no means easy. M. de Guermantes never became generous or human save for a new mistress who would take, as it generally happened, the Duchess\u2019s part; the latter saw becoming possible for her once again generosities towards inferiors, charities to the poor, even for herself, later on, a new and sumptuous motor-car. But from the irritation which developed as a rule pretty rapidly in Mme. de Guermantes at people whom she found too submissive the Duke\u2019s mistresses were not exempt. Presently the Duchess grew tired of them. Simultaneously, at this moment, the Duke\u2019s intimacy with Mme. d\u2019Arpajon was drawing to an end. Another mistress dawned on the horizon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt the love which M. de Guermantes had had for each of them in succession would begin one day to make itself felt afresh; in the first place, this love in dying bequeathed them, like beautiful marbles \u2014 marbles beautiful to the Duke, become thus in part an artist, because he had loved them and was sensitive now to lines which he would not have appreciated without love \u2014 which brought into juxtaposition in the Duchess\u2019s drawing-room their forms long inimical, devoured by jealousies and quarrels, and finally reconciled in the peace of friendship; besides, this friendship itself was an effect of the love which had made M. de Guermantes observe in those who were his mistresses virtues which exist in every human being but are perceptible only to the sensual eye, so much so that the ex-mistr\u00eass, become \u2018the best of comrades\u2019 who would do anything in the world for one, is as recognised a type as the doctor or father who is not a doctor or a father but a friend. But during a period of transition the woman whom M. de Guermantes was preparing to abandon bewailed her lot, made scenes, shewed herself exacting, appeared indiscreet, became a nuisance. The Duke began to take a dislike to her. Then Mme. de Guermantes had an opportunity to bring into prominence the real or imagined defects of a person who annoyed her. Known as a kind woman, Mme. de Guermantes received the telephone messages, the confidences, the tears of the abandoned mistress and made no complaint. She laughed at them, first with her husband, then with a few chosen friends. And imagining that this pity which she shewed for the poor wretch gave her the right to make fun of her, even to her face, whatever the lady might say, provided it could be included among the attributes of the character for absurdity which the puke and Duchess had recently fabricated for her, Mme. de Guermantes had no hesitation in exchanging with her husband a glance of ironical connivance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, as she sat down to table, the Princesse de Parme remembered that she had thought of inviting a certain other Princess to the Opera, and, wishing to be assured that this would not in any way offend Mme. de Guermantes, was preparing to sound her. At this moment there entered M. de Grouchy, whose train, owing to some block on the line, had been held up for an hour. He made what excuses he could. His wife, had she been a Courvoisier, would have died of shame. But Mme. de Grouchy was not a Guermantes for nothing. As her husband was apologising for being late:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI see,\u201d she broke in, \u201cthat even in little things arriving late is a tradition in your family.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSit down, Grouchy, and don\u2019t let them pull your leg,\u201d said the Duke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope I move with the times, still I must admit that the Battle of Waterloo had its points, since it brought about the Restoration of the Bourbons, and better still in a way which made them unpopular. But you seem to be a regular Nimrod!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, as a matter of fact, I have had quite a good bag. I shall take the liberty of sending the Duchess six brace of pheasants to-morrow.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An idea seemed to flicker in the eyes of Mme. de Guermantes. She insisted that M. de Grouchy must not give himself the trouble of sending the pheasants. And making a sign to the betrothed footman with whom I had exchanged a few words on my way from the Elstir room:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPoullein,\u201d she told him, \u201cyou will go to-morrow and fetch M. le Comte\u2019s pheasants and bring them straight back \u2014 you won\u2019t mind, will you, Grouchy, if I make a few little presents. Basin and I can\u2019t eat a whole dozen by ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut the day after to-morrow will be soon enough,\u201d said M. de Grouchy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, to-morrow suits me better,\u201d the Duchess insisted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Poullein had turned pale; his appointment with his sweetheart would have to be missed. This was quite enough for the diversion of the Duchess, who liked to appear to be taking a human interest in everyone. \u201cI know it\u2019s your day out,\u201d she went on to Poullein, \u201call you\u2019ve got to do is to change with Georges; he can take to-morrow off and stay in the day after.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the day after, Poullein\u2019s sweetheart would not be free. A holiday then was of no account to him. As soon as he was out of the room, everyone complimented the Duchess on the interest she took in her servants. \u201cBut I only behave towards them as I like people to behave to me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just it. They can say they\u2019ve found a good place with you.\u201d \u201cOh, nothing so very wonderful. But I think they all like me. That one is a little annoying because he\u2019s in love. He thinks it incumbent on him to go about with a long face.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point Poullein reappeared. \u201cYou\u2019re quite right,\u201d said M. de Grouchy, \u201che doesn\u2019t look much like smiling. With those fellows one has to be good but not too good.\u201d \u201cI admit I\u2019m not a very dreadful mistress. He\u2019ll have nothing to do all day but call for your pheasants, sit in the house doing nothing and eat his share of them.\u201d \u201cThere are plenty of people who would be glad to be in his place,\u201d said M. de Grouchy, for envy makes men blind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOriane,\u201d began the Princesse de Parme, \u201cI had a visit the other day from your cousin Heudicourt; of course she\u2019s a highly intelligent woman \u2014 she\u2019s a Guermantes, one can say no more, but they tell me she has a spitel ful tongue.\u201d The Duke fastened on his wife a slow gaze of deliberate stupefaction. Mme. de Guermantes began to smile. Gradually the Princess became aware of their pantomime. \u201cBut . . . do you mean to say you don\u2019t agree with me?\u201d she stammered with growing uneasiness. \u201cReally Ma\u2019am, it\u2019s too good of you to pay any attention to Basin\u2019s faces. Now\u2019 Basin, you\u2019re not to hint nasty things about our cousins.\u201d \u201cHe thinks her too wicked?\u201d inquired the Princess briskly. \u201cOh, dear me, no!\u201d replied the Duchess. \u201cI don\u2019t know who told your Highness that she was spiteful. On the contrary, she\u2019s an excellent creature who never said any harm of anyone, or did any harm to any one.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d sighed Mme. de Parme, greatly relieved. \u201cI must say I never noticed anything myself. But I know it\u2019s often difficult not to be a little spiteful when one is so full of wit . . . \u201d \u201cAh! Now that is a quality of which she has even less.\u201d \u201cLess wit?\u201d asked the stupefied Princess. \u201cCome now, Oriane,\u201d broke in the Duke in a plaintive tone, casting to right and left of him a glance of amusement, \u201cyou heard the Princess tell you that she was a superior woman.\u201d \u201cBut isn\u2019t she?\u201d \u201cSuperior in chest measurement, at any rate.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Ma\u2019am, he\u2019s not sincere; she\u2019s as stupid as a (h\u2019m) goose,\u201d came in a loud and rasping voice from Mme. de Guermantes, who, a great deal more \u2018old French\u2019 even than the Duke when he was not trying, did often deliberately seek to be, but in a manner the opposite of the lace-neckcloth, deliquescent style of her husband and in reality far more subtle, by a sort of almost peasant pronunciation which had a harsh and delicious flavour of the soil. \u201cBut she\u2019s the best woman in the world. Besides, I don\u2019t really know that one can call it stupidity when it\u2019s carried to such a point as that. I don\u2019t believe I ever met anyone quite like her; she\u2019s a case for a specialist, there\u2019s something pathological about her, she\u2019s a sort of \u2018innocent\u2019 or \u2018cretin\u2019 or an \u2018arrested development,\u2019 like the people you see in melodramas, or in L\u2019Arl\u00e9sienne. I always ask myself, when she comes to see me, whether the moment may not have arrived at which her intelligence is going to dawn, which makes me a little nervous always.\u201d The Princess was lost in admiration of these utterances but remained stupefied by the preceding verdict. \u201cShe repeated to me \u2014 and so did Mme. d\u2019Epinay \u2014 what you said about \u2018Teaser Augustus.\u2019 It\u2019s delicious,\u201d she put in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes explained the joke to me. I wanted to tell him that his brother, who pretended not to know me, was expecting me that same evening at eleven o\u2019clock. But I had not asked Robert whether I might mention this engagement, and as the fact that M. de Charlus had practically fixed it with me himself directly contradicted what he had told the Duchess I judged it more tactful to say nothing. \u201c\u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 was not bad,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, \u201cbut Mme. d\u2019Heudicourt probably did not tell you a far better thing that Oriane said to her the other day in reply to an invitation to luncheon.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed! Do tell me!\u201d \u201cNow Basin, you keep quiet; in the first place, it was a stupid remark, and it will make the Princess think me inferior even to my fool of a cousin. Though I don\u2019t know why I should call her my cousin. She\u2019s one of Basin\u2019s cousins. Still, I believe she is related to me in some sort of way.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d cried the Princesse de Parme, at the idea that she could possibly think Mme. de Guermantes stupid, and protesting helplessly that nothing could ever lower the Duchess from the place she held in her estimation. \u201cBesides we have already subtracted from her the quality of wit; as what I said to her tends to deny her certain other good qualities also, it seems to me inopportune to repeat it.\u201d \u201c\u2018Deny her!\u2019 \u2018Inopportune!\u2019 How well she expresses herself!\u201d said the Duke with a pretence of irony, to win admiration for the Duchess. \u201cNow, then, Basin, you\u2019re not to make fun of your wife.\u201d \u201cI should explain to your Royal Highness,\u201d went on the Duke, \u201cthat Oriane\u2019s cousin may be superior, good, stout, anything you like to mention, but she is not exactly \u2014 what shall I say \u2014 lavish.\u201d \u201cNo, I know, she\u2019s terribly close-fisted,\u201d broke in the Princess. \u201cI should not have ventured to use the expression, but you have hit on exactly the right word. You can see it in her house-keeping, and especially in the cooking, which is excellent, but strictly rationed.\u201d \u201cWhich leads to some quite amusing scenes,\u201d M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 interrupted him. \u201cFor instance, my dear Basin, I was down at Heudicourt one day when you were expected, Oriane and yourself. They had made the most elaborate preparations when, during the afternoon, a footman brought in a telegram to say that you weren\u2019t coming.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me!\u201d said the Duchess, who not only was difficult to secure, but liked people to know as much. \u201cYour cousin read the telegram, was duly distressed, then immediately, without losing her head, telling herself that there was no point in going to unnecessary expense for so unimportant a gentleman as myself, called the footman back. \u2018Tell the cook not to put on the chicken!\u2019 she shouted after him. And that evening I heard her asking the butler: \u2018Well? What about the beef that was left over yesterday? Aren\u2019t you going to let us have that?\u2019\u201d \u201cAll the same, one must admit that the cheer you get there is of the very best,\u201d said the Duke, who fancied that in using this language he shewed himself to belong to the old school. \u201cI don\u2019t know any house where one gets better food.\u201d \u201cOr less,\u201d put in the Duchess. \u201cIt is quite wholesome and quite enough for what you would call a vulgar yokel like myself,\u201d went on the Duke, \u201cone keeps one\u2019s appetite.\u201d \u201cOh, if it\u2019s to be taken as a cure, it\u2019s certainly more hygienic than sumptuous. Not that it\u2019s as good as all that,\u201d added Mme. de Guermantes, who was not at all pleased that the title of \u2018best table in Paris\u2019 should be awarded to any but her own. \u201cWith my cousin it\u2019s just the same as with those costive authors who hatch out every fifteen years a one-act play or a sonnet. The sort of thing people call a little masterpiece, trifles that are perfect gems, in fact the one thing I loathe most in the world. The cooking at Z\u00e9na\u00efde\u2019s is not bad, but you would think it more ordinary if she was less parsimonious. There are some things her cook does quite well, and others that he spoils. I have had some thoroughly bad dinners there, as in most houses, only they\u2019ve done me less harm there because the stomach is, after all, more sensitive to quantity than to quality.\u201d \u201cWell, to get on with the story,\u201d the Duke concluded \u201cZ\u00e9na\u00efde insisted that Oriane should go to luncheon there, and as my wife is not very fond of going out anywhere she resisted, wanted to be sure that under the pretence of a quiet meal she was not being trapped into some great banquet, and tried in vain to find out who else were to be of the party. \u2018You must come,\u2019 Z\u00e9na\u00efde insisted, boasting of all the good things there would be to eat. \u2018You are going to have a pur\u00e9e of chestnuts, I need say no more than that, and there will be seven littlebouch\u00e9es \u00e0 la reine.\u2019 \u2018Seven little bouch\u00e9es!\u2019 cried Oriane, \u2018that means that we shall be at least eightl\u2019\u201d There was silence for a few seconds, and then the Princess having seen the point let her laughter explode like a peal of thunder. \u201cAh! \u2018Then we shall be eight,\u2019\u2014 it\u2019s exquisite. How very well phrased!\u201d she said, having by a supreme effort recaptured the expression she had heard used by Mme. d\u2019Epinay, which this time was more appropriate. \u201cOriane, that was very charming of the Princess, she said your remark was well phrased.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear, you\u2019re telling me nothing new. I know how clever the Princess is,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, who readily assimilated a remark when it was uttered at once by a Royal Personage and in praise of her own wit. \u201cI am very proud that Ma\u2019am should appreciate my humble phrasings. I don\u2019t remember, though, that I ever did say such a thing, and if I did it must have been to flatter my cousin, for if she had ordered seven \u2018mouthfuls,\u2019 the mouths, if I may so express myself, would have been a round dozen if not more.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe used to have all M. de Bornier\u2019s manuscripts,\u201d went on the Princess, still speaking of Mme. d\u2019Heudicourt, and anxious to make the most of the excellent reasons she might have for associating with that lady. \u201cShe must have dreamed it, I don\u2019t believe she ever even know him,\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cWhat is really interesting about him is that he kept up a correspondence with people of different nationalities at the same time,\u201d put in the Vicomtesse d\u2019Arpajon who, allied to the principal ducal and even reigning families of Europe, was always glad that people should be reminded of the fact. \u201cSurely, Oriane,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, with ulterior purpose, \u201cyou can\u2019t have forgotten that dinner-party where you had M. de Bornier sitting next to you!\u201d \u201cBut, Basin,\u201d the Duchess interrupted him, \u201cif you mean to inform me that I knew M. de Bornier, why of course I did, he even called upon me several times, but I could never bring myself to invite him to the house because I should always have been obliged to have it disinfected afterwards with formol. As for the dinner you mean, I remember it only too well, but it was certainly not at Z\u00e9na\u00efde\u2019s, who never set eyes on Bornier in her life, and would probably think if you spoke to her of the Fille de Roland that you meant a Bonaparte Princess who was said at one time to be engaged to the son of the King of Greece; no, it was at the Austrian Embassy. Dear Hoyos imagined he was giving me a great treat by planting on the chair next to mine that pestiferous academician. I quite thought I had a squadron of mounted police sitting beside me. I was obliged to stop my nose as best I could, all through dinner; until the gruy\u00e8re came round I didn\u2019t dare to breathe.\u201d M. de Guermantes, whose secret object was attained, made a furtive examination of his guests\u2019 faces to judge the effect of the Duchess\u2019s pleasantry. \u201cYou were speaking of correspondence; I must say, I thought Gambetta\u2019s admirable,\u201d she went on, to shew that she was not afraid to be found taking an interest in a proletarian and a radical. M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, who fully appreciated the brilliance of this feat of daring, gazed round him with an eye at once flashing and affectionate, after which he wiped his monocle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGad, it\u2019s infernally dull that Fille de Roland,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, with the satisfaction which he derived from the sense of his own superiority to a work which had bored him so, perhaps also from the suave mari magno feeling one has in the middle of a good dinner, when one recalls so terrible an evening in the past. \u201cStill, there were some quite good lines in it, and a patriotic sentiment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I let it be understood that I had no admiration for M. de Bornier. \u201cIndeed! You have some fault to find with him?\u201d the Duke asked with a note of curiosity, for he always imagined when anyone spoke ill of a man that it must be on account of a personal resentment, just as to speak well of a woman marked the beginning of a love-affair. \u201cI see you\u2019ve got your knife into him. What did he do to you? You must tell us. Why yes, there must be some skeleton in the cupboard or you wouldn\u2019t run him down. It\u2019s long-winded, the Fille de Roland, but it\u2019s quite strong in parts.\u201d \u201cStrong is just the right word for an author who smelt like that,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes broke in sarcastically. \u201cIf this poor boy ever found himself face to face with him, I can quite understand that he carried away an impression in his nostrils!\u201d \u201cI must confess, though, to Ma\u2019am,\u201d the Duke went on, addressing the Princesse de Parme, \u201cthat quite apart from theFille de Roland, in literature and even in music I am terribly old-fashioned; no old nightingale can be too stale for my taste. You won\u2019t believe me, perhaps, but in the evenings, if my wife sits down to the piano, I find myself calling for some old tune by Auber or Boieldieu, or even Beethoven! That\u2019s the sort of thing that appeals to me. As for Wagner, he sends me to sleep at once.\u201d \u201cYou are wrong there,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cin spite of his insufferable long-windedness, Wagner was a genius. Lohengrin is a masterpiece. Even in Tristan there are some amusing passages scattered about. And the Chorus of Spinners in the Flying Dutchman is a perfect marvel.\u201d \u201cA\u2019n\u2019t I right, Babal,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, turning to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, \u201cwhat we like is:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Les rendez-vous de noble compagnie\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Se donnent tous en ce charmant s\u00e9jour\n\nIt\u2019s delicious. And Fra Diavolo, and the Magic Flute, and the Chalet, and the Marriage of Figaro, and the Diamants de la Couronne \u2014 there\u2019s music for you! It\u2019s the same thing in literature. For instance, I adore Balzac, theBal de Sceaux, the Mohicans de Paris.\u201d \u201cOh, my dear, if you are going to begin about Balzac, we shall never hear the end of it; do wait, keep it for some evening when M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2018s here. He\u2019s even better, he knows it all by heart.\u201d Irritated by his wife\u2019s interruption, the Duke held her for some seconds under the fire of a menacing silence. And his huntsman\u2019s eyes reminded me of a brace of loaded pistols. Meanwhile Mme. d\u2019Arpajon had been exchanging with the Princesse de Parme, upon tragic and other kinds of poetry, a series of remarks which did not reach me distinctly until I caught the following from Mme. d\u2019Arpajon: \u201cOh, Ma\u2019am is sure to be right; I quite admit he makes the world seem ugly, because he\u2019s unable to distinguish between ugliness and beauty, or rather because his insufferable vanity makes him believe that everything he says is beautiful; I agree with your Highness that in the piece we are speaking of there are some ridiculous things, quite unintelligible, errors of taste, that it is difficult to understand, that it\u2019s as much trouble to read as if it was written in Russian or Chinese, for of course it\u2019s anything in the world but French, still when one has taken the trouble, how richly one is rewarded, it\u2019s so full of imagination!\u201d Of this little lecture I had missed the opening sentences. I gathered in the end not only that the poet incapable of distinguishing between beauty and ugliness was Victor Hugo, but furthermore that the poem which was as difficult to understand as Chinese or Russian was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lorsque l\u2019enfant para\u00eet, le cercle de famille\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applaudit \u00e0 grands cris\n\nA piece dating from the poet\u2019s earliest period, and perhaps even nearer to Mme. Deshouli\u00e8res than to the Victor Hugo of the L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles. Far from condemning Mme. d\u2019Arpajon as absurd, I saw her (the only one, at that table so matter-of-fact, so nondescript, at which I had sat down with such keen disappointment), I saw her in my mind\u2019s eye crowned with that lace cap, with the long spiral ringlets falling from it on either side, which was worn by Mme. de R\u00e9musat, Mme. de Broglie, Mme. de Saint-Aularie, all those distinguished women who in their fascinating letters quote with so much learning and so aptly passages from Sophocles, Schiller and theImitation, but in whom the earliest poetry of the Romantics induced the alarm and exhaustion inseparable for my grandmother from the latest verses of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. \u201cMme. d\u2019Arpajon is very fond of poetry,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme to her hostess, impressed by the ardent tone in which the speech had been delivered. \u201cNo; she knows absolutely nothing about it,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes in an undertone, taking advantage of the fact that Mme. d\u2019Arpajon, who was dealing with an objection raised by General de Beautreillis, was too much intent upon what she herself was saying to hear what was being murmured by the Duchess. \u201cShe has become literary since she\u2019s been forsaken. I can tell your Highness that it is I who have to bear the whole burden of it because it is to me that she comes in floods of tears whenever Basin hasn\u2019t been to see her, which is practically every day. And yet it isn\u2019t my fault, after all, if she bores him, and I can\u2019t force him to go to her, although I would rather he were a little more faithful to her, because then I shouldn\u2019t see quite so much of her myself. But she drives him crazy, and there\u2019s nothing extraordinary in that. She isn\u2019t a bad sort, but she\u2019s boring to a degree you can\u2019t imagine. And all this because Basin took it into his head for a year or so to play me false with her. And to have in addition a footman who has fallen in love with a little street-walker and goes about with a long face if I don\u2019t request the young person to leave her profitable pavement for half an hour and come to tea with me! Oh! Life really is too tedious!\u201d the Duchess languorously concluded. Mme. d\u2019Arpajon bored M. de Guermantes principally because he had recently fallen in love with another, whom I discovered to be the Marquise de Surgis-le-Duc. At this moment the footman who had been deprived of his holiday was waiting at table. And it struck me that, still disconsolate, he was doing it with a good deal of difficulty, for I noticed that, in handing the dish to M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault, he performed his task so awkwardly that the Duke\u2019s elbow came in contact several times with his own. The young Duke was not in the least annoyed with the blushing footman, but looked up at him rather with a smile in his clear blue eyes. This good humour seemed to me on the guest\u2019s part to betoken a kindness of heart. But the persistence of his smile led me to think that, aware of the servant\u2019s discomfiture, what he felt was perhaps really a malicious joy. \u201cBut, my dear, you know you\u2019re not revealing any new discovery when you tell us about Victor Hugo,\u201d went on the Duchess, this time addressing Mme. d\u2019Arpajon whom she had just seen turn away from the General with a troubled air. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t expect to launch that young genius. Everybody knows that he has talent. What is utterly detestable is the Victor Hugo of the last stage, the L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles, I forget all their names. But in the Feuilles d\u2019Automne, the Chants du Cr\u00e9puscule, there\u2019s a great deal that\u2019s the work of a poet, a true poet! Even in theContemplations,\u201d went on the Duchess, whom none of her listeners dared to contradict, and with good reason, \u201cthere are still some quite pretty things. But I confess that I prefer not to venture farther than theCrepuscule! And then in the finer poems of Victor Hugo, and there really are some, one frequently comes across an idea, even a profound idea.\u201d And with the right shade of sentiment, bringing out the sorrowful thought with the full strength of her intonation, planting it somewhere beyond the sound of her voice, and fixing straight in front of her a charming, dreamy gaze, the Duchess said slowly: \u201cTake this:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0La douleur est un fruit\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.Dieu ne le fait pas cro\u00eetre\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sur la branche trop faible encor pour le porter\n\nOr, better still:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Les morts durent bien peu\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0H\u00e9las, dans le cercueil ils tombent en poussi\u00e8re\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moins vite qu\u2019en nos coeurs!\u201d\n\nAnd, while a smile of disillusionment contracted with a graceful undulation her sorrowing lips, the Duchess fastened on Mme. d\u2019Arpajon the dreaming gaze of her charming, clear blue eyes. I was beginning to know them, as well as her voice, with its heavy drawl, its harsh savour. In those eyes and in that voice, I recognised much of the life of nature round Combray. Certainly, in the affectation with which that voice brought into prominence at times a rudeness of the soil there was more than one element: the wholly provincial origin of one branch of the Guermantes family, which had for long remained more localised, more hardy, wilder, more provoking than the rest; and also the usage of really distinguished people, and of witty people who know that distinction does not consist in mincing speech, and the usage of nobles who fraternise more readily with their peasants than with the middle classes; peculiarities all of which the regal position of Mme. de Guermantes enabled her to display more easily to bring out with every sail spread. It appears that the same voice existed also in certain of her sisters whom she detested, and who, less intelligent than herself and almost plebeianly married, if one may coin this adverb to speak of unions with obscure noblemen, entrenched on their provincial estates, or, in Paris, in a Faubourg Saint-Germain of no brilliance, possessed this voice also but had bridled it, corrected it, softened it so far as lay in their power, just as it is very rarely that any of us presumes on his own originality and does not apply himself diligently to copying the most approved models. But Oriane was so much more intelligent, so much richer, above all, so much more in fashion than her sisters, she had so effectively, when Princesse des Laumes, behaved just as she pleased in the company of the Prince of Wales, that she had realised that this discordant voice was an attraction, and had made of it, in the social order, with the courage of originality rewarded by success, what in the theatrical order a R\u00e9jane, a Jeanne Granier (which implies no comparison, naturally, between the respective merits and talents of those two actresses) had made of theirs, something admirable and distinctive which possibly certain R\u00e9jane and Granier sisters, whom no one has ever known, strove to conceal as a defect\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To all these reasons for displaying her local originality, the favourite writers of Mme. de Guermantes \u2014 M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy \u2014 had brought in addition, with the respect for what was natural, a feeling for the prosaic by which she attained to poetry and a spirit purely of society which called up distant landscapes before my eyes. Besides, the Duchess was fully capable, adding to these influences an artistic research of her own, of having chosen for the majority of her words the pronunciation that seemed to her most \u2018He de France,\u2019 most \u2018Champenoise,\u2019 since, if not quite to the same extent as her sister-in-law Marsantes, she rarely used anything but the pure vocabulary that might have been employed by an old French writer. And when one was tired of the composite patchwork of modern speech, it was, albeit one was aware that she expressed far fewer ideas, a thorough relaxation to listen to the talk of Mme. de Guermantes \u2014 almost the same feeling, if one was alone with her and she restrained and clarified still further her flow of words, as one has on hearing an old song. Then, as I looked at, as I listened to Mme. de Guermantes, I could see, a prisoner in the perpetual and quiet afternoon of her eyes, a sky of the He de France or of Champagne spread itself, grey-blue, oblique, with the same angle of inclination as in the eyes of Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, by these several formations, Mme. de Guermantes expressed at once the most ancient aristocratic France, then, from a far later source, the manner in which the Duchesse de Broglie might have enjoyed and found fault with Victor Hugo under the July Monarchy, and, finally, a keen taste for the literature that sprang from M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and Meilhac. The first of these formations attracted me more than the second, did more to console me for the disappointments of my pilgrimage to and arrival in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, so different from what I had imagined it to be; but even the second I preferred to the last. For, so long as Mme. de Guermantes was being, almost spontaneously, a Guermantes and nothing more, her Pailleronism, her taste for the younger Dumas were reflected and deliberate. As this taste was the opposite of my own, she was productive, to my mind, of literature when she talked to me of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and never seemed to me so stupidly Faubourg Saint-Germain as when she was talking literature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moved by this last quotation, Mme. d\u2019Arpajon exclaimed: \u201c\u2019Ces reliques du coeur ont aussi leur poussi\u00e8re!\u2019 Sir, you must write that down for me on my fan,\u201d she said to M. de Guermantes. \u201cPoor woman, I feel sorry for her!\u201d said the Princesse de Parme to Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cNo, really, Ma\u2019am, you must not be soft-hearted, she has only got what she deserves.\u201d \u201cBut \u2014 you\u2019ll forgive me for saying this to you \u2014 she does really love him all the same!\u201d \u201cOh, not at all; she isn\u2019t capable of it; she thinks she loves him just as she thought just now she was quoting Victor Hugo, when she repeated a line from Musset. Listen,\u201d the Duchess went on in a tone of melancholy, \u201cnobody would be more touched than myself by any true sentiment. But let me give you an instance. Only yesterday, she made a terrible scene with Basin. Your Highness thinks perhaps that it was because he\u2019s in love with other women, because he no longer loves her; not in the least, it was because he won\u2019t put her sons down for the Jockey. Does Ma\u2019am call that the behaviour of a woman in love? No; I will go farther;\u201d Mme. de Guermantes added with precision, \u201cshe is a person of singular insensibility.\u201d Meanwhile it was with an eye sparkling with satisfaction that M. de Guermantes had listened to his wife talking about Victor Hugo \u2018point-blank\u2019 and quoting his poetry. The Duchess might frequently annoy him; at moments like this he was proud of her. \u201cOriane is really extraordinary. She can talk about anything, she has read everything. She could not possibly have guessed that the conversation this evening would turn on Victor Hugo. Whatever subject you take up, she is ready for you, she can hold her own with the most learned scholars. This young man must be quite captivated.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo let us change the conversation,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes went on, \u201cbecause she\u2019s dreadfully susceptible. You will think me quite old-fashioned,\u201d she began, turning to me. \u201cI know that nowadays it\u2019s considered a weakness to care for ideas in poetry, poetry with some thought in it.\u201d \u201cOld-fashioned?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme, quivering with the slight thrill sent through her by this new wave which she had not expected, albeit she knew that the conversation of the Duchesse de Guermantes always held in store for her these continuous and delightful shocks, that breath-catching panic, that wholesome exhaustion after which her thoughts instinctively turned to the necessity of taking a footbath in a dressing cabin and a brisk walk to \u2018restore her circulation.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFor my part, no, Oriane,\u201d said Mme. de Brissac, \u201cI don\u2019t in the least object to Victor Hugo\u2019s having ideas, quite the contrary, but I do object to his seeking for them in sheer monstrosities. After all, it was he who accustomed us to ugliness in literature. There are quite enough ugly things already in real life. Why can\u2019t we be allowed at least to forget it while we are reading. A distressing spectacle, from which we should turn away in real life, that is what attracts Victor Hugo.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVictor Hugo is not as realistic as Zola though, surely?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme. The name of Zola did not stir a muscle on the face of M. de Beautreillis. The General\u2019s anti-Dreyfusism was too deep-rooted for him to seek to give expression to it. And his good-natured silence when anyone broached these topics moved the profane heart as a proof of the same delicacy that a priest shews in avoiding any reference to your religious duties, a financier when he takes care not to recommend your investing in the companies which he himself controls, a strong man when he behaves with lamblike gentleness and does not hit you in the jaw. \u201cI know you\u2019re related to Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re,\u201d was murmured to me with an air of connivance by Mme. de Varambon, the lady in waiting to the Princesse de Parme, an excellent but limited woman, procured for the Princess in the past by the Duke\u2019s mother. She had not previously uttered a word to me, and I could never afterwards, despite the admonitions of the Princess and my own protestations, get out of her mind the idea that I was in some way connected with the Academician Admiral, who was a complete stranger to me. The obstinate persistence of the Princesse de Parme\u2019s lady in waiting in seeing in me a nephew of Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re was in itself quite an ordinary form of silliness. But the mistake she made was only a crowning instance of all the other mistakes, less serious, more elaborate, unconscious or deliberate, which accompany one\u2019s name on the label which society writes out and attaches to one. I remember that a friend of the Guermantes who had expressed a keen desire to meet me gave me as the reason that I was a great friend of his cousin, Mme. de Chaussegros. \u201cShe is a charming person, she\u2019s so fond of you.\u201d I scrupulously, though quite vainly, insisted on the fact that there must be some mistake, as I did not know Mme. de Chaussegros. \u201cThen it\u2019s her sister you know; it comes to the same thing. She met you in Scotland.\u201d I had never been in Scotland, and took the futile precaution, in my honesty, of letting my informant know this. It was Mme. de Chaussegros herself who had said that she knew me, and no doubt sincerely believed it, as a result of some initial confusion, for from that time onwards she never failed to hold out her hand to me whenever she saw me. And as, after all, the world in which I moved was precisely that in which Mme. de Chaussegros moved my modesty had neither rhyme nor reason. To say that I was intimate with the Chaussegros was, literally, a mistake, but from the social point of view was to state an equivalent of my position, if one can speak of the social position of so young a man as I then was. It therefore mattered not in the least that this friend of the Guermantes should tell me only things that were false about myself, he neither lowered nor exalted me (from the worldly point of view) in the idea which he continued to hold of me. And when all is said, for those of us who are not professional actors the tedium of living always in the same character is removed for a moment, as if we were to go on the boards, when another person forms a false idea of us, imagines that we are friends with a lady whom we do not know and are reported to have met in the course of a delightful tour of a foreign country which we have never made. Errors that multiply themselves and are harmless when they have not the inflexible rigidity of this one which had been committed, and continued for the rest of her life to be committed, in spite of my denials, by the imbecile lady in waiting to Mme. de Parme, rooted for all time in the belief that I was related to the tiresome Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re. \u201cShe is not very strong in her head,\u201d the Duke confided to me, \u201cand besides, she ought not to indulge in too many libations. I fancy, she\u2019s slightly under the influence of Bacchus.\u201d As a matter of fact Mme. de Varambon had drunk nothing but water, but the Duke liked to find scope for his favourite figures of speech. \u201cBut Zola is not a realist, Ma\u2019am, he\u2019s a poet!\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, drawing inspiration from the critical essays which she had read in recent years and adapting them to her own personal genius. Agreeably buffeted hitherto, in the course of this bath of wit, a bath stirred for herself, which she was taking this evening and which, she considered, must be particularly good for her health, letting herself be swept away by the waves of paradox which curled and broke one after another, before this, the most enormous of them all, the Princesse de Parme jumped for fear of being knocked over. And it was in a choking voice, as though she were quite out of breath, that she now gasped: \u201cZola a poet!\u201d \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d answered the Duchess with a laugh, entranced by this display of suffocation. \u201cYour Highness must have remarked how he magnifies everything he touches. You will tell me that he touches just what \u2014 perish the thought! But he makes it into something colossal. His is the epic dungheap. He is the Homer of the sewers! He has not enough capitals to print Cambronne\u2019s word.\u201d Despite the extreme exhaustion which she was beginning to feel, the Princess was enchanted; never had she felt better. She would not have exchanged for an invitation to Schonbrunn, albeit that was the one thing that really flattered her, these divine dinner-parties at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s, made invigorating by so liberal a dose of attic salt. \u201cHe writes it with a big C,\u201d cried Mme. d\u2019Arpajon. \u201cSurely with a big M, I think, my dear,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, exchanging first with her husband a merry glance which implied: \u201cDid you ever hear such an idiot?\u201d \u201cWait a minute, now.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes turned to me, fixing on me a tender, smiling gaze, because, as an accomplished hostess, she was anxious to display her own knowledge of the artist who interested me specially, to give me, if I required it, an opportunity for exhibiting mine. \u201cWait,\u201d she urged me, gently waving her feather fan, so conscious was she at this moment that she was performing in full the duties of hospitality, and, that she might be found wanting in none of them, making a sign also to the servants to help me to more of the asparagus and mousseline sauce: \u201cwait, now, I do believe that Zola has actually written an essay on Elstir, the painter whose things you were looking at just now \u2014 the only ones of his, really, that I care for,\u201d she concluded. As a matter of fact sh hated Elstir\u2019s work, but found a unique quality in anything that was in her own house. I asked M. de Guermantes if he knew the name of the gentleman in the tall hat who figured in the picture of the crowd and whom I recognised as the same person whose portrait the Guermantes also had and had hung beside the other, both dating more or less from the same early period in which Elstir\u2019s personality was not yet completely established and he derived a certain inspiration from Manet. \u201cGood Lord, yes,\u201d he replied, \u201cI know it\u2019s a fellow who is quite well-known and no fool either in his own line, but I have no head for names. I have it on the tip of my tongue, Monsieur. . . . Monsieur. . . . oh, well, it doesn\u2019t matter, I can\u2019t remember it. Swann would be able to tell you, it was he who made Mme. de Guermantes buy all that stuff; she is always too good-natured, afraid of hurting people\u2019s feelings if she refuses to do things; between ourselves, I believe he\u2019s landed us with a lot of rubbish. What I can tell you is that the gentleman you mean has been a sort of Maecenas to M. Elstir, he started him and has often helped him out of tight places by ordering pictures from him. As a compliment to this man \u2014 if you can call that sort of thing a compliment \u2014 he has painted him standing about among that crowd, where with his Sunday-go-to-meeting look he creates a distinctly odd effect. He may be a big gun in his own way but he is evidently not aware of the proper time and place for a top hat. With that thing on his head, among all those bare-headed girls, he looks like a little country lawyer on the razzle-dazzle. But tell me, you seem quite gone on his pictures. If I had only known, I should have got up the subject properly. Not that there\u2019s any need to rack one\u2019s brains over the meaning of M. Elstir\u2019s work, as one would for Ingres\u2019s Source or the Princes in the Towier by Paul Delaroche. What one appreciates in his work is that it\u2019s shrewdly observed, amusing, Parisian, and then one passes on to the next thing. One doesn\u2019t need to be an expert to look at that sort of thing. I know of course that they\u2019re merely sketches, still, I don\u2019t feel myself that he puts enough work into them. Swann was determined that we should buy aBundle of Asparagus. In fact it was in the house for several days. There was nothing else in the picture, a bundle of asparagus exactly like what you\u2019re eating now. But I must say I declined to swallow M. Elstir\u2019s asparagus. He asked three hundred francs for them. Three hundred francs for a bundle of asparagus. A louis, that\u2019s as much as they\u2019re worth, even if they are out of season. I thought it a bit stiff. When he puts real people into his pictures as well, there\u2019s something rather caddish, something detrimental about him which does not appeal to me. I am surprised to see a delicate mind, a superior brain like yours admire that sort of thing.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why you should say that, Basin,\u201d interrupted the Duchess, who did not like to hear people run down anything that her rooms contained. \u201cI am by no means prepared to admit that there\u2019s nothing distinguished in Elstir\u2019s pictures. You have to take it or leave it. But it\u2019s not always lacking in talent. And you must admit that the ones I bought are singularly beautiful.\u201d \u201cWell, Oriane, in that style of thing I\u2019d a thousand times rather have the little study by M. Vibert we saw at the water-colour exhibition. There\u2019s nothing much in it, if you like, you could take it in the palm of your hand, but you can see the man\u2019s clever through and through: that unwashed scarecrow of a missionary standing before the sleek prelate who is making his little dog do tricks, it\u2019s a perfect little poem of subtlety, and in fact goes really deep.\u201d \u201cI believe you know M. Elstir,\u201d the Duchess went on to me, \u201cas a man, he\u2019s quite pleasant.\u201d \u201cHe is intelligent,\u201d said the Duke; \u201cone is surprised, when one talks to him, that his painting should be so vulgar.\u201d \u201cHe is more than intelligent, he is really quite clever,\u201d said the Duchess in the confidently critical tone of a person who knew what she was talking about. \u201cDidn\u2019t he once start a portrait of you, Oriane?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme. \u201cYes, in shrimp pink,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cbut that\u2019s not going to hand his name down to posterity. It\u2019s a ghastly thing; Basin wanted to have it destroyed.\u201d This last statement was one which Mme. de Guermantes often made. But at other times her appreciation of the picture was different: \u201cI do not care for his painting, but he did once do a good portrait of me.\u201d The former of these judgments was addressed as a rule to people who spoke to the Duchess of her portrait, the other to those who did not refer to it and whom therefore she was anxious to inform of its existence. The former was inspired in her by coquetry, the latter by vanity. \u201cMake a portrait of you look ghastly! Why, then it can\u2019t be a portrait, it\u2019s a falsehood; I don\u2019t know one end of a brush from the other, but I\u2019m sure if I were to paint you, merely putting you down as I see you, I should produce a masterpiece,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme ingenuously. \u201cHe sees me probably as I see myself, without any allurements,\u201d said the Duchesse de Guermantes, with the look, melancholy, modest and coaxing, which seemed to her best calculated to make her appear different from what Elstir had portrayed. \u201cThat portrait ought to appeal to Mme. de Gallardon,\u201d said the Duke. \u201cBecause she knows nothing about pictures?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme, who knew that Mme. de Guermantes had an infinite contempt for her cousin. \u201cBut she\u2019s a very good woman, isn\u2019t she?\u201d The Duke assumed an air of profound astonishment. \u201cWhy, Basin, don\u2019t you see the Princess is making fun of you?\u201d (The Princess had never dreamed of doing such a thing.) \u201cShe knows as well as you do that Gallardonette is an old poison,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes, whose vocabulary, limited as a rule to all these old expressions, was as savoury as those dishes which it is possible to come across in the delicious books of Pampille, but which have in real life become so rare, dishes where the jellies, the butter, the gravy, the quails are all genuine, permit of no alloy, where even the salt is brought specially from the salt-marshes of Brittany; from her accent, her choice of words, one felt that the basis of the Duchess\u2019s conversation came directly from Guermantes. In this way the Duchess differed profoundly from her nephew Saint-Loup, the prey of so many new ideas and expressions; it is difficult, when one\u2019s mind is troubled by the ideas of Kant and the longings of Baudelaire, to write the exquisite French of Henri IV, which meant that the very purity of the Duchess\u2019s language was a sign of limitation, and that, in her, both her intelligence and her sensibility had remained proof against all innovation. Here again, Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s mind attracted me just because of what it excluded was exactly the content of my own thoughts) and by everything which by virtue of that exclusion, it had been able to preserve, that seductive vigour of the supple bodies which no exhausting necessity to think no moral anxiety or nervous trouble has deformed. Her mind, of a formation so anterior to my own, was for me the equivalent of what had been offered me by the procession of the girls of the little band along the seashore Mme. de Guermantes offered me, domesticated and held in subjection by her natural courtesy, by the respect due to another person\u2019s intellectual worth, all the energy and charm of a cruel little girl of one of the noble families round Combray who from her childhood had been brought up in the saddle, tortured cats, gouged out the eyes of rabbits, and; albeit she had remained a pillar of virtue, might equally well have been, a good few years ago now, the most brilliant mistress of the Prince de Sagan. Only she was incapable of realising what I had sought for in her, the charm of her historic name, and the tiny quantity of it that I had found in her, a rustic survival from Guermantes. Were our relations founded upon a misunderstanding which could not fail to become manifest as soon as my homage, instead of being addressed to the relatively superior woman that she believed herself to be, should be diverted to some other woman of equal mediocrity and breathing the same unconscious charm? A misunderstanding so entirely natural, and one that will always exist between a young dreamer like myself and a woman of the world, one however that profoundly disturbs him, so long as he has not yet discovered the nature of his imaginative faculties and has not acquired his share of the inevitable disappointments which he is destined to find in people, as in the theatre, in his travels and indeed in love. M. de Guermantes having declared (following upon Elstir\u2019s asparagus and those that were brought round after the financi\u00e8re chicken) that green asparagus grown in the open air, which, as has been so quaintly said by the charming writer who signs himself E. de Clermont-Tonnerre, \u201chave not the impressive rigidity of their sisters,\u201d ought to be eaten with eggs: \u201cOne man\u2019s meat is another man\u2019s poison, as they say,\u201d replied M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. \u201cIn the province of Canton, in China, the greatest delicacy that can be set before one is a dish of ortolan\u2019s eggs completely rotten.\u201d M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, the author of an essay on the Mormons which had appeared in the Revue des Deux Mondes, moved in none but the most aristocratic circles, but among these visited only such as had a certain reputation for intellect, with the result that from his presence, were it at all regular, in a woman\u2019s house one could tell that she had a \u2018salon.\u2019 He pretended to a loathing of society, and assured each of his duchesses in turn that it was for the sake of her wit and beauty that he came to see her. They all believed him. Whenever, with death in his heart, he resigned himself to attending a big party at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s, he summoned them all to accompany him, to keep up his courage, and thus appeared only to be moving in the midst of an intimate group. So that his reputation as an intellectual might survive his worldly success, applying certain maxims of the Guermantes spirit, he would set out with ladies of fashion on long scientific expeditions at the height of the dancing season, and when a woman who was a snob, and consequently still without any definite position, began to go everywhere, he would put a savage obstinacy into his refusal to know her, to allow himself to be introduced to her. His hatred of snobs was a derivative of his snobbishness, but made the simpletons (in other words, everyone) believe that he was immune from snobbishness. \u201cBabal always knows everything,\u201d exclaimed the Duchesse de Guermantes. \u201cI think it must be charming, a country where you can be quite sure that your dairyman will supply you with really rotten eggs, eggs of the year of the comet. I can see myself dipping my bread and butter in them. I must say, you get the same thing at aunt Madeleine\u2019s\u201d (Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s) \u201cwhere everything\u2019s served in a state of putrefaction, eggs included.\u201d Then, as Mme. d\u2019Arpajon protested, \u201cBut my dear Phili, you know it as well as I do. You can see the chicken in the egg. What I can\u2019t understand is how they manage not to fall out. It\u2019s not an omelette you get there, it\u2019s a poultry-yard. You were so wise not to come to dinner there yesterday, there was a brill cooked in carbolic! I assure you, it wasn\u2019t a dinner-table, it was far more like an operating-table. Really, Norpois carries loyalty to the pitch of heroism. He actually asked for more!\u201d \u201cI believe I saw you at dinner there the time she made that attack on M. Bloch\u201d (M. de Guermantes, perhaps to give to an Israelite name a more foreign sound, pronounced the \u2018ch\u2019 in Bloch not like a \u2018k\u2019 but as in the German \u2018hoch\u2019) \u201cwhen he said about some poit\u201d (poet) \u201cor other that he was sublime. Ch\u00e2tellerault did his best to break M. Bloch\u2019s shins, the fellow didn\u2019t understand in the least and thought my nephew\u2019s kick was aimed at a young woman sitting opposite him.\u201d (At this point, M. de Guermantes coloured slightly.) \u201cHe did not realise that he was annoying our aunt by his \u2018sublimes\u2019 chucked about all over the place like that. In short, aunt Madeleine, who doesn\u2019t keep her tongue in her pocket, turned on him with: \u2018Indeed, Sir, and what epithet do you keep for M. de Bousset?\u2019\u201d (M. de Guermantes thought that, when one mentioned a famous name, the use of \u2018Monsieur\u2019 and a particle was eminently \u2018old school.\u2019) \u201cThat put him in his place, all right.\u201d \u201cAnd what answer did this M. Bloch make?\u201d came in a careless tone from Mme. de Guermantes, who, running short for the moment of original ideas, felt that she must copy her husband\u2019s teutonic pronunciation. \u201cAh! I can assure you, M. Bloch did not wait for any more, he\u2019s still running.\u201d \u201cYes, I remember quite well seeing you there that evening,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes with emphasis as though, coming from her, there must be something in this reminiscence highly flattering to myself. \u201cIt is always so interesting at my aunt\u2019s. At the last party she gave, which was, of course, when I met you, I meant to ask you whether that old gentleman who went past where we were, sitting wasn\u2019t Fran\u00e7ois Copp\u00e9e. You must know who everyone is,\u201d she went on, sincerely envious of my relations with poets and poetry, and also out of \u2018consideration\u2019 for myself, the wish to establish in a better position in the eyes of her other guests a young man so well versed in literature. I assured the Duchess that I had not observed any celebrities at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s party. \u201cWhat!\u201d she replied with a bewilderment which revealed that her respect for men of letters and her contempt for society were more superficial than she said, perhaps even than she thought, \u201cWhat! There were no famous authors there! You astonish me! Why, I saw all sorts of quite impossible people!\u201d I remembered the evening in question distinctly owing to an entirely trivial incident that had occurred at the party. Mme. de Villeparisis had introduced Bloch to Mme. Alphonse de Rothschild, but my friend had not caught the name and, thinking he was talking to an old English lady who was a trifle mad had replied only in monosyllables to the garrulous conversation of the historic beauty, when Mme. de Villeparisis in making her known to some one else uttered, quite distinctly this time: \u201cThe Baronne Alphonse de Rothschild.\u201d Thereupon there had coursed suddenly and simultaneously through Bloch\u2019s arteries so many ideas of millions and of social importance, which it would have been more prudent to subdivide and separate, that he had undergone, so to speak, a momentary failure of heart and brain alike, and cried aloud in the dear old lady\u2019s presence: \u201cIf I\u2019d only known!\u201d an exclamation the silliness of which kept him from sleeping for at least a week afterwards. His remark was of no great interest, but I remembered it as a proof that sometimes in this life, under the stress of an exceptional emotion, people do say what is in their minds. \u201cI fancy Mme. de Villeparisis is not absolutely . . . moral,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, who knew that the best people did not visit the Duchess\u2019s aunt, and, from what the Duchess herself had just been saying, that one might speak freely about her. But, Mme. de Guermantes not seeming to approve of this criticism, she hastened to add: \u201cThough, of course, intellect carried to that degree excuses everything.\u201d \u201cBut you take the same view of my aunt that everyone else does,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cwhich is, really, quite mistaken. It\u2019s just what M\u00e9m\u00e9 was saying to me only yesterday.\u201d She blushed; a reminiscence unknown to me filmed her eyes. I formed the supposition that M. de Charlus had asked her to cancel my invitation, as he had sent Robert to ask me not to go to her house. I had the impression that the blush \u2014 equally incomprehensible to me \u2014 which had tinged the Duke\u2019s cheek when he made some reference to his brother could not be attributed to the same cause. \u201cMy poor aunt \u2014 she will always have the reputation of being a lady of the old school, of sparkling wit and uncontrolled passions. And really there\u2019s no more middle-class, serious, commonplace mind in Paris. She will go down as a patron of the arts, which means to say that she was once the mistress of a great painter, though he was never able to make her understand what a picture was; and as for her private life, so far from being a depraved woman, she was so much made for marriage, so conjugal from her cradle that, not having succeeded in keeping a husband, who incidentally was a cad, she has never had a love-affair which she hasn\u2019t taken just as seriously as if it were holy matrimony, with the same susceptibilities, the same quarrels, the same fidelity. By which token, those relations are often the most sincere; you\u2019ll find, in fact, more inconsolable lovers than husbands.\u201d \u201cYet, Oriane, if you take the case of your brother-in-law Palam\u00e8de you were speaking about just now; no mistress in the world could ever dream of being mourned as that poor Mme. de Charlus has been.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cYour Highness must permit me to be not altogether of her opinion. People don\u2019t all like to be mourned in the same way, each of us has his preferences.\u201d \u201cStill, he did make a regular cult of her after her death. It is true that people sometimes do for the dead what they would not have done for the living.\u201d \u201cFor one thing,\u201d retorted Mme. de Guermantes in a dreamy tone which belied her teasing purpose, \u201cwe go to their funerals, which we never do for the living!\u201d M. de Guermantes gave a sly glance at M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 as though to provoke him into laughter at the Duchess\u2019s wit. \u201cAt the same time I frankly admit,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cthat the manner in which I should like to be mourned by a man I loved would not be that adopted by my brother-in-law.\u201d The Duke\u2019s face darkened. He did not like to hear his wife utter rash judgments, especially about M. de Charlus. \u201cYou are very particular. His grief set an example to everyone,\u201d he reproved her stiffly. But the Duchess had in dealing with her husband that sort of boldness which animal tamers shew, or people who live with a madman and are not afraid of making him angry. \u201cOh, very well, just as you like \u2014 he does set an example, I never said he didn\u2019t, he goes every day to the cemetery to tell her how many people he has had to luncheon, he misses her enormously, but \u2014 as he\u2019d mourn for a cousin, a grandmother, a sister. It is not the grief of a husband. It is true that they were a pair of saints, which makes it all rather exceptional.\u201d M. de Guermantes, infuriated by his wife\u2019s chatter, fixed on her with a terrible immobility a pair of eyes already loaded. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to say anything against poor M\u00e9m\u00e9, who, by the way, could not come this evening,\u201d went on the Duchess, \u201cI quite admit there\u2019s no one like him, he\u2019s delightful; he has a delicacy, a warmth of heart that you don\u2019t as a rule find in men. He has a woman\u2019s heart, M\u00e9m\u00e9 has!\u201d \u201cWhat you say is absurd,\u201d M. de Guermantes broke in sharply. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing effeminate about M\u00e9m\u00e9, I know nobody so manly as he is.\u201d \u201cBut I am not suggesting that he\u2019s the least bit in the world effeminate. Do at least take the trouble to understand what I say,\u201d retorted the Duchess. \u201cHe\u2019s always like that the moment anyone mentions his brother,\u201d she added, turning to the Princesse de Parme. \u201cIt\u2019s very charming, it\u2019s a pleasure to hear him. There\u2019s nothing so nice as two brothers who are fond of each other,\u201d replied the Princess, as many a humbler person might have replied, for it is possible to belong to a princely race by birth and at the same time to be mentally affiliated to a race that is thoroughly plebeian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs we\u2019re discussing your family, Oriane,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cI saw your nephew Saint-Loup yesterday; I believe he wants to ask you to do something for him.\u201d The Duc de Guermantes bent his Olympian brow. When he did not himself care to do a service, he preferred his wife not to assume the responsibility for it, knowing that it would come to the same thing in the end and that the people to whom the Duchess would be obliged to apply would put this concession down to the common account of the household, just as much as if it had been asked of them by the husband alone. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he tell me about it himself?\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cHe was here yesterday and stayed a couple of hours, and heaven only knows what a bore he managed to make himself. He would be no stupider than anyone else if he had only the sense, like many people we know, to be content with being a fool. It\u2019s his veneer of knowledge that\u2019s so terrible. He wants to preserve an open mind \u2014 open to all the things he doesn\u2019t understand. He talks to you about Morocco. It\u2019s appalling.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe can\u2019t go back there, because of Rachel,\u201d said the Prince de Foix \u201cSurely, now that they\u2019ve broken it off,\u201d interrupted M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. \u201cSo far from breaking it off, I found her a couple of days ago in Robert\u2019s rooms, they didn\u2019t look at all like people who\u2019d quarrelled, I can assure you,\u201d replied the Prince de Foix, who loved to spread abroad every rumour that could damage Robert\u2019s chances of marrying, and might for that matter have been misled by one of the intermittent resumptions of a connexion that was practically at an end\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat Rachel was speaking to me about you, I see her like that in the mornings, on the way to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es; she\u2019s a kind of head-in-air, as you say, what you call \u2018unlaced,\u2019 a sort of \u2018Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias,\u2019 only figuratively speaking, of course.\u201d This speech was addressed to me by Prince Von, who liked always to appear conversant with French literature and Parisian catchwords\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, that\u2019s just what it was \u2014 Morocco!\u201d exclaimed the Princess, flinging herself into this opening. \u201cWhat on earth can he want in Morocco?\u201d asked M. de Guermantes sternly; \u201cOriane can do absolutely nothing for him there, as he knows perfectly well.\u201d \u201cHe thinks he invented strategy,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes pursued the theme, \u201cand then he uses impossible words for the most trivial things, which doesn\u2019t prevent him from making blots all over his letters. The other day he announced that he\u2019d been given some sublime potatoes, and that he\u2019d taken a sublime stage box.\u201d \u201cHe speaks Latin,\u201d the Duke went one better. \u201cWhat! Latin?\u201d the Princesse gasped. \u201c\u2018Pon my soul he does! Ma\u2019am can ask Oriane if I\u2019m not telling the truth.\u201d \u201cWhy, of course, Ma\u2019am; the other day he said to us straight out, without stopping to think: \u2018I know of no more touching example of sic transit gloria mundi.\u2019 I can repeat the phrase now to your Highness because, after endless inquiries and by appealing to linguists, we succeeded in reconstructing it, but Robert flung it out without pausing for breath, one could hardly make out that there was Latin in it, he was just like a character in the Malade Imaginaire. And all this referred simply to the death of the Empress of Austria!\u201d \u201cPoor woman!\u201d cried the Princess, \u201cwhat a delicious creature she was.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201ca trifle mad, a trifle headstrong, but she was a thoroughly good woman, a nice, kind-hearted lunatic; the only thing I could never make out about her was why she had never managed to get her teeth made to fit her; they always came loose half-way through a sentence and she was obliged to stop short or she\u2019d have swallowed them.\u201d \u201cThat Rachel was speaking to me about you, she told me that young Saint-Loup worshipped you, that he was fonder of you than he was of her,\u201d said Prince Von to me, devouring his food like an ogre as he spoke, his face scarlet, his teeth bared by his perpetual grin. \u201cBut in that case she must be jealous of me and hate me,\u201d said I. \u201cNot at all, she told me all sorts of nice things about you. The Prince de Foix\u2019s mistress would perhaps be jealous if he preferred you to her. You don\u2019t understand? Come home with me, and I\u2019ll explain it all to you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t, I\u2019m going on to M. de Charlus at eleven.\u201d \u201cWhy, he sent round to me yesterday to ask me to dine with him this evening, but told me not to come after a quarter to eleven. But if you must go to him, at least come with me as far as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais, you will be in the periphery,\u201d said the Prince, who thought doubtless that this last word meant \u2018proximity\u2019 or possibly \u2018centre.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the bulging eyes in his coarse though handsome red face frightened me and I declined, saying that a friend was coming to call for me. This reply seemed to me in no way offensive. The Prince, however, apparently formed a different impression of it for he did not say another word to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI really must go and see the Queen of Naples; what a grief it must be to her,\u201d said (or at least appeared to me to have said) the Princesse de Parme. For her words had come to me only indistinctly through the intervening screen of those addressed to me, albeit in an undertone, by Prince Von, who had doubtless been afraid, if he spoke louder, of being overheard by the Prince de Foix. \u201cOh, dear, no!\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it has been any grief at all.\u201d \u201cNone at all! You do always fly to extremes so, Oriane,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, resuming his part of the cliff which by standing up to the wave forces it to fling higher its crest of foam. \u201cBasin knows even better than I that I\u2019m telling the truth,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cbut he thinks he\u2019s obliged to look severe because you are present, Ma\u2019am, and he\u2019s afraid of my shocking you.\u201d \u201cOh, please, no, I beg of you,\u201d cried the Princesse de Parme, dreading the slightest alteration on her account of these delicious Fridays at the Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019s, this forbidden fruit which the Queen of Sweden herself had not yet acquired the right to taste. \u201cWhy, it was Basin himself that she told, when he said to her with a duly sorrowful expression: \u2018But the Queen is in mourning; for whom, pray, is it a great grief to your Majesty?\u2019\u2014\u2018No, it\u2019s not a deep mourning, it\u2019s a light mourning, quite a light mourning, it\u2019s my sister.\u2019 The truth is, she\u2019s delighted about it, as Basin knows perfectly well, she invited us to a party that very evening, and gave me two pearls. I wish she could lose a sister every day! So far from weeping for her sister\u2019s death, she was in fits of laughter over it. She probably says to herself, like Robert, \u2018sic transit \u2014\u2014\u2019 I forget how it goes on,\u201d she added modestly, knowing how it went on perfectly well\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In saying all this Mme. de Guermantes was only being witty, and with complete insincerity, for the Queen of Naples, like the Duchesse d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, also doomed to a tragic fate, had the warmest heart in the world and mourned quite sincerely for her kinsfolk. Mme. de Guermantes knew those noble Bavarian sisters, her cousins, too well not to be aware of this. \u201cHe would like not to go back to Morocco,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, alighting hurriedly again upon the perch of Robert\u2019s name which had been held out to her, quite unintentionally, by Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cI believe you know General de Monserfeuil.\u201d \u201cVery slightly,\u201d replied the Duchess, who was an intimate friend of the officer in question. The Princess explained what it was that Saint-Loup wanted. \u201cGood gracious, yes, if I see him \u2014 it is possible that I may meet him,\u201d the Duchess replied, so as not to appear to be refusing, the occasions of her meeting General de Monserfeuil seeming to extend rapidly farther apart as soon as it became a question of her asking him for anything. This uncertainty did not, however, satisfy the Duke, who interrupted his wife: \u201cYou know perfectly well you won\u2019t seeing him, Oriane, and besides you have already asked him for two thing which he hasn\u2019t done. My wife has a passion for doing good turns to people,\u201d he went on, growing more and more furious, in order to force the Princess to withdraw her request, without there being any question made of his wife\u2019s good nature and so that Mme. de Parme should throw the blame back upon his own character, which was essentially obstructive. \u201cRobert could get anything he wanted out of Monserfeuil. Only, as he happens not to know himself what he wants, he gets us to ask for it because he knows there\u2019s no better way of making the whole thing fall through. Oriane has asked too many favours of Monserfeuil. A request from her now would be a reason for him to refuse.\u201d \u201cOh, in that case, it would be better if the Duchess did nothing,\u201d said Mme. de Parme\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cObviously!\u201d the Duke closed the discussion. \u201cPoor General, he\u2019s been defeated again at the elections,\u201d said the Princess, so as to turn the conversation from Robert. \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing serious, it\u2019s only the seventh time,\u201d said the Duke, who, having been obliged himself to retire from politics, quite enjoyed hearing of other people\u2019s failures at the polls. \u201cHe has consoled himself by giving his wife another baby.\u201d \u201cWhat! Is that poor Mme. de Monserfeuil in an interesting condition again?\u201d cried the Princess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d replied the Duke, \u201cthat\u2019s the one division where the poor General has never failed to get in.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the period that followed I was continually to be invited, were it with a small party only, to these repasts at which I had at one time imagined the guests as seated like the Apostles in the Sainte-Chapelle. They did assemble there indeed, like the early Christians, not to partake merely of a material nourishment, which incidentally was exquisite, but in a sort of social Eucharist; so that in the course of a few dinner-parties I assimilated the acquaintance of all the friends of my hosts, friends to whom they presented me with a shade of benevolent patronage so marked (as a person for whom they had always had a sort of parental affection) that there was not one among them who would not have felt himself to be failing in his duty to the Duke and Duchess if he had given a ball without including my name on his list, and at the same time, while I sipped one of those Yquems which lay concealed in the Guermantes cellars, I tasted ortolans dressed according to each of the different recipes which the Duke himself used to elaborate and modified with prudence. However, for one who had already set his knees more than once beneath the mystic board, the consumption of the latter was not indispensable. Old friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes came in to see them after dinner, \u2018with the tooth-picks,\u2019 as Mme. Swann would have said, without being expected, and took in winter a cup of tilleul in the lighted warmth of the great drawing-room, in summer a glass of orangeade in the darkness of the little rectangular strip of garden outside. There was no record of anything else, among the Guermantes, in these evenings in the garden, but orangeade. It had a sort of ritual meaning. To have added other refreshments would have seemed to be falsifying the tradition, just as a big at-home in the Faubourg Saint-Germain ceases to be an at-home if there is a play also, or music. You must be supposed to have come simply \u2014 though there be five hundred of you \u2014 to pay a call on, let us say, the Princesse de Guermantes. People marvelled at my influence because I was able to procure the addition to this orangeade of a jug containing the juice of stewed cherries or stewed pears. I took a dislike on this account to the Prince d\u2019Agrigente, who was like all the people who, lacking in imagination but not in covetousness, take a keen interest in what one is drinking and ask if they may taste a little of it themselves. Which meant that, every time, M. d\u2019Agrigente, by diminishing my ration, spoiled my pleasure. For this fruit juice can never be provided in sufficient quantities to quench one\u2019s thirst for it. Nothing is less cloying than these transpositions into flavour of the colour of a fruit which when cooked seems to have travelled backwards to the past season of its blossoming. Blushing like an orchard in spring, or, it may be, colourless and cool like the zephyr beneath the fruit-trees, the juice lets itself be breathed and gazed into one drop by drop, and M. d\u2019Agrigente prevented me, regularly, from taking my fill of it. Despite these distillations the traditional orangeade persisted like the tilleul. In these humble kinds, the social communion was none the less administered. In this respect, doubtless, the friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes had, after all, as I had originally imagined, remained more different from the rest of humanity than their outward appearance might have misled me into supposing. Numbers of elderly men came to receive from the Duchess, together with the invariable drink, a welcome that was often far from cordial. Now this could not have been due to snobbishness, they themselves being of a rank to which there was none superior; nor to love of splendour; they did love it perhaps, but on less stringent social conditions might have been enjoying a glittering example of it, for on these same evenings the charming wife of a colossally rich financier would have given anything in the world to have them among the brilliant shooting-party she was giving for a couple of days for the King of Spain. They had nevertheless declined her invitation, and had come round without fail to inquire whether Mme. de Guermantes was at home. They were not even certain of finding there opinions that conformed entirely with their own, or sentiments of any great warmth; Mme. de Guermantes let fall now and then, on the Dreyfus case, on the Republic, the Laws against Religion, or even in an undertone on themselves, their weaknesses, the dullness of their conversation, comments which they had to appear not to notice. No doubt, if they kept up their habit of coming there, it was owing to their superfine training as epicures in things worldly, to their clear consciousness of the prime and perfect quality of the social dish, with its familiar, reassuring, sappy savour, free from blend or taint, with the origin and history of which they were as well aware as she who served them with it, remaining more \u2018noble\u2019 in this respect than they themselves imagined. Now, on this occasion, among the visitors to whom I was introduced after dinner, it so happened that there was that General de Monserfeuil of whom the Princesse de Parme had been speaking, while Mme. de Guermantes, of whose drawing-room he was one of the regular frequenters, had not known that he was going to be there that evening. He bowed before me, on hearing my name, as though I had been the President of the Supreme War Council. I had supposed it to be simply from some deep-rooted unwillingness to oblige, in which the Duke, as in wit if not in love, was his wife\u2019s accomplice, that the Duchess had practically refused to recommend her nephew to M. de Monserfeuil. And I saw in this an indifference all the more blameworthy in that I seemed to have gathered from a few words let fall by the Princess that Robert was in a post of danger from which it would be prudent to have him removed. But it was by the genuine malice of Mme. de Guermantes that I was revolted when, the Princesse de Parme having timidly suggested that she might say something herself and on her own responsibility to the General, the Duchess did everything in her power to dissuade her. \u201cBut Ma\u2019am,\u201d she cried, \u201cMonserfeuil has no sort of standing or influence whatever with the new Government. You would be wasting your breath.\u201d \u201cI think he can hear us,\u201d murmured the Princess, as a hint to the Duchess not to speak so loud. Without lowering her voice: \u201cYour Highness need not be afraid, he\u2019s as deaf as a post,\u201d said the Duchess, every word reaching the General distinctly. \u201cThe thing is, I believe M. de Saint-Loup is in a place that is not very safe,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cWhat is one to do?\u201d replied the Duchess. \u201cHe\u2019s in the same boat as everybody else, the only difference being that it was he who originally asked to be sent there. Besides, no, it\u2019s not really dangerous; if it was, you can imagine how anxious I should be to help. I, should have spoken to Saint-Joseph about it during dinner. He has far more influence, and he\u2019s a real worker. But, as you see, he\u2019s gone now. Still, asking him would be less awkward than going to this one, who has; three of his sons in Morocco just now and has refused to apply for them to be exchanged; he might raise that as an objection. Since your Highness insists on it, I shall speak to Saint-Joseph \u2014 if I see him again, or to Beautreillis. But if I don\u2019t see either of them, you mustn\u2019t waste your pity on Robert. It was explained to us the other day exactly where he is. I\u2019m sure he couldn\u2019t wish for a better place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a pretty flower, I\u2019ve never seen one like it; there\u2019s no one like you, Oriane, for having such marvellous things in your house,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, who, fearing that General de Monserfeuil might have overheard the Duchess, sought now to change the conversation. I looked and recognised a plant of the sort that I had watched Elstir painting. \u201cI am so glad you like them; they are charming, do look at their little purple velvet collars; the only thing against them is \u2014 as may happen with people who are very pretty and very nicely dressed \u2014 they have a hideous name and a horrid smell. In spite of which I am very fond of them. But what is rather sad is that they are dying.\u201d \u201cBut they\u2019re growing in a pot, they aren\u2019t cut flowers,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cNo,\u201d answered the Duchess with a smile, \u201cbut it comes to the same thing, as they\u2019re all ladies. It\u2019s a kind of plant where the ladies and the gentlemen don\u2019t both grow on the same stalk. I\u2019m like people who keep a lady dog. I have to find a husband for my flowers. Otherwise I shan\u2019t have any young ones!\u201d \u201cHow very strange. Do you mean to say that in nature . . .?\u201d \u201cYes! There are certain insects whose duty it is to bring about the marriage, as they do with Sovereigns, by proxy, without the bride and bridegroom ever having set eyes on one another. And so, I assure you, I always tell my man to put my plant out in the window as often as possible, on the courtyard side and the garden side turn about, in the hope that the necessary insect will arrive. But the odds are too great. Fancy, he has first to have been seen by a person of the same species and the opposite sex, and he must then have taken it into his head to come and leave cards at the house. He hasn\u2019t appeared so far, I believe my plant can still qualify for the white flower of a blameless life, but I must say a little immodesty would please me better. It\u2019s just the same with that fine tree we have in the courtyard; he will die childless because he belongs to a kind that\u2019s very rare in these latitudes. In his case, it\u2019s the wind that\u2019s responsible for consummating the marriage, but the wall is a trifle high.\u201d \u201cBy Jove, yes,\u201d said M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, \u201cyou ought to take just a couple of inches off the top, that will be quite enough. There are certain operations one ought to know how to perform. The flavour of vanilla we tasted in the excellent ice you gave us this evening, Duchess, comes from a plant called the vanilla tree. This plant produces flowers which are both male and female, but a sort of solid wall set up between them prevents any communication. And so we could never get any fruit from them until a young Negro, a native of R\u00e9union, by the name of Albins, which by the way is rather an odd name for a black man since it means \u2018white,\u2019 had the happy thought of using the point of a needle to bring the separate organs into contact.\u201d \u201cBabal, you\u2019re divine, you know everything,\u201d cried the Duchess. \u201cBut you yourself, Oriane, have told me things I had no idea of,\u201d the Princesse de Parme assured her. \u201cI must explain to your Highness that it is Swann who has always talked to me all about botany. Sometimes when we were too bored to go to a tea-party or a concert we would set off for the country, and he would shew me extraordinary marriages between flowers, which was far more amusing than going to human marriages \u2014 no wedding-breakfast and no crowd in the sacristy. We never had time to go very far. Now that motor-cars have come in, it Would be delightful. Unfortunately, in the interval he himself has made an even more astonishing marriage, which makes everything very difficult. Oh, Ma\u2019am, life is a dreadful business, we spend our whole time doing things that bore us, and when by mere chance we come across somebody with whom we could go and look at something really interesting, he has to make a marriage like Swann\u2019s. Faced with the alternatives of giving up my botanical expeditions and being obliged to call upon a degrading person, I chose the former calamity. Besides, when it comes to that, there was no need to go quite so far. It seems that here, in my own little bit of garden, more odd things happen in broad daylight than at midnight \u2014 in the Bois de Boulogne! Only they attract no attention, because among flowers it\u2019s all done quite simply, you see a little orange shower, or else a very dusty fly coming to wipe its feet or take a bath before crawling into a flower. And that does the trick!\u201d \u201cThe cabinet the plant is standing on is splendid, too; it\u2019s Empire, I think,\u201d said the Princess, who, not being familiar with the works of Darwin and his followers, was unable to grasp the point of the Duchess\u2019s pleasantries. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m so glad Ma\u2019am likes it,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cit\u2019s a magnificent piece. I must tell you that I\u2019ve always adored the Empire style, even when it wasn\u2019t in fashion. I remember at Guermantes I got into terrible disgrace with my mother-in-law because I told them to bring down from the attics all the splendid Empire furniture Basin had inherited from the Montesquious, and used it to furnish the wing we lived in.\u201d M. de Guermantes smiled. He must nevertheless have remembered that the course of events had been totally different. But, the witticisms of the Princesse des Laumes at the expense of her mother-in-law\u2019s bad taste having been a tradition during the short time in which the Prince was in love with his wife, his love for the latter had been outlasted by a certain contempt for the intellectual inferiority of the former, a contempt which, however, went hand in hand with a considerable attachment and respect. \u201cThe I\u00e9nas have the same armchair with Wedgwood medallions, it\u2019s a lovely thing, but I prefer my own;\u201d said the Duchess, with the same air of impartiality as if she had been the possessor of neither of the articles under discussion. \u201cI know, of course, that they\u2019ve some marvellous things which I haven\u2019t got.\u201d The Princesse de Parme remained silent. \u201cBut it\u2019s quite true; your Highness hasn\u2019t seen their collection. Oh, you ought really to come there one day with me, it\u2019s one of the most magnificent things in Paris. You\u2019d say it was a museum come to life.\u201d And since this suggestion was one of the most \u2018Guermantes\u2019 of the Duchess\u2019s audacities, inasmuch as the l\u00e9nas were for the Princesse de Parme rank usurpers, their son bearing like her own the title of Duc de Guastalla, Mme. de Guermantes in thus launching it could not refrain (so far did the love that she bore for her own originality prevail over the deference due to the Princesse de Parme) from casting at her other guests a smiling glance of amusement. They too made an effort to smile, at once frightened, bewildered, and above all delighted to think that they were being ear-witnesses of Oriane\u2019s very \u2018latest\u2019 and could carry it away with them \u2018red hot.\u2019 They were only half shocked, knowing that the Duchess had the knack of strewing the ground with all the Courvoisier prejudices to achieve a vital success more thrilling and more enjoyable. Had she not, within the last few years, brought together Princesse Mathilde and that Due d\u2019Aumale who had written to the Princess\u2019s own brother the famous letter: \u201cIn my family all the men are brave and the women chaste\u201d? And inasmuch as Princes remain princely even at those moments when they appear anxious to forget that they are, the Due d\u2019Aumale and Princesse Mathilde had enjoyed themselves so greatly at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s that they had thereafter formed a defensive alliance, with that faculty for forgetting the past which Louis XVIII shewed when he took as his Minister Fouch\u00e9, who had voted the death of his brother. Mme. de Guermantes was now nourishing a similar project of arranging a meeting between Princesse Mur\u00e2t and the Queen of Naples. In the meantime, the Princesse de Parme appeared as embarrassed as might have been the heirs-apparent to the Thrones of the Netherlands and Belgium, styled respectively Prince of Orange and Duke of Brabant, had one offered to present to them M. de Mailly Nesle, Prince d\u2019Orange, and M. de Charlus, Due de Brabant. But, before anything further could happen, the Duchess, whom Swann and M. de Charlus between them (albeit the latter was resolute in ignoring the l\u00e9nas\u2019 existence) had with great difficulty succeeded in making admire the Empire style, exclaimed: \u201cHonestly, Ma\u2019am, I can\u2019t tell you how beautiful you will think it! I must confess that the Empire style has always had a fascination for me. But at the l\u00e9nas\u2019 it is really like a hallucination. That sort of \u2014 what shall I say \u2014 reflux from the Expedition to Egypt, and also the sweep forward into our own times from Antiquity, all those things that invade our houses, the Sphinxes that come to crouch at the feet of the sofas, the serpents coiled round candelabra, a huge Muse who holds out a little torch for you to play at bouillotte, or has quietly climbed on to the mantelpiece and is leaning against your clock; and then all the Pompeian lamps, the little boat-shaped beds which look as if they had been found floating on the Nile so that you expect to see Moses climb out of them, the classical chariots galloping along the bed tables. . . . \u201d \u201cThey\u2019re not very comfortable to sit in, those Empire chairs,\u201d the Princess ventured. \u201cNo,\u201d the Duchess agreed, \u201cbut,\u201d she at once added, insisting on the point with a smile: \u201cI like being uncomfortable on those mahogany seats covered with ruby velvet or green silk. I like that discomfort of the warrior who understands nothing but the curule chair and in the middle of his principal drawing-room crosses his fasces and piles his laurels. I can assure you that at the I\u00e9nas\u2019 one doesn\u2019t stop to think for a moment of how comfortable one is, when one sees in front of one a great strapping wench of a Victory painted in fresco on the wall. My husband is going to say that I\u2019m a very bad Royalist, but I\u2019m terribly disaffected, as you know, I can assure you that in those people\u2019s house one comes to love all the big N\u2019s and all the bees. Good gracious, after all for a good many years under our Kings we weren\u2019t exactly surfeited with glory, and so these warriors who brought home so many crowns that they stuck them even on the arms of the chairs, I must say I think it\u2019s all rather fetching! Your Highness ought really.\u201d \u201cWhy, my dear, if you think so,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cbut it seems to me that it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d \u201cBut Ma\u2019am will find that it will all go quite smoothly. They are very good people, and no fools. We took Mme. de Chevreuse there,\u201d added the Duchess, knowing the force of this example, \u201cshe was enchanted. The son is really very pleasant. I\u2019m going to say something that\u2019s not quite proper,\u201d she went on, \u201cbut he has a bedroom, and more especially a bed in it, in which I should love to sleep \u2014 without him! What is even less proper is that I went to see him once when he was ill and lying in it. By his side on the frame of the bed was moulded a long Siren, stretched out at full length, a lovely thing with a mother-of-pearl tail and some sort of lotus flowers in her hand. I assure you,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes, reducing the speed of her utterances to bring into even bolder relief the words which she had the air of modelling with the pout of her fine lips, drawing them out with her long expressive hands, directing on the Princess as she spoke a gentle, steady and searching gaze, \u201cthat with the palms and the golden crown at the side, it was most moving, it was just the arrangement of Gustave Moreau\u2019s Death and the Young Man (your Highness must know that great work, of course).\u201d The Princesse de Parme, who did not know so much as the painter\u2019s name, made violent movements with her head and smiled ardently, in order to manifest her admiration for his picture. But the intensity of her mimicry could not fill the place of that light which is absent from our eyes so long as we do not understand what people are trying to tell us. \u201cA good-looking boy, I believe?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo for he\u2019s just like a tapir. The eyes are a little those of a Queen Hortense on a screen. But he has probably come to the conclusion that it is rather absurd for a man to develop such a resemblance, and it is lost in the encaustic surface of his cheeks which give him really rather a Mameluke appearance. You feel that the polisher must call round every morning. Swann,\u201d she went on, reverting to the bed of the young Duke, \u201cwas struck by the resemblance between this Siren and Gustave Moreau\u2019s Death. But apart from that,\u201d she added, her speech becoming more rapid though still serious, so as to provoke more laughter, \u201cthere was nothing really that could strike us, for it was only a cold in the head, and the young man made a marvellous recovery.\u201d \u201cThey say he\u2019s a snob?\u201d put in M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, with a malicious twinkle, expecting to be answered with the same precision as though he had said: \u201cThey tell me that he has only four fingers on his right hand; is that so?\u201d \u201cG\u2014 ood g \u2014 racious, n \u2014 o,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes with a smile of benign indulgence. \u201cPerhaps just the least little bit of a snob in appearance, because he\u2019s extremely young, but I should be surprised to hear that he was really, for he\u2019s intelligent,\u201d she added, as though there were to her mind some absolute incompatibility between snobbishness and intelligence. \u201cHe has wit, too, I\u2019ve known him to be quite amusing,\u201d she said again, laughing with the air of an epicure and expert, as though the act of declaring that a person could be amusing demanded a certain expression of merriment from the speaker, or as though the Duc de Guastalla\u2019s sallies were recurring to her mind as she spoke. \u201cAnyway, as he never goes anywhere, he can\u2019t have much field for his snobbishness,\u201d she wound up, forgetting that this was hardly encouraging the Princesse de Parme to make overtures. \u201cI cannot help wondering what the Prince de Guermantes, who calls her Mme. I\u00e9na, will say if he hears that I\u2019ve been to see her.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Duchess with extraordinary vivacity. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that it was we who gave up to Gilbert\u201d (she bitterly regretted that surrender now) \u201ca complete card-room done in the Empire style which came to us from Quiou-Quiou, and is an absolute marvel! There was no room for it here, though I think it would look better here than it does with him. It\u2019s a thing of sheer beauty, half Etruscan, half Egyptian. . . . \u201d \u201cEgyptian?\u201d queried the Princess, to whom the word Etruscan conveyed little. \u201cWell, really, you know, a little of both. Swann told us that, he explained it all to me, only you know I\u2019m such a dunce. But then, Ma\u2019am, what one has to bear in mind is that the Egypt of the Empire cabinetmakers has nothing to do with the historical Egypt, nor their Roman with the Romans nor their Etruria. . . . \u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cNo, it\u2019s like what they used to call a Louis XV costume under the Second Empire, when Anna de Monchy and dear Brigode\u2019s mother were girls. Basin was talking to you just now about Beethoven. We heard a thing of his played the other day which was really quite good, though a little stiff, with a Russian theme in it. It\u2019s pathetic to think that he believed it to be Russian. In the same way as the Chinese painters believed they were copying Bellini. Besides, even in the same country, whenever anybody begins to look at things in a way that is slightly novel, nine hundred and ninety-nine people out of a thousand are totally incapable of seeing what he puts before them. It takes at least forty years before they can manage to make it out.\u201d \u201cForty years!\u201d the Princess cried in alarm. \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d went on the Duchess, adding more and more to her words (which were practically my own, for I had just been expressing a similar idea to her), thanks to her way of pronouncing them, the equivalent of what on the printed page is called italics: \u201cit\u2019s like a sort of first isolated individual of a species which does not yet exist but is going to multiply in the future, an individual endowed with a kind of sense which the human race of his generation does not possess. I can hardly give myself as an instance because I, on the contrary, have always loved any interesting production from the very start, however novel it might be. But really, the other day I was with the Grand Duchess in the Louvre and we happened to pass before Manet\u2019s Olympia. Nowadays nobody is in the least surprised by it. It looks just like an Ingres! And yet, heaven only knows how many spears I\u2019ve had to break for that picture, which I don\u2019t altogether like but which is unquestionably the work of somebody.\u201d \u201cAnd is the Grand Duchess well?\u201d inquired the Princesse de Parme, to whom the Tsar\u2019s aunt was infinitely more familiar than Manet\u2019s model. \u201cYes; we talked about you. After all,\u201d she resumed, clinging to her idea, \u201cthe fact of the matter is, as my brother-in-law Palam\u00e8de always says, that one has between oneself and the rest of the world the barrier of a strange language. Though I admit that there\u2019s no one it\u2019s quite so true of as Gilbert. If it amuses you to go to the I\u00e9nas\u2019, you have far too much sense to let your actions be governed by what that poor fellow may think, who is a dear, innocent creature, but really lives in a different world. I feel myself nearer, more akin to my coachman, my horses even, than to a man who keeps on harking back to what people would have thought under Philip the Bold or Louis the Fat. Just fancy, when he goes for a walk in the country, he takes a stick to drive the peasants out of his way, quite in a friendly spirit, saying: \u2018Get on, clowns!\u2019 Really, I\u2019m just as much surprised when he speaks to me as if I heard myself addressed by one of the \u2018recumbents\u2019 on the old gothic tombs. It\u2019s all very well that animated gravestone\u2019s being my cousin; he frightens me, and the only idea that comes into my head is to let him stay in his Middle Ages. Apart from that, I quite admit that he\u2019s never assassinated anyone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve just been seeing him at dinner at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s,\u201d said the General, but without either smiling at or endorsing the Duchess\u2019s pleasantries. \u201cWas M. de Norpois there?\u201d asked Prince Von, whose mind still ran on the Academy of Moral Sciences. \u201cWhy, yes;\u201d said the General. \u201cIn fact, he was talking about your Emperor.\u201d \u201cIt seems, the Emperor William is highly intelligent, but he does not care for Elstir\u2019s painting. Not that I\u2019m saying this against him,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cI quite share his point of view. Although Elstir has done a fine portrait of me. You don\u2019t know it? It\u2019s not in the least like me, but it\u2019s a remarkable piece of work. He is interesting while one\u2019s sitting to him. He has made me like a little old woman It\u2019s after the style of the Regents of the Hospital, by Hals. I expect you know those sublimities, to borrow my nephew\u2019s favourite expression,\u201d the Duchess turned to myself, gently flapping her fan of black feathers. More than erect on her chair, she flung her head nobly backwards, for, while always a great lady, she was a trifle inclined to play the great lady also. I said that I had been once to Amsterdam and The Hague, but that to avoid confusing my mind, as my time was limited, I had left out Haarlem. \u201cAh! The Hague! What a gallery!\u201d cried M. de Guermantes. I said to him that he had doubtless admired Vermeer\u2019s Street in Delft. But the Duke was less erudite than arrogant. Accordingly he contented himself with replying in a tone of sufficiency, as was his habit whenever anyone spoke to him of a picture in a gallery, or in the Salon, which he did not remember having seen. \u201cIf it\u2019s to be seen, I saw it!\u201d \u201cWhat? You\u2019ve been to Holland, and you never visited Haarlem!\u201d cried the Duchess. \u201cWhy, even if you had only a quarter of an hour to spend in the place, they\u2019re an extraordinary thing to have seen, those Halses. I don\u2019t mind saying that a person who only caught a passing glimpse of them from the top of a tramway-car without stopping, supposing they were hung out to view in the street, would open his eyes pretty wide.\u201d This utterance shocked me as indicating a misconception of the way in which artistic impressions are formed in our minds, and because it seemed to imply that our eye is in that case simply a recording machine which takes instantaneous photographs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes, rejoicing that she should be speaking to me with so competent a knowledge of the subjects that interested me, gazed at the illustrious bearing of his wife, listened to what she was saying about Franz Hals, and thought: \u201cShe rides rough-shod over everything! Our young friend can go home and say that he\u2019s had before his eyes a great lady of the old school, in the full sense of the word, the like of whom couldn\u2019t be found anywhere to-day.\u201d Thus I beheld the pair of them, withdrawn from that name Guermantes in which long ago I had imagined them leading an unimaginable life, now just like other men and other women, lingering, only, behind their contemporaries a little way, and that not evenly, as in so many households of the Faubourg, where the wife has had the good taste to stop at the golden, the husband the misfortune to come down to the pinchbeck age of history, she remaining still Louis XV while her partner is pompously Louis-Philippe. That Mme. de Guermantes should be like other women had been for me at first a disappointment; it was now, by a natural reaction and with all these good wines to help, almost a miracle. A Don John of Austria, an Isabella d\u2019Est\u00e9, situated for us in the world of names, have as little communication with the great pages of history as the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way had with the Guermantes. Isabella d\u2019Est\u00e9 was no doubt in reality a very minor Princess, similar to those who under Louis XIV obtained no special place at Court. But seeming to us to be of a unique and therefore incomparable essence, we cannot conceive of her as being any less in greatness, so that a supper-party with Louis XIV would appear to us only to be rather interesting, whereas with Isabella d\u2019Este we should find ourselves, were we to meet her, gazing with our own eyes on a supernatural heroine of romance. Well, after we have, in studying Isabella d\u2019Est\u00e9, in transplanting her patiently from this world of fairyland into that of history, established the fact that her life, her thought contained nothing of that mysterious strangeness which had been suggested to us by her name, once this disappointment is complete we feel a boundless gratitude to this Princess for having had, of Mantegna\u2019s paintings, a knowledge almost equal to that, hitherto despised by us and put, as Fran\u00e7oise would have said, lower than the dirt, of M. Lafenestre. After having scaled the inaccessible heights of the name Guermantes, on descending the inner slope of the life of the Duchess, I felt on finding there the names, familiar elsewhere, of Victor Hugo, Franz Hals and, I regret to say, Vibert, the same astonishment that an explorer, after having taken into account, to imagine the singularity of the native customs in some wild valley of Central America or Northern Africa, its geographical remoteness, the strangeness of its flora, feels on discovering, once he has made his way through a hedge of giant aloes or manchineels, inhabitants who (sometimes indeed among the ruins of a Roman theatre and beneath a column dedicated to Venus) are engaged in reading M\u00e9rope or Alzire. And similarly, so remote, so distinct from, so far superior to the educated women of the middle classes whom I had known, the similar culture by which Mme. de Guermantes had made herself, with no ulterior motive, to gratify no ambition, descend to the level of people whom she would never know, had the character \u2014 meritorious, almost touching by virtue of being wholly useless \u2014 of an erudition in Phoenician antiquities in a politician or a doctor. \u201cI might have shewn you a very fine one,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, still speaking of Hals, \u201cthe finest in existence, some people say, which was left to me by a German cousin. Unfortunately, it turned out to be \u2018enfeoffed\u2019 in the castle \u2014 you don\u2019t know the expression, nor I either,\u201d she added, with her fondness for making jokes (which made her, she thought, seem modern) at the expense of the old customs to which nevertheless she was unconsciously but keenly attached. \u201cI am glad you have seen my Elstirs, but, I must admit, I should have been a great deal more glad if I could have done you the honours of my Hals, this \u2018enfeoffed\u2019 picture.\u201d \u201cI know the one,\u201d said Prince Von, \u201cit\u2019s the Grand Duke of Hesse\u2019s Hals.\u201d \u201cQuite so; his brother married my sister,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, \u201cand his mother and Oriane\u2019s were first cousins as well.\u201d \u201cBut so far as M. Elstir is concerned,\u201d the Prince went on, \u201cI shall take the liberty of saying, without having any opinion of his work, which I do not know, that the hatred with which the Emperor pursues him ought not, it seems to me, to be counted against him. The Emperor is a man of marvellous intelligence.\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019ve met him at dinner twice, once at my aunt Sagan\u2019s and once at my aunt Radziwill\u2019s, and I must say I found him quite unusual. I didn\u2019t find him at all simple! But there is something amusing about him, something \u2018forced,\u2019\u201d she detached the word, \u201clike a green carnation, that is to say a thing that surprises me and docs not please me enormously, a thing it is surprising that anyone should have been able to create but which I feel would have been just as well uncreated. I trust I\u2019m not shocking you.\u201d \u201cThe Emperor is a man of astounding intelligence,\u201d resumed the Prince, \u201che is passionately fond of the arts he has for works of art a taste that is practically infallible, if a thing is good he spots it at once and takes a dislike to it. If he detests anything there can be no more doubt about it, the thing is excellent.\u201cEveryone smiled. \u201cYou set my mind at rest,\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cI should be inclined to compare the Emperor,\u201d went on the Prince, who, not knowing how to pronounce the word archaeologist (that is to say, as though it were spelt \u2018arkeologist\u2019), never missed an opportunity of using it, \u201cto an old archaeologist\u201d (but the Prince said \u2018arsheologist\u2019) \u201cwe have in Berlin. If you put him in front of a genuine Assyrian antique, he weeps. But if it is a modern sham, if it is not really old, he does not weep. And so, when they want to know whether an arsheological piece is really old, they take it to the old arsheologist. If he weeps, they buy the piece for the Museum. If his eyes remain dry, they send it back to the dealer, and prosecute him for fraud. Well, every time I dine at Potsdam, if the Emperor says to me, of a play: \u2018Prince, you must see that, it\u2019s a work of genius,\u2019 I make a note not to go to it; and when I hear him fulminating against an exhibition, I rush to see it at the first possible opportunity.\u201d \u201cNorpois is in favour of an Anglo-French understanding, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said M. de Guermantes. \u201cWhat use would that be to you?\u201d asked Prince Von, who could not endure the English, in a tone at once of irritation and cunning. \u201cThe English are so schtubid. I know, of course, that it would not be as soldiers that they would help you. But one can judge them, all the same, by the stupidity of their Generals. A friend of mine was talking the other day to Botha, you know, the Boer leader. He said to my friend: \u2018It\u2019s terrible, an army like that. I rather like the English, as a matter of fact, but just imagine that I, who am only a peasant, have beaten them in every battle. And in the last, when I gave way before a force twenty times the strength of my own, while I myself surrendered, because I had to, I managed to take two thousand prisoners! That was good enough, because I was only commanding an army of farmers, but if those poor fools ever have to stand up against a European army, one trembles to think what may happen to them!\u2019 Besides, you have only to see how their King, whom you know as well as I do, passes for a great man in England.\u201d I barely listened to these stories, stories of the kind that M. de Norpois used to tell my father; they supplied no food for my favourite train of thought; and besides, even had they possessed the elements which they lacked, they would have had to be of a very exciting quality for my inner life to awaken during those hours in which I dwelt in my skin, my well-brushed hair, my starched shirt-front, in which, that is to say, I could feel nothing of what constituted for me the pleasure of life. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t agree with you at all,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, who felt that the German Prince was wanting in tact, \u201cI find King Edward charming, so simple, and much cleverer than people think. And the Queen is, even now, the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen in the world.\u201d \u201cBut, Madame la Duchesse,\u201d said the Prince, who was losing his temper and did not see that he was giving offence, \u201cyou must admit that if the Prince of Wales had been an ordinary person there isn\u2019t a club that wouldn\u2019t have blackballed him, and nobody would have been willing to shake hands with him. The Queen is charming, exceedingly sweet and limited. But after all there is something shocking about a royal couple who are literally kept by their subjects, who get the big Jewish financiers to foot all the bills they ought to pay themselves, and create them Baronets in return. It\u2019s like the Prince of Bulgaria . . . \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s our cousin,\u201d put in the Duchess. \u201cHe\u2019s a clever fellow.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s mine, too, but we don\u2019t think him a good fellow on that account. No, it is us you ought to make friends with, it\u2019s the Emperor\u2019s dearest wish, but he insists on its coming from the heart. He says: \u2018What I want to see is a hand clasped in mine, not waving a hat in the air.\u2019 With that, you would be invincible. It would be more practical than the Anglo-French friendship M. de Norpois preaches.\u201d \u201cYou know him, of course,\u201d the Duchess said, turning to me, so as not to leave me out of the conversation. Remembering that M. de Norpois had said that I had once looked as though I wanted to kiss his hand, thinking that he had no doubt repeated this story to Mme. de Guermantes, and in any event could have spoken of me to her only with malice, since in spite of his friendship with my father he had not hesitated to make me appear so ridiculous, I did not do what a man of the world would have done. He would have said that he detested M. de Norpois, and had let him see it; he would have said this so as to give himself the appearance of being the deliberate cause of the Ambassador\u2019s slanders, which would then have been no more than lying and calculated reprisals. I said, on the other hand, that, to my great regret, I was afraid that M. de Norpois did not like me. \u201cYou are quite mistaken,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201che likes you very much indeed. You can ask Basin, for if people give me the reputation of only saying nice things, he certainly doesn\u2019t. He will tell you that we have never heard Norpois speak about anyone so kindly as he spoke to us of you. And only the other day he was wanting to give you a fine post at the Ministry. As he knew that you were not very strong and couldn\u2019t accept it, he had the delicacy not to speak of his kind thought to your father, for whom he has an unbounded admiration.\u201d M. de Norpois was quite the last person whom I should have expected to do me any practical service. The truth was that, his being a mocking and indeed somewhat malicious spirit, those people who had let themselves be taken in as I had by his outward appearance of a Saint Louis delivering justice beneath an oak-tree, by the sounds, easily modulated to pity, that emerged from his somewhat too tuneful lips, believed in a deliberate betrayal when they learned of a slander uttered at their expense by a man who had always seemed to put his whole heart into his speech. These slanders were frequent enough with him. But that did not prevent him from feeling attractions, from praising the people he liked and taking pleasure in shewing that he could be of use to them. \u201cNot that I\u2019m in the least surprised at his appreciating you,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, \u201che\u2019s an intelligent man. And I can quite understand,\u201d she added, for the benefit of the rest of the party, making allusion to a purpose of marriage of which I had heard nothing, \u201cthat my aunt, who has long ceased to amuse him as an old mistress, may not seem of very much use to him as a young wife. Especially as I understand that even as a mistress she has ceased for years now to serve any practical purpose, she is more wrapped up in her devotions than anv thing else. Boaz-Norpois can say, in the words of Victor Hugo:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Voil\u00e0 longtemps que celle avec qui j\u2019ai dormi\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O Seigneur, a quitt\u00e9 ma couche pour la v\u00f4tre!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Really, my poor aunt is like the artists of the advanced guard who have stood out all their lives against the Academy, and in the end start a little academy of their own, or the unfrocked priests who get up a little private religion. They should either keep their frocks, or not stick to their profession. And who knows,\u201d went on the Duchess with a meditative air, \u201cit may be in preparation for her widowhood, there\u2019s nothing sadder than the weeds one\u2019s not entitled to wear.\u201d \u201cAh! If Mme. de Villeparisis were to become Mme. de Norpois, I really believe our cousin Gilbert would take to his bed,\u201d said General de Monserfeuil. \u201cThe Prince de Guermantes is a charming man, but he is, really, very much taken up with questions of birth and manners,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme. \u201cI went down to spend a few days with them in the country, when the Princess, unfortunately, was ill in bed. I was accompanied by Petite.\u201d (This was a nickname that was given to Mme. d\u2019Hunolstein because she was enormously stout.) \u201cThe Prince came to meet me at the foot of the steps, and pretended not to see Petite. We went up to the first floor, to the door into the reception rooms, and then, stepping back to make way for me, he said: \u2018Oh, how d\u2019ye do, Mme. d\u2019Hunolstein?\u2019 (he always calls her that now, since her separation) pretending to have caught sight of Petite for the first time, so as to shew her that he had not come down to receive her at the foot of the steps.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least. I don\u2019t need to tell you,\u201d said the Duke, who regarded himself as extremely modern, more contemptuous than anyone in the world of mere birth, and in fact a Republican, \u201cthat I have not many ideas in common with my cousin. Ma\u2019am can imagine that we are just about as much agreed on most subjects as day and night. But I must say that if my aunt were to marry Norpois, for once I should be of Gilbert\u2019s opinion. To be the daughter of Florimond de Guise, and then to make a marriage like that would be enough, as the saying is, to make a cat laugh; what more can I say?\u201d These last words, which the Duke uttered as a rule in the middle of a sentence, were here quite superfluous. But he felt a perpetual need to be saying them which made him postpone them to the end of a speech if he had found no place for them elsewhere. They were for him, among other things, almost a question of prosody. \u201cRemember, though,\u201d he added, \u201cthat the Norpois are gallant gentlemen with a good place, of a good stock.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen to me, Basin, it\u2019s really not worth your while to poke fun at Gilbert if you\u2019re going to speak the same language as he does,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, for whom the \u2018goodness\u2019 of a family, no less than that of a wine, consisted in its age. But, less frank than her cousin and more subtle than her husband, she made a point of never in her conversation playing false to the Guermantes spirit, and despised rank in her speech while ready to honour it by her actions. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you some sort of cousins?\u201d asked General de Monserfeuil. \u201cI seem to remember that Norpois married a La Rochefoucauld.\u201d \u201cNot in that way at all, she belonged to the branch of the Ducs de La Rochefoucauld, my grandmother came from the Ducs de Doudeauville. She was own grandmother to Edouard Coco, the wisest man in the family,\u201d replied the Duke, whose views of wisdom were somewhat superficial, \u201cand the two branches haven\u2019t intermarried since Louis XIV\u2019s time; the connexion would be rather distant.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, that\u2019s interesting; I never knew that,\u201d said the General. \u201cHowever,\u201d went on M. de Guermantes, \u201chis mother, I believe, was the sister of the Duc de Montmorency, and had originally been married to a La Tour d\u2019Auvergne. But as those Montmorencys are barely Montmorencys, while those La Tour d\u2019Auvergnes are not La Tour d\u2019Auvergnes at all, I cannot see that it gives him any very great position. He says \u2014 and this should be more to the point \u2014 that he\u2019s descended from Saintrailles, and as we ourselves are in a direct line of descent. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was at Combray a Rue de Saintrailles, to which I had never given another thought. It led from the Rue de la Bretonnerie to the Rue de l\u2019Oiseau. And as Saintrailles, the companion of Joan of Arc, had, by marrying a Guermantes, brought into that family the County of Combray, his arms were quartered with those of Guermantes at the foot of one of the windows in Saint-Hilaire. I saw again a vision of dark sandstone steps, while a modulation of sound brought to my ears that name, Guermantes, in the forgotten tone in which I used to hear it long ago, so different from that in which it was used to signify the genial hosts with whom I was dining this evening. If the name, Duchesse de Guermantes, was for me a collective name, it was so not merely in history, by the accumulation of all the women who had successively borne it, but also in the course of my own short life, which had already seen, in this single Duchesse de Guermantes, so many different women superimpose themselves, each one vanishing as soon as the next had acquired sufficient consistency. Words do not change their meaning as much in centuries as names do for us in the space of a few years. Our memory and our heart are not large enough to be able to remain faithful. We have not room enough, in our mental field, to keep the dead there as well as the living. We are obliged to build over what has gone before and is brought to light only by a chance excavation, such as the name Saintrailles had just wrought in my mind. I felt that it would be useless to explain all this, and indeed a little while earlier I had lied by implication in not answering when M. de Guermantes said to me: \u201cYou don\u2019t know our old wheedler?\u201d Perhaps he was quite well aware that I did know him, and it was only from good breeding that he did not press the question\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes drew me out of my meditation. \u201cReally, I find all that sort of thing too deadly. Listen, it\u2019s not always as boring as this at my parties. I hope that you will soon come and dine again as a compensation, with no pedigrees next time,\u201d she murmured, incapable both of appreciating the kind of charm which I could find in her house and of having sufficient humility to be content to appeal to me only as a herbarium, filled with plants of another day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What Mme. de Guermantes believed to be disappointing my expectations was on the contrary what in the end \u2014 for the Duke and the General went on to discuss pedigrees now without stopping \u2014 saved my evening from becoming a complete disappointment. How could I have felt otherwise until now? Each of my fellow-guests at dinner, smothering the mysterious name under which I had only at a distance known and dreamed of them with a body and with a mind similar or inferior to those of all the people I knew, had given me the impression of flat vulgarity which the view on entering the Danish port of Elsinore would give to any passionate admirer of Hamlet. No doubt those geographical regions and that ancient past which put forest glades and gothic belfries into their names had in a certain measure formed their faces, their intellects and their prejudices, but survived in them only as does the cause in the effect, that is to say as a thing possible for the brain to extract but in no way perceptible to the imagination\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And these old-time prejudices restored in a flash to the friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes their vanished poetry. Assuredly, the motions in the possession of nobles, which make of them the scholars, the etymologists of the language not of words but of names (and this, moreover, relatively only to the ignorant mass of the middle classes, for if at the same level of mediocrity a devout Catholic would be better able to stand questioning upon the details of the Liturgy than a free-thinker, on the other hand an anti-clerical archaeologist can often give points to his parish priest on everything connected even with the latter\u2019s own church), those notions, if we are going to confine ourselves to the truth, that is to say to the spirit, had not for these great gentlemen the charm that they would have had for a man of simple birth. They knew perhaps better than myself that the Duchesse de Guise was Princess of Cleves, of Orleans and of Porcien, and all the rest, but they had known, long before they knew all these names, the face of the Duchesse de Guise which thenceforward the names reflected back to them. I had begun with the fairy \u2014 were she fated shortly to perish \u2014 they with the woman\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In middle-class families one sometimes sees jealousies spring up if the younger sister is married before the elder. So the aristocratic world, Courvoisiers especially but Guermantes also, reduced its ennobled greatness to simple domestic superiorities, by a system of child\u2019s-play which I had me\u2019 originally (and this gave it for me its sole charm) in books. Is it not just as though Tallemant des R\u00e9aux were speaking of the Guermantes, and not of the Rohans, when he relates with evident satisfaction how M. de Gu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e9e cried to his brother: \u201cYou can come in here; this is not the Louvre!\u201d and said of the Chevalier de Rohan (because he was a natural son of the Duc de Clermont): \u201cAt any rate, he\u2019s a Prince.\u201d The only thing that distressed me in all this talk was to find that the absurd stories which were being circulated about the charming Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg found as much credence in this drawing-room as they had among Saint-Loup\u2019s friends. Plainly it was an epidemic that would not last longer than perhaps a year or two but had meanwhile infected everyone. People repeated the same old stories, or enriched them with others equally untrue. I gathered that the Princesse de Luxembourg herself, while apparently defending her nephew, supplied weapons for the assault. \u201cYou are wrong to stand up for him,\u201d M. de Guermantes told me, as Saint-Loup had told me before. \u201cWhy, without taking into consideration the opinion of our family, who are unanimous about him, you have only to talk to his servants, and they, after all, are the people who know him best. M. de Luxembourg gave his little Negro page to his nephew. The Negro came back in tears: \u2018Grand Duke beaten me; me no bad boy; Grand Duke naughty man,\u2019 it\u2019s really too much. And I can speak with some knowledge, he\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin.\u201d I cannot, by the way, say how many times in the course of this evening I heard the word \u2018cousin\u2019 used. On the one hand, M. de Guermantes, almost at every name that was mentioned, exclaimed: \u201cBut he\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin!\u201d with the sudden joy of a man who, lost in a forest, reads at the ends of a pair of arrows pointing in opposite directions on a metal plate, and followed by quite a low number of kilometres, the words: \u201cBelv\u00e9d\u00e8re Casimir-Perier\u201d and \u201cCroix du Grand-Veneur,\u201d and gathers from them that he is on the right road. On the other hand the word cousin was employed in a wholly different connexion (which was here the exception to the prevailing rule) by the Turkish Ambassadress, who had come in after dinner. Devoured by social ambition and endowed with a real power of assimilating knowledge, she would pick up with equal facility the story of the Retreat of the Ten Thousand or the details of sexual perversion among birds. It would have been impossible to \u2018stump\u2019 her on any of the most recent German publications, whether they dealt with political economy, mental aberrations, the various forms of onanism, or the philosophy of Epicurus. She was, incidentally, a dangerous person to listen to, for, perpetually in error, she would point out to you as being of the loosest morals women of irreproachable virtue, would put you on your guard against a gentleman whose intentions were perfectly honourable, and would tell you anecdotes of the sort that seem always to have come out of a book, not so much because they are serious as because they are so wildly improbable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was at this period little received in society. She had been going for some weeks now to the houses of women of real social brilliance, such as the Duchesse de Guermantes, but as a general rule had confined herself, of necessity, in the noblest families, to obscure scions whom the Guermantes had ceased to know. She hoped to give herself a really fashionable air by quoting the most historic names of the little-known people who were her friends. At once M. de Guermantes, thinking that she was referring to people who frequently dined at his table, quivered with joy at finding himself once more in sight of a landmark and shouted the rallying-cry: \u201cBut he\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin! I know him as well as I know my own name. He lives in the Rue Vaneau. His mother was Mlle. d\u2019Uz\u00e9s.\u201d The Ambassadress was obliged to admit that her specimen had been drawn from smaller game. She tried to connect her friends with those of M. de Guermantes by cutting across his track: \u201cI know quite well who\u2019 you mean. No, it\u2019s not those ones, they\u2019re cousins.\u201d But this cross-current launched by the unfortunate Ambassadress ran but a little way. For M. de Guermantes, losing interest, answered: \u201cOh, then I don\u2019t know who\u2019 you\u2019re talking about.\u201d The Ambassadress offered no reply, for if she never knew anyone nearer than the \u2018cousins\u2019 of those whom she ought to have known in person, very often these \u2018cousins\u2019 were not even related at all. Then from the lips of M. de Guermantes, would flow a fresh wave of \u201cBut she\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin!\u201d words which seemed to have for the Duke the same practical value as certain epithets, convenient to the Roman poets because they provided them with dactyls or spondees for their hexameters. At least the explosion of: \u201cBut she\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin!\u201d appeared to me quite natural when applied to the Princesse de Guermantes, who was indeed very closely related to the Duchess. The Ambassadress did not seem to care for this Princess. She said to me in an undertone: \u201cShe is stupid. No, she is not so beautiful as all that. That claim is usurped. Anyhow,\u201d she went on, with an air at once reflective, rejecting and decided, \u201cI find her most uncongenial.\u201d But often the cousinship extended a great deal further than this, Mme. de Guermantes making it a point of honour to address as \u2018Aunt\u2019 ladies with whom it would have been impossible to find her an ancestress in common without going back at least to Louis XV; just as, whenever the \u2018hardness\u2019 of the times brought it about that a multimillionairess married a prince whose great-great-grandfather had espoused, as had Oriane\u2019s also, a daughter of Louvois, one of the chief joys of the fair American was to be able, after a first visit to the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes, where she was, incidentally, more or less coldly received and hotly cross-examined, to say \u2018Aunt\u2019 to Mme. de Guermantes, who allowed her to do so with a maternal smile. But little did it concern me what birth meant for M. de Guermantes and M. de Monserfeuil; in the conversations which they held on the subject I sought only for a poetic pleasure. Without being conscious of it themselves, they procured me this pleasure as might a couple of labourers or sailors speaking of the soil or the tides, realities too little detached from their own lives for them to be capable of enjoying the beauty which personally I proceeded to extract from them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes rather than of a race it was of a particular fact, of a date that a name reminded me. Hearing M. de Guermantes recall that M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9\u2018s mother had been a Choiseul and his grandmother a Lucinge, I fancied I could see beneath the commonplace shirt with its plain pearl studs, bleeding still in two globes of crystal, those august relics, the hearts of Mme. de Praslin and of the Duc de Berri. Others were more voluptuous: the fine and flowing hair of Mme. de Tallien or Mme. de Sabran\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Better informed than his wife as to what their ancestors had been, M. de Guermantes found himself the possessor of memories which gave to his conversation a fine air of an ancient mansion stripped of its real treasures but still full of pictures, authentic, indifferent and majestic, which taken as a whole look remarkably well. The Prince d\u2019Agrigente having asked why Prince Von had said, in speaking of the Due d\u2019Aumale, \u2018my uncle,\u2019 M. de Guermantes had replied: \u201cBecause his mother\u2019s brother, the Duke of Wurttemberg, married a daughter of Louis-Philippe.\u201d At once I was lost in contemplation of a casket, such as Carpaccio or Memling used to paint, from its first panel in which the Princess, at the wedding festivities of her brother the Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, appeared wearing a plain garden dress to indicate her resentment at having seen the return, empty-handed, of the ambassadors who had been sent to sue on her behalf for the hand of the Prince of Syracuse, down to the last, in which she had just given birth to a son, the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg (the first cousin of the Prince whom I had met at dinner), in that castle called Fantaisie, one of those places which are as aristocratic as certain families. They, moreover, outlasting a single generation of men, see attached to themselves more than one historical personage. In this one, especially, survive side by side memories of the Margravine of Bayreuth, of this other somewhat fantastic Princess (the Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans\u2019s sister), to whom it was said that the name of her husband\u2019s castle made a distinct appeal, of the King of Bavaria, and finally of Prince Von, to whom it was simply his own postal address, at which he had just asked the Duc de Guermantes to write to him, for he had succeeded to it, and let it only during the Wagner festivals, to the Prince de Polignac, another delightful \u2018fantasist.\u2019 When M. de Guermantes, to explain how he was related to Mme. d\u2019Arpajon, was obliged, going so far and so simply, to climb the chain formed by the joined hands of three or five ancestresses back to Marie-Louise or Colbert, it was still the same thing in each case; a great historical event appeared only in passing, masked, unnatural, reduced, in the name of a property, in the Christian names of a woman, so selected because she was the granddaughter of Louis-Philippe and Marie-Am\u00e9lie, considered no longer as King and Queen of the French, but merely in the extent to which in their capacity as grandparents they bequeathed a heritage. (We see for other reasons in a gazetteer of the works of Balzac, where the most illustrious personages figure only according to their connexion with the Com\u00e9die Humaine, Napoleon occupy a space considerably less than that allotted to Rastignac, and occupy that space solely because he once spoke to the young ladies of Cinq-Cygne.) Similarly the aristocracy, in its heavy structure, pierced with rare windows, admitting a scanty daylight, shewing the same incapacity to soar but also the same massive and blind force as the architecture of the romanesque age, embodies all our history, immures it, beetles over it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus the empty spaces of my memory were covered by degrees with names which in taking order, in composing themselves with relation to one another, in linking themselves to one another by an increasingly numerous connexion, resembled those finished works of art in which there is not one touch that is isolated, in which every part in turn receives from the rest a justification which it confers on them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Luxembourg\u2019s name having come up again in the course of the conversation, the Turkish Ambassadress told us how, the young bride\u2019s grandfather (he who had made that immense fortune out of flour and cereals) having invited M. de Luxembourg to luncheon, the latter had written to decline, putting on the envelope: \u201cM. So-and-So, Miller,\u201d to which the grandfather had replied: \u201cI am all the more disappointed that you were not able to come, my dear friend, because I should have been able to enjoy your society quite intimately, for we were quite an intimate party, just ourselves, and there would have been only the Miller, his Son, and you.\u201d This story was not merely utterly distasteful to me, who knew the impossibility of my dear M. de Nassau\u2019s writing to the grandfather of his wife (whose fortune, moreover, he was expecting to inherit) and addressing him as \u2018Miller\u2019; but furthermore its stupidity became glaring from the start, the word \u2018Miller\u2019 having obviously been dragged in only to lead up to the title of La Fontaine\u2019s fable. But there is in the Faubourg Saint-Germain a silliness so great, when it is aggravated by malice, that they decided that the letter had been sent and that the grandfather, as to whom at once everyone confidently declared that he was a remarkable man, had shewn a prettier wit than his grandson-in-law. The Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault tried to take advantage of this story to tell the one that I had heard in the caf\u00e9: \u201cEveryone had to lie down!\u201d\u2014 but scarcely had he begun, or reported M. de Luxembourg\u2019s pretension that in his wife\u2019s presence M. de Guermantes ought to stand up, when the Duchess stopped him with the protest: \u201cNo, he is very absurd, but not as bad as that.\u201d I was privately convinced that all these stories at the expense of M. de Luxembourg were equally untrue, and that whenever I found myself face to face with any of th reputed actors or spectators I should hear the same contradiction. I asked myself, nevertheless, whether the contradiction just uttered by Mme. de Guermantes had been inspired by regard for truth or by self-esteem. In either event the latter quality succumbed to malice, for she went on, with a laugh: \u201cNot that I haven\u2019t had my little fling at him too, for he invited me to luncheon, wishing to make me know the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, which is how he has the good taste to describe his wife when he\u2019s writing to his aunt. I sent a reply expressing my regret, and adding: As for the \u2018Grand Duchess of Luxembourg\u2019 (in inverted commas), tell her that if she is coming to see me I am at home every Thursday after five. I have even had another little fling. Happening to be at Luxembourg, I telephoned, asking him to ring me up. His Highness was going to luncheon, had just risen from luncheon, two hours went by and nothing happened; so then I employed another method: \u2018Will you tell the Comte de Nassau to come and speak to me?\u2019 Cut to the quick, he was at the instrument that very minute.\u201d Everyone laughed at the Duchess\u2019s story, and at other analogous, that is to say (I am convinced of it) equally untrue stories, for a man more intelligent, better, more refined, in a word more exquisite than this Luxembourg-Nassau I have never met. The sequel will shew that it was I who was in the right. I must admit that, in the midst of her onslaught, Mme. de Guermantes had still a kind word for him. \u201cHe was not always like that,\u201d she informed us. \u201cBefore he went off his head, like the man in the story-book who thinks he\u2019s become king, he was no fool, and indeed in the early days of his engagement he used to speak of it in really quite a nice way, as something he could never have dreamed of: \u2018It\u2019s just like a fairy-tale; I shall have to make my entry into Luxembourg in a fairy coach,\u2019 he said to his uncle d\u2019Ornessan, who answered \u2014 for you know it\u2019s not a very big place, Luxembourg: \u2018A fairy coach! I\u2019m afraid, my dear fellow, you\u2019d never get it in. I should suggest that you take a goat carriage.\u2019 Not only did this not annoy Nassau, but he was the first to tell us the story, and to laugh at it.\u201d \u201cOrnessan is a witty fellow, and he\u2019s every rea \u2014 son to be; his mother was a Montjeu. lie\u2019s in a very bad way now, poor Ornessan.\u201d This name had the magic virtue of interrupting the flow of stale witticisms which otherwise would have gone on for ever. In fact, M. de Guermantes had to explain that M. d\u2019Ornessan\u2019s great-grandmother had been the sister of Marie de Castille Montjeu, the wife of Timol\u00e9on de Lorraine, and consequently Oriane\u2019s aunt, with the result that the conversation drifted back to genealogies, while the idiot of a Turkish Ambassadress breathed in my ear: \u201cYou appear to be very much in the Duke\u2019s good books; have a care!\u201d and, on my demanding an explanation: \u201cI mean to say, you understand what I mean, he\u2019s a man to whom one could safely entrust one\u2019s daughter, but not one\u2019s son.\u201d Now if ever, on the contrary, a man existed who was passionately and exclusively a lover of women, it was certainly the Duc de Guermantes. The state of error, the falsehood fatuously believed to be the truth, were for the Ambassadress like a vital element out of which she could not move. \u201cHis brother M\u00e9m\u00e9, who is, as it happens, for other reasons altogether\u201d (he did not bow to her) \u201cprofoundly uncongenial to me, is genuinely distressed by the Duke\u2019s morals. So is their aunt Villeparisis. Ah, now, her I adore! There is a saint of a woman for you, the true type of the great ladies of the past. It\u2019s not only her actual virtue that\u2019s so wonderful but her restraint. She still says \u2018Monsieur\u2019 to the Ambassador Norpois whom she sees every day, and who, by the way, left an excellent impression behind him in Turkey.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not even reply to the Ambassadress, in order to listen to the genealogies. They were not all of them important. There came up indeed in the course of the conversation one of those unexpected alliances, which, M. de Guermantes informed me, was a misalliance, but not without charm, for, uniting under the July Monarchy the Duc de Guermantes and the Duc de Fezensac with the two irresistible daughters of an eminent navigator, it gave the two Duchesses the exciting novelty of a grace exotically middle-class, \u2018Louisphilippically\u2019 Indian. Or else, under Louis XIV, a Norpois had married the daughter of the Duc de Mortenart, whose illustrious title struck, in the remoteness of that epoch, the name \u2014 which I had found colourless and might have supposed to be modern \u2014 of Norpois, carving deeply upon it the beauty of an old medal. And in these cases, moreover, it was not only the less well-known name that benefited by the association; the other, grown commonplace by the fact of its lustre, struck me more forcibly in this novel and more obscure aspect, just as among the portraits painted by a brilliant colourist the most striking is sometimes one that is all in black. The sudden mobility with which all these names seemed to me to have been endowed, as they sprang to take their places by the side of others from which I should have supposed them to be remote, was due not to my ignorance alone; the country-dances which they were performing in my mind they had carried out no less spontaneously at those epochs in which a title, being always attached to a piece of land, used to follow it from one family to another, so much so that, for example, in the fine feudal structure that is the title of Duc de Nemours or Duc de Chevreuse, I was able to discover successively hidden, as in the hospitable abode of a hermit-crab, a Guise, a Prince of Savoy, an Orl\u00e9ans, a Luynes. Sometimes several remained in competition for a single shell: for the Principality of Orange the Royal House of the Netherlands and MM. de Mailly-Nesle for the Duchy of Brabant the Baron de Charlus and the Royal House of Belgium, various others for the titles of Prince of Naples, Duke of Parma Duke of Reggio. Sometimes it was the other way; the shell had been so\u2019 long uninhabited by proprietors long since dead that it had never occurred to me that this or that name of a country house could have been, at an epoch which after all was comparatively recent, the name of a family. And so, when M. de Guermantes replied to a question put to him by M. de Monserfeuil: \u201cNo, my cousin was a fanatical Royalist; she was the daughter of the Marquis de F\u00e9terne, who played a certain part in the Chouan rising,\u201d on seeing this name F\u00e9terne, which had been for me, since my stay at Balbec, the name of a country house, become, what I had never dreamed that it could possibly be, a family name, I felt the same astonishment as in reading a fairy-tale, where turrets and a terrace come to life and turn into men and women. In this sense of the words, we may say that history, even mere family history, gives life to the old stones of a house. There have been in Parisian society men who played as considerable a part in it, who were more sought after for their distinction or for their wit, who were equally well born as the Duc de Guermantes or the Duc de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle. They have now fallen into oblivion because, as they left no descendants, their name which we no longer hear sounds like a name unknown; at most, the name of a thing beneath which we never think to discover the name of any person, it survives in some country house, some remote village. The day is not distant when the traveller who, in the heart of Burgundy, stops in the little village of Charlus to look at its church, if he has not sufficient industry or is in too great a hurry to examine its tombstones, will go away ignorant that this name, Charlus, was that of a man who ranked with the highest in the land. This thought reminded me that it was time to go, and that while I was listening to M. de Guermantes talking pedigrees, the hour was approaching at which I had promised to call upon his brother. \u201cWho knows,\u201d I continued to muse, \u201cwhether one day Guermantes itself may not appear nothing more than a place-name, save to the archaeologists who, stopping by chance at Combray and standing beneath the window of Gilbert the Bad, have the patience to listen to the account given them by Theodore\u2019s successor or to read the Cure\u2019s guide?\u201d But so long as a great name is not extinct it keeps in the full light of day those men and women who bear it; and there can be no doubt that, to a certain extent, the interest which the illustriousness of these families gave them in my eyes lay in the fact that one can, starting from to-day, follow their ascending course, step by step, to a point far beyond the fourteenth century, recover the diaries and correspondence of all the forebears of M. de Charlus, of the Prince d\u2019Agrigente, of the Princesse de Parme, in a past in which an impenetrable night would cloak the origins of a middle-class family, and in which we make out, in the luminous backward projection of a name, the origin and persistence of certain nervous characteristics, certain vices, the disorders of one or another Guermantes. Almost identical pathologically with their namesakes of the present day, they excite from century to century the startled interest of their correspondents, whether these be anterior to the Princess Palatine and Mme. de Motteville, or subsequent to the Prince de Ligne\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, my historical curiosity was faint in comparison with my aesthetic pleasure. The names cited had the effect of disincarnating the Duchess\u2019s guests, whom, for all they might call themselves Prince d\u2019Agrigente or de Cystira, their mask of flesh and of a common intelligence or want of intelligence had transformed into ordinary mortals, so much so that I had made my landing on the ducal door-mat not as upon the threshold (as I had supposed) but as at the farthest confines of the enchanted world of names. The Prince d\u2019Agrigente himself, as soon as I heard that his mother had been a Damas, a granddaughter of the Duke of Modena, was delivered, as from an unstable chemical alloy, from the face and speech that prevented one from recognising him, and went to form with Damas and Modena, which themselves were only titles, a combination infinitely more seductive. Each name displaced by the attractions of another, with which I had never suspected it of having any affinity, left the unalterable position which it had occupied in my brain, where familiarity had dulled it, and, speeding to join the Mortemarts, the Stuarts or the Bourbons, traced with them branches of the most graceful design and an ever-changing colour. The name Guermantes itself received from all the beautiful names \u2014 extinct, and so all the more glowingly rekindled \u2014 with which I learned only now that it was connected, a new sense and purpose, purely poetical. At the most, at the extremity of each spray that burgeoned from the exalted stem, I could see it flower in some face of a wise king or illustrious princess, like the sire of Henri IV or the Duchesse de Longueville. But as these faces, different in this respect from those of the party around me, were not discoloured for me by any trace of physical experience or fashionable mediocrity, they remained, in their handsome outlines and rainbow iridescence, homogeneous with those names which at regular intervals, each of a different hue, detached themselves from the genealogical tree of Guermantes, and disturbed with no foreign or opaque matter the buds \u2014 pellucid, alternate, many-coloured \u2014 which (like, in the old Jesse windows, the ancestors of Jesus) blossomed on either side of the tree of glass\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Already I had made several attempts to slip away, on account, more than for any other reason, of the triviality which my presence at it imparted to the gathering, albeit it was one of those which I had long imagined as being so beautiful \u2014 as it would doubtless have been had there been no inconvenient witness present. At least my departure would permit the other guests, once the profane intruder was no longer among them, to constitute themselves at length into a secret conclave. They would be free to celebrate the mysteries for the celebration of which they had met together, for it could obviously not have been to talk of Franz Hals or of avarice, and to talk of them in the same way as people talk in middle-class society. They uttered nothing but trivialities, doubtless because I was in the room, and I felt with some compunction, on seeing all these pretty women kept apart, that I was preventing them by my presence from carrying on, in the most precious of its drawing-rooms, the mysterious life of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. But this departure which I was trying at every moment to effect, M. and Mme. de Guermantes carried the spirit of self-sacrifice so far as to postpone, by keeping me in the room. A more curious thing still, several of the ladies who had come hurrying, delighted, beautifully dressed, with constellations of jewels, to be present at a party which, through my fault only, differed in no essential point from those that are given elsewhere than in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, any more than one feels oneself at Balbec to be in a town that differs from what one\u2019s eyes are accustomed to see \u2014 several of these ladies retired not at all disappointed, as they had every reason to be, but thanking Mme. de Guermantes most effusively for the delightful evening which they had spent, as though on the other days, those on which I was not present, nothing more used to occur\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it really for the sake of dinners such as this that all these people dressed themselves up and refused to allow the penetration of middle-class women into their so exclusive drawing-rooms \u2014 for dinners such as this? The same, had I been absent? The suspicion flashed across my mind for a moment, but it was too absurd. Plain commonsense enabled me to brush it aside. And then, if I had adopted it, what would have been left of the name Guermantes, already so degraded since Combray?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It struck me that these flower-maidens were, to a strange extent, either ready to be pleased with another person or anxious to make that person pleased with them, for more than one of them, to whom I had not uttered, during the whole course of the evening, more than two or three casual remarks, the stupidity of which had left me blushing, made a point, before leaving the drawing-room, of coming to tell me, fastening on me her fine caressing eyes, straightening as she spoke the garland of orchids that followed the curve of her bosom, what an intense pleasure it had been to her to make my acquaintance, and to speak to me \u2014 a veiled allusion to an invitation to dinner \u2014 of her desire to \u2018arrange something\u2019 after she had \u2018fixed a day\u2019 with Mme. de Guermantes. None of these flower ladies left the room before the Princesse de Parme. The presence of that lady \u2014 one must never depart before Royalty \u2014 was one of the two reasons, neither of which I had guessed, for which the Duchess had insisted so strongly on my remaining. As soon as Mme. de Parme had risen, it was like a deliverance. Each of the ladies having made a genuflexion before the Princess, who raised her up from the ground, they received from her, in a kiss, and like a benediction which they had craved kneeling, the permission to ask for their cloaks and carriages. With the result that there followed, at the front door, a sort of stentorian recital of great names from the History of France. The Princesse de Parme had forbidden Mme. de Guermantes to accompany her downstairs to the hall for fear of her catching cold, and the Duke had added: \u201cThere, Oriane, since Ma\u2019am gives you leave, remember what the doctor told you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am sure the Princesse de Parme was most pleased to take dinner with you.\u201d I knew the formula. The Duke had come the whole way across the drawing-room in order to utter it before me with an obliging, concerned air, as though he were handing me a diploma or offering me a plateful of biscuits. And I guessed from the pleasure which he appeared to be feeling as he spoke, and which brought so sweet an expression momentarily into his face, that the effort which this represented for him was of the kind which he would continue to make to the very end of his life, like one of those honorific and easy posts which, even when paralytic, one is still allowed to retain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as I was about to leave, the lady in waiting reappeared in the drawing-room, having forgotten to take away some wonderful carnations, sent up from Guermantes, which the Duchess had presented to Mme. de Parme. The lady in waiting was somewhat flushed, one felt that she had just been receiving a scolding, for the Princess, so kind to everyone else, could not contain her impatience at the stupidity of her attendant. And so the latter picked up the flowers and ran quickly, but to preserve her air of ease and independence flung at me as she passed: \u201cThe Princess says I\u2019m keeping her waiting; she wants to be gone, and to have the carnations as well. Good lord! I\u2019m not a little bird, I can\u2019t be in two places at once.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas! the rule of not leaving before Royalty was not the only one. I could not depart at once, for there was another: this was that the famous lavishness, unknown to the Courvoisiers, with which the Guermantes, whether opulent or practically ruined, excelled in entertaining their friends, was not only a material lavishness, of the kind that I had often experienced with Robert de Saint-Loup, but also a lavish display of charming words, of courteous actions, a whole system of verbal elegance supplied from a positive treasure-house within. But as this last, in the inactivity of fashionable existence, must remain unemployed, it expanded at times, sought an outlet in a sort of fugitive effusion, all the more intense, which might, in Mme. de Guermantes, have led one to suppose a genuine affection for oneself. Which she did, for that matter, feel at the moment when she let it overflow, for she found then in the society of the friend, man or woman, with whom she happened to be a sort of intoxication, in no way sensual, similar to that which music produces in certain people; she would suddenly detach a flower from her bodice, or a medallion, and present it to someone with whom she would have liked to prolong the evening, with a melancholy feeling the while that such a prolongation could have led to nothing but idle talk, into which nothing could have passed of the nervous pleasure, the fleeting emotion, similar to the first warm days of spring in the impression they leave behind them of exhaustion and regret. As for the friend, it did not do for him to put too implicit a faith in the promises, more exhilarating than anything he had ever heard, tendered by these women who, because they feel with so much more force the sweetness of a moment, make of it, with a delicacy, a nobility of which normally constituted creatures are incapable, a compelling masterpiece of grace and goodness, and have no longer anything of themselves left to give when the next moment has arrived. Their affection does not outlive the exaltation that has dictated it; and the subtlety of mind which had then led them to divine all the things that you wished to hear and to say them to you will permit them just as easily, a few days later, to seize hold of your absurdities and use them to entertain another of their visitors with whom they will then be in the act of enjoying one of those \u2018musical moments\u2019 which are so brief\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the hall where I asked a footman for my snowboots which I had brought as a precaution against the snow, several flakes of which had already fallen, to be converted rapidly into slush, not having realised that they were hardly fashionable, I felt, at the contemptuous smile on all sides, a shame which rose to its highest pitch when I saw that Mme. de Parme had not gone and was watching me put on my American \u2018rubbers.\u2019 The Princess came towards me. \u201cOh! What a good idea,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cit\u2019s so practical! There\u2019s a sensible man for you. Madame, we shall have to get a pair of those,\u201d she went on to her lady in waiting, while the mockery of the footmen turned to respect and the other guests crowded round me to inquire where I had managed to find these marvels. \u201cWith those on, you will have nothing to fear even if it starts snowing again and you have a long way to go. You\u2019re independent of the weather,\u201d said the Princess to me. \u201cOh! If it comes to that, your Royal Highness can be reassured,\u201d broke in the lady in waiting with a knowing air, \u201cit will not snow again.\u201d \u201cWhat do you know about it, Madame?\u201d came witheringly from the excellent Princesse de Parme, who alone could succeed in piercing the thick skin of her lady in waiting. \u201cI can assure your Royal Highness, it cannot snow again. It is a physical impossibility.\u201d \u201cBut why?\u201d \u201cIt cannot snow any more, they have taken the necessary steps to prevent it, they have put down salt in the streets!\u201d The simple-minded lady did not observe either the anger of the Princess or the mirth of the rest of her audience, for instead of remaining silent she said to me with a genial smile, paying no heed to my repeated denials of any connexion with Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re: \u201cNot that it matters, after all. This gentleman must have stout sea-legs. What\u2019s bred in the bone!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, having escorted the Princesse de Parme to her carriage, M. de Guermantes said to me, taking hold of my greatcoat: \u201cLet me help you into your skin.\u201d He had ceased even to smile when he employed this expression, for those that were most vulgar had for that very reason, because of the Guermantes affectation of simplicity, become aristocratic\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An exaltation that sank only into melancholy, because it was artificial, was what I also, although quite differently from Mme. de Guermantes, felt once I had finally left her house, in the carriage that was taking me to that of M. de Charlus. We can at pleasure abandon ourselves to one or other of two forces of which one rises in ourselves, emanates from our deepest impressions, the other comes to us from without. The first carries with it naturally a joy, the joy that springs from the life of the creator. The other current, that which endeavours to introduce into us the movement by which persons external to ourselves are stirred, is not accompanied by pleasure; but we can add a pleasure to it, by the shock of reaction, in an intoxication so feigned that it turns swiftly into boredom, into melancholy, whence the gloomy faces of so many men of fashion, and all those nervous conditions which may make them end in suicide. Well, in the carriage which was taking me to M. de Charlus, I was a prey to this second sort of exaltation, widely different from that which is given us by a personal impression, such as I had received in other carriages, once at Combray, in Dr. Percepied\u2019s gig, from which I had seen painted against the setting sun the spires of Martinville, another day at Balbec, in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s barouche, when I strove to identify the reminiscence that was suggested to me by an avenue of trees. But in this third carriage, what I had before my mind\u2019s eye were those conversations that had seemed to me so tedious at Mme. de Guermante\u2019s dinner-table, for example Prince Von\u2019s stories about the German Emperor, General Botha and the British Army. I had slipped them into the frame of the internal stereoscope through the lenses of which, once we are no longer ourselves, once, endowed with the spirit of society, we no longer wish to receive our life save from other people, we cast into relief what they have said and done. Like a tipsy man filled with tender feeling for the waiter who has been serving him, I marvelled at my good fortune, a good fortune not realised by me, it is true, at the actual moment, in having dined with a person who knew William II so well, and had told stories about him that were \u2014 upon my word \u2014 really witty. And, as I repeated to myself, with the Prince\u2019s German accent, the story of General Botha, I laughed out loud, as though this laugh, like certain kinds of applause which increase one\u2019s inward admiration, were necessary to the story as a corroboration of its comic element. Through the magnifying lenses even those of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s pronouncements which had struck me as being stupid (as for example that on the Hals pictures which one ought to see from the top of a tramway-car) took on a life, a depth that were extraordinary. And I must say that, even if this exaltation was quick to subside, it was not altogether unreasonable. Just as there may always come a day when we are glad to know the person whom we despise more than anyone in the world because he happens to be connected with a girl with whom we are in love, to whom he can introduce us, and thus offers us both utility and gratification, attributes in each of which we should have supposed him to be entirely lacking, so there is no conversation, any more than there are personal relations, from which we can be certain that we shall not one day derive some benefit. What Mme. de Guermantes had said to me about the pictures which it would be interesting to see, even from a tramway-car, was untrue, but it contained a germ of truth which was of value to me later on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly the lines of Victor Hugo which I had heard her quote were, it must be admitted, of a period earlier than that in which he became something more than a new man, in which he brought to light, in the order of evolution, a literary species till then unknown, endowed with more complex organs than any then in existence. In these first poems, Victor Hugo is still a thinker, instead of contenting himself, like Nature, with supplying food for thought. His \u2018thoughts\u2019 he at that time expressed in the most direct form, almost in the sense in which the Duke employed the word when, feeling it to be out of date and a nuisance that the guests at his big parties at Guermantes should, in the visitors\u2019 book, append to their signatures a philosophico-poetical reflexion, he used to warn novices in an appealing tone: \u201cYour name, my dear fellow, but no \u2018thoughts\u2019 please!\u201d Well, it was these \u2018thoughts\u2019 of Victor Hugo (almost as entirely absent from the L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles as \u2018airs,\u2019 as \u2018melodies\u2019 are from Wagner\u2019s later manner) that Mme. de Guermantes admired in the early Hugo. Nor was she altogether wrong. They were touching, and already round about them, without their form\u2019s having yet the depth which it was to acquire only in later years, the rolling tide of words and of richly articulated rhymes put them beyond comparison with the lines that one might discover in a Corneille, for example, lines in which a Romanticism that is intermittent, restrained and so all the more moving, nevertheless has not at all penetrated to the physical sources of life, modified the unconscious and generalisable organism in which the idea is latent. And so I had been wrong in confining myself, hitherto, to the later volumes of Hugo. Of the earlier, of course, it was only a fractional part that Mme. de Guermantes used to embellish her conversation. But simply by quoting in this way an isolated line one multiplies its power of attraction tenfold. The lines that had entered or returned to my mind during this dinner magnetised in turn, summoned to themselves with such force the poems in the heart of which they were normally embedded, that my magnetised hands could not hold out for longer than forty-eight hours against the force that drew them towards the volume in which were bound up the Orientales and the Chants du Cr\u00e9puscule. I cursed Franchise\u2019s footman for having made a present to his native village of my copy of the Feuilles d\u2019Automne, and sent him off, with not a moment to be lost, to procure me another. I read these volumes from cover to cover and found peace of mind only when I suddenly came across, awaiting me in the light in which she had bathed them, the lines that I had heard Mme. de Guermantes quote. For all these reasons, conversations with the Duchess resembled the discoveries that we make in the library of a country house, out of date, incomplete, incapable of forming a mind, lacking in almost everything that we value, but offering us now and then some curious scrap of information, for instance the quotation of a fine passage which we did not know and as to which we are glad to remember in after years that we owe our knowledge of it to a stately mansion of the great. We are then, by having found Balzac\u2019s preface to the Chartreuse, or some unpublished letters of Joubert, tempted to exaggerate the value of the life we led there, the sterile frivolity of which, for this windfall of a single evening, we forget\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From this point of view, if the fashionable world had been unable, at the first moment, to provide what my imagination expected, and must consequently strike me first of all by what it had in common with all the other worlds rather than by its difference, still it revealed itself to me by degrees as something quite distinct. Great noblemen are almost the only people of whom one learns as much as one does of peasants; their conversation is adorned with everything that concerns the land, houses, as people used to live in them long ago, old customs, everything of which the world of money is profoundly ignorant. Even supposing that the aristocrat most moderate in his aspirations has finally overtaken the period in which he lives, his mother, his uncles, his great-aunts keep him in touch, when he recalls his childhood, with the conditions of a life almost unknown today. In the death-chamber of a contemporary corpse Mme. de Guermantes would not have pointed out, but would immediately have perceived, all the lapses from the traditional customs. She was shocked to see at a funeral women mingling with the men, when there was a particular ceremony which ought to be celebrated for the women. As for the pall, the use of which Bloch would doubtless have believed to be confined to coffins, on account of the pall bearers of whom one reads in the reports of funerals, M. de Guermantes could remember the time when, as a child, he had seen it borne at the wedding of M. de Mailly-Nesle. While Saint-Loup had sold his priceless \u2018Genealogical Tree,\u2019 old portraits of the Bouillons, letters of Louis XIII, in order to buy Carri\u00e8res and furniture in the modern style, M. and Mme. de Guermantes, moved by a sentiment in which the burning love of art may have played only a minor part, and which left them themselves more insignificant than before, had kept their marvellous Boule furniture, which presented a picture attractive in a different way to an artist. A literary man would similarly have been enchanted by their conversation, which would have been for him \u2014 for one hungry man has no need of another to keep him company \u2014 a living dictionary of all those expressions which every day are becoming more and more forgotten: Saint-Joseph cravats, children dedicated to the Blue, and so forth, which one finds to-day only among those people who have constituted themselves the friendly and benevolent custodians of the past. The pleasure that a writer, more than among other writers, feels among them is not without danger, for there is a risk of his coming to believe that the things of the past have a charm in themselves, of his transferring them bodily into his work, still-born in that case, exhaling a tedium for which he consoles himself with the reflexion: \u201cIt is attractive because it\u2019s true; that is how people do talk.\u201d These aristocratic conversations had moreover the charm, with Mme. de Guermantes, of being couched in excellent French. For this reason they made permissible on the Duchess\u2019s part her hilarity at the words \u2018viaticum,\u2019 \u2018cosmic,\u2019 \u2018pythian,\u2019 \u2018pre-eminent,\u2019 which Saint-Loup used to employ \u2014 as, similarly, at his Bing furniture\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When all was said, very different in this respect from what I had been able to feel before the hawthorns, or when I tasted a crumb of madeleine, the stories that I had heard at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s remained alien to me. Entering for a moment into me, who was only physically possessed by them, one would have said that, being of a social, not an individual nature, they were impatient to escape. I writhed in my seat in the carriage like the priestess of an oracle. I looked forward to another dinner-party at which I might myself become a sort of Prince Von to Mme. de Guermantes, and repeat them. In the meantime they made my lips quiver as I stammered them to myself, and I tried in vain to bring back and concentrate a mind that was carried away by a centrifugal force. And so it was with a feverish impatience not to have to bear the whole weight of them any longer by myself in a carriage where, for that matter, I atoned for the lack of conversation by soliloquising aloud, that I rang the bell at M. de Charlus\u2019s door, and it was in long monologues with myself, in which I rehearsed everything that I was going to tell him and gave scarcely a thought to what he might have to say to me, that I spent the whole of the time during which I was kept waiting in a drawing-room into which a footman shewed me and where I was incidentally too much excited to look at what it contained. I felt so urgent a need that M. de Charlus should listen to the stories which I was burning to tell him that I was bitterly disappointed to think that the master of the house was perhaps in bed, and that I might have to go home to sleep off by myself my drunkenness of words. I had just noticed, in fact, that I had been twenty-five minutes \u2014 that they had perhaps forgotten about me \u2014 in this room of which, despite this long wait, I could at the most have said that it was very big, greenish in colour, and contained a large number of portraits. The need to speak prevents one not merely from listening but from seeing things, and in this case the absence of any description of my external surroundings is tantamount to a description of my internal state. I was preparing to leave the room to try to get hold of some one, and if I found no one to make my way back to the hall and have myself let out, when, just as I had risen from my chair and taken a few steps across the mosaic parquet of the floor, a manservant came in, with a troubled expression: \u201cMonsieur le Baron has been engaged all evening, Sir,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere are still several people waiting to see him. I am doing everything I possibly can to get him to receive you, I have already telephoned up twice to the secretary.\u201d \u201cNo; please don\u2019t bother. I had an appointment with M. le Baron, but it is very late already, and if he is busy this evening I can come back another day.\u201d \u201cOh no, Sir, you must not go away,\u201d cried the servant. \u201cM. le Baron might be vexed. I will try again.\u201d I was reminded of the things I had heard about M. de Charlus\u2019s servants and their devotion to their master. One could not quite say of him as of the Prince de Conti that he sought to give pleasure as much to the valet as to the Minister, but he had shewn such skill in making of the least thing that he asked of them a sort of personal favour that at night, when, his body-servants assembled round him at a respectful distance, after running his eye over them he said: \u201cCoignet, the candlestick!\u201d or \u201cDucret, the nightshirt!\u201d it was with an envious murmur that the rest used to withdraw, jealous of him who had been singled out by his master\u2019s favour. Two of them, indeed, who could not abide one another, used to try to snatch the favour each from his rival by going on the most flimsy pretext with a message to the Baron, if he had gone upstairs earlier than usual, in the hope of being invested for the evening with the charge of candlestick or nightshirt. If he addressed a few words directly to one of them on some subject outside the scope of his duty, still more if in winter, in the garden, knowing that one of his coachmen had caught cold, he said to him, after ten minutes: \u201cPut your cap on!\u201d the others would not speak to the fellow again for a fortnight, in their jealousy of the great distinction that had been conferred on him. I waited ten minutes more, and then, after requesting me not to stay too long as M. le Baron was tired and had had to send away several most important people who had made appointments with him many days before, they admitted me to his presence. This setting with which M. de Charlus surrounded himself seemed to me a great deal less impressive than the simplicity of his brother Guermantes, but already the door stood open, I could see the Baron, in a Chinese dressing-gown, with his throat bare, lying upon a sofa. My eye was caught at the same moment by a tall hat, its nap flashing like a mirror, which had been left on a chair with a cape, as though the Baron had but recently come in. The valet withdrew. I supposed that M. de Charlus would rise to greet me. Without moving a muscle he fixed on me a pair of implacable eyes. I went towards him, I said good evening; he did not hold out his hand, made no reply, did not ask me to take a chair. After a moment\u2019s silence I asked him, as one would ask an ill-mannered doctor, whether it was necessary for me to remain standing. I said this without any evil intention, but my words seemed only to intensify the cold fury on M. de Charlus\u2019s face. I was not aware, as it happened, that at home, in the country, at the Ch\u00e2teau de Charlus, he was in the habit, after dinner (so much did he love to play the king) of sprawling in an armchair in the smoking-room, letting hi3 guests remain standing round him. He would ask for a light from one, offer a cigar to another and then, after a few minutes\u2019 interval, would say: \u201cBut Argencourt, why don\u2019t you sit down? Take a chair, my dear fellow,\u201d and so forth, having made a point of keeping them standing simply to remind them that it was from himself that permission came to them to be seated. \u201cPut yourself in the Louis XIV seat,\u201d he answered me with an imperious air, as though rather to force me to move away farther from himself than to invite me to be seated. I took an armchair which was comparatively near. \u201cAh! so that is what you call a Louis XIV seat, is it? I can see you have been well educated,\u201d he cried in derision. I was so much taken aback that I did not move, either to leave the house, as I ought to have done, or to change my seat, as he wished. \u201cSir,\u201d he next said to me, weighing each of his words, to the more impertinent of which he prefixed a double yoke of consonants, \u201cthe interview which I have condescended to grant you at the request of a person who desires to be nameless, will mark the final point in our relations. I shall not conceal from you that I had hoped for better things! I should perhaps be forcing the sense of the words a little, which one ought not to do, even with people who are ignorant of their value, simply out of the respect due to oneself, were I to tell you that I had felt a certain attraction towards you. I think, however, that benevolence, in its most actively protecting sense, would exceed neither what I felt nor what I was proposing to display. I had, immediately on my return to Paris, given you to understand, while you were still at Balbec, that you could count upon me.\u201d I who remembered with what a torrent of abuse M. de Charlus had parted from me at Balbec made an instinctive gesture of contradiction. \u201cWhat!\u201d he cried with fury, and indeed his face, convulsed and white, differed as much from his ordinary face as does the sea when on a morning of storm one finds instead of its customary smiling surface a thousand serpents writhing in spray and foam, \u201cdo you mean to pretend that you did not receive my message \u2014 almost a declaration \u2014 that you were to remember me? What was there in the way of decoration round the cover of the book that I sent you?\u201d \u201cSome very pretty twined garlands with tooled ornaments,\u201d I told him. \u201cAh!\u201d he replied, with an air of scorn, \u201cthese young Frenchmen know little of the treasures of our land. What would be said of a young Berliner who had never heard of the Walk\u00fcre? Besides, you must have eyes to see and see not, since you yourself told me that you had stood for two hours in front of that particular treasure. I can see that you know no more about flowers than you do about styles; don\u2019t protest that you know about styles,\u201d he cried in a shrill scream of rage, \u201cyou can\u2019t even tell me what you are sitting on. You offer your hindquarters a Directorychauffeuse as a Louis XIV berg\u00e8re. One of these days you\u2019ll be mistaking Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s knees for the seat of the rear, and a fine mess you\u2019ll make of things then. It\u2019s precisely the same; you didn\u2019t even recognise on the binding of Bergotte\u2019s book the lintel of myosotis over the door of Balbec church. Could there be any clearer way of saying to you: \u2018Forget me not!\u2019?\u201d I looked at M. de Charlus. Undoubtedly his magnificent head, though repellent, yet far surpassed that of any of his relatives; you would have called him an Apollo grown old; but an olive-hued, bilious juice seemed ready to start from the corners of his evil mouth; as for intellect, one could not deny that his, over a vast compass, had taken in many things which must always remain unknown to his brother Guermantes. But whatever the fine words with which he coloured all his hatreds, one felt that, even if there was now an offended pride, now a disappointment in love, or a rancour, or sadism, a love of teasing, a fixed obsession, this man was capable of doing murder, and of proving by force of logic that he had been right in doin^ it and was still superior by a hundred cubits in moral stature to his brother, his sister-in-law, or any of the rest. \u201cJust as, in Velazquez\u2019sLances,\u201d he went on, \u201cthe victor advances towards him who is the humbler in rank, as is the duty of every noble nature, since I was everything and you were nothing, it was I who took the first steps towards you. You have made an idiotic reply to what it is not for me to describe as an act of greatness. But I have not allowed myself to be discouraged. Our religion inculcates patience. The patience I have shewn towards you will be counted, I hope, to my credit, and also my having only smiled at what might be denounced as impertinence, were it within your power to offer any impertinence to me who surpass you in stature by so many cubits; but after all, Sir, all this is now neither here nor there. I have subjected you to the test which the one eminent man of our world has ingeniously named the test of excessive friendliness, and which he rightly declares to be the most terrible of all, the only one that can separate the good grain from the tares. I could scarcely reproach you for having undergone it without success, for those who emerge from it triumphant are very few. But at least, and this is the conclusion which I am entitled to draw from the last words that we shall exchange on this earth, at least I intend to hear nothing more of your calumnious fabrications.\u201d So far, I had never dreamed that M. de Charlus\u2019s rage could have been caused by an unflattering remark which had been repeated to him; I searched my memory; I had not spoken about him to anyone. Some evil-doer had invented the whole thing. I protested to-M. de Charlus that I had said absolutely nothing about him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can have annoyed you by saying to Mme. de Guermantes that I was a friend of yours.\u201d He gave a disdainful smile, made his voice climb to the supreme pitch of its highest register, and there, without strain, attacking the shrillest and most insolent note: \u201cOh! Sir,\u201d he said, returning by the most gradual stages to a natural intonation, and seeming to revel as he went in the oddities of this descending scale, \u201cI think that you are doing yourself an injustice when you accuse yourself of having said that we were friends. I do not look for any great verbal accuracy in anyone who could readily mistake a piece of Chippendale for a rococo chaire, but really I do not believe,\u201d he went on, with vocal caresses that grew more and more winning and brought to hover over his lips what was actually a charming smile, \u201cI do not believe that you can ever have said, or thought, that we were frlends! As for your having boasted that you had been presented to me, had talked to me, knew me slightly, had obtained, almost without solicitation, the prospect of coming one day under my protection, I find it on the contrary very natural and intelligent of you to have done so. The extreme difference in age that there is between us enables me to recognise without absurdity that thatpresentation, those talks, that vague prospect of future relations were for you, it is not for me to say an honour, but still, when all is said and done, an advantage as to which I consider that your folly lay not in divulging it but in not having had the sense to keep it. I will go so far as to say,\u201d he went on, passing abruptly for a moment from his arrogant wrath to a gentleness so tinged with melancholy that I expected him to burst into tears, \u201cthat when you left unanswered the proposal I made to you here in Paris it seemed to me so unheard-of an act on your part, coming from you who had struck me as well brought up and of a good bourgeois family,\u201d (on this adjective alone his voice sounded a little whistle of impertinence) \u201cthat I was foolish enough to imagine all the excuses that never really happen, letters miscarrying, addresses copied down wrong. I can see that on my part it was great foolishness, but Saint Bonaventure preferred to believe that an ox could fly rather than that his brother was capable of lying. Anyhow, that is all finished now, the idea did not attract you, there is no more to be said. It seems to me only that you might have brought yourself,\u201d (and there was a genuine sound of weeping in his voice) \u201cwere it only out of consideration for my age, to write to me. I had conceived and planned for you certain infinitely seductive things, which I had taken good care not to tell you. You have preferred to refuse without knowing what they were; that is your affair. But, as I tell you, one can always write. In your place, and indeed in my own, I should have done so. I like my place, for that reason, better than yours \u2014 I say \u2018for that reason\u2019 because I believe that we are all equal, and I have more fellow-feeling for an intelligent labourer than for many of our dukes. But I can say that I prefer my place to yours, because what you have done, in the whole course of my life, which is beginning now to be a pretty long one, I am conscious that I have never done.\u201d His head was turned away from the light, and I could not see if his eyes were dropping tears as I might have supposed from his voice. \u201cI told you that I had taken a hundred steps towards you; the only effect of that has been to make you retire two hundred from me. Now it is for me to withdraw, and we shall know one another no longer. I shall retain not your name but your story, so that at moments when I might be tempted to believe that men have good hearts, good manners, or simply the intelligence not to allow an unparalleled opportunity to escape them, I may remember that that is ranking them too highly. No, that you should have said that you knew me, when it was true \u2014 for henceforward it ceases to be true \u2014 I regard that as only natural, and I take it as an act of homage, that is to say something pleasant. Unfortunately, elsewhere and in other circumstances, you have uttered remarks of a very different nature.\u201d \u201cSir, I swear to you that I have said nothing that could insult you.\u201d \u201cAnd who says that I am insulted?\u201d he cried with fury, flinging himself into an erect posture on the seat on which hitherto he had been reclining motionless, while, as the pale frothing serpents stiffened in his face, his voice became alternately shrill and grave, like the deafening onrush of a storm. (The force with which he habitually spoke, which used to make strangers turn round in the street, was multiplied an hundredfold, as is a musical forte if, instead of being played on the piano, it is played by an orchestra, and changed into afortissimo as well. M. de Charlus roared.) \u201cDo you suppose that it is within your power to insult me? You evidently are not aware to whom you are speaking? Do you imagine that the envenomed spittle of five hundred little gentlemen of your type, heaped one upon another, would succeed in slobbering so much as the tips of my august toes?\u201d A moment before this my desire to persuade M. de Charlus that I had never said, nor heard anyone else say any evil of him had given place to a mad rage, caused by the words which were dictated to him solely, to my mind, by his colossal pride. Perhaps they were indeed the effect, in part at any rate, of this pride. Almost all the rest sprang from a feeling of which I was then still ignorant, and for which I could not therefore be blamed for not making due allowance. I could at least, failing this unknown element, have mingled with his pride, had I remembered the words of Mme. de Guermantes, a trace of madness. But at that moment the idea of madness never even entered my head. There was in him, according to me, only pride, in me there was only fury. This fury (at the moment when M. de Charlus ceased to shout, in order to refer to his august toes, with a majesty that was accompanied by a grimace, a nausea of disgust at his obscure blasphemers), this fury could contain itself no longer. With an impulsive movement, I wanted to strike something, and, a lingering trace of discernment making me respect the person of a man so much older than myself, and even, in view of their dignity as works of art, the pieces of German porcelain that were grouped around him, I flung myself upon the Baron\u2019s new silk hat, dashed it to the ground, trampled upon it, began blindly pulling it to pieces, wrenched off the brim, tore the crown in two, without heeding the vociferations of M. de Charlus, which continued to sound, and, crossing the room to leave it, opened the door. One on either side of it, to my intense stupefaction, stood two footmen, who moved slowly away, so as to appear only to have been casually passing in the course of their duty. (I afterwards learned their names; one was called Burnier, the other Charmel.) I was not taken in for a moment by this explanation which their leisurely gait seemed to offer me. It was highly improbable; three others appeared to me to be less so; one that the Baron sometimes entertained guests against whom, as he might happen to need assistance (but why?), he deemed it necessary to keep reinforcements posted close at hand. The second was that, drawn by curiosity, they had stopped to listen at the keyhole, not thinking that I should come out so quickly. The third, that, the whole of the scene which M. de Charlus had made with me having been prepared and acted, he had himself told them to listen, from a love of the spectacular combined, perhaps, with a \u2018nunc crudimini\u2018 from which each would derive a suitable profit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My anger had not calmed that of M. de Charlus, my departure from the room seemed to cause him acute distress; he called me back, made his servants call me back, and finally, forgetting that a moment earlier, when he spoke of his \u2018august toes,\u2019 he had thought to make me a witness of his own deification, came running after me at full speed, overtook me in the hall, and stood barring the door. \u201cThere, now,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t be childish; come back for a minute; he who loveth well chasteneth well, and if I have chastened you well it is because I love you well.\u201d My anger had subsided; I let the word \u2018chasten\u2019 pass, and followed the Baron, who, summoning a footman, ordered him without a trace of self-consciousness to clear away the remains of the shattered hat, which was replaced by another. \u201cIf you will tell me, Sir, who it is that has treacherously maligned me,\u201d I said to M. de Charlus, \u201cI will stay here to learn his name and to confute the impostor.\u201d \u201cWho? Do you not know? Do you retain no memory of the things you say? Do you think that the people who do me the service of informing me of those things do not begin by demanding secrecy? And do you imagine that I am going to betray a person to whom I have given my promise?\u201d \u201cSir, is it impossible then for you to tell me?\u201d I asked, racking my brains in a final effort to discover (and discovering no one) to whom I could have spoken about M. de Charlus. \u201cYou did not hear me say that I had given a promise of secrecy to my informant?\u201d he said in a snapping voice. \u201cI see that with your fondness for abject utterances you combine one for futile persistence. You ought to have at least the intelligence to profit by a final conversation, and so to speak as to say something that does not mean precisely nothing.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d I replied, moving away from him, \u201cyou insult me; I am unarmed, because you are several times my age, we are not equally matched; on the other hand, I cannot convince you; I have already sworn to you that I have said nothing.\u201d \u201cI am lying, then, am I?\u201d he cried in a terrifying tone, and with a bound forwards that brought him within a yard of myself. \u201cSome one has misinformed you.\u201d Then in a gentle, affectionate, melancholy voice, as in those symphonies which are played without any break between the different movements, in which a gracefulscherzo, amiable and idyllic, follows the thunder-peals of the opening pages: \u201cIt is quite possible,\u201d he told me. \u201cGenerally speaking, a remark repeated at second hand is rarely true. It is your fault if, not having profited by the opportunities of seeing me which I had held out to you, you have not furnished me, by that open speech of daily intercourse which creates confidence, with the unique and sovereign remedy against a spoken word which made you out a traitor. Either way, true or false, the remark has done its work. I can never again rid myself of the impression it made on me. I cannot even say that he who chasteneth well loveth well, for I have chastened you well enough but I no longer love you.\u201d While saying this he had forced me to sit down and had rung the bell. A different footman appeared. \u201cBring something to drink and order the brougham.\u201d I said that I was not thirsty and besides had a carriage waiting. \u201cThey have probably paid him and sent him away,\u201d he told me, \u201cyou needn\u2019t worry about that. I am ordering a carriage to take you home. . . . If you\u2019re anxious about the time . . . I could have given you a room here. . . . \u201d I said that my mother would be uneasy. \u201cAh! Of course, yes. Well, true or false, the remark has done its work. My affection, a trifle premature, had flowered too soon, and, like those apple trees of which you spoke so poetically at Balbec, it has been unable to withstand the first frost.\u201d If M. de Charlus\u2019s affection for me had not been destroyed, he could hardly have acted differently, since, while assuring me that we were no longer acquainted, he made me sit down, drink, asked me to stay the night, and was going now to send me home. He had indeed an air of dreading the moment at which he must part from me and find himself alone, that sort of slightly anxious fear which his sister-in-law and cousin Guermantes had appeared to me to be feeling when she had tried to force me to stay a little longer, with something of the same momentary fondness for myself, of the same effort to prolong the passing minute. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he went on, \u201cI have not the power to make blossom again what has once been destroyed. My affection for you is quite dead. Nothing can revive it. I believe that it is not unworthy of me to confess that I regret it. I always feel myself to be a little like Victor Hugo\u2019s Boaz: \u2018I am widowed and alone, and the darkness gathers o\u2019er me.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I passed again with him through the big green drawing-room. I told him, speaking quite at random, how beautiful I thought it. \u201cAin\u2019t it?\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to be fond of something. The woodwork is Bagard. What is rather charming, d\u2019you see, is that it was made to match the Beauvais chairs and the consoles. You observe, it repeats the same decorative design. There used to be only two places where you could see this, the Louvre and M. d\u2019Hinnisdal\u2019s house. But naturally, as soon as I had decided to come and live in this street, there cropped up an old family house of the Chimays which nobody had ever seen before because it came here expressly for me. On the whole, it\u2019s good. It might perhaps be better, but after all it\u2019s not bad. Some pretty things, ain\u2019t there? These are portraits of my uncles, the King of Poland and the King of England, by Mignard. But why am I telling you all this? You must know it as well as I do, you were waiting in this room. No? Ah, then they must have put you in the blue drawing-room,\u201d he said with an air that might have been either impertinence, on the score of my want of interest, or personal superiority, in not having taken the trouble to ask where I had been kept waiting. \u201cLook now, in this cabinet I have all the hats worn by Mlle. Elisabeth, by the Princesse de Lamballe, and by the Queen. They don\u2019t interest you, one would think you couldn\u2019t see. Perhaps you are suffering from an affection of the optic nerve. If you like this kind of beauty better, here is a rainbow by Turner beginning to shine out between these two Rembrandts, as a sign of our reconciliation. You hear: Beethoven has come to join him.\u201d And indeed one could hear the first chords of the third part of the Pastoral Symphony, \u2018Joy after the Storm,\u2019 performed somewhere not far away, on the first landing no doubt, by a band of musicians. I innocently inquired how they happened to be playing that, and who the musicians were. \u201cAh, well, one doesn\u2019t know. One never does know. They are unseen music. Pretty, ain\u2019t it?\u201d he said to me in a slightly impertinent tone, which, nevertheless, suggested somehow the influence and accent of Swann. \u201cBut you care about as much for it as a fish does for little apples. You want to go home, regardless of any want of respect for Beethoven or for me. You are uttering your own judgment and condemnation,\u201d he added, with an affectionate and mournful air, when the moment had come for me to go. \u201cYou will excuse my not accompanying you home, as good manners ordain that I should,\u201d he said to me. \u201cSince I have decided not to see you again, spending five minutes more in your company would make very little difference to me. But I am tired, and I have a great deal to do.\u201d And then, seeing that it was a fine night: \u201cVery well, yes, I will come in the carriage, there is a superb moon which I shall go on to admire from the Bois after I have taken you home. What, you don\u2019t know how to shave; even on a night when you\u2019ve been dining out, you have still a few hairs here,\u201d he said, taking my chin between two fingers, so to speak magnetised, which after a moment\u2019s resistance ran up to my ears, like the fingers of a barber. \u201cAh! It would be pleasant to look at the \u2018blue light of the moon\u2019 in the Bois with some one like yourself,\u201d he said to me with a sudden and almost involuntary gentleness, then, in a sadder tone: \u201cFor you are nice, all the same; you could be nicer than anyone,\u201d he went on, laying his hand in a fatherly way on my shoulder. \u201cOriginally, I must say that I found you quite insignificant.\u201d I ought to have reflected that he must find me so still. I had only to recall the rage with which he had spoken to me, barely half an hour before. In spite of this I had the impression that he was, for the moment, sincere, that his kindness of heart was prevailing over what I regarded as an almost delirious condition of susceptibility and pride. The carriage was waiting beside us, and still he prolonged the conversation. \u201cCome along,\u201d he said abruptly, \u201cjump in, in five minutes we shall be at your door. And I shall bid you a good night which will cut short our relations, and for all time. It is better, since we must part for ever, that we should do so, as in music, on a perfect chord.\u201d Despite these solemn affirmations that we should never see one another again, I could have sworn that M. de Charlus, annoyed at having forgotten himself earlier in the evening and afraid of having hurt my feelings, would not have been displeased to see me once again. Nor was I mistaken, for, a moment later: \u201cThere, now,\u201d he said, \u201cif I hadn\u2019t forgotten the most important thing of all. In memory of your grandmother, I have had bound for you a curious edition of Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. That is what is going to prevent this from being our last meeting. One must console oneself with the reflexion that complicated affairs are rarely settled in a day. Just look how long they took over the Congress of Vienna.\u201d \u201cBut I could call for it without disturbing you,\u201d I said obligingly. \u201cWill you hold your tongue, you little fool,\u201d he replied with anger, \u201cand not give yourself a grotesque appearance of regarding as a small matter the honour of being probably (I do not say certainly, for it will perhaps be one of my servants who hands you the volumes) received by me.\u201d Then, regaining possession of himself: \u201cI do not wish to part from you on these words. No dissonance, before the eternal silence of the dominant.\u201d It was for his own nerves that he seemed to dread an immediate return home after harsh words of dissension. \u201cYou would not care to come to the Bois?\u201d he addressed me in a tone not so much interrogative as affirmative, and that not, as it seemed to me, because he did not wish to make me the offer but because he was afraid that his self-esteem might meet with a refusal. \u201cOh, very well,\u201d he went on, still postponing our separation, \u201cit is the moment when, as Whistler says, the bourgeois go to bed\u201d (perhaps he wished now to capture me by my self-esteem) \u201cand the right time to begin to look at things. But you don\u2019t even know who Whistler was!\u201d I changed the conversation and asked him whether the Princesse d\u2019I\u00e9na was an intelligent person. M. de Charlus stopped me, and, adopting the most contemptuous tone that I had yet heard him use, \u201cOh! There, Sir,\u201d he informed me, \u201cyou are alluding to an order of nomenclature with which I have no concern. There is perhaps an aristocracy among the Tahitians, but I must confess that I know nothing about it. The name which you have just mentioned, strangely enough, did sound in my ears only a few days ago. Some one asked me whether I would condescend to allow them to present to me the young Duc de Guastalla. The request astonished me, for the Duc de Guastalla has no need to get himself presented to me, for the simple reason that he is my cousin, and has known me all his life; he is the son of the Princesse de Parme, and, as a young kinsman of good upbringing, he never fails to come and pay his respects to me on New Year\u2019s Day. But, on making inquiries, I discovered that it was not my relative who was meant but the son of the person in whom you are interested. As there exists no Princess of that title, I supposed that my friend was referring to some poor wanton sleeping under the Pont d\u2019I\u00e9na, who had picturesquely assumed the title of Princesse d\u2019I\u00e9na, just as one talks about the Panther of the Batignolles, or the Steel King. But no, the reference was to a rich person who possesses some remarkable furniture which I had seen and admired at an exhibition, and which has this advantage over the name of its owner that it is genuine. As for this self-styled Duc de Guastalla, he, I supposed, must be my secretary\u2019s stockbroker; one can procure so many things with money. But no; it was the Emperor, it appears, who amused himself by conferring on these people a title which simply was not his to give. It was perhaps a sign of power, or of ignorance, or of malice; in any case, I consider, it was an exceedingly scurvy trick to play on these unconscious usurpers. But really, I cannot help you by throwing any light on the matter; my knowledge begins and ends with the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where, among all the Courvoisiers and Gallardons, you will find, if you can manage to secure an introduction, plenty of mangy old cats taken straight out of Balzac who will amuse you. Naturally, all that has nothing to do with the position of the Princesse de Guermantes, but without me and my \u2018Open, Sesame\u2019 her portals are unapproachable.\u201d \u201cIt is really very lovely, isn\u2019t it, Sir, the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s mansion?\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s not very lovely. It\u2019s the loveliest thing in the world. Next to the Princess herself, of course.\u201d \u201cThe Princesse de Guermantes is better than the Duchesse de Guermantes?\u201d \u201cOh! There\u2019s no comparison.\u201d (It is to be observed that, whenever people in society have the least touch of imagination, they will crown or dethrone, to suit their affections or their quarrels, those whose position appeared most solid and unalterably fixed.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Duchesse de Guermantes\u201d (possibly, in not calling her \u2018Oriane,\u2019 he wished to set a greater distance between her and myself) \u201cis delightful, far superior to anything you can have guessed. But, after all, she is incommensurable with her cousin. The Princess is exactly what the people in the Markets might imagine Princess Metternich to have been, but old Metternich believed she had started Wagner, because she knew Victor Maurel. The Princesse de Guermantes, or rather her mother, knew the man himself. Which is a distinction, not to mention the incredible beauty of the lady. And the Esther gardens alone!\u201d \u201cOne can\u2019t see them?\u201d \u201cNo, you would have to be invited, but they never invite anyone unless I intervene.\u201d But at once withdrawing, after casting it at me, the bait of this offer, he held out his hand, for we had reached my door. \u201cMy part is played, Sir, I will simply add these few words. Another person will perhaps some day offer you his affection, as I have done. Let the present example serve for your instruction. Do not neglect it. Affection is always precious. What one cannot do by oneself in this life, because there are things which one cannot ask, nor do, nor wish, nor learn by oneself, one can do in company, and without needing to be Thirteen, as in Balzac\u2019s story, or Four, as in The Three Musketeers. Good-bye.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He must have been feeling tired and have abandoned the idea of going to look at the moonlight, for he asked me to tell his coachman to drive home. At once he made a sharp movement as though he had changed his mind. But I had already given the order, and, so as not to lose any more time, went across now to ring the bell, without its entering my head that I had been meaning to tell M. de Charlus, about the German Emperor and General Botha, stories which had been an hour ago such an obsession but which his unexpected and crushing reception had sent flying far out of my mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On entering my room I saw on my desk a letter which Franchise\u2019s young footman had written to one of his friends and had left lying there. Now that my mother was away, there was no liberty which he had the least hesitation in taking; I was the more to blame of the two for taking that of reading the letter which, without an envelope, lay spread out before me and (which was my sole excuse) seemed to offer itself to my eye\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDear Friend and Cousin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope this finds you in good health, and the same with all the young folk, particularly my young godson Joseph whom I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting but whom I prefer to you all as being my godson, these relics of the heart they have their dust also, upon their blest remains let us not lay our hands. Besides dear friend and cousin who can say that to-morrow you and your dear wife my cousin Marie, will not both of you be cast headlong down into the bottom of the sea, like the sailor clinging to the mast on high, for this life is but a dark valley. Dear friend I must tell you that my principal occupation, which will astonish you I am certain, is now poetry which I love passionately, for one must somehow pass the time away. And so dear friend do not be too surprised if I have not answered your last letter before now, in place of pardon let oblivion come. As you are aware, Madame\u2019s mother has passed away amid unspeakable sufferings which fairly exhausted her as she saw as many as three doctors. The day of her interment was a great day for all Monsieur\u2019s relations came in crowds as well as several Ministers. It took them more than two hours to get to the cemetery, which will make you all open your eyes pretty wide in your village for they certainly won\u2019t do as much for mother Michu. So all my life to come can be but one long sob. I am amusing myself enormously with the motorcycle of which I have recently learned. What would you say, my dear friends, if I arrived suddenly like that at full speed at Les Ecorces. But on that head I shall no more keep silence for I feel that the frenzy of grief sweeps its reason away. I am associating with the Duchesse de Guermantes, people whose very names you have never heard in our ignorant villages. Therefore it is with pleasure that I am going to send the works of Racine, of Victor Hugo, of Pages Choisies de Chenedolle, of Alfred de Musset, for I would cure the land in which I saw the light of ignorance which leads unerringly to crime. I can think of nothing more to say to you and send you like the pelican wearied by a long flight my best regards as well as to your wife my godson and your sister Rose. May it never be said of her: And Rose she lived only as live the roses, as has been said by Victor Hugo, the sonnet of Arvers, Alfred de Musset, all those great geniuses who for that cause have had to die upon the blazing scaffold like Jeanne d\u2019Arc. Hoping for your next letter soon, receive my kisses like those of a brother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cP\u00e9rigot (Joseph).\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are attracted by every form of life which represents to us something unknown and strange, by a last illusion still unshattered. In spite of this, the mysterious utterances by means of which M. de Charlus had led me to imagine the Princesse de Guermantes as an extraordinary creature, different from anyone that I knew, were not sufficient to account for the stupefaction in which I was plunged, speedily followed by the fear that I might be the victim of some bad joke planned by some one who wanted to send me to the door of a house to which I had not been invited, when, about two months after my dinner with the Duchess and while she was at Cannes, having opened an envelope the appearance of which had not led me to suppose that it contained anything out of the common, I read the following words engraved on a card: \u201cThe Princesse de Guermantes,n\u00e9e Duchesse en Bavi\u00e8re, At Home, the \u2014\u2014-th.\u201d No doubt to be invited to the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s was perhaps not, from the social point of view, any more difficult than to dine with the Duchess, and my slight knowledge of heraldry had taught me that the title of Prince is not superior to that of Duke. Besides, I told myself that the intelligence of a society woman could not be essentially so heterogeneous to that of her congeners as M. de Charlus made out, nor so heterogeneous to that of any one other woman in society. But my imagination, like Elstir engaged upon rendering some effect of perspective without reference to a knowledge of the laws of nature which he might quite well possess, depicted for me not what I knew but what it saw; what it saw, that is to say what the name shewed it. Now, even before I had met the Duchess, the name Guermantes preceded by the title of Princess, like a note or a colour or quantity, profoundly modified from the surrounding values by the mathematical or aesthetic sign that governs it, had already suggested to me something entirely different. With that title one finds one\u2019s thoughts straying instinctively to the memoirs of the days of Louis XIII and Louis XIV, the English Court, the Queen of Scots, the Duchesse d\u2019Aumale; and I imagined the town house of the Princesse de Guermantes as more or less frequented by the Duchesse de Longueville and the great Cond\u00e9, whose presence there rendered it highly improbable that I should ever make my way into it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many of the things that M. de Charlus had told me had driven a vigorous spur into my imagination and, making it forget how much the reality had disappointed me at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s (people\u2019s names are in this respect like the names of places), had swung it towards Oriane\u2019s cousin. For that matter, M. de Charlus misled me at times as to the imaginary value and variety of people in society only because he was himself at times misled. And this, perhaps, because he did nothing, did not write, did not paint, did not even read anything in a serious and thorough manner. But, superior by several degrees to the people in society, if it was from them and the spectacle they afforded that he drew the material for his conversation, he was not for that reason understood by them. Speaking as an artist, he could at the most reveal the fallacious charm of people in society. But reveal it to artists alone, with relation to whom he might be said to play the part played by the reindeer among the Esquimaux. This precious animal plucks for them from the barren rocks lichens and mosses which they themselves could neither discover nor utilise, but which, once they have been digested by the reindeer, become for the inhabitants of the far North a nourishing form of food\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To which I may add that the pictures which M. de Charlus drew of society were animated with plenty of life by the blend of his ferocious hatreds and his passionate affections. Hatreds directed mainly against the young men, adoration aroused principally by certain women\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If among these the Princesse de Guermantes was placed by M. de Charlus upon the most exalted throne, his mysterious words about the \u2018unapproachable Aladdin\u2019s palace\u2019 in which his cousin dwelt were not sufficient to account for my stupefaction. Apart from whatever may be due to the divers subjective points of view, of which I shall have to speak later, in these artificial magnifications, the fact remains that there is a certain objective reality in each of these people, and consequently a difference among them. And how, when it comes to that, could it be otherwise? The humanity with which we consort and which bears so little resemblance to our dreams is, for all that, the same that, in the Memoirs, in the Letters of eminent persons, we have seen described and have felt a desire to know. The old man of complete insignificance whom we met at dinner is the same who wrote that proud letter, which (in a book on the War of 1870) we read with emotion, to Prince Friedrich-Karl. We are bored at a dinner-table because our imagination is absent, and because it is bearing us company we are interested in a book. But the people in question are the same. We should like to have known Mme. de Pompadour, who was so valuable a patron of the arts, and we should have been as much bored in her company as among the modern Egerias, at whose houses we cannot bring ourselves to pay a second call, so uninteresting do we find them. The fact remains, nevertheless, that these differences do exist. People are never exactly similar to one another, their mode of behaviour with regard to ourselves, at, one might say, the same level of friendship, reveals differences which, in the end, offer compensations. When I knew Mme. de Montmorency, she loved to say unpleasant things to me, but if I was in need of a service she would squander, in the hope of obtaining it for me effectively, all the credit at her disposal, without counting the cost. Whereas some other woman, Mme. de Guermantes for example, would never have wished to hurt my feelings, never said anything about me except what might give me pleasure, showered on me all those tokens of friendship which formed the rich manner of living, morally, of the Guermantes, but, had I asked her for the least thing above and beyond that, would not have moved an inch to procure it for me, as in those country houses where one has at one\u2019s disposal a motor-car and a special footman, but where it is impossible to obtain a glass of cider, for which no provision has been made in the arrangements for a party. Which was for me the true friend, Mme. de Montmorency, so glad always to annoy me and always so ready to oblige, or Mme. de Guermantes, distressed by the slightest offence that might have been given me and incapable of the slightest effort to be of use to me? The types of the human mind are so varied, so opposite, not only in literature but in society, that Baudelaire and M\u00e9rim\u00e9e are not the only people who have the right to despise one another mutually. These peculiarities continue to form in everyone a system of attitudes, of speech, of actions, so coherent, so despotic, that when we are in the presence of anyone his or her system seems to us superior to the rest. With Mme. de Guermantes, her words, deduced like a theorem from her type of mind, seemed to me the only ones that could possibly be said. And I was, at heart, of her opinion when she told me that Mme. de Montmorency was stupid and kept an open mind towards all the things she did not understand, or when, having heard of some spiteful remark by that lady, she said: \u201cThat is what you call a good woman; it is what I call a monster.\u201d But this tyranny of the reality which confronts us, this preponderance of the lamplight which turns the dawn \u2014 already distant \u2014 as pale as the faintest memory, disappeared when I was away from Mme. de Guermantes, and a different lady said to me, putting herself on my level and reckoning the Duchess as placed far below either of us: \u201cOriane takes no interest, really, in anything or anybody,\u201d or even (what in the presence of Mme. de Guermantes it would have seemed impossible to believe, so loudly did she herself proclaim the opposite): \u201cOriane is a snob.\u201d Seeing that no mathematical process would have enabled one to convert Mme. d\u2019Arpajon and Mme. de Montpensier into commensurable quantities, it would have been impossible for me to reply, had anyone asked me which of the two seemed to me superior to the other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, among the peculiar characteristics of the drawing-room of the Princesse de Guermantes, the one most generally quoted was a certain exclusiveness, due in part to the royal birth of the Princess, but especially to the almost fossilised rigidity of the aristocratic prejudices of the Prince, prejudices which, incidentally, the Duke and Duchess had made no scruple about deriding in front of me, and which naturally were to make me regard it as more improbable than ever that I should have been invited to a party by this man who reckoned only in royalties and dukes, and at every dinner-party made a scene because he had not been put in the place to which he would have been entitled under Louis XIV, a place which, thanks to his immense erudition in matters of history and genealogy, he was the only person who knew. For this reason, many of the people in society placed to the credit of the Duke and Duchess the differences which distinguished them from their cousins. \u201cThe Duke and Duchess are far more modern, far more intelligent, they don\u2019t think of nothing, like the other couple, but how many quarterings one has, their house is three hundred years in advance of their cousins\u2019,\u201d were customary remarks, the memory of which made me tremble as I looked at the card of invitation, to which they gave a far greater probability of its having been sent me by some practical joker\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Duke and Duchess had not been still at Cannes, I might have tried to find out from them whether the invitation which I had received was genuine. This state of doubt in which I was plunged was not due, as I flattered myself for a time by supposing, to a sentiment which a man of fashion would not have felt and which, consequently, a writer, even if he belonged apart from his writership to the fashionable caste, ought to reproduce in order to be thoroughly \u2018objective\u2019 and to depict each class differently. I happened, in fact, only the other day, in a charming volume of memoirs, to come upon the record of uncertainties analogous to those which the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s card made me undergo. \u201cGeorges and I\u201d (or \u201cH\u00e9ly and I,\u201d I have not the book at hand to verify the reference) \u201cwere so keen to be asked to Mme. Delessert\u2019s that, having received an invitation from her, we thought it prudent, each of us independently, to make certain that we were not the victims of an April fool.\u201d Now, the writer is none other than the Comte d\u2019Haussonville (he who married the Duc de Broglie\u2019s daughter) and the other young man who \u2018independently\u2019 makes sure that he is not having a practical joke played on him is, according to whether he is called Georges or H\u00e9ly, one or other of the two inseparable friends of M. d\u2019Haussonville, either M. d\u2019Harcourt or the Prince de Chalais\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The day on which the party was to be given at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s, I learned that the Duke and Duchess had just returned to Paris. The Princess\u2019s ball would not have brought them back, but one of their cousins was seriously ill, and moreover the Duke was greatly taken up with a revel which was to be held the same night, and at which he himself was to appear as Louis XI and his wife as Isabel of Bavaria. And I determined to go and see her that morning. But, having gone out early, they had not yet returned; I watched first of all from a little room, which had seemed to me to be a good look-out post, for the arrival of their carriage. As a matter of fact I had made a singularly bad choice in my observatory from which I could barely make out our courtyard, but I did see into several others, and this, though of no value to me, occupied my mind for a time. It is not only in Venice that one has those outlooks on to several houses at once which have proved so tempting to painters; it is just the same in Paris. Nor do I cite Venice at random. It is of its poorer quarters that certain poor quarters of Paris make one think, in the morning, with their tall, wide chimneys to which the sun imparts the most vivid pinks, the brightest reds; it is a whole garden that flowers above the houses, and flowers in such a variety of tints that one would call it, planted on top of the town, the garden of a tulip-fancier of Delft or Haarlem. And then also, the extreme proximity of the houses, with their windows looking opposite one another on to a common courtyard, makes of each casement the frame in which a cook sits dreamily gazing down at the ground below, in which farther off a girl is having her hair combed by an old woman with the face, barely distinguishable in the shadow, of a witch: thus each courtyard provides for the adjoining house, by suppressing all sound in its interval, by leaving visible a series of silent gestures in a series of rectangular frames, glazed by the closing of the windows, an exhibition of a hundred Dutch paintings hung in rows. Certainly from the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes one did not have the same kind of view, but one had curious views also, especially from the strange trigonometrical point at which I had placed myself and from which one\u2019s gaze was arrested by nothing nearer than the distant heights formed by the comparatively vague plots of ground which preceded, on a steep slope, the mansion of the Marquise de Plassac and Mme. de Tresmes, cousins (of the most noble category) of M. de Guermantes, whom I did not know. Between me and this house (which was that of their father, M. de Br\u00e9quigny) nothing but blocks of buildings of low elevation, facing in every conceivable direction, which, without blocking the view, increased the distance with their diagonal perspective. The red-tiled turret of the coach-house in which the Marquis de Fr\u00e9court kept his carriages did indeed end in a spire that rose rather higher, but was so slender that it concealed nothing, and made one think of those picturesque old buildings in Switzerland which spring up in isolation at the foot of a mountain. All these vague and divergent points on which my eyes rested made more distant apparently than if it had been separated from us by several streets or by a series of foothills the house of Mme. de Plassac, actually quite near but chimerically remote as in an Alpine landscape. When its large paned windows, glittering in the sunlight like flakes of rock crystal, were thrown open so as to air the rooms, one felt, in following from one floor to the next the footmen whom it was impossible to see clearly but who were visibly shaking carpets, the same pleasure as when one sees in a landscape by Turner or Elstir a traveller in a mail-coach, or a guide, at different degrees of altitude on the Saint-Gothard. But from this point of view in which I had ensconced myself I should have been in danger of not seeing M. or Mme. de Guermantes come in, so that when in the afternoon I was free to resume my survey I simply stood on the staircase, from which the opening of the carriage-gate could not escape my notice, and it was on this staircase that I posted myself, albeit there did not appear there, so entrancing with their footmen rendered minute by distance and busily cleaning, the Alpine beauties of the Br\u00e9quigny-Tresmes mansion. Now this wait on the staircase was to have for me consequences so considerable, and to reveal to me a picture no longer Turneresque but ethical, of so great importance, that it is preferable to postpone the account of it for a little while by interposing first that of my visit to the Guermantes when I knew that they had come home. It was the Duke alone who received me in the library. As I went in there came out a little man with snow-white hair, a look of poverty, a little black neckcloth such as was worn by the lawyer at Combray and by several of my grandfather\u2019s friends, but of a more timid aspect than they, who, making me a series of profound bows, refused absolutely to go downstairs until I had passed him. The Duke shouted after him from the library something which I did not understand, and the other responded with further bows, addressed to the wall, for the Duke could not see him, but endlessly repeated nevertheless, like the purposeless smiles on the faces of people who are talking to one over the telephone; he had a falsetto voice, and saluted me afresh with the humility of a man of business. And he might, for that matter, have been a man of business from Combray, so much was he in the style, provincial, out of date and mild, of the small folk, the modest elders of those parts. \u201cYou shall see Oriane in a minute,\u201d the Duke told me when I had entered the room. \u201cAs Swann is coming in presently and bringing her the proofs of his book on the coinage of the Order of Malta, and, what is worse, an immense photograph he has had taken shewing both sides of each of the coins, Oriane preferred to get dressed early so that she can stay with him until it\u2019s time to go out to dinner. We have such a heap of things in the house already that we don\u2019t know where to put them all, and I ask myself where on earth we are going to stick this photograph. But I have too good-natured a wife, who is too fond of giving people pleasure. She thought it would be polite to ask Swann to let her see side by side on one sheet the heads of all those Grand Masters of the Order whose medals he has found at Rhodes. I said Malta, didn\u2019t I, it is Rhodes, but it\u2019s all the same Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. As a matter of fact, she is interested in them only because Swann makes a hobby of it. Our family is very much mixed up in the whole story; even at the present day, my brother, whom you know, is one of the highest dignitaries in the Order of Malta. But I might have told all that to Oriane, she simply wouldn\u2019t have listened to me. On the other hand, it was quite enough that Swann\u2019s researches into the Templars (it\u2019s astonishing the passion that people of one religion have for studying others) should have led him on to the history of the Knights of Rhodes, who succeeded the Templars, for Oriane at once to insist on seeing the heads of these Knights. They were very small fry indeed compared with the Lusignans, Kings of Cyprus, from whom we descend in a direct line. But so far, as Swann hasn\u2019t taken them up, Oriane doesn\u2019t care to hear anything about the Lusignans.\u201d I could not at once explain to the Duke why I had come. What happened was that several relatives or friends, including Mme. de Silistrie and the Duchesse de Montrose, came to pay a call on the Duchess, who was often at home before dinner, and not finding her there stayed for a short while with the Duke. The first of these ladies (the Princesse de Silistrie), simply attired, with a dry but friendly manner, carried a stick in her hand. I was afraid at first that she had injured herself, or was a cripple. She was on the contrary most alert. She spoke regretfully to the Duke of a first cousin of his own \u2014 not on the Guermantes side, but more illustrious still, were that possible \u2014 whose health, which had been in a grave condition for some time past, had grown suddenly worse. But it was evident that the Duke, while full of pity for his cousin\u2019s lot, and repeating \u201cPoor Mama! He\u2019s such a good fellow!\u201d had formed a favourable prognosis. The fact was that the dinner at which the Duke was to be present amused him, the big party at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s did not bore him, but above all he was to go on at one o\u2019clock in the morning with his wife to a great supper and costume ball, with a view to which a costume of Louis XI for himself, and one of Isabel of Bavaria for his wife were waiting in readiness. And the Duke was determined not to be disturbed amid all these gaieties by the sufferings of the worthy Amanien d\u2019Osmond. Two other ladies carrying sticks, Mme. de Plassac and Mme. de Tresmes, both daughters of the Comte de Br\u00e9quigny, came in next to pay Basin a visit, and declared that cousin Mama\u2019s state left no room now for hope. The Duke shrugged his shoulders, and to change the conversation asked whether they were going that evening to Marie-Gilbert\u2019s. They replied that they were not, in view of the state of Amanien who was in his last agony, and indeed they had excused themselves from the dinner to which the Duke was going, the other guests at which they proceeded to enumerate: the brother of King Theodosius, the Infanta Maria Concepcion, and so forth. As the Marquis d\u2019Osmond was less nearly related to them than he was to Basin, their \u2018defection\u2019 appeared to the Duke to be a sort of indirect reproach aimed at his own conduct. And so, albeit they had come down from the heights of the Br\u00e9quigny mansion to see the Duchess (or rather to announce to her the alarming character, incompatible for his relatives with attendance at social gatherings, of their cousin\u2019s illness) they did not stay long, and, each armed with her alpenstock, Walpurge and Doroth\u00e9e (such were the names of the two sisters) retraced the craggy path to their citadel. I never thought of asking the Guermantes what was the meaning of these sticks, so common in a certain part of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Possibly, looking upon the whole parish as their domain, and not caring to hire cabs, they were in the habit of taking long walks, for which some old fracture, due to immoderate indulgence in the chase, and to the falls from horseback which are often the fruit of that indulgence, or simply rheumatism caused by the dampness of the left bank and of old country houses made a stick necessary. Perhaps they had not set out upon any such long expedition through the quarter, but, having merely come down into their garden (which lay at no distance from that of the Duchess) to pick the fruit required for stewing, had looked in on their way home to bid good evening to Mme. de Guermantes, though without going so far as to bring a pair of shears or a watering-can into her house. The Duke appeared touched that I should have come to see them so soon after their return to Paris. But his face grew dark when I told him that I had come to ask his wife to find out whether her cousin really had invited me. I had touched upon one of those services which M. and Mme. de Guermantes were not fond of rendering. The Duke explained to me that it was too late, that if the Princess had not sent me an invitation it would make him appear to be asking her for one, that his cousins had refused him one once before, and he had no wish to appear either directly or indirectly to be interfering with their visiting list, be \u2018meddling\u2019; finally, he could not even be sure that he and his wife, who were dining out that evening, would not come straight home afterwards, that in that case their best excuse for not having gone to the Princess\u2019s party would be to conceal from her the fact of their return to Paris, instead of hastening to inform her of it, as they must do if they sent her a note, or spoke to her over the telephone about me, and certainly too late to be of any use, since, in all probability, the Princess\u2019s list of guests would be closed by now. \u201cYou\u2019ve not fallen foul of her in any way?\u201d he asked in a suspicious tone, the Guermantes living in a constant fear of not being informed of the latest society quarrels, and so of people\u2019s trying to climb back into favour on their shoulders. Finally, as the Duke was in the habit of taking upon himself all decisions that might seem not very good-natured: \u201cListen, my boy,\u201d he said to me suddenly, as though the idea had just come into his head, \u201cI would really rather not mention at all to Oriane that you have been speaking to me about it. You know how kind-hearted she is; besides, she has an enormous regard for you, she would insist on sending to ask her cousin, in spite of anything I might say to the contrary, and if she is tired after dinner, there will be no getting out of it, she will be forced to go to the party. No, decidedly, I shall say nothing to her about it. Anyhow, you will see her yourself in a minute. But not a word about that matter, I beg of you. If you decide to go to the party, I have no need to tell you what a pleasure it will be to us to spend the evening there with you.\u201d The motives actuating humanity are too sacred for him before whom they are invoked not to bow to them, whether he believes them to be sincere or not; I did not wish to appear to be weighing in the balance for a moment the relative importance of my invitation and the possible tiredness of Mme. de Guermantes, and I promised not to speak to her of the object of my visit, exactly as though I had been taken in by the little farce which M. de Guermantes had performed for my benefit. I asked him if he thought there was any chance of my seeing Mme. de Stermaria at the Princess\u2019s. \u201cWhy, no,\u201d he replied with the air of an expert; \u201cI know the name you mention, from having seen it in lists of club members, it is not at all the type of person who goes to Gilbert\u2019s. You will see nobody there who is not excessively proper and intensely boring, duchesses bearing titles which one thought were extinct years ago and which they have revived for the occasion, all the Ambassadors, heaps of Coburgs, foreign royalties, but you mustn\u2019t hope for the ghost of a Stermaria. Gilbert would be taken ill at the mere thought of such a thing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait now, you\u2019re fond of painting, I must shew you a superb picture I bought from my cousin, partly in exchange for the Elstirs, which frankly did not appeal to us. It was sold to me as a Philippe de Champaigne, but I believe myself that it\u2019s by some one even greater. Would you like to know my idea? I believe it to be a Velazquez, and of the best period,\u201d said the Duke, looking me boldly in the eyes, whether to learn my impression or in the hope of enhancing it. A footman came in. \u201cMme. la Duchesse has told me to ask M. le Duc if M. le Duc will be so good as to see M. Swann, as Mme. la Duchesse is not quite ready.\u201d \u201cShew M. Swann in,\u201d said the Duke, after looking at his watch and seeing that he had still a few minutes before he need go to dress. \u201cNaturally my wife, who told him to come, is not ready. There\u2019s no use saying anything before Swann about Marie-Gilbert\u2019s party,\u201d said the Duke. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s been invited. Gilbert likes him immensely, because he believes him to be the natural grandson of the Duc de Berri, but that\u2019s a long story. (Otherwise, you can imagine! My cousin, who falls in a fit if he sees a Jew a mile off.) But now, don\u2019t you see, the Dreyfus case has made things more serious. Swann ought to have realised that he more than anyone must drop all connexion with those fellows, instead of which he says the most offensive things.\u201d The Duke called back the footman to know whether the man who had been sent to inquire at cousin Osmond\u2019s had returned. His plan was as follows: as he believed, and rightly, that his cousin was dying, he was anxious to obtain news of him before his death, that is to say before he was obliged to go into mourning. Once covered by the official certainty that Amanien was still alive, he could go without a thought to his dinner, to the Prince\u2019s party, to the midnight revel at which he would appear as Louis XI, and had made the most exciting assignation with a new mistress, and would make no more inquiries until the following day, when his pleasures would be at an end. Then one would put on mourning if the cousin had passed away in the night. \u201cNo, M. le Duc, he is not back yet.\u201d \u201cWhat in the Name of God! Nothing is ever done in this house till the last minute,\u201d cried the Duke, at the thought that Amanien might still be in time to \u2018croak\u2019 for an evening paper, and so make him miss his revel. He sent for the Temps, in which there was nothing. I had not seen Swann for a long time, and asked myself at first whether in the old days he used to clip his moustache, or had not his hair brushed up vertically in front, for I found in him something altered; it was simply that he was indeed greatly \u2018altered\u2019 because he was very ill, and illness produces in the face modifications as profound as are created by growing a beard or by changing the line of one\u2019s parting. (Swann\u2019s illness was the same that had killed his mother, who had been attacked by it at precisely the age which he had now reached. Our existences are in truth, owing to heredity, as full of cabalistic ciphers, of horoscopic castings as if there really were sorcerers in the world. And just as there is a certain duration of life for humanity in general, so there is one for families in particular, that is to say, in any one family, for the members of it who resemble one another.) Swann was dressed with an elegance which, like that of his wife, associated with what he now was what he once had been. Buttoned up in a pearl-grey frockcoat which emphasised the tallness of his figure, slender, his white gloves stitched in black, he carried a grey tall hat of a specially wide shape which Delion had ceased now to make except for him, the Prince de Sagan, the Marquis de Mod\u00e8ne, M. Charles Haas and Comte Louis de Turenne. I was surprised at the charming smile and affectionate handclasp with which he replied to my greeting, for I had imagined that after so long an interval he would not recognise me at once; I told him of my astonishment; he received it with a shout of laughter, a trace of indignation and a further grip of my hand, as if it were throwing doubt on the soundness of his brain or the sincerity of his affection to suppose that he did not know me. And yet that was what had happened; he did not identify me, as I learned long afterwards, until several minutes later when he heard my name mentioned. But no change in his face, in his .speech, in the things he said to me betrayed the discovery which a chance word from M. de Guermantes had enabled him to make, with such mastery, with such absolute sureness did he play the social game. He brought to it, moreover, that spontaneity in manners and personal initiative, even in his style of dress, which characterised the Guermantes type. Thus it was that the greeting which the old clubman, without recognising me, had given me was not the cold and stiff greeting of the man of the world who was a pure formalist, but a greeting full of a real friendliness, of a true charm, such as the Duchesse de Guermantes, for instance, possessed (carrying it so far as to smile at you first, before you had bowed to her, if she met you in the street), in contrast to the more mechanical greeting customary among the ladies of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. In the same way, again, the hat which, in conformity with a custom that was beginning to disappear, he laid on the floor by his feet, was lined with green leather, a thing not usually done, because, according to him, this kept the hat much cleaner, in reality because it was highly becoming. \u201cNow, Charles, you\u2019re a great expert, come and see what I\u2019ve got to shew you, after which, my boys, I\u2019m going to ask your permission to leave you together for a moment while I go and change my clothes, besides, I expect Oriane won\u2019t be long now.\u201d And he shewed his \u2018Velazquez\u2019 to Swann. \u201cBut it seems to me that I know this,\u201d said Swann with the grimace of a sick man for whom the mere act of speaking requires an effort. \u201cYes,\u201d said the Duke, turned serious by the time which the expert took in expressing his admiration. \u201cYou have probably seen it at Gilbert\u2019s.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, of course, I remember.\u201d \u201cWhat do you suppose it is?\u201d \u201cOh, well, if it cornes from Gilbert\u2019s, it is probably one of your ancestors,\u201d said Swann with a blend of irony and deference towards a form of greatness which he would have felt it impolite and absurd to despise, but to which for reasons of good taste he preferred to make only a playful reference\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo be sure, it is,\u201d said the Duke bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s Boson, the I forget how manieth de Guermantes. Not that I care a damn about that. You know I\u2019m not as feudal as my cousin. I\u2019ve heard the names mentioned of Rigaud, Mignard, Velazquez even!\u201d he went on, fastening on Swann the gaze of an inquisitor and executioner in an attempt at once to read into his mind and to influence his response. \u201cWell,\u201d he concluded, for when he was led to provoke artificially an opinion which he desired to hear, he had the faculty, after a few moments, of believing that it had been spontaneously uttered; \u201ccome, now, none of your flattery, do you think it\u2019s by one of those big masters I\u2019ve mentioned?\u201d \u201cNnnnno,\u201d said Swann. \u201cBut after all, I know nothing about these things, it\u2019s not for me to decide who daubed the canvas. But you\u2019re a dilettante, a master of the subject, to whom do you attribute it? You\u2019re enough of an expert to have some idea. What would you put it down as?\u201d Swann hesitated for a moment before the picture, which obviously he thought atrocious. \u201cA bad joke!\u201d he replied with a smile at the Duke who could not check an impulsive movement of rage. When this had subsided: \u201cBe good fellows, both of you, wait a moment for Oriane, I must go and put on my swallow-tails and then I\u2019ll join you. I shall send word to my good woman that you\u2019re both waiting for her.\u201d I talked for a minute or two with Swann about the Dreyfus case, and asked him how it was that all the Guermantes were anti-Dreyfusards. \u201cIn the first place because at heart all these people are anti-Semites,\u201d replied Swann, who, all the same, knew very well from experience that certain of them were not, but, like everyone who supports any cause with ardour, preferred, to explain the fact that other people did not share his opinion, to suppose in them a preconceived reason, a prejudice against which there was nothing to be done, rather than reasons which might permit of discussion. Besides, having come to the premature term of his life, like a weary animal that is goaded on, he cried out against these persecutions and was returning to the spiritual fold of his fathers. \u201cYes, the Prince de Guermantes,\u201d I said, \u201cit is true, I\u2019ve heard that he was anti-semitic.\u201d \u201cOh, that fellow! I wasn\u2019t even thinking about him. He carries it to such a point that when he was in the army and had a frightful toothache he preferred to grin and bear it rather than go to the only dentist in the district, who happened to be a Jew, and later on he allowed a wing of his castle which had caught fire to be burned to the ground, because he would have had to send for extinguishers to the place next door, which belongs to the Rothschilds.\u201d \u201cAre you going to be there this evening, by any chance?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Swann replied, \u201calthough I am far too tired. But he sent me a wire to tell me that he has something to say to me. I feel that I shall be too unwell in the next few days to go there or to see him at home; it would upset me, so I prefer to get it over at once.\u201d \u201cBut the Duc de Guermantes is not anti-semitic?\u201d \u201cYou can see quite well that he is, since he\u2019s an anti-Dreyfusard,\u201d replied Swann, without noticing the logical fallacy. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t prevent my being very sorry that I disappointed the man \u2014 what am I saying? The Duke, I mean \u2014 by not admiring his Mignard or whatever he calls it.\u201d \u201cBut at any rate,\u201d I went on, reverting to the Dreyfus case, \u201cthe Duchess, she, now, is intelligent.\u201d \u201cYes, she is charming. To my mind, however, she was even more charming when she was still known as the Princesse des Laumes. Her mind has become somehow more angular, it was all much softer in the juvenile great lady, but after all, young or old, men or women, what can you expect, all these people belong to a different race, one can\u2019t have a thousand years of feudalism in one\u2019s blood with impunity. Naturally they imagine that it counts for nothing in their opinions.\u201d \u201cAll the same, Robert de Saint-Loup is a Dreyfusard.\u201d \u201cAh! So much the better, all the more as you know that his mother is extremely \u2018and.\u2019 I had heard that he was, but I wasn\u2019t certain of it. That gives me a great deal of pleasure. It doesn\u2019t surprise me, he\u2019s highly intelligent. It\u2019s a great thing, that is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dreyfusism had brought to Swann an extraordinary simplicity of mind and had imparted to his way of looking at things an impulsiveness, an inconsistency more noticeable even than had been the similar effects of his marriage to Odette; this new loss of caste would have been better described as a recasting, and was entirely to his credit, since it made him return to the ways in which his forebears had trodden and from which he had turned aside to mix with the aristocracy. But Swann, just at the very moment when with such lucidity it had been granted to him, thanks to the gifts he had inherited from his race, to perceive a truth that was still hidden from people of fashion, shewed himself nevertheless quite comically blind. He subjected afresh all his admirations and all his contempts to the test of a new criterion, Dreyfusism. That the anti-Dreyfusism of Mme. Bontemps should have made him think her a fool was no more astonishing than that, when he was first married, he should have thought her intelligent. It was not very serious either that the new wave reached also his political judgments and made him lose all memory of having treated as a man with a price, a British spy (this latter was an absurdity of the Guermantes set), Clemenceau, whom he declared now to have always stood up for conscience, to be a man of iron, like Comely. \u201cNo, no, I never told you anything of the sort. You\u2019re thinking of some one else.\u201d But, sweeping past his political judgments, the wave overthrew in Swann his literary judgments also, and even affected his way of pronouncing them. Barr\u00e9s had lost all his talent, and even the books of his early days were feeble, one could hardly read them again. \u201cYou try, you\u2019ll find you can\u2019t struggle to the end. What a difference from Clemenceau! Personally, I am not anticlerical, but when you compare them together you must see that Barr\u00e9s is invertebrate. He\u2019s a very great fellow, is old Clemenceau. How he knows the language!\u201d However, the anti-Dreyfusards were in no position to criticise these follies. They explained that one was a Dreyfusard by one\u2019s being of Jewish origin. If a practising Catholic like Saniette stood out also for a fresh trial, that was because he was buttonholed by Mme. Verdurin, who behaved like a wild Radical. She was out above all things against the \u2018frocks.\u2019 Saniette was more fool than knave, and had no idea of the harm that the Mistress was doing him. If you pointed out that Brichot was equally a friend of Mme. Verdurin and was a member of the Patrie Fran\u00e7aise, that was because he was more intelligent. \u201cYou see him occasionally?\u201d I asked Swann, referring to Saint-Loup. \u201cNo, never. He wrote to me the other day hoping that I would ask the Duc de Mouchy and various other people to vote for him at the Jockey, where for that matter he got through like a letter through the post.\u201d \u201cIn spite of the Case!\u201d \u201cThe question was never raised. However I must tell you that since all this business began I never set foot in the place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes returned, and was presently joined by his wife, all ready now for the evening, tall and proud in a gown of red satin the skirt of which was bordered with spangles. She had in her hair a long ostrich feather dyed purple, and over her shoulders a tulle scarf of the same red as her dress. \u201cHow nice it is to have one\u2019s hat lined with leather,\u201d said the Duchess, whom nothing escaped. \u201cHowever, with you, Charles, everything is always charming, whether it\u2019s what you wear or what you say what you read or what you do.\u201d Swann meanwhile, without apparently listening, was considering the Duchess as he would have studied the canvas of a master, and then sought her gaze, making with his lips the grimace which implies: \u2018The devil!\u2019 Mme. de Guermantes rippled with laughter. \u201cSo my clothes please you? I\u2019m delighted. But I must say that they don\u2019t please me much,\u201d she went on with a sulking air. \u201cGood Lord, what a bore it is to have to dress up and go out when one would ever so much rather stay at home!\u201d \u201cWhat magnificent rubies!\u201d \u201cAh! my dear Charles, at least one can see that you know what you\u2019re talking about, you\u2019re not like that brute Monserfeuil who asked me if they were real. I must say that I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like them. They were a present from the Grand Duchess. They\u2019re a little too large for my liking, a little too like claret glasses filled to the brim, but I\u2019ve put them on because we shall be seeing the Grand Duchess this evening at Marie-Gilbert\u2019s,\u201d added Mme. de Guermantes, never suspecting that this assertion destroyed the force of those previously made by the Duke. \u201cWhat\u2019s on at the Princess\u2019s?\u201d inquired Swann. \u201cPractically nothing,\u201d the Duke hastened to reply, the question having made him think that Swann was not invited. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, Basin? When all the highways and hedgerows have been scoured? It will be a deathly crush. What will be pretty, though,\u201d she went on, looking wistfully at Swann, \u201cif the storm I can feel in the air now doesn\u2019t break, will be those marvellous gardens. You know them, of course. I was there a month ago, at the time when the lilacs were in flower, you can\u2019t have any idea how lovely they were. And then the fountain, really, it\u2019s Versailles in Paris.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of person is the Princess?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy, you know quite well, you\u2019ve seen her here, she\u2019s as beautiful as the day, also rather an idiot. Very nice, in spite of all her Germanic high-and-mightiness, full of good nature and stupid mistakes.\u201d Swann was too subtle not to perceive that the Duchess, in this speech, was trying to shew the \u2018Guermantes wit,\u2019 and at no great cost to herself, for she was only serving up in a less perfect form an old saying of her own. Nevertheless, to prove to the Duchess that he appreciated her intention to be, and as though she had really succeeded in being, funny, he smiled with a slightly forced air, causing me by this particular form of insincerity the same feeling of awkwardness that used to disturb me long ago when I heard my parents discussing with M. Vinteuil the corruption of certain sections of society (when they knew very well that a corruption far greater sat enthroned at Montjouvain), Legrandin colouring his utterances for the benefit of fools, choosing delicate epithets which he knew perfectly well would not be understood by a rich or smart but illiterate public. \u201cCome now, Oriane, what on earth are you saying?\u201d broke in M. de Guermantes. \u201cMarie a fool? Why, she has read everything, she\u2019s as musical as a fiddle.\u201d \u201cBut, my poor little Basin, you\u2019re as innocent as a new-born babe. As if one could not be all that, and rather an idiot as well. Idiot is too strong a word; no, she\u2019s in the clouds, she\u2019s Hesse-Darmstadt, Holy Roman Empire, and! wa-wa-wa. Her pronunciation alone makes me tired. But I quite admit that she\u2019s a charming loony. Simply the idea of stepping down from her German throne to go and marry, in the most middle-class way, a private citizen. It is true that she chose him! Yes, it\u2019s quite true,\u201d she went on, turning to me, \u201cyou don\u2019t know Gilbert. Let me give you an idea of him, he took to his bed once because I had left a card on Mme. Carnot. But, my little Charles,\u201d said the Duchess, changing the conversation when she saw that the story of the card left on the Carnots appeared to irritate M. de Guermantes, \u201cyou know, you\u2019ve never sent me that photograph of our Knights of Rhodes, whom I\u2019ve learned to love through you, and I am so anxious to make their acquaintance.\u201d The Duke meanwhile had not taken his eyes from his wife\u2019s face. \u201cOriane, you might at least tell the story properly and not cut out half. I ought to explain,\u201d he corrected, addressing Swann, \u201cthat the British Ambassadress at that time, who was a very worthy woman, but lived rather in the moon and was in the habit of making up these odd combinations, conceived the distinctly quaint idea of inviting us with the President and his wife. We were \u2014 Oriane herself was rather surprised, especially as the Ambassadress knew quite enough of the people we knew not to invite us, of all things, to so ill-assorted a gathering. There was a Minister there who is a swindler, however I pass over all that, we had not been warned in time, were caught in the trap, and, I\u2019m bound to admit, all these people behaved most civilly to us. Only, once was enough. Mme. de Guermantes, who does not often do me the honour of consulting me, felt it incumbent upon her to leave a card in the course of the following week at the Elys\u00e9e. Gilbert may perhaps have gone rather far in regarding it as a stain upon our name. But it must not be forgotten that, politics apart, M. Carnot, who for that matter filled his post quite adequately, was the grandson of a member of the Revolutionary Tribunal which caused the death of eleven of our people in a single day.\u201d \u201cIn that case, Basin, why did you go every week to dine at Chantilly? The Due d\u2019Aumale was just as much the grandson of a member of the Revolutionary Tribunal, with this difference, that Carnot was a brave man and Philippe Egalit\u00e9 a wretched scoundrel.\u201d \u201cExcuse my interrupting you to explain that I did send the photograph,\u201d said Swann. \u201cI can\u2019t understand how it hasn\u2019t reached you.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t altogether surprise me,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cmy servants tell me only what they think fit. They probably do not approve of the Order of Saint John.\u201d And she rang the bell. \u201cYou, know, Oriane, that when I used to go to Chantilly it was without enthusiasm.\u201d \u201cWithout enthusiasm, but with a nightshirt in a bag, in case the Prince asked you to stay, which for that matter he very rarely did, being a perfect cad like all the Orl\u00e9ans lot. Do you know who else are to be dining at Mme. de Saint-Euverte\u2019s?\u201d Mme. de Guermantes asked her husband. \u201cBesides the people you know already, she\u2019s asked at the last moment King Theodosius\u2019s brother.\u201d At these tidings the Duchess\u2019s features breathed contentment and her speech boredom. \u201cOh, good heavens, more princes!\u201d \u201cBut that one is well-mannered and intelligent,\u201d Swann suggested. \u201cNot altogether, though,\u201d replied the Duchess, apparently seeking for words that would give more novelty to the thought expressed. \u201cHave you ever noticed with princes that the best-mannered among them are not really well-mannered? They must always have an opinion about everything. Then, as they have none of their own, they spend the first half of their lives asking us ours and the other half serving it up to us secondhand. They positively must be able to say that one piece has been well played and the next not so well. When there is no difference. Listen, this little Theodosius junior (I forget his name) asked me what one called an orchestral motif. I replied,\u201d said the Duchess, her eyes sparkling while a laugh broke from her beautiful red lips: \u201c\u2018One calls it an orchestral motif.\u2019 I don\u2019t think he was any too well pleased, really. Oh, my dear Charles,\u201d she went on, \u201cwhat a bore it can be, dining out. There are evenings when one would sooner die! It is true that dying may be perhaps just as great a bore, because we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\u201d A servant appeared. It was the young lover who used to have trouble with the porter, until the Duchess, in her kindness of heart, brought about an apparent peace between them. \u201cAm I to go up this evening to inquire for M. le Marquis d\u2019Osmond?\u201d he asked. \u201cMost certainly not, nothing before to-morrow morning. In fact I don\u2019t want you to remain in the house to-night. The only thing that will happen will be that his footman, who knows you, will come to you with the latest report and send you out after us. Get off, go anywhere you like, have a woman, sleep out, but I don\u2019t want to see you here before to-morrow morning.\u201d An immense joy overflowed from the footman\u2019s face. He would at last be able to spend long hours with his ladylove, whom he had practically ceased to see ever since, after a final scene with the porter, the Duchess had considerately explained to him that it would be better, to avoid further conflicts, if he did not go out at all. He floated, at the thought of having an evening free at last, in a happiness which the Duchess saw and guessed its reason. She felt, so to speak, a tightening of the heart and an itching in all her limbs at the sight of this happiness which an amorous couple were snatching behind her back, concealing themselves from her, which left her irritated and jealous. \u201cNo, Basin, let him stay here; I say, he\u2019s not to stir out of the house.\u201d \u201cBut, Oriane, that\u2019s absurd, the house is crammed with servants, and you have the costumier\u2019s people coming as well at twelve to dress us for this show. There\u2019s absolutely nothing for him to do, and he\u2019s the only one who\u2019s a friend of Mama\u2019s footman; I would a thousand times rather get him right away from the house.\u201d \u201cListen, Basin, let me do what I want, I shall have a message for him to take in the evening, as it happens, I can\u2019t tell yet at what time. In any case you\u2019re not to go out of the house for a single instant, do you hear?\u201d she said to the despairing footman. If there were continual quarrels, and if servants did not stay long with the Duchess, the person to whose charge this guerrilla warfare was to be laid was indeed irremovable, but it was not the porter; no doubt for the rougher tasks, for the martyrdoms that it was more tiring to inflict, for the quarrels which ended in blows, the Duchess entrusted the heavier instruments to him; but even then he played his part without the least suspicion that he had been cast for it. Like the household servants, he admired the Duchess for her kindness of heart; and footmen of little discernment who came back, after leaving her service, to visit Fran\u00e7oise used to say that the Duke\u2019s house would have been the finest \u2018place\u2019 in Paris if it had not been for the porter\u2019s lodge. The Duchess \u2018played\u2019 the lodge on them, just as at different times clericalism, freemasonry, the Jewish peril have been played on the public. Another footman came into the room. \u201cWhy have not they brought up the package that M. Swann sent here? And, by the way (you\u2019ve heard, Charles, that Mama is seriously ill?), Jules went up to inquire for news of M. le Marquis d\u2019Osmond: has he come back yet?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s just come this instant, M. le Duc. They\u2019re waiting from one moment to the next for M. le Marquis to pass away.\u201d \u201cAh! He\u2019s alive!\u201d exclaimed the Duke with a sigh of relief. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, that\u2019s all right: sold again, Satan! While there\u2019s life there\u2019s hope,\u201d the Duke announced to us with a joyful air. \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about him as though he were dead and buried. In a week from now he\u2019ll be fitter than I am.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the Doctors who said that he wouldn\u2019t last out the evening. One of them wanted to call again during the night. The head one said it was no use. M. le Marquis would be dead by then; they\u2019ve only kept him alive by injecting him with camphorated oil.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, you damned fool,\u201d cried the Duke in a paroxysm of rage. \u201cWho the devil asked you to say all that? You haven\u2019t understood a word of what they told you.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me they told, it was Jules.\u201d \u201cWill you hold your tongue!\u201d roared the Duke, and, turning to Swann, \u201cWhat a blessing he\u2019s still alive! He will regain his strength gradually, don\u2019t you know. Still alive, after being in such a critical state, that in itself is an excellent sign. One mustn\u2019t expect everything at once. It can\u2019t be at all unpleasant, a little injection of camphorated oil.\u201d He rubbed his hands. \u201cHe\u2019s alive; what more could anyone want? After going through all that he\u2019s gone through, it\u2019s a great step forward. Upon my word, I envy him having such a temperament. Ah! these invalids, you know, people do all sorts of little things for them that they don\u2019t do for us. Now to-day there was a devil of a cook who sent me up a leg of mutton with b\u00e9arnaise sauce \u2014 it was done to a turn, I must admit, but just for that very reason I took so much of it that it\u2019s still lying on my stomach. However, that doesn\u2019t make people come to inquire for me as they do for dear Amanien. We do too much inquiring. It only tires him. We must let him have room to breathe. They\u2019re killing the poor fellow by sending round to him all the time.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said the Duchess to the footman as he was leaving the room, \u201cI gave orders for the envelope containing a photograph which M. Swann sent me to be brought up here.\u201d \u201cMadame la Duchesse, it is so large that I didn\u2019t know if I could get it through the door. We have left it in the hall. Does Madame la Duchesse wish me to bring it up?\u201d \u201cOh, in that case, no; they ought to have told me, but if it\u2019s so big I shall see it in a moment when I come downstairs.\u201d \u201cI forgot to tell Mme. la Duchesse that Mme. la Comtesse Mole left a card this morning for Mme. la Duchesse.\u201d \u201cWhat, this morning?\u201d said the Duchess with an air of disapproval, feeling that so young a woman ought not to take the liberty of leaving cards in the morning. \u201cAbout ten o\u2019clock, Madame la Duchesse.\u201d \u201cShew me the cards.\u201d \u201cIn any case, Oriane, when you say that it was a funny idea on Marie\u2019s part to marry Gilbert,\u201d went on the Duke, reverting to the original topic of conversation, \u201cit is you who have an odd way of writing history. If either of them was a fool, it was Gilbert, for having married of all people a woman so closely related to the King of the Belgians, who has usurped the name of Brabant which belongs to us. To put it briefly, we are of the same blood as the Hesses, and of the elder branch. It is always stupid to talk about oneself,\u201d he apologised to me, \u201cbut after all, whenever we have been not only at Darmstadt, but even at Cassel and all over Electoral Hesse, the Landgraves have always, all of them, been most courteous in giving us precedence as being of the elder branch.\u201d \u201cBut really, Basin, you don\u2019t mean to tell me that a person who was a Major in every regiment in her country, who had been engaged to the King of Sweden . . . \u201d \u201cOriane, that is too much; anyone would think that you didn\u2019t know that the King of Sweden\u2019s grandfather was tilling the soil at Pau when we had been ruling the roost for nine hundred years throughout the whole of Europe.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t alter the fact that if somebody were to say in the street: \u2018Hallo, there\u2019s the King of Sweden,\u2019 everyone would at once rush to see him as far as the Place de la Concorde, and if he said: \u2018There\u2019s M. de Guermantes,\u2019 nobody would know who M. de Guermantes was.\u201d \u201cWhat an argument!\u201d \u201cBesides, I never can understand how, once the title of Duke of Brabant has passed to the Belgian Royal Family, you can continue to claim it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The footman returned with the Comtesse Mole\u2019s card, or rather what she had left in place of a card. Alleging that she had none on her, she had taken from her pocket a letter addressed to herself, and keeping the contents had handed in the envelope which bore the inscription: \u2018La Comtesse Mole.\u2019 As the envelope was rather large, following the fashion in notepaper which prevailed that year, this manuscript \u2018card\u2019 was almost twice the size of an ordinary visiting card. \u201cThat is what people call Mme. Mole\u2019s \u2018simplicity,\u2019\u201d said the Duchess ironically. \u201cShe wants to make us think that she had no cards on her, and to shew her originality. But we know all about that, don\u2019t we, my little Charles, we are quite old enough and quite original enough ourselves to see through the tricks of a little lady who has only been going about for four years. She is charming, but she doesn\u2019t seem to me, all the same, to be quite \u2018big\u2019 enough to imagine that she can take the world by surprise with so little effort as merely leaving an envelope instead of a card and leaving it at ten o\u2019clock in the morning. Her old mother mouse will shew her that she knows a thing or two about that.\u201d Swann could not help smiling at the thought that the Duchess, who was, incidentally, a trifle jealous of Mme. Mole\u2019s success, would find it quite in accordance with the \u2018Guermantes wit\u2019 to make some impertinent retort to her visitor. \u201cSo far as the title of Duc de Brabant is concerned, I\u2019ve told you a hundred times, Oriane . . . \u201d the Duke continued, but the Duchess, without listening, cut him short. \u201cBut, my little Charles, I\u2019m longing to see your photograph.\u201d \u201cAh! Extinctor draconis latrator Anubis,\u201d said Swann. \u201cYes, it was so charming what you said about that when you were comparing the Saint George at Venice. But I don\u2019t understand: why Anubis?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the one like who was an ancestor of Babal?\u201d asked M. de Guermantes. \u201cYou want to see his bauble?\u201d retorted his wife, dryly, to shew she herself scorned the pun. \u201cI want to see them all,\u201d she added. \u201cListen, Charles, let us wait downstairs till the carriage comes,\u201d said the Duke; \u201cyou can pay your call on us in the hall, because my wife won\u2019t let us have any peace until she\u2019s seen your photograph. I am less impatient, I must say,\u201d he added with a satisfied air. \u201cI am not easily moved myself, but she would see us all dead rather than miss it.\u201d \u201cI am entirely of your opinion, Basin,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201clet us go into the hall; we shall at least know why we have come down from your study, while we shall never know how we have come down from the Counts of Brabant.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve told you a hundred times how the title came into the House of Hesse,\u201d said the Duke (while we were going downstairs to look at the photograph, and I thought of those that Swann used to bring me at Combray), \u201cthrough the marriage of a Brabant in 1241 with the daughter of the last Landgrave of Thuringia and Hesse, so that really it is the title of Prince of Hesse that came to the House of Brabant rather than that of Duke of Brabant to the House of Hesse. You will remember that our battle-cry was that of the Dukes of Brabant: \u2018Limbourg to her conqueror!\u2019 until we exchanged the arms of Brabant for those of Guermantes, in which I think myself that we were wrong, and the example of the Gramonts will not make me change my opinion.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cas it is the King of the Belgians who is the conqueror . . . Besides the Belgian Crown Prince calls himself Duc de Brabant.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear child, your argument will not hold water for a moment. You know as well as I do that there are titles of pretension which can perfectly well exist even if the territory is occupied by usurpers. For instance, the King of Spain describes himself equally as Duke of Brabant, claiming in virtue of a possession less ancient than ours, but more ancient than that of the King of the Belgians. He calls himself also Duke of Burgundy, King of the Indies Occidental and Oriental, and Duke of Milan. Well, he is no more in possession of Burgundy, the Indies or Brabant than I possess Brabant myself, or the Prince of Hesse either, for that matter. The King of Spain likewise proclaims himself King of Jerusalem, as does the Austrian Emperor, and Jerusalem belongs to neither one nor the other.\u201d He stopped for a moment with an awkward feeling that the mention of Jerusalem might have embarrassed Swann, in view of \u2018current events,\u2019 but only went on more rapidly: \u201cWhat you said just now might be said of anyone. We were at one time Dukes of Aumale, a duchy that has passed as regularly to the House of France as Joinville and Chevreuse have to the House of Albert. We make no more claim to those titles than to that of Marquis de Noirmoutiers, which was at one time ours, and became perfectly regularly the appanage of the House of La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, but because certain cessions are valid, it does not follow that they all are. For instance,\u201d he went on, turning to me, \u201cmy sister-in-law\u2019s son bears the title of Prince d\u2019Agrigente, which comes to us from Joan the Mad, as that of Prince de Tarente comes to the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles. Well, Napoleon went and gave this title of Tarente to a soldier, who may have been admirable in the ranks, but in doing so the Emperor was disposing of what belonged to him even less than Napoleon III when he created a Duc de Montmorency, since P\u00e9rigord had at least a mother who was a Montmorency, while the Tarente of Napoleon I had no more Tarente about him than Napoleon\u2019s wish that he should become so. That did not prevent Chaix d\u2019Est-Ange, alluding to our uncle Cond\u00e9, from asking the Procurer Imp\u00e9rial if he had picked up the title of Duc de Montmorency in the moat of Vincennes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, Basin, I ask for nothing better than to follow you to the ditches of Vincennes, or even to Tarante. And that reminds me, Charles, of what I was going to say to you when you were telling me about your Saint George at Venice. We have an idea, Basin and I, of spending next spring in Italy and Sicily. If you were to come with us, just think what a difference it would make! I\u2019m not thinking only of the pleasure of seeing you, but imagine, after all you\u2019ve told me so often about the remains of the Norman Conquest and of ancient history, imagine what a trip like that would become if you came with us! I mean to say that even Basin \u2014 what am I saying, Gilbert \u2014 would benefit by it, because I feel that even his claims to the throne of Naples and all that sort of thing would interest me if they were explained by you in old romanesque churches in little villages perched on hills like primitive paintings. But now we\u2019re going to look at your photograph. Open the envelope,\u201d said the Duchess to a footman. \u201cPlease, Oriane, not this evening; you can look at it to-morrow,\u201d implored the Duke, who had already been making signs of alarm to me on seeing the huge size of the photograph. \u201cBut I like to look at it with Charles,\u201d said the Duchess, with a smile at once artificially concupiscent and psychologically subtle, for in her desire to be friendly to Swann she spoke of the pleasure which she would have in looking at the photograph as though it were the pleasure an invalid feels he would find in eating an orange, or as though she had managed to combine an escapade with her friends with giving information to a biographer as to some of her favourite pursuits. \u201cAll right, he will come again to see you, on purpose,\u201d declared the Duke, to whom his wife was obliged to yield. \u201cYou can spend three hours in front of it, if that amuses you,\u201d he added ironically. \u201cBut where are you going to stick a toy of those dimensions?\u201d \u201cWhy, in my room, of course. I like to have it before my eyes.\u201d \u201cOh, just as you please; if it\u2019s in your room, probably I shall never see it,\u201d said the Duke, without thinking of the revelation he was thus blindly making of the negative character of his conjugal relations. \u201cVery well, you will undo it with the greatest care,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes told the servant, multiplying her instructions out of politeness to Swann. \u201cAnd see that you don\u2019t crumple the envelope, either.\u201d \u201cSo even the envelope has got to be respected!\u201d the Duke murmured to me, raising his eyes to the ceiling. \u201cBut, Swann,\u201d he added, \u201cI, who am only a poor married man and thoroughly prosaic, what I wonder at is how on earth you managed to find an envelope that size. Where did you pick it up?\u201d \u201cOh, at the photographer\u2019s; they\u2019re always sending out things like that. But the man is a fool, for I see he\u2019s written on it \u2018The Duchesse de Guermantes,\u2019 without putting \u2018Madame.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll forgive him for that,\u201d said the Duchess carelessly; then, seeming to be struck by a sudden idea which enlivened her, checked a faint smile; but at once returning to Swann: \u201cWell, you don\u2019t say whether you\u2019re coming to Italy with us?\u201d \u201cMadame, I am really afraid that it will not be possible.\u201d \u201cIndeed! Mme. de Montmorency is more fortunate. You went with her to Venice and Vicenza. She told me that with you one saw things one would never see otherwise, things no one had ever thought of mentioning before, that you shewed her things she had never dreamed of, and that even in the well-known things she had been able to appreciate details which without you she might have passed by a dozen times without ever noticing. Obviously, she has been more highly favoured than we are to be. . . . You will take the big envelope from M. Swann\u2019s photograph,\u201d she said to the servant, \u201cand you will hand it in, from me, this evening at half past ten at Mme. la Comtesse Mole\u2019s.\u201d Swann laughed. \u201cI should like to know, all the same,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes asked him, \u201chow, ten months before the time, you can tell that a thing will be impossible.\u201d \u201cMy dear Duchess, I will tell you if you insist upon it, but, first of all, you can see that I am very ill.\u201d \u201cYes, my little Charles, I don\u2019t think you look at all well. I\u2019m not pleased with your colour, but I\u2019m not asking you to come with me next week, I ask you to come in ten months. In ten months one has time to get oneself cured, you know.\u201d At this point a footman came in to say that the carriage was at the door. \u201cCome, Oriane, to horse,\u201d said the Duke, already pawing the ground with impatience as though he were himself one of the horses that stood waiting outside. \u201cVery well, give me in one word the reason why you can\u2019t come to Italy,\u201d the Duchess put it to Swann as she rose to say good-bye to us. \u201cBut, my dear friend, it\u2019s because I shall then have been dead for several months. According to the doctors I consulted last winter, the thing I\u2019ve got \u2014 which may, for that matter, carry me off at any moment \u2014 won\u2019t in any case leave me more than three or four months to live, and even that is a generous estimate,\u201d replied Swann with a smile, while the footman opened the glazed door of the hall to let the Duchess out. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you say?\u201d cried the Duchess, stopping for a moment on her way to the carriage, and raising her fine eyes, their melancholy blue clouded by uncertainty. Placed for the first time in her life between two duties as incompatible as getting into her carriage to go out to dinner and shewing pity for a man who was about to die, she could find nothing in the code of conventions that indicated the right line to follow, and, not knowing which to choose, felt it better to make a show of not believing that the latter alternative need be seriously considered, so as to follow the first, which demanded of her at the moment less effort, and thought that the best way of settling the conflict would be to deny that any existed. \u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d she said to Swann. \u201cIt would be a joke in charming taste,\u201d replied he ironically. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I am telling you this; I have never said a word to you before about my illness. But as you asked me, and as now I may die at any moment . . . But whatever I do I mustn\u2019t make you late; you\u2019re dining out, remember,\u201d he added, because he knew that for other people their own social obligations took precedence of the death of a friend, and could put himself in her place by dint of his instinctive politeness. But that of the Duchess enabled her also to perceive in a vague way that the dinner to which she was going must count for less to Swann than his own death. And so, while continuing on her way towards the carriage, she let her shoulders droop, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about our dinner. It\u2019s not of any importance!\u201d But this put the Duke in a bad humour, who exclaimed: \u201cCome, Oriane, don\u2019t stop there chattering like that and exchanging your jeremiads with Swann; you know very well that Mme. de Saint-Euverte insists on sitting down to table at eight o\u2019clock sharp. We must know what you propose to do; the horses have been waiting for a good five minutes. I beg your pardon, Charles,\u201d he went on, turning to Swann, \u201cbut it\u2019s ten minutes to eight already. Oriane is always late, and it will take us more than five minutes to get to old Saint-Euverte\u2019s.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes advanced resolutely towards the carriage and uttered a last farewell to Swann. \u201cYou know, we can talk about that another time; I don\u2019t believe a word you\u2019ve been saying, but we must discuss it quietly. I expect they gave you a dreadful fright, come to luncheon, whatever day you like\u201d (with Mme. de Guermantes things always resolved themselves into luncheons), \u201cyou will let me know your day and time,\u201d and, lifting her red skirt, she set her foot on the step. She was just getting into the carriage when, seeing this foot exposed, the Duke cried in a terrifying voice: \u201cOriane, what have you been thinking of, you wretch? You\u2019ve kept on your black shoes! With a red dress! Go upstairs quick and put on red shoes, or rather,\u201d he said to the footman, \u201ctell the lady\u2019s maid at once to bring down a pair of red shoes.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear,\u201d replied the Duchess gently, annoyed to see that Swann, who was leaving the house with me but had stood back to allow the carriage to pass out in front of us, could hear, \u201csince we are late.\u201d \u201cNo, no, we have plenty of time. It is only ten to; it won\u2019t take us ten minutes to get to the Parc Monceau. And, after all, what would it matter? If we turned up at half past eight they\u2019d have to wait for us, but you can\u2019t possibly go there in a red dress and black shoes. Besides, we shan\u2019t be the last, I can tell you; the Sassenages are coming, and you know they never arrive before twenty to nine.\u201d The Duchess went up to her room. \u201cWell,\u201d said M. de Guermantes to Swann and myself, \u201cwe poor, down-trodden husbands, people laugh at us, but we are of some use all the same. But for me, Oriane would have been going out to dinner in black shoes.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not unbecoming,\u201d said Swann, \u201cI noticed the black shoes and they didn\u2019t offend me in the least.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t say you\u2019re wrong,\u201d replied the Duke, \u201cbut it looks better to have them to match the dress. Besides, you needn\u2019t worry, she would no sooner have got there than she\u2019d have noticed them, and I should have been obliged to come home and fetch the others. I should have had my dinner at nine o\u2019clock. Good-bye, my children,\u201d he said, thrusting us gently from the door, \u201cget away, before Oriane comes down again. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t like seeing you both. On the contrary, she\u2019s too fond of your company. If she finds you still here she will start talking again, she is tired out already, she\u2019ll reach the dinner-table quite dead. Besides, I tell you frankly, I\u2019m dying of hunger. I had a wretched luncheon this morning when I came from the train. There was the devil of a b\u00e9arnaise sauce, I admit, but in spite of that I shan\u2019t be at all sorry, not at all sorry to sit down to dinner. Five minutes to eight! Oh, women, women! She\u2019ll give us both indigestion before to-morrow. She is not nearly as strong as people think.\u201d The Duke felt no compunction at speaking thus of his wife\u2019s ailments and his own to a dying man, for the former interested him more, appeared to him more important. And so it was simply from good breeding and good fellowship that, after politely shewing us out, he cried \u2018from off stage,\u2019 in a stentorian voice from the porch to Swann, who was already in the courtyard: \u201cYou, now, don\u2019t let yourself be taken in by the doctors\u2019 nonsense, damn them. They\u2019re donkeys. You\u2019re as strong as the Pont Neuf. You\u2019ll live to bury us all!\u201dEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1536958", "artist_names": "Johnny & The Hurricanes", "full_title": "Ja-Da

"Fire in the Booth Lyrics[Intro: Charlie Sloth & Doc Brown]\nYou know what time it is when you hear this right\nHahaha, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Doc Brown]\nOi Charlie, I'm overdue a Fire in the Booth\nI'm a dude with desire for the truth\nFrom when I was a youth with a army in Willesden\nKept it North-West like a Kanye christening\nAren't they listening?\nWhat, you thought I wasn't OG?\nOr maybe thought I rap about tea\nWay before the comedy, I was there slewing MC's\nYou could say I've got master degrees\nBars were for free, now I charge them a fee\nTwenty-five large if you're asking a P\nDoc's harder fam, I rep it when the drop come\nGodfather from before I had a godson\nDo your history, Charlie knows\nI used to be the yout' with the party flows\nBack when they called me the host with the most\nDeal, wheel, jump off, had them on toast\nYo, let me give you the facts\nI'm a man that was born with the gift of the gab\nI could get out of any fix with a chat\nHm, I've got Kilburn to thank for that\nSee I grew up broke as a joke, no cash\nStill had bare peng chicks on smash\nBruv, thank God I got wifed up\nI'd be messing like thirty girls' lives up\nYo Sloth, turn my mic up\nNo surprise these guys don't like us\nSome man just hate success\nEspecially from a couple North-Weezy vets\nMe, I'm bless\nI never got handed shit, I worked like the proverbial bitch\nSpitting when I was knee high\nNever see me try say I was all about the street life\nI was never one of them dudes banging\nTrue of course I knew a few loose cannons\nCouple shooters that'd move for me\nI couldn't bring them man around the BBC\nMan's on Live at the Apollo, Russell Howard's Good News\nThat ain't what crooks do\nPart of the fire that I bring to the booth\nIs a eulogy for all the kids that'll lose\nDon't know why my comedy shows are so dope?\nBecause the blocks that I left behind are no joke\nOh, I forgot to mention\nI already filled up the pot for pension\nMy real soldiers in my will and testament\nI don't know you and still you're begging it\nSpent ten years out of the game\nStill got more flames than half these names\nI just listen and laugh, he's bait\nThink he got the wildest flow out, he's tame\nHot album coming, I can hardly wait\nNo refunds and you can't exchange\nIf you attempt to try poison\nTry go against my brothers and destroy them\nI'll rain down on you with great vengeance and furious anger\nCall me a prankster\nCall me a clown, it's true\nI'll goof off and still rinse you\nThe code you break when you rhyme is the peakest\nDon't mistake my kindness for weakness\nMy man are ferocious\nYou man are atrocious\nSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious\nGet it popping like Mary\nNo shit you man like Van Dyke, you know dick\nSo quick to assume that I'm old hat\nNo match for the vocab in my notepad\nDon't front for me with no gonads\nI'm the opposite of front, you know, back\nBlap, Doc, what\n[Interlude: Doc Brown & Charlie Sloth]\nOi, man like Doc Brown you know\nI'm glad to see you've still got it G\nFire\nWhat he at? What he at? Woof\nJeez\nOh my gosh, didn't even break a sweat\nOh my days\nStill breathing as well\nRah, ah it feels good, it feels good to be back\nMan like Doc Brown\nJeez\nWe going again yeah?\nOi, let's go again, let's go again\nLet's slow this shit down\nAlright, yes\nLet's get 'em Doc\nFire, oi, listen, it go\nUh, like that, this beat's by my brother Last Skeptik, shout out The Last Skeptik, my man\nEvery time\nEvery time\nOi, this is, this is some real shit right here, I thought I'd slow it down so everybody catches it\nBecause I know like some people might think it's a bit embarrassing that I'm back, pushing forty and all that but check it, you know what, I fun it up\n\n[Verse 2: Doc Brown]\nI'm an embarrassment\nA thirty something dad who look like one of The Establishment\nCan't believe I'm rapping and my daughter's looking awkward at her friends - \"shit, it's dad again\"\nJust pretend this isn't happening\nEmbarrasing, yeah, making packed lunches and sandwiches\nThis nigga probably got a camper van\nBut more embarrassing's the fact that I can still savage rappers, any persuasion, Caucasian, Asian or African\nGot the kind of flow to blow the smoke out the Vatican\nI realise everything I dream, you're imagining\nSpeaking of embarrassment\nWhat your girl's messaging me all the time is borderline sexual harassment\nMan, I'll have to get restraining orders for ya\nSaw you try and draw before but this time, I'm closing the door\nIf chicks are too thirsty, man are too hungry\nI spit so crisp, biters try to Monster Munch me\nTrump me like the leader of the free world, ugly\nPost-apocalypse, all cockroaches and just me\nIt's impossible to fathom my train of thought\nYou ain't been near a career this strange before\nYou could see me on a screen, a stage, a tour\nWhen I perform, what you see's the same, I'm raw\nSipping on Dom champs with Tom Hanks\nCricklewood on my mind, my donny's running with the wrong gangs\nYou could take the boy out of North-Weezy\nBut this shit run deep blud, believe me\nWho you tryna break fam?\nGetting it popping with Jennifer Lawrence, honestly, Hollywood didn't break man\nStill rocking with the same fam\nA poisonous pack of guys, glad to sacrifice a wasteman\nDying planet and a lot of dead stars\nCry behind your Prada glasses, I gave you a head-start\nBeen out the game nine years, seven months, three weeks, six days\nAnd you still ain't got shit to say\nI create the bait when I conversate, articulate\nTry shift me but you can't lift the weight\nHeavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy monster sound\nNo more soft songs allowed\nWrite a book on that 'cause looking back, of course I'm proud\nWith a venue and a pencil, I can draw a crowd\nAnd fame will never mean as much as money\nBut money will never ever mean as much as the love does cuzzy\nSo sprinkle some respect on my name like fine seasoning\nWork it out, I'm the reason and you're reasoning\nYou might also like[Outro: Doc Brown & Charlie Sloth]\nAnd that's some Fire in the Booth right there\nAy, ay, man like Doc Brown, jeez\nHahaha, Doc Brown, your worst nightmare, I'm back fam, simple tings\nPull that\nBro\nShit\nYou are still the same guy that I listened to back in the day, like this guy is so sick man\nAh man, ah I appreciate it bro\nHe's so sick bro\nThank you, thank you\nAnd that right there, that right there is what you call Fire in the Booth\nSafe bruvEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1637187", "artist_names": "Freddie King", "full_title": "You've Got to Love Her With a Feeling

\u201cAmerican Recordings\u201d (33 1/3 excerpt) LyricsChapter Seven \u2013 DeliaAt his best, Cash manipulated his cultural inheritance so it felt immediate\u2014a kind of confession. Likewise, his finest personal numbers are animated by a spirit larger than any particular self, expanding those songs beyond the usual boundaries of self and public, spirit and self. In Cash\u2019s strongest recordings, the voice comes on as more than a single personality\u2019s self-expression; it sounds more like some buried address, a grand cavernous restless place consenting to song. More expansive than an individualized perspective, this plundering transcendence is Cash\u2019s oddly singular possession\n\nThe novelist Barry Hannah, when interviewing Cash for a feature in Spin shortly after the release of American Recordings, noted how its lead track and single, \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone,\u201d was an especially vicious, -frightening number. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a criminal, be a criminal,\u201d Cash responded. \u201cIf you want to sing God\u2019s praises, sing His Praises!\u201d That\u2019s one approach. \u201cAvoid extremes,\u201d Benjamin Franklin once wrote, prescribing a different path. \u201cForbear resenting -injuries as much as you think they deserve.\u201d Cash bore a different credo. His impulses\u2014like his injuries and grievances\u2014existed in order to carry him, out beyond any middle ground of acceptable behavior. \u201cEat and carouse with Bacchus, or munch dry bread with Jesus,\u201d D. H. Lawrence wrote in direct redress of Franklin, \u201cbut don\u2019t sit down without one of the gods.\u201d To court the attendance of the gods is not only to invite salvation and reconciliation to one\u2019s feast but also plagues of terror and dissension. \u201cKill when you must, and be killed the same,\u201d Lawrence also wrote, \u201cthe must coming from the gods inside you, or from the men in whom you recognize the Holy Ghost.\u201d\n\nThere is no point in resting at Cash\u2019s intentions with \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d or to merely parse the literal content of the lyrics in order to judge and admonish their excesses. It was forged in a fire larger than Cash\u2019s own. But we can\u2019t leave Cash\u2019s life out of the calculation of our response either. As a late and inexplicable issue of the American folk tradition, \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d is not a self-contained parcel of meanings to be stored and retrieved and closely read in isolation, in a kind of metaphysical autopsy. It is its own history and tributary, fed by sweat, piss, jizz and blood. The song channels forces grander than the possession of any earthly self and, before it can really be discussed, those forces have to be felt. This is how it appears to be with great art. We can begin to speak truthfully of it only once it has struck us dumb\n\n*\u2003*\u2003*\n\nThe commingled blood of love and murder has darkened centuries of American song, of course, from \u201cThe Banks of the Ohio\u201d to \u201cFrankie and Johnny\u201d to \u201cGoodbye Earl.\u201d A key gets slipped into such songs, unlocking questions of action and consequence. What are the acts one must mortgage with one\u2019s own life? A girl is killed and tossed into the Ohio River because she will not marry; Johnny cheats on Frankie, so she shoots him, rooty-toot-toot, through the bedroom door; and because he pummels her into intensive care, Earl\u2019s wife and her pal extract his life as payment. Each song leads its listener to a threshold that should not have been crossed, and that threshold is never the same. It is not just simple sensationalism or vicarious cruelty feeding interest in these songs, generation after generation; they are parables, set in common language. Fifty years ago, a group of Minneapolis street-corner troubadours, The Blenders, spelled it out for us: you can play around all you want with TNT, you can go grab a tiger by its tail, but you better not fuck around with love\n\nIf Cash had not murdered Delia, he would have married her. As a vow with the eternal, either act would have sufficed. It is mind courting myth, seeking a sufficient measure, in love and in justice. The folk antihero Stagger Lee grew legendary, song-worthy, because he killed Billy Lyons for taking Lee\u2019s hat off his head. What lent this murder a mythic weight was not the extinguishing of Lyons\u2019 particular life for such paltry behavior; any other fool could have stumbled forward out of anonymity and stepped into Lyons\u2019 shoes and the song would not have lost an ounce of significance. The song is notable, recurring, because of the murderous transaction that occurred as a result of the absolute value Stagger Lee placed on style. Lyons, playing the rube, found himself trapped in a web of correspondences he did not understand. A bait and switch occurred. He took a bad man\u2019s Stetson hat without knowing what it meant. Taking my hat, Stagger Lee\u2019s moral calculus concluded, is the same as putting a bullet hole in your guts. How was Lyons supposed to know that all of the pride and vanity a man normally places on the fidelity of his woman, that entire burden of identity, Stagger Lee had transferred to the pimpish arrangement of felt atop his head?\nIn dealing with a song that moves through myth, literal truths can only get us inside its labyrinth of correspondences. We have to find our own way once we\u2019re in there. \u201cIt\u2019s not an anti-woman song,\u201d Cash announced in concert. \u201cIt\u2019s just an anti-Delia song.\u201d Who was this Delia that he ended up crooning about, this lover he tied down in a parlor and filled up with lead? Was she the sensual embodiment of some spiritual fact? A temptress crouched on the lower throne of Cash\u2019s psyche? A sound circling the earth? She was just a woman; trifling, low and mean. She was promiscuous. When Waylon Jennings sang about her, she was as mysterious as a house in New Orleans. She wanted to kill him, too. She gambled and cursed her man (if her fella hadn\u2019t shot her she\u2019d have cursed him worse). In the Kingston Trio\u2019s \u201cOne More Round,\u201d Delia was a girl who had slipped out the back door and was headed now to marble town, laid low at some stranger\u2019s hands. According to Johnny Western, Delia died immediately when her Tony shot her and then she bowed her head; they dressed her up in brown and let her settle back into the earth. Scores of twentieth century recordings describing young Delia\u2019s murder exist, relics of an irretrievable, unshakable American past. For Blind Willie McTell, Delia was just one more citizen gone to the graveyard; her murderous lover was sentenced to stay in his prison cell until she came back to life\n\nShe did not stay in the graveyard long. Delia migrated, in song, to the Bahamas sometime in the 1920s and then returned, in altered form, to America in the 1950s, in the recordings of Blind Blake Alphonso Harris, Harry Belafonte and others. The Delia that Cash knew, the one that he first sang about\u2014not on American Recordings but on a record released thirty years earlier\u2014was the Delia who emigrated back to America, not the Delia who was slain here. Cash cultivated the Bahamian strain of the Delia legend. In a certain sense, she was already a ghost when he met her\n\nOn his initial recording of \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d on The Sound of Johnny Cash, released in 1962, Cash played it straight, devoting more attention to the legal consequences of the crime than to the act itself. In the opening verses, the plot matches up with the later, more famous American Recordings version. But the last three verses of this earlier version move quickly away from the scene of the crime in order to focus on the killer\u2019s sentencing. In these verses, the singer declares that he\u2019s not going to reveal his verdict to the listener because, vaguely, he\u2019s \u201cgot a brother in Memphis doing life or 99.\u201d\n\nOn the calypso version of \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d recorded a decade earlier by Blind Blake, the song\u2019s narrator presented a Tony who killed his Delia because of a wicked curse and who believed his sentence of sixty-four years was not so bad because his little brother was serving one that was worse, spanning nine hundred and ninety-nine years. Cash, lifting this version\u2019s sentiment while also attempting to re-Americanize the song, inserted Memphis as a marginal coordinate for the tale, but produced a confused jumble in doing so. The song trots forward anyway, and Cash notes how he is haunted by Delia\u2019s ghost, almost in afterthought. The last glimpse the song gives is of the singer busting rocks on a chain gang, hearing Delia\u2019s name with the splitting of each stone, the song\u2019s lone mythic resonance; the story ends and the singer does not find himself asking any questions, though the earth keeps repeating its one answer anyway, over and over again\n\nReplicating much of the lyrical content of Blind Blake\u2019s decade-old import, which itself was a revision of a decades-old American ballad, Cash ended up not only re-Americanizing the song but also casting it in the first person, from the killer\u2019s point of view, as a guiltless confession. In doing so, Cash also ended up retaining the distant, uninvested voice of a third-person reporter, even though he was now singing the song from the killer\u2019s perspective. Delia is dead and her killer is punished, but no motives or even emotions seem to have occurred. In most non-Cashian versions of the Delia legend, the story has been told from a relatively objective point of view, as a kind of reportage; a Tony or a Coony or some other lover shoots Delia after a particular transgression, usually either cursing or cheating. On Blind Blake\u2019s seminal version, for instance, the narrator presents the facts of the Delia case line by line, and is then joined by a chorale of men on the \u201cDelia\u2019s gone, one more round, Delia\u2019s gone\u201d refrain, a refrain absent from the pre-Bahamian, early American folk instantiations of the song\n\nBlind Blake\u2019s version sounds like a party or tavern gathering, a community granting authority and witness to the account; a group of men have collected together, to share a local story. In this story, Delia\u2019s killer gets arrested, and then is sentenced the next day. The listener realizes, as the story unfolds, that both Delia and Tony are now outside the geography of the song: one is in a prison cell drinking from a silver cup, the other is in the graveyard, never to get up. They can be described by the song but they do not contribute to it. It is neither Delia nor her killer who will persist after the song\u2019s completion but rather the community from which they were extracted using many of the same words as Blind Blake, Cash tells a very different story. In his 1962 version, he is joined not by fellow storytellers but rather by the slick and deathless background singers of the period, who lend their studio-approved mmmmms and aaaaahhhs to the narration, softening the rawness of Cash\u2019s voice. They join the refrain, not as co-owners of the story but as a sort of mindless aural gauze, seemingly unaware of the mayhem they are soundtracking. And it is unclear as to whom Cash and the background singers are addressing; fellow prisoners perhaps, or maybe Delia\u2019s memory (perhaps the song is meant to chime continuously with the split rocks as the singer does his hard time). No sense of community or collectivity is present in Cash\u2019s song. In his first version, the song is simply the story of a domestic murder and its expected, corresponding punishment. One suspects the song would largely be forgotten, would deserve to be forgotten, if it were not the prelude to the late, acoustic, solitary version on *American Recordings* that brought Cash back into the national consciousness. His first version is a song without motive, emotion or cosmic consequence, a slice of representative sound from the period, but a bit hollow, a little overadorned\n\n*\u2003*\u2003*\n\n\u201cMine wasn\u2019t soft-core, pop-psychology self-hatred,\u201d Cash would write in his second autobiography, \u201cit was a profound, violent, daily holocaust of revulsion and shame.\u201d \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d displays a violent and primary mechanism in Cash\u2019s life, a violence of ancient pedigree and Old Testament reckoning, and is similarly the issue of a collective mindset\u2014the American folk tradition\u2014prepared to accept a world in which sons and daughters are punished for the sins of their forefathers, in which men and women are cut down for shadowy transgressions, because it recognizes that justice and retribution are forces larger than the life spans of the individual players involved. The playground of demons and angels, tyrants and totems, such a mindset assumes our lives are rarely our own. \u201cSee all men and women according to the Holy Ghost that is within them,\u201d D. H. Lawrence wrote. \u201cNever yield before the barren.\u201d To such a mind, we each are unmoored in eternity, inside the half-known. The thread by which we are cradled\u2014call it necessity or morality or love\u2014is not to be corrupted; it is what holds us above an oblivious pool\n\nFleeing the barren, Cash turned to unsuspected quarters for nourishment. Regardless of what the movies say, it was not just simple beneficence that led Cash to sing prisoner songs or to perform for actual convicts, singing them back home. When he played at places such as Folsom Prison and San Quentin, Cash\u2019s songs tapped into the repressed and wicked impulses pulsing beneath violently composed behaviors. He appeared in these settings like he appears in the imagination, not just as a relief but as a furious revelation. Bob Johnston, Cash\u2019s producer at the time, recalled the prison show that resulted in Live at San Quentin and the defiant, damning song that Cash wrote for the occasion: \u201cSan Quentin,\u201d Cash slurred at the end of the song, \u201cmay you rot and burn in Hell.\u201d He played it twice. \u201cIt was surprising,\u201d Johnston told Michael Streissguth, \u201cbecause Johnny said, \u2018When I sang it again and all of a sudden I looked around and I knew that if I wanted to let those people go all I had to do was say \u2018The time is now.\u2019 And all of those prisoners would\u2019ve broken.\u2019\u201d Performing with his wife and friends, Cash nearly orchestrated a massacre. On the second pass through \u201cSan Quentin,\u201d the spooked guards began aiming their guns at the prisoners who were climbing onto the tables and threatening to riot, responding to Cash\u2019s damnation of their prison. \u201cAll he had to do was say something,\u201d Johnston recalled. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been a huge riot, and Johnny and all his family would\u2019ve been dead out there.\u201d\n\nHow did Cash regard the potential abyss that opened before him? Did he find himself repelled by its invitation? \u201cI was tempted,\u201d he told Johnston, afterwards. Songs like \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d were not far from the strum of Cash\u2019s own being. He had started playing San Quentin in the 1950s, when a young felon\u2014one with a spider-web tattooed across his back because, as one of his wives would later put it, he felt trapped inside his own body\u2014named Merle Haggard was among the incarcerated. \u201cThere was a connection there,\u201d Haggard later said, remembering Cash\u2019s performance, \u201can identification.\u201d It was an identification not only with the contours and impulses of the criminal psyche but also with the pieties of the prisoner, of one who acutely knows the limits and capacities of the self\n\nAfter the resurrection of his career that the prison albums triggered, Cash met with Delia again, during the first season of his ABC television program. Introduced as that episode\u2019s \u201clove song,\u201d Cash performed \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d with a feral irreverence, his eyes flashing in delight when singing about shooting Delia and watching her die. In this performance, instead of the confused lines from the 1962 version about his prison sentence and a brother in Memphis, Cash inserted a familiar motive into the song. \u201cI saw my backdoor open, ran and looked outside,\u201d Cash sang. \u201cI knew she was gone to meet him, durn her mangy hide.\u201d Seven years after his initial attempt, at the height of his fame, Cash was beginning to veer his account of Delia toward the mix of video-game violence and bemused stoicism that would make his American Recordings version so -compelling. In this 1969 version, Cash\u2019s killer formulated his own bizarro vocabulary (\u201cdurn,\u201d \u201cmangy hide\u201d), caricaturing his violence with one hand but chiseling out a killer\u2019s condescension with the other; from a later perspective, this odd new lyric reads as a test run for the equally odd and ominous \u201csub-mo-chine\u201d of Cash\u2019s final version\n\nThe humor was played too broadly on this earlier television performance, however, to have the violence register as immanent to our world\u2014it sounds like a distant occurrence in some other, even more cartoonish world\u2014though we do begin to sense the killer\u2019s aloofness, his sadistic pose of claustrophobic self-regard. The killer gleam in Cash\u2019s eyes is in fact the most chilling element of the performance, outstripping even his laconic vocals; it may have been the most authentic remnant of the Delia legend to attach itself to this, or any other, version Cash would endeavor. \u201cA love song!\u201d Cash called to the band at the end the song, still delighted\n\n*\u2003*\u2003*\nThere had been an actual Delia\n\nBack before Cash was even plucked from whatever obscure fold in the cosmos and thrust onto the swampy Arkansas loam, back in the era of Frankie hunting down Johnny and the fiery death of Casey Jones\u2014heralds of the oncoming age, feed for the folksy fables of unsuspecting generations\u2014young Delia had lived. Afterwards, they would say that her murderer was as drunk as a lord when he walked in through the front door of the home of Willie and Emma West on Christmas Eve night in the black section of Savannah, Georgia in 1900. We do know that everyone was loaded, slumped around the piano, gathered and leaning into song. A new century hid before them. \u201cWhen my eye-strings break in death,\u201d they were singing, \u201cwhen I soar to worlds unknown.\u201d These were the words pouring forth from their chosen spiritual, \u201cRock of Ages.\u201d Delia Green was also there in the stupor, bright as a berry in her brand new dress. \u201cLet me hide myself in Thee,\u201d they sang. Christmas was coming and Delia was fourteen years of age when her lover, also just fourteen, came slouching into the room with a gun in his hand\n\nFor a century, only ballads told the tale. But ten years ago, acting on a tip that the actual Delia\u2019s murder occurred in Savannah either in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, a University of Georgia professor named John Garst turned to newspaper records for a lead. To narrow his search, Garst first began skimming through documented versions of the song, scanning its endless variations, looking for clues that would date the original crime. In Chapman J. Milling\u2019s 1937 article in Southern Folklore Quarterly, \u201cDelia Holmes \u2014 a Neglected Negro Ballad,\u201d Garst discovered the following verses:Nineteen hundred\nNineteen hundred and one;\nDeath of po\u2019 Delia\nHas jes\u2019 now begun\nNineteen hundred\nNineteen hundred and two;\nDeath of po\u2019 Delia\nJes\u2019 now come true\nNineteen hundred\nNineteen hundred and three\nAll those darkies singin\u2019\nNearer my God to Thee.Garst began looking through the microfilm archives of the Savannah newspapers for the year 1901, to see what the ballad\u2019s darkies were singing about. Within a couple of hours he found reports from the trial of a Moses Houston, charged with killing a young Savannah girl named Delia. None of the early Delia variations pinned the murder on a Moses or Mose however\u2014her killer was often some variation on the name Coony (or later, Tony)\u2014so it was unclear whether the Delia that Moses Houston killed was the Delia of the ballads. Looking at papers from around the date of Houston\u2019s accused crime, Garst eventually came across the -following headline:SHOT BECAUSE REJECTED\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nFourteen-Year-Old Girl the Victim\nOf a Jealous Lover\nDelia Green, a colored girl 14 years old[,] was shot last night about 12 o\u2019clock by Coony Houston and will probably die from the wound .\u202f.\u202f. And so Garst found her. And what a strange artifact the newspaper evidence turns out to be; forensic residue of the American mythos, it is a headline right out of Harry Smith\u2019s old, lethal America. The language is plain, perfunctory, flat and, in its own way, absolutely haunting, with a power derived not from syntax or insight but rather from the strange crossroads it has been fixed as, a kind of perpetual midnight. We can read it even now as though it is still happening. \u201cDelia .\u202f.\u202f. was shot last night about 12 o\u2019clock .\u202f.\u202f. and will probably die .\u202f.\u202f.\u201d Within the world of these sentences, Delia has just been shot but she is not yet gone. In the ordinary language of this newspaper passage, one accesses a middle space between Delia\u2019s complete anonymity prior to the shooting and her legendary afterlife following it. It\u2019s like visiting the spot that songs come from\n\n*\u2003*\u2003*\n\nBob Dylan put out a version of \u201cDelia\u201d a year -earlier than Cash did, on 1993\u2019s World Gone Wrong. His Delia is a purer remainder of the American folk tradition, funneled from the work of Blind Willie McTell and Reverend Gary Davis. Dylan didn\u2019t pick up the post-Bahamian strain but instead recovered the song\u2019s earlier, plainer enchantments, staying truer to the song\u2019s original context while also constricting its mythic afterlife. On World Gone Wrong, Delia\u2019s killer expects to pay a fine for the shooting and to end his obligations there. Instead, the killer ends up disappearing into prison after his sentencing; he spends his days in obscurity, sipping stale water from a tin cup, never to be heard from again\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d as Blind Willie McTell remarked to himself about the killer on his version of the song, the one that Dylan built his own around, \u201cthat\u2019s one more rounder gone.\u201d Strangely enough, McTell\u2019s phrase \u201cone more rounder gone\u201d itself came to be transformed, in an American-Bahamian game of Chinese whispers, into an aloof refrain: \u201cone more round, Delia\u2019s gone, one more round.\u201d The process of transformation has been lost to time; all we have left is this inexplicable keepsake. A portion of the mystery of \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d as we now know it, post-Cash, is the very peculiarity of that refrain. One more round of what? One more round of drinks. One more turn of fortune\u2019s wheel. One more spin through the song\u2019s morose particulars. Whenever one tries to crack open the refrain, it keeps revealing the same desolate theme: resignation, the very taste of fate. And when the song finishes, it seems we are left largely unsure as to what it is we are to be resigned. One more round of what, exactly? Don\u2019t worry, the song offers in unkind assurance, whatever it is, it\u2019ll be back again\nAccording to Teresa Goddu, it is nothing to be praised. For her, Cash\u2019s version of \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d slips easily into a damnable lineage of songs that \u201cparticipate in the ritual misogyny of gothic bluegrass without being held accountable for it.\u201d That is, by wrapping the killer\u2019s violence in a wink, Goddu argues, such songs get to enjoy a hatred of women without owning up to it. In analyzing the vicious posture of \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone,\u201d Goddu focuses in particular on the \u201cone more round\u201d refrain. \u201cWhile Delia\u2019s power is obvious from the many \u2018rounds\u2019 it takes to kill her,\u201d Goddu writes, \u201cthe song nevertheless celebrates the man\u2019s excessive violence (he kills her twice with a submachine gun).\u201d In a certain sense, Goddu is correct. On Cash\u2019s *American Recordings*, the brutality of Delia\u2019s murder is handled with an -adolescent wink. Listening to the song, imagining ourselves being driven to sing it, we are unsure whether we are meant to spasm with laughter or disgust. The song puts the dead back into deadpan and then slips off into the uneasy silence from which it had been delivered\n\n*\u2003*\u2003*\n\nCoony Houston, Delia\u2019s young murderer, considered his crime to be the product of adolescent rough-housing, an unfortunate consequence of puckish impertinence; like a jaywalker or careless driver\u2014like Dylan\u2019s pimp in primary colors\u2014he was willing to pay a fine. His lawyer\u2019s clemency petition on his behalf suggests that Houston was incapable of comprehending the enormity of his act:Petitioner further shows that he was just a mere child at the time when he got into bad company and so unfortunately committed the act that he now suffers for and that it was done by him not only accidentally, but when he was crazed by drink in boisterous company for the first time in his life and that the crowd he was with and in got him drunk .\u202f.\u202f. In his own view, Houston was merely a drunken, -boisterous child; he was the true victim of his crime\n\nAccording to the newspaper record, at the moment of Houston\u2019s conviction and sentencing, he was quite deaf to the incurability of Delia\u2019s silence. \u201cI exhort you to be a man,\u201d the judge remarked to Houston, \u201ceven in confinement, to repent of your past evil deeds and strive to earn the confidence and respect of those placed in authority over you.\u201d The historian Sean Wilentz, glossing on Garst\u2019s unpublished research, writes, \u201cCoony did not cooperate. Gaily, he thanked the judge and pranced out of the courtroom in a bailiff\u2019s custody, \u2018calm and as debonair .\u202f.\u202f. as if the experience through which he had just passed was a matter of every day occurrence and of no particular importance.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn his final recording of \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone,\u201d Cash corrected even as he carried forward Houston\u2019s childish impudence. In the world of American Recordings, Delia\u2019s killer is both unrepentant and nameless. More importantly, he is continually hounded by Delia\u2019s ghost. Supernatural reparations are at work, marking the song as the product of a mythic world, a world which is resolutely premodern\u2014prior to monetary compensation, prior to rationalized law\u2014in its bearing, if not its jurisdiction. The violence of Cash\u2019s final \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d is the violence of the sacred, governed by the offices of honor and retribution, not institutional sanction. From Cash\u2019s point of view, fate had long ago knitted Delia and her killer together as an emblem, singular and contorted. To such a state of affairs the killer has always been resigned: to Delia\u2019s low-down ways, to his inability to resist them, to the necessity of her murder, to the inevitable punishment his crime would call forth, to the long empty hallway of eternity they would together have to share. There is no sense that the killer or even Delia ever expected to live in any other kind of world. He kills Delia without ever expecting to get away with it. And even though he is jailed for the crime, we sense that he is beginning to understand that that is not nearly retribution enough, for even after his sentencing Delia still haunts his nights and his earthly bed\n\nPerhaps he is beginning to realize that the song itself is among his punishments, and that he will have to sing it forever (perhaps he will end up as a split rock ringing out her name). The listener might even start to hear Delia\u2019s footsteps as she patters around his cell and climbs onto his bed, kneeling upon his chest and cajoling him to sing her song again. \u201cJailer, oh jailer,\u201d the killer whispers to her, gently. \u201cJailer I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d As accepting of these twists of fate as her lover, Delia shows herself to be unmoved. Her nightly return to his cell is her renewal of their union (she never expected to live in any other kind of world). When she comes to him each night, what is the refrain of her final, recurring request? \u201c\u2018Delia\u2019s Gone,\u2019\u201d she demands. \u201cOne more round, \u2018Delia\u2019s Gone.\u2019\u201d\n\n*\u2003*\u2003*\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an old black tune,\u201d Cash explained. \u201cI just added Memphis, tying her in the chair, and the sub-machine gun.\u201d Back on his 1962 recording, when he first adapted \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d from its Bahamian afterlife in order to refashion it (again) as a ballad of Americana, Cash had inserted an awkward line about a brother in Memphis. For his resurrection of Delia on American Recordings, Cash remade Memphis as the central locale of the song\u2019s\u2014and the album\u2019s\u2014inner geography. In the Cash mythos, going up to Memphis is the same as returning inward, to one\u2019s unruly origins. Like Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, Cash had marked himself early as an outsider to the Nashville mainstream because of his roots in the miscegenational Memphis muck, and Cash (like his fellow million dollar cohorts) masterfully exploited this marking; it not only granted him the profile of a kind of wandering exile, a refugee from the dark end of the street, it also provided him with a point of origin he could continually return to, a spiritual birthplace that happened to coincide with a larger national fable\n\nIf Memphis truly does show up in more songs than any other city, clearly it is not because of its architectural or communal triumphs. The city stands for a sound; not only the echoing sound of Elvis\u2019 rockabilly yelp meeting Scottie Moore\u2019s electric strut and Bill Black\u2019s slapping bass, or of Jerry Lee Lewis\u2019 pumping piano and cruel magnificence, or of Al Green\u2019s Holy Ghost chasing falsetto, or of BB King\u2019s greasy digits wrenching out notes of blue and wonder from his Lucille, or of the famous boom-chika-boom of Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two but of the singular possibility that these sounds, in unison, offer: the potential for lonesome weirdos to step out of the shadows and into a kind of redemption. We might label this sound as being, in miniature, the American dream itself, or just a decent way to kill some time, or perhaps both\n\nThe sound belongs to Memphis, regardless. Cash\u2019s first Americana album, Ride This Train, released in 1960, not long after he left Memphis\u2019 Sun Records for Columbia, included the song \u201cGoing to Memphis,\u201d dressing Cash in familiar dressing. A member of a chain gang, all he wants to do is break loose and get himself lost in Memphis\u2019 \u201chonky tonk roll.\u201d Cash certainly jumped out as the bad seed he claimed to be in the song. \u201cMy brother was killed for a deed I did,\u201d he sang, anticipating the jailed brother in Memphis of his first Delia version two years later, \u201cbut I disremember what.\u201d As much as their unrepentant violence, it is the peculiar vocabulary choices of Cash\u2019s killers that jump out: I disremember? Humming somewhere behind his original \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone,\u201d Cash\u2019s even earlier \u201cI\u2019m Going to Memphis\u201d not only provides a key to Delia\u2019s eventual geographic locale, but also to Cash\u2019s peculiar notion of the murderous psyche, his tendency to link a giddily eccentric vocabulary\u2014from \u201cdisremember\u201d to \u201cdurn her mangy hide\u201d to \u201csub-mo-chine\u201d\u2014with a willingness to step outside the regulatory norms of good behavior. Even in confessing to their own atrocities, such Cashian killers refuse to consent to the boundaries of propriety; this refusal, like their words and deeds, mark the men as those who would prance around their own murder trial, who would regard the death of others with a haughty shrug. \u201cWell another boy is down, the shovel burned him out,\u201d Cash\u2019s Memphis-dreaming bad seed sings. \u201cLet me stand on his body to see what the shouting\u2019s about.\u201d\n\nCash\u2019s Memphis is American music\u2019s devilish Eden. Sin and redemption, transcendence and kitsch, God and Mammon: flipsides of the same record. It is everything Memphis dreams upon: bravado, swagger, danger, racial calamity and collusion, desperate pleas of faith. A place to be a criminal and to praise God both: this Memphis is a place that actually exists, but only in song, for maybe two or three minutes at a time. When Wyclef Jean covered \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d at a Johnny Cash tribute show in 1999, he covered the *American Recordings* version, outfitted in cowboy hat and boots, black jeans and black western shirt. In addition to bringing an island lilt back to the song, Jean also\u2014in Cash\u2019s fashion\u2014made one slightly colossal alteration to the story. \u201cI went up to *Brooklyn*,\u201d Jean sang, \u201cand I found Delia there.\u201d At that moment, when Brooklyn replaced Memphis, the live audience went a little nuts, recognizing Jean\u2019s revision as a small but significant victory. Memphis can be found anywhere, Jean announced; its redemptions and damnations lurk together in the shadows at the edge of any town, any self. It is the outline of a truer geography lurking within an immediate terrain\n\nIn his recent book *I Shot a Man in Reno*, Graeme Thomson points out that Cash\u2019s \u201cFolsom Prison Blues\u201d is in fact a cartographical blunder, putting a man in a California prison for a crime committed in Nevada, with a Texas-bound train inexplicably rolling by. Thomson\u2019s insight is very precisely beside the point. You could set these locations side by side, and add Memphis and New Orleans to the itinerary while you were at it, if you could only find the correct, mysterious train or lost highway or thrumming baritone that would link them all together. Cash\u2019s songs exist not in a political or scientific but a mythic landscape, even though that landscape\u2019s hills and gullies so often look like the real thing. If you want to find your angry muse, his songs tell us, you\u2019ll have to go up to your Memphis first. You\u2019ll have to cross a threshold. You can go by a fast train, the last train or by God\u2019s train; you can travel by a heavenly aeroplane or by a stolen car. By pick or by sword, by prick or by milk, whatever means of transport you choose: in order to undertake the journey, all veils of familiarity must be rent. If you want to find the eternal, look for it underground, on a hangman\u2019s scaffold or behind prison walls; it may even be waiting within your own parlor, ready to ambush. Looking back at his great *At Folsom Prison* toward the end of his life, Cash explained the process. \u201cWe are in the timeless now,\u201d he wrote, recollecting that first step onto the Folsom stage. \u201cThere is no calendar inside the cafeteria today.\u201d\n\n*\u2003*\u2003*\n\nAs it is in so many fables, when Death steps into \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d it is to take on the role of Ovid, metamorphic auteur: through her dying, Delia is transformed into every scrape of a branch, each cracking of the earth, all of the strange confetti of her killer\u2019s fears and dreams. The final drama of the song is that Delia cannot be restrained, not even through death. Delia\u2019s dying, her getting gone, only ends up tying her more permanently to her killer\n\nFor Cash himself, death was a mythic event, another metamorphosis: ain\u2019t no grave going to hold his body down. Its enormity was to be understood and embraced. To a modern consciousness, death is something unknown; taught to behave as though forever young, we regard our own death as either terrifying oblivion or an impossibility. The death of others is reduced even further; it is either simple information or a platform for mindless sentiment. Turning away from these barren arrangements, Cash and Delia have come to be reflections for one another: death is the role for which they both were born, both only fully assumed their dominion once they shrugged off their corporeal dressing and slipped into memory. Both were finally transformed completely into song\n\nIf Cash had truly wanted to tap into the emergent gangsta rap mythos of the early 1990s in order, as some commentators have claimed, to resurface his brand with a more marketable, gore-ridden shine, he would have dressed as a Stagger Lee and clothed himself in that ballad\u2019s particular dream of self-possession, where swagger and style are companion enough. He would have left Delia alone. But Cash\u2019s \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone\u201d is not a song of freedom but rather a lament, one that harrows intimacy, all its debts and wages. Back in Blind Willie McTell\u2019s version of \u201cDelia,\u201d her killer straight up asked the judge what the fuss was about, and his incomprehension, as much as his brutality, was the song\u2019s occasion. A slow learner, by the time of Cash\u2019s final version, the killer finally knows the fuss all too well. Despite Teresa Goddu\u2019s implications otherwise, Cash does not simply butcher Delia and then laugh at her in his final version of the song. Rather, he opens a window onto the world of Delia\u2019s butchering, where death is lightly regarded; he then opens a second window, onto a world where supernatural measures allow justice, finally, to be done\n\nThe invitation is to linger and ponder the stereoscopic view. Through \u201cDelia\u2019s Gone,\u201d both the power and the necessity of myth are made palpable: Delia\u2019s eternal return attests to the power of myth even as the horridly plain details of her actual death suggest the lack that calls forth a mythic imagination. Even in Teresa Goddu\u2019s critique of Cash\u2019s supposed misogyny, a supernatural sensibility slips into the writing, like a cat slipping through a half-closed door. \u201c[T]he song nevertheless celebrates the man\u2019s excessive violence,\u201d wrote Goddu, adding parenthetically, \u201che kills her twice with a submachine gun.\u201d Cash kills her twice. What ghoulish, gothic wonderment Goddu\u2019s phrase suggests. Delia is killed and then resurrected so she can be killed again. (Behold the rituals of love.)\n\nOne can rather easily dismiss Goddu\u2019s narrow, unhistorical reading of the \u201cone more round\u201d refrain\u2014as if the song\u2019s refrain floated solitarily within the boundaries of this one particular version of the Delia tale, untouched by its own genealogy\u2014but one cannot dismiss how Delia\u2019s otherworldly prowess seeps into Goddu\u2019s prose. He kills her twice. With a slip of the keyboard, Goddu provides the same uncanny testimony as Cash, illustrating just how it is one may channel forces more powerful, malignant and strange than one\u2019s intentions or philosophies may suspect\n\n*\u2003*\u2003*\n\nAccording to the court records discovered by John Garst, Moses \u201cCoony\u201d Houston shot Delia Green because he grew angry at her when she called him a son of a bitch. Shown unexpected clemency by the judge, Houston was paroled by the time he was twenty-six years of age. There is reason to believe he fled to New York City upon his release\n\nThrough the ballad registered in Delia\u2019s name, Cash lets us in on an open secret, one that he and Delia learned long, long ago: the world is not on our side. Acknowledging this, one is forced to turn elsewhere\u2014to fate or bad luck, to songs or to gods\u2014for justice. \u201cNot peace but a sword,\u201d wrote Norman O. Brown. \u201cPeace lies in finding the true war.\u201d One must not only hope that Moses Houston was confronted with Delia\u2019s song at every other city street corner, or that he grew to be haunted by her name, or that somewhere in the New York City darkness fate fit him to wear the other mask of violence, or that he felt at his own cruel expiration a familiar sensation of distant disregard. One must break into the world in which such justice can only be soYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1690163", "artist_names": "Perry Como", "full_title": "Make Someone Happy by\u00a0Perry\u00a0Como", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a72cc2711bdf5fc72462cdead8053585.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a72cc2711bdf5fc72462cdead8053585.770x770x1.jpg", "id": 1690163, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429904074, "path": "/Perry-como-make-someone-happy-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Perry-como-make-someone-happy-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a72cc2711bdf5fc72462cdead8053585.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a72cc2711bdf5fc72462cdead8053585.770x770x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Make Someone Happy", "title_with_featured": "Make Someone Happy", "updated_by_human_at": 1444771540, "url": "https://genius.com/Perry-como-make-someone-happy-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/60354", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/073a27b1d3dc10140a55c14cff5b458f.1000x313x1.jpg", "id": 60354, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a72cc2711bdf5fc72462cdead8053585.770x770x1.jpg", "index_character": "p", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Perry Como", "slug": "Perry-como", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Perry-como"}, "artist": "Perry Como", "lyrics": "Make Someone Happy LyricsDo, do do do do, do do!\nDo, do do do do, do do!\n\nMake, someone happy\nMake just one, someone happy\nMake just one heart the heart you sing to!\nOne smile that cheers you\nOne face that lights when it nears you\nOne girl you're everything to!\n\nFame, if you win it\nComes an' goes in a minute\nWhere's the 'real-stuff' in life to cling to?\nLove, is the answer\nSomeone to love, is the answer\nOnce you've found her\nBuild your world around her!\nMake, someone happy\nMake just one, someone happy\nAnd you will be happy too!\nFame, if you win it\nComes an' goes in a minute . . \n\nWhere's the 'real-stuff' in life to cling to?\nLove, is the answer\nSomeone to love, is the answer\nOnce you've found her\nBuild your world around her!\nMake, someone happy\nMake just one, someone happy\nAnd you will be happy too!\n\nYou'll be happy too . . \nYou'll be happy too . . \nHmmm . . \n\nDo, do do do do, do!\nDo, do do do do, do!\n\n~ from the Broadway production \"Do Re Mi\"You might also likeEmbed"}]
