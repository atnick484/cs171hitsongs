Bimmer (Let's go)\nThat girl know what she want, she make me take it off when she see me (Let's go)\nShe say I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV\nI had to say, \"No disrespect, gotta do it safe or you can keep it\"\nPop star, I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber\nShe know I'm a call away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her\nStand next to me, you gon' end up catchin' a fever (Yeah, yeah)\nI'm hot\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]\nI swear on my life that I've been a good girl (Good girl, good girl)\nTonight, I don't wanna be her\n\n[Chorus: Camila

coexist\nBut I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'\nIf I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit\nIt won't be for clout, it won't be for fame\nIt won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same\nIt won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers\nIt won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane\nEverything grows, it's destined to change\nI love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came\nI hope that you scrape every dollar you can\nI hope you know money won't erase the pain\nTo the OGs, I'm thankin' you now\nWas watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground\nI copied your cadence, I mirrored your style\nI studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now\nFuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice\nI ain't do no promo, still made all that noise\nThis year gon' be different, I set my intentions\nI promise to slap all that hate out your voice\nYou might also like[Refrain]\nNiggas been countin' me out\nI'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips\nI'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list\nI'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit\nThe real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit\nThe game is off balance, I'm back on my shit\nThe Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty\nBut that's how I like it, you all on my dick\n\n[Chorus]\nI just poured somethin' in my cup\nI've been wantin' somethin' I can feel\nPromise I am never lettin' up\nMoney in your palm don't make you real\nFoot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck\nI'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel\nIf it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck\nPistol in your hand don't make you real\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm dead in the middle of two generations\nI'm little bro and big bro all at once\nJust left the lab with young 21 Savage\nI'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch\nHad a long talk with the young nigga Kodak\nReminded me of young niggas from 'Ville\nStraight out the projects, no fakin', just honest\nI wish that he had more guidance, for real\nToo many niggas in cycle of jail\nSpending they birthdays inside of a cell\nWe coming from a long bloodline of trauma\nWe raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal\nWe hurting our sisters, the babies as well\nWe killing our brothers, they poisoned the well\nDistorted self-image, we set up to fail\nI'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga\n[Chorus]\nI just poured somethin' in my cup\nI've been wantin' somethin' I can feel\nPromise I am never lettin' up\nMoney in your palm don't make you real\nFoot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck\nI'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel\nIf it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck\nPistol in your hand don't make you

Lyrics[Chorus]\nFeels like we're on the edge right now\nI wish that I could say I'm proud\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nLet you down\nAll these voices in my head get loud\nI wish that I could shut them out\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nLe-le-let you down\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can\nI don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying\nI just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do\nWas never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you\nThought about everything you were never even wrong\nIn the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you\nWalking towards you with my head down\nLookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you\nParanoia, what did I do wrong this time?\nThat's parents for you\nVery loyal? Shoulda had my back\nBut you put a knife in it\u2014my hands are full\nWhat else should I carry for you?\nI cared for you, but\u2026\n[Chorus]\nFeels like we're on the edge right now\nI wish that I could say I'm proud\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nLe-le-let you down\nAll these voices in my head get loud\nI wish that I could shut them out\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nLe-le-let you down\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, you don't wanna make this work\nYou just wanna make this worse\nWant me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words\nYou don't wanna know my hurt, yeah\nLet me guess, you want an apology, probably\nHow can we keep going at a rate like this?\nWe can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave\nPlease, don't come after me\nI just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all\nGo ahead, just drink it off\nBoth know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong\nAin't that what you always do?\nI feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood\nWhat else can I offer you?\nThere's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nFeels like we're on the edge right now\nI wish that I could say I'm proud\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nLe-le-let you down\nAll these voices in my head get loud\nI wish that I could shut them out\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nLe-le-let you down\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, don't talk down to me\nThat's not gonna work now\nPacked all my clothes and I moved out\nI don't even wanna go to your house\nEvery time I sit on that couch\nI feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we\nCoulda made this work\nAnd prolly woulda figured things out\nBut I guess I'm a letdown\nBut it's cool, I checked out\nOh, you wanna be friends now?\nOkay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now\nSit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen\nI mean, why are you laughing?\nMust have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction\nNo, but at least you're happy\n[Chorus]\nFeels like we're on the edge right now\nI wish that I could say I'm proud\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nOh, I let you down\nAll these voices in my head get loud\nAnd I wish that I could shut them out\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nOh, let you down\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, I'm sorry\nI'm so sorry now\nYeah, I'm sorry that I let you down335Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count":

Drumma Boy]\n\nVerse 1:\nThey overdosing on my swag\nPut the whole god damn hood in rehab\nToo many rumples in my duffle\nCan't close this bag its so much cash\nI need 10 hands now to count my stash\nLL Cool Gucci Mane I'm back\nNever need a mask best check my stash\nYou must be hall-u-cin-a-tin\n1st day out girl ain't you glad?\n6 supermodels crashing at my pad\nI should be a model drinking outta gold bottles\nWith some tru religion jeans sagging off my ass\nPlease don't crash am I goin' to fast\nTouchdown anywhere I don't need no pass\nMight need some gum cause I'm finna talk trash\nCuz keep em on task like a kid at class\nHater can't hit what a hater can't see\nUntouchable these haters sure can't see me\nHe wouldn't know a hit if you hit him in the head\nWith a 4 by 4 standing 6 foot 3\nReady for a bitch, crocodile dun sheet\nNever met a girl I ain't fuck first week\nYou never seem a g throw a 10,000 white mink\nOn the floor live on B.E.T (Gucci)\n[Hook]\nI only got life I can live\nThere's only so much game I can give\nSo you could watch the show chillin' at your crib\nAnd weeks turn to months, and months turn to years\nBut I be smoking dro, Ima fuck some hoes\nIma ball today, wake up, then go ball some more\nCan't tell a grown man what to do with his\nIt's your prerogative Ima mind my biz\nBut Ima live the life, forever rocking ice\nThrowing money popping bottles cause that's just what I like\n(x2)\n\nVerse 2:\nScreaming I'mma be like the Black Eyed Peas\nI wanna be free and you wanna be me\nBest eased if you really want beef\nIma fight you by the trees looking like swiss cheese\nJust came home ain't thinking bout sleep\nBitch ya favorite rapper ain't slept in weeks\nThinkin' bout me like I'm down the street\nKnow it's over soon as my feet touch concrete\nPull up in South Beach blowing on trees\nWhipping down the street like I'm riding on D's\nA new ferrari flying down Peachtree\nGirl I might roll ya window down Gucci Mane please\nMake sure 2010 I'm free,fall off in the booth like 1017\nBefore I'm through fire jumping out the roof but we dont need water please bring more weed\nNiggas can't win now they wanna switch teams, can't entertain that by no means\nYou wanna get on nigga chase your dreams,stop chasing me down like a dope fiend\nStarting off my day with an M-16, shit ain't been the same since I turned 16\nMy whole life changed, now it's so icy\n1st album on the charts came out same week (Gucci)\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\nVerse 3:\nMy auntie had a stroke and she still can't speak, wrote me every week real talk thats deep\nEx-cell mate gotta 35 piece, won't be released till 2033\nIt's my son's birthday my boy turned 3, and looking at him is like looking at me\nCan't look back and watch the moves I make\nBut the moves that I made fuck around and move me\n\n[Hook]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 13, "api_path": "/songs/153998", "artist_names": "Lady Gaga", "full_title": "Paparazzi

mine\nAlways there when you call, always on time\nGave you my, baby\n\n[Chorus: Ashanti]\nBaby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time\nAnd I gave you my all, now baby, be mine\nI'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time\nAnd I gave you my all, now baby, be mine\n[Verse 1: Ja Rule]\nC'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover\nYou know, the one that swing dick like no other\nI know, I got a lot of things I need to explain\nBut, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain\nSo, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints\nOur sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint\n'Cause I can't wait no more\n'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me\nI got the Bentley valeted\nAnd I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades\nAnd I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades\nThrow down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids\nThug style, you never thought I'd make you smile\nWhile I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild\nBut we share something so rare, but who cares, you care\n\n[Chorus: Ashanti]\nBaby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time\nAnd I gave you my all, now baby, be mine\nI'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time\nAnd I gave you my all, now baby, be mine\n\n[Verse 2: Ja Rule]\nGirl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together\nIt's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather\nLike the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter\nAnd took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather\nBitch, you know better, we live M-O-B\nMoney over bitches, Murder, I-N-C\nI got two or three hoes for every V\nAnd I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy\nI'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee\nName a nigga in the league got more game than me\nI play hard, there's so many women I fathered\nMeet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered\nTruth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair\nAnd a love with no glare is a crystal stare\nBut we share something so rare, but who cares, you care\nSee Ja Rule LiveGet tickets as low as $65You might also like[Chorus: Ashanti]\nBaby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time\nAnd I gave you my all, now baby, be mine\nI'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time\nAnd I gave you my all, now baby, be mine\n\n[Verse 3: Ja Rule]\nOh, I'm feeling like you living a double life\nCause you don't be coming home sometimes\nBaby, but you're always on time, checking for one time\nYou and I got a special bond together\nWe go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather\nAnd when I play, you play the same way\nYou freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone\nBaby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy\nShe'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy\nRemind these bitches to mind they business\nBelieve me, this pimp game is very religious\nAnd I'm built like the Don Bishop\nGon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness\nThe life we share is a thug affair\nBut who cares, you care\n\n[Chorus: Ashanti]\nBaby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time\nAnd I gave you my all, now baby, be mine\nI'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time\nAnd I gave you my all, now baby, be mine\n[Outro: Ashanti]\nAlways there when you call, always on time\nGave you my, baby be mine\nAlways there when you call, always on

much for love\nIt was all a bunch of mush, that I just did not want\nPaid, was the issue of the day\nIf a girlfriend's got some game\nCouldn't be more fly, getting paid was everything\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I'm not every girl, and I don't need that world to validate me\n'Cause shorty got a job, shorty got a car\nShorty can pay her own rent\nDon't wanna dance if it's not in my heart\n[Chorus]\nMost girls want a man with the bling bling\nGot my own thing, got the ching ching\nI just want real love\nMost girls want a man with the mean green\nDon't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of\nA man that understands real love\n\n[Verse 2]\nI was a girl about the floss\nIt was all about the cost, how much he spent on me\nSeek, for a man who has got the means\nTo be giving you diamond rings\nIt's what every fly girl could want or even dream\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I'm not every girl, and I don't need no G to take care of me\n'Cause shorty got a job, shorty got a car\nShorty can pay her own rent\nDon't wanna dance if it's not in my heart, no, no\n\n[Chorus]\nMost girls want a man with the bling bling\nGot my own thing, got the ching ching\nI just want real love\nMost girls want a man with the mean green\nDon't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of\nA man that understands real love\nMost girls want a man with the bling bling (Most girls)\nGot my own thing, got the ching ching\nI just want real love (I just want real love)\nMost girls want a man with the mean green\nDon't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of\nA man that understands real love\nYou might also like[Interlude]\nBut I'm not every girl\nAnd I don't need no G to take care of me, no\n'Cause shorty got a job, shorty got a car\nShorty can pay her own rent\nDon't wanna dance if it's not in my heart\n(Oh, most girls)\n\n[Chorus]\nMost girls want a man with the bling bling\nGot my own thing, got the ching ching\nI just want real love (I just want real love)\n(Can you give me real love?)\nMost girls want a man with the mean green\nDon't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of\nA man that understands real love\nMost girls want a man with the bling bling\nGot my own thing, got the ching ching (Want my own)\nI just want real love (Real love)\nMost girls want a man with the mean green\nDon't wanna dance if he can't be

her promises never for real\nAs long as she stands there waiting\nWearing the holes in the soles of her shoes\nHow many days disappear?\nWhen you look in the mirror\nSo how do you choose?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYour clothes never wear as well the next day\nAnd your hair never falls in quite the same way\nYou never seem to run out of things to say\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is the story of a girl\nWho cried a river and drowned the whole world\nAnd while she looks so sad in photographs\nI absolutely love her\nWhen she smiles\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow how many lovers would stay\nJust to put up with this every day and all day?\nNow how did we wind up this way\nWatching our mouths for the words that we say?\nAs long as we stand here waiting\nWearing the clothes or the soles that we choose\nHow do we get there today\nWhen we're walking too far for the price of our shoes?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYour clothes never wear as well the next day\nAnd your hair never falls in quite the same way\nBut you never

it apart (blowin' it apart)\nAs you're spinnin' like a merry-go-round\nIndications of a storm touchin' down\nI wish that I could weather any storm\nBut I guess it was a heartbreak from the norm\nWas a day I will always remember\nThe saddest day in sweet November\n[Chorus]\nLately (I've been watchin' you)\nBeen thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)\nJust sittin' away watchin' the days go

knees\nPrayin', \"God help me, please\nBring my baby back\nRight back to me\" (Mmm)\nIf lovin' you is right\nThen I don't wanna go wrong\nSo I drown myself with tears\nSitting here, singin' another sad love song\n\n[Chorus]\nLately (I've been watchin' you)\nBeen thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)\nJust sittin' away watchin' the days go by\nLately (I've been watchin' you)\nBeen

looked good, I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a six-four Impala\n[Verse 1]\nI wish I was like six-foot-nine so I can get with Leoshi\n'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine\nYou know I see her all the time, everywhere I go\nAnd even in my dreams, I can scheme of ways to make her mine\n'Cause I know she's livin' phat\nHer boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that?\n'Cause when it comes to playing basketball\nI'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all\nSo I just lean up on the wall\nOr sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball\nDag, y'all! I never understood, black\nWhy the jocks get the fly girls, and me, I get the hood rats\nI tell 'em, \"Scat, skittle, sca-bobble\"\nGot hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess\nI confess it's a shame\nWhen you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name\nGlad I came, to my senses\nLike quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach\nOvercometh by thoughts of me and her together, right?\nSo when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller\nI wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a six-four Impala\nI wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller\nI wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a six-four Impala\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nI wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback\nAnd everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at\nAnd when I'm in my car I'm laid back\nI got an 8-track, and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat\nAnd do you really wanna know what's really wack?\nSee, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?\nI heard that prom night is a bomb night\nWith a hood rat you can hold tight\nBut really though, I'm Figaro\nWhen in my car, I can't even get a hello\nWell, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday\nOne day I'mma have to get in my car and go\nYou know I take the 110 until the 105\nGet off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, \"Look alive!\"\n'Cause it's hard to survive\nWhen you're living in a concrete jungle\nAnd these girls keep Passin' Me By\nShe looks fly, she looks fly\nMake me say, \"my, my, my\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller\nI wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a six-four Impala\nI wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller\nI wish I had a girl who looked good, I

Friday, and you could even speed on the highway\nI would play ghetto games\nName my kids ghetto names: Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine\nYo, you know that's on the real\nSo if you're down on your luck then you should know just how I feel\n'Cause if you don't want me around\nSee, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound\nHey, you, what's that sound?\nEverybody look what's going down\nAh, yes, ain't that fresh?\nEverybody wants to get down like that\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller\nI wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in

baby\nBefore I let you go, before I let you go\nCan I get a kiss, goodnight, baby\nBefore I let you go, before I let you go\nCan I get a kiss, goodnight, baby\nBefore I let you go, before I let you go\nCan I get a kiss, goodnight, baby\n\n[Verse 1]\nLately, I've been thinking something's going wrong\nCause you got an attitude\nAnd you're not in the mood, like you used to\nGirl I can feel it when I hold you in my arms\nThe feeling is not the same\nCan I be the one to blame?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't wanna lose your love\nI don't wanna say bye-bye\nTrue love is so hard to find\nAnd it's right between your lips and mine\nAnd mine (Before I let go)\n\n[Chorus]\nBefore I let you go away\nCan I get a kiss goodnight?\nBefore I let you go away\nCan I get a kiss goodnight?\n\n[Verse 2]\nListen baby, turn the lights down low, let's take it nice and slow\nMy mission is to keep you mine\nDon't want this to be the last time\nWe make sweet love baby; I know you feel it, too\nIt's bigger than the both of us\nThere's one thing I'm so certain of\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't wanna lose your love (Don't wanna lose ya)\nI don't wanna say bye bye (Don't wanna lose ya)\nIt's always the little things\nI remember and I can't just let it slip away\nSlip away (before)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBefore I let you go away\nCan I get a kiss goodnight?\nBefore I let you go away\nCan I get a kiss goodnight?\n\n[Interlude]\nTeddy, won't you play the music for me\nTeddy, won't you play\nBlackstreet say\n\n[Bridge 1]\n(Don't wanna lose ya)\nBaby I get so lonely sometimes, I\n(Don't wanna lose ya)\nBaby my heart is broken sometimes\nI need you right now, I don't\nDon't wanna loose ya\nI can't let you slip away, slip away\nBefore I let go\n\n[Chorus]\nBefore I let you go away\nCan I get a kiss goodnight?\nBefore I let you go away\nCan I get a kiss goodnight?\n[Bridge 2]\nBefore I let you go, before I let you go\nCan I get a kiss goodnight, baby?\nBefore I let you go, before I let you go\nCan I get a kiss goodnight, baby?\nBefore I let you go, before I let you go\nCan I get a kiss goodnight, baby?\nBefore I let you go, before I let you go\nCan I get a kiss goodnight, baby?\n\n[Outro]\nI don't want lose your sweet love\nSo don't say goodbye, say goodnight1Embed"}]
