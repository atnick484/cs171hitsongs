Braddock to become the heavy-weight champion of the world. And all the Negroes in Lansing, like Negroes everywhere, went wildly happy with the greatest celebration of race pride our generation had ever known. Every Negro boy old enough to walk wanted to be the next Brown Bomber. My brother Philbert, who had already become a pretty good boxer in school, was no exception. (I was trying to play basketball. I was gangling and tall, but I wasn't very good at it -- too awkward.) In the fall of that year, Philbert entered the amateur bouts that were held in Lansing's Prudden Auditorium.\n\nHe did well, surviving the increasingly tough eliminations. I would go down to the gym and watch him train. It was very exciting. Perhaps without realizing it I became secretly envious; for one thing, I know I could not help seeing some of my younger brother Reginald's lifelong admiration for me getting siphoned off to Philbert.\nPeople praised Philbert as a natural boxer. I figured that since we belonged to the same family, maybe I would become one, too. So I put myself in the ring. I think I was thirteen when I signed up for my first bout, but my height and rawboned frame let me get away with claiming that I was sixteen, the minimum age -- and my weight of about 128 pounds got me classified as a bantamweight.\n\nThey matched me with a white boy, a novice like myself, named Bill Peterson. I'll never forget him. When our turn in the next amateur bouts came up, all of my brothers and sisters were there watching, along with just about everyone else I knew in town. They were there not so much because of me but because of Philbert, who had begun to build up a pretty good following, and they wanted to see how his brother would do.\n\nI walked down the aisle between the people thronging the rows of seats, and climbed in the ring. Bill Peterson and I were introduced, and then the referee called us together and mumbled all of that stuff about fighting fair and breaking clean. Then the bell rang and we came out of our corners. I knew I was scared, but I didn't know, as Bill Peterson told me later on, that he was scared of me, too. He was so scared I was going to hurt him that he knocked me down fifty times if he did once.\n\nHe did such a job on my reputation in the Negro neighborhood that I practically went into hiding. A Negro just can't be whipped by somebody white and return with his head up to the neighborhood, especially in those days, when sports and, to a lesser extent show business, were the only fields open to Negroes, and when the ring was the only place a Negro could whip a white man and not be lynched. When I did show my face again, the Negroes I knew rode me so badly I knew I had to do something.\nBut the worst of my humiliations was my younger brother Reginald's attitude: he simply never mentioned the fight. It was the way he looked at me -- and avoided looking at me. So I went back to the gym, and I trained -- hard. I beat bags and skipped rope and grunted and sweated all over the place. And finally I signed up to fight Bill Peterson again. This time, the bouts were held in his hometown of Alma, Michigan.\n\nThe only thing better about the rematch was that hardly anyone I knew was there to see it; I was particularly grateful for Reginald's absence. The moment the bell rang, I saw a fist, then the canvas coming up, and ten seconds later the referee was saying \"Ten!\" over me. It was probably the shortest \"fight\" in history. I lay there listening to the full count, but I couldn't move. To tell the truth, I'm not sure I wanted to move.\n\nThat white boy was the beginning and the end of my fight career. A lot of times in these later years since I became a Muslim, I've thought back to that fight and reflected that it was Allah's work to stop me: I might have wound up punchy.\n\nNot long after this, I came into a classroom with my hat on. I did it deliberately. The teacher, who was white, ordered me to keep the hat on, and to walk around and around the room until he told me to stop. \"That way,\" he said, \"everyone can see you. Meanwhile, we'll go on with class for those who are here to learn something.\"\n\nI was still walking around when he got up from his desk and turned to the blackboard to write something on it. Everyone in the classroom was looking when, at this moment, I passed behind his desk, snatched up a thumbtack and deposited it in his chair. When he turned to sit back down, I was far from the scene of the crime, circling around the rear of the room. Then he hit the tack, and I heard him holler and caught a glimpse of him spraddling up as I disappeared through the door.\n\nWith my deportment record, I wasn't really shocked when the decision came that I had been expelled.\n\nI guess I must have had some vague idea that if I didn't have to go to school, I'd be allowed to stay on with the Gohannases and wander around town, or maybe get a job if I wanted one for pocket money. But I got rocked on my heels when a state man whom I hadn't seen before came and got me at the Gohannases' and took me down to court.\n\nThey told me I was going to go to a reform school. I was still thirteen years old.\n\nBut first I was going to the detention home. It was in Mason, Michigan, about twelve miles from Lansing. The detention home was where all the \"bad\" boys and girls from Ingham County were held, on their way to reform school -- waiting for their hearings.\n\nThe white state man was a Mr. Maynard Allen. He was nicer to me than most of the state Welfare people had been. He even had consoling words for the Gohannases and Mrs. Adcock and Big Boy; all of them were crying. But I wasn't. With the few clothes I owned stuffed into a box, we rode in his car to Mason. He talked as he drove along, saying that my school marks showed that if I would just straighten up, I could make something of myself. He said that reform school had the wrong reputation; he talked about what the word \"reform\" meant -- to change and become better. He said the school was really a place where boys like me could have time to see their mistakes and start a new life and become somebody everyone would be proud of. And he told me that the lady in charge of the detention home, a Mrs. Swerlin, and her husband were very good people.\n\nThey were good people. Mrs. Swerlin was bigger than her husband, I remember, a big, buxom, robust, laughing woman, and Mr. Swerlin was thin, with black hair, and a black mustache and a red face, quiet and polite, even to me.\n\nThey liked me right away, too. Mrs. Swerlin showed me to my room, my own room -- the first in my life. It was in one of those huge dormitory-like buildings where kids in detention were kept in those days -- and still are in most places. I discovered next, with surprise, that I was allowed to eat with the Swerlins. It was the first time I'd eaten with white people -- at least with grown white people -- since the Seventh Day Adventist country meetings. It wasn't my own exclusive privilege, of course. Except for the very troublesome boys and girls at the detention home, who were kept locked up -- those who had run away and been caught and brought back, or something like that -- all of us ate with the Swerlins sitting at the head of the long tables.\n\nThey had a white cook-helper, I recall -- Lucille Lathrop. (It amazes me how these names come back, from a time I haven't thought about for more than twenty years.) Lucille treated me well, too. Her husband's name was Duane Lathrop. He worked somewhere else, but he stayed there at the detention home on the weekends with Lucille.\nI noticed again how white people smelled different from us, and how their food tasted different, not seasoned like Negro cooking. I began to sweep and mop and dust around in the Swerlins' house, as I had done with Big Boy at the Gohannases'.\n\nThey all liked my attitude, and it was out of their liking for me that I soon became accepted by them -- as a mascot, I know now. They would talk about anything and everything with me standing right there hearing them, the same way people would talk freely in front of a pet canary. They would even talk about me, or about \"niggers,\" as though I wasn't there, as if I wouldn't understand what the word meant. A hundred times a day, they used the word \"nigger.\" I suppose that in their own minds, they meant no harm; in fact they probably meant well. It was the same with the cook, Lucille, and her husband, Duane. I remember one day when Mr. Swerlin, as nice as he was, came in from Lansing, where he had been through the Negro section, and said to Mrs. Swerlin right in front of me, \"I just can't see how those niggers can be so happy and be so poor.\" He talked about how they lived in shacks, but had those big, shining cars out front.\nAnd Mrs. Swerlin said, me standing right there, \"Niggers are just that way. . . .\" That scene always stayed with me.\n\nIt was the same with the other white people, most of them local politicians, when they would come visiting the Swerlins. One of their favorite parlor topics was \"niggers.\" One of them was the judge who was in charge of me in Lansing. He was a close friend of the Swerlins. He would ask about me when he came, and they would call me in, and he would look me up and down, his expression approving, like he was examining a fine colt, or a pedigreed pup. I knew they must have told him how I acted and how I worked.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that it just never dawned upon them that I could understand, that I wasn't a pet, but a human being. They didn't give me credit for having the same sensitivity, intellect, and understanding that they would have been ready and willing to recognize in a white boy in my position. But it has historically been the case with white people, in their regard for black people, that even though we might be with them, we weren't considered of them. Even though they appeared to have opened the door, it was still closed. Thus they never did really see me.\n\nThis is the sort of kindly condescension which I try to clarify today, to these integration-hungry Negroes, about their \"liberal\" white friends, these so-called \"good white people\" -- most of them anyway. I don't care how nice one is to you; the thing you must always remember is that almost never does he really see you as he sees himself, as he sees his own kind. He may stand with you through thin, but not thick; when the chips are down, you'll find that as fixed in him as his bone structure is his sometimes subconscious conviction that he's better than anybody black.\n\nBut I was no more than vaguely aware of anything like that in my detention-home years. I did my little chores around the house, and everything was fine. And each weekend, they didn't mind my catching a ride over to Lansing for the afternoon or evening. If I wasn't old enough, I sure was big enough by then, and nobody ever questioned my hanging out, even at night, in the streets of the Negro section.\n\nI was growing up to be even bigger than Wilfred and Philbert, who had begun to meet girls at the school dances, and other places, and introduced me to a few. But the ones who seemed to like me, I didn't go for -- and vice versa. I couldn't dance a lick, anyway, and I couldn't see squandering my few dimes on girls. So mostly I pleasured myself these Saturday nights by gawking around the Negro bars and restaurants. The jukeboxes were wailing Erskine Hawkins' \"Tuxedo Junction,\" Slim and Slam's \"Flatfoot Floogie,\" things like that. Sometimes, big bands from New York, out touring the one-night stands in the sticks, would play for big dances in Lansing. Everybody with legs would come out to see any performer who bore the magic name \"New York.\" Which is how I first heard Lucky Thompson and Milt Jackson, both of whom I later got to know well in Harlem.\n\nMany youngsters from the detention home, when their dates came up, went off to the reform school. But when mine came up -- two or three times -- it was always ignored. I saw new youngsters arrive and leave. I was glad and grateful. I knew it was Mrs. Swerlin's doing. I didn't want to leave.\n\nShe finally told me one day that I was going to be entered in Mason Junior High School. It was the only school in town. No ward of the detention home had ever gone to school there, at least while still a ward. So I entered their seventh grade. The only other Negroes there were some of the Lyons children, younger than I was, in the lower grades. The Lyonses and I, as it happened, were the town's only Negroes. They were, as Negroes, very much respected. Mr. Lyons was a smart, hardworking man, and Mrs. Lyons was a very good woman. She and my mother, I had heard my mother say, were two of the four West Indians in that whole section of Michigan.\n\nSome of the white kids at school, I found, were even friendlier than some of those in Lansing had been. Though some, including the teachers, called me \"nigger,\" it was easy to see that they didn't mean any more harm by it than the Swerlins. As the \"nigger\" of my class, I was in fact extremely popular -- I suppose partly because I was kind of a novelty. I was in demand, I had top priority. But I also benefited from the special prestige of having the seal of approval from that Very Important Woman about the town of Mason, Mrs. Swerlin. Nobody in Mason would have dreamed of getting on the wrong side of her. It became hard for me to get through a school day without someone after me to join this or head up that -- the debating society, the Junior High basketball team, or some other extracurricular activity. I never turned them down.\n\nAnd I hadn't been in the school long when Mrs. Swerlin, knowing I could use spending money of my own, got me a job after school washing the dishes in a local restaurant. My boss there was the father of a white classmate whom I spent a lot of time with. His family lived over the restaurant. It was fine working there. Every Friday night when I got paid, I'd feel at least ten feet tall. I forget how much I made, but it seemed like a lot. It was the first time I'd ever had any money to speak of, all my own, in my whole life. As soon as I could afford it, I bought a green suit and some shoes, and at school I'd buy treats for the others in my class -- at least as much as any of them did for me.\n\nEnglish and history were the subjects I liked most. My English teacher, I recall -- a Mr. Ostrowski -- was always giving advice about how to become something in life. The one thing I didn't like about history class was that the teacher, Mr. Williams, was a great one for \"nigger\" jokes. One day during my first week at school, I walked into the room and he started singing to the class, as a joke, \"'Way down yonder in the cotton field, some folks say that a nigger won't steal.\" Very funny. I liked history, but I never thereafter had much liking for Mr. Williams. Later, I remember, we came to the textbook section on Negro history. It was exactly one paragraph long. Mr. Williams laughed through it practically in a single breath, reading aloud how the Negroes had been slaves and then were freed, and how they were usually lazy and dumb and shiftless. He added, I remember, an anthropological footnote on his own, telling us between laughs how Negroes' feet were \"so big that when they walk, they don't leave tracks, they leave a hole in the ground.\"\n\nI'm sorry to say that the subject I most disliked was mathematics. I have thought about it. I think the reason was that mathematics leaves no room for argument. If you made a mistake, that was all there was to it.\nBasketball was a big thing in my life, though. I was on the team; we traveled to neighboring towns such as Howell and Charlotte, and wherever I showed my face, the audiences in the gymnasiums \"niggered\" and \"cooned\" me to death. Or called me \"Rastus.\" It didn't bother my teammates or my coach at all, and to tell the truth, it bothered me only vaguely. Mine was the same psychology that makes Negroes even today, though it bothers them down inside, keep letting the white man tell them how much \"progress\" they are making. They've heard it so much they've almost gotten brainwashed into believing it -- or at least accepting it.\n\nAfter the basketball games, there would usually be a school dance. Whenever our team walked into another school's gym for the dance, with me among them, I could feel the freeze. It would start to ease as they saw that I didn't try to mix, but stuck close to someone on our team, or kept to myself. I think I developed ways to do it without making it obvious. Even at our own school, I could sense it almost as a physical barrier, that despite all the beaming and smiling, the mascot wasn't supposed to dance with any of the white girls.\n\nIt was some kind of psychic message -- not just from them, but also from within myself. I am proud to be able to say that much for myself, at least. I would just stand around and smile and talk and drink punch and eat sandwiches, and then I would make some excuse and get away early.\n\nThey were typical small-town school dances. Sometimes a little white band from Lansing would be brought in to play. But most often, the music was a phonograph set up on a table, with the volume turned up high, and the records scratchy, blaring things like Glenn Miller's \"Moonlight Serenade\" -- his band was riding high then -- or the Ink Spots, who were also very popular, singing \"If I Didn't Care.\"\n\nI used to spend a lot of time thinking about a peculiar thing. Many of these Mason white boys, like the ones at the Lansing school -- especially if they knew me well, and if we hung out a lot together -- would get me off in a corner somewhere and push me to proposition certain white girls, sometimes their own sisters. They would tell me that they'd already had the girls themselves -- including their sisters -- or that they were trying to and couldn't. Later on, I came to understand what was going on: If they could get the girls into the position of having broken the terrible taboo by slipping off with me somewhere, they would have that hammer over the girls' heads, to make them give in to them.\n\nIt seemed that the white boys felt that I, being a Negro, just naturally knew more about \"romance,\" or sex, than they did -- that I instinctively knew more about what to do and say with their own girls. I never did tell anybody that I really went for some of the white girls, and some of them went for me, too. They let me know in many ways. But anytime we found ourselves in any close conversations or potentially intimate situations, always there would come up between us some kind of a wall. The girls I really wanted to have were a couple of Negro girls whom Wilfred or Philbert had introduced me to in Lansing. But with these girls, somehow, I lacked the nerve.\n\nFrom what I heard and saw on the Saturday nights I spent hanging around in the Negro district I knew that race-mixing went on in Lansing. But strangely enough, this didn't have any kind of effect on me. Every Negro in Lansing, I guess, knew how white men would drive along certain streets in the black neighborhoods and pick up Negro streetwalkers who patrolled the area. And, on the other hand, there was a bridge that separated the Negro and Polish neighborhoods, where white women would drive or walk across and pick up Negro men, who would hang around in certain places close to the bridge, waiting for them. Lansing's white women, even in those days, were famous for chasing Negro men. I didn't yet appreciate how most whites accord to the Negro this reputation for prodigious sexual prowess. There in Lansing, I never heard of any trouble about this mixing, from either side. I imagine that everyone simply took it for granted, as I did.\n\nAnyway, from my experience as a little boy at the Lansing school, I had become fairly adept at avoiding the white-girl issue -- at least for a couple of years yet.\nThen, in the second semester of the seventh grade, I was elected class president. It surprised me even more than other people. But I can see now why the class might have done it. My grades were among the highest in the school. I was unique in my class, like a pink poodle. And I was proud; I'm not going to say I wasn't. In fact, by then, I didn't really have much feeling about being a Negro, because I was trying so hard, in every way I could, to be white. Which is why I am spending much of my life today telling the American black man that he's wasting his time straining to \"integrate.\" I know from personal experience. I tried hard enough.\n\n\"Malcolm, we're just so proud of you!\" Mrs. Swerlin exclaimed when she heard about my election. It was all over the restaurant where I worked. Even the state man, Maynard Allen, who still dropped by to see me once in a while, had a word of praise. He said he never saw anybody prove better exactly what \"reform\" meant. I really liked him -- except for one thing: he now and then would drop something that hinted my mother had let us down somehow.\n\nFairly often, I would go and visit the Lyonses, and they acted as happy as though I was one of their children. And it was the same warm feeling when I went into Lansing to visit my brothers and sisters, and the Gohannases.\n\nI remember one thing that marred this time for me: the movie \"Gone with the Wind.\" When it played in Mason, I was the only Negro in the theater, and when Butterfly McQueen went into her act, I felt like crawling under the rug.\n\nEvery Saturday, just about, I would go into Lansing. I was going on fourteen, now. Wilfred and Hilda still lived out by themselves at the old family home. Hilda kept the house very clean. It was easier than my mother's plight, with eight of us always underfoot or running around. Wilfred worked wherever he could, and he still read every book he could get his hands on. Philbert was getting a reputation as one of the better amateur fighters in this part of the state; everyone really expected that he was going to become a professional.\n\nReginald and I, after my fighting fiasco, had finally gotten back on good terms. It made me feel great to visit him and Wesley over at Mrs. Williams'. I'd offhandedly give them each a couple of dollars to just stick in their pockets, to have something to spend. And little Yvonne and Robert were doing okay, too, over at the home of the West Indian lady, Mrs. McGuire. I'd give them about a quarter apiece; it made me feel good to see how they were coming along.\n\nNone of us talked much about our mother. And we never mentioned our father. I guess none of us knew what to say. We didn't want anybody else to mention our mother either, I think. From time to time, though, we would all go over to Kalamazoo to visit her. Most often we older ones went singly, for it was something you didn't want to have to experience with anyone else present, even your brother or sister.\n\nDuring this period, the visit to my mother that I most remember was toward the end of that seventh-grade year, when our father's grown daughter by his first marriage, Ella, came from Boston to visit us. Wilfred and Hilda had exchanged some letters with Ella, and I, at Hilda's suggestion, had written to her from the Swerlins'. We were all excited and happy when her letter told us that she was coming to Lansing.\n\nI think the major impact of Ella's arrival, at least upon me, was that she was the first really proud black woman I had ever seen in my life. She was plainly proud of her very dark skin. This was unheard of among Negroes in those days, especially in Lansing.\n\nI hadn't been sure just what day she would come. And then one afternoon I got home from school and there she was. She hugged me, stood me away, looked me up and down. A commanding woman, maybe even bigger than Mrs. Swerlin. Ella wasn't just black, but like our father, she was jet black. The way she sat, moved, talked, did everything, bespoke somebody who did and got exactly what she wanted. This was the woman my father had boasted of so often for having brought so many of their family out of Georgia to Boston. She owned some property, he would say, and she was \"in society.\" She had come North with nothing, and she had worked and saved and had invested in property that she built up in value, and then she started sending money to Georgia for another sister, brother, cousin, niece or nephew to come north to Boston. All that I had heard was reflected in Ella's appearance and bearing. I had never been so impressed with anybody. She was in her second marriage; her first husband had been a doctor.\n\nElla asked all kinds of questions about how I was doing; she had already heard from Wilfred and Hilda about my election as class president. She asked especially about my grades, and I ran and got my report cards. I was then one of the three highest in the class. Ella praised me. I asked her about her brother, Earl, and her sister, Mary. She had the exciting news that Earl was a singer with a band in Boston. He was singing under the name of Jimmy Carleton. Mary was also doing well.\n\nElla told me about other relatives from that branch of the family. A number of them I'd never heard of; she had helped them up from Georgia. They, in their turn, had helped up others. \"We Littles have to stick together,\" Ella said. It thrilled me to hear her say that, and even more, the way she said it. I had become a mascot; our branch of the family was split to pieces; I had just about forgotten about being a Little in any family sense. She said that different members of the family were working in good jobs, and some even had small businesses going. Most of them were homeowners.\n\nWhen Ella suggested that all of us Littles in Lansing accompany her on a visit to our mother, we all were grateful. We all felt that if anyone could do anything that could help our mother, that might help her get well and come back, it would be Ella. Anyway, all of us, for the first time together, went with Ella to Kalamazoo.\n\nOur mother was smiling when they brought her out. She was extremely surprised when she saw Ella. They made a striking contrast, the thin near-white woman and the big black one hugging each other. I don't remember much about the rest of the visit, except that there was a lot of talking, and Ella had everything in hand, and we left with all of us feeling better than we ever had about the circumstances. I know that for the first time, I felt as though I had visited with someone who had some kind of physical illness that had just lingered on.\n\nA few days later, after visiting the homes where each of us were staying, Ella left Lansing and returned to Boston. But before leaving, she told me to write to her regularly. And she had suggested that I might like to spend my summer holiday visiting her in Boston. I jumped at that chance.\n2.\n\nThat summer of 1940, in Lansing, I caught the Greyhound bus for Boston with my cardboard suitcase, and wearing my green suit. If someone had hung a sign, \"HICK,\" around my neck, I couldn't have looked much more obvious. They didn't have the turnpikes then; the bus stopped at what seemed every corner and cowpatch. From my seat in -- you guessed it -- the back of the bus, I gawked out of the window at white man's America rolling past for what seemed a month, but must have been only a day and a half.\n\nWhen we finally arrived, Ella met me at the terminal and took me home. The house was on Waumbeck Street in the Sugar Hill section of Roxbury, the Harlem of Boston. I met Ella's second husband, Frank, who was now a soldier; and her brother Earl, the singer who called himself Jimmy Carleton; and Mary, who was very different from her older sister. It's funny how I seemed to think of Mary as Ella's sister, instead of her being, just as Ella is, my own half-sister. It's probably because Ella and I always were much closer as basic types; we're dominant people, and Mary has always been mild and quiet, almost shy.\n\nElla was busily involved in dozens of things. She belonged to I don't know how many different clubs; she was a leading light of local so-called \"black society.\" I saw and met a hundred black people there whose big-city talk and ways left my mouth hanging open.\n\nI couldn't have feigned indifference if I had tried to. People talked casually about Chicago, Detroit, New York. I didn't know the world contained as many Negroes as I saw thronging downtown Roxbury at night, especially on Saturdays. Neon lights, nightclubs, poolhalls, bars, the cars they drove! Restaurants made the streets smell -- rich, greasy, down-home black cooking! Jukeboxes blared Erskine Hawkins, Duke Ellington, Cootie Williams, dozens of others. If somebody had told me then that some day I'd know them all personally, I'd have found it hard to believe. The biggest bands, like these, played at the Roseland State Ballroom, on Boston's Massachusetts Avenue -- one night for Negroes, the next night for whites.\n\nI saw for the first time occasional black-white couples strolling around arm in arm. And on Sundays, when Ella, Mary, or somebody took me to church, I saw churches for black people such as I had never seen. They were many times finer than the white church I had attended back in Mason, Michigan. There, the white people just sat and worshiped with words; but the Boston Negroes, like all other Negroes I had ever seen at church, threw their souls and bodies wholly into worship.\n\nTwo or three times, I wrote letters to Wilfred intended for everybody back in Lansing. I said I'd try to describe it when I got back.\n\nBut I found I couldn't.\n\nMy restlessness with Mason -- and for the first time in my life a restlessness with being around white people -- began as soon as I got back home and entered eighth grade.\n\nI continued to think constantly about all that I had seen in Boston, and about the way I had felt there. I know now that it was the sense of being a real part of a mass of my own kind, for the first time.\n\nThe white people -- classmates, the Swerlins, the people at the restaurant where I worked -- noticed the change. They said, \"You're acting so strange. You don't seem like yourself, Malcolm. What's the matter?\"\n\nI kept close to the top of the class, though. The topmost scholastic standing, I remember, kept shifting between me, a girl named Audrey Slaugh, and a boy named Jimmy Cotton.\n\nIt went on that way, as I became increasingly restless and disturbed through the first semester. And then one day, just about when those of us who had passed were\nabout to move up to 8-A, from which we would enter high school the next year, something happened which was to become the first major turning point of my life.\n\nSomehow, I happened to be alone in the classroom with Mr. Ostrowski, my English teacher. He was a tall, rather reddish white man and he had a thick mustache. I had gotten some of my best marks under him, and he had always made me feel that he liked me. He was, as I have mentioned, a natural-born \"advisor,\" about what you ought to read, to do, or think -- about any and everything. We used to make unkind jokes about him: why was he teaching in Mason instead of somewhere else, getting\nfor himself some of the \"success in life\" that he kept telling us how to get?\n\nI know that he probably meant well in what he happened to advise me that day. I doubt that he meant any harm. It was just in his nature as an American white man. I was one of his top students, one of the school's top students -- but all he could see for me was the kind of future \"in your place\" that almost all white people see for black people.\n\nHe told me, \"Malcolm, you ought to be thinking about a career. Have you been giving it thought?\"\n\nThe truth is, I hadn't. I never have figured out why I told him, \"Well, yes, sir, I've been thinking I'd like to be a lawyer.\" Lansing certainly had no Negro lawyers -- or doctors either -- in those days, to hold up an image I might have aspired to. All I really knew for certain was that a lawyer didn't wash dishes, as I was doing.\n\nMr. Ostrowski looked surprised, I remember, and leaned back in his chair and clasped his hands behind his head. He kind of half-smiled and said, \"Malcolm, one of life's first needs is for us to be realistic. Don't misunderstand me, now. We all here like you, you know that. But you've got to be realistic about being a nigger. A lawyer -- that's no realistic goal for a nigger. You need to think about something you can be. You're good with your hands -- making things. Everybody admires your carpentry shop work. Why don't you plan on carpentry? People like you as a person -- you'd get all kinds of work.\"\n\nThe more I thought afterwards about what he said, the more uneasy it made me. It just kept treading around in my mind.\n\nWhat made it really begin to disturb me was Mr. Ostrowski's advice to others in my class -- all of them white. Most of them had told him they were planning to become farmers. But those who wanted to strike out on their own, to try something new, he had encouraged. Some, mostly girls, wanted to be teachers. A few wanted other professions, such as one boy who wanted to become a county agent; another, a veterinarian; and one girl wanted to be a nurse. They all reported that Mr. Ostrowski had encouraged what they had wanted. Yet nearly none of them had earned marks equal to mine.\n\nIt was a surprising thing that I had never thought of it that way before, but I realized that whatever I wasn't, I was smarter than nearly all of those white kids. But apparently I was still not intelligent enough, in their eyes, to become whatever I wanted to be.\n\nIt was then that I began to change -- inside.\n\nI drew away from white people. I came to class, and I answered when called upon. It became a physical strain simply to sit in Mr. Ostrowski's class.\n\nWhere \"nigger\" had slipped off my back before, wherever I heard it now, I stopped and looked at whoever said it. And they looked surprised that I did.\n\nI quit hearing so much \"nigger\" and \"What's wrong?\" -- which was the way I wanted it. Nobody, including the teachers, could decide what had come over me. I knew I was being discussed.\n\nIn a few more weeks, it was that way, too, at the restaurant where I worked washing dishes, and at the Swerlins'.\n\n3.\n\nOne day soon after, Mrs. Swerlin called me into the living room, and there was the state man, Maynard Allen. I knew from their faces that something was about to happen. She told me that none of them could understand why -- after I had done so well in school, and on my job, and living with them, and after everyone in Mason had come to like me -- I had lately begun to make them all feel that I wasn't happy there anymore.\n\nShe said she felt there was no need for me to stay at the detention home any longer, and that arrangements had been made for me to go and live with the Lyons family, who liked me so much.\n\nShe stood up and put out her hand. \"I guess I've asked you a hundred times, Malcolm -- do you want to tell me what's wrong?\"\nI shook her hand, and said, \"Nothing, Mrs. Swerlin.\" Then I went and got my things, and came back down. At the livingroom door I saw her wiping her eyes. I felt very bad. I thanked her and went out in front to Mr. Allen, who took me over to the Lyons'.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Lyons, and their children, during the two months I lived with them -- while finishing eighth grade -- also tried to get me to tell them what was wrong. But somehow I couldn't tell them, either.\n\nI went every Saturday to see my brothers and sisters in Lansing, and almost every other day I wrote to Ella in Boston. Not saying why, I told Ella that I wanted to come there and live.\n\nI don't know how she did it, but she arranged for official custody of me to be transferred from Michigan to Massachusetts, and the very week I finished the eighth grade, I again boarded the Greyhound bus for Boston.\n\nI've thought about that time a lot since then. No physical move in my life has been more pivotal or profound in its repercussions.\n\nIf I had stayed on in Michigan, I would probably have married one of those Negro girls I knew and liked in Lansing. I might have become one of those state capitol building shoeshine boys, or a Lansing Country Club waiter, or gotten one of the other menial jobs which, in those days, among Lansing Negroes, would have been considered \"successful\" -- or even become a carpenter.\n\nWhatever I have done since then, I have driven myself to become a success at it. I've often thought that if Mr. Ostrowski had encouraged me to become a lawyer, I would today probably be among some city's professional black bourgeoisie, sipping cocktails and palming myself off as a community spokesman for and leader of the suffering black masses, while my primary concern would be to grab a few more crumbs from the groaning board of the two-faced whites with whom they're begging to \"integrate.\"\n\nAll praise is due to Allah that I went to Boston when I did. If I hadn't, I'd probably still be a brainwashed black Christian.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/3039434", "artist_names": "Girls Top Qoutes (Ft.

I was there\nFrom college, visiting the son,--the son\nA Walter too,--with others of our set,\nFive others: we were seven at Vivian-place.\nAnd me that morning Walter showed the house,\nGreek, set with busts: from vases in the hall\nFlowers of all heavens, and lovelier than their names,\nGrew side by side; and on the pavement lay\nCarved stones of the Abbey-ruin in the park,\nHuge Ammonites, and the first bones of Time;\nAnd on the tables every clime and age\nJumbled together; celts and calumets,\nClaymore and snowshoe, toys in lava, fans\nOf sandal, amber, ancient rosaries,\nLaborious orient ivory sphere in sphere,\nThe cursed Malayan crease, and battle-clubs\nFrom the isles of palm: and higher on the walls,\nBetwixt the monstrous horns of elk and deer,\nHis own forefathers' arms and armour hung.\n\nAnd 'this' he said 'was Hugh's at Agincourt;\nAnd that was old Sir Ralph's at Ascalon:\nA good knight he! we keep a chronicle\nWith all about him'--which he brought, and I\nDived in a hoard of tales that dealt with knights,\nHalf-legend, half-historic, counts and kings\nWho laid about them at their wills and died;\nAnd mixt with these, a lady, one that armed\nHer own fair head, and sallying through the gate,\nHad beat her foes with slaughter from her walls.\n'O miracle of women,' said the book,\n'O noble heart who, being strait-besieged\nBy this wild king to force her to his wish,\nNor bent, nor broke, nor shunned a soldier's death,\nBut now when all was lost or seemed as lost--\nHer stature more than mortal in the burst\nOf sunrise, her arm lifted, eyes on fire--\nBrake with a blast of trumpets from the gate,\nAnd, falling on them like a thunderbolt,\nShe trampled some beneath her horses' heels,\nAnd some were whelmed with missiles of the wall,\nAnd some were pushed with lances from the rock,\nAnd part were drowned within the whirling brook:\nO miracle of noble womanhood!'\n\nSo sang the gallant glorious chronicle;\nAnd, I all rapt in this, 'Come out,' he said,\n'To the Abbey: there is Aunt Elizabeth\nAnd sister Lilia with the rest.' We went\n(I kept the book and had my finger in it)\nDown through the park: strange was the sight to me;\nFor all the sloping pasture murmured, sown\nWith happy faces and with holiday.\nThere moved the multitude, a thousand heads:\nThe patient leaders of their Institute\nTaught them with facts. One reared a font of stone\nAnd drew, from butts of water on the slope,\nThe fountain of the moment, playing, now\nA twisted snake, and now a rain of pearls,\nOr steep-up spout whereon the gilded ball\nDanced like a wisp: and somewhat lower down\nA man with knobs and wires and vials fired\nA cannon: Echo answered in her sleep\nFrom hollow fields: and here were telescopes\nFor azure views; and there a group of girls\nIn circle waited, whom the electric shock\nDislinked with shrieks and laughter: round the lake\nA little clock-work steamer paddling plied\nAnd shook the lilies: perched about the knolls\nA dozen angry models jetted steam:\nA petty railway ran: a fire-balloon\nRose gem-like up before the dusky groves\nAnd dropt a fairy parachute and past:\nAnd there through twenty posts of telegraph\nThey flashed a saucy message to and fro\nBetween the mimic stations; so that sport\nWent hand in hand with Science; otherwhere\nPure sport; a herd of boys with clamour bowled\nAnd stumped the wicket; babies rolled about\nLike tumbled fruit in grass; and men and maids\nArranged a country dance, and flew through light\nAnd shadow, while the twangling violin\nStruck up with Soldier-laddie, and overhead\nThe broad ambrosial aisles of lofty lime\nMade noise with bees and breeze from end to end.\nStrange was the sight and smacking of the time;\nAnd long we gazed, but satiated at length\nCame to the ruins. High-arched and ivy-claspt,\nOf finest Gothic lighter than a fire,\nThrough one wide chasm of time and frost they gave\nThe park, the crowd, the house; but all within\nThe sward was trim as any garden lawn:\nAnd here we lit on Aunt Elizabeth,\nAnd Lilia with the rest, and lady friends\nFrom neighbour seats: and there was Ralph himself,\nA broken statue propt against the wall,\nAs gay as any. Lilia, wild with sport,\nHalf child half woman as she was, had wound\nA scarf of orange round the stony helm,\nAnd robed the shoulders in a rosy silk,\nThat made the old warrior from his ivied nook\nGlow like a sunbeam: near his tomb a feast\nShone, silver-set; about it lay the guests,\nAnd there we joined them: then the maiden Aunt\nTook this fair day for text, and from it preached\nAn universal culture for the crowd,\nAnd all things great; but we, unworthier, told\nOf college: he had climbed across the spikes,\nAnd he had squeezed himself betwixt the bars,\nAnd he had breathed the Proctor's dogs; and one\nDiscussed his tutor, rough to common men,\nBut honeying at the whisper of a lord;\nAnd one the Master, as a rogue in grain\nVeneered with sanctimonious theory.\nBut while they talked, above their heads I saw\nThe feudal warrior lady-clad; which brought\nMy book to mind: and opening this I read\nOf old Sir Ralph a page or two that rang\nWith tilt and tourney; then the tale of her\nThat drove her foes with slaughter from her walls,\nAnd much I praised her nobleness, and 'Where,'\nAsked Walter, patting Lilia's head (she lay\nBeside him) 'lives there such a woman now?'\n\nQuick answered Lilia 'There are thousands now\nSuch women, but convention beats them down:\nIt is but bringing up; no more than that:\nYou men have done it: how I hate you all!\nAh, were I something great! I wish I were\nSome might poetess, I would shame you then,\nThat love to keep us children! O I wish\nThat I were some great princess, I would build\nFar off from men a college like a man's,\nAnd I would teach them all that men are taught;\nWe are twice as quick!' And here she shook aside\nThe hand that played the patron with her curls.\n\nAnd one said smiling 'Pretty were the sight\nIf our old halls could change their sex, and flaunt\nWith prudes for proctors, dowagers for deans,\nAnd sweet girl-graduates in their golden hair.\nI think they should not wear our rusty gowns,\nBut move as rich as Emperor-moths, or Ralph\nWho shines so in the corner; yet I fear,\nIf there were many Lilias in the brood,\nHowever deep you might embower the nest,\nSome boy would spy it.'\nAt this upon the sward\nShe tapt her tiny silken-sandaled foot:\n'That's your light way; but I would make it death\nFor any male thing but to peep at us.'\n\nPetulant she spoke, and at herself she laughed;\nA rosebud set with little wilful thorns,\nAnd sweet as English air could make her, she:\nBut Walter hailed a score of names upon her,\nAnd 'petty Ogress', and 'ungrateful Puss',\nAnd swore he longed at college, only longed,\nAll else was well, for she-society.\nThey boated and they cricketed; they talked\nAt wine, in clubs, of art, of politics;\nThey lost their weeks; they vext the souls of deans;\nThey rode; they betted; made a hundred friends,\nAnd caught the blossom of the flying terms,\nBut missed the mignonette of Vivian-place,\nThe little hearth-flower Lilia. Thus he spoke,\nPart banter, part affection.\n'True,' she said,\n'We doubt not that. O yes, you missed us much.\nI'll stake my ruby ring upon it you did.'\n\nShe held it out; and as a parrot turns\nUp through gilt wires a crafty loving eye,\nAnd takes a lady's finger with all care,\nAnd bites it for true heart and not for harm,\nSo he with Lilia's. Daintily she shrieked\nAnd wrung it. 'Doubt my word again!' he said.\n'Come, listen! here is proof that you were missed:\nWe seven stayed at Christmas up to read;\nAnd there we took one tutor as to read:\nThe hard-grained Muses of the cube and square\nWere out of season: never man, I think,\nSo mouldered in a sinecure as he:\nFor while our cloisters echoed frosty feet,\nAnd our long walks were stript as bare as brooms,\nWe did but talk you over, pledge you all\nIn wassail; often, like as many girls--\nSick for the hollies and the yews of home--\nAs many little trifling Lilias--played\nCharades and riddles as at Christmas here,\nAnd ~what's my thought~ and ~when~ and ~where~ and ~how~,\nAs here at Christmas.'\nShe remembered that:\nA pleasant game, she thought: she liked it more\nThan magic music, forfeits, all the rest.\nBut these--what kind of tales did men tell men,\nShe wondered, by themselves?\nA half-disdain\nPerched on the pouted blossom of her lips:\nAnd Walter nodded at me; '~He~ began,\nThe rest would follow, each in turn; and so\nWe forged a sevenfold story. Kind? what kind?\nChimeras, crotchets, Christmas solecisms,\nSeven-headed monsters only made to kill\nTime by the fire in winter.'\n'Kill him now,\nThe tyrant! kill him in the summer too,'\nSaid Lilia; 'Why not now?' the maiden Aunt.\n'Why not a summer's as a winter's tale?\nA tale for summer as befits the time,\nAnd something it should be to suit the place,\nHeroic, for a hero lies beneath,\nGrave, solemn!'\nWalter warped his mouth at this\nTo something so mock-solemn, that I laughed\nAnd Lilia woke with sudden-thrilling mirth\nAn echo like a ghostly woodpecker,\nHid in the ruins; till the maiden Aunt\n(A little sense of wrong had touched her face\nWith colour) turned to me with 'As you will;\nHeroic if you will, or what you will,\nOr be yourself you hero if you will.'\n\n'Take Lilia, then, for heroine' clamoured he,\n'And make her some great Princess, six feet high,\nGrand, epic, homicidal; and be you\nThe Prince to win her!'\n'Then follow me, the Prince,'\nI answered, 'each be hero in his turn!\nSeven and yet one, like shadows in a dream.--\nHeroic seems our Princess as required--\nBut something made to suit with Time and place,\nA Gothic ruin and a Grecian house,\nA talk of college and of ladies' rights,\nA feudal knight in silken masquerade,\nAnd, yonder, shrieks and strange experiments\nFor which the good Sir Ralph had burnt them all--\nThis ~were~ a medley! we should have him back\nWho told the \"Winter's tale\" to do it for us.\nNo matter: we will say whatever comes.\nAnd let the ladies sing us, if they will,\nFrom time to time, some ballad or a song\nTo give us breathing-space.'\nSo I began,\nAnd the rest followed: and the women sang\nBetween the rougher voices of the men,\nLike linnets in the pauses of the wind:\nAnd here I give the story and the songs.\n\nI\n\nA prince I was, blue-eyed, and fair in face,\nOf temper amorous, as the first of May,\nWith lengths of yellow ringlet, like a girl,\nFor on my cradle shone the Northern star.\n\nThere lived an ancient legend in our house.\nSome sorcerer, whom a far-off grandsire burnt\nBecause he cast no shadow, had foretold,\nDying, that none of all our blood should know\nThe shadow from the substance, and that one\nShould come to fight with shadows and to fall.\nFor so, my mother said, the story ran.\nAnd, truly, waking dreams were, more or less,\nAn old and strange affection of the house.\nMyself too had weird seizures, Heaven knows what:\nOn a sudden in the midst of men and day,\nAnd while I walked and talked as heretofore,\nI seemed to move among a world of ghosts,\nAnd feel myself the shadow of a dream.\nOur great court-Galen poised his gilt-head cane,\nAnd pawed his beard, and muttered 'catalepsy'.\nMy mother pitying made a thousand prayers;\nMy mother was as mild as any saint,\nHalf-canonized by all that looked on her,\nSo gracious was her tact and tenderness:\nBut my good father thought a king a king;\nHe cared not for the affection of the house;\nHe held his sceptre like a pedant's wand\nTo lash offence, and with long arms and hands\nReached out, and picked offenders from the mass\nFor judgment.\nNow it chanced that I had been,\nWhile life was yet in bud and blade, bethrothed\nTo one, a neighbouring Princess: she to me\nWas proxy-wedded with a bootless calf\nAt eight years old; and still from time to time\nCame murmurs of her beauty from the South,\nAnd of her brethren, youths of puissance;\nAnd still I wore her picture by my heart,\nAnd one dark tress; and all around them both\nSweet thoughts would swarm as bees about their queen.\n\nBut when the days drew nigh that I should wed,\nMy father sent ambassadors with furs\nAnd jewels, gifts, to fetch her: these brought back\nA present, a great labour of the loom;\nAnd therewithal an answer vague as wind:\nBesides, they saw the king; he took the gifts;\nHe said there was a compact; that was true:\nBut then she had a will; was he to blame?\nAnd maiden fancies; loved to live alone\nAmong her women; certain, would not wed.\n\nThat morning in the presence room I stood\nWith Cyril and with Florian, my two friends:\nThe first, a gentleman of broken means\n(His father's fault) but given to starts and bursts\nOf revel; and the last, my other heart,\nAnd almost my half-self, for still we moved\nTogether, twinned as horse's ear and eye.\n\nNow, while they spake, I saw my father's face\nGrow long and troubled like a rising moon,\nInflamed with wrath: he started on his feet,\nTore the king's letter, snowed it down, and rent\nThe wonder of the loom through warp and woof\nFrom skirt to skirt; and at the last he sware\nThat he would send a hundred thousand men,\nAnd bring her in a whirlwind: then he chewed\nThe thrice-turned cud of wrath, and cooked his spleen,\nCommuning with his captains of the war.\n\nAt last I spoke. 'My father, let me go.\nIt cannot be but some gross error lies\nIn this report, this answer of a king,\nWhom all men rate as kind and hospitable:\nOr, maybe, I myself, my bride once seen,\nWhate'er my grief to find her less than fame,\nMay rue the bargain made.' And Florian said:\n'I have a sister at the foreign court,\nWho moves about the Princess; she, you know,\nWho wedded with a nobleman from thence:\nHe, dying lately, left her, as I hear,\nThe lady of three castles in that land:\nThrough her this matter might be sifted clean.'\nAnd Cyril whispered: 'Take me with you too.'\nThen laughing 'what, if these weird seizures come\nUpon you in those lands, and no one near\nTo point you out the shadow from the truth!\nTake me: I'll serve you better in a strait;\nI grate on rusty hinges here:' but 'No!'\nRoared the rough king, 'you shall not; we ourself\nWill crush her pretty maiden fancies dead\nIn iron gauntlets: break the council up.'\n\nBut when the council broke, I rose and past\nThrough the wild woods that hung about the town;\nFound a still place, and plucked her likeness out;\nLaid it on flowers, and watched it lying bathed\nIn the green gleam of dewy-tasselled trees:\nWhat were those fancies? wherefore break her troth?\nProud looked the lips: but while I meditated\nA wind arose and rushed upon the South,\nAnd shook the songs, the whispers, and the shrieks\nOf the wild woods together; and a Voice\nWent with it, 'Follow, follow, thou shalt win.'\n\nThen, ere the silver sickle of that month\nBecame her golden shield, I stole from court\nWith Cyril and with Florian, unperceived,\nCat-footed through the town and half in dread\nTo hear my father's clamour at our backs\nWith Ho! from some bay-window shake the night;\nBut all was quiet: from the bastioned walls\nLike threaded spiders, one by one, we dropt,\nAnd flying reached the frontier: then we crost\nTo a livelier land; and so by tilth and grange,\nAnd vines, and blowing bosks of wilderness,\nWe gained the mother city thick with towers,\nAnd in the imperial palace found the king.\n\nHis name was Gama; cracked and small his voice,\nBut bland the smile that like a wrinkling wind\nOn glassy water drove his cheek in lines;\nA little dry old man, without a star,\nNot like a king: three days he feasted us,\nAnd on the fourth I spake of why we came,\nAnd my bethrothed. 'You do us, Prince,' he said,\nAiring a snowy hand and signet gem,\n'All honour. We remember love ourselves\nIn our sweet youth: there did a compact pass\nLong summers back, a kind of ceremony--\nI think the year in which our olives failed.\nI would you had her, Prince, with all my heart,\nWith my full heart: but there were widows here,\nTwo widows, Lady Psyche, Lady Blanche;\nThey fed her theories, in and out of place\nMaintaining that with equal husbandry\nThe woman were an equal to the man.\nThey harped on this; with this our banquets rang;\nOur dances broke and buzzed in knots of talk;\nNothing but this; my very ears were hot\nTo hear them: knowledge, so my daughter held,\nWas all in all: they had but been, she thought,\nAs children; they must lose the child, assume\nThe woman: then, Sir, awful odes she wrote,\nToo awful, sure, for what they treated of,\nBut all she is and does is awful; odes\nAbout this losing of the child; and rhymes\nAnd dismal lyrics, prophesying change\nBeyond all reason: these the women sang;\nAnd they that know such things--I sought but peace;\nNo critic I--would call them masterpieces:\nThey mastered ~me~. At last she begged a boon,\nA certain summer-palace which I have\nHard by your father's frontier: I said no,\nYet being an easy man, gave it: and there,\nAll wild to found an University\nFor maidens, on the spur she fled; and more\nWe know not,--only this: they see no men,\nNot even her brother Arac, nor the twins\nHer brethren, though they love her, look upon her\nAs on a kind of paragon; and I\n(Pardon me saying it) were much loth to breed\nDispute betwixt myself and mine: but since\n(And I confess with right) you think me bound\nIn some sort, I can give you letters to her;\nAnd yet, to speak the truth, I rate your chance\nAlmost at naked nothing.'\nThus the king;\nAnd I, though nettled that he seemed to slur\nWith garrulous ease and oily courtesies\nOur formal compact, yet, not less (all frets\nBut chafing me on fire to find my bride)\nWent forth again with both my friends. We rode\nMany a long league back to the North. At last\nFrom hills, that looked across a land of hope,\nWe dropt with evening on a rustic town\nSet in a gleaming river's crescent-curve,\nClose at the boundary of the liberties;\nThere, entered an old hostel, called mine host\nTo council, plied him with his richest wines,\nAnd showed the late-writ letters of the king.\n\nHe with a long low sibilation, stared\nAs blank as death in marble; then exclaimed\nAverring it was clear against all rules\nFor any man to go: but as his brain\nBegan to mellow, 'If the king,' he said,\n'Had given us letters, was he bound to speak?\nThe king would bear him out;' and at the last--\nThe summer of the vine in all his veins--\n'No doubt that we might make it worth his while.\nShe once had past that way; he heard her speak;\nShe scared him; life! he never saw the like;\nShe looked as grand as doomsday and as grave:\nAnd he, he reverenced his liege-lady there;\nHe always made a point to post with mares;\nHis daughter and his housemaid were the boys:\nThe land, he understood, for miles about\nWas tilled by women; all the swine were sows,\nAnd all the dogs'--\nBut while he jested thus,\nA thought flashed through me which I clothed in act,\nRemembering how we three presented Maid\nOr Nymph, or Goddess, at high tide of feast,\nIn masque or pageant at my father's court.\nWe sent mine host to purchase female gear;\nHe brought it, and himself, a sight to shake\nThe midriff of despair with laughter, holp\nTo lace us up, till, each, in maiden plumes\nWe rustled: him we gave a costly bribe\nTo guerdon silence, mounted our good steeds,\nAnd boldly ventured on the liberties.\n\nWe followed up the river as we rode,\nAnd rode till midnight when the college lights\nBegan to glitter firefly-like in copse\nAnd linden alley: then we past an arch,\nWhereon a woman-statue rose with wings\nFrom four winged horses dark against the stars;\nAnd some inscription ran along the front,\nBut deep in shadow: further on we gained\nA little street half garden and half house;\nBut scarce could hear each other speak for noise\nOf clocks and chimes, like silver hammers falling\nOn silver anvils, and the splash and stir\nOf fountains spouted up and showering down\nIn meshes of the jasmine and the rose:\nAnd all about us pealed the nightingale,\nRapt in her song, and careless of the snare.\n\nThere stood a bust of Pallas for a sign,\nBy two sphere lamps blazoned like Heaven and Earth\nWith constellation and with continent,\nAbove an entry: riding in, we called;\nA plump-armed Ostleress and a stable wench\nCame running at the call, and helped us down.\nThen stept a buxom hostess forth, and sailed,\nFull-blown, before us into rooms which gave\nUpon a pillared porch, the bases lost\nIn laurel: her we asked of that and this,\nAnd who were tutors. 'Lady Blanche' she said,\n'And Lady Psyche.' 'Which was prettiest,\nBest-natured?' 'Lady Psyche.' 'Hers are we,'\nOne voice, we cried; and I sat down and wrote,\nIn such a hand as when a field of corn\nBows all its ears before the roaring East;\n\n'Three ladies of the Northern empire pray\nYour Highness would enroll them with your own,\nAs Lady Psyche's pupils.'\nThis I sealed:\nThe seal was Cupid bent above a scroll,\nAnd o'er his head Uranian Venus hung,\nAnd raised the blinding bandage from his eyes:\nI gave the letter to be sent with dawn;\nAnd then to bed, where half in doze I seemed\nTo float about a glimmering night, and watch\nA full sea glazed with muffled moonlight, swell\nOn some dark shore just seen that it was rich.\n\nAs through the land at eve we went,\nAnd plucked the ripened ears,\nWe fell out, my wife and I,\nO we fell out I know not why,\nAnd kissed again with tears.\nAnd blessings on the falling out\nThat all the more endears,\nWhen we fall out with those we love\nAnd kiss again with tears!\nFor when we came where lies the child\nWe lost in other years,\nThere above the little grave,\nO there above the little grave,\nWe kissed again with tears.\n\nII\n\nAt break of day the College Portress came:\nShe brought us Academic silks, in hue\nThe lilac, with a silken hood to each,\nAnd zoned with gold; and now when these were on,\nAnd we as rich as moths from dusk cocoons,\nShe, curtseying her obeisance, let us know\nThe Princess Ida waited: out we paced,\nI first, and following through the porch that sang\nAll round with laurel, issued in a court\nCompact of lucid marbles, bossed with lengths\nOf classic frieze, with ample awnings gay\nBetwixt the pillars, and with great urns of flowers.\nThe Muses and the Graces, grouped in threes,\nEnringed a billowing fountain in the midst;\nAnd here and there on lattice edges lay\nOr book or lute; but hastily we past,\nAnd up a flight of stairs into the hall.\n\nThere at a board by tome and paper sat,\nWith two tame leopards couched beside her throne,\nAll beauty compassed in a female form,\nThe Princess; liker to the inhabitant\nOf some clear planet close upon the Sun,\nThan our man's earth; such eyes were in her head,\nAnd so much grace and power, breathing down\nFrom over her arched brows, with every turn\nLived through her to the tips of her long hands,\nAnd to her feet. She rose her height, and said:\n\n'We give you welcome: not without redound\nOf use and glory to yourselves ye come,\nThe first-fruits of the stranger: aftertime,\nAnd that full voice which circles round the grave,\nWill rank you nobly, mingled up with me.\nWhat! are the ladies of your land so tall?'\n'We of the court' said Cyril. 'From the court'\nShe answered, 'then ye know the Prince?' and he:\n'The climax of his age! as though there were\nOne rose in all the world, your Highness that,\nHe worships your ideal:' she replied:\n'We scarcely thought in our own hall to hear\nThis barren verbiage, current among men,\nLight coin, the tinsel clink of compliment.\nYour flight from out your bookless wilds would seem\nAs arguing love of knowledge and of power;\nYour language proves you still the child. Indeed,\nWe dream not of him: when we set our hand\nTo this great work, we purposed with ourself\nNever to wed. You likewise will do well,\nLadies, in entering here, to cast and fling\nThe tricks, which make us toys of men, that so,\nSome future time, if so indeed you will,\nYou may with those self-styled our lords ally\nYour fortunes, justlier balanced, scale with scale.'\n\nAt those high words, we conscious of ourselves,\nPerused the matting: then an officer\nRose up, and read the statutes, such as these:\nNot for three years to correspond with home;\nNot for three years to cross the liberties;\nNot for three years to speak with any men;\nAnd many more, which hastily subscribed,\nWe entered on the boards: and 'Now,' she cried,\n'Ye are green wood, see ye warp not. Look, our hall!\nOur statues!--not of those that men desire,\nSleek Odalisques, or oracles of mode,\nNor stunted squaws of West or East; but she\nThat taught the Sabine how to rule, and she\nThe foundress of the Babylonian wall,\nThe Carian Artemisia strong in war,\nThe Rhodope, that built the pyramid,\nClelia, Cornelia, with the Palmyrene\nThat fought Aurelian, and the Roman brows\nOf Agrippina. Dwell with these, and lose\nConvention, since to look on noble forms\nMakes noble through the sensuous organism\nThat which is higher. O lift your natures up:\nEmbrace our aims: work out your freedom. Girls,\nKnowledge is now no more a fountain sealed:\nDrink deep, until the habits of the slave,\nThe sins of emptiness, gossip and spite\nAnd slander, die. Better not be at all\nThan not be noble. Leave us: you may go:\nToday the Lady Psyche will harangue\nThe fresh arrivals of the week before;\nFor they press in from all the provinces,\nAnd fill the hive.'\nShe spoke, and bowing waved\nDismissal: back again we crost the court\nTo Lady Psyche's: as we entered in,\nThere sat along the forms, like morning doves\nThat sun their milky bosoms on the thatch,\nA patient range of pupils; she herself\nErect behind a desk of satin-wood,\nA quick brunette, well-moulded, falcon-eyed,\nAnd on the hither side, or so she looked,\nOf twenty summers. At her left, a child,\nIn shining draperies, headed like a star,\nHer maiden babe, a double April old,\nAgla\u00efa slept. We sat: the Lady glanced:\nThen Florian, but not livelier than the dame\nThat whispered 'Asses' ears', among the sedge,\n'My sister.' 'Comely, too, by all that's fair,'\nSaid Cyril. 'Oh hush, hush!' and she began.\n\n'This world was once a fluid haze of light,\nTill toward the centre set the starry tides,\nAnd eddied into suns, that wheeling cast\nThe planets: then the monster, then the man;\nTattooed or woaded, winter-clad in skins,\nRaw from the prime, and crushing down his mate;\nAs yet we find in barbarous isles, and here\nAmong the lowest.'\nThereupon she took\nA bird's-eye-view of all the ungracious past;\nGlanced at the legendary Amazon\nAs emblematic of a nobler age;\nAppraised the Lycian custom, spoke of those\nThat lay at wine with Lar and Lucumo;\nRan down the Persian, Grecian, Roman lines\nOf empire, and the woman's state in each,\nHow far from just; till warming with her theme\nShe fulmined out her scorn of laws Salique\nAnd little-footed China, touched on Mahomet\nWith much contempt, and came to chivalry:\nWhen some respect, however slight, was paid\nTo woman, superstition all awry:\nHowever then commenced the dawn: a beam\nHad slanted forward, falling in a land\nOf promise; fruit would follow. Deep, indeed,\nTheir debt of thanks to her who first had dared\nTo leap the rotten pales of prejudice,\nDisyoke their necks from custom, and assert\nNone lordlier than themselves but that which made\nWoman and man. She had founded; they must build.\nHere might they learn whatever men were taught:\nLet them not fear: some said their heads were less:\nSome men's were small; not they the least of men;\nFor often fineness compensated size:\nBesides the brain was like the hand, and grew\nWith using; thence the man's, if more was more;\nHe took advantage of his strength to be\nFirst in the field: some ages had been lost;\nBut woman ripened earlier, and her life\nWas longer; and albeit their glorious names\nWere fewer, scattered stars, yet since in truth\nThe highest is the measure of the man,\nAnd not the Kaffir, Hottentot, Malay,\nNor those horn-handed breakers of the glebe,\nBut Homer, Plato, Verulam; even so\nWith woman: and in arts of government\nElizabeth and others; arts of war\nThe peasant Joan and others; arts of grace\nSappho and others vied with any man:\nAnd, last not least, she who had left her place,\nAnd bowed her state to them, that they might grow\nTo use and power on this Oasis, lapt\nIn the arms of leisure, sacred from the blight\nOf ancient influence and scorn.\nAt last\nShe rose upon a wind of prophecy\nDilating on the future; 'everywhere\nWho heads in council, two beside the hearth,\nTwo in the tangled business of the world,\nTwo in the liberal offices of life,\nTwo plummets dropt for one to sound the abyss\nOf science, and the secrets of the mind:\nMusician, painter, sculptor, critic, more:\nAnd everywhere the broad and bounteous Earth\nShould bear a double growth of those rare souls,\nPoets, whose thoughts enrich the blood of the world.'\n\nShe ended here, and beckoned us: the rest\nParted; and, glowing full-faced welcome, she\nBegan to address us, and was moving on\nIn gratulation, till as when a boat\nTacks, and the slackened sail flaps, all her voice\nFaltering and fluttering in her throat, she cried\n'My brother!' 'Well, my sister.' 'O,' she said,\n'What do you here? and in this dress? and these?\nWhy who are these? a wolf within the fold!\nA pack of wolves! the Lord be gracious to me!\nA plot, a plot, a plot to ruin all!'\n'No plot, no plot,' he answered. 'Wretched boy,\nHow saw you not the inscription on the gate,\nLET NO MAN ENTER IN ON PAIN OF DEATH?'\n'And if I had,' he answered, 'who could think\nThe softer Adams of your Academe,\nO sister, Sirens though they be, were such\nAs chanted on the blanching bones of men?'\n'But you will find it otherwise' she said.\n'You jest: ill jesting with edge-tools! my vow\nBinds me to speak, and O that iron will,\nThat axelike edge unturnable, our Head,\nThe Princess.' 'Well then, Psyche, take my life,\nAnd nail me like a weasel on a grange\nFor warning: bury me beside the gate,\nAnd cut this epitaph above my bones;\n~Here lies a brother by a sister slain,\nAll for the common good of womankind.~'\n'Let me die too,' said Cyril, 'having seen\nAnd heard the Lady Psyche.'\nI struck in:\n'Albeit so masked, Madam, I love the truth;\nReceive it; and in me behold the Prince\nYour countryman, affianced years ago\nTo the Lady Ida: here, for here she was,\nAnd thus (what other way was left) I came.'\n'O Sir, O Prince, I have no country; none;\nIf any, this; but none. Whate'er I was\nDisrooted, what I am is grafted here.\nAffianced, Sir? love-whispers may not breathe\nWithin this vestal limit, and how should I,\nWho am not mine, say, live: the thunderbolt\nHangs silent; but prepare: I speak; it falls.'\n'Yet pause,' I said: 'for that inscription there,\nI think no more of deadly lurks therein,\nThan in a clapper clapping in a garth,\nTo scare the fowl from fruit: if more there be,\nIf more and acted on, what follows? war;\nYour own work marred: for this your Academe,\nWhichever side be Victor, in the halloo\nWill topple to the trumpet down, and pass\nWith all fair theories only made to gild\nA stormless summer.' 'Let the Princess judge\nOf that' she said: 'farewell, Sir--and to you.\nI shudder at the sequel, but I go.'\n\n'Are you that Lady Psyche,' I rejoined,\n'The fifth in line from that old Florian,\nYet hangs his portrait in my father's hall\n(The gaunt old Baron with his beetle brow\nSun-shaded in the heat of dusty fights)\nAs he bestrode my Grandsire, when he fell,\nAnd all else fled? we point to it, and we say,\nThe loyal warmth of Florian is not cold,\nBut branches current yet in kindred veins.'\n'Are you that Psyche,' Florian added; 'she\nWith whom I sang about the morning hills,\nFlung ball, flew kite, and raced the purple fly,\nAnd snared the squirrel of the glen? are you\nThat Psyche, won't to bind my throbbing brow,\nTo smoothe my pillow, mix the foaming draught\nOf fever, tell me pleasant tales, and read\nMy sickness down to happy dreams? are you\nThat brother-sister Psyche, both in one?\nYou were that Psyche, but what are you now?'\n'You are that Psyche,' said Cyril, 'for whom\nI would be that for ever which I seem,\nWoman, if I might sit beside your feet,\nAnd glean your scattered sapience.'\nThen once more,\n'Are you that Lady Psyche,' I began,\n'That on her bridal morn before she past\nFrom all her old companions, when the kind\nKissed her pale cheek, declared that ancient ties\nWould still be dear beyond the southern hills;\nThat were there any of our people there\nIn want or peril, there was one to hear\nAnd help them? look! for such are these and I.'\n'Are you that Psyche,' Florian asked, 'to whom,\nIn gentler days, your arrow-wounded fawn\nCame flying while you sat beside the well?\nThe creature laid his muzzle on your lap,\nAnd sobbed, and you sobbed with it, and the blood\nWas sprinkled on your kirtle, and you wept.\nThat was fawn's blood, not brother's, yet you wept.\nO by the bright head of my little niece,\nYou were that Psyche, and what are you now?'\n'You are that Psyche,' Cyril said again,\n'The mother of the sweetest little maid,\nThat ever crowed for kisses.'\n'Out upon it!'\nShe answered, 'peace! and why should I not play\nThe Spartan Mother with emotion, be\nThe Lucius Junius Brutus of my kind?\nHim you call great: he for the common weal,\nThe fading politics of mortal Rome,\nAs I might slay this child, if good need were,\nSlew both his sons: and I, shall I, on whom\nThe secular emancipation turns\nOf half this world, be swerved from right to save\nA prince, a brother? a little will I yield.\nBest so, perchance, for us, and well for you.\nO hard, when love and duty clash! I fear\nMy conscience will not count me fleckless; yet--\nHear my conditions: promise (otherwise\nYou perish) as you came, to slip away\nToday, tomorrow, soon: it shall be said,\nThese women were too barbarous, would not learn;\nThey fled, who might have shamed us: promise, all.'\n\nWhat could we else, we promised each; and she,\nLike some wild creature newly-caged, commenced\nA to-and-fro, so pacing till she paused\nBy Florian; holding out her lily arms\nTook both his hands, and smiling faintly said:\n'I knew you at the first: though you have grown\nYou scarce have altered: I am sad and glad\nTo see you, Florian. ~I~ give thee to death\nMy brother! it was duty spoke, not I.\nMy needful seeming harshness, pardon it.\nOur mother, is she well?'\nWith that she kissed\nHis forehead, then, a moment after, clung\nAbout him, and betwixt them blossomed up\nFrom out a common vein of memory\nSweet household talk, and phrases of the hearth,\nAnd far allusion, till the gracious dews\nBegan to glisten and to fall: and while\nThey stood, so rapt, we gazing, came a voice,\n'I brought a message here from Lady Blanche.'\nBack started she, and turning round we saw\nThe Lady Blanche's daughter where she stood,\nMelissa, with her hand upon the lock,\nA rosy blonde, and in a college gown,\nThat clad her like an April daffodilly\n(Her mother's colour) with her lips apart,\nAnd all her thoughts as fair within her eyes,\nAs bottom agates seen to wave and float\nIn crystal currents of clear morning seas.\n\nSo stood that same fair creature at the door.\nThen Lady Psyche, 'Ah--Melissa--you!\nYou heard us?' and Melissa, 'O pardon me\nI heard, I could not help it, did not wish:\nBut, dearest Lady, pray you fear me not,\nNor think I bear that heart within my breast,\nTo give three gallant gentlemen to death.'\n'I trust you,' said the other, 'for we two\nWere always friends, none closer, elm and vine:\nBut yet your mother's jealous temperament--\nLet not your prudence, dearest, drowse, or prove\nThe Dana\u00efd of a leaky vase, for fear\nThis whole foundation ruin, and I lose\nMy honour, these their lives.' 'Ah, fear me not'\nReplied Melissa; 'no--I would not tell,\nNo, not for all Aspasia's cleverness,\nNo, not to answer, Madam, all those hard things\nThat Sheba came to ask of Solomon.'\n'Be it so' the other, 'that we still may lead\nThe new light up, and culminate in peace,\nFor Solomon may come to Sheba yet.'\nSaid Cyril, 'Madam, he the wisest man\nFeasted the woman wisest then, in halls\nOf Lebanonian cedar: nor should you\n(Though, Madam, ~you~ should answer, ~we~ would ask)\nLess welcome find among us, if you came\nAmong us, debtors for our lives to you,\nMyself for something more.' He said not what,\nBut 'Thanks,' she answered 'Go: we have been too long\nTogether: keep your hoods about the face;\nThey do so that affect abstraction here.\nSpeak little; mix not with the rest; and hold\nYour promise: all, I trust, may yet be well.'\n\nWe turned to go, but Cyril took the child,\nAnd held her round the knees against his waist,\nAnd blew the swollen cheek of a trumpeter,\nWhile Psyche watched them, smiling, and the child\nPushed her flat hand against his face and laughed;\nAnd thus our conference closed.\nAnd then we strolled\nFor half the day through stately theatres\nBenched crescent-wise. In each we sat, we heard\nThe grave Professor. On the lecture slate\nThe circle rounded under female hands\nWith flawless demonstration: followed then\nA classic lecture, rich in sentiment,\nWith scraps of thunderous Epic lilted out\nBy violet-hooded Doctors, elegies\nAnd quoted odes, and jewels five-words-long\nThat on the stretched forefinger of all Time\nSparkle for ever: then we dipt in all\nThat treats of whatsoever is, the state,\nThe total chronicles of man, the mind,\nThe morals, something of the frame, the rock,\nThe star, the bird, the fish, the shell, the flower,\nElectric, chemic laws, and all the rest,\nAnd whatsoever can be taught and known;\nTill like three horses that have broken fence,\nAnd glutted all night long breast-deep in corn,\nWe issued gorged with knowledge, and I spoke:\n'Why, Sirs, they do all this as well as we.'\n'They hunt old trails' said Cyril 'very well;\nBut when did woman ever yet invent?'\n'Ungracious!' answered Florian; 'have you learnt\nNo more from Psyche's lecture, you that talked\nThe trash that made me sick, and almost sad?'\n'O trash' he said, 'but with a kernel in it.\nShould I not call her wise, who made me wise?\nAnd learnt? I learnt more from her in a flash,\nThan in my brainpan were an empty hull,\nAnd every Muse tumbled a science in.\nA thousand hearts lie fallow in these halls,\nAnd round these halls a thousand baby loves\nFly twanging headless arrows at the hearts,\nWhence follows many a vacant pang; but O\nWith me, Sir, entered in the bigger boy,\nThe Head of all the golden-shafted firm,\nThe long-limbed lad that had a Psyche too;\nHe cleft me through the stomacher; and now\nWhat think you of it, Florian? do I chase\nThe substance or the shadow? will it hold?\nI have no sorcerer's malison on me,\nNo ghostly hauntings like his Highness. I\nFlatter myself that always everywhere\nI know the substance when I see it. Well,\nAre castles shadows? Three of them? Is she\nThe sweet proprietress a shadow? If not,\nShall those three castles patch my tattered coat?\nFor dear are those three castles to my wants,\nAnd dear is sister Psyche to my heart,\nAnd two dear things are one of double worth,\nAnd much I might have said, but that my zone\nUnmanned me: then the Doctors! O to hear\nThe Doctors! O to watch the thirsty plants\nImbibing! once or twice I thought to roar,\nTo break my chain, to shake my mane: but thou,\nModulate me, Soul of mincing mimicry!\nMake liquid treble of that bassoon, my throat;\nAbase those eyes that ever loved to meet\nStar-sisters answering under crescent brows;\nAbate the stride, which speaks of man, and loose\nA flying charm of blushes o'er this cheek,\nWhere they like swallows coming out of time\nWill wonder why they came: but hark the bell\nFor dinner, let us go!'\nAnd in we streamed\nAmong the columns, pacing staid and still\nBy twos and threes, till all from end to end\nWith beauties every shade of brown and fair\nIn colours gayer than the morning mist,\nThe long hall glittered like a bed of flowers.\nHow might a man not wander from his wits\nPierced through with eyes, but that I kept mine own\nIntent on her, who rapt in glorious dreams,\nThe second-sight of some Astr\u00e6an age,\nSat compassed with professors: they, the while,\nDiscussed a doubt and tost it to and fro:\nA clamour thickened, mixt with inmost terms\nOf art and science: Lady Blanche alone\nOf faded form and haughtiest lineaments,\nWith all her autumn tresses falsely brown,\nShot sidelong daggers at us, a tiger-cat\nIn act to spring.\nAt last a solemn grace\nConcluded, and we sought the gardens: there\nOne walked reciting by herself, and one\nIn this hand held a volume as to read,\nAnd smoothed a petted peacock down with that:\nSome to a low song oared a shallop by,\nOr under arches of the marble bridge\nHung, shadowed from the heat: some hid and sought\nIn the orange thickets: others tost a ball\nAbove the fountain-jets, and back again\nWith laughter: others lay about the lawns,\nOf the older sort, and murmured that their May\nWas passing: what was learning unto them?\nThey wished to marry; they could rule a house;\nMen hated learned women: but we three\nSat muffled like the Fates; and often came\nMelissa hitting all we saw with shafts\nOf gentle satire, kin to charity,\nThat harmed not: then day droopt; the chapel bells\nCalled us: we left the walks; we mixt with those\nSix hundred maidens clad in purest white,\nBefore two streams of light from wall to wall,\nWhile the great organ almost burst his pipes,\nGroaning for power, and rolling through the court\nA long melodious thunder to the sound\nOf solemn psalms, and silver litanies,\nThe work of Ida, to call down from Heaven\nA blessing on her labours for the world.\n\nSweet and low, sweet and low,\nWind of the western sea,\nLow, low, breathe and blow,\nWind of the western sea!\nOver the rolling waters go,\nCome from the dying moon, and blow,\nBlow him again to me;\nWhile my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps.\n\nSleep and rest, sleep and rest,\nFather will come to thee soon;\nRest, rest, on mother's breast,\nFather will come to thee soon;\nFather will come to his babe in the nest,\nSilver sails all out of the west\nUnder the silver moon:\nSleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep.\n\nIII\n\nMorn in the wake of the morning star\nCame furrowing all the orient into gold.\nWe rose, and each by other drest with care\nDescended to the court that lay three parts\nIn shadow, but the Muses' heads were touched\nAbove the darkness from their native East.\n\nThere while we stood beside the fount, and watched\nOr seemed to watch the dancing bubble, approached\nMelissa, tinged with wan from lack of sleep,\nOr grief, and glowing round her dewy eyes\nThe circled Iris of a night of tears;\n'And fly,' she cried, 'O fly, while yet you may!\nMy mother knows:' and when I asked her 'how,'\n'My fault' she wept 'my fault! and yet not mine;\nYet mine in part. O hear me, pardon me.\nMy mother, 'tis her won't from night to night\nTo rail at Lady Psyche and her side.\nShe says the Princess should have been the Head,\nHerself and Lady Psyche the two arms;\nAnd so it was agreed when first they came;\nBut Lady Psyche was the right hand now,\nAnd the left, or not, or seldom used;\nHers more than half the students, all the love.\nAnd so last night she fell to canvass you:\n~Her~ countrywomen! she did not envy her.\n\"Who ever saw such wild barbarians?\nGirls?--more like men!\" and at these words the snake,\nMy secret, seemed to stir within my breast;\nAnd oh, Sirs, could I help it, but my cheek\nBegan to burn and burn, and her lynx eye\nTo fix and make me hotter, till she laughed:\n\"O marvellously modest maiden, you!\nMen! girls, like men! why, if they had been men\nYou need not set your thoughts in rubric thus\nFor wholesale comment.\" Pardon, I am shamed\nThat I must needs repeat for my excuse\nWhat looks so little graceful: \"men\" (for still\nMy mother went revolving on the word)\n\"And so they are,--very like men indeed--\nAnd with that woman closeted for hours!\"\nThen came these dreadful words out one by one,\n\"Why--these--~are~--men:\" I shuddered: \"and you know it.\"\n\"O ask me nothing,\" I said: \"And she knows too,\nAnd she conceals it.\" So my mother clutched\nThe truth at once, but with no word from me;\nAnd now thus early risen she goes to inform\nThe Princess: Lady Psyche will be crushed;\nBut you may yet be saved, and therefore fly;\nBut heal me with your pardon ere you go.'\n\n'What pardon, sweet Melissa, for a blush?'\nSaid Cyril: 'Pale one, blush again: than wear\nThose lilies, better blush our lives away.\nYet let us breathe for one hour more in Heaven'\nHe added, 'lest some classic Angel speak\nIn scorn of us, \"They mounted, Ganymedes,\nTo tumble, Vulcans, on the second morn.\"\nBut I will melt this marble into wax\nTo yield us farther furlough:' and he went.\n\nMelissa shook her doubtful curls, and thought\nHe scarce would prosper. 'Tell us,' Florian asked,\n'How grew this feud betwixt the right and left.'\n'O long ago,' she said, 'betwixt these two\nDivision smoulders hidden; 'tis my mother,\nToo jealous, often fretful as the wind\nPent in a crevice: much I bear with her:\nI never knew my father, but she says\n(God help her) she was wedded to a fool;\nAnd still she railed against the state of things.\nShe had the care of Lady Ida's youth,\nAnd from the Queen's decease she brought her up.\nBut when your sister came she won the heart\nOf Ida: they were still together, grew\n(For so they said themselves) inosculated;\nConsonant chords that shiver to one note;\nOne mind in all things: yet my mother still\nAffirms your Psyche thieved her theories,\nAnd angled with them for her pupil's love:\nShe calls her plagiarist; I know not what:\nBut I must go: I dare not tarry,' and light,\nAs flies the shadow of a bird, she fled.\n\nThen murmured Florian gazing after her,\n'An open-hearted maiden, true and pure.\nIf I could love, why this were she: how pretty\nHer blushing was, and how she blushed again,\nAs if to close with Cyril's random wish:\nNot like your Princess crammed with erring pride,\nNor like poor Psyche whom she drags in tow.'\n\n'The crane,' I said, 'may chatter of the crane,\nThe dove may murmur of the dove, but I\nAn eagle clang an eagle to the sphere.\nMy princess, O my princess! true she errs,\nBut in her own grand way: being herself\nThree times more noble than three score of men,\nShe sees herself in every woman else,\nAnd so she wears her error like a crown\nTo blind the truth and me: for her, and her,\nHebes are they to hand ambrosia, mix\nThe nectar; but--ah she--whene'er she moves\nThe Samian Her\u00e8 rises and she speaks\nA Memnon smitten with the morning Sun.'\n\nSo saying from the court we paced, and gained\nThe terrace ranged along the Northern front,\nAnd leaning there on those balusters, high\nAbove the empurpled champaign, drank the gale\nThat blown about the foliage underneath,\nAnd sated with the innumerable rose,\nBeat balm upon our eyelids. Hither came\nCyril, and yawning 'O hard task,' he cried;\n'No fighting shadows here! I forced a way\nThrough opposition crabbed and gnarled.\nBetter to clear prime forests, heave and thump\nA league of street in summer solstice down,\nThan hammer at this reverend gentlewoman.\nI knocked and, bidden, entered; found her there\nAt point to move, and settled in her eyes\nThe green malignant light of coming storm.\nSir, I was courteous, every phrase well-oiled,\nAs man's could be; yet maiden-meek I prayed\nConcealment: she demanded who we were,\nAnd why we came? I fabled nothing fair,\nBut, your example pilot, told her all.\nUp went the hushed amaze of hand and eye.\nBut when I dwelt upon your old affiance,\nShe answered sharply that I talked astray.\nI urged the fierce inscription on the gate,\nAnd our three lives. True--we had limed ourselves\nWith open eyes, and we must take the chance.\nBut such extremes, I told her, well might harm\nThe woman's cause. \"Not more than now,\" she said,\n\"So puddled as it is with favouritism.\"\nI tried the mother's heart. Shame might befall\nMelissa, knowing, saying not she knew:\nHer answer was \"Leave me to deal with that.\"\nI spoke of war to come and many deaths,\nAnd she replied, her duty was to speak,\nAnd duty duty, clear of consequences.\nI grew discouraged, Sir; but since I knew\nNo rock so hard but that a little wave\nMay beat admission in a thousand years,\nI recommenced; \"Decide not ere you pause.\nI find you here but in the second place,\nSome say the third--the authentic foundress you.\nI offer boldly: we will seat you highest:\nWink at our advent: help my prince to gain\nHis rightful bride, and here I promise you\nSome palace in our land, where you shall reign\nThe head and heart of all our fair she-world,\nAnd your great name flow on with broadening time\nFor ever.\" Well, she balanced this a little,\nAnd told me she would answer us today,\nmeantime be mute: thus much, nor more I gained.'\n\nHe ceasing, came a message from the Head.\n'That afternoon the Princess rode to take\nThe dip of certain strata to the North.\nWould we go with her? we should find the land\nWorth seeing; and the river made a fall\nOut yonder:' then she pointed on to where\nA double hill ran up his furrowy forks\nBeyond the thick-leaved platans of the vale.\n\nAgreed to, this, the day fled on through all\nIts range of duties to the appointed hour.\nThen summoned to the porch we went. She stood\nAmong her maidens, higher by the head,\nHer back against a pillar, her foot on one\nOf those tame leopards. Kittenlike he rolled\nAnd pawed about her sandal. I drew near;\nI gazed. On a sudden my strange seizure came\nUpon me, the weird vision of our house:\nThe Princess Ida seemed a hollow show,\nHer gay-furred cats a painted fantasy,\nHer college and her maidens, empty masks,\nAnd I myself the shadow of a dream,\nFor all things were and were not. Yet I felt\nMy heart beat thick with passion and with awe;\nThen from my breast the involuntary sigh\nBrake, as she smote me with the light of eyes\nThat lent my knee desire to kneel, and shook\nMy pulses, till to horse we got, and so\nWent forth in long retinue following up\nThe river as it narrowed to the hills.\n\nI rode beside her and to me she said:\n'O friend, we trust that you esteemed us not\nToo harsh to your companion yestermorn;\nUnwillingly we spake.' 'No--not to her,'\nI answered, 'but to one of whom we spake\nYour Highness might have seemed the thing you say.'\n'Again?' she cried, 'are you ambassadresses\nFrom him to me? we give you, being strange,\nA license: speak, and let the topic die.'\n\nI stammered that I knew him--could have wished--\n'Our king expects--was there no precontract?\nThere is no truer-hearted--ah, you seem\nAll he prefigured, and he could not see\nThe bird of passage flying south but longed\nTo follow: surely, if your Highness keep\nYour purport, you will shock him even to death,\nOr baser courses, children of despair.'\n\n'Poor boy,' she said, 'can he not read--no books?\nQuoit, tennis, ball--no games? nor deals in that\nWhich men delight in, martial exercise?\nTo nurse a blind ideal like a girl,\nMethinks he seems no better than a girl;\nAs girls were once, as we ourself have been:\nWe had our dreams; perhaps he mixt with them:\nWe touch on our dead self, nor shun to do it,\nBeing other--since we learnt our meaning here,\nTo lift the woman's fallen divinity\nUpon an even pedestal with man.'\n\nShe paused, and added with a haughtier smile\n'And as to precontracts, we move, my friend,\nAt no man's beck, but know ourself and thee,\nO Vashti, noble Vashti! Summoned out\nShe kept her state, and left the drunken king\nTo brawl at Shushan underneath the palms.'\n\n'Alas your Highness breathes full East,' I said,\n'On that which leans to you. I know the Prince,\nI prize his truth: and then how vast a work\nTo assail this gray pre\u00ebminence of man!\nYou grant me license; might I use it? think;\nEre half be done perchance your life may fail;\nThen comes the feebler heiress of your plan,\nAnd takes and ruins all; and thus your pains\nMay only make that footprint upon sand\nWhich old-recurring waves of prejudice\nResmooth to nothing: might I dread that you,\nWith only Fame for spouse and your great deeds\nFor issue, yet may live in vain, and miss,\nMeanwhile, what every woman counts her due,\nLove, children, happiness?'\nAnd she exclaimed,\n'Peace, you young savage of the Northern wild!\nWhat! though your Prince's love were like a God's,\nHave we not made ourself the sacrifice?\nYou are bold indeed: we are not talked to thus:\nYet will we say for children, would they grew\nLike field-flowers everywhere! we like them well:\nBut children die; and let me tell you, girl,\nHowe'er you babble, great deeds cannot die;\nThey with the sun and moon renew their light\nFor ever, blessing those that look on them.\nChildren--that men may pluck them from our hearts,\nKill us with pity, break us with ourselves--\nO--children--there is nothing upon earth\nMore miserable than she that has a son\nAnd sees him err: nor would we work for fame;\nThough she perhaps might reap the applause of Great,\nWho earns the one POU STO whence after-hands\nMay move the world, though she herself effect\nBut little: wherefore up and act, nor shrink\nFor fear our solid aim be dissipated\nBy frail successors. Would, indeed, we had been,\nIn lieu of many mortal flies, a race\nOf giants living, each, a thousand years,\nThat we might see our own work out, and watch\nThe sandy footprint harden into stone.'\n\nI answered nothing, doubtful in myself\nIf that strange Poet-princess with her grand\nImaginations might at all be won.\nAnd she broke out interpreting my thoughts:\n\n'No doubt we seem a kind of monster to you;\nWe are used to that: for women, up till this\nCramped under worse than South-sea-isle taboo,\nDwarfs of the gyn\u00e6ceum, fail so far\nIn high desire, they know not, cannot guess\nHow much their welfare is a passion to us.\nIf we could give them surer, quicker proof--\nOh if our end were less achievable\nBy slow approaches, than by single act\nOf immolation, any phase of death,\nWe were as prompt to spring against the pikes,\nOr down the fiery gulf as talk of it,\nTo compass our dear sisters' liberties.'\n\nShe bowed as if to veil a noble tear;\nAnd up we came to where the river sloped\nTo plunge in cataract, shattering on black blocks\nA breadth of thunder. O'er it shook the woods,\nAnd danced the colour, and, below, stuck out\nThe bones of some vast bulk that lived and roared\nBefore man was. She gazed awhile and said,\n'As these rude bones to us, are we to her\nThat will be.' 'Dare we dream of that,' I asked,\n'Which wrought us, as the workman and his work,\nThat practice betters?' 'How,' she cried, 'you love\nThe metaphysics! read and earn our prize,\nA golden brooch: beneath an emerald plane\nSits Diotima, teaching him that died\nOf hemlock; our device; wrought to the life;\nShe rapt upon her subject, he on her:\nFor there are schools for all.' 'And yet' I said\n'Methinks I have not found among them all\nOne anatomic.' 'Nay, we thought of that,'\nShe answered, 'but it pleased us not: in truth\nWe shudder but to dream our maids should ape\nThose monstrous males that carve the living hound,\nAnd cram him with the fragments of the grave,\nOr in the dark dissolving human heart,\nAnd holy secrets of this microcosm,\nDabbling a shameless hand with shameful jest,\nEncarnalize their spirits: yet we know\nKnowledge is knowledge, and this matter hangs:\nHowbeit ourself, foreseeing casualty,\nNor willing men should come among us, learnt,\nFor many weary moons before we came,\nThis craft of healing. Were you sick, ourself\nWould tend upon you. To your question now,\nWhich touches on the workman and his work.\nLet there be light and there was light: 'tis so:\nFor was, and is, and will be, are but is;\nAnd all creation is one act at once,\nThe birth of light: but we that are not all,\nAs parts, can see but parts, now this, now that,\nAnd live, perforce, from thought to thought, and make\nOne act a phantom of succession: thus\nOur weakness somehow shapes the shadow, Time;\nBut in the shadow will we work, and mould\nThe woman to the fuller day.'\nShe spake\nWith kindled eyes; we rode a league beyond,\nAnd, o'er a bridge of pinewood crossing, came\nOn flowery levels underneath the crag,\nFull of all beauty. 'O how sweet' I said\n(For I was half-oblivious of my mask)\n'To linger here with one that loved us.' 'Yea,'\nShe answered, 'or with fair philosophies\nThat lift the fancy; for indeed these fields\nAre lovely, lovelier not the Elysian lawns,\nWhere paced the Demigods of old, and saw\nThe soft white vapour streak the crown\u00e8d towers\nBuilt to the Sun:' then, turning to her maids,\n'Pitch our pavilion here upon the sward;\nLay out the viands.' At the word, they raised\nA tent of satin, elaborately wrought\nWith fair Corinna's triumph; here she stood,\nEngirt with many a florid maiden-cheek,\nThe woman-conqueror; woman-conquered there\nThe bearded Victor of ten-thousand hymns,\nAnd all the men mourned at his side: but we\nSet forth to climb; then, climbing, Cyril kept\nWith Psyche, with Melissa Florian, I\nWith mine affianced. Many a little hand\nGlanced like a touch of sunshine on the rocks,\nMany a light foot shone like a jewel set\nIn the dark crag: and then we turned, we wound\nAbout the cliffs, the copses, out and in,\nHammering and clinking, chattering stony names\nOf shales and hornblende, rag and trap and tuff,\nAmygdaloid and trachyte, till the Sun\nGrew broader toward his death and fell, and all\nThe rosy heights came out above the lawns.\n\nThe splendour falls on castle walls\nAnd snowy summits old in story:\nThe long light shakes across the lakes,\nAnd the wild cataract leaps in glory.\nBlow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\nBlow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\n\nO hark, O hear! how thin and clear,\nAnd thinner, clearer, farther going!\nO sweet and far from cliff and scar\nThe horns of Elfland faintly blowing!\nBlow, let us hear the purple glens replying:\nBlow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\n\nO love, they die in yon rich sky,\nThey faint on hill or field or river:\nOur echoes roll from soul to soul,\nAnd grow for ever and for ever.\nBlow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\nAnd answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.\n\nIV\n\n'There sinks the nebulous star we call the Sun,\nIf that hypothesis of theirs be sound'\nSaid Ida; 'let us down and rest;' and we\nDown from the lean and wrinkled precipices,\nBy every coppice-feathered chasm and cleft,\nDropt through the ambrosial gloom to where below\nNo bigger than a glow-worm shone the tent\nLamp-lit from the inner. Once she leaned on me,\nDescending; once or twice she lent her hand,\nAnd blissful palpitations in the blood,\nStirring a sudden transport rose and fell.\n\nBut when we planted level feet, and dipt\nBeneath the satin dome and entered in,\nThere leaning deep in broidered down we sank\nOur elbows: on a tripod in the midst\nA fragrant flame rose, and before us glowed\nFruit, blossom, viand, amber wine, and gold.\n\nThen she, 'Let some one sing to us: lightlier move\nThe minutes fledged with music:' and a maid,\nOf those beside her, smote her harp, and sang.\n\n'Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\nTears from the depth of some divine despair\nRise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\nIn looking on the happy Autumn-fields,\nAnd thinking of the days that are no more.\n\n'Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\nThat brings our friends up from the underworld,\nSad as the last which reddens over one\nThat sinks with all we love below the verge;\nSo sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\n\n'Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\nThe earliest pipe of half-awakened birds\nTo dying ears, when unto dying eyes\nThe casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\nSo sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\n\n'Dear as remembered kisses after death,\nAnd sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned\nOn lips that are for others; deep as love,\nDeep as first love, and wild with all regret;\nO Death in Life, the days that are no more.'\n\nShe ended with such passion that the tear,\nShe sang of, shook and fell, an erring pearl\nLost in her bosom: but with some disdain\nAnswered the Princess, 'If indeed there haunt\nAbout the mouldered lodges of the Past\nSo sweet a voice and vague, fatal to men,\nWell needs it we should cram our ears with wool\nAnd so pace by: but thine are fancies hatched\nIn silken-folded idleness; nor is it\nWiser to weep a true occasion lost,\nBut trim our sails, and let old bygones be,\nWhile down the streams that float us each and all\nTo the issue, goes, like glittering bergs of ice,\nThrone after throne, and molten on the waste\nBecomes a cloud: for all things serve their time\nToward that great year of equal mights and rights,\nNor would I fight with iron laws, in the end\nFound golden: let the past be past; let be\nTheir cancelled Babels: though the rough kex break\nThe starred mosaic, and the beard-blown goat\nHang on the shaft, and the wild figtree split\nTheir monstrous idols, care not while we hear\nA trumpet in the distance pealing news\nOf better, and Hope, a poising eagle, burns\nAbove the unrisen morrow:' then to me;\n'Know you no song of your own land,' she said,\n'Not such as moans about the retrospect,\nBut deals with the other distance and the hues\nOf promise; not a death's-head at the wine.'\n\nThen I remembered one myself had made,\nWhat time I watched the swallow winging south\nFrom mine own land, part made long since, and part\nNow while I sang, and maidenlike as far\nAs I could ape their treble, did I sing.\n\n'O Swallow, Swallow, flying, flying South,\nFly to her, and fall upon her gilded eaves,\nAnd tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee.\n\n'O tell her, Swallow, thou that knowest each,\nThat bright and fierce and fickle is the South,\nAnd dark and true and tender is the North.\n\n'O Swallow, Swallow, if I could follow, and light\nUpon her lattice, I would pipe and trill,\nAnd cheep and twitter twenty million loves.\n\n'O were I thou that she might take me in,\nAnd lay me on her bosom, and her heart\nWould rock the snowy cradle till I died.\n\n'Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,\nDelaying as the tender ash delays\nTo clothe herself, when all the woods are green?\n\n'O tell her, Swallow, that thy brood is flown:\nSay to her, I do but wanton in the South,\nBut in the North long since my nest is made.\n\n'O tell her, brief is life but love is long,\nAnd brief the sun of summer in the North,\nAnd brief the moon of beauty in the South.\n\n'O Swallow, flying from the golden woods,\nFly to her, and pipe and woo her, and make her mine,\nAnd tell her, tell her, that I follow thee.'\n\nI ceased, and all the ladies, each at each,\nLike the Ithacensian suitors in old time,\nStared with great eyes, and laughed with alien lips,\nAnd knew not what they meant; for still my voice\nRang false: but smiling 'Not for thee,' she said,\nO Bulbul, any rose of Gulistan\nShall burst her veil: marsh-divers, rather, maid,\nShall croak thee sister, or the meadow-crake\nGrate her harsh kindred in the grass: and this\nA mere love-poem! O for such, my friend,\nWe hold them slight: they mind us of the time\nWhen we made bricks in Egypt. Knaves are men,\nThat lute and flute fantastic tenderness,\nAnd dress the victim to the offering up,\nAnd paint the gates of Hell with Paradise,\nAnd play the slave to gain the tyranny.\nPoor soul! I had a maid of honour once;\nShe wept her true eyes blind for such a one,\nA rogue of canzonets and serenades.\nI loved her. Peace be with her. She is dead.\nSo they blaspheme the muse! But great is song\nUsed to great ends: ourself have often tried\nValkyrian hymns, or into rhythm have dashed\nThe passion of the prophetess; for song\nIs duer unto freedom, force and growth\nOf spirit than to junketing and love.\nLove is it? Would this same mock-love, and this\nMock-Hymen were laid up like winter bats,\nTill all men grew to rate us at our worth,\nNot vassals to be beat, nor pretty babes\nTo be dandled, no, but living wills, and sphered\nWhole in ourselves and owed to none. Enough!\nBut now to leaven play with profit, you,\nKnow you no song, the true growth of your soil,\nThat gives the manners of your country-women?'\n\nShe spoke and turned her sumptuous head with eyes\nOf shining expectation fixt on mine.\nThen while I dragged my brains for such a song,\nCyril, with whom the bell-mouthed glass had wrought,\nOr mastered by the sense of sport, began\nTo troll a careless, careless tavern-catch\nOf Moll and Meg, and strange experiences\nUnmeet for ladies. Florian nodded at him,\nI frowning; Psyche flushed and wanned and shook;\nThe lilylike Melissa drooped her brows;\n'Forbear,' the Princess cried; 'Forbear, Sir' I;\nAnd heated through and through with wrath and love,\nI smote him on the breast; he started up;\nThere rose a shriek as of a city sacked;\nMelissa clamoured 'Flee the death;' 'To horse'\nSaid Ida; 'home! to horse!' and fled, as flies\nA troop of snowy doves athwart the dusk,\nWhen some one batters at the dovecote-doors,\nDisorderly the women. Alone I stood\nWith Florian, cursing Cyril, vext at heart,\nIn the pavilion: there like parting hopes\nI heard them passing from me: hoof by hoof,\nAnd every hoof a knell to my desires,\nClanged on the bridge; and then another shriek,\n'The Head, the Head, the Princess, O the Head!'\nFor blind with rage she missed the plank, and rolled\nIn the river. Out I sprang from glow to gloom:\nThere whirled her white robe like a blossomed branch\nRapt to the horrible fall: a glance I gave,\nNo more; but woman-vested as I was\nPlunged; and the flood drew; yet I caught her; then\nOaring one arm, and bearing in my left\nThe weight of all the hopes of half the world,\nStrove to buffet to land in vain. A tree\nWas half-disrooted from his place and stooped\nTo wrench his dark locks in the gurgling wave\nMid-channel. Right on this we drove and caught,\nAnd grasping down the boughs I gained the shore.\n\nThere stood her maidens glimmeringly grouped\nIn the hollow bank. One reaching forward drew\nMy burthen from mine arms; they cried 'she lives:'\nThey bore her back into the tent: but I,\nSo much a kind of shame within me wrought,\nNot yet endured to meet her opening eyes,\nNor found my friends; but pushed alone on foot\n(For since her horse was lost I left her mine)\nAcross the woods, and less from Indian craft\nThan beelike instinct hiveward, found at length\nThe garden portals. Two great statues, Art\nAnd Science, Caryatids, lifted up\nA weight of emblem, and betwixt were valves\nOf open-work in which the hunter rued\nHis rash intrusion, manlike, but his brows\nHad sprouted, and the branches thereupon\nSpread out at top, and grimly spiked the gates.\n\nA little space was left between the horns,\nThrough which I clambered o'er at top with pain,\nDropt on the sward, and up the linden walks,\nAnd, tost on thoughts that changed from hue to hue,\nNow poring on the glowworm, now the star,\nI paced the terrace, till the Bear had wheeled\nThrough a great arc his seven slow suns.\nA step\nOf lightest echo, then a loftier form\nThan female, moving through the uncertain gloom,\nDisturbed me with the doubt 'if this were she,'\nBut it was Florian. 'Hist O Hist,' he said,\n'They seek us: out so late is out of rules.\nMoreover \"seize the strangers\" is the cry.\nHow came you here?' I told him: 'I' said he,\n'Last of the train, a moral leper, I,\nTo whom none spake, half-sick at heart, returned.\nArriving all confused among the rest\nWith hooded brows I crept into the hall,\nAnd, couched behind a Judith, underneath\nThe head of Holofernes peeped and saw.\nGirl after girl was called to trial: each\nDisclaimed all knowledge of us: last of all,\nMelissa: trust me, Sir, I pitied her.\nShe, questioned if she knew us men, at first\nWas silent; closer prest, denied it not:\nAnd then, demanded if her mother knew,\nOr Psyche, she affirmed not, or denied:\nFrom whence the Royal mind, familiar with her,\nEasily gathered either guilt. She sent\nFor Psyche, but she was not there; she called\nFor Psyche's child to cast it from the doors;\nShe sent for Blanche to accuse her face to face;\nAnd I slipt out: but whither will you now?\nAnd where are Psyche, Cyril? both are fled:\nWhat, if together? that were not so well.\nWould rather we had never come! I dread\nHis wildness, and the chances of the dark.'\n\n'And yet,' I said, 'you wrong him more than I\nThat struck him: this is proper to the clown,\nThough smocked, or furred and purpled, still the clown,\nTo harm the thing that trusts him, and to shame\nThat which he says he loves: for Cyril, howe'er\nHe deal in frolic, as tonight--the song\nMight have been worse and sinned in grosser lips\nBeyond all pardon--as it is, I hold\nThese flashes on the surface are not he.\nHe has a solid base of temperament:\nBut as the waterlily starts and slides\nUpon the level in little puffs of wind,\nThough anchored to the bottom, such is he.'\n\nScarce had I ceased when from a tamarisk near\nTwo Proctors leapt upon us, crying, 'Names:'\nHe, standing still, was clutched; but I began\nTo thrid the musky-circled mazes, wind\nAnd double in and out the boles, and race\nBy all the fountains: fleet I was of foot:\nBefore me showered the rose in flakes; behind\nI heard the puffed pursuer; at mine ear\nBubbled the nightingale and heeded not,\nAnd secret laughter tickled all my soul.\nAt last I hooked my ankle in a vine,\nThat claspt the feet of a Mnemosyne,\nAnd falling on my face was caught and known.\n\nThey haled us to the Princess where she sat\nHigh in the hall: above her drooped a lamp,\nAnd made the single jewel on her brow\nBurn like the mystic fire on a mast-head,\nProphet of storm: a handmaid on each side\nBowed toward her, combing out her long black hair\nDamp from the river; and close behind her stood\nEight daughters of the plough, stronger than men,\nHuge women blowzed with health, and wind, and rain,\nAnd labour. Each was like a Druid rock;\nOr like a spire of land that stands apart\nCleft from the main, and wailed about with mews.\n\nThen, as we came, the crowd dividing clove\nAn advent to the throne: and therebeside,\nHalf-naked as if caught at once from bed\nAnd tumbled on the purple footcloth, lay\nThe lily-shining child; and on the left,\nBowed on her palms and folded up from wrong,\nHer round white shoulder shaken with her sobs,\nMelissa knelt; but Lady Blanche erect\nStood up and spake, an affluent orator.\n\n'It was not thus, O Princess, in old days:\nYou prized my counsel, lived upon my lips:\nI led you then to all the Castalies;\nI fed you with the milk of every Muse;\nI loved you like this kneeler, and you me\nYour second mother: those were gracious times.\nThen came your new friend: you began to change--\nI saw it and grieved--to slacken and to cool;\nTill taken with her seeming openness\nYou turned your warmer currents all to her,\nTo me you froze: this was my meed for all.\nYet I bore up in part from ancient love,\nAnd partly that I hoped to win you back,\nAnd partly conscious of my own deserts,\nAnd partly that you were my civil head,\nAnd chiefly you were born for something great,\nIn which I might your fellow-worker be,\nWhen time should serve; and thus a noble scheme\nGrew up from seed we two long since had sown;\nIn us true growth, in her a Jonah's gourd,\nUp in one night and due to sudden sun:\nWe took this palace; but even from the first\nYou stood in your own light and darkened mine.\nWhat student came but that you planed her path\nTo Lady Psyche, younger, not so wise,\nA foreigner, and I your countrywoman,\nI your old friend and tried, she new in all?\nBut still her lists were swelled and mine were lean;\nYet I bore up in hope she would be known:\nThen came these wolves: ~they~ knew her: ~they~ endured,\nLong-closeted with her the yestermorn,\nTo tell her what they were, and she to hear:\nAnd me none told: not less to an eye like mine\nA lidless watcher of the public weal,\nLast night, their mask was patent, and my foot\nWas to you: but I thought again: I feared\nTo meet a cold \"We thank you, we shall hear of it\nFrom Lady Psyche:\" you had gone to her,\nShe told, perforce; and winning easy grace\nNo doubt, for slight delay, remained among us\nIn our young nursery still unknown, the stem\nLess grain than touchwood, while my honest heat\nWere all miscounted as malignant haste\nTo push my rival out of place and power.\nBut public use required she should be known;\nAnd since my oath was ta'en for public use,\nI broke the letter of it to keep the sense.\nI spoke not then at first, but watched them well,\nSaw that they kept apart, no mischief done;\nAnd yet this day (though you should hate me for it)\nI came to tell you; found that you had gone,\nRidden to the hills, she likewise: now, I thought,\nThat surely she will speak; if not, then I:\nDid she? These monsters blazoned what they were,\nAccording to the coarseness of their kind,\nFor thus I hear; and known at last (my work)\nAnd full of cowardice and guilty shame,\nI grant in her some sense of shame, she flies;\nAnd I remain on whom to wreak your rage,\nI, that have lent my life to build up yours,\nI that have wasted here health, wealth, and time,\nAnd talent, I--you know it--I will not boast:\nDismiss me, and I prophesy your plan,\nDivorced from my experience, will be chaff\nFor every gust of chance, and men will say\nWe did not know the real light, but chased\nThe wisp that flickers where no foot can tread.'\n\nShe ceased: the Princess answered coldly, 'Good:\nYour oath is broken: we dismiss you: go.\nFor this lost lamb (she pointed to the child)\nOur mind is changed: we take it to ourself.'\n\nThereat the Lady stretched a vulture throat,\nAnd shot from crooked lips a haggard smile.\n'The plan was mine. I built the nest' she said\n'To hatch the cuckoo. Rise!' and stooped to updrag\nMelissa: she, half on her mother propt,\nHalf-drooping from her, turned her face, and cast\nA liquid look on Ida, full of prayer,\nWhich melted Florian's fancy as she hung,\nA Niob\u00eban daughter, one arm out,\nAppealing to the bolts of Heaven; and while\nWe gazed upon her came a little stir\nAbout the doors, and on a sudden rushed\nAmong us, out of breath as one pursued,\nA woman-post in flying raiment. Fear\nStared in her eyes, and chalked her face, and winged\nHer transit to the throne, whereby she fell\nDelivering sealed dispatches which the Head\nTook half-amazed, and in her lion's mood\nTore open, silent we with blind surmise\nRegarding, while she read, till over brow\nAnd cheek and bosom brake the wrathful bloom\nAs of some fire against a stormy cloud,\nWhen the wild peasant rights himself, the rick\nFlames, and his anger reddens in the heavens;\nFor anger most it seemed, while now her breast,\nBeaten with some great passion at her heart,\nPalpitated, her hand shook, and we heard\nIn the dead hush the papers that she held\nRustle: at once the lost lamb at her feet\nSent out a bitter bleating for its dam;\nThe plaintive cry jarred on her ire; she crushed\nThe scrolls together, made a sudden turn\nAs if to speak, but, utterance failing her,\nShe whirled them on to me, as who should say\n'Read,' and I read--two letters--one her sire's.\n\n'Fair daughter, when we sent the Prince your way,\nWe knew not your ungracious laws, which learnt,\nWe, conscious of what temper you are built,\nCame all in haste to hinder wrong, but fell\nInto his father's hands, who has this night,\nYou lying close upon his territory,\nSlipt round and in the dark invested you,\nAnd here he keeps me hostage for his son.'\n\nThe second was my father's running thus:\n'You have our son: touch not a hair of his head:\nRender him up unscathed: give him your hand:\nCleave to your contract: though indeed we hear\nYou hold the woman is the better man;\nA rampant heresy, such as if it spread\nWould make all women kick against their Lords\nThrough all the world, and which might well deserve\nThat we this night should pluck your palace down;\nAnd we will do it, unless you send us back\nOur son, on the instant, whole.'\nSo far I read;\nAnd then stood up and spoke impetuously.\n\n'O not to pry and peer on your reserve,\nBut led by golden wishes, and a hope\nThe child of regal compact, did I break\nYour precinct; not a scorner of your sex\nBut venerator, zealous it should be\nAll that it might be: hear me, for I bear,\nThough man, yet human, whatsoe'er your wrongs,\nFrom the flaxen curl to the gray lock a life\nLess mine than yours: my nurse would tell me of you;\nI babbled for you, as babies for the moon,\nVague brightness; when a boy, you stooped to me\nFrom all high places, lived in all fair lights,\nCame in long breezes rapt from inmost south\nAnd blown to inmost north; at eve and dawn\nWith Ida, Ida, Ida, rang the woods;\nThe leader wildswan in among the stars\nWould clang it, and lapt in wreaths of glowworm light\nThe mellow breaker murmured Ida. Now,\nBecause I would have reached you, had you been\nSphered up with Cassiop\u00ebia, or the enthroned\nPersephon\u00e8 in Hades, now at length,\nThose winters of abeyance all worn out,\nA man I came to see you: but indeed,\nNot in this frequence can I lend full tongue,\nO noble Ida, to those thoughts that wait\nOn you, their centre: let me say but this,\nThat many a famous man and woman, town\nAnd landskip, have I heard of, after seen\nThe dwarfs of presage: though when known, there grew\nAnother kind of beauty in detail\nMade them worth knowing; but in your I found\nMy boyish dream involved and dazzled down\nAnd mastered, while that after-beauty makes\nSuch head from act to act, from hour to hour,\nWithin me, that except you slay me here,\nAccording to your bitter statute-book,\nI cannot cease to follow you, as they say\nThe seal does music; who desire you more\nThan growing boys their manhood; dying lips,\nWith many thousand matters left to do,\nThe breath of life; O more than poor men wealth,\nThan sick men health--yours, yours, not mine--but half\nWithout you; with you, whole; and of those halves\nYou worthiest; and howe'er you block and bar\nYour heart with system out from mine, I hold\nThat it becomes no man to nurse despair,\nBut in the teeth of clenched antagonisms\nTo follow up the worthiest till he die:\nYet that I came not all unauthorized\nBehold your father's letter.'\nOn one knee\nKneeling, I gave it, which she caught, and dashed\nUnopened at her feet: a tide of fierce\nInvective seemed to wait behind her lips,\nAs waits a river level with the dam\nReady to burst and flood the world with foam:\nAnd so she would have spoken, but there rose\nA hubbub in the court of half the maids\nGathered together: from the illumined hall\nLong lanes of splendour slanted o'er a press\nOf snowy shoulders, thick as herded ewes,\nAnd rainbow robes, and gems and gemlike eyes,\nAnd gold and golden heads; they to and fro\nFluctuated, as flowers in storm, some red, some pale,\nAll open-mouthed, all gazing to the light,\nSome crying there was an army in the land,\nAnd some that men were in the very walls,\nAnd some they cared not; till a clamour grew\nAs of a new-world Babel, woman-built,\nAnd worse-confounded: high above them stood\nThe placid marble Muses, looking peace.\n\nNot peace she looked, the Head: but rising up\nRobed in the long night of her deep hair, so\nTo the open window moved, remaining there\nFixt like a beacon-tower above the waves\nOf tempest, when the crimson-rolling eye\nGlares ruin, and the wild birds on the light\nDash themselves dead. She stretched her arms and called\nAcross the tumult and the tumult fell.\n\n'What fear ye, brawlers? am not I your Head?\nOn me, me, me, the storm first breaks: ~I~ dare\nAll these male thunderbolts: what is it ye fear?\nPeace! there are those to avenge us and they come:\nIf not,--myself were like enough, O girls,\nTo unfurl the maiden banner of our rights,\nAnd clad in iron burst the ranks of war,\nOr, falling, promartyr of our cause,\nDie: yet I blame you not so much for fear:\nSix thousand years of fear have made you that\nFrom which I would redeem you: but for those\nThat stir this hubbub--you and you--I know\nYour faces there in the crowd--tomorrow morn\nWe hold a great convention: then shall they\nThat love their voices more than duty, learn\nWith whom they deal, dismissed in shame to live\nNo wiser than their mothers, household stuff,\nLive chattels, mincers of each other's fame,\nFull of weak poison, turnspits for the clown,\nThe drunkard's football, laughing-stocks of Time,\nWhose brains are in their hands and in their heels\nBut fit to flaunt, to dress, to dance, to thrum,\nTo tramp, to scream, to burnish, and to scour,\nFor ever slaves at home and fools abroad.'\n\nShe, ending, waved her hands: thereat the crowd\nMuttering, dissolved: then with a smile, that looked\nA stroke of cruel sunshine on the cliff,\nWhen all the glens are drowned in azure gloom\nOf thunder-shower, she floated to us and said:\n\n'You have done well and like a gentleman,\nAnd like a prince: you have our thanks for all:\nAnd you look well too in your woman's dress:\nWell have you done and like a gentleman.\nYou saved our life: we owe you bitter thanks:\nBetter have died and spilt our bones in the flood--\nThen men had said--but now--What hinders me\nTo take such bloody vengeance on you both?--\nYet since our father--Wasps in our good hive,\nYou would-be quenchers of the light to be,\nBarbarians, grosser than your native bears--\nO would I had his sceptre for one hour!\nYou that have dared to break our bound, and gulled\nOur servants, wronged and lied and thwarted us--\n~I~ wed with thee! ~I~ bound by precontract\nYour bride, our bondslave! not though all the gold\nThat veins the world were packed to make your crown,\nAnd every spoken tongue should lord you. Sir,\nYour falsehood and yourself are hateful to us:\nI trample on your offers and on you:\nBegone: we will not look upon you more.\nHere, push them out at gates.'\nIn wrath she spake.\nThen those eight mighty daughters of the plough\nBent their broad faces toward us and addressed\nTheir motion: twice I sought to plead my cause,\nBut on my shoulder hung their heavy hands,\nThe weight of destiny: so from her face\nThey pushed us, down the steps, and through the court,\nAnd with grim laughter thrust us out at gates.\n\nWe crossed the street and gained a petty mound\nBeyond it, whence we saw the lights and heard the voices murmuring. While I listened, came\nOn a sudden the weird seizure and the doubt:\nI seemed to move among a world of ghosts;\nThe Princess with her monstrous woman-guard,\nThe jest and earnest working side by side,\nThe cataract and the tumult and the kings\nWere shadows; and the long fantastic night\nWith all its doings had and had not been,\nAnd all things were and were not.\nThis went by\nAs strangely as it came, and on my spirits\nSettled a gentle cloud of melancholy;\nNot long; I shook it off; for spite of doubts\nAnd sudden ghostly shadowings I was one\nTo whom the touch of all mischance but came\nAs night to him that sitting on a hill\nSees the midsummer, midnight, Norway sun\nSet into sunrise; then we moved away.\n\nThy voice is heard through rolling drums,\nThat beat to battle where he stands;\nThy face across his fancy comes,\nAnd gives the battle to his hands:\nA moment, while the trumpets blow,\nHe sees his brood about thy knee;\nThe next, like fire he meets the foe,\nAnd strikes him dead for thine and thee.\n\nSo Lilia sang: we thought her half-possessed,\nShe struck such warbling fury through the words;\nAnd, after, feigning pique at what she called\nThe raillery, or grotesque, or false sublime--\nLike one that wishes at a dance to change\nThe music--clapt her hands and cried for war,\nOr some grand fight to kill and make an end:\nAnd he that next inherited the tale\nHalf turning to the broken statue, said,\n'Sir Ralph has got your colours: if I prove\nYour knight, and fight your battle, what for me?'\nIt chanced, her empty glove upon the tomb\nLay by her like a model of her hand.\nShe took it and she flung it. 'Fight' she said,\n'And make us all we would be, great and good.'\nHe knightlike in his cap instead of casque,\nA cap of Tyrol borrowed from the hall,\nArranged the favour, and assumed the Prince.\n\nV\n\nNow, scarce three paces measured from the mound,\nWe stumbled on a stationary voice,\nAnd 'Stand, who goes?' 'Two from the palace' I.\n'The second two: they wait,' he said, 'pass on;\nHis Highness wakes:' and one, that clashed in arms,\nBy glimmering lanes and walls of canvas led\nThreading the soldier-city, till we heard\nThe drowsy folds of our great ensign shake\nFrom blazoned lions o'er the imperial tent\nWhispers of war.\nEntering, the sudden light\nDazed me half-blind: I stood and seemed to hear,\nAs in a poplar grove when a light wind wakes\nA lisping of the innumerous leaf and dies,\nEach hissing in his neighbour's ear; and then\nA strangled titter, out of which there brake\nOn all sides, clamouring etiquette to death,\nUnmeasured mirth; while now the two old kings\nBegan to wag their baldness up and down,\nThe fresh young captains flashed their glittering teeth,\nThe huge bush-bearded Barons heaved and blew,\nAnd slain with laughter rolled the gilded Squire.\n\nAt length my Sire, his rough cheek wet with tears,\nPanted from weary sides 'King, you are free!\nWe did but keep you surety for our son,\nIf this be he,--or a dragged mawkin, thou,\nThat tends to her bristled grunters in the sludge:'\nFor I was drenched with ooze, and torn with briers,\nMore crumpled than a poppy from the sheath,\nAnd all one rag, disprinced from head to heel.\nThen some one sent beneath his vaulted palm\nA whispered jest to some one near him, 'Look,\nHe has been among his shadows.' 'Satan take\nThe old women and their shadows! (thus the King\nRoared) make yourself a man to fight with men.\nGo: Cyril told us all.'\nAs boys that slink\nFrom ferule and the trespass-chiding eye,\nAway we stole, and transient in a trice\nFrom what was left of faded woman-slough\nTo sheathing splendours and the golden scale\nOf harness, issued in the sun, that now\nLeapt from the dewy shoulders of the Earth,\nAnd hit the Northern hills. Here Cyril met us.\nA little shy at first, but by and by\nWe twain, with mutual pardon asked and given\nFor stroke and song, resoldered peace, whereon\nFollowed his tale. Amazed he fled away\nThrough the dark land, and later in the night\nHad come on Psyche weeping: 'then we fell\nInto your father's hand, and there she lies,\nBut will not speak, or stir.'\nHe showed a tent\nA stone-shot off: we entered in, and there\nAmong piled arms and rough accoutrements,\nPitiful sight, wrapped in a soldier's cloak,\nLike some sweet sculpture draped from head to foot,\nAnd pushed by rude hands from its pedestal,\nAll her fair length upon the ground she lay:\nAnd at her head a follower of the camp,\nA charred and wrinkled piece of womanhood,\nSat watching like the watcher by the dead.\n\nThen Florian knelt, and 'Come' he whispered to her,\n'Lift up your head, sweet sister: lie not thus.\nWhat have you done but right? you could not slay\nMe, nor your prince: look up: be comforted:\nSweet is it to have done the thing one ought,\nWhen fallen in darker ways.' And likewise I:\n'Be comforted: have I not lost her too,\nIn whose least act abides the nameless charm\nThat none has else for me?' She heard, she moved,\nShe moaned, a folded voice; and up she sat,\nAnd raised the cloak from brows as pale and smooth\nAs those that mourn half-shrouded over death\nIn deathless marble. 'Her,' she said, 'my friend--\nParted from her--betrayed her cause and mine--\nWhere shall I breathe? why kept ye not your faith?\nO base and bad! what comfort? none for me!'\nTo whom remorseful Cyril, 'Yet I pray\nTake comfort: live, dear lady, for your child!'\nAt which she lifted up her voice and cried.\n\n'Ah me, my babe, my blossom, ah, my child,\nMy one sweet child, whom I shall see no more!\nFor now will cruel Ida keep her back;\nAnd either she will die from want of care,\nOr sicken with ill-usage, when they say\nThe child is hers--for every little fault,\nThe child is hers; and they will beat my girl\nRemembering her mother: O my flower!\nOr they will take her, they will make her hard,\nAnd she will pass me by in after-life\nWith some cold reverence worse than were she dead.\nIll mother that I was to leave her there,\nTo lag behind, scared by the cry they made,\nThe horror of the shame among them all:\nBut I will go and sit beside the doors,\nAnd make a wild petition night and day,\nUntil they hate to hear me like a wind\nWailing for ever, till they open to me,\nAnd lay my little blossom at my feet,\nMy babe, my sweet Agla\u00efa, my one child:\nAnd I will take her up and go my way,\nAnd satisfy my soul with kissing her:\nAh! what might that man not deserve of me\nWho gave me back my child?' 'Be comforted,'\nSaid Cyril, 'you shall have it:' but again\nShe veiled her brows, and prone she sank, and so\nLike tender things that being caught feign death,\nSpoke not, nor stirred.\nBy this a murmur ran\nThrough all the camp and inward raced the scouts\nWith rumour of Prince Arab hard at hand.\nWe left her by the woman, and without\nFound the gray kings at parle: and 'Look you' cried\nMy father 'that our compact be fulfilled:\nYou have spoilt this child; she laughs at you and man:\nShe wrongs herself, her sex, and me, and him:\nBut red-faced war has rods of steel and fire;\nShe yields, or war.'\nThen Gama turned to me:\n'We fear, indeed, you spent a stormy time\nWith our strange girl: and yet they say that still\nYou love her. Give us, then, your mind at large:\nHow say you, war or not?'\n'Not war, if possible,\nO king,' I said, 'lest from the abuse of war,\nThe desecrated shrine, the trampled year,\nThe smouldering homestead, and the household flower\nTorn from the lintel--all the common wrong--\nA smoke go up through which I loom to her\nThree times a monster: now she lightens scorn\nAt him that mars her plan, but then would hate\n(And every voice she talked with ratify it,\nAnd every face she looked on justify it)\nThe general foe. More soluble is this knot,\nBy gentleness than war. I want her love.\nWhat were I nigher this although we dashed\nYour cities into shards with catapults,\nShe would not love;--or brought her chained, a slave,\nThe lifting of whose eyelash is my lord,\nNot ever would she love; but brooding turn\nThe book of scorn, till all my flitting chance\nWere caught within the record of her wrongs,\nAnd crushed to death: and rather, Sire, than this\nI would the old God of war himself were dead,\nForgotten, rusting on his iron hills,\nRotting on some wild shore with ribs of wreck,\nOr like an old-world mammoth bulked in ice,\nNot to be molten out.'\nAnd roughly spake\nMy father, 'Tut, you know them not, the girls.\nBoy, when I hear you prate I almost think\nThat idiot legend credible. Look you, Sir!\nMan is the hunter; woman is his game:\nThe sleek and shining creatures of the chase,\nWe hunt them for the beauty of their skins;\nThey love us for it, and we ride them down.\nWheedling and siding with them! Out! for shame!\nBoy, there's no rose that's half so dear to them\nAs he that does the thing they dare not do,\nBreathing and sounding beauteous battle, comes\nWith the air of the trumpet round him, and leaps in\nAmong the women, snares them by the score\nFlattered and flustered, wins, though dashed with death\nHe reddens what he kisses: thus I won\nYou mother, a good mother, a good wife,\nWorth winning; but this firebrand--gentleness\nTo such as her! if Cyril spake her true,\nTo catch a dragon in a cherry net,\nTo trip a tigress with a gossamer\nWere wisdom to it.'\n'Yea but Sire,' I cried,\n'Wild natures need wise curbs. The soldier? No:\nWhat dares not Ida do that she should prize\nThe soldier? I beheld her, when she rose\nThe yesternight, and storming in extremes,\nStood for her cause, and flung defiance down\nGagelike to man, and had not shunned the death,\nNo, not the soldier's: yet I hold her, king,\nTrue woman: you clash them all in one,\nThat have as many differences as we.\nThe violet varies from the lily as far\nAs oak from elm: one loves the soldier, one\nThe silken priest of peace, one this, one that,\nAnd some unworthily; their sinless faith,\nA maiden moon that sparkles on a sty,\nGlorifying clown and satyr; whence they need\nMore breadth of culture: is not Ida right?\nThey worth it? truer to the law within?\nSeverer in the logic of a life?\nTwice as magnetic to sweet influences\nOf earth and heaven? and she of whom you speak,\nMy mother, looks as whole as some serene\nCreation minted in the golden moods\nOf sovereign artists; not a thought, a touch,\nBut pure as lines of green that streak the white\nOf the first snowdrop's inner leaves; I say,\nNot like the piebald miscellany, man,\nBursts of great heart and slips in sensual mire,\nBut whole and one: and take them all-in-all,\nWere we ourselves but half as good, as kind,\nAs truthful, much that Ida claims as right\nHad ne'er been mooted, but as frankly theirs\nAs dues of Nature. To our point: not war:\nLest I lose all.'\n'Nay, nay, you spake but sense'\nSaid Gama. 'We remember love ourself\nIn our sweet youth; we did not rate him then\nThis red-hot iron to be shaped with blows.\nYou talk almost like Ida: ~she~ can talk;\nAnd there is something in it as you say:\nBut you talk kindlier: we esteem you for it.--\nHe seems a gracious and a gallant Prince,\nI would he had our daughter: for the rest,\nOur own detention, why, the causes weighed,\nFatherly fears--you used us courteously--\nWe would do much to gratify your Prince--\nWe pardon it; and for your ingress here\nUpon the skirt and fringe of our fair land,\nyou did but come as goblins in the night,\nNor in the furrow broke the ploughman's head,\nNor burnt the grange, nor bussed the milking-maid,\nNor robbed the farmer of his bowl of cream:\nBut let your Prince (our royal word upon it,\nHe comes back safe) ride with us to our lines,\nAnd speak with Arac: Arac's word is thrice\nAs ours with Ida: something may be done--\nI know not what--and ours shall see us friends.\nYou, likewise, our late guests, if so you will,\nFollow us: who knows? we four may build some plan\nFoursquare to opposition.'\nHere he reached\nWhite hands of farewell to my sire, who growled\nAn answer which, half-muffled in his beard,\nLet so much out as gave us leave to go.\n\nThen rode we with the old king across the lawns\nBeneath huge trees, a thousand rings of Spring\nIn every bole, a song on every spray\nOf birds that piped their Valentines, and woke\nDesire in me to infuse my tale of love\nIn the old king's ears, who promised help, and oozed\nAll o'er with honeyed answer as we rode\nAnd blossom-fragrant slipt the heavy dews\nGathered by night and peace, with each light air\nOn our mailed heads: but other thoughts than Peace\nBurnt in us, when we saw the embattled squares,\nAnd squadrons of the Prince, trampling the flowers\nWith clamour: for among them rose a cry\nAs if to greet the king; they made a halt;\nThe horses yelled; they clashed their arms; the drum\nBeat; merrily-blowing shrilled the martial fife;\nAnd in the blast and bray of the long horn\nAnd serpent-throated bugle, undulated\nThe banner: anon to meet us lightly pranced\nThree captains out; nor ever had I seen\nSuch thews of men: the midmost and the highest\nWas Arac: all about his motion clung\nThe shadow of his sister, as the beam\nOf the East, that played upon them, made them glance\nLike those three stars of the airy Giant's zone,\nThat glitter burnished by the frosty dark;\nAnd as the fiery Sirius alters hue,\nAnd bickers into red and emerald, shone\nTheir morions, washed with morning, as they came.\n\nAnd I that prated peace, when first I heard\nWar-music, felt the blind wildbeast of force,\nWhose home is in the sinews of a man,\nStir in me as to strike: then took the king\nHis three broad sons; with now a wandering hand\nAnd now a pointed finger, told them all:\nA common light of smiles at our disguise\nBroke from their lips, and, ere the windy jest\nHad laboured down within his ample lungs,\nThe genial giant, Arac, rolled himself\nThrice in the saddle, then burst out in words.\n\n'Our land invaded, 'sdeath! and he himself\nYour captive, yet my father wills not war:\nAnd, 'sdeath! myself, what care I, war or no?\nbut then this question of your troth remains:\nAnd there's a downright honest meaning in her;\nShe flies too high, she flies too high! and yet\nShe asked but space and fairplay for her scheme;\nShe prest and prest it on me--I myself,\nWhat know I of these things? but, life and soul!\nI thought her half-right talking of her wrongs;\nI say she flies too high, 'sdeath! what of that?\nI take her for the flower of womankind,\nAnd so I often told her, right or wrong,\nAnd, Prince, she can be sweet to those she loves,\nAnd, right or wrong, I care not: this is all,\nI stand upon her side: she made me swear it--\n'Sdeath--and with solemn rites by candle-light--\nSwear by St something--I forget her name--\nHer that talked down the fifty wisest men;\n~She~ was a princess too; and so I swore.\nCome, this is all; she will not: waive your claim:\nIf not, the foughten field, what else, at once\nDecides it, 'sdeath! against my father's will.'\n\nI lagged in answer loth to render up\nMy precontract, and loth by brainless war\nTo cleave the rift of difference deeper yet;\nTill one of those two brothers, half aside\nAnd fingering at the hair about his lip,\nTo prick us on to combat 'Like to like!\nThe woman's garment hid the woman's heart.'\nA taunt that clenched his purpose like a blow!\nFor fiery-short was Cyril's counter-scoff,\nAnd sharp I answered, touched upon the point\nWhere idle boys are cowards to their shame,\n'Decide it here: why not? we are three to three.'\n\nThen spake the third 'But three to three? no more?\nNo more, and in our noble sister's cause?\nMore, more, for honour: every captain waits\nHungry for honour, angry for his king.\nMore, more some fifty on a side, that each\nMay breathe himself, and quick! by overthrow\nOf these or those, the question settled die.'\n\n'Yea,' answered I, 'for this wreath of air,\nThis flake of rainbow flying on the highest\nFoam of men's deeds--this honour, if ye will.\nIt needs must be for honour if at all:\nSince, what decision? if we fail, we fail,\nAnd if we win, we fail: she would not keep\nHer compact.' ''Sdeath! but we will send to her,'\nSaid Arac, 'worthy reasons why she should\nBide by this issue: let our missive through,\nAnd you shall have her answer by the word.'\n\n'Boys!' shrieked the old king, but vainlier than a hen\nTo her false daughters in the pool; for none\nRegarded; neither seemed there more to say:\nBack rode we to my father's camp, and found\nHe thrice had sent a herald to the gates,\nTo learn if Ida yet would cede our claim,\nOr by denial flush her babbling wells\nWith her own people's life: three times he went:\nThe first, he blew and blew, but none appeared:\nHe battered at the doors; none came: the next,\nAn awful voice within had warned him thence:\nThe third, and those eight daughters of the plough\nCame sallying through the gates, and caught his hair,\nAnd so belaboured him on rib and cheek\nThey made him wild: not less one glance he caught\nThrough open doors of Ida stationed there\nUnshaken, clinging to her purpose, firm\nThough compassed by two armies and the noise\nOf arms; and standing like a stately Pine\nSet in a cataract on an island-crag,\nWhen storm is on the heights, and right and left\nSucked from the dark heart of the long hills roll\nThe torrents, dashed to the vale: and yet her will\nBred will in me to overcome it or fall.\n\nBut when I told the king that I was pledged\nTo fight in tourney for my bride, he clashed\nHis iron palms together with a cry;\nHimself would tilt it out among the lads:\nBut overborne by all his bearded lords\nWith reasons drawn from age and state, perforce\nHe yielded, wroth and red, with fierce demur:\nAnd many a bold knight started up in heat,\nAnd sware to combat for my claim till death.\n\nAll on this side the palace ran the field\nFlat to the garden-wall: and likewise here,\nAbove the garden's glowing blossom-belts,\nA columned entry shone and marble stairs,\nAnd great bronze valves, embossed with Tomyris\nAnd what she did to Cyrus after fight,\nBut now fast barred: so here upon the flat\nAll that long morn the lists were hammered up,\nAnd all that morn the heralds to and fro,\nWith message and defiance, went and came;\nLast, Ida's answer, in a royal hand,\nBut shaken here and there, and rolling words\nOration-like. I kissed it and I read.\n\n'O brother, you have known the pangs we felt,\nWhat heats of indignation when we heard\nOf those that iron-cramped their women's feet;\nOf lands in which at the altar the poor bride\nGives her harsh groom for bridal-gift a scourge;\nOf living hearts that crack within the fire\nWhere smoulder their dead despots; and of those,--\nMothers,--that, with all prophetic pity, fling\nTheir pretty maids in the running flood, and swoops\nThe vulture, beak and talon, at the heart\nMade for all noble motion: and I saw\nThat equal baseness lived in sleeker times\nWith smoother men: the old leaven leavened all:\nMillions of throats would bawl for civil rights,\nNo woman named: therefore I set my face\nAgainst all men, and lived but for mine own.\nFar off from men I built a fold for them:\nI stored it full of rich memorial:\nI fenced it round with gallant institutes,\nAnd biting laws to scare the beasts of prey\nAnd prospered; till a rout of saucy boys\nBrake on us at our books, and marred our peace,\nMasked like our maids, blustering I know not what\nOf insolence and love, some pretext held\nOf baby troth, invalid, since my will\nSealed not the bond--the striplings! for their sport!--\nI tamed my leopards: shall I not tame these?\nOr you? or I? for since you think me touched\nIn honour--what, I would not aught of false--\nIs not our case pure? and whereas I know\nYour prowess, Arac, and what mother's blood\nYou draw from, fight; you failing, I abide\nWhat end soever: fail you will not. Still\nTake not his life: he risked it for my own;\nHis mother lives: yet whatsoe'er you do,\nFight and fight well; strike and strike him. O dear\nBrothers, the woman's Angel guards you, you\nThe sole men to be mingled with our cause,\nThe sole men we shall prize in the after-time,\nYour very armour hallowed, and your statues\nReared, sung to, when, this gad-fly brushed aside,\nWe plant a solid foot into the Time,\nAnd mould a generation strong to move\nWith claim on claim from right to right, till she\nWhose name is yoked with children's, know herself;\nAnd Knowledge in our own land make her free,\nAnd, ever following those two crown\u00e8d twins,\nCommerce and conquest, shower the fiery grain\nOf freedom broadcast over all the orbs\nBetween the Northern and the Southern morn.'\n\nThen came a postscript dashed across the rest.\nSee that there be no traitors in your camp:\nWe seem a nest of traitors--none to trust\nSince our arms failed--this Egypt-plague of men!\nAlmost our maids were better at their homes,\nThan thus man-girdled here: indeed I think\nOur chiefest comfort is the little child\nOf one unworthy mother; which she left:\nShe shall not have it back: the child shall grow\nTo prize the authentic mother of her mind.\nI took it for an hour in mine own bed\nThis morning: there the tender orphan hands\nFelt at my heart, and seemed to charm from thence\nThe wrath I nursed against the world: farewell.'\n\nI ceased; he said, 'Stubborn, but she may sit\nUpon a king's right hand in thunder-storms,\nAnd breed up warriors! See now, though yourself\nBe dazzled by the wildfire Love to sloughs\nThat swallow common sense, the spindling king,\nThis Gama swamped in lazy tolerance.\nWhen the man wants weight, the woman takes it up,\nAnd topples down the scales; but this is fixt\nAs are the roots of earth and base of all;\nMan for the field and woman for the hearth:\nMan for the sword and for the needle she:\nMan with the head and woman with the heart:\nMan to command and woman to obey;\nAll else confusion. Look you! the gray mare\nIs ill to live with, when her whinny shrills\nFrom tile to scullery, and her small goodman\nShrinks in his arm-chair while the fires of Hell\nMix with his hearth: but you--she's yet a colt--\nTake, break her: strongly groomed and straitly curbed\nShe might not rank with those detestable\nThat let the bantling scald at home, and brawl\nTheir rights and wrongs like potherbs in the street.\nThey say she's comely; there's the fairer chance:\n~I~ like her none the less for rating at her!\nBesides, the woman wed is not as we,\nBut suffers change of frame. A lusty brace\nOf twins may weed her of her folly. Boy,\nThe bearing and the training of a child\nIs woman's wisdom.'\nThus the hard old king:\nI took my leave, for it was nearly noon:\nI pored upon her letter which I held,\nAnd on the little clause 'take not his life:'\nI mused on that wild morning in the woods,\nAnd on the 'Follow, follow, thou shalt win:'\nI thought on all the wrathful king had said,\nAnd how the strange betrothment was to end:\nThen I remembered that burnt sorcerer's curse\nThat one should fight with shadows and should fall;\nAnd like a flash the weird affection came:\nKing, camp and college turned to hollow shows;\nI seemed to move in old memorial tilts,\nAnd doing battle with forgotten ghosts,\nTo dream myself the shadow of a dream:\nAnd ere I woke it was the point of noon,\nThe lists were ready. Empanoplied and plumed\nWe entered in, and waited, fifty there\nOpposed to fifty, till the trumpet blared\nAt the barrier like a wild horn in a land\nOf echoes, and a moment, and once more\nThe trumpet, and again: at which the storm\nOf galloping hoofs bare on the ridge of spears\nAnd riders front to front, until they closed\nIn conflict with the crash of shivering points,\nAnd thunder. Yet it seemed a dream, I dreamed\nOf fighting. On his haunches rose the steed,\nAnd into fiery splinters leapt the lance,\nAnd out of stricken helmets sprang the fire.\nPart sat like rocks: part reeled but kept their seats:\nPart rolled on the earth and rose again and drew:\nPart stumbled mixt with floundering horses. Down\nFrom those two bulks at Arac's side, and down\nFrom Arac's arm, as from a giant's flail,\nThe large blows rained, as here and everywhere\nHe rode the mellay, lord of the ringing lists,\nAnd all the plain,--brand, mace, and shaft, and shield--\nShocked, like an iron-clanging anvil banged\nWith hammers; till I thought, can this be he\nFrom Gama's dwarfish loins? if this be so,\nThe mother makes us most--and in my dream\nI glanced aside, and saw the palace-front\nAlive with fluttering scarfs and ladies' eyes,\nAnd highest, among the statues, statuelike,\nBetween a cymballed Miriam and a Jael,\nWith Psyche's babe, was Ida watching us,\nA single band of gold about her hair,\nLike a Saint's glory up in heaven: but she\nNo saint--inexorable--no tenderness--\nToo hard, too cruel: yet she sees me fight,\nYea, let her see me fall! and with that I drave\nAmong the thickest and bore down a Prince,\nAnd Cyril, one. Yea, let me make my dream\nAll that I would. But that large-moulded man,\nHis visage all agrin as at a wake,\nMade at me through the press, and, staggering back\nWith stroke on stroke the horse and horseman, came\nAs comes a pillar of electric cloud,\nFlaying the roofs and sucking up the drains,\nAnd shadowing down the champaign till it strikes\nOn a wood, and takes, and breaks, and cracks, and splits,\nAnd twists the grain with such a roar that Earth\nReels, and the herdsmen cry; for everything\nGame way before him: only Florian, he\nThat loved me closer than his own right eye,\nThrust in between; but Arac rode him down:\nAnd Cyril seeing it, pushed against the Prince,\nWith Psyche's colour round his helmet, tough,\nStrong, supple, sinew-corded, apt at arms;\nBut tougher, heavier, stronger, he that smote\nAnd threw him: last I spurred; I felt my veins\nStretch with fierce heat; a moment hand to hand,\nAnd sword to sword, and horse to horse we hung,\nTill I struck out and shouted; the blade glanced,\nI did but shear a feather, and dream and truth\nFlowed from me; darkness closed me; and I fell.\n\nHome they brought her warrior dead:\nShe nor swooned, nor uttered cry:\nAll her maidens, watching, said,\n'She must weep or she will die.'\n\nThen they praised him, soft and low,\nCalled him worthy to be loved,\nTruest friend and noblest foe;\nYet she neither spoke nor moved.\n\nStole a maiden from her place,\nLightly to the warrior stept,\nTook the face-cloth from the face;\nYet she neither moved nor wept.\n\nRose a nurse of ninety years,\nSet his child upon her knee--\nLike summer tempest came her tears--\n'Sweet my child, I live for thee.'\n\nVI\n\nMy dream had never died or lived again.\nAs in some mystic middle state I lay;\nSeeing I saw not, hearing not I heard:\nThough, if I saw not, yet they told me all\nSo often that I speak as having seen.\n\nFor so it seemed, or so they said to me,\nThat all things grew more tragic and more strange;\nThat when our side was vanquished and my cause\nFor ever lost, there went up a great cry,\nThe Prince is slain. My father heard and ran\nIn on the lists, and there unlaced my casque\nAnd grovelled on my body, and after him\nCame Psyche, sorrowing for Agla\u00efa.\nBut high upon the palace Ida stood\nWith Psyche's babe in arm: there on the roofs\nLike that great dame of Lapidoth she sang.\n\n'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen: the seed,\nThe little seed they laughed at in the dark,\nHas risen and cleft the soil, and grown a bulk\nOf spanless girth, that lays on every side\nA thousand arms and rushes to the Sun.\n\n'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen: they came;\nThe leaves were wet with women's tears: they heard\nA noise of songs they would not understand:\nThey marked it with the red cross to the fall,\nAnd would have strown it, and are fallen themselves.\n\n'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen: they came,\nThe woodmen with their axes: lo the tree!\nBut we will make it faggots for the hearth,\nAnd shape it plank and beam for roof and floor,\nAnd boats and bridges for the use of men.\n\n'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen: they struck;\nWith their own blows they hurt themselves, nor knew\nThere dwelt an iron nature in the grain:\nThe glittering axe was broken in their arms,\nTheir arms were shattered to the shoulder blade.\n\n'Our enemies have fallen, but this shall grow\nA night of Summer from the heat, a breadth\nOf Autumn, dropping fruits of power: and rolled\nWith music in the growing breeze of Time,\nThe tops shall strike from star to star, the fangs\nShall move the stony bases of the world.\n\n'And now, O maids, behold our sanctuary\nIs violate, our laws broken: fear we not\nTo break them more in their behoof, whose arms\nChampioned our cause and won it with a day\nBlanched in our annals, and perpetual feast,\nWhen dames and heroines of the golden year\nShall strip a hundred hollows bare of Spring,\nTo rain an April of ovation round\nTheir statues, borne aloft, the three: but come,\nWe will be liberal, since our rights are won.\nLet them not lie in the tents with coarse mankind,\nIll nurses; but descend, and proffer these\nThe brethren of our blood and cause, that there\nLie bruised and maimed, the tender ministries\nOf female hands and hospitality.'\n\nShe spoke, and with the babe yet in her arms,\nDescending, burst the great bronze valves, and led\nA hundred maids in train across the Park.\nSome cowled, and some bare-headed, on they came,\nTheir feet in flowers, her loveliest: by them went\nThe enamoured air sighing, and on their curls\nFrom the high tree the blossom wavering fell,\nAnd over them the tremulous isles of light\nSlided, they moving under shade: but Blanche\nAt distance followed: so they came: anon\nThrough open field into the lists they wound\nTimorously; and as the leader of the herd\nThat holds a stately fretwork to the Sun,\nAnd followed up by a hundred airy does,\nSteps with a tender foot, light as on air,\nThe lovely, lordly creature floated on\nTo where her wounded brethren lay; there stayed;\nKnelt on one knee,--the child on one,--and prest\nTheir hands, and called them dear deliverers,\nAnd happy warriors, and immortal names,\nAnd said 'You shall not lie in the tents but here,\nAnd nursed by those for whom you fought, and served\nWith female hands and hospitality.'\n\nThen, whether moved by this, or was it chance,\nShe past my way. Up started from my side\nThe old lion, glaring with his whelpless eye,\nSilent; but when she saw me lying stark,\nDishelmed and mute, and motionlessly pale,\nCold even to her, she sighed; and when she saw\nThe haggard father's face and reverend beard\nOf grisly twine, all dabbled with the blood\nOf his own son, shuddered, a twitch of pain\nTortured her mouth, and o'er her forehead past\nA shadow, and her hue changed, and she said:\n'He saved my life: my brother slew him for it.'\nNo more: at which the king in bitter scorn\nDrew from my neck the painting and the tress,\nAnd held them up: she saw them, and a day\nRose from the distance on her memory,\nWhen the good Queen, her mother, shore the tress\nWith kisses, ere the days of Lady Blanche:\nAnd then once more she looked at my pale face:\nTill understanding all the foolish work\nOf Fancy, and the bitter close of all,\nHer iron will was broken in her mind;\nHer noble heart was molten in her breast;\nShe bowed, she set the child on the earth; she laid\nA feeling finger on my brows, and presently\n'O Sire,' she said, 'he lives: he is not dead:\nO let me have him with my brethren here\nIn our own palace: we will tend on him\nLike one of these; if so, by any means,\nTo lighten this great clog of thanks, that make\nOur progress falter to the woman's goal.'\n\nShe said: but at the happy word 'he lives'\nMy father stooped, re-fathered o'er my wounds.\nSo those two foes above my fallen life,\nWith brow to brow like night and evening mixt\nTheir dark and gray, while Psyche ever stole\nA little nearer, till the babe that by us,\nHalf-lapt in glowing gauze and golden brede,\nLay like a new-fallen meteor on the grass,\nUncared for, spied its mother and began\nA blind and babbling laughter, and to dance\nIts body, and reach its fatling innocent arms\nAnd lazy lingering fingers. She the appeal\nBrooked not, but clamouring out 'Mine--mine--not yours,\nIt is not yours, but mine: give me the child'\nCeased all on tremble: piteous was the cry:\nSo stood the unhappy mother open-mouthed,\nAnd turned each face her way: wan was her cheek\nWith hollow watch, her blooming mantle torn,\nRed grief and mother's hunger in her eye,\nAnd down dead-heavy sank her curls, and half\nThe sacred mother's bosom, panting, burst\nThe laces toward her babe; but she nor cared\nNor knew it, clamouring on, till Ida heard,\nLooked up, and rising slowly from me, stood\nErect and silent, striking with her glance\nThe mother, me, the child; but he that lay\nBeside us, Cyril, battered as he was,\nTrailed himself up on one knee: then he drew\nHer robe to meet his lips, and down she looked\nAt the armed man sideways, pitying as it seemed,\nOr self-involved; but when she learnt his face,\nRemembering his ill-omened song, arose\nOnce more through all her height, and o'er him grew\nTall as a figure lengthened on the sand\nWhen the tide ebbs in sunshine, and he said:\n\n'O fair and strong and terrible! Lioness\nThat with your long locks play the Lion's mane!\nBut Love and Nature, these are two more terrible\nAnd stronger. See, your foot is on our necks,\nWe vanquished, you the Victor of your will.\nWhat would you more? Give her the child! remain\nOrbed in your isolation: he is dead,\nOr all as dead: henceforth we let you be:\nWin you the hearts of women; and beware\nLest, where you seek the common love of these,\nThe common hate with the revolving wheel\nShould drag you down, and some great Nemesis\nBreak from a darkened future, crowned with fire,\nAnd tread you out for ever: but howso'er\nFixed in yourself, never in your own arms\nTo hold your own, deny not hers to her,\nGive her the child! O if, I say, you keep\nOne pulse that beats true woman, if you loved\nThe breast that fed or arm that dandled you,\nOr own one port of sense not flint to prayer,\nGive her the child! or if you scorn to lay it,\nYourself, in hands so lately claspt with yours,\nOr speak to her, your dearest, her one fault,\nThe tenderness, not yours, that could not kill,\nGive ~me~ it: ~I~ will give it her.\nHe said:\nAt first her eye with slow dilation rolled\nDry flame, she listening; after sank and sank\nAnd, into mournful twilight mellowing, dwelt\nFull on the child; she took it: 'Pretty bud!\nLily of the vale! half opened bell of the woods!\nSole comfort of my dark hour, when a world\nOf traitorous friend and broken system made\nNo purple in the distance, mystery,\nPledge of a love not to be mine, farewell;\nThese men are hard upon us as of old,\nWe two must part: and yet how fain was I\nTo dream thy cause embraced in mine, to think\nI might be something to thee, when I felt\nThy helpless warmth about my barren breast\nIn the dead prime: but may thy mother prove\nAs true to thee as false, false, false to me!\nAnd, if thou needs must needs bear the yoke, I wish it\nGentle as freedom'--here she kissed it: then--\n'All good go with thee! take it Sir,' and so\nLaid the soft babe in his hard-mail\u00e8d hands,\nWho turned half-round to Psyche as she sprang\nTo meet it, with an eye that swum in thanks;\nThen felt it sound and whole from head to foot,\nAnd hugged and never hugged it close enough,\nAnd in her hunger mouthed and mumbled it,\nAnd hid her bosom with it; after that\nPut on more calm and added suppliantly:\n\n'We two were friends: I go to mine own land\nFor ever: find some other: as for me\nI scarce am fit for your great plans: yet speak to me,\nSay one soft word and let me part forgiven.'\n\nBut Ida spoke not, rapt upon the child.\nThen Arac. 'Ida--'sdeath! you blame the man;\nYou wrong yourselves--the woman is so hard\nUpon the woman. Come, a grace to me!\nI am your warrior: I and mine have fought\nYour battle: kiss her; take her hand, she weeps:\n'Sdeath! I would sooner fight thrice o'er than see it.'\n\nBut Ida spoke not, gazing on the ground,\nAnd reddening in the furrows of his chin,\nAnd moved beyond his custom, Gama said:\n\n'I've heard that there is iron in the blood,\nAnd I believe it. Not one word? not one?\nWhence drew you this steel temper? not from me,\nNot from your mother, now a saint with saints.\nShe said you had a heart--I heard her say it--\n\"Our Ida has a heart\"--just ere she died--\n\"But see that some on with authority\nBe near her still\" and I--I sought for one--\nAll people said she had authority--\nThe Lady Blanche: much profit! Not one word;\nNo! though your father sues: see how you stand\nStiff as Lot's wife, and all the good knights maimed,\nI trust that there is no one hurt to death,\nFor our wild whim: and was it then for this,\nWas it for this we gave our palace up,\nWhere we withdrew from summer heats and state,\nAnd had our wine and chess beneath the planes,\nAnd many a pleasant hour with her that's gone,\nEre you were born to vex us? Is it kind?\nSpeak to her I say: is this not she of whom,\nWhen first she came, all flushed you said to me\nNow had you got a friend of your own age,\nNow could you share your thought; now should men see\nTwo women faster welded in one love\nThan pairs of wedlock; she you walked with, she\nYou talked with, whole nights long, up in the tower,\nOf sine and arc, sphero\u00efd and azimuth,\nAnd right ascension, Heaven knows what; and now\nA word, but one, one little kindly word,\nNot one to spare her: out upon you, flint!\nYou love nor her, nor me, nor any; nay,\nYou shame your mother's judgment too. Not one?\nYou will not? well--no heart have you, or such\nAs fancies like the vermin in a nut\nHave fretted all to dust and bitterness.'\nSo said the small king moved beyond his won't.\n\nBut Ida stood nor spoke, drained of her force\nBy many a varying influence and so long.\nDown through her limbs a drooping languor wept:\nHer head a little bent; and on her mouth\nA doubtful smile dwelt like a clouded moon\nIn a still water: then brake out my sire,\nLifted his grim head from my wounds. 'O you,\nWoman, whom we thought woman even now,\nAnd were half fooled to let you tend our son,\nBecause he might have wished it--but we see,\nThe accomplice of your madness unforgiven,\nAnd think that you might mix his draught with death,\nWhen your skies change again: the rougher hand\nIs safer: on to the tents: take up the Prince.'\n\nHe rose, and while each ear was pricked to attend\nA tempest, through the cloud that dimmed her broke\nA genial warmth and light once more, and shone\nThrough glittering drops on her sad friend.\n'Come hither.\nO Psyche,' she cried out, 'embrace me, come,\nQuick while I melt; make reconcilement sure\nWith one that cannot keep her mind an hour:\nCome to the hollow hear they slander so!\nKiss and be friends, like children being chid!\n~I~ seem no more: ~I~ want forgiveness too:\nI should have had to do with none but maids,\nThat have no links with men. Ah false but dear,\nDear traitor, too much loved, why?--why?--Yet see,\nBefore these kings we embrace you yet once more\nWith all forgiveness, all oblivion,\nAnd trust, not love, you less.\nAnd now, O sire,\nGrant me your son, to nurse, to wait upon him,\nLike mine own brother. For my debt to him,\nThis nightmare weight of gratitude, I know it;\nTaunt me no more: yourself and yours shall have\nFree adit; we will scatter all our maids\nTill happier times each to her proper hearth:\nWhat use to keep them here--now? grant my prayer.\nHelp, father, brother, help; speak to the king:\nThaw this male nature to some touch of that\nWhich kills me with myself, and drags me down\nFrom my fixt height to mob me up with all\nThe soft and milky rabble of womankind,\nPoor weakling even as they are.'\nPassionate tears\nFollowed: the king replied not: Cyril said:\n'Your brother, Lady,--Florian,--ask for him\nOf your great head--for he is wounded too--\nThat you may tend upon him with the prince.'\n'Ay so,' said Ida with a bitter smile,\n'Our laws are broken: let him enter too.'\nThen Violet, she that sang the mournful song,\nAnd had a cousin tumbled on the plain,\nPetitioned too for him. 'Ay so,' she said,\n'I stagger in the stream: I cannot keep\nMy heart an eddy from the brawling hour:\nWe break our laws with ease, but let it be.'\n'Ay so?' said Blanche: 'Amazed am I to her\nYour Highness: but your Highness breaks with ease\nThe law your Highness did not make: 'twas I.\nI had been wedded wife, I knew mankind,\nAnd blocked them out; but these men came to woo\nYour Highness--verily I think to win.'\n\nSo she, and turned askance a wintry eye:\nBut Ida with a voice, that like a bell\nTolled by an earthquake in a trembling tower,\nRang ruin, answered full of grief and scorn.\n\n'Fling our doors wide! all, all, not one, but all,\nNot only he, but by my mother's soul,\nWhatever man lies wounded, friend or foe,\nShall enter, if he will. Let our girls flit,\nTill the storm die! but had you stood by us,\nThe roar that breaks the Pharos from his base\nHad left us rock. She fain would sting us too,\nBut shall not. Pass, and mingle with your likes.\nWe brook no further insult but are gone.'\nShe turned; the very nape of her white neck\nWas rosed with indignation: but the Prince\nHer brother came; the king her father charmed\nHer wounded soul with words: nor did mine own\nRefuse her proffer, lastly gave his hand.\n\nThen us they lifted up, dead weights, and bare\nStraight to the doors: to them the doors gave way\nGroaning, and in the Vestal entry shrieked\nThe virgin marble under iron heels:\nAnd on they moved and gained the hall, and there\nRested: but great the crush was, and each base,\nTo left and right, of those tall columns drowned\nIn silken fluctuation and the swarm\nOf female whisperers: at the further end\nWas Ida by the throne, the two great cats\nClose by her, like supporters on a shield,\nBow-backed with fear: but in the centre stood\nThe common men with rolling eyes; amazed\nThey glared upon the women, and aghast\nThe women stared at these, all silent, save\nWhen armour clashed or jingled, while the day,\nDescending, struck athwart the hall, and shot\nA flying splendour out of brass and steel,\nThat o'er the statues leapt from head to head,\nNow fired an angry Pallas on the helm,\nNow set a wrathful Dian's moon on flame,\nAnd now and then an echo started up,\nAnd shuddering fled from room to room, and died\nOf fright in far apartments.\nThen the voice\nOf Ida sounded, issuing ordinance:\nAnd me they bore up the broad stairs, and through\nThe long-laid galleries past a hundred doors\nTo one deep chamber shut from sound, and due\nTo languid limbs and sickness; left me in it;\nAnd others otherwhere they laid; and all\nThat afternoon a sound arose of hoof\nAnd chariot, many a maiden passing home\nTill happier times; but some were left of those\nHeld sagest, and the great lords out and in,\nFrom those two hosts that lay beside the walls,\nWalked at their will, and everything was changed.\n\nAsk me no more: the moon may draw the sea;\nThe cloud may stoop from heaven and take the shape\nWith fold to fold, of mountain or of cape;\nBut O too fond, when have I answered thee?\nAsk me no more.\n\nAsk me no more: what answer should I give?\nI love not hollow cheek or faded eye:\nYet, O my friend, I will not have thee die!\nAsk me no more, lest I should bid thee live;\nAsk me no more.\n\nAsk me no more: thy fate and mine are sealed:\nI strove against the stream and all in vain:\nLet the great river take me to the main:\nNo more, dear love, for at a touch I yield;\nAsk me no more.\n\nVII\n\nSo was their sanctuary violated,\nSo their fair college turned to hospital;\nAt first with all confusion: by and by\nSweet order lived again with other laws:\nA kindlier influence reigned; and everywhere\nLow voices with the ministering hand\nHung round the sick: the maidens came, they talked,\nThey sang, they read: till she not fair began\nTo gather light, and she that was, became\nHer former beauty treble; and to and fro\nWith books, with flowers, with Angel offices,\nLike creatures native unto gracious act,\nAnd in their own clear element, they moved.\n\nBut sadness on the soul of Ida fell,\nAnd hatred of her weakness, blent with shame.\nOld studies failed; seldom she spoke: but oft\nClomb to the roofs, and gazed alone for hours\nOn that disastrous leaguer, swarms of men\nDarkening her female field: void was her use,\nAnd she as one that climbs a peak to gaze\nO'er land and main, and sees a great black cloud\nDrag inward from the deeps, a wall of night,\nBlot out the slope of sea from verge to shore,\nAnd suck the blinding splendour from the sand,\nAnd quenching lake by lake and tarn by tarn\nExpunge the world: so fared she gazing there;\nSo blackened all her world in secret, blank\nAnd waste it seemed and vain; till down she came,\nAnd found fair peace once more among the sick.\n\nAnd twilight dawned; and morn by morn the lark\nShot up and shrilled in flickering gyres, but I\nLay silent in the muffled cage of life:\nAnd twilight gloomed; and broader-grown the bowers\nDrew the great night into themselves, and Heaven,\nStar after Star, arose and fell; but I,\nDeeper than those weird doubts could reach me, lay\nQuite sundered from the moving Universe,\nNor knew what eye was on me, nor the hand\nThat nursed me, more than infants in their sleep.\n\nBut Psyche tended Florian: with her oft,\nMelissa came; for Blanche had gone, but left\nHer child among us, willing she should keep\nCourt-favour: here and there the small bright head,\nA light of healing, glanced about the couch,\nOr through the parted silks the tender face\nPeeped, shining in upon the wounded man\nWith blush and smile, a medicine in themselves\nTo wile the length from languorous hours, and draw\nThe sting from pain; nor seemed it strange that soon\nHe rose up whole, and those fair charities\nJoined at her side; nor stranger seemed that hears\nSo gentle, so employed, should close in love,\nThan when two dewdrops on the petals shake\nTo the same sweet air, and tremble deeper down,\nAnd slip at once all-fragrant into one.\n\nLess prosperously the second suit obtained\nAt first with Psyche. Not though Blanche had sworn\nThat after that dark night among the fields\nShe needs must wed him for her own good name;\nNot though he built upon the babe restored;\nNor though she liked him, yielded she, but feared\nTo incense the Head once more; till on a day\nWhen Cyril pleaded, Ida came behind\nSeen but of Psyche: on her foot she hung\nA moment, and she heard, at which her face\nA little flushed, and she past on; but each\nAssumed from thence a half-consent involved\nIn stillness, plighted troth, and were at peace.\n\nNor only these: Love in the sacred halls\nHeld carnival at will, and flying struck\nWith showers of random sweet on maid and man.\nNor did her father cease to press my claim,\nNor did mine own, now reconciled; nor yet\nDid those twin-brothers, risen again and whole;\nNor Arac, satiate with his victory.\n\nBut I lay still, and with me oft she sat:\nThen came a change; for sometimes I would catch\nHer hand in wild delirium, gripe it hard,\nAnd fling it like a viper off, and shriek\n'You are not Ida;' clasp it once again,\nAnd call her Ida, though I knew her not,\nAnd call her sweet, as if in irony,\nAnd call her hard and cold which seemed a truth:\nAnd still she feared that I should lose my mind,\nAnd often she believed that I should die:\nTill out of long frustration of her care,\nAnd pensive tendance in the all-weary noons,\nAnd watches in the dead, the dark, when clocks\nThrobbed thunder through the palace floors, or called\nOn flying Time from all their silver tongues--\nAnd out of memories of her kindlier days,\nAnd sidelong glances at my father's grief,\nAnd at the happy lovers heart in heart--\nAnd out of hauntings of my spoken love,\nAnd lonely listenings to my muttered dream,\nAnd often feeling of the helpless hands,\nAnd wordless broodings on the wasted cheek--\nFrom all a closer interest flourished up,\nTenderness touch by touch, and last, to these,\nLove, like an Alpine harebell hung with tears\nBy some cold morning glacier; frail at first\nAnd feeble, all unconscious of itself,\nBut such as gathered colour day by day.\n\nLast I woke sane, but well-nigh close to death\nFor weakness: it was evening: silent light\nSlept on the painted walls, wherein were wrought\nTwo grand designs; for on one side arose\nThe women up in wild revolt, and stormed\nAt the Oppian Law. Titanic shapes, they crammed\nThe forum, and half-crushed among the rest\nA dwarf-like Cato cowered. On the other side\nHortensia spoke against the tax; behind,\nA train of dames: by axe and eagle sat,\nWith all their foreheads drawn in Roman scowls,\nAnd half the wolf's-milk curdled in their veins,\nThe fierce triumvirs; and before them paused\nHortensia pleading: angry was her face.\n\nI saw the forms: I knew not where I was:\nThey did but look like hollow shows; nor more\nSweet Ida: palm to palm she sat: the dew\nDwelt in her eyes, and softer all her shape\nAnd rounder seemed: I moved: I sighed: a touch\nCame round my wrist, and tears upon my hand:\nThen all for languor and self-pity ran\nMine down my face, and with what life I had,\nAnd like a flower that cannot all unfold,\nSo drenched it is with tempest, to the sun,\nYet, as it may, turns toward him, I on her\nFixt my faint eyes, and uttered whisperingly:\n\n'If you be, what I think you, some sweet dream,\nI would but ask you to fulfil yourself:\nBut if you be that Ida whom I knew,\nI ask you nothing: only, if a dream,\nSweet dream, be perfect. I shall die tonight.\nStoop down and seem to kiss me ere I die.'\n\nI could no more, but lay like one in trance,\nThat hears his burial talked of by his friends,\nAnd cannot speak, nor move, nor make one sign,\nBut lies and dreads his doom. She turned; she paused;\nShe stooped; and out of languor leapt a cry;\nLeapt fiery Passion from the brinks of death;\nAnd I believed that in the living world\nMy spirit closed with Ida's at the lips;\nTill back I fell, and from mine arms she rose\nGlowing all over noble shame; and all\nHer falser self slipt from her like a robe,\nAnd left her woman, lovelier in her mood\nThan in her mould that other, when she came\nFrom barren deeps to conquer all with love;\nAnd down the streaming crystal dropt; and she\nFar-fleeted by the purple island-sides,\nNaked, a double light in air and wave,\nTo meet her Graces, where they decked her out\nFor worship without end; nor end of mine,\nStateliest, for thee! but mute she glided forth,\nNor glanced behind her, and I sank and slept,\nFilled through and through with Love, a happy sleep.\n\nDeep in the night I woke: she, near me, held\nA volume of the Poets of her land:\nThere to herself, all in low tones, she read.\n\n'Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;\nNor waves the cypress in the palace walk;\nNor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font:\nThe fire-fly wakens: wake thou with me.\n\nNow droops the milkwhite peacock like a ghost,\nAnd like a ghost she glimmers on to me.\n\nNow lies the Earth all Dana\u00eb to the stars,\nAnd all thy heart lies open unto me.\n\nNow lies the silent meteor on, and leaves\nA shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.\n\nNow folds the lily all her sweetness up,\nAnd slips into the bosom of the lake:\nSo fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip\nInto my bosom and be lost in me.'\n\nI heard her turn the page; she found a small\nSweet Idyl, and once more, as low, she read:\n\n'Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height:\nWhat pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang)\nIn height and cold, the splendour of the hills?\nBut cease to move so near the Heavens, and cease\nTo glide a sunbeam by the blasted Pine,\nTo sit a star upon the sparkling spire;\nAnd come, for love is of the valley, come,\nFor love is of the valley, come thou down\nAnd find him; by the happy threshold, he,\nOr hand in hand with Plenty in the maize,\nOr red with spirted purple of the vats,\nOr foxlike in the vine; nor cares to walk\nWith Death and Morning on the silver horns,\nNor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine,\nNor find him dropt upon the firths of ice,\nThat huddling slant in furrow-cloven falls\nTo roll the torrent out of dusky doors:\nBut follow; let the torrent dance thee down\nTo find him in the valley; let the wild\nLean-headed Eagles yelp alone, and leave\nThe monstrous ledges there to slope, and spill\nTheir thousand wreaths of dangling water-smoke,\nThat like a broken purpose waste in air:\nSo waste not thou; but come; for all the vales\nAwait thee; azure pillars of the hearth\nArise to thee; the children call, and I\nThy shepherd pipe, and sweet is every sound,\nSweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet;\nMyriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn,\nThe moan of doves in immemorial elms,\nAnd murmuring of innumerable bees.'\n\nSo she low-toned; while with shut eyes I lay\nListening; then looked. Pale was the perfect face;\nThe bosom with long sighs laboured; and meek\nSeemed the full lips, and mild the luminous eyes,\nAnd the voice trembled and the hand. She said\nBrokenly, that she knew it, she had failed\nIn sweet humility; had failed in all;\nThat all her labour was but as a block\nLeft in the quarry; but she still were loth,\nShe still were loth to yield herself to one\nThat wholly scorned to help their equal rights\nAgainst the sons of men, and barbarous laws.\nShe prayed me not to judge their cause from her\nThat wronged it, sought far less for truth than power\nIn knowledge: something wild within her breast,\nA greater than all knowledge, beat her down.\nAnd she had nursed me there from week to week:\nMuch had she learnt in little time. In part\nIt was ill counsel had misled the girl\nTo vex true hearts: yet was she but a girl--\n'Ah fool, and made myself a Queen of farce!\nWhen comes another such? never, I think,\nTill the Sun drop, dead, from the signs.'\nHer voice\nchoked, and her forehead sank upon her hands,\nAnd her great heart through all the faultful Past\nWent sorrowing in a pause I dared not break;\nTill notice of a change in the dark world\nWas lispt about the acacias, and a bird,\nThat early woke to feed her little ones,\nSent from a dewy breast a cry for light:\nShe moved, and at her feet the volume fell.\n\n'Blame not thyself too much,' I said, 'nor blame\nToo much the sons of men and barbarous laws;\nThese were the rough ways of the world till now.\nHenceforth thou hast a helper, me, that know\nThe woman's cause is man's: they rise or sink\nTogether, dwarfed or godlike, bond or free:\nFor she that out of Lethe scales with man\nThe shining steps of Nature, shares with man\nHis nights, his days, moves with him to one goal,\nStays all the fair young planet in her hands--\nIf she be small, slight-natured, miserable,\nHow shall men grow? but work no more alone!\nOur place is much: as far as in us lies\nWe two will serve them both in aiding her--\nWill clear away the parasitic forms\nThat seem to keep her up but drag her down--\nWill leave her space to burgeon out of all\nWithin her--let her make herself her own\nTo give or keep, to live and learn and be\nAll that not harms distinctive womanhood.\nFor woman is not undevelopt man,\nBut diverse: could we make her as the man,\nSweet Love were slain: his dearest bond is this,\nNot like to like, but like in difference.\nYet in the long years liker must they grow;\nThe man be more of woman, she of man;\nHe gain in sweetness and in moral height,\nNor lose the wrestling thews that throw the world;\nShe mental breadth, nor fail in childward care,\nNor lose the childlike in the larger mind;\nTill at the last she set herself to man,\nLike perfect music unto noble words;\nAnd so these twain, upon the skirts of Time,\nSit side by side, full-summed in all their powers,\nDispensing harvest, sowing the To-be,\nSelf-reverent each and reverencing each,\nDistinct in individualities,\nBut like each other even as those who love.\nThen comes the statelier Eden back to men:\nThen reign the world's great bridals, chaste and calm:\nThen springs the crowning race of humankind.\nMay these things be!'\nSighing she spoke 'I fear\nThey will not.'\n'Dear, but let us type them now\nIn our own lives, and this proud watchword rest\nOf equal; seeing either sex alone\nIs half itself, and in true marriage lies\nNor equal, nor unequal: each fulfils\nDefect in each, and always thought in thought,\nPurpose in purpose, will in will, they grow,\nThe single pure and perfect animal,\nThe two-celled heart beating, with one full stroke,\nLife.'\nAnd again sighing she spoke: 'A dream\nThat once was mind! what woman taught you this?'\n\n'Alone,' I said, 'from earlier than I know,\nImmersed in rich foreshadowings of the world,\nI loved the woman: he, that doth not, lives\nA drowning life, besotted in sweet self,\nOr pines in sad experience worse than death,\nOr keeps his winged affections clipt with crime:\nYet was there one through whom I loved her, one\nNot learn\u00e8d, save in gracious household ways,\nNot perfect, nay, but full of tender wants,\nNo Angel, but a dearer being, all dipt\nIn Angel instincts, breathing Paradise,\nInterpreter between the Gods and men,\nWho looked all native to her place, and yet\nOn tiptoe seemed to touch upon a sphere\nToo gross to tread, and all male minds perforce\nSwayed to her from their orbits as they moved,\nAnd girdled her with music. Happy he\nWith such a mother! faith in womankind\nBeats with his blood, and trust in all things high\nComes easy to him, and though he trip and fall\nHe shall not blind his soul with clay.'\n'But I,'\nSaid Ida, tremulously, 'so all unlike--\nIt seems you love to cheat yourself with words:\nThis mother is your model. I have heard\nof your strange doubts: they well might be: I seem\nA mockery to my own self. Never, Prince;\nYou cannot love me.'\n'Nay but thee' I said\n'From yearlong poring on thy pictured eyes,\nEre seen I loved, and loved thee seen, and saw\nThee woman through the crust of iron moods\nThat masked thee from men's reverence up, and forced\nSweet love on pranks of saucy boyhood: now,\nGiven back to life, to life indeed, through thee,\nIndeed I love: the new day comes, the light\nDearer for night, as dearer thou for faults\nLived over: lift thine eyes; my doubts are dead,\nMy haunting sense of hollow shows: the change,\nThis truthful change in thee has killed it. Dear,\nLook up, and let thy nature strike on mine,\nLike yonder morning on the blind half-world;\nApproach and fear not; breathe upon my brows;\nIn that fine air I tremble, all the past\nMelts mist-like into this bright hour, and this\nIs morn to more, and all the rich to-come\nReels, as the golden Autumn woodland reels\nAthwart the smoke of burning weeds. Forgive me,\nI waste my heart in signs: let be. My bride,\nMy wife, my life. O we will walk this world,\nYoked in all exercise of noble end,\nAnd so through those dark gates across the wild\nThat no man knows. Indeed I love thee: come,\nYield thyself up: my hopes and thine are one:\nAccomplish thou my manhood and thyself;\nLay thy sweet hands in mine and trust to me.'\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSo closed our tale, of which I give you all\nThe random scheme as wildly as it rose:\nThe words are mostly mine; for when we ceased\nThere came a minute's pause, and Walter said,\n'I wish she had not yielded!' then to me,\n'What, if you drest it up poetically?'\nSo prayed the men, the women: I gave assent:\nYet how to bind the scattered scheme of seven\nTogether in one sheaf? What style could suit?\nThe men required that I should give throughout\nThe sort of mock-heroic gigantesque,\nWith which we bantered little Lilia first:\nThe women--and perhaps they felt their power,\nFor something in the ballads which they sang,\nOr in their silent influence as they sat,\nHad ever seemed to wrestle with burlesque,\nAnd drove us, last, to quite a solemn close--\nThey hated banter, wished for something real,\nA gallant fight, a noble princess--why\nNot make her true-heroic--true-sublime?\nOr all, they said, as earnest as the close?\nWhich yet with such a framework scarce could be.\nThen rose a little feud betwixt the two,\nBetwixt the mockers and the realists:\nAnd I, betwixt them both, to please them both,\nAnd yet to give the story as it rose,\nI moved as in a strange diagonal,\nAnd maybe neither pleased myself nor them.\n\nBut Lilia pleased me, for she took no part\nIn our dispute: the sequel of the tale\nHad touched her; and she sat, she plucked the grass,\nShe flung it from her, thinking: last, she fixt\nA showery glance upon her aunt, and said,\n'You--tell us what we are' who might have told,\nFor she was crammed with theories out of books,\nBut that there rose a shout: the gates were closed\nAt sunset, and the crowd were swarming now,\nTo take their leave, about the garden rails.\n\nSo I and some went out to these: we climbed\nThe slope to Vivian-place, and turning saw\nThe happy valleys, half in light, and half\nFar-shadowing from the west, a land of peace;\nGray halls alone among their massive groves;\nTrim hamlets; here and there a rustic tower\nHalf-lost in belts of hop and breadths of wheat;\nThe shimmering glimpses of a stream; the seas;\nA red sail, or a white; and far beyond,\nImagined more than seen, the skirts of France.\n\n'Look there, a garden!' said my college friend,\nThe Tory member's elder son, 'and there!\nGod bless the narrow sea which keeps her off,\nAnd keeps our Britain, whole within herself,\nA nation yet, the rulers and the ruled--\nSome sense of duty, something of a faith,\nSome reverence for the laws ourselves have made,\nSome patient force to change them when we will,\nSome civic manhood firm against the crowd--\nBut yonder, whiff! there comes a sudden heat,\nThe gravest citizen seems to lose his head,\nThe king is scared, the soldier will not fight,\nThe little boys begin to shoot and stab,\nA kingdom topples over with a shriek\nLike an old woman, and down rolls the world\nIn mock heroics stranger than our own;\nRevolts, republics, revolutions, most\nNo graver than a schoolboys' barring out;\nToo comic for the serious things they are,\nToo solemn for the comic touches in them,\nLike our wild Princess with as wise a dream\nAs some of theirs--God bless the narrow seas!\nI wish they were a whole Atlantic broad.'\n\n'Have patience,' I replied, 'ourselves are full\nOf social wrong; and maybe wildest dreams\nAre but the needful preludes of the truth:\nFor me, the genial day, the happy crowd,\nThe sport half-science, fill me with a faith.\nThis fine old world of ours is but a child\nYet in the go-cart. Patience! Give it time\nTo learn its limbs: there is a hand that guides.'\n\nIn such discourse we gained the garden rails,\nAnd there we saw Sir Walter where he stood,\nBefore a tower of crimson holly-hoaks,\nAmong six boys, head under head, and looked\nNo little lily-handed Baronet he,\nA great broad-shouldered genial Englishman,\nA lord of fat prize-oxen and of sheep,\nA raiser of huge melons and of pine,\nA patron of some thirty charities,\nA pamphleteer on guano and on grain,\nA quarter-sessions chairman, abler none;\nFair-haired and redder than a windy morn;\nNow shaking hands with him, now him, of those\nThat stood the nearest--now addressed to speech--\nWho spoke few words and pithy, such as closed\nWelcome, farewell, and welcome for the year\nTo follow: a shout rose again, and made\nThe long line of the approaching rookery swerve\nFrom the elms, and shook the branches of the deer\nFrom slope to slope through distant ferns, and rang\nBeyond the bourn of sunset; O, a shout\nMore joyful than the city-roar that hails\nPremier or king! Why should not these great Sirs\nGive up their parks some dozen times a year\nTo let the people breathe? So thrice they cried,\nI likewise, and in groups they streamed away.\n\nBut we went back to the Abbey, and sat on,\nSo much the gathering darkness charmed: we sat\nBut spoke not, rapt in nameless reverie,\nPerchance upon the future man: the walls\nBlackened about us, bats wheeled, and owls whooped,\nAnd gradually the powers of the night,\nThat range above the region of the wind,\nDeepening the courts of twilight broke them up\nThrough all the silent spaces of the worlds,\nBeyond all thought into the Heaven of Heavens.\n\nLast little Lilia, rising quietly,\nDisrobed the glimmering statue of Sir Ralph\nFrom those rich silks, and home well-pleased we went.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/840622", "artist_names": "Hank Ballard & the Midnighters", "full_title": "Teardrops On Your Letter by\u00a0Hank\u00a0Ballard & the Midnighters", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/334b5434ff7d3ccdfd5d463a82475eff.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/334b5434ff7d3ccdfd5d463a82475eff.575x575x1.jpg", "id": 840622, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429279976, "path": "/Hank-ballard-and-the-midnighters-teardrops-on-your-letter-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Hank-ballard-and-the-midnighters-teardrops-on-your-letter-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1959, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1959", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1959", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/334b5434ff7d3ccdfd5d463a82475eff.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/334b5434ff7d3ccdfd5d463a82475eff.575x575x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Teardrops On Your Letter", "title_with_featured": "Teardrops On Your Letter", "updated_by_human_at": 1583012948, "url": "https://genius.com/Hank-ballard-and-the-midnighters-teardrops-on-your-letter-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/352209", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bb593226497e993a05030586271731d4.515x515x1.jpg", "id": 352209, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bb593226497e993a05030586271731d4.515x515x1.jpg", "index_character": "h", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Hank Ballard & the Midnighters", "slug": "Hank-ballard-and-the-midnighters", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Hank-ballard-and-the-midnighters"}, "artist": "Hank Ballard & the Midnighters", "lyrics": "Teardrops On Your Letter LyricsTeardrops on your letter\nThat I got from you\nMade me realize\nEvery word you wrote was true\nThat you miss me\n(You miss me)\nAnd wanna kiss me\n(Wanna kiss me)\nSo I'm coming home to you\nTeardrops on your letter\nOn each word I read\nWas the sweetest message\nThat you have ever said\nThey told me\n(They hold me)\nYou wanna hold me\n(Wanna hold me)\nSo I'm coming home to you\nI hate to know\nThat you been crying\nI hate to see\nSee you blue\nBut the teardrops\nOn your sweet letter\nStarted me to crying\nCrying, crying some too\nOh, oh\nTeardrops on your letter\nWas a certain sign\nWhen we're not together\nWe're on each other's mind\nCause I love you\n(I love you)\nI'm thinking of you\n(Thinking of you)\nSo I'm coming home to youYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/3915518", "artist_names": "Crew Cuervos", "full_title": "Maaamma!!

Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE\nhas secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even\nmore powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this\nultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels\nstruggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...\n\nPAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive\nsuperstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of\na giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small,\ngreen moon of ENDOR.\nAn Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored\nspace station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A small Imperial\nshuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the\nDeath Star.\n\n2    INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT\nThe shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star.\n\nSHUTTLE CAPTAIN\nCommand station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting\nour approach. Deactivate the security shield.\n\nDEATH STAR CONTROLLER\t(filtered VO)\nThe security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have\nconfirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to\nproceed.\n\nSHUTTLE CAPTAIN\nWe're starting our approach.\n\n3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\n\nOperators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR hits\nswitches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the Death\nStar, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible\ndeflector shield.\nA control officer rushes over to the shield operator.\n\nOFFICER\nInform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.\n\nOPERATOR\nYes, sir.\n\nThe control officer moves to a view port and watches as the Imperial\nshuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of Imperial\nstormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.\n\n4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY\n\nThe DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat,\nstrides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp.\nThe troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival.\nBut the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall.\n\nThe exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only\ndarkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this\nblack void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader looks over the\nassemblage as he walks down the ramp.\n\nJERJERROD\nLord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your\npresence.\n\nVADER\nYou may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you\nback on\nschedule.\n\nThe commander turns ashen and begins to shake.\n\nJERJERROD\nI assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.\n\nVADER\nPerhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.\n\nJERJERROD\nI tell you, this station will be operational as planned.\n\nVADER\nThe Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.\n\nJERJERROD\nBut he asks the impossible. I need more men.\n\nVADER\nThen perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.\n\nJERJERROD\t (aghast)\nThe Emperor's coming here?\n\nVADER\nThat is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your\napparent lack of progress.\n\nJERJERROD\nWe shall double our efforts.\n\nVADER\nI hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.\n\n5    EXT ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE\n\nA lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine\nterrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply before\ncatching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making their way along\nthe road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the Hutt.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOf course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and\npoor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.\n\nArtoo whistles timidly.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDon't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this\nJabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.\n\nThe two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.\n\n6    EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE\n\nThreepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly\nknocks on the iron door.\n\nTHREEPIO\t (instantly)\nThere doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master\nLuke.\n\nA small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical\narm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects\nthe two droids.\n\nSTRANGE VOICE\nTee chuta hhat yudd!\n\nTHREEPIO\nGoodness gracious me!\n\nThreepio points to Artoo, then to himself.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.\n\nThe eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the\neye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his\nconcern.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.\n\nArtoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly the\nmassive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The\nrobots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at\none another, afraid to enter.\n\nArtoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby\ncompanion. The door lowers noisily behind them.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should\nrush into all this.\n\nArtoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!\n\n7    INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY\n\nThe door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark\npassageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant, green GAMORREAN\nGUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances quickly back at the\ntwo lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One guard grunts an order.\nArtoo beeps nervously.\n\nTHREEPIO\nJust you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my!\nOh! Oh, no.\n\nWalking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike\nalien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.\n\nBIB\nDie Wanna Wanga!\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master,\nJabba the Hutt.\n\nArtoo lets out a series of quick beeps.\n\nTHREEPIO\t (cont)\n...and a gift.\n(thinks a moment, then to Artoo)\nGift, what gift?\n\nBib shakes his head negatively.\n\nBIB\nNee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.\n\nBib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit,\nletting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to the\nstrange-looking alien.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.\n\nBib thinks about this for a moment.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort\nof things.\n\nBib gestures for the droids to follow.\n\nBIB\nNudd Chaa.\n\nThe droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed\nby the two guards.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, I have a bad feeling about this.\n\n8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM\n\nThe throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES\never conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem very small as\nthey pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts\npartially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the\nroom to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating\ncrowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a\nrepulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the\nhorrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At\nthe foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS\nCRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba\nlaughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows\npolitely.\n\nTHREEPIO\nGood morning.\n\nJABBA\nBo Shuda!\n\nThe robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned\nvillain.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThe message, Artoo, the message.\n\nArtoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head,\ncreating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten\nfeet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters.\n\nLUKE\nGreetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke\nSkywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are\npowerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally\npowerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's\nlife.\n(Jabba's crowd laughs)\nWith your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which\nwill be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant\nconfrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift:\nthese two droids.\n\nThreepio is startled by this announcement.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat did he say?\n\nLUKE\t (cont)\n... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThis can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.\n\nLuke's hologram disappears.\n\nJabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nThere will be no bargain.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe're doomed.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nI will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he\nis.\n\nJabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne.\nHanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a\ncarbonized HAN SOLO.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.\n\n9    INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR\n\nOne of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a dank,\nshadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable\ncreatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm\nor tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps\npitifully.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did?\nHe never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!\n\nA large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break\nfree, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.\n\n10   INT BOILER ROOM\n\nThe door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy\nmachinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are\nmet by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9. Behind the robot can\nbe seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work\ndroid. A second power droid is upside down.  As smoking branding irons\nare pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized\nelectronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts to EV-\n9D9.\n\nNINEDENINE\nAh, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?\n\nTHREEPIO\nI am See-Threepio, human-cy...\n\nNINEDENINE\nYes or no will do.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh. Well, yes.\n\nNINEDENINE\nHow many languages do you speak?\n\nTHREEPIO\nI am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can\nreadily...\n\nNINEDENINE\nSplendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got\nangry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDisintegrated?\n\nNINEDENINE\t (to a Gamorrean guard)\nGuard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining\nbolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.\n\nThe guard shoves Threepio toward the door.\n\nTHREEPIO\t (disappearing)\nArtoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!\n\nArtoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps\nangrily.\n\nNINEDENINE\nYou're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have\nneed for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in\nnicely.\n\nThe poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured\nelectronic scream.\n\n11   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM\n\nThe court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous\nparty. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a\nfat female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne.\n\nJabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons\nOola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and backs away,\nshaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him.\n\nJABBA\nDa Eitha!\n\nThe lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.\n\nOOLA\nNa Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...\n\nJabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.\n\nJABBA\nBoscka!\n\nHe pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the\nfloor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps shut, a\nmuffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and his monstrous\nfriends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her\nfate through a grate.\n\nThreepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of Han\nSolo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen.\u00caAn\nunnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far side of the\nroom, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two\nguards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his\ncaptive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.\n\nBib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into\nhis ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba listens\nintently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a\ngreeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (Ubese).\n\nBOUSHH\t (in Ubese subtitled)\nI have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, no! Chewbacca!\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nAt last we have the mighty Chewbacca.\n\nJabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to\nThreepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!\n\nJabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh\nlistens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices\nBOBA FETT standing near the door.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the\nreward of twenty-five thousand.\n\nBOUSHH\t (in Ubese subtitled)\nI want fifty thousand. No less.\n\nJabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the\nraised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his\nweapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the\nthrone. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.\n\nTHREEPIO\nUh, oh... but what, what did I say?\n(to Boushh)\nUh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.\n\nThe bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio\nlooks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The\ndroid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.\n\nTHREEPIO\nBecause he's holding a thermal detonator.\n\nThe guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the\nroom. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the\nbounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba\nstares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across\nhis vast mouth and he begins to laugh.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nThis bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.\n\nJabba continues.\n\nTHREEPIO\nJabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.\n\nBib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his\nreaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes\ndead.\n\nBOUSHH\nZeebuss.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe agrees!\n\nThe raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and\napplause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca\ngrowls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a\nskiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing\ngirls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly\nappreciative creatures.\n\nBoushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the\nscene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across\nthe room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling\nhis weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.\n\n12   INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL\n\nGamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When\na tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes\nagainst the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror.\nIt takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming\nthe door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the\niron door.\n\n13   EXT JABBA'S PALACE\n\nThe palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the road in\nfront, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert\nrodent and burps in satisfaction.\n\n14   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT\n\nSilence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien\ncelebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several\ndrunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly.\n\nA shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of\nthe room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his\nway carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters.\n\nHan Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his\ncoffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter\ndeactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of\nthe coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.\n\nBoushh steps up to the case, studying Han, and then turns to the\ncontrols on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches\nand, after one last hesitant look at Han, slides the de-carbonization\nlever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the\ncontours of Han's face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches\nas Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands,\npreviously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His\nface muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.\n\nBoushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the breath\nof life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a start and he\nbegins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn.\n\nBOUSHH\nJust relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.\n\nHan touches his face with his hand and moans.\n\nBOUSHH\nShhh. You have hibernation sickness.\n\nHAN\nI can't see.\n\nBOUSHH\nYour eyesight will return in time.\n\nHAN\nWhere am I?\n\nBOUSHH\nJabba's palace.\n\nHAN\nWho are you?\n\nThe bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head,\nrevealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.\n\nLEIA\nSomeone who loves you.\n\nHAN\nLeia!\n\nLEIA\nI gotta get you out of here.\n\nAs Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet is\npierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of the alcove.\n\nHAN\nWhat's that? I know that laugh.\n\nThe curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the\nHutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his\ngross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.\n\nHAN\nHey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I\ngot a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.\n\nJabba laughs.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nIt's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but\nnow you're Bantha fodder.\n\nHAN\nLook...\n\nJABBA\t (cont Huttese subtitled)\nTake him away!\n\nThe guards grab Han and start to lead him away.\n\nHAN\nJabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here.\nDon't be a fool!\n\nHan is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead\nLeia away.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nBring her to me.\n\nJabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young\nprincess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly\nturns away in disgust.\n\nLEIA\nWe have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nI'm sure.\n\nInexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of Jabba's ugly\nblob of a head, and Leia turns away in disgust.\n\nLEIA\nUgh!\n\nTHREEPIO\nOhhh, I can't bear to watch.\n\n15   INT DUNGEON CELL\n\nThe heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. A\nguard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door\nslams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack\nin the door. Han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is\nheard from the far side of the cell. He jumps back against the cell\ndoor and listens.\n\nHAN\nChewie? Chewie, is that you?\n\nThe shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting\nhim off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light,\nrevealing Chewie.\n\nHAN\nAh! Chew--Chewie!\n\nThe giant Wookiee barks with glee.\n\nHAN\nWait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?\n\nChewie barks an excited blue streak.\n\nHAN\nLuke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less\nrescue anybody.\n\nChewie barks a reply.\n\nHAN\nA...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets\ndelusions of grandeur.\n\nChewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his head.\n\nHAN\nI'm all right, pal. I'm all right.\n\n16   INT MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACE\n\nNoisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding LIGHT\nand reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a\nrobe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke\nstrides purposefully into the hallway. Two giant guards move to block\nLuke's path. Luke halts.\n\nLuke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately\nlower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi lowers his hand and\nmoves on down the hallway.\n\nBib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they\napproach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his\ndirection and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry on the\nconversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.\n\nLUKE\nI must speak with Jabba.\n\nBib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and\nstares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.\n\nLUKE\nYou will take me to Jabba now!\n\nBib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him\ninto the gloom.\n\nLUKE\nYou serve your master well.\n\nBib responds.\n\nLUKE\nAnd you will be rewarded.\n\n17   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM\n\nJabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him.\nSalacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now\ndressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a\nmanacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the Hutt.\nThreepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug.\n\nTHREEPIO\nAt last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.\n\nBIB\nMaster.\n\nJabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese.\n\nBIB\n...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nI told you not to admit him.\n\nLUKE\nI must be allowed to speak.\n\nBIB\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nHe must be allowed to speak.\n\nJabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nYou weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.\n\nLuke stares hard at Jabba.\n\nLUKE\nYou will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nYour mind powers will not work on me, boy.\n\nLUKE\nNevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either\nprofit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not\nto underestimate my powers.\n\nJabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke about\nthe pit.\n\nTHREEPIO\nMaster Luke, you're standing on...\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nThere will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.\n\nLuke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies\ninto Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his\nhand.\n\nJABBA\nBascka!\n\nThe floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into\nthe pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba\nlaughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained\nby a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at\nhim and he shakes his head \"no.\"\n\n18   INT RANCOR PIT\n\nLuke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the\ndungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically\nfor help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in\nthe side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic.\nLuke looks calmly around for a means of escape.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, no! The Rancor!\n\nAt the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged\nRANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries\nfutilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.\n\nThe Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the\nRancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few\nscreams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers\nand laughs at the guard's fate.\n\nThe monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just\nahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of\nan earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his\nsalivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the\nmonster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in\nrage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an\navalanche.\n\nThe monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes\ninto a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the\nholding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility\ndoor--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into\nthe crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it\ndown on the Rancor's finger.\n\n19   HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT\n\nThe Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding\ncave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he\nsucceeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond\nthe gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the\nmonster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The\nguards move to the gate and start poking at the young Jedi with spears,\nlaughing.\n\nLuke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for\nhim. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall.\nAs the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the\ncave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes\ncrashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on\nan egg.\n\nA startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation\nat this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning\nred with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh\ncommands to his guards and they hurry off.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nBring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.\n\n21   INT RANCOR PIT\n\nThe Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining their dead\nbeast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other glares menacingly\nat Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush into the holding tunnel\nand take Luke away.\n\n22   INT THRONE ROOM\n\nThe crowd of creepy courtiers parts as Han and Chewie are brought into\nthe throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.\n\nLUKE\nHan!\n\nHAN\nLuke!\n\nLUKE\nAre you all right?\n\nHAN\nFine. Together again, huh?\n\nLUKE\nWouldn't miss it.\n\nHAN\nHow are we doing?\n\nLUKE\nThe same as always.\n\nHAN\nThat bad, huh? Where's Leia?\n\nLuke looks to Leia.\n\nLEIA\nI'm here.\n\nThreepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes Leia\nlike a pet cat. Several of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from\nthe other side of the room. Boba is standing behind Jabba.\n\nThreepio steps forward and translates for the captives.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed\nthat you are to be terminated immediately.\n\nHAN\nGood, I hate long waits.\n\nTHREEPIO\nYou will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of\nCarkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.\n\nHAN\t (to Luke)\nDoesn't sound so bad.\n\nTHREEPIO\nIn his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as\nyou are slowly digested over a thousand years.\n\nHAN\nOn second thought, let's pass on that, huh?\n\nChewie barks his agreement.\n\nLUKE\nYou should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever\nmake.\n\nJabba cackles evilly at this.\n\nAs the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer\nrises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned looks, but\nLuke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.\n\n23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF\n\nJabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by\ntwo smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke,\nHan, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is\nLando in disguise.\n\nHAN\nI think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a\nbig light blur.\n\nLUKE\nThere's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.\n\nHAN\nYou're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.\n\nLUKE\nJust stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.\n\nHAN\nOh... great!\n\n24   INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\n\nJabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His\nentire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time.\nLeia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to\nher neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to\nhim.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nSoon you will learn to appreciate me.\n\nThreepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller\ndroid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby\ndroid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?\n\nArtoo beeps a quick reply.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWell, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous.\nThey're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!\n\nArtoo whistles a singsong response.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHmm.  I wish I had your confidence.\n\n25   EXT SARLACC PIT\n\nThe convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one\nside of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's\nskiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of\nthe deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by\nthousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is the SARLACC. A plank is\nextended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's\nbonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth.\n\n26   EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\n\nJabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward\nand the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps\nup to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of\nintergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across\nloudspeakers.\n\nTHREEPIO\nVictims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die\nhonorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba\nthe Hutt will now listen to your pleas.\n\n27   EXT SKIFF\n\nHan steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak.\n\nHAN\nThreepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get\nno such pleasure from us. Right?\n\nChewie growls his agreement.\n\nLUKE\nJabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.\n\nLando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look\nof conspiracy to him.\n\n28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\n\nThe assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips\nunnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as\nhe speaks into the comlink.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nMove him into position.\n\nJabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.\n\n29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK\n\nArtoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit.\nBelow, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the\nplank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a\njaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap\nopens in Artoo's domed head.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nPut him in.\n\n30   EXT SKIFF - PLANK\n\nLuke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the\nbloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is\nhappening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his\nfingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him\nskyward. In midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of\nthe plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. He\ncasually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has\nsent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.\n\nWith samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded\nhim off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The\nother guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber\nflashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.\n\n31   EXT SARLACC PIT\n\nA bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and\nbegins sliding. He claws desperately as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs him\nand pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth.\n\n32   INT SAIL BARGE\n\nJabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the\nguards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy creatures\nwatching the action from the window are in an uproar.\n\n33   EXT SKIFF\n\nLuke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of\nthe Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie's bonds.\n\nLUKE\nEasy, Chewie.\n\nAt that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts\nfrom a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from the deck of\nthe rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately\nabove the Sarlacc pit.\n\nLANDO\nWhoa! Whoa! Help!\n\n34   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE\n\nWith two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his rocket\npack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to the skiff.\n\n35   EXT SKIFF\n\nBoba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke, who\nhas freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba can fire,\nthe young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty\nhunter's gun in half.\n\nImmediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck\ngun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown against the\nrail.\n\nHAN\nChewie, you okay? Where is he?\n\nThe Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.\n\nHAN\nI'm okay, pal.\n\nFor a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a\ncable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong\ncable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from\nthe wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight\nup to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable\nand stands free.\n\nAnother blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is\nknocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.\n\nLANDO\nHan! Chewie?\n\nHAN\nLando!\n\nLuke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets\nhim. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves\nin on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young\nJedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating\nthe guards from their midst.\n\nChewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han,\nguiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards.\nHan searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold\nof the spear.\n\nBoba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the\nother skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his\narm, and aims his lethal appendage.\n\nChewie barks desperately at Han.\n\nHAN\nBoba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?\n\nThe space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand\nwhacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.\n\nThe impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts\noff, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the\nside of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams\nas his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into\nthe mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a\nweak congratulations to Han.\n\n36   INT SAIL BARGE\n\nLeia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and\nthrows the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous\nneck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the\nchain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath\nthe tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his\nscum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted Hutt's huge tail spasms\nthrough its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. Leia\nstruggles to free herself of her bondage.\n\n37   EXT SKIFF\n\nLuke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han\nextends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling precariously\nfrom a rope on the prisoner's skiff.\n\nHAN\nLando, grab it!\n\nLANDO\nLower it!\n\nHAN\nI'm trying!\n\nA major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han\nand almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks,\nand Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot\ncatches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit.\nThe wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit\nfrom the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.\n\nHAN\nWhoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.\n\nChewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han\nextends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the\npit.\n\nHAN\nGrab it! L--Lando. Grab!\n\nLuke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck\ngun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the\nskiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail\nBarge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up\nthe hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his\nhead. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks\nthe helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.\n\nThe injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who\nis in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron\nhas stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by\nlying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand\nmoves him closer to his final reward.\n\nHAN\nGrab it! Almost... You almost got it!\n\nAnother blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let\ngo of the spear.\n\nLANDO\nHold it! Whoa!\n\nAgain Han extends the spear toward Lando.\n\nHAN\nGently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.\n\nLando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly\naround his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.\n\nHAN\nChewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.\n\nLANDO\nNo, wait! I thought you were blind!\n\nHAN\nIt's all right. Trust me. Don't move.\n\nLANDO\nAll right! A little higher! Just a little higher!\n\nHan adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate\nfires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases Lando, and\nChewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.\n\nHAN\nChewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!\n\n38   EXT UPPER DECK\n\nThe deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in\ntheir gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention:\nLuke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber.\nThe deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young\nJedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns to see two more\ngunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge)\nracing for him, firing their laser pistols.\n\n39   INT SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECK\n\nLeia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo zips\nthrough the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby\nlittle droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart.\n\nLEIA\nCome on. We gotta get out of here quick.\n\nArtoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is kicking and\nscreaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out\none of the golden droid's eyes.\n\nTHREEPIO\nNot my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!\n\nArtoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream,\ncrashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye\ndangling from a wire) hurry off.\n\n40   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE\n\nLuke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by\nguards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke\nturns to face another guard.\n\nLUKE\t (to Leia)\nGet the gun! Point it at the deck!\n\nLeia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels\nthe gun around.\n\nLUKE\nPoint it at the deck!\n\nA laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain,\nbut manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the\nguards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He\nflexes the hand; it still works.\n\nNear the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves\nas Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.\n\nArtoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself,\ntumbling toward the sand.\n\nLuke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she\nhas brought around to point down at the deck.\n\nLUKE\nCome on!\n\nLuke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers\nLeia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun\nexplodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.\n\n41   EXT SKIFF\n\nHan leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the deck.\nLuke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.\n\nLUKE\nLet's go! And don't forget the droids.\n\nLANDO\nWe're on our way.\n\nThe Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of the huge\ncraft is on fire.\n\n42   EXT SAND DUNE\n\nThreepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next\nto it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand. The skiff\nfloats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire.\nWith a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled\nfrom the sand.\n\n43   EXT DUNE SEA\n\nThe little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which continues\nits chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across the desert, the\nbarge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration.\n\n44   EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA\n\nA ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR\nTHE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand,\npressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and Threepio, followed\nby Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come into view, each\nsupporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his\nwound.\n\nSoon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It\nis the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing\nand a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard.\n\nHAN\nI don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!\n\nLEIA\nThat's all any of us can see.\n\nHAN\t (blinking)\nThen I guess I'm getting better.\n\nAs soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the wind\ndies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition.\nThreepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a HUM.\n\nHAN \t(turning to Luke)\nI've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.\n\nLUKE\t (shrugging it off)\nI had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.\n\nHAN\nNo, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest\nthing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide\nawake nothing!\n\nLuke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi warrior,\nmussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him.\n\nLUKE \t(moving to his ship)\nI'll see you back at the fleet.\n\nHAN\nWhy don't you leave that crate and come with us?\n\nLUKE\nI have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.\n\nLuke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft.\n\nHAN\n(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's\nbetrayal and subsequent aide)\nGuess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.\n\nLANDO\nFigured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the\nrest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.\n\nLEIA\nHe means \"You're welcome.\"\n\nLANDO\nCome on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.\n\n44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE\n\nThe desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing appears and\npeels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON appears as a dot and\ngrows huge, to roar directly over the CAMERA.\n\n45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT\n\nLuke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside the\ncanopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the MILLENNIUM\nFALCON.\n\nLUKE\nI'll meet you back at the fleet.\n\nLEIA\t (over comlink)\nHurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.\n\nLUKE\nI will.\n\nHAN\t (over comlink)\nHey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.\n\nA message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of\nLuke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he pulls a black\nglove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.\n\nLUKE\nThat's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a\npromise to keep... to an old friend.\n\n46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR\n\nA Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet rest in\nspace above the half-completed Death Star and its green neighbor,\nEndor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial shuttle toward\nthe Death Star.\n\n47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY\n\nLord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous\nDeath Star commander.\n\n48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR\n\nThousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth\ndocking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where\nthe shuttle is coming to rest.\n\nThe shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out and\ncreate a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid attention\nwith a momentous SNAP.\n\nThen, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a\nrather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way\ndown the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak\nsimilar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's\nface is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow\neyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme\nRuler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord.\n\nEMPEROR\t (to Vader)\nRise, my friend.\n\nVader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes his way\nalong the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other commanders stay\nkneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader, followed by several\nImperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the\nprocession.\n\nVADER\nThe Death Star will be completed on schedule.\n\nEMPEROR\nYou have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue\nyour search for young Skywalker.\n\nVADER\nYes, my Master.\n\nEMPEROR\nPatience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does,\nyou must bring him\nbefore me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the\ndark side of the\nForce.\n\nVADER\nAs you wish.\n\nEMPEROR\nEverything is proceeding as I have foreseen.\n\nHe laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial\ntroops.\n\n49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH\n\nOnce again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of\nthe swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps\ndisconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm\nyellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom.\n\n50   INT YODA'S HOUSE\n\nThe tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of\nthe cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that\nclutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER.\nHis manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.\n\nYODA\nHmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?\n\nLuke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look\nhas been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.\n\nLUKE\nNo... of course not.\n\nYODA\t (tickled, chuckles)\nI do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak.\n(Points a crooked finger)\nWhen nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?\n\nYoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.\n\nYODA\nSoon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.\n\nYoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.\n\nLUKE\nMaster Yoda, you can't die.\n\nYODA\nStrong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me\nand soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the\nForce.\n\nLUKE\nBut I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.\n\nYODA\nNo more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.\n\nYoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.\n\nLUKE\nThen I am a Jedi?\n\nYODA\t (shakes his head)\nOhhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then,\nonly then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.\n\nLuke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his\ncourage. Finally he is able to ask.\n\nLUKE\nMaster Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?\n\nYoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile\ncreases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from Luke.\n\nYODA\nMmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.\n\nLuke watches him, each moment an eternity.\n\nLUKE\nYoda, I must know.\n\nYODA\nYour father he is.\n\nLuke reacts as if cut.\n\nYODA\nTold you, did he?\n\nLUKE\nYes.\n\nA new look of concern crosses Yoda's face.  He closes his eyes.\n\nYODA\nUnexpected this is, and unfortunate...\n\nLUKE\nUnfortunate that I know the truth?\n\nYoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.\n\nYODA\t\t (gathering all his strength)\nNo. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your\ntraining. Not\nready for the burden were you.\n\nLUKE\nWell, I'm sorry.\n\nYODA\nRemember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger,\nfear, aggression.\nThe dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever\nwill it dominate your\ndestiny.\n\nHe beckons the young Jedi closer to him.\n\nYODA\nLuke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor,\nor suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I\n(cough),\nthe last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your\nfamily. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...\n(with great effort)\nThere is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.\n\nHe catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green\ncreature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he disappears\nin front of his eyes.\n\n51   EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING\n\nLuke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a greeting,\nbut is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to\nhelp Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly.\n\nLUKE\nI can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.\n\nBEN\t (OS)\nYoda will always be with you.\n\nLuke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.\n\nLUKE\nObi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?\n\nThe ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.\n\nLUKE\nYou told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.\n\nBEN\nYou father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be\nAnakin Skywalker\nand became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your\nfather was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a\ncertain point of view.\n\nLUKE\t (turning away, derisive)\nA certain point of view!\n\nBEN\nLuke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend\ngreatly on our own\npoint of view.\n\nLuke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.\n\nBEN\nI don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it\ncertainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened\nto your father was my fault.\n\nBen pauses sadly.\n\nBEN\nAnakin was a good friend.\n\nLuke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a\nstump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence.\n\nBEN\nWhen I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was\namazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to\ntrain him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well\nas Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the\ngalaxy.\n\nLuke is entranced.\n\nLUKE\nThere's still good in him.\n\nBEN\nI also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be\ndone. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.\n\nLUKE\nI can't do it, Ben.\n\nBEN\nYou cannot escape your destiny.\n\nLUKE\nI tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.\n\nBEN\nVader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience\nwas part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value\nof patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you\ncould have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been\nprepared.\n\nLUKE\nBut I had to help my friends.\n\nBEN\t (grinning at Luke's indignation)\nAnd did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved\nlittle by rushing back prematurely, I fear.\n\nLUKE\t (with sadness)\nI found out Darth Vader was my father.\n\nBEN\nTo be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side\n- the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest\ndoor - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what\nhe found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're\nno longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now,\nyou must face Darth Vader again!\n\nLUKE\nI can't kill my own father.\n\nBEN\nThen the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.\n\nLUKE\nYoda spoke of another.\n\nBEN\nThe other he spoke of is your twin sister.\n\nLUKE\nBut I have no sister.\n\nBEN\nHmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your\nfather when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were\nto have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the\nreason why your sister remains safely anonymous.\n\nLUKE\nLeia! Leia's my sister.\n\nBEN\nYour insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They\ndo you credit.\nBut they could be made to serve the Emperor.\n\nLuke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.\n\nBEN\t (continuing his narrative)\nWhen your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your\nmother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep\nyou both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you\nto live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia\nto live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.\n\nLuke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.\n\nBEN\t (attempting to give solace with his words)\nThe Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in\nthat system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew\nshe'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power,\nsince Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family\ncontinued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster\nfather's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of\ncourse... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the\ncorrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a\nvital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she\nwas doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had\nalways told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became\ndesperate.\n\nLuke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his\nsister.\n\nLUKE\nBut you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.\n\nBEN\nShe hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have,\nLuke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your\nfamily. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy\nVader!\n\n52   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET\n\nThe vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. Overhead a\ndozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation. Fighters and\nbattlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel Star Cruisers, the\nHEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.\n\n53   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM\n\nHundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in\nthe WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a\nholographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the\nnearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield.\n\nMON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a stern\nbut beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several\nmilitary leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a\nsalmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the crowd until he\nfinds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids.\n\nHan peers at Lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused.\n\nHAN\nWell, look at you, a general, huh?\n\nLANDO\nOh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the\nbattle of Taanab.\n\nHAN\t (sarcastic)\nWell, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I\ndidn't know they were\nlookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.\n\nLANDO\t (smiling)\nI'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.\n\nHAN\nWell, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable\none, remember?\n\nMon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.\n\nMON MOTHMA\nThe Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has\ncome.\n\nThis causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of the\nDeath Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the\ncenter of the room.\n\nMON MOTHMA\nThe data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location\nof the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon\nsystems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial\nFleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is\nrelatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that\nthe Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the\nconstruction of this Death Star.\n\nA volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns to Leia\nas Chewie barks his amazement.\n\nMON MOTHMA\t (cont)\nMany Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.\n\nAdmiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's force field\nand the Moon of Endor.\n\nACKBAR\nYou can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor.\nAlthough the weapon\nsystems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does\nhave a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield,\nwhich is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield\nmust be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield\nis down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly\ninto the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.\n\nThere's a concerned murmur.\n\nACKBAR\t (cont)\nGeneral Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack\n\nHan turns to Lando with a look of respect.\n\nHAN\nGood luck.\n\nLando nods his thanks.\n\nHAN\nYou're gonna need it.\n\nACKBAR\nGeneral Madine.\n\nMadine moves center stage.\n\nGENERAL MADINE\nWe have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and\nusing a secret\nImperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the\nshield generator.\n\nThe assembly begins to mumble among themselves.\n\nTHREEPIO\nSounds dangerous.\n\nLEIA\t (to Han)\nI wonder who they found to pull that off.\n\nGENERAL MADINE\nGeneral Solo, is your strike team assembled?\n\nLeia, startled, looks up at Han, surprise changing to admiration.\n\nHAN\nUh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.\n\nChewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers.  Han looks up at him.\n\nHAN\nWell, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.\n\nChewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.\n\nHAN\t (smiles)\nThat's one.\n\nLEIA\nUh, General... count me in.\n\nVOICE\t (OS)\nI'm with you, too!\n\nThey turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are more\ncheers. The commanders part, and there at the back stands Luke. Han and\nLeia are surprised and delighted.\n\nLeia moves to Luke and embraces him warmly. She senses a change in him\nand looks into his eyes questioningly.\n\nLEIA\nWhat is it?\n\nLUKE\t (hesitant)\nAsk me again sometime.\n\nHan, Chewie, and Lando crowd around Luke as the assembly breaks up.\n\nHAN\nLuke.\n\nLUKE\nHi, Han... Chewie.\n\nArtoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried Threepio.\n\nTHREEPIO\n\"Exciting\" is hardly the word I would use.\n\n54   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN DOCKING BAY\n\nThe Millennium Falcon rests beyond the stolen IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, which\nlooks anomalous among all the Rebel ships in the vast docking bay.\nChewie barks a final farewell to Lando and leads Artoo and Threepio up\nthe shuttle, crowded now with the Rebel strike team loading weapons and\nsupplies. Lando turns to face Han. Luke and Leia have said their good-\nbyes and start up the ramp.\n\nHAN\nLook. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the\nhelp you can get. She's\nthe fastest ship in the fleet.\n\nLANDO\nAll right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take\ngood care of her.\nShe-she won't get a scratch. All right?\n\nHAN\t (looks at him warmly)\nRight. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.\n\nLANDO\nLook, would you get going, you pirate.\n\nHan and Lando pause, then exchange salutes.\n\nLANDO\nGood luck.\n\nHAN\nYou, too.\n\nHan goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns away.\n\n55   INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT\n\nLuke is working on a back control panel as Han comes in and takes the\npilot's seat. Chewie, in the seat next to him, is trying to figure out\nall the Imperial controls.\n\nHAN\nYou got her warmed?\n\nLUKE\nYeah, she's comin' up.\n\nChewie growls a complaint.\n\nHAN\nNo. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed\nher, Chewie.\n\nLeia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near Luke.\n\nChewie barks and hits some switches. Han's glance has stuck on\nsomething out the window: the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him\ngently.\n\nLEIA\nHey, are you awake?\n\nHAN\nYeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.\n\nChewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the\nFalcon, too. Leia puts a hand on Han's shoulder.\n\nLEIA\t (softly)\nCome on, General, let's move.\n\nHan snaps back to life.\n\nHAN\nRight. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready,\neverybody?\n\nLUKE\nAll set.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHere we go again.\n\nHAN\nAll right, hang on.\n\n56   EXT SPACE - THE REBEL FLEET\n\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the\nHeadquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and zooms\noff into space.\n\n57   INT EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM\n\nThe converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of light at\nthe far end. There the Emperor sits in an elaborate control chair\nbefore a large window which looks out across the half-completed Death\nStar to the giant green moon of Endor.\n\nDarth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council,\ncautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader. After\nseveral tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around to face him.\n\nVADER\nWhat is thy bidding, my Master?\n\nEMPEROR\nSend the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until\ncalled for.\n\nVADER\nWhat of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?\n\nEMPEROR\nIt is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young\nSkywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go\nout to the command ship and await my orders.\n\nVADER\nYes, my Master.\n\nVader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the Emperor walks\ntoward the waiting council members.\n\n58   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR - MOON\n\nThere is a great deal of Imperial traffic in the area as construction\nproceeds on the Death Star. Transports, TIE fighters, and a few Star\nDestroyers move about. Now the huge Super Star Destroyer announces\nitself with a low roar and soon fills the frame.\n\n59   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT\n\nHan looks back at Luke and Leia as Chewie flips several switches.\nThrough the viewscreen, the Death Star and the huge Super Star\nDestroyer can be seen.\n\nHAN\nIf they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty\nquick, Chewie.\n\nChewie growls his agreement.\n\nCONTROLLER\t (over radio)\nWe have you on our screen now. Please identify.\n\nHAN\nShuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.\n\nCONTROLLER\t (over radio)\nShuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.\n\nHAN\nTransmission commencing.\n\nLeia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed\ntransmission begins.\n\nLEIA\nNow we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.\n\nHAN\nIt'll work. It'll work.\n\nChewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star Destroyer\nthat looms ever larger before them.\n\nLUKE\nVader's on that ship.\n\nHAN\nNow don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep\nyour distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep\nyour distance.\n\nChewie barks a question.\n\nHAN\nI don't know.  Fly casual.\n\nLUKE\nI'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.\n\nHAN\nIt's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.\n\nChewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger out\nthe window.\n\n60   INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\n\nLord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death Star.\nNow, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. After a moment\nof stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where ADMIRAL\nPIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen\nearlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach.\n\nVADER\nWhere is that shuttle going?\n\nPIETT\t (into comlink)\nShuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?\n\nPILOT VOICE    (HAN)   (filtered)\nParts and technical crew for the forest moon.\n\nThe Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.\n\nVADER\nDo they have a code clearance?\n\nPIETT\nIt's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.\n\nVader looks upward, as he senses Luke's presence.\n\nPIETT\nShall I hold them?\n\nVADER\nNo. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.\n\nPIETT\t (surprised)\nAs you wish, my lord.\n(to controller)\nCarry on.\n\nPiett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.\n\n61   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT\n\nThe group waits tensely.\n\nHAN\nThey're not goin' for it, Chewie.\n\nCONTROLLER\t (filtered)\nShuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately.\nFollow your\npresent course.\n\nEveryone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who looks\nworried. Chewie barks.\n\nHAN\nOkay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.\n\n62   EXT SPACE - STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - ENDOR\n\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle moves off toward the green Sanctuary Moon.\n\n63   EXT FOREST LANDING SITE - ENDOR\n\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark,\nprimeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.\n\nOn an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a\nsteep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and Luke. The\ntroops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and Threepio\nbringing up the rear. Artoo beeps.\n\nUp ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly\nto the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. Han and Luke\ncrawl up to take a look.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, I told you it was dangerous here.\n\nTHEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering\nthrough bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked\nnearby.\n\nLEIA\nShall we try and go around?\n\nHAN\nIt'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.\n\nLeia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Chewie\nstart quietly down.\n\n64   EXT FOREST CLEARING - CAMPSITE\n\nThe four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far\nfrom the two Imperial scouts.\n\nHAN\nChewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.\n\nLUKE\nQuietly, there might be more of them out there.\n\nHAN\t (grins)\nHey... it's me.\n\nHan and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts.\nLuke and Leia exchange smiles.\n\nHan sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout\nwhirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion.\n\nSCOUT #1\nGo for help! Go!\n\nThe second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but Chewie\ngets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to\ncrash into a tree. Han and Scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight.\n\nLUKE\t (sarcastic)\nGreat. Come on.\n\nLuke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser pistol\ndrawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and points to where\ntwo more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied\nbike parked nearby.\n\nLEIA\nOver there! Two more of them!\n\nLUKE\nI see them. Wait, Leia!\n\nBut Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She\nstarts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her.\n\nLUKE\t (pointing to the controls)\nQuick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!\n\nLuke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely\navoiding two huge trees.\n\nHAN\nHey, wait! Ahhh!\n\nHe flips the remaining scout to the ground.\n\n65   EXT FOREST - THE BIKE CHASE\n\nThe two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia\npursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from\ntheir bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets.\n\nLUKE\nMove closer!\n\nLeia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer\nthrough a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree,\nslowing the scout.\n\nLUKE\nGet alongside that one!\n\nLeia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their\nsteering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of\nthe scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him\noff the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike\nand follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the\nremaining scout.\n\nLUKE\nGet him!\n\nThe speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing\ninto pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser\ncannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a\nglancing hit.\n\nLUKE\t (indicating the one ahead)\nKeep on that one! I'll take these two!\n\nWith Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into\nthe braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as\nthey zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and\nstarts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a\nmanner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted\nout of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.\n\nThe scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into\nturbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.\n\nFAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom\nthrough the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and\nrises out of sight.\n\nThe scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia\ndives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes\na glancing hit.\n\nLeia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches\ndown, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has\nblasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike\nexplodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion.\nBut when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a\ngiant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a\nconflagration.\n\nANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue\ntheir weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The\nscout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a\nbridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top\nand crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a\nwide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside\nhim makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all\nhis might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able\nto make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the\nscout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are\nmoving as one.\n\nAnother big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and\ndives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's\nexplodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find\nLuke.\n\nLuke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and\nopens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and\nbegins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it\nappears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant,\nLuke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty\nslash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling,\nit rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.\n\n66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST\n\nHan, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait\nanxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed\nhead and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!\n\nHan, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.\n\nLuke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's\ntoo tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.\n\nHAN\nLuke! Where's Leia?\n\nLUKE\t (concerned)\nWhat? She didn't come back?\n\nHAN\nI thought she was with you.\n\nLUKE\nWe got separated.\n\nLuke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.\n\nLUKE\nHey, we better go look for her.\n\nHan nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.\n\nHAN\nTake the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.\n\nLUKE\nCome on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.\n\nLuke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the\nsquad proceeds in another.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDon't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.\n\nThey move off into the woods.\n\nTHREEPIO\t (to Artoo)\nAnd you said it was pretty here. Ugh!\n\n67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE\n\nA strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into\nview. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat\npuzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this\nfrightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up\nand stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where\nshe is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and\ndisheveled.\n\nThe Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a\ndefensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins\npoking her with the sharp point of the spear.\n\nLEIA\nCut it out!\n\nShe stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.\n\nLEIA\nI'm not gonna hurt you.\n\nLeia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of\nher speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log.\n\nLEIA\nWell, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here\nis.\n\nShe puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from\nher fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log\nbeside her.\n\nLEIA\nWell, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.\n\nWicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia\npats the log again.\n\nLEIA\nI promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.\n\nMore growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.\n\nLEIA\nAll right. You want something to eat?\n\nShe takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him.\nWicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously\ntoward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.\n\nLEIA\nThat's right. Come on. Hmmm?\n\nSniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the\nlog beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps\nback, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her\nand chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.\n\nLEIA\nLook, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery\nlittle thing, aren't you?\n\nReassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming\nto investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to\nsniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning\nto Leia.\n\nLEIA\nWhat is it?\n\nSuddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log\nnext to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding\nbehind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears\nunderneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the\nforest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL\nSCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches\nout his hand for her weapon.\n\nSCOUT #l\nFreeze!  Come on, get up!\n\nShe hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage\nin front of the log.\n\nSCOUT #1\nGo get your ride and take her back to base.\n\nSCOUT #2\nYes, sir.\n\nThe second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the\nlog, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout\njumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled.\nLeia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol,\nand the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and\nhits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's\nbike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once\nmore. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards\nLeia with\u00canew respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking\naround all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the\ndense foliage.\n\nLEIA\nCome on, let's get outta here.\n\nAs they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and\ntugs at Leia to follow him.\n\n68   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR'S TOWER\n\nDarth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor's Tower and private\nelevator. The Emperor's private guard steps in Vader's path.\n\nGUARD\nHalt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.\n\nVADER\n(raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the\nForce)\nThe Emperor will see me, now!\n\nGUARD\n(repeating Vader's command)\nThe Emperor will see you, now.\n\n69   INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\n\nTwo red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens\nto reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. It\nappears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. He\nwaits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his back to the Dark\nLord.\n\nEMPEROR\nI told you to remain on the command ship.\n\nVADER\nA small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.\n\nEMPEROR\t (no surprise)\nYes, I know.\n\nVADER\t (after a beat)\nMy son is with them.\n\nEMPEROR\t (very cool)\nAre you sure?\n\nVADER\nI have felt him, my Master.\n\nEMPEROR\nStrange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are\nclear, Lord\nVader.\n\nVader knows what is being asked.\n\nVADER\nThey are clear, my Master.\n\nEMPEROR\nThen you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.\n\nVADER\t (skeptical)\nHe will come to me?\n\nEMPEROR\nI have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will\ncome to you and\nthen you will bring him before me.\n\nVADER\t (bows)\nAs you wish.\n\nThe Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.\n\n70   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE\n\nHan, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move\nthrough the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw Leia.\nLuke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern.\n\nHAN\t (OS)\nLuke! Luke!\n\nLuke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred wreckage\nof a speeder bike in the grass.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, Master Luke.\n\nLUKE\nThere's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.\n\nHe tosses the helmet to Han.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.\n\nHAN\t (gravely)\nI hope she's alright.\n\nChewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off\nthrough the foliage.\n\nHAN\nWhat, Chewie? What? Chewie!\n\nThe others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots along,\nArtoo whistles nervously.\n\n71   EXT FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGE\n\nThe group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up to a\ntall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal hanging from\nit.\n\nHAN\nHey, I don't get it.\n\nThe rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake.\n\nHAN\t (cont)\nNah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.\n\nChewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat.\n\nLUKE\nChewie, wa-wait!  Don't!\n\nToo late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake.\nSPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net,\nsuspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a wild series of\nbeeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a\njumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his mouth.\n\nHAN\nNice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.\n\nLUKE\nWill you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this\nthing.\n(trying to free an arm)\nHan, can you reach my lightsaber?\n\nHAN\nYeah, sure.\n\nArtoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his cutting\nappendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to squeeze an\narm past Threepio to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to\nspin.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-\nop!!\n\nArtoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net,\ncrashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they\nrealize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long\nspear.\n\nHAN\nWha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.\n\nHan pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a second Ewok\nwarrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear returns to Han's face.\nHe grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol.\n\nHAN\nHey!\n\nLUKE\nHan, don't. It'll be all right.\n\nThe Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke lets\nthem take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry critters.\n\nLUKE\nChewie, give 'em your crossbow.\n\nArtoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets free\nof the net and sits up, rattled.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, my head. Oh, my goodness!\n\nWhen the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among\nthemselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok\nnearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In\na moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled\nbark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks\nbegin to chant at Threepio.\n\nLUKE\nDo you understand anything they're saying?\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million\nforms of\ncommunication.\n\nHAN\nWhat are you telling them?\n\nTHREEPIO\nHello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive\ndialect.  But\nI do believe they think I am some sort of god.\n\nChewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke exchange\n\"what next?\" looks.\n\nHAN\nWell, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?\n\nTHREEPIO\nI beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.\n\nHAN\nProper?!\n\nTHREEPIO\nIt's against my programming to impersonate a deity.\n\nHan moves toward Threepio threateningly.\n\nHAN\nWhy, you--\n\nSeveral Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face at the affront to their\ngod. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and Han is surrounded by a\nmenacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He holds up his hands\nplacatingly.\n\nHAN\nMy mistake. He's an old friend of mine.\n\n72   EXT FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS\n\nA procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. Their\nprisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to long poles and\nwrapped in vines, cocoonlike.\n\nEach pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind the\ncaptives, Threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by the\nremaining creatures.\n\n73   EXT FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FOREST\n\nThe procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the\ngiant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into\nnothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts\nand rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. The lead Ewok takes\nhold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other\nEwoks follow suit.\n\n74   EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE\n\nThe procession winds its way into the village square. Mother Ewoks\ngather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the\nnewcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.\n\nHan, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to their poles. Han is\nplaced on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others\nare leaned against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne is gently\nplaced near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination. Han, Luke, and\nChewie are less than fascinated.\n\nHAN\nI have a really bad feeling about this.\n\nChewie growls his concern.\n\nSuddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes\nout of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join\nThreepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A\nlarger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber\nwith great curiosity.\n\nLogray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing\nto the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit\nunder Han with firewood.\n\nHAN\nWhat did he say?\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the\nmain course at a\nbanquet in my honor.\n\nThe drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut.\nLeia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening\nat the same moment the prisoners see her.\n\nHAN and LUKE\nLeia!\n\nAs she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears.\n\nLEIA\nOh!\n\nTHREEPIO\nYour Royal Highness.\n\nArtoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the\nassembled Ewoks and sighs.\n\nLEIA\nBut these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.\n\nThreepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads\nnegatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners and barks\nsome orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue\nwith vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke and Han .\n\nHAN\nSomehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.\n\nLUKE\nThreepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry\nand use your magic.\n\nTHREEPIO\nBut Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --\n\nLUKE\nJust tell them.\n\nThreepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps\nforward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and begins to\nconcentrate.\n\nTHREEPIO\nYou see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...\n\nNow the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the\nground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking.\n\nTHREEPIO\n... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear!\nOh!\n\nThe Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio\nbegins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio\ncalling out in total panic at his situation.\n\nTHREEPIO\nPut me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help!\nMaster Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!\n\nChief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and\nrelease the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group\nembrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at\nhim, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground.\nLogray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground.\nWhen the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo\nbeeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him,\nfinally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The\nEwok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group\nof Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and\nmarveling at his height.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.\n\nLUKE\nThanks, Threepio.\n\nTHREEPIO\t (still shaken)\nI...I never knew I had it in me.\n\n75   INT CHIEF'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERS\n\nA glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room,\ncreating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one side, a\ngroup of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne.\nThe Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with Threepio between the\ntwo groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side.\n\nThreepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's\nsqueaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally\nmurmur comments to each other. Threepio points several times at the\nRebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War,\nmimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers.\nThroughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable\nin English: Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-\nWan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio.\n\nTHREEPIO\nYes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.\n\nThreepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han\nSolo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.\n\nAt the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in\nagreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.\n\nThe drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer\nand screeches.\n\nHAN\nWhat's going on?\n\nLEIA\nI don't know.\n\nLuke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now something\npasses like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The others do not\nnotice.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.\n\nSeveral of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.\n\nHAN\nJust what I always wanted.\n\nChewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket\nclings to Han's leg.\n\nHAN\t (chuckles)\nWell, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.\n(to Wicket)\nThank you. Okay.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield\ngenerator.\n\nChewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders\noutside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.\n\nHAN\nGood. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try\nand get our weapons back.\n\nHan pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.\n\nHAN\t (cont)\nAnd hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.\n\n76   EXT EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHT\n\nThe walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow and\nflicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill the soft\nnight air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut and stands\nstaring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like that.\n\nLEIA\nLuke, what's wrong?\n\nLuke turns and looks at her a long moment.\n\nLUKE\nLeia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?\n\nLEIA\nJust a little bit. She died when I was very young.\n\nLUKE\nWhat do you remember?\n\nLEIA\nJust...images, really. Feelings.\n\nLUKE\nTell me.\n\nLEIA\n(a little surprised at his insistence)\nShe was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.\n(looks up)\nWhy are you asking me all this?\n\nHe looks away.\n\nLUKE\nI have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.\n\nLEIA\nLuke, tell me. What's troubling you?\n\nLUKE\nVader is here...now, on this moon.\n\nLEIA\t (alarmed)\nHow do you know?\n\nLUKE\nI felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near.\nThat's why I have to go.\n(facing her)\nAs long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.\n(beat)\nI have to face him.\n\nLeia is distraught, confused.\n\nLEIA\nWhy?\n\nLuke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.\n\nLUKE\nHe's my father.\n\nLEIA\nYour father?\n\nLUKE\nThere's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I\ndon't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.\n\nLeia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.\n\nLEIA\nLuke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and\ncould never have.\n\nLUKE\nYou're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to\nuse it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has\nit...I have it...and...my sister has it.\n\nLeia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she\ndoesn't draw away. She begins to understand.\n\nLUKE\nYes. It's you Leia.\n\nLEIA\nI know. Somehow...I've always known.\n\nLUKE\nThen you know why I have to face him.\n\nLEIA\nNo! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave\nthis place. I wish I could go with you.\n\nLUKE\nNo, you don't. You've always been strong.\n\nLEIA\nBut, why must you confront him?\n\nLUKE\nBecause...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to\nthe Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I\nhave to try.\n\nThey hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.\n\nLeia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He\ndisappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed\nin moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and\ncomes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only\nnow that she is crying.\n\nHAN\nHey, what's goin' on?\n\nLeia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.\n\nLEIA\nNothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.\n\nHAN\t (angry)\nNothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?\n\nShe looks up at him, struggling to control herself.\n\nLEIA\nI...I can't tell you.\n\nHAN\t (loses his temper)\nDid you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?\n\nLEIA\nI...\n\nHAN\nAhhh...\n\nHe starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.\n\nHAN\nI'm sorry.\n\nLEIA\nHold me.\n\nHan gathers her tightly in his protective embrace.\n\n77   EXT FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM\n\nAn Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands\ngracefully on the huge platform.\n\nNow, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of\nthe forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks\nparticularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.\n\n78   EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK\n\nDarth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into\nan elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He walks toward\nanother ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with Luke,\nin binders, at their center. The young Jedi gazes at Vader with\ncomplete calm.\n\nCOMMANDER\nThis is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I\nbelieve there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct\na further search of the area.\n\nThe commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.\n\nCOMMANDER\nHe was armed only with this.\n\nVader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking the\nlightsaber from the commander's hand.\n\nVADER\nGood work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his\ncompanions to me.\n\nCOMMANDER\nYes, my Lord.\n\nThe officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing alone\nin the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of the forest\nfilter in upon them.\n\nVADER\nThe Emperor has been expecting you.\n\nLUKE\nI know, father.\n\nVADER\nSo, you have accepted the truth.\n\nLURE\nI've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.\n\nVADER\t (turning to face him)\nThat name no longer has any meaning for me.\n\nLUKE\nIt is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there\nis good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is\nwhy you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your\nEmperor now.\n\nVader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved\nhand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.\n\nVADER\t (indicating lightsaber)\nI see you have constructed a new lightsaber.\n\nVader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming,\nbrilliant blade.\n\nVADER\nYour skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has\nforeseen.\n\nThey stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.\n\nLUKE\nCome with me.\n\nVADER\nObi-Wan once thought as you do.\n\nLuke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.\n\nVADER\nYou don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.\n\nLUKE\nI will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.\n\nVADER\nIf that is your destiny.\n\nLUKE\nSearch your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict\nwithin you. Let go\nof your hate.\n\nVADER\nIt is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature\nof the Force. He is\nyour master now.\n\nVader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand staring\nat one another for a long moment.\n\nLUKE\nThen my father is truly dead.\n\n79   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING SHIELD GENERATOR\n\nHan, Leia, Chewbacca, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout,\nPAPLOO, hide on a ridge overlooking the massive Imperial shield\ngenerator. At the base of the generator is an Imperial landing\nplatform. Leia studies the installation.\n\nLEIA\nThe main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that\nlanding platform. This\nisn't gonna be easy.\n\nHAN\nHey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily\nguarded than this.\n\nWicket and Paploo are chattering away in Ewok language. They speak to\nThreepio.\n\nLEIA\nWhat's he saying?\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.\n\n80   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET\n\nThe vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet. A giant Rebel Star\nCruiser is up at the front, but now the Millennium Flacon roars up to a\nspot ahead of it, tiny in comparison.\n\n81   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nLando is in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, NIEN NUNB, takes some\ngetting used to in the familiar environs of the Falcon's cockpit. Lando\nspeaks into his comlink.\n\nLANDO\nAdmiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.\n\nACKBAR \t(VO)\nProceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.\n\nLando turns to his weird copilot.\n\nLANDO\nDon't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down\non time...\n(to himself)\nor this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.\n\nThe copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment.\n\nACKBAR\t (VO)\nAll craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.\n\nLANDO\nAll right. Stand by.\n\nHe pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak.\n\n82   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET\n\nWe are treated to an awesome sight: first the Millennium Falcon, then\nAckbar's Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge fleet ROARS\nINTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears.\n\n83   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING CONTROL BUNKER\n\nHan, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket and\nPaploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire group is\nspread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the BUNKER that\nleads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes\nparked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. Chewie growls an\nobservation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in Ewok language.\n\nHAN\nBack door, huh? Good idea.\n\nWicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.\n\nHAN\t (cont)\nIt's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.\n\nLEIA\nWell, it only takes one to sound the alarm.\n\nHAN\t (with self-confident grin)\nThen we'll do it real quiet-like.\n\nThreepio explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The Ewoks\nchatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up and scampers\ninto the underbrush.\n\nThreepio asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short reply.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!\n\nLEIA\nQuiet.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.\n\nLEIA\nOh, no.\n\n84   EXT BUNKER - ENTRANCE\n\nPaploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial\nscouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body onto\none of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at\nrandom. Suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous ROAR.\nPaploo grins and continues flipping switches. The scouts leap up in\nsurprise.\n\n85   EXT RIDGE\n\nHan, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks.\n\nHAN \t(sighs)\nThere goes our surprise attack.\n\n86   EXT BUNKER\n\nThe Imperial scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms into\nmotion. Paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the forest.\n\nSCOUT\nLook! Over there! Stop him!\n\nThree of the Imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away\nin pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the door.\n\n87   EXT RIDGE\n\nHan, Leia, and Chewie exchange delighted looks.\n\nHAN\nNot bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here.\nWe'll take care of this.\n\nHan and the Wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the bunker.\nThreepio moves to stand next to Wicket and Artoo.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI have decided that we shall stay here.\n\n88   EXT FOREST\n\nPaploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It's scary,\nbut he loves it. When the Imperial scouts pull within sight behind him\nand begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. As he rounds\na tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the\ntrees. A moment later, the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the\nstill-flying, unoccupied bike.\n\n89   EXT BUNKER\n\nHan sneaks up behind the remaining Imperial scout, taps him on the\nshoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms\nof the waiting Rebel strike team. Han returns to the front, and taps\nout a pattern on the bunker door's control panel. Everyone stands out\nof sight, police-style, as the door opens. Han and Leia peek inside. No\nsign of life. The group enters the bunker silently, leaving one lookout\nbehind.\n\n90   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM\n\nThe elevator opens. Vader and Luke enter the room alone. They walk\nacross the dark space to stand before the throne, father and son side\nby side beneath the gaze of the Emperor. Vader bows to his Master.\n\nEMPEROR\nWelcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.\n\nLuke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks down\nat Luke's binders.\n\nEMPEROR\nYou no longer need those.\n\nThe Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke's binders\nfall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at his own hands,\nfree now to reach out and grab the Emperor's neck. He does nothing.\n\nEMPEROR\nGuards, leave us.\n\nThe red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.\n\nEMPEROR\t (to Luke)\nI'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call\nme Master.\n\nLUKE\nYou're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.\n\nThe Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to Luke.\nThe Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time, Luke can\nperceive the evil visage within the hood.\n\nEMPEROR\nOh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are\nmistaken...about a great many things.\n\nVADER\nHis lightsaber.\n\nVader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke's\nlightsaber. The Emperor takes it.\n\nEMPEROR\nAh, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know\nyour father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with\nyou.\n\nLUKE\nYou're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.\n\nThe Emperor laughs.\n\nEMPEROR\nPerhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.\n\nLuke looks up sharply.\n\nEMPEROR\nYes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.\n\nVader looks at Luke.\n\nLUKE\nYour overconfidence is your weakness.\n\nEMPEROR\nYour faith in your friends is yours.\n\nVADER\nIt is pointless to resist, my son.\n\nThe Emperor turns to face Luke.\n\nEMPEROR\t (angry)\nEverything that has transpired has done so according to my design.\n(indicates Endor)\nYour friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...\n\nLuke reacts. The Emperor notes it.\n\nEMPEROR\t (cont)\n...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who\nallowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It\nis quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my\nbest troops awaits them.\n\nLuke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the sword\nin the Emperor's hand.\n\nEMPEROR\nOh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when\nyour friends arrive.\n\n91   INT BUNKER - MAIN CONTROL ROOM\n\nHan, Leia, Chewie, and the Rebel strike team storm through a door and\nenter the main control room, taking all of the personnel prisoner.\n\nHAN\nAll right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.\n\nThe Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels.\nLeia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.\n\nLEIA\nHan! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.\n\nHAN\nCharges!  Come on, come on!\n\nOutside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more\ncontrollers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at\nthe door.\n\nTHREEPIO\t (to Wicket)\nOh, my! They'll be captured!\n\nWicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam into\nthe forest.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.\n\nInside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an Imperial\ncommander enters.\n\nCOMMANDER\nFreeze! You Rebel scum.\n\nHan and Leia spin, to find dozens of Imperial weapons trained on them\nand their cohorts. A poised force of Imperial troops surround them.\nEven more pour into the room, roughly disarming the Rebel contingent.\nHan, Leia, and Chewie exchange looks. They're helpless.\n\n92   EXT SPACE - ENDOR, DEATH STAR, REBEL FLEET\n\nThe Death Star and its Sanctuary Moon hang distant in space as the\nRebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar. The\nMillennium Falcon and several Rebel fighters are at the front as the\nspace armada bears down on its target.\n\n93   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nLando flips switches, checks his screen, and speaks into the radio.\n\nLANDO\nAll wings report in.\n\nWEDGE\nRed Leader standing by.\n\nGRAY LEADER\nGray Leader standing by.\n\nGREEN LEADER\nGreen Leader standing by.\n\nWEDGE\nLock S-foils in attack positions.\n\n94   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nFrom the bridge of the Rebel Headquarters Frigate, Admiral Ackbar\nwatches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen.\n\nACKBAR\nMay the Force be with us.\n\n95   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nLando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points to\nthe control panel and talks to Lando.\n\nLANDO\nWe've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up\nor down. Well, how\ncould they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming.\n\nLando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching Death Star as the\nimplications of what he's just said sink in. He hits a switch on his\ncomlink.\n\nLANDO\nBreak off the attack! The shield is still up.\n\nRED LEADER\t (VO)\nI get no reading. Are you sure?\n\nLANDO\nPull up! All craft pull up!\n\nThe Falcon turns hard to the left. Out the window the stars and the\nDeath Star move off right.\n\n96   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR SHIELD\n\nThe Falcon and the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to avoid\nthe unseen wall.\n\n97   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nAlarms are screaming and lights flashing as the huge ship changes\ncourse abruptly. Other ships in the fleet shoot by outside as the\narmada tries to halt its forward momentum.\n\nACKBAR\nTake evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7.\n\nA Mon Calamari controller turns away from his screen and calls out to\nAckbar, quite excited. The Admiral rushes over to the controller.\n\nCONTROLLER\nAdmiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.\n\nOn the screen can be seen the moon, Death Star, and the massive\nImperial fleet. Ackbar moves to the comlink.\n\nACKBAR\nIt's a trap!\n\nLANDO\t (over comlink)\nFighters coming in.\n\nThere is much excitement on the bridge as the attack begins.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon and several squads of Rebel fighters head into an\narmada of TIE fighters. The sky explodes as a fierce dogfight ensues in\nand around the giant Rebel cruisers.\n\nREBEL PILOT\nThere's too many of them!\n\nLANDO\nAccelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.\n\nWEDGE\nCopy, Gold Leader.\n\nThe battle continues around the giant cruisers.\n\n98   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM\n\nThrough the round window behind the Emperor's throne can be seen the\ndistant flashes of the space battle in progress.\n\nEMPEROR\nCome, boy. See for yourself.\n\nThe Emperor is sitting in his throne, with Vader standing at his side.\nLuke moves to look through a small section of the window.\n\nEMPEROR\nFrom here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and\nthe end of your insignificant Rebellion.\n\nLuke is in torment. He glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest\nof the throne. The Emperor watches him and smiles, touches the\nlightsaber.\n\nEMPEROR\nYou want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your\nJedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to\nyour anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my\nservant.\n\nVader watches Luke in his agony.\n\nLUKE\nNo!\n\nEMPEROR\nIt is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now\nmine!\n\n99   EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\n\nHan, Leia, Chewie, and the rest of the strike team are led out of the\nbunker by their captors. The surrounding area, deserted before, is now\ncrowded with two-legged Imperial walkers and hundreds of Imperial\ntroops. The situation looks hopeless.\n\nSTORMTROOPER\nAll right, move it! I said move it! Go on!\n\nFrom the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of beeps\nand whistles.\nAnd --\n\nTHREEPIO\nHello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?\n\nBUNKER COMMANDER\nBring those two down here!\n\nSTORMTROOPER\nLet's go!\n\nArtoo and Threepio are standing near one of the big trees. As six\nImperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two droids\nduck out of sight behind the tree.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWell, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?\n\nSTORMTROOPER\nFreeze! Don't move!\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe surrender.\n\nThe stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting\nquietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a\nband of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOhhh! Stand back, Artoo.\n\nIn a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK\nATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their\nfuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and\ntheir awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting\nEwoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the\ntrees above.\n\nIn the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for\nthe cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes\nto the bunker door control panel.\n\nLEIA\nThe code's changed. We need Artoo!\n\nHAN\nHere's the terminal.\n\nLEIA\t (into comlink)\nArtoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.\n\nArtoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround\nthem. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of\nwhistles and shoots off across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked,\nruns after him.\n\nTHREEPIO\nGoing? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo?\nNo, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!\n\nBiker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the\nlittle Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.\n\nA group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They\nfire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns\nand heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks\nabandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker\nmoves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge\nlogs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat.\n\nA line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's\nfoot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged\nbehind.\n\nTwo speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the scouts\nround a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between\ntwo trees.\n\n100  EXT SPACE\n\nThe Falcon and other Rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious combat\nwith Imperial TIE fighters, the battle raging around thecruisers of the\nRebel armada.\n\n101  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\nLando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other Rebel\nsquads.\n\nLANDO\nWatch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!\n\nWEDGE\nRed Three, Red Two, pull in!\n\nRED TWO\nGot it!\n\nRED THREE\nThree of them coming in, twenty degrees!\n\nWEDGE\nCut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical\nfrigate.\n\nLando steers the Falcon through a complete flip, as his crew fires at\nthe TIEs from the belly guns.\n\nNAVIGATOR\nPressure's steady.\n\nThe copilot Nien Nunb chatters an observation.\n\nLANDO\nOnly the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers\nare waiting for.\n\n102  EXT SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET\n\nThe giant Imperial Star Destroyer waits silently some distance from the\nbattle. The Emperor's huge Super Star Destroyer rests in the middle of\nthe fleet.\n\n103  INT SUPER STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\n\nAdmiral Piett and two fleet commanders watch the battle at the huge\nwindow of the Super Star Destroyer bridge.\n\nCOMMANDER\nWe're in attack position now, sir.\n\nPIETT\nHold here.\n\nCOMMANDER\nWe're not going to attack?\n\nPIETT\nI have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special\nplanned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.\n\n104  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\n\nThe Emperor, Vader, and a horrified Luke watch the aerial battle\nfireworks out the window and on the viewscreens. Another Rebel ship\nexplodes against the protective shield.\n\nEMPEROR\nAs you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now\nwitness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle\nstation.\n(into comlink)\nFire at will, Commander.\n\nLuke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the Death Star to the\nRebel fleet beyond.\n\n105  INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\n\nControllers pull back on several switches. Commander Jerjerrod stands\nover them.\n\nJERJERROD\nFire!\n\n106  INT DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER\n\nA button is pressed, which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded\nImperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. A huge beam of\nlight emanates from a long shaft. Two stormtroopers stand to one side\nat a control panel.\n\n107  EXT DEATH STAR\n\nThe giant laser dish on the completed half of the Death Star begins to\nglow; Then a powerful beams shoots out toward the aerial battle.\n\n108  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE\n\nThe air is thick with giant ships. In among them, Rebel X-wings\ndogfight with Imperial TIE fighters. Now an enormous Rebel cruiser is\nhit by the Death Star beam and is blown to dust.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon roars over CAMERA, followed closely byseveral TIE\nfighters.\n\n109  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nThe ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the Rebel cruiser.\nLando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the Death Star\nfirepower.\n\nLANDO\nThat blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational!\n(into comlink)\nHome One, this is Gold Leader.\n\n110  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nAckbar stands amid the confusion on the wide bridge and speaks into the\ncomlink.\n\nACKBAR\nWe saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.\n\nLANDO\nYou won't get another chance at this, Admiral.\n\nACKBAR\nWe have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel\nfirepower of that magnitude.\n\nLANDO\nHan will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.\n\n111  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\n\nArtoo and Threepio make it to the door, as Han and Leia provide cover\nfire.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe're coming!\n\nHAN\nCome on! Come on!\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, Artoo, hurry!\n\nThe little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. A\nlarge explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally\nlanding on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and\nsmoldering. Suddenly there is a loud SPROOING and Han and Leia turn\naround to see Artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his\nappendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in\nhis body. Han rushes to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded\ncompanion.\n\nTHREEPIO\nMy goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?\n\nHAN\nWell, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.\n\nLEIA\nI'll cover you.\n\nEwoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the\nstormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries.  One is hit in the\nwing with laser fire and crashes. A walker lumbers forward, shooting\nlaser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all directions.  Two Ewoks are\nstruck down by laser blasts.  One tries to awaken his friend, then\nrealizes that he is dead.\n\n112  EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR\n\nThe Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the Death\nStar's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging Imperial Star\nDestroyers.\n\n113  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nLando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating\ngiants. He's been yelling into the comlink.\n\nLANDO\t (desperately)\nYes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star\nDestroyers at point-\nblank range.\n\nACKBAR\nAt that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.\n\nLANDO\nWe'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might\njust take a few of\nthem with us.\n\nThe Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star Destroyers and\nbegin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the\ngiant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire.\n\nThe control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack.\n\nREBEL PILOT\nShe's gonna blow!\n\nY-WING PILOT\nI'm hit!\n\nThe damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and crashes into\nthe control tower, exploding.\n\n114  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\n\nOut of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is being\ndecimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But in here there\nis no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke.\n\nEMPEROR\nYour fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not\nsurvive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will\ndie...as will your friends.\n\nLuke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.\n\nEMPEROR\nGood. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon!\nStrike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark\nside will be complete.\n\nLuke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He\nignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber\nflashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the\nEmperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his\nfather.\n\n115  EXT FOREST\n\nThe battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with sophisticated\nweapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the\nImperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs.\n\nA walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it goes. An\nEwok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. The\nlogs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until\nit finally topples over with a great crash.\n\nA scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The other end\nof the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever-\ntightening circles until it runs out of rope and\ncrashes into the trees with a huge explosion.\n\nChewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two Ewoks\ncling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine,\nthen hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks peeks through the window.\n\nWALKER PILOT #1\nLook!\n\nPILOT #2\nGet him off of there!\n\nThe walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is yanked\nout and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two Ewoks jump into\nthe cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. The Ewoks are\nthrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. Outside,\nChewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch\nwith a series of angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to\nlisten to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker.\n\nChewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at\nunsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial walkers. The\nEwoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the\nbattle in their favor.\n\n116  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\n\nHan works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to\nhotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting away at some\nstormtroopers.\n\nHAN\nI think I got it. I got it!\n\nThe three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a\nsecond blast door crashes down in front of the first.\n\nHan frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with\nstormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her\nshoulder hit by a laser blast.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, Princess Leia, are you all right?\n\nHAN\nLet's see.\n\nLEIA\nIt's not bad.\n\nSTORMTROOPER\t (OS)\nFreeze!\n\nThey freeze.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, dear.\n\nSTORMTROOPER\nDon't move!\n\nLeia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the two\nstormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia's eyes lock; the moment\nseems suspended in time.\n\nHAN\nI love you.\n\nAnother shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han.\n\nLEIA\nI know.\n\nSTORMTROOPER\nHands up! Stand up!\n\nHan stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand. She\ndisposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back toward\nLeia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him,\nits deadly weapons aimed right at him.\n\nHAN\t (to Leia)\nStay back.\n\nThe hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head out and\nbarks triumphantly.\n\nHAN\nChewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.\n\n117  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\n\nLuke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even\nmore vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young Jedi has grown\nstronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. Vader is\nforced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. Luke\nstands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack.\n\nEMPEROR (laughing)\nGood.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through\nyou.\n\nLuke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader, and\nrealizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off his\nlightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.\n\nVADER\nObi-Wan has taught you well.\n\nLUKE\nI will not fight you, father.\n\nVader walks back up the stairs to Luke.\n\nVADER\nYou are unwise to lower your defenses.\n\nVader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi leaps in an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader stands below him.\n\nLUKE\nYour thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the\nconflict.\n\nVADER\nThere is no conflict.\n\nLUKE\nYou couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe\nyou'll destroy me now.\n\nVADER\nYou underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight,\nthen you will meet your destiny.\n\nVader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding the catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's platform. Vader moves to find him.\n\nEMPEROR\t (laughs)\nGood.  Good.\n\n118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE\n\nThe two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each\nother in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star Destroyer\nexplodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a\nseries of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next\nto a second Star Destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the\nImperial Star Destroyer with it. The Falcon and several fighters attack\none of the larger Imperial ships.\n\nLANDO\nWatch out. Squad at .06.\n\nREBEL PILOT\nI'm on it, Gold Leader.\n\nWEDGE\nGood shot, Red Two.\n\nLANDO\nNow...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.\n\n119  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM\n\nControllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of an\nImperial walker pilot can be seen. There is a great deal of static and\ninterference.\n\nHAN/PILOT\t (VO)\nIt's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into\nthe woods. We\nneed reinforcements to continue the pursuit.\n\nThe controllers cheer.\n\nCONTROL ROOM COMMANDER\nSend three squads to help. Open the back door.\n\nSECOND COMMANDER\nYes, sir.\n\n120  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\n\nAs the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out,\nthey're surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their\nweapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the\nroof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns\nas Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges.\n\n121  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM\n\nHan, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant\nexplosive charges on the control panels and rush out.\n\nHAN\nThrow me another charge.\n\n122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\n\nVader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne,\nsearching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready.\n\nVADER\nYou cannot hide forever, Luke.\n\nLUKE\nI will not fight you.\n\nVADER\nGive yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your\nfriends. Yes, your\nthoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially\nfor...\n\nVader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in\nanguish.\n\nVADER\nSister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed\nher, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.\n\nLUKE\nNever-r-r!\n\nLuke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather\nwith a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader\nfight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of\nthe low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft.\nEach stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.\n\nThe Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to\nblock another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the\nwrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical\nstump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the\nedge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves\nover Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat.\nThe Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation.\n\nEMPEROR\nGood! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!\n\nLuke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical,\nblack-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his\nfather. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in\npreparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away.\n\nLUKE\nNever! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness.\nI am a Jedi, like my father before me.\n\nThe Emperor's glee turns to rage.\n\nEMPEROR\nSo be it...Jedi.\n\n123  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\n\nHan and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across\nthe clearing.\n\nHAN\nMove! Move!\n\nA shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by a\nspectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes\nalong with the bunker.\n\n124  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nAckbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio.\n\nACKBAR\nThe shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.\n\nLANDO\nWe're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.\n(laughs)\nTold you they'd do it!\n\nThe Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads toward\nthe unfinished superstructure of the Death Star.\n\n125  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\n\nLuke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. The Emperor's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his arms toward Luke.\n\nEMPEROR\nIf you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.\n\nBlinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's\nhands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi tries to use the\nForce to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a\nmoment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the young Jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader struggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side.\n\nEMPEROR\nYoung fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.\n\nLuke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the\nEmperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling into\nthe bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.\n\nEMPEROR\nYour feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You\nhave paid the price for your lack of vision.\n\nLuke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward\nwhere Vader stands watching.\n\nLUKE\t (groans)\nFather, please. Help me.\n\nAgain Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the Emperor, then back to Luke on the floor.\n\nEMPEROR\nNow, young Skywalker...you will die.\n\nAlthough it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound screaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain.\n\nVader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm. The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his helmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of the throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength, Darth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.\n\nThe Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls\ninto the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it\nexplodes, creating a rush of air through the room.Vader's cape is\nwhipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the\nbottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away\nfrom the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi and the giant\nwarrior are too weak to move.\n\n126  EXT/INT - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR\n\nRebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death Star\nto the unfinished portion, where they dive into the superstructure of\nthe giant battle station, followed by many TIE fighters.\n\nWEDGE\nI'm going in.\n\nLANDO\nHere goes nothing.\n\nThree X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed\nby the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters who\ncontinually fire at the Rebels. Lights reflect off the pilot's faces as\nthey race through the dark shaft.\n\nLANDO\nNow lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power\ngenerator.\n\nWEDGE\nForm up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.\n\nThe fighters and the Falcon race through the tunnel, still pursued by\nthe TIE fighters. One of the X-wings is hit from behind and explodes.\n\nLANDO\nSplit up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of\nthose TIE fighters to\nfollow you.\n\nPILOT\nCopy, Gold Leader.\n\nThe Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the TIE's, while Lando and\nWedge continue through the main tunnel. It narrows, and the Falcon\nscrapes the side dangerously. Two other TIE fighters continue to blast\naway at them.\n\nLANDO\nThat was too close.\n\nNien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet rages\non. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star Destroyer.\n\n127  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nACKBAR\nWe've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on\nthat Super Star Destroyer.\n\nX-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship.\n\n128  INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\n\nAdmiral Piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to the\nbattle. They look concerned.\n\nCONTROLLER\nSir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.\n\nPIETT\nIntensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.\n\nThe commander is looking out of the window where a damaged Rebel\nfighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge.\n\nPIETT\nIntensify forward firepower!\n\nCOMMANDER\nIt's too late!\n\nThe Rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the Star Destroyer, causing a\nhuge explosion. The giant battle ship loses control, crashes into the\nDeath Star, and explodes.\n\n129  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nThere is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all sides.\nThey cheer as the giant Star Destroyer blows up.\n\n130  INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY\n\nChaos. For the first time, the Death Star is rocked by explosions as\nthe Rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over, unloading\na heavy barrage. Imperial troops run in all directions, confused and\ndesperate to escape.\n\nIn the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous\ndeadweight of his father's weakening body toward an Imperial shuttle.\nFinally, Luke collapses from the strain. The explosions grow louder as\nVader draws him closer.\n\nVADER\t (a whisper)\nLuke, help me take this mask off.\n\nLURE\nBut you'll die.\n\nVADER\nNothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my\nown eyes.\n\nSlowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father's face. There\nbeneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus. But the\ndying man smiles at the sight before him.\n\nANAKIN\t (very weak)\nNow...go, my son. Leave me.\n\nLUKE\nNo. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save\nyou.\n\nANAKIN\nYou already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you\nwere right.\n\nLUKE\nFather...I won't leave you.\n\nDarth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies.\n\nA huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half\ncarrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a\nshuttle.\n\n131  EXT DEATH STAR\n\nThe Millennium Falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the immense\nsuperstructure of the half-built Death Star. The Rebel Star Cruisers\noutside continually bombard the huge station. And each direct hit is\nanswered by resonating, chain-reaction explosions within the station\nitself.\n\n132  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT AND GUN PORTS\n\nLando's crew fires away at the pursuing TIE fighters as the dashing\nBaron of Bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main reactor\nshaft. It is awesome. A lone X-wing is just in front of the Falcon.\n\nWEDGE\nThere it is!\n\nLANDO\nAll right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.\n\nWEDGE\nCopy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.\n\nThe X-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires several\nproton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series of small\nexplosions.\n\nThe Falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously\nclose, Lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the Falcon with a\npowerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main reactor.\n\nHe maneuvers the Falcon out of the winding superstructure just ahead of\nthe continuing chain of explosions.\n\n133  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\n\nAckbar and other Mon Calamari lean on the railing of the bridge,\nwatching the large screen showing the Death Star in the main briefing\nroom.\n\nACKBAR\nMove the fleet away from the Death Star.\n\n134  EXT DEATH STAR\n\nAn Imperial shuttle, with Luke alone in the cockpit, rockets out of the\nmain docking bay as that entire section of the Death Star is blown\naway.\n\nFinally, just as it looks like the Falcon will not make it, Lando\nexpertly pilots the craft out of the exploding superstructure and\nwhizzes toward the Sanctuary Moon, only a moment before the Death Star\nsupernovas into oblivion.\n\n135  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nLando and Nien Nunb laugh and cheer in relief.\n\n136  EXT ENDOR FOREST\n\nHan and Leia, Chewie, the droids, the Rebel troops, and the Ewoks all\nlook to the sky as the Death Star reveals itself in a final flash of\nself-destruction. They all cheer.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThey did it!\n\nHan looks town from the sky to Leia, a look of concern on his face.\nLeia continues to look at the sky as though listening for a silent\nvoice.\n\nHAN\nI'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.\n\nLEIA\nHe wasn't. I can feel it.\n\nHAN\nYou love him, don't you?\n\nLeia smiles, puzzled.\n\nLEIA\nYes.\n\nHAN\nAll right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the\nway.\n\nShe realizes his misunderstanding.\n\nLEIA\nOh. No, it's not like that at all. He's my brother.\n\nHan is stunned by this news. She smiles, and they embrace.\n\n137  EXT ENDOR FOREST - NIGHT\n\nLuke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where his\nfather's body lies, again dressed in black mask and helmet. He stands,\nwatching sadly, as the flames leap higher to consume Darth Vader --\nAnakin Skywalker.\n\nIn the sky above, fireworks explode and Rebel fighters zoom above the\nforest.\n\n138  EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT\n\nA huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration. Rebels and\nEwoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating, singing,\ndancing, and laughing in the communal language of victory and\nliberation.\n\nLando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by Han and Chewie. Then,\nfinally, Luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and embrace him.\nThey stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort in each other's\ntouch, together to the end.\n\nRebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The original\ngroup of adventurers watch from the sidelines. Only Luke seems\ndistracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere.\n\nHe looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling figures at\nthe edge of the shadows: Ben Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nEND CREDITS OVER STAR FIELD5Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/439504", "artist_names": "Chuck Berry", "full_title": "Merry Christmas Baby by\u00a0Chuck\u00a0Berry", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/3d3451d754be398dc52cb69859249dd1.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3d3451d754be398dc52cb69859249dd1.600x600x1.jpg", "id": 439504, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 354381, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1401204146, "path": "/Chuck-berry-merry-christmas-baby-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Chuck-berry-merry-christmas-baby-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1964, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1964", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1964", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/3d3451d754be398dc52cb69859249dd1.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3d3451d754be398dc52cb69859249dd1.600x600x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Merry Christmas Baby", "title_with_featured": "Merry Christmas Baby", "updated_by_human_at": 1551417443, "url": "https://genius.com/Chuck-berry-merry-christmas-baby-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/19340", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f21824f0b94d37c44b387118d337bf43.640x421x1.jpg", "id": 19340, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/af5bfacf7d280d1d9805c1bfbcf86d21.560x560x1.jpg", "index_character": "c", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Chuck Berry", "slug": "Chuck-berry", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Chuck-berry"}, "artist": "Chuck Berry", "lyrics": "Merry Christmas Baby Lyrics[Chorus][x2]\nMerry Christmas baby\nYou really did treat me nice\n\n[Verse 1]\nBought me a hi-fi for Christmas\nNow I'm living in paradise\nWell I'm feeling mighty fine\nI got good music on my radio\nWell I feel so fine\nI got good music on my radio\nYes I want to hug and kiss you baby\nWhile you're standing beneath the mistletoe\nSanta came down the chimney\nAbout a half past three\nLeft all these pretty presents\nThat you see before me\nMerry Christmas baby\nYou really been good to me\nI will always love you baby\nNow I'm happy as I can beYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 19, "api_path": "/songs/66327", "artist_names": "David Foster Wallace (Ft.

Hennigan, U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, 1974\n\nTHE SEEK BUTTON on the Ford's radio is working. The downtown recedes. Miles of neighborhoods fill the windshield. The SEEK function locks on someplace in stereo, college FM probably. \"Yeah,\" a new friend says, \"Whas up. Whas goin on.\" The radio has another button, VOL, which gets jacked repeatedly while the Ford hurtles, happily, to the source of the noise. Not to the station's broadcast booth on a campus across the river, nor to its transmission towers in the suburbs, but rather to RJam Productions in North Dorchester, where black kids from Boston's now-integrated high schools-Latin, Madison Park, Jeremiah Burke, Mattapan-cut demos and dream of being bigger than even the radio's new friend, a young man named Schoolly D who right now, at speaker-damaging volume, sounds darn big. \"Before we start this next record\u2026,\" Schooly's saying. The record in question is called \"Signifying Rapper,\" a brief, bloody tale of ghetto retribution from Side 2 of Schoolly's Smoke Some Kill.\nThe black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in '74, and evidence is everywhere that nothing's changed since then. On the southbound left of the Fitzgerald Expressway pass 20 blocks of grim Irish-Catholic housing projects, the western border of Belfast, complete with Sinn Fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious United Ireland, a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the '74 court order that bused \"Them\" from wherever it is \"They\" live-the Third World fer crissakes--into 97-percent-white South Boston. On the Expressway's right is the place the fibula-busters are talking about: the simultaneous northern border of Haiti, Jamaica and Georgia; a territory that maps of Boston call North Dorchester.\n\nUniting the two sides of the Expressway is just about nothing. Both neighborhoods are tough and poor. Both hate the college world across the river, which, because of Boston's rotten public schools, they will never see as freshmen. And kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio, which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting the art of a ghetto Philadelphian roughly their age, once much poorer than they, but now, on royalties from Smoke Some Kill, very much richer.\n\nNot that the shared digging of black street music is news, or even new: twenty years ago, when Morgan v. Hennigan, Boston's own Brown v. Board of Education, was inching through the courts, and even dark-complected Italians were sometimes unwelcome in the Irish precincts east of the Expressway, kids in Boston's Little Belfast sang along with James Brown over the radio.\n\"Say it loud\nI'm black and I'm proud\nSay it loud\nI'm black and I'm proud!\"\n\nExcept that halfway through the infectious funk, the crewcuts realize what they're saying: Jesus christ, \"I'm proud to be black\" fer chrissakes, like when you're in the porno store, you know, and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the men's part, you know? not the part for men in the part that's about men, Jesus, and you get the hell outta there. And so they hum/mumble the suppressed parts.\n\n\"Say it loud\nI'm mmm hum proud\nSay it loud\nMum hum hum proud!\"\n\nBut rap isn't funk, rock or jazz, and the vast crossover move, broadcasting \"ghetto\" music over college radios to ghettos of a different color, is no simple reenactment of past crossovers. How, for example, does the sing-along fan of Smoke Some Kill mumble his way through these lines:\n\n\"Black is beautiful\nBrown is sick? slick? stiff?\nYellow's OK\nBut white ain't shit.\"\n\nRjam Productions, modestly headquartered in a mixed black/Hispanic Field, Corner section of North Dorchester, is as follows:\n\n* One (1) four-car garage fitted with dubbing and remastering gear worth more than most of the rest of the real estate on the block;\n* One (1) touch-tone telephone (leased);\n* Two (2) Chevy Blazers, vanity-plated RJAM1 and RJAM2, each equipped with cellular phones and slick tape decks (also leased);\n* One (1) VCR with Kathleen Turner's Body Heat cued up on the morning in question;\n* Most importantly, eight (8) promising acts under binding contract\nIf, as has happened to many local labels, Rjam were liquidated to satisfy creditors, these would be the pieces. But there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneer's gavel. Schoolly D, the original Signifying Rapper, looms irresistibly from the pages of rap \"fanzines\" Hip-Hop and The Source; and Rjam's prime, unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next Schoolly D. Or the next Ice T, or Kool Moe Dee, or L. L. Cool J., or whoever's the special hero of the kid cutting the demo. On this particular morning, the dream is to be the next MC Lyte--a hard-rapping woman known for jams like \"MC Lyte vs. Vanna Whyte\" and \"10% Dis\"--since today is Tam-Tam's day and Tam-Tam is, at 16, a tough girl in the MC Lyte mold who, like MC Lyte, can dance, look good, and tell men to beat it, all at once.\n\nOr so claims Tam-Tam's producer, promoter, and dutch uncle, Gary Smith, who opened RJam on Martin Luther King's birthday, '89, with his older brother Nate. Nate, the elder statesman, is 25. Gary, 22, runs the company while Nate travels with his boyhood-friend-turned-boss, quadruple-platinum, Prince-derived rapper/singer, Bobby Brown. RJam was founded in part with an investment from the 23-year-old multi-millionaire Brown, a native of Roxbury. Brown now lives in Los Angeles.\n\nNate and Gary Smith turn a healthy profit making demos at $500/tape, but the brothers aren't in the health business. Their aim: to follow in the corporate footsteps of Def Jam, a once similarly tiny production company run from a basement in Hollis, Queens, which since its basement days, has given America Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J., the Beastie Boys, and much of the rest of that culture-quake called rap. Gary Smith doesn't compare RJam to Def Jam, and, unlike Def Jam's Russell Simmons, Gary produces pop, soul, and R&B as well as straight rap, and actually prefers R&B. But how many sophomores at nearby Jeremiah Burke can afford to dream in R&B, to front music lessons and $500 for an nth-hand sound set-up, find three friends to learn drums, bass and keyboards, and then raise another $500 to make a demo at RJam? Anybody with a larynx can rap, however, and Rjam's brisk business in rap demos pays the taxman, Boston Edison and the Chevrolet Motor Credit Corp.\n\nTwenty minutes farther south on the Fitzgerald Expressway, across the Neponset River and into the pricey suburbs, is the scene of John Cheever's boyhood, more recently celebrated as Massachusetts Miracle country, where technology ventures are started at the rate of five per week, four of which will fail within 12 months. RJam's Gary Smith is secret brother to the men of the suburban Chambers of Commerce, sharing their worries about cash flow, overhead, and the enforceability of his contracts; but Gary's world and theirs are as far apart as those of Ward and Eldridge Cleaver. Worriers in suburbia fear that ballooning property values will hike taxes on computer executives' seaside homes. In Gary's neighborhood, property values are actually falling.\n\nWaiting less than patiently for Tam-Tam, Gary honks twice. A tall, grave girl with an angel's heart-shaped face crosses the ghetto street and climbs into the back seat of RJAM1. She has, apparently, at least two voices, the cynical, sexy rant heard on tape this morning telling Pebbles men ain't worth it, and the whisper in which she now says hello.\n\nAs RJAM1 re-crosses North Dorchester, heading back to the soundproof studios to get the day's work started, Gary and DJ Reese hash out production details. Tam-Tam's a dignified island in the back seat, and a shiver accompanies the thought that this could be the Motor City in '63 with Berry Gordy and an eighty-pound teenage Diana Ross, just voted Best Dressed at Cass Technical High School, driving crosstown to record a little number called \"Where Did Our Love Go.\"\n\nAsk Tam-Tam about Diana Ross, and she gives a beatific smile. She's 16; she can remember only with difficulty the first rap she ever listened to, when rap was new and she was 8; Run-DMC or somebody, she mumbles in response to what suddenly seems a foolish question about her influences. Like most of rap's black audience (as distinct from rap's white audience, which is usually a decade older), Tam-Tam has no first-hand recollection of James Brown except as a source for rap. She is too young to have attended segregated schools. She was in diapers during the violent first few months of desegregation in Boston and can't remember the awful day in '74 when \"pro-neighborhood\" marchers from Irish South Boston came upon a black pedestrian at City Hall and beat him with pole-mounted American flags.\n\nTam-Tam has star presence, and like many who do, she seems to see very little of what goes on around her, the price of the star's intense focus on self. She reminds you of Senator Gary Hart. He, too, had star presence. In front of a crowd, Hart was riveting; in the elevator riding up to the auditorium, he was barely there. Being barely there in the neighborhood Tam-Tam calls home is probably not such a bad thing, and perhaps her drive to be star someday is an elaborate way to wall out the now and here. Ambition is, finally, a form of hope, a scarce commodity in North Dorchester.\n\nBack in Rjam's control booth, Dj Reese and producer Ralph Stacey are programming the rhythm track for what will be \"Ho, You're Guilty.\" Drum parts are taken from a Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, a synth which electronically reproduces programmed beats on the user's choice of drum-matrix. The TR-909's keys, on a console designed to resemble, vaguely, the familiar piano, are named after the sound each creates-bass, snare, mid-tom, hi-tom--and the sounds are named after the actual drums which, until the TR-909, were required to make those sounds. The TR-909 even sports a key named HAND CLAP, making it possible for the first time ever to clap hands with a single finger, rendering obsolete the Zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping. The finished \"Ho, You're Guilty\" will sound lush with percussion, melody, and instrumental breaks. Not one human musician will be employed in the recording process.\n\nEach percussion line is programmed onto the mixing board as a separate track: a snare track, a bass track, a clap track, etc. Reese has been studying the classics lately, too, viz: James Brown's Dead on the Heavy Funk from '75ish, including the ageless groove, \"Funky President,\" in which James announces his third-party candidacy. Some of Bobby Byrd's Dead guitar, and a holy moment when James exhales rhythmically, have been isolated from a store-bought cassette of Dead, re-recorded on clean tape, then re-re-recorded onto a computer-readable memory diskette from which the sample is retrieved and altered by Ralph Stacey using a Roland D-50 linear synth. The guitar and the exhalation then go, as altered, from the synth to yet another of the 24 tracks on the big mixing board. Reese, the DJ, will weave a seamless rhythm track out of these 24 strands.\n\nAs Reese and Ralph Stacey mix the 24 tracks onto one master tape, Tam-Tam sips lemonade in the corner of the booth. You ask her if she is interested someday in learning about the obscure digital technology the two men manipulate on her behalf. She doesn't seem to register the question. \"The other career besides rap I'd like to pursue is modelling,\" she says. \"I'm five-seven. That's the perfect height for a model.\"\n\nMixing takes the rest of the day. Producer Ralph Stacey at one late point corners you with a flinty stare and an uncomfortable question: \"Why do you want to write about rap, anyway?\" It is lucky that at that minute Reese is done mixing. Tomorrow the RJam staff will tape Tam-Tam's vocal track and lay this over Reese's rhythm track. Then the sound will be \"fattened\" with stacks of horns, guitar hooks, bells, canned applause, and whatever else they decide to take from other tapes or work up on the Rolands. The final demo tape of \"Ho, You're Guilty\" will then be shopped to the 20 major, minor, and tiny labels who might release the demo as a 12-inch single.\n\nEveryone's ready to call it a day. Gary Smith's already huddled with some new wanna-be stars in RJam's reception area. Reese plays the mixed rhythm track once through over the big speakers in the control booth, and Tam-Tam immediately stands, modelling forgotten, utterly alert. Reese gestures to her with maestro hands. She raps at an absent Antoinette in the hard, sexy voice you haven't heard since this morning, extemporaneous but on beat:\n\"I'm a female\nYou're just a fairytale.\"\n\nThe small-w we here are two white Boston males: one native, one oft-transplanted; both residing in Somerbridge, a dim, ethnic-Portuguese neighborhood whose gentrification we abet. M. is an attorney with a taste for jazz, Blues, funk; D. a grad student and would-be drifter who watches TV instead of sleeping. Our cultural tastes and interests are day and night. They converged only lately, when D's stereo arrived UPS and we discovered we shared an uncomfortable, somewhat furtive, and distinctively white enthusiasm for a certain music called rap/hip-hop.* About our passions and discomforts we could determine only that they were vague & distinct contexts and cathexes brought to bear across the same ethnic distance on the same thing. For instance, we agreed that real or serious rap is not JJ FAD or Tone Loc or Beasties, Egyptian Lover or Fat Boys, not experiments or freakshows or current commercial crossover slush. \"Serious\" rap--a unique U.S. inner-city fusion of funk, technified reggae, teen-to-teen \"hardcore\" rock, and the early 70s \"poetry of the black experience\" of Nikki Giavonni, the Last Poets, etc.--has, since its late-70s delivery at the record-scratching hands of Afrika Bambaataa and his Zulu Nation, Sugarhill Gang, Kool Herc and his automated Herculords, and Grandmaster Flash, always had its real roots in the Neighborhood, the black gang-banger Underground. Black music, of and for blacks.\n\nWe concurred as to the wheres and whens of rap's begetting--mid-to-late 70s' South Bronx house parties; then, by decade's end, block parties, with municipal electric lights tapped for a power source, literal dancing in the streets; by '82, regular rap-houses and then \"floating clubs\"--the Roxy every Sunday, The Bronx's Disco Fever TWTh--everybody Breaking to a new musical antimusic being fashioned from records and turntables and an amateur DJs ad-lib banter; a very heavy reggae influence at the beginning; the more rhythmic pure rap an offshoot, its brisker, sparer, backbeat designed for Breakdance, and the smooth-rapping partygoer who just didn't want to shut up when others' music was on. We agreed, too, on rough chronology: amateur house-partiers giving way to professional DJs, pioneers; they, too, then overshadowed by new art-entrepreneurs, former Breakers, failed singers, gag-majorettes; then the rise of \"Indies,\" the tiny independent labels that keep most new music on life-support--Sugar Hill, Jive, Tommy Boy, Wild Pitch, Profile Records, Enjoy--then, after King Tim III's \"Personality Jock\" and Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight,\" an entree into urban black radio; then to underground \"Mix\" radio; then corporate levels, digital technology, very big money, the early-80s talent that became an early Scene's cream--Spoonie G. and Sequence, Eric Fresh, Unknown DJ, Egyptian Lover and Run-DMC. Then, Spring '84, the extraordinary Midas touch of Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons' Def Jam label (now under contract to CBS) from which sprang a mid-80s stable of true stars, in the Underground--Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J, Slick Rick, the still-unparalleled Eric B. and Rakim--and L.A.'s alternatives: Kool Moe Dee, L.A. Dream Team, and others. And now, at decade's end, an absolute explosion of rap-as-pop, big business, MTV, special fashions, posters, merchandise, with only a few big, new, cutting-edge acts--L.A.'s N.W.A., Philadelphia's Schoolly D, Miami's 2 Live Crew, De La Soul's House-blend of rap/funk/jazz--remaining too esoteric or threatening or downright obscene to cross all the way over and cash in with big labels. By '89 rap is finally proving as \"important\" (read also lucrative) to an anemic shock-and rebellion-music industry as Punk was an exact decade ago. This was all just data. We agreed on it, and on how it was curious that we both had such strange, distant facts down cold.\n\nOur point of departure, essay-wise, was always less what we know than what we felt, listening: less what we liked than why. For this attempt at an outside sampler we plunked down and listened to thousands of hours of rap, trying to summon a kind of objective, critical, purely \"aesthetic\" passion that the music itself made impossible. For outsiders, rap's easy to move to, hard to dissect. The more we listened and thought and drank beers and argued, the more we felt that the stuff's appeal for two highbrow, upscale whites was just plain incongruous. Because serious rap has, right from the start, presented itself as a closed show. Usually critical questions of culture, context, background and audience reduce quickly to vexed questions about prepositions. Not here. No question that serious rap is, and is very self-consciously, music by urban blacks about same to and for same. To mainstream whites it's a tight cohesion that can't but look, from outside the cultural window, like occlusion, clannishness (sic) and inbreeding, a kind of reverse snobbery about what's \"def\" and \"fresh\" and in-the-Scene that eerily recalls the exclusionary codes of college Societies and WASP-only country clubs. Serious rap is a musical movement that seems to revile whites as a group or Establishment, and simply to ignore their possibility as distinct individuals--the Great White Male is rap's Grand Inquisitor, its idiot questioner--its Alien Other no less than Reds were for McCarthy. The music's paranoia, together with its hermetic racial context, helps explain why from the outside it appears to us just as vibrant and impassioned as it does alien and scary.\n\nOther incongruities. Rap is a \"music\" essentially without melody, built instead around a digitally synthesized drum- and back-beat often about as complex as five idle fingers on a waiting-room table, enhanced by \"sampled\" (pirated) \"krush grooves\" (licks or repetitive chord-series) conceived and recorded by pre-rap rock icons, the whole affair characterized by a distinctive, spare, noisy, clattering \"style\" whose obsessive if limited thematics revolve with the speed of low-I amperage around the performative circuit of the MC/rapper and his record-scratching, sound-mixing Sancho Panza, the DJ.\n\nThe rapper (the guy in the cameo cut or Kangol hat, pricey warm-up, unlaced Adidas, extra thick gold chain or oversized medallion) offers lyrics that are spoken or bellowed in straight, stressed, rhymed verse, the verse's syntax and meter often tortured for rhythmic gain or the kind of limboing-for-rhyme we tend to associate with doggerel about men from Nantucket. The lyrics, nearly always self-referential, tend to be variations on about half a dozen basic themes, themes that at first listen can seem less alien or shocking than downright dull. Eg: just how bad/cool/fresh/def the rapper and his lyrics are; just how equally un-all-these his music rivals are; how troublesome, vacuous and acquisitive women are; how wonderful it is to be \"paid in full\" for rapping instead of stealing or dealing; how gangs are really families, 'caine's constant bad news. And, in particular, how sex and violence and yuppie toys represent perfectly the urban black lifedrive to late-80s American glory.\n\nThe masks are many, too many for anything really but direct aural inspection: rap personae can change frequently even within single albums, the rapper delivering Hard, violent Black Nationalist communique on one cut, dubbing against Trinidadian steel drums on another, basking in big label eclat on a third, cracking a head and then defly outwitting someone muscled and dumb, cooing to his \"bitch\" and then on the flip side, threatening to go get his gun again if she can't learn who's boss. Though any crew naturally wants its own distinctive game and face, the quintessential rap group is unquintessential, chameleonesque. This is either by weird design, or it's a symptom and symbol of 80s facelessness\u2026or most likely, it's just a good old venerable synecdoche of rap's genre itself, one that's now moving so fast it can't quite fix on its own identity -- much less hold still for anything like cool, critical classification or assessment, from outside.\n\nThe MC's Alice Toklas-esque DJ hovers ever nearby over his buffet of connected turntables and the black Germanness of a whole lot of digital editing & playback equipment. His responsibility is the song behind and around the rap -- the backbeat, krush groove, and the \"sound carpet,\" i.e. a kind of electric aural environment, a chaos behind the rapper's rhymed order, a digitalized blend of snippets, squeaks, screams, sirens, snatches from pop media, all mixed and splattered so that the listener cannot really listen but only feel the resultant mash of \"samples\" that results. The most recognizable of these samples range from staccato record-scratches to James Brown and Funkadelic licks, to M.L.K.'s public Dream, to quotidian pop pap like \"The Theme from Shaft,\" Brady Bunch dialogue, and '50s detergent commercials.\n\nWe have now read every review and essay to do with serious underground hip-hop available in every single on-line periodical ... xcept for one or two underground newsletters (viz. The City Sun, Fresh-Est) circulated in parts of the Bronx demimonde where learning about rap is as hard for white outsiders as scoring fine China White or AKs. From the kind of sedulous bibliomaniacal research to be expected of conscientious lawyers and PhDs, the following has become clear. Outside England, where the Punk-weaned audience has developed a taste for spectacle-through-windows, for vicarious Rage and Protest against circumstances that have exactly 0% to do with them, most of what Rolling Stone calls \"devoted rock consumers\" (meaning we post-baby-boomers), plus almost all established rock critics, tend to regard non-crossover rap as essentially boring and simplistic, or swaggering and bellicose and dangerous--at all events, basically vapid and empty because of its obsessive self-referentiality\u2026in short, as closed to them, to us, as a music. Unrecognizable as what we've been trained and adverted to buy as pop.... Great to dance to, of course, but then what might the white audience for today's mainstream expect? Rap, whether fecund or sterile, is today's pop music's lone cutting edge, the new, the unfamiliar, the brain-resisted-while-body-boogies. And that resisted, alien, exhilarating cutting edge has always been black.\n\n\"What have you left me? what have I got?\nLast night in cold blood my young brother got shot\nMy homey got jacked\nMy mother's on crack\nMy sister can't work cause her arms show tracks\nMadness, insanity\nLive in profanity\nThen some punk claim that they understandin' me?\nGive me a break--what world do you live in?\nDeath is my sex--guess my religion.\"**\n\nWhat makes this stuff so much more disturbing, more real to outsiders than the Punk Rock even those of us who remember it could never quite take seriously? Maybe even a closed music has to have some kind of detente with received custom: I always found it tough to listen straight-faced to a nihilist lecture from someone with a chartreuse mohawk and an earring in his eyelid who punctuates his delivery with vomit and spit. All doctrine and pronouncement, exclusively anti-, this Punk of a decade past afforded even willing mainstream listeners no easement across cultural void, nothing human to grab onto. I have no idea what a Punk performer thinks, feels, is, day-to-day... in fact I always suspected he had no day, but just retreated to his plush coffin at cockcrow. Can you imagine a Punk with four-foot hair and spiked jacket and nose-ring, say, eating a bologna sandwich? Replacing a light bulb? Putting a quarter in a meter? Not me, boy. And even Barnum, who knew fear sells, also knew that freakshows aren't frightening when the freakishness supplants all resemblance. 0% affinity = 0% empathy. And fear requires empathy as much as it does menace or threat.\n\nPublic Enemy and N.W.A., Ice T and Schoolly D discomfit us, our friends, the critics we read and cornered, because the Hard rappers' lyrics are conscientious about being of/for the real lives and attitudes of recognizable, if alien, persons. Here's where it's a level up from mere spectacle: ideology in Hard rap is always informed by incident or named condition. This makes rap not only better than Punk, but way scarier. Serious Hard raps afford white listeners genuine, horse's-mouth access to the life-and-death plight and mood of an American community on the genuine edge of im-/explosion, an ugly new sub-nation we've been heretofore conditioned to avoid, remand to the margins, not even see except through certain carefully abstract, attenuating filters.\n\nFor outsiders, rap is hard to dissect, easy to move to. The command is: dance, don't understand; participate, don't manipulate. Rap is a fortress protected by the twin moats of talk and technology. The first is that nu style of speak--the \"dialect drug,\" De La Soul calls it--that rappers fashion from jive and disseminate through record stores to all of us. Some in-words, like \"fly,\" meaning \"finelooking,\" have been in coin since the beginning, now venerable as Old English because they turn up on Grandmaster Flash cuts from '82. Others, like \"dead presidents,\" rap for $$, are either coming into or going out of currency, depending on when you read this. Rap, a club language, has myriad ways to describe one's own or others' looks. \"Fly\" is how a man digs a woman. One would never describe oneself as \"fly,\" even when cataloguing one's own attractions (done more in rap than anyplace except perhaps Village Voice personals). \"Fresh\" means irresistibly stylish, oft-modified by \"funky,\" \"crazy,\" or \"stoopid,\" predominantly used to convey the fly-ness of things other than women, including oneself or one's rap, which two concepts rappers, like schizophrenics, can't always keep separate in their heads. \"Dope\" means \"def,\" and \"def\" means crazy funky stoopid fresh. Synonyms include: the shit, the It, the cool, the thang, the word, the grooviest, the categorical imperative, die weltanschung, the that-which-Potter-Stewart-would-know-if-he-saw. A def rapper is so style-defining as to make the stylish mere copycats. To be def is to rap to the beat of a different drum machine--not seeking solitude, but rather confident that others will follow. The def rapper MC's a def rap, which rap def-ly tells of its own (and the rapper's) def-ness--so def, as MC/manager, entrepreneur Russell Rush Simmons brags, that it had to be on a label called Def Jam.\n\nRap celebrates power, equating strength with style, and style with the \"I\" in \"Individuality.\" Rappers \"dis\"--dismiss--the styleless, faceless. To \"ill\" is to be weak or wrong; to \"bite\" is to thieve another's dope beat. And only the ill would bite.\n\nEarly remastered pop was the first fake music ever, since what the record buyer of '63 experienced as Aural Event on his turntable couldn't happen live. Rock began to become an Illusion of Event which technology made possible; rock became more like the movies, starting down a long road at the end of which was MTV.\n\nNot that this kept Phil Spector up nights. The gurus of the studio had fatter fish to clean, for the new freedom to shape sound had come at a price. With each magnetic jump from live, as tape was made of tapes which were themselves tapes of tapes, the hiss and crackle of interference multiplied. Dual high-bias media with 2 units each of sonic garbage per 10,000 units of Elvis Presley, retaped on similar 2-units-per-10,000 tape, became 4 units of hiss; retaped, 8; then 16; then 32. As the sound got fuller, it decayed.\n\nThe solution was a breakthrough called multi-tracking--using recorders that could capture and play back on 2 (as in stereo), 4 (as in '67's then-ear-shattering Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band), 12, 16, and today 24 parallel tracks, eliminating the hiss of transference from one machine to the next. Rhythms, melodies, harmonies could all be captured on separate tracks, allowing the performer or producer to mix and listen and re-mix, adding vocals or lead instrument on yet another track. Rap Edisons like Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa began as party DJs, not musicians. Their wiring of twin turntables to a mixer, allowing them to \"stack\" the sound of two different records while rapping into a mike, was a kind of crude, extemporaneous multitracking. Technological loops like those in the NASA-esque studios of CBS and Polygram were now in the hands of the homeboys. Carter was President. The Bee Gees, with five Top-Ten hits in twelve months, were king.\n\nDigital recording, the science dividing Rjam's Tam-Tam on tape from Tam-Tam as heard \"live\" is a technology that converts music to codes or \"digits.\" The codes are \"read\" by a computer, one combining sophisticated sound-to-code translation hardware with a number-crunching COS and a high-response synthesizer, at speeds of 40,000 digits per second and up. The recorded sounds, reduced to numbers, can be shaped, mangled, muffled, amplified, and even canonized.*** Hardware then translates the digits, as read and altered, back into sound, which can itself be recorded on multitrack and combined with yet more sounds. The result: hiss-free reproduction on an infinity of tracks, each of which can itself be manipulated infinitely.\n\nDigital recording, part of the 80s sea-change in how pop gets made, divides the responsibility for the final song more or less equally between the performer, the engineer at the mixing board, the producer who coordinates the multi-tracking and mixing process, and the electronic hardware that actually \"makes\" the music we buy. The latest synthesizers**** produce notes from pure electric current instead of electronically amplified vibrations, with voltage-meters rather than hands or feet determining everything from key to pitch to timbre to \"attack-delay envelope\" (another non-rap term, denoting the microtimed, counterpoised quality of a note's duration, how a note's sound/quaver-structure as it builds is different from its sound and structure as it fades--the manipulation of a piano's foot-pedals, for example, affects the delay component of each note and chord's envelope). The Kurzweil 250, a state-of-the-art system, is a 1-?track/12,018-note synthesizer linked by software to an Apple MacIntosh Plus, which serves as an exhaustive library of digitized sound. The Kurzweil could put all of culture in a blender--take Janet Leigh's Cremora-curdling scream from Psycho, store it in the Mac, program the synth such that an F# will be reproduced as Janet Leigh's F# scream, then play \"We Shall Overcome\" as if screamed by Janet Leigh; store this; treat similarly Bach's St. Matthew's Passion, except with vast choruses of screaming Janet Leighs, then \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" then \"Twist and Shout\" (by the Isleys, not the Beatles), all as screams; then replay the four as one horrific jumble, or select amidst the jumble; and then whatever you came up with in the final, painstakingly re-mixed mix you could play backwards. And call that \"finished.\" Or never finish. It's like holding music at gunpoint. You can make it do--or do to you --whatever you can think of. Whim is the only limit.\n\nBasically we decided we were into rap because, even media-hype aside, this music had some kind of hard edge to it. Date of composition here is July '89. Think back. This last has been a fiscal year in which Madonna's \"back on top,\" in which covers of classic covers of classic tunes are themselves covered and then climb corporate charts, in which Rod Stewart's out of cryogenics and back on top.... MTV's ceased to be anything but a long commercial for itself and the interests of corporate labels; Bobby McFerrin makes a platinum mint and then several commercial jingles out of a burbled synth-reggae invitation to \"Be Happy,\" a song that has the same verbal-pre-packaging feel as \"Where's the Beef?\"\n\nThis last year heavy metal's fake-Satanist male models accounted for 1/2 of total U.S. record sales; U2 filmed a $20,000,000 homage to their own self-righteousness and Bono's ever more ill-disguised megalomania. A year when even good old REM finally went corporate-pop with Green, when good old Springsteen trashed his bride, when as modest and nascent a talent as Tracy Chapman earned cymbal-crashing critical raves for her competent, updated frappe of Baez and Armatrading, so desperate were pop critics and consumers for any voice at once comprehensible and even remotely fresh. Just not a notable pop year at all. Except in rap. Rap appears in the famished late 80s as potentially a genuine musical Scene the way early jazz, rock, the Summer of Love, folk/protest, god even the way New Wave and Punk were \"Scenes\"--the S-word here simultaneously meaning: something new to look at; something loud and upsetting (\"Oh please, Veronica, let's not have a Scene!\"); and, best, an identifiable set of places in time where large forces meet, marry and beget. Whether by virtue or default, rap is pretty much what there is to like right now, if you want to regard today's pop as anything more than covert jingles in 4/4-time. In our opinion.\n\nBut so the point is we enjoy it. Plus we've developed some theses about why serious rap is important, both as art-for-own-sake and as a kind of metaphor-with-larynx for a subbed-culture unique in its distillation of the energy and horror of the American present.\n\nRap is expanding gas-like through the 80s' dry time, growing from house party schtick, gang anthem, a small-label fad with the sort of pop lifespan you measure with eggtimers--then somehow, when we weren't looking, into Scene, movement, On The Air--finally, in the last 24 months, assuming the fecund role of genuine Genre. Exploding into subspecies now faster than you can track. There's now Dub's mix of rap and reggae, House's mix of rap and 70s-, huge-afro'd funk, Acid House's psychedelic hip-hop. There is black rap for white mass-consumption (Tone Loc, Run?DMC), black rap for local set and -house consumption (countless local stars and wanna-be's in every large city), ultra-black rap superstars for the whole marginal Nation inside (Heavy D, Public Enemy, Big Daddy Kane), white rap for white masses (the execrable Beastie Boys). There is Hispanic, Salsa-influenced rap out of different West Coast barrios, rap fused with West Indian or Islamic traditional music in Digital Underground, Eric B. and Rakim, and others, or fused with oh-so-danceable R&B in the new \"jack swing\" offshoot (Bobby Brown, MC Hammer); even gay and bohemian young urban Bs have their trendsetters in Teddy Riley and Guy, De La Soul, Kwabe. Etc. etc.***** A major impediment to sampling this Scene is the kaleidoscopic fury with which the Scene itself is changing. If you're reading this in print it's already dated.\n\nAnd the rap world's vitality is one of replacement as well as variety, allowing the genre to remain fresh, as band after band is seduced into the \"real\" music biz. This Scene is hydra-like. Almost the moment a rap artist like Run-DMC or L. L. Cool J \"breaks through\" into major-market mix appeal, MTV's land of corporate bankability, certain reactions within the urban underground that spawned them can almost always be observed. The breakthrough band's B-boys themselves are without qualms about the pop bigtime: after all, they've been rapping all along about their entitlement to money and status, about the inevitable rewards of their freshness and unbiteable voice. Their postbreakthrough raps tend all often to become celebrations of their new wealth and fame, of the now-enhanced authority of their \"Message\"--though it's hard to feature Public Enemy rapping about a Black-Militant renaissance, about revolution and American apocalypse, while lily-white CBS Records pays them millions for the distribution rights to just such exhortations to cut corporate throats.\n\nNevertheless, back in the underground Scene, the breakthrough band's tight set of original fans tends to hang loyal, to await feverishly \"their\" crew's spots on the same music TV they love to dis. In short, there are comparatively few of the accusations of selling out that accompanied a similarly oxymoronic coopting phenomenon in late-60s protest rock. Which if you think about it, is passing strange. The white mainstream Other against which serious rap aligns and defines itself makes the 60s \"Establishment\" too look downright benign.\n\nOur opinion, then, from a distance: not only is a serious rap serious poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the Great 80s Market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we've been encouraged sadly to write off,6 it's quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today. \"Real\" (viz. academic) U.S. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocab, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred and (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn't get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers, doesn't get to move or inform more than a fraction of that readership (most of the moved being poets themselves), doesn't generate revenue for much of anyone save the universities to whom the best PhD-poets rent their names and time ... and especially does not inspire a whole culture's youth to try to follow in their Connecticut-catalogue brogans' prints. Because of rap's meteoric rise, though, you've got poor kids, tough kids, \"underachievers,\" a \"lost generation\"... more young people--ostensibly forever turned off \"language\" by TV, video games and low U.S.D.E. budgets--more of these kids hunched over notebooks on their own time, trying to put words together in striking and creative ways, than the U.S.A. has probably ever had at one time. That few of these will become \"stars\" matters far less than the grim stats about, say, the tiny percentage of playground basketball phenoms who actually ride sports out and up from subclass status: the same verbal skills and enthusiasms rap values (and values enough to let rap-dissing stand symbolically for fighting or killing) can obviously be applied in mainstream-approved, \"productive\" ways--G.E.D.'s college, Standard Written English ...perhaps someday even ad-copywriting!\n\nBut is this wildfire of urban rap ambition raging around converted four-car garages like North Dorchester's RJam's in spite of the genre's near-disciplinary prosodic restrictions, or because of them? Can't really tell. Probably doesn't matter. The fact remains that, were \"important poetry\" presently defined in terms of what makes important art important in a Supply-Side democracy (popularity, effect, the separation of fan from his cash), staid journals like Poetry and American Poetry Review would be featuring some number of fade-cut, multiple-earring'd authors' photos in each issue; and highbrow public readings would always carry their back row fraction of bangers ready to \"listen rude\" to Wilbur and Levertov and Ashbery, just as e.g Rimbaud and Pound did to their own contemporaries ... to the delight and invigoration of a time's poetry...\n\n... And even just the prospected fantasy of seeing Public Enemy's be-clocked Flavor Fav and like a Jorie Graham or Amy Clampitt sitting down over beer and Celestial Seasonings to hash out the debate over line-breaks in dactylic pentameter, a very serious young homeboy in Italian silk and pentagonal shades serving as interpreter is enough to make us hereby officially lobby for the admission of rhyme's renaissance--at least under the stringent rhythmic demands rap has forced on rhyme-as-form--to the cold corridors of Serious Appreciation.\n\nUnlike the mostly docile poetry and fiction of the late 80s, though, rap's own quality, the def freshness of the MC's bit, is set up to be judged primarily in the context of what it is against. In case you thought we forgot, rap is first of all a movement in rock music, and thus the time-honored requirement is that the rap Scene set itself very consciously athwart those circumstances and forces whose enormity is required by all rock 'n roll to justify one of its essential roles, rebellion-against. Except now watch the objects of the rebellion alter, spread, grow in urgency--from the 50s' parents and principals, homework, hot rods, the sweet hurt of teen love, to the urban 80s, police, violent death, homelessness, the lure of ecstatic drugs that dehumanize weaponry, fatherlessness, the animal emptiness of sex w/o love, the almost Trilaterally sinister White Establishment (\"THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBLE THE GOVERNMENT'S. . . \"), Everyone Else: life as a series of interruptions from an angry slumber about what the electric voices say you must have and the human voices say you may not, about the betrayal of the past, of the promises exacted by Carmichael, X, and the now-formal martyrdom of King.\n\nSegregation may affect their hearts and minds, Earl Warren warned, as Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan, both alumni of Boston's old separate-but-awful schools, bear loud witness. Now, 40 years after X disgustedly quit a racist high school and began a career as a kind of be-bop gang-banger, 35 years after Brown v. Board of Education invented integration, 15 years after Morgan v. Hennigan brought Brown to Boston, North Dorchester is worse and its schools aren't better. A former United States Secretary of Education converts to Drug Czar, symbolizing a national change of mind: now drugs, not poor schools (and certainly not the American apartheid of which segregated schools were but one facet), is our root \"innercity\" problem. Tam-Tam's Boston is strangely less hopeful than the notoriously segregated pre-Hennigan city, perhaps because before Hennigan reformers could promise that segregation was why things were so bad. Segregation was blame's bullseye: abolish the bullseye, and blame for the estrangement of the races flies everywhere, hitting the cops, or the courts, or the teachers, or the taught, or what's taught. There's even a rap--B.D.P.'s \"Why is That?\"--blaming our miseries on the failure of the schools to \"teach black kids to be black.\"\n\nBut everything the white rock listener pays to enjoy is black-begotten. If today's Top?40 environment seems bleak or befouled, imagine the present mainstream without its sweetest sourcewaters, without the King-Waters-King Blues trinity, the Brownian soul, the backbeat, cut time, blue notes, funky French curves of sax and brass, the guitar solo, call-and-response, the Cold Medina or Lucky Powder, those lithely syncopated quintets in pomade and linen suits, the single hand in the white glove holding Pepsi aloft in the shadow of accidental flames.... Black music is American pop's breath and bread; and we, as both born audience and born salesmen, know it.\n\nSo maybe it's them. Them. Maybe we're approaching an enforced fork in the musical road where the white-run entertainment industry will have to pack up what it's taken and go seek its fortune on the backs of new minorities. Maybe, in serious rap, the extreme new insulation of the black sound is not only intentional but preplanned, part of a neo-Nationalist agenda, the hermetic new Scene's tight circle more like something large and coiled than something small and flat.\n\nYou may now be getting some hazy idea of the sorts of really quite scary possibilities with which the rap we like is replete. And, hazier, of how complicated this stuff of sampler-from-outside can be. What's remained passing strange, for use, is the vague threat's appeal. The unease and ambivalence with which the rare white at the window loves rap renders that love no less love. Whence the fear, though, is really no matter. For look at the world, at the masses we're part of. At what you look at closest. The plain 80s data is that, whereas love, devotion, passion seem only to divide, it's fear and strangeness that bind crowds, fill halls, unite Us, somehow, as audience, under the great tent.\n\n*'Hip-hop' is an older synonym, coined by Rap pioneer, Kool Herc, to describe the heavily danceable Jamaican scatting he introduced between records at the huge South Bronx block parties he and other new-Scene celebrities, like Jazzy Five and former Black Spades leader, Afrika Bambaataa, could turn into late-70s frenzies of Breakdance (both music and dance a self-conscious reaction against the glittered unreality of downtown Disco).\n\n**Except but now hey kids! thanks to AT&T you can now speak directly to Ice T and hear his philosophy of life by phone! 1-900-907-9111. \"Chill out with Ice T,\" the rapper adrape in military hardware and ammunition says on MTV, \"I'm just waiting on you to call me,\" pointing at the camera and then himself lest the audience get at all confused. \"Don't forget to ask your parent's permission first\" (white corporate voice-over)--$2.00 first minute, etc. etc.\n\n***\"Canon\" being another non-jive rap term, meaning the division of a single sequence of sound into two or more repeating sound-sequences, like a vocal round.\n\n**** ... themselves the heirs of a long, 20th-century evolutionary process, from the playe-?piano to the 20s Oncles Martenot and Theremin and Trautonium (crude electronic instruments big in France), to Pierre Schaeffer's musique concrete in '48, to the first Electronic Music Synthesizer invented by engineers at RCA in the 50s to the inauguration of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in '59, to Robert Moog's '64 development of the Moog 55, the first emitter of amplified \"blurps, fwipps, simps, twings, and schlonks\" to be commercially produceable. Walter/Wendy Carlos used a Moog 55 for his/her '68 Switched-On Bach, an album that did more than anything to popularize synthesized sound.\n\n***** Note how the ecstatic force's movement extends beyond sound into dance-Chicago-based house-dancing is very different from Coast-based rap-dancing, while both are distinct from the Quaalude sway a De La Soul's lazy complexity invites--and beyond dance into urban haute couture itself. The \"cameo\" or \"fade,\" that troubling cyberpunk flat-top haircut favored by Carl Lewis and Grace Jones but popularized by the group Cameo's rapping Larry Blackmon, has now become less a haircut than a sculptural statement: words, logos, slogans and complex signs razored into the rigid anvil of hair that is, according to the Voice, \"the most culturally conscious unisex hairstyle since the afro.\" The standard 80s-rap uniform--sideways baseball cap or Kangol, ropey chains, acetate warmup and unlaced hightops--\"...now symbolizes a cruder, more casual era,\" and is diffracting into a rap-House-gay-jackswing look replete with polka-dot ties, loose pleated twills, and expensive dance-loafers or British \"moon boots,\" a combination Ricky Ricardo-Frank Sinatra dapper that now befits a Scene with the dignity, silliness and pull of real Genre. Plus don't forget that just one big change in street and school fashions means millions and millions in garment revenue--even more $$ once the white mainstream, as is its won't, follows in the cutting edge's media-delayed wake.\n\n****** \"We've lost a whole generation to their own culture out here,\" rues an LAPD Assistant Commissioner in a 14 May '89 Boston TV news special on the national Wa-?On gangs, drugs, crime, Others\u20269Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/5110617", "artist_names": "Genius", "full_title": "May 2020 Singles Release Calendar by\u00a0Genius", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/97fc77fbf594e6ceb5f846c749d730bd.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/97fc77fbf594e6ceb5f846c749d730bd.1000x1000x1.png", "id": 5110617, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 498964, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1652369786, "path": "/Genius-may-2020-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "pyongs_count": 5, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Genius-may-2020-singles-release-calendar-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2020, "month": 5, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "May 2020", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "May. 2020", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/97fc77fbf594e6ceb5f846c749d730bd.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/97fc77fbf594e6ceb5f846c749d730bd.1000x1000x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 40473}, "title": "May 2020 Singles Release Calendar", "title_with_featured": "May 2020 Singles Release Calendar", "updated_by_human_at": 1667026332, "url": "https://genius.com/Genius-may-2020-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/204611", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/822a5f872a1fcfe377695dc0046c6bc6.900x176x1.jpg", "id": 204611, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0ca83e3130e1303a7f78ba351e3091cd.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Genius", "slug": "Genius", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Genius", "iq": 77869}, "artist": "Genius", "lyrics": "May 2020 Singles Release Calendar Lyrics5/1\n11:11 - \"Me, Chanel & Jameson\"\nAazar & Yung Felix - \"One Night\" ft.

Some people may say that some heroes have nothing to do with each other but they all go through the same steps some may just be better then other but they still go through they same thing . heros like luke skywalker from star wars and wendy from peter pan but I say wendys better.\nLuke Skywalker is considered a hero in the story star wars because first he is in a unusual living with his aunt and uncle then he receives a mysterious message from a princess ,  After his aunt and uncle are killed by Imperial troops, Luke sees no option but to travel with Kenobi away from Tatooine then Luke\u2019s journey begins on the Millennium Falcon with his new friends Kenobi, the droids R2-D2 and Han Solo, They head to the Alderaan system where they expect to find the princess. But Luke and friends discover that the princess, Leia, is in one of the prison cells.  They create a plan to rescue her, and manage to all escape on the Falcon. Therefore luke is considered a hero for saving the princess .\nWendy from peter pan is a hero and he adventure starts when she  is told by her parents and aunt that she is too immature and that it is time for her to grow up then later . One Peter Pan visited Wendy The two became friends right  away Later he became her mentor because Peter Pan asked Wendy to run away with him to his home in Never Land. And then she meets the kids that are there then she helps them and saves them from all the pirates on ever land so wendy is a hero because she saved the kids .\nWendy is a better hero  because i feel like it\u2019s more realistic to help kids then to help princesses because there are not many actual princesses now a days , also because it may  persuade people to help kids with what they may need specially in our modern world with many orphans , poor kids , staving kids and many other things that kids now a days have to go through so I believe that Wendy is a much better hero then Luke Skywalker .\nIn conclusion all heros go through the same step just that in similar ways. all stores have this steps they may just not be clear you may have to look for a while but the steps are there . just like in peter pan some steps took a while to figure out but when you find it , it all  makes sense . also in star wars most steps were not so obvious as others. but at the end you will se how amlost every storie you look at with a heo they willl have the3 same steps .Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/6550197", "artist_names": "The Mighty Mighty Bosstones", "full_title": "Lonely Boy by\u00a0The\u00a0Mighty Mighty Bosstones", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/b8e17e76d33e3612d159febcf854cbed.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b8e17e76d33e3612d159febcf854cbed.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 6550197, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 321054, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1620400971, "path": "/The-mighty-mighty-bosstones-lonely-boy-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-mighty-mighty-bosstones-lonely-boy-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2021, "month": 5, "day": 7}, "release_date_for_display": "May 7, 2021", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "May. 7, 2021", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/b8e17e76d33e3612d159febcf854cbed.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b8e17e76d33e3612d159febcf854cbed.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Lonely Boy", "title_with_featured": "Lonely Boy", "updated_by_human_at": 1620400976, "url": "https://genius.com/The-mighty-mighty-bosstones-lonely-boy-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/40494", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e5fa649160d95170a36906653600e50b.345x230x1.jpg", "id": 40494, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e5fa649160d95170a36906653600e50b.345x230x1.jpg", "index_character": "m", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "The Mighty Mighty Bosstones", "slug": "The-mighty-mighty-bosstones", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-mighty-mighty-bosstones"}, "artist": "The Mighty Mighty Bosstones", "lyrics": "Lonely Boy Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThe Old Colony Railway Company\nOn the Plymouth Kingston Line\nLoneliness, what have you done to me?\nI was leaving the city behind\nBound with a reckless abandon\nNot too often found these days\nIn an hour or so I'd be standing there by the bay\n\n[Chorus]\nI grew up lonesome, I was a lonely boy\nI went down to Kingston when the weekend began\nOh, what a lonely boy\nI had no one, I went down anyway\nI went down to Kingston when the weekend began\nOh, what a lonely boy\n[Verse 2]\nTo the river, the pond and the hill\nMy grandfath\u0435r's trailer is there\nOnly lon\u0435liness can and it will\nForsake you and take you somewhere\nIt took me down to the beach\nIt took me down to the shore\nFor thirty or forty weekends, possibly more\n\n[Chorus]\nI grew up lonesome, I was a lonely boy\nI went down to Kingston when the weekend began\nOh, what a lonely boy\nI had no one, I went down anyway\nI went down to Kingston when the weekend began\nOh, what a lonely boy\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe North Abington Station and stop\nShe sat down and I stole a glance\nNervously she tried to talk\n\"Are you going to Kingston by chance?\"\nI said I was going alone\nAnd she said that she's never been\nThen we both agreed that we wouldn't let loneliness win\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI grew up lonesome, I was a lonely boy\nI went down to Kingston when the weekend began\nOh, what a lonely boy\nI had no one, I went down anyway\nI went down to Kingston when the weekend began\nOh, what a lonely boy\nSo lonesome, I was a lonely boy\nI went down to Kingston when the weekend began\nOh, what a lonely boy\nI had no one, I went down anyway\nI went down to Kingston when the weekend began\nOh, what a lonely boy\n\n[Outro]\nOh, what a lonely boy\nOh, what a lonely boyEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 59, "api_path": "/songs/4510817", "artist_names": "URLtv (Ft.

Deja vu again?\n\nKATSUYA: Now Mt. Iwato of Araya...What is Tatsuya trying to do?\n\nNATE: It appears that Suou's purpose is to make you realize...or\nremember something, Ms. Amano. Do you have any ideas?  I am interested,\nsince I've gotten involved in this.\n\nELLEN: Perhaps Tatsuya wants you to remember something, Ms. Amano? It\nappears to be that way...\n\nULALA: Did you hear what that old woman said?  Looks like something\nhappened here.\n\nOLD WOMAN: W-What just happened...?

The time I've spent with you didn't\nallow...And so, I may have subconsciously wanted to escape...from\nmyself, Nate Nanjo...\n\nNATE: But, now it's different.  I will do what I think is right.  As\nNate Nanjo...\n\n(ELLEN'S ROUTE)\n\nELLEN: The promise...we made it...\n\nELLEN: I-I had been hiding my true feelings...I really didn't want you\nto go...I waited to be by your side...From that time on, I had forgotten\nabout my dream of becoming a woman who's true to herself...I was afraid\nof rejection...The reason why I can't come close to my dream and my\nsmile is so cold...It's all because of my cowardly heart...\n\n(Tatsuya flicks his lighter)\n\nTATSUYA: This is the power of the spring...If you're going to turn\nback...do it now...I won't stop you...\n\n(Tatsuya goes on ahead.

Are you saying that Amano's visions are all\nmemories of a different reality...?\n\nKATSUYA: Are you saying that Ms. Amano and Tatsuya Sudou came from the\nsame reality as you!?\n\nTATSUYA: That's not entirely true...Sudou was truly a person of \"This\nSide\"...He was told by \"him\" of the existence of the \"Other Side\" and\nwas only being used...\n\nULALA: So what do you mean!? It's not like Ma-ya came from that world\neither, right?  Why does Ma-ya only have the memory of this \"Other\nSide\"? None of us have it!\n\nTATSUYA: There are many reasons...I don't think you should know any\nmore...\n\nKATSUYA: Idiot...! As if we can back out after all this!\n\nTATSUYA: If you continue, something bad may happen!\n\n*MAYA: Tatsuya...I have a right to know.*\n\nTATSUYA: Fine...A picture is worth a thousand words...\n\n(Tatsuya goes on ahead.

Forever, the five of us all\ntogether...we all believed that...But Maya had to leave town for family\nreasons...We couldn't bear that, so we locked Maya in the shrine...And\nthen Sudou set it aflame...We thought Maya had died, so we were\nscared...And each of us suppressed the memory...Jun remembered that and\nbecame a Joker. Controlled by \"him\", he tried to end the world in\nexchange for the ideal evolution.\n\n\nREALITY\n\nULALA: His story...It's just like what we're going through, don't you\nthink...?\n\nKATSUYA: Who is that \"him\" that controlled Jun...?\n\nTATSUYA: His appearence was that of Jun's father, but inside was\ncompletely different... Crawling Chaos...Nyarlathotep...He is the being\nthat stands opposite to Philemon...The shadow that lurks deep within\nman's heart, toying with destiny...\n\nTATUSYA: He wants to bring the same chaos to This Side as the Other\nSide. The New World Order is just one of his pawns.\n\nBAOFU: Hey, what do you mean...causing the same thing to happen?\n\nTATSUYA:......You'll find out.\n\n(He goes on ahead. Talk to your members.)\n\nULALA: There's a boss behind the New World Order...?  And that guy's in\neach and everyone of us!?\n\nBAOFU: The ideal-collecting Masquerade, and the Kegare-collecting New\nWorld Order, huh...Serizawa's right, the situations are similar...\n\nKATSUYA: The being that stands opposite to Philemon...? The archetype of\nexistential destruction...? If such a thing does exist, it is well\nbeyond our comprehension...The shadow of mankind...\n\nNATE: Nyarlathotep...!? It wasn't merely Guido's Persona?\n\nELLEN: Nyarlathotep...Crawling Chaos...The Faceless God...He is not just\na Persona?\n\n\nFINAL SPRING OF MIRRORS\n\nFLASHBACK: NYARLATHOTEP'S LAIR\n\n(This shows Tatsuya, Maya, Lisa, Eikichi, and Jun at Nyarlathotep's\nlair, which looks identical to Philemon's Lair.  Philemon and\nNyarlothotep appear.)\n\nPHILEMON: Going soft after playing the father?  Crawling\nChaos...Nyarlathotep.  Now you should understand what I said.\n\nNAYRLATHOTEP: Ha...It may be true these people can give us good results\nfor our research...\n\nGINKO: What are you saying, Philemon!?\n\nPHILEMON: We are the orgin of people's hearts...The Collective\nUnconsciousness is just one side of that coin...We've watched the\naffairs of man from here...I direct the strong of will, and he, the\nCrawling Chaos, drags the weak to Hell.  It is all in order to determine\nif people's hearts, which are in conflict, can arise as something\ncomplete...You all have displayed that possiblity.  If there are more\nhumans like you, humans can one day become a perfect existence...\n\nTATSUYA: Everything...This is all part of your experiment!?\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: You should show more respect to me. This one can only\nobserve.  However...I am different.\n\n(A woman that looks like Maya Okamura from Seven Sisters High School\nappears and stabs Maya with a spear. Maya then falls to the ground.)\n\nMAYA: .......?\n\nTATSUYA: Maya!!\n\n(Tatsuya and co. rush over to Maya's side and Lisa uses her Persona to\nheal Maya and Okamura teleports to Nyarlathotep's side.)\n\nEIKICHI: Dammit! Ginko! Use your powers!\n\nGINKO: I'm trying!! But...but...The blood won't stop!!  Why...Why won't\nmy spell work!? Philemon!?\n\nPHILEMON: Nyarlathotep...You spread the legend of the Sacred Spear, for\nthis...?\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Blood poured endlessly from the body of God's son when\npierced with that spear. It's the legend..or, \"rumor\" that you humans\nhave continued to tell for some 2000 years.  Quuite effective, isn't\nit?\n\nMAYA:.....\n\nMAYA:.......\n\nTATSUYA: \"Hurry up and forget about me?\"...Don't be ridiculous...!!! How\ncould I forget...!!?\n\nMAYA:.....\n\nTATSUYA: Yeah...I'll grab it...You taught me...I'll grab hold of my\ndream..so..\n\n(Maya dies)\n\nTATSUYA: ......Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Ha ha...Should people be able to realize their dreams?\nForsaking one of the same name, lost in illusion..This is this woman's\ndream.  I will make the human's dream of destruction come true!!\n\n\nREALITY\n\nTATSUYA: Do you remember now...?\n\n(Maya falls to the ground)\n\nMAYA: ...........\n\nKATSUYA: What happened...after that...?\n\nTATSUYA: Maya, with the name of Maya Okamura, died...The prophecy\nfullfilled...The whole world destroyed...leaving only Sumaru behind...\n\n(Everyone is shocked.)\n\nTATSUYA: In the World of Collective Unconsciousness, where we fought\nhim, strong beliefs became reality...By resetting our meeting 10 years\nago, we created another reality in exchange for the truths and memories\nuntil then...\n\nBAOFU: So that's this reality...\n\nTATSUYA: Maya told us to forget about her...To accept everything and\nmove on...But we couldn't stand it...That's why we made this reality, to\ntrade for our memories and we escaped here...Hanging on to a faint\nhope..to remember....\n\nULALA: .........\n\nTATSUYA: A hope like that couldn't happen...My freinds that meshed in\nThis Side forgot about the Other Side, and each other...But...I...\n\nBAOFU: So that's why Amano and that Jun kid don't remember about the\nOther Side...\n\nNATE: No wonder we natives of \"This Side\" don't have a memory of the\n\"Other Side\"...\n\nELLEN: We don't have a memory of the \"Other Side\", because we are\nnatives of \"This Side\"...\n\nTATSUYA: But that could change...\"He\" said I was \"the Paradox\"...This\nreality exists on the concept of the resetting of us five...If we all\nregain our memories, the distortion between the two worlds will\ngrow...And this world will cease to exist...\n\n(Everyone is shocked.)\n\nTATSUYA: I don't want Maya to be involved anymore...I'm sure you\nunderstand now...Please stay out of this...\n\nBAOFU: What were we talking about Serizawa?\n\nULALA: I don't know. Shouldn't the adults be the ones fooling the kids?\n\nKATSUYA: No...It's about adults taking responsibility for children's\nactions...\n\nTATSUYA (shocked): ............(mad) You tricked me...\n\n*MAYA: Dummy...! Look at you!*\n\n(Maya slaps Tatsuya and everyone is surprised.)\n\nTATSUYA: I-I...\n\n(Maya slaps Tatsuya again.)\n\nTATSUYA: I'm sorry...I understand...please don't get mad...\n\n(NATE'S ROUTE)\n\nNATE: Ha...I guess my work is done here...You're surrounded by good\nadults boy...You had better appreciate what they do for you.\n\nKATSUYA: What are you going to do...?\n\nNATE: I'm going to walk a path I believe in. I'll do all I can to end\nchaos in the city.\n\nBAOFU: Heh...If we're both still alive, let's knock one back together...\n\n(Nate nods his head and the screen goes black. Nate has left the group\nand Tatsuya joins.)\n\n(ELLEN'S ROUTE)\n\nELLEN: I guess this is it for my part...Tatsuya...now, it's a fight for\nyou and all...Take really good care of Ms. Amano.\n\nULALA: What are you going to do, Ellen?\n\nELLEN: With Nate, I'll help the people in this city. I will keep my\npromise. For myself.\n\nULALA: Your smile looks better! You'll be just fine. Good luck!\n\n(Ellen nods her head and the screen goes black. Ellen has left the group\nand Tatsuya joins.)\n\nCITY MAP: RENGEDAI\n\nKATSUYA: We've wasted so much time...We'd better hurry and catch up with\nTatsuzou, before it's too late.\n\nBAOFU: Kandori and that woman said that bastard headed for\nTorifune...how can we find it?\n\nTATSUYA: They created Torifune with a rumor, so if you follow the rumor\nabout the underground, you should find it...\n\n\nGATTEN SUSHI\n\nTATSUYA: Maya. Do you remember this is Eikichi's house? Eikichi...he's\nnot here...\n\nULALA: You must be puzzled Ma-ya.  I mean, you're dead on the Other\nSide..Well...You might not have any feeling of reality though.\n\n\nSUMARU PRISON\n\nTTSUYA:: A live house...I haven't touched a guitar for awhile.\n\n(The key to add Tatsuya to the Flamenco Contact.)\n\nTATSUYA: This is...the first place we met the Joker.  Not the same Joker\nfrom \"This Side\". ..I'm talking about my...our friend.\n\n\nHIRASAKA SATOMI TADASHI\n\nULALA: Hmm, I wonder if Satomi Tadashi was popular on the \"Other Side\"\ntoo? Hey Ma-ya, let's ask.\n\nTATSUYA: Satomi Tadashi...? I'm not sure if it was popular, but I did go\nthere often.\n\n\nIZAKAYA SHIRASHI\n\nTATSUYA: ...Why?...This place is different from the \"Other Side\"... Too\ndifferent!\n\nBAOFU: So this shop differs on the \"Other Side\". He doesn't have to be\nthat shocked, does he?\n\nULALA: So can only Tatsuya know the difference between here and the\n\"Other Side\"? ...Ah, can you tell too, Ma-ya?\n\nKATSUYA: I'm sure it's not as if only this shop is different from the\n\"Other Side\".  Maybe he just hasn't noticed everything else.\n\n\nKASU HIGH ROOFTOP\n\nKATSUYA: On the \"Other Side\" I wasn't able to help...But not here.  As\nthe brother of Tatsuya, as protector of Justice, I will aid you!\n\nMALE STUDENT: Did you watch TV today?...Wang Long fortune telling is\nsaying the pole shift is caused by New World Order?...What should we do?\n\nYASUO: You don't know anything, do you?... First off, it's \"Did you\nwatch the news on TV today\", not \"Did you watch TV?\" ... The outside\nworld has nothing to do with us... Our wolrd consists of just \"school\".\nOur worth as humans is decided here...\n\n\nYUMEZAKI SATOMI TADASHI\n\nULALA: Tatsuya just told me about a good diet food.  He knows someone\nwho knows a lot about that stuff!\n\n\nMU CONTINENT\n\nKATSUYA: I bet you enjoyed gambling on the \"Other Side\" too..I don't\nhave to ask Tatsuya to tell.\n\n\nPEACE DINER\n\nULALA: But I wonder...What am I like on the \"Other Side\"?  Maybe I was a\ncelebrity?\n\nKATSUYA: Judging from that, it seems Tatsuya amd I are not on good terms\nover on the \"Other Side\"\neither...\n\nTATSUYA: I see...Even on This Side she talks like a ninja...I guess it\ncan't be helped.\n\n\nROSA CANDIDA\n\nTATSUYA: That cave was different on the \"Other Side\" as well...Of\ncourse...Because there is no Masquerade here...\n\n\nLUNAR PALACE\n\nKATSUYA: It seems that on the \"Other Side\", this room is the same...Just\nlook at Tatsuya.\n\nTATSUYA: ...Actually, I never planned to come back here\nagain......EVER...\n\n\nSUMARU GENIE\n\nBAOFU: I heard from Tatsuya on the \"Other Side\", that mystic was a\nrumormonger. As I thought, it's slightly different.\n\n\nKUZUNOHA\n\nTATSUYA: The rumor was manipulated on the Other Side. Although I was\nhelped in many other ways, I bet they wouldn't know me... But are prices\nhigher on \"This Side\"?  That Lucky Cat asked for only 100 on the \"Other\nSide\"...\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya and those guys must've been using this place on the\nOther Side like us...However, with a difference of 900 Yen.\n\nBAOFU: Uhhuuuuuh, even on the \"Other Side\"...This ol' man is suspicious\ntoo...Could he already be aware about Tatsuya?\n\nTAMMY: New World Order's goal is an ambitious one.  It was beyodg my\nimagination. Be careful, Ms. Amano.\n\n\nSUBWAY\n\n(Maya and the group enter inside the train and Maya takes the driver\nseat.)\n\nULALA: Maybe they used this subway to transport stuff?  There's food and\nall kinds of stuff.\n\nBAOFU: Hmph, who're they kidding...They set this thing up and tried to\nmake a rumor come true, they must be insane...\n\nKATSUYA: Um, Ms. Amano, are you sure you can drive? Perhaps I should,\ninstead?\n\n(Maya shakes her head no and she starts to drive.  While riding......)\n\nTATSUYA: .......\n\nBAOFU: .....\n\nULALA: Hey Tatsuya I found some drinks, want some?\n\n(Tatsuya shakes his head no and Ulala sits down.)\n\nULALA: Hey, Tatsuya...Something's been bugging me...Why are you the only\none who recalls the \"Other Side\"?\n\nTATSUYA: .....\n\nBAOFU: Don't have to say what you don't want to...Besides...What I want\nto know is what are WE like on the \"Other Side\"?  We were there, right?\n\nTATSUYA: My brother is pretty much the same...Ulala was scammed by a con\nartist...I only know you spread rumors on the net...\n\nBAOFU: So the \"Other Side\" is not that different...\n\nTATSUYA: ..........Is it hard...being an adult?\n\nBAOFU: Huh?\n\nTATSUYA: No...never mind...Forget about it...\n\nBAOFU: What about you?\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\nBAOFU: It's the same...There's nothing good. The pain just keeps\ngrowing...\n\nULALA: ........\n\nKATSUYA / MAYA: ..........\n\nKATSUYA: Hmm...? Ms. Amano, it's a dead end...Please stop.\n\n(Maya stops the train.)\n\nBAOFU: Welcome to the \"Gates of Hell\"...Worry about everything\nlater...You're still young...You got lots of time. That is, if you stay\nalive...\n\n\nSUBWAY CONSTRUCTION SITE:\n\n(Talk to members)\n\nULALA: Adults, huh...? What are adults anyway?\n\nTATSUYA: I guess we have to walk from here...We can't just go back\neasily.  This is our last chance to turn back...\n\n(If you decide to leave)\n\nTATSUYA: Maya...are we going back...?\n\n*MAYA: No, no, it's nothing.*\n\n\nBAOFU'S LAIR (after being in the Subway)\n\nULALA: I was tricked by him on the \"Other Side\" after all. Huh...Just\nlike Ma-ya's flashback...\n\nBAOFU: It seems I was collecting rumors over there too.  Not very\ndifferent from here...At one time I was kinda curious about an alternate\nworld...But it's actually pretty boring.\n\n\nOUTSIDE AMENO TORIFUNE:\n\n(Maya and co. are underground and they see the Ameno Torifune in the\ndistance.)\n\n\nAMENO TORIFUNE CONTROL ROOM\n\n(The scene cuts to the Control Room.  Tatsuzou is standing on a\nplattform and his 4 NWO executives and General Sugawara are right behind\nhim.  Tenchu Soldiers and Scientists are watching him from below.)\n\nTATSUZOU: Tenchu soldiers! Finally , the prophecy of Torifune has come\ntrue! Gozen awaits! All we need to do now is release Joka to cleanse the\nkegare of the world by the hands of the 12 Dragons!!\n\n(The crowd cheers.)\n\nTATSUZOU: We ask! What has human history been up 'til now!!  Various\nreligions! Tribes! Desires! Values! Was the human history laden with\nthese, a history of \"sin\"!!? The masses blessed with material, lost\ntheir ideals. They don't examine themselves or even try to atone for\ntheir sins! We must provide a dream of reconstructing a new future and\ncleanse the rotting world!  This is the \"Punishment\"!!! And the chosen\nones will know!!! The future of salvation stands before us!\n\n(The crowd cheers again and the screen darkens and moves to Sugawara.)\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA: You twisted bastard...\n\n(The screen lightens up again.)\n\nTATSUZOU: Sugawara...\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA: Yessir...\n\nTATSUZOU: I leave the Torifune to you.  We will ascend to Utena with\nGozen.  Prepare the Petit Deva...\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA:  Yessir...it shall be done.\n\nTATSUZOU: Do not worry about your frailty, my freind...Gozen is very\nhappy with your work. Your wish for immortality will be granted.\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA: Ah...! My loyalty has finally been rewarded...\n\nTATSUZOU: Your body might change slightly though...\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA: What was that?\n\n(Tatsuzou and his 4 NWO executives leave.)\n\n\nOUTSIDE THE TORIFUNE\n\nBAOFU: Hmmm...Impressive...\n\nTATSUYA: Well, considering it can fly with a city on top of it, it\nbetter be...\n\nULALA: This is rumored to be a ship of a god or aliens, right...? Don't\nyou think they would've set traps or something?\n\nTATSUYA: This ship, called \"Xibalba\" on the \"Other Side\", makes bad\nthoughts real...You shouldn't think of anything bad.\n\nKATSUYA: How do you know...?\n\nTATSUYA: People's fear...insecurity...hopes...It borrows the form of\nrumors, it is the incarnation of the unconscious world...\n\n(Tatsuya flicks his lighter.)\n\nTATSUYA: I think that's why Philemon said thoughts would become reality\nin the unconscious world...\n\nULALA: Then all we gotta do is think pleasant thoughts...Piece of\ncake...\n\nTATSUYA: No...This is his domain...Don't think anything...\n\n(Maya and co. enter and inside, the whole room is hot and the party is\ngoing crazy.)\n\nKATSUYA: It, It's no use...! The door won't budge!\n\nBAOFU: Yow! Hot!...What's going on!? Serizawa! You thought of something\nbad, didn't you!?\n\nULALA: Yow! Hot!...It, It's not me!!!\n\nTATSUYA: ...I'm sorry. It was something that happened\npreviously......So...I inadvertently...\n\nBAOFU / ULALA: Wh, Wha-----t!?\n\nKATSUYA: It's no use talking about what we thought!  So what happened on\nthe \"Other Side\", Tatsuya!?\n\nTATSUYA: ...I ran.\n\nBAOFU / KATSUYA / ULALA: Ahhhh!?\n\nTATSUYA: \"If you concertrate, even an oven is cool!\" ...Is what Maya\nsaid.\n\n(Maya does her positive gesture and she and Tatsuya go ahead.  Ulala\ntrips and then catches up to them.)\n\nKATSUYA: That's unreasonable...\n\nBAOFU: You gotta be kiddin' me!? Yow! Hot! This is not my idea of fun...\n\n(Baofu and Katsuya catch up with Maya and the others.)\n\nBAOFU / KATSUYA: Uoooooh?!? My sunglasses are melting off my face!!!\n\n(The party enters inside the Torifune.)\n\n\nAMENO TORIFUNE\n\nROOM OF INSULT\n\n(Dead Tenchu Soldiers are lying on the ground in a pool of blood.)\n\nKATSUYA: This is the Tenchu Army. It seems that they were caught in a\ntrap...\n\nULALA: Is this also the work of that \"Nyar-something\"!? ...Isn't it\nweird!?...Why does he kill his own men...!\n\nTATSUYA: It's proof that the New World Order isn't aware of the secret\nof the Torifune...\"He\" thinks of humans as mere pawns...They probaly\ndon't even know of \"his\" existence.\n\n(Talk to Members)\n\nTATSUYA: This ship...him...Neither one anything a human should mess\nwith...\n\nBAOFU: I don't care about the Crawling Chaos, but I'm not letting them\nget away...I'm gonna be the one to kill Tatsuzou...\n\n\nROOM OF DAMNATION\n\nULALA: Hey everyone, wait up a sec...Let's walk a little slower...\n\nBAOFU: Suck it up...If you can't keep up, we're leaving you...\n\nULALA: It can't be helped...I don't walk this much even at work. Isn't\nthere a place to recover?\n\nKATSUYA: It HAS been a while we've been underground. If there was a\nVelvet Room, we could rest there...\n\nTATSUYA: It's there...A Fountain, a Velvet Room...\n\nULALA: Really...!?\n\nKATSUYA: It's awfully suspicious...That Nyarlathotep guy decides wether\nor not to make our thoughts a reality, right? Why does he give things so\nconviently?\n\nTATSUYA: He's playing with us...\n\nBAOFU: I don't know what he's up to, but if I can use it, then I will...\n\n(Baofu and Ulala go in one door while Katsuya goes in one door alone.\nTatsuya begins to sit down and Maya sits next to him.)\n\nMAYA: .........\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\nMAYA: .........\n\n(Tatsuya gets up.)\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\n*MAYA: Th, Thank you for saving me...!*\n\nTATSUYA: This is...the burden of sin...\n\nTATSUYA: You...don't have to worry about me...\n\n(Metal forms of Jun, Eikichi, and Lisa come out from the doors.)\n\nTATSUYA: Wh...at...!?\n\nMETAL LISA: Why...Why is my only Chinyan (darling) next to Maya!?\n\nMETAL EIKICHI: That's cruel...Tatsu...You don't care about us?\n\n(Maya and Tatsuya draw thier weapons.)\n\nTATSUYA: Get back...!!! These are...illusions that my heart called!\n\n(Tatsuya strikes Jun, but Jun is not affected.)\n\nTATSUYA: Damn!\n\nMETAL JUN: Tatsuya...Was the promise to protect Maya a lie...?\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\nMETAL JUN: It's okay...You don't have to suffer by yourself anymore...\n\n(The Metal kids disappear along with Tatsuya and Maya panics. Then the\nothers come out from the doors.)\n\nULALA: Huh...? Where's Tatsuya?\n\n(Maya explains what happened.)\n\nKATSUYA: What did you say...!?\n\nBAOFU: Ch...! We fell for it...Come on! We gotta find him!\n\n(Talk to party members)\n\nULALA: Oh, come on Ma-ya! What were you doing!!!...Wait...I'm the one\nmostly at fault...\n\nBAOFU: They pulled a dirty trick on us..I like his style...Too bad it\nwon't do him any good...\n\nKATSUYA: Damn...Tatsuya's letting his pride get in the way. He's trying\nto carry the weight of the world\non his shoulders...!\n\n\nTORIFUNE B6\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya's still alive...We must hurry...\n\n\nROOM OF GUILT\n\n(The place is Araya Shrine. Tatsuya is tied onto an altar with the Metal\nkids standing over him.)\n\nMETAL EIKICHI: \"We went through a lot, but I'm glad we met again...\"\n\nMETAL LISA: \"Chinyan (darling)...Don't forget about me...\"\n\nMETAL JUN: \"I won't forget...the sin I commited, you or anyone...\"\nTatsuya...Have you forgotten?\n\nTATSUYA: How can I...forget...\n\nMETAL LISA: But...you broke an important promise, didn't you...?\n\nMETAL EIKICHI: That's why...you're suffering, right...?\n\nTATSUYA: I'm sorry...\n\nMETAL JUN: Tatsuya...You can stop suffering...Let us ease you\nsuffering...?\n\n(Jun tries to stab Tatsuya, but Tatsuya stops it with his hand.)\n\nTATSUYA: Jun...I'll accept my punishment...But...not now...\n\n(Maya and co. jump in and the Boss Battle Theme from Persona 2: Innocent\nSin plays.)\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya!!\n\n(Katsuya fires shots but doesn't affect the kids.)\n\nBAOFU: Ch...Physical attacks don't even scratch 'em!\n\nTATSUYA: .........!?\n\n(Enter Battle)\n\nMETAL JUN: It's okay...You can stop suffering...\n\nTATSUYA: I'll accept my punishment...But...not now...!\n\n(After Battle)\n\n(The room is back to normal and Katsuya is tending to Tatsuya's wounds.)\n\nKATSUYA: I thought I taught you to hold a knife by its handle...\n\nTATSUYA: I'm sorry...\n\nKATSUYA: Don't say anything. My brother doesn't lower his head for\nlittle things like this...\n\nTATSUYA: No...The me of \"This Side\", also feels the same way...\n\nKATSUYA: I see...\n\nULALA: How can you two be brothers?\n\n(Talk to Members)\n\nTATSUYA: I'm sorry Maya...I troubled you...\n\n\nROOM OF TRANSPORT\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya...What is this?\n\nTATSUYA: I think it's some sort of teleportation device...it was another\nsymbol in the \"Other Side\"...\n\nULALA: It's called...\"Petite Deva\". It's written here.\n\nBAOFU: The symbol of Kandori...If we use this, we might be able to get\nback to the city.\n\n\nCONTROL ROOM\n\n(Maya and co. enter and there are dead soldiers all covered in blood,\nKatsuya checks one soldier's body.)\n\nKATSUYA: He has a pulse...!!!\n\nSOLDIER OF THE TENCHU ARMY: S...Save me...I don't...wanna die...\n\nKATSUYA: ...It's alright...You're not gonna die...What happened...?\n\nSOLDIER OF THE TENCHU ARMY:\nGeneral...became...monster......Everyone...killed...\nTell...daughter...grab...your dream...\n\nMAYA / KATSUYA : .........\n\nCREEPY VOICE: I......TAAAAIeeee...\n\nULALA: W, What...!?\n\nTATSUYA: .........!?\n\n(General Sugawara, who is now become a monster appears.)\n\nWAS SUGAWARA: Aaaarrrgh!!! It hurts!!!\n\n(A sound is heard and the party turns around to look at the screen.  An\nFMV is shown of Sumaru Castle rising out near Seven Sisters High School.\nThe walls of the Torifune surround Sumaru City and it rises up\ninto the air.)\n\nMAYA: .........!!!\n\nULALA: You're kidding me...?\n\nKATSUIYA: What, have they done!?\n\nBAOFU: Ch...!!!\n\n(enter battle)\n\nTATSUYA: Ugh...But, it's not too late...!!\n\nTATSUYA: Sudou is probaly in that castle...! He still has to do the\nDragon Ritual...!!! We haven't lost yet...!!!\n\n(after battle)\n\n(Maya, Baofu, and Katsuya are firing shots at Sugawara and then Tatsuya\npushes him off the plattform using his sword.)\n\nWAS SUGAWARA: Aaaarrrgh!!\n\nKATSUYA: I don't care if you're immortal or not...You lose...\n\n(a moment later)\n\nBAOFU: It's no good, it's not budging an inch...We couldn't land this\nship even if we wanted to...\n\nULALA: What are we gonna do!?...The city's flying...At this rate, the\ndragons will appear, and the earth's axis will rotate!\n\nKATSUYA: As long as we're alive, we can stop him...Tatsuya is right. We\nhaven't lost yet...We're gonna bring this ship down the way we're gonna\nbring down Sudou! Even if he has backup!\n\nBAOFU: That's fine, but looking at the teleport device he used, we can't\nstand around...A bit late, but we're going back up!!\n\n\nARAYA SHRINE\n\nBAOFU: Hmmm...It looks like we caught the last ride out of there...\n\n(Sumaru City is now in the air.  The City Map music is different (it's a\nremix of the previous City Map Music.) and Sumaru Castle is now located\nwhere Honmaru Park used to be. You can also get rumors from\n2X Slash and Johnny Rogers and bring Clair de Lune to Aoba and Padparcha\nin Konan.)\n\nRENGEDAI SATOMI TADASHI:\n\nTATSUYA: Ch...The Ameno Torifune...Even the shape is the same as the\nXibalba...\n\nHIRASAKA SATOMI TADASHI:\n\nSALAM LADEEN: Is it okay for a city to fly? Did the Lord allow it?\nNo...I must go. But the land is more\ndangerous...\n\n\nTOMI CHIROPRACTOR:\n\nTATSUYA: Sumaru Castle....it was just a park on the Other Side...As I\nfigured, it's different from before.\n\n\nIZAKAYA SHIRASHI:\n\nSHIRASHI LADY: Something like this happened before. Xibalba...?Ohh...I'm\ngetting a funny feeling.\nSUMARU PRISON:\n\nKEN: Wonder what happened to Michel!? When it is like this, we got to be\nworried! But I bet Ms. Miyabi is even more worried.\n\nMIYABI: Eikichi is very lucky, isn't he? He has so many great\ncompanions. I will believe in Eikichi's return and wait here.\nKASU HIGH ROOFTOP:\n\nMALE STUDENT: Yasuo!!!...Look at Narumi! It's all messed up!?\n\nYASUO: Looking from up here, everything looks so small...(sigh)...If I\njust realized sooner, my life might've been different....What...do I\nwant to do?\n\nBIKINI LINE:\n\nTATSUYA: It is lucky that at least the temple didn't come out. Even the\nslightest difference from the Other Side is good.\n\nAKI DUDE: What happened to me?...A while ago, I had a dream this city\nwas flying in the air...Could it have been a prophecy?\n\nSEEDY CD:\n\nSTORE OWNER: It's funny, but I'm not surprised that this city's flying.\nWas there something like this before? There wasn't, right?\n\nIXQUIC: Oh, misses! Big problem, big problem!!! There's a faster demon\nnow! Now it's 200 km/h Fogey!! The kids in the neighborhood said they\nsaw it at The Seedy CD!!! I must fulfill my duty as the transmigrated\nwarrior maiden! Demons that threaten human's lives, I shall whoop your\nasses!\n\n(Spread the rumor, fight the 200 km/h Fogey and recieve the Top Speed\nTitle. Show it to Ixquic.)\n\nIXQUIC: What the...!? The thing that you have...Isn't it Top Speed\nTitle!? Wow...Misses, you already beat up the 200 km/h Fogey? Are you a\ntransmigrated warrior, too? Please! Can you trade that Top-Speed Title\nwith my treasure? I REALLY need that! PLEASE!!!\n\n*MAYA: (Trade)*\n\nIXQUIC: Really!? Yaaaaaaaay!!! Okay then, here's your Legenbright.\nThanks, Misses!!!\n\nIXQUIC: Now that I think about it, I feel I've met you before. I wonder\nif this is also memories from my previous life...\n\nJOHNNY ROGERS\n\nULALA: I see...Everyone thinks the events that happened on the \"Other\nSide\" are dreams or something.\n\nTATSUYA: There are more people who saw the same spectacle. It's proof\nthat the world is starting to\ndisappear...At this rate...\n\nRUMORMONGER BARKKEPER: So this a prophetic dream...I dreamt awhile back\nthat the city was floating. The ship below was called the \"Xibalba\"...\n\nSUMARU GENIE\n\nTATSUYA: Ulala asked me what I was called on the \"Other Side\"...All I\ndid was answer...\n\nULALA:Awwwwwwwwwe...Tatsuya was called \"Tatsu\" over on the \"Other Side\".\n\nKATSUYA: \"Tatsu\", huh...It's not a bad nicknam. Hmm? Then what about me?\n\n\nHIIRAGI THERAPY:\n\nULALA: Ma-ya! Mary went out on her own! Is she okay?\n\nREIKO: Mary went outside. She said she couldn't leave the city as it\nis...I hope she's alright...\n\nPADPARCHA:\n\nTATSUYA:\"Everyone has the right to grasp a dream\". That is what you said\non the Other Side, but do I really have the right to grasp one?...\n\n\nSUMARU TV:\n\nCORPSE OF A TENCHU SOLDIER: (Looks like he was a member of the Civil\nDefense Force. He's already stopped breathing.)\n\nBRAD: Da ha ha ha...What happened? You look so surprised. Are you\nsurprised by my activity? Da ha ha ha! ...Well, that's the deal, so you\nguys go on to the Sumaru Castle without any worry. I'll show the people\nof the city just how way cool I am.\n\nMAMI: It seems Lisa hasn't come home yet either. Where could she have\ngone at a time like this...? Even this place would have been in danger\nif it weren't for Mr. Brad Uesugi...Her father must be worried as well.\n\nMIHO: Did you know? Brad Uesugi is very powerful! He may be a good match\nfor Lisa's father. But based on impact, Lisa's dad wins! He's REALLY\nscary when he's mad. He does not say a word! He's like a\n\"silent\" dad.\n\n\nKISMET: LOBBY\n\nBAOFU: I understand Suou's apprehension...But just worrying about it\ndoesn't do us any good. There was once a Sumaru Castle, and now there is\na Sumaru Castle at the same location...That's all.\n\nTATSUYA: It's just like Baofu said...The Sumaru Castle wasn't on the\n\"Other Side\"...But it is on \"This Side\"...That's all.\n\n\nKISMET EDITORIAL ROOM:\n\nFUJII: Eh, Yukki? Yukki went out to protect everybody...To stop the\nTenchu Army. I'm going to record\nthis real event in its entirety on film. That's the onlt thing I can\ndo....That is my cuase.\n\n\nMIZUNO'S OFFICE:\n\nEDITOR-IN-CHIEF MIZUNO: Amano!...Get that man out of here! I let him in\nbecuase the Editor-in-Chief of Moo magazine insisted. I found out it was\nto get rid of him! There's no time for that!!\n\nMR. KASHIHARA: Hello there...I checked the legend about this incident,\nand I found out something incredible! I thought I thought I had to let\nthe Editor-in-Chief of Moo magazine know about this...It's a little\nlong, but would you listen?\n\n*MAYA: This isn't Moo.*\n\nMR. KASHIHARA: Oh really?...I'm terribly sorry.\n\n(A moment later)\n\nEDITOR-IN-CHIEF MIZUNO: Who was that man...?\n\n\nPARABELLUM:\n\nMATSUOKA: With the surfacing of Ameno Torifune, and the show of the\nTenchu Army, this city's in more chaos than ever...But, don't\nworry...Leave the safety of the people to us.  Master Nate is battling\nthe Tenchu Army with his comrades. Master Amano, you have a mission to\naccomplish...Please hurry to Sumaru Castle.\n\nRUMOR-LOVIN' BARTENDER: Oh welcome! I'm so glad, you are unharmed...Huh,\nme? There was a rumor amongour regulars that Narumi was in danger. You\nwouldn't want anything to happen for real, right?\nThen right when I moved just to be safe....Now this world is really\ngoing to end? Ah, but at least we're still safe.\n\nRUMOR-LOVIN' BARTENDER: Do you know the purging of the Tenchu Army? They\nkill those who have Kegare in them...Please watch out!\n\nSUMARU CASTLE\n\nSTATUE OF JOKA: I am Joka...The one who opens the door to Utena...it is\nsuggested to solemly offer\nancient prayers...\n\nSTATUE OF FUKUGI: I am Fukugi...Prayers of Kotodama, the spirited\nwords...You should gather the 7\nKotodama and offer ancient prayers....\n\n(talk to party members)\n\nULALA: This is the \"Big Dipper\", right? There's one more in between the\nstatues..What's that one?\n\nBAOFU: There's no door connecting to the back...So those lights lead to\nsomewhere....\n\nKATSUYA: Prayers? Seven Kotodama...? Are they saying if we don't figure\nthis out, we won't be able to open Utena's door?\n\nTATSUYA: A black hole...That means trouble...\n\n\nKEGARE CHAMBER\n\n(Talk to party members)\n\nBAOFU: We can't just destroy that thing without giving it some thought\nfirst...They saved up some pretty nasty things.\n\nULALA: How much is in there...? The back is all hazy, so I can't see...\n\nKATSUYA: The Kegare they got from the people...They're transporting\nit...somewhere...\n\nTATSUYA: I cannot run away from my sin....so easily...I have to atone\nfor my sin by myself...\n\nCHAMBER OF HENBAI\n\nPLAINSPHERE LITHOGRAPH: One who knoweth the intention of the 7 Kotodama.\nThou shalt offer the great paryer.\n\n(PASSWORD IS PERSEUS)\n\nPLAINSPHERE LITHOGRAPH: One who realizes the intention of the Seven\nSpirits offer the Henbai of Perseus, and walk the path to the stage. If\nthou completest this, the Hokutoku Gohou shall be unbound, and\nthe path to the Stage shall open.\n\nKATSUYA: I did some research prior to coming here. Perseus is a\nconstellation named after the man who slew Medusa in Greek mythology.\nMany people of ancient times believed in the stars, and it's no surprise\nthat Perseus was picked. He was a heroic figure. It IS a bit odd for\nthem to use a Western name, but people today have strange ideas of\nmagic. Another effect of rumors, I guess.\n\nULALA: Wow, you're such a hardworking guy. So what's a \"henbai\"?\n\nKATSUYA: Henbai is a type of \"magical stepping\" that originated in\nChina. With this, you crush evil stars and invite good luck. Hokutoku is\na magic where  you draw Ursa Major on the earth to sanctify and protect\nthat area...Most likely, it means to walk in a certain pattern, or\nsomething like that...\n\n\nCHAMBER OF UTENA\n\n(The Four NWO executives are lying dead becuase Tatsuzou Sudou killed\nthem with a sword, the party comes inside and confronts him.)\n\nKATSUYA: Sudou...!? You bastard...!!!\n\nBAOFU: You've finally gone mad...Tatsuzou!!!\n\nTATSUZOU: Mad you say...? This world is what's gone mad!  Tell me what\nis stirring this country!!\n\nTATSUZOU: Fronts, fatigue, and contradictions...People think only of\nthemselves!! And so, punishment will be yours again!! This world is\ndecayed..The law, the system, and all humans who live off of it!!!\n\nKATSUYA: Damn you, Tatsuzou! What right do you have to judge us!?\n\nBAOFU: That's bullshit...Deceiving people with stupid curses...Your\ndeception ends here, old man!\n\nTATSUZOU: Fools...You don't understand human nature.  Curses and\nfortunes were things you wanted! Look down there! People are still\ncurious about fortunes, jinxes, and wish for good luck...You cannot stop\na heart that involunterily pumps its blood for curses!... Or the pulsing\npower of life it brings!\n\nTATSUZOU: Arise, Gozen! I have delivered you the Kegare of my sinful\ncompratriots! Let people's words become a reality!!!\n\n(An FMV plays of the dragons being summoned from around the world, and\nthey all gather at Sumaru Castle.)\n\nULALA / MAYA: Oh my God!\n\nTATSUZOU: Hahaha!! Hya--hahaha!! Behold!! The Earth Dragon will destroy\nEarth along with Joka!! The axis will shift and people shall die!! I\nhave transformed history!! What is life if you can't even bear this!?\n\n(Tatsuzou starts to shake.)\n\nTATSUZOU: Gwo..!? GGGGGGG..G, Gozen..Why me too......!?\n\n(Ttasuzou is transformed into a beast called  the Detested Hunter.)\n\nDETESTED HUNTER: SHAGYAAAAAAA!!\n\n(enter battle)\n\nTATSUYA: Another one...has fallen...\n\nBAOFU: What a pathetic sight..Tatsuzou...THIS is the result of deceiving\npeople!?\n\nKATSUYA: Your dirty sins..We shall cleanse them!\n\n(after battle)\n\nULALA: It's no use...The Earth Dragon and Joka aren't disappearing! At\nthis rate...\n\nBAOFU: The source of evil still remains...Tatsuya!

A.K.A Kiyotada Sumaru.)\n\n(enter battle)\n\nTATSUYA: I see...You won't come out until I defeat this guy...\n\nGOZEN: Who are you, to awaken me from my slumber!?\n\n(After Battle)\n\n(Gozen lies on the floor.)\n\nBAOFU: Did we do it...!?\n\n(Gozen explodes into pink energy.)\n\nKATSUYA: That can't be...What the hell is that...!?\n\n(An FMV plays of Sumaru City in chaos. The dragons disappear, the\nTorifune walls twist and crumble, and Sumaru City is being sucked into\nan unknown dimension. A small version of Nyarlathotep's lair is seen.)\n\n\nMONADO MANDALA\n\nULALA: Where the hell are we!?\n\n(Nyarlathotep, who is disguising himself as Tatsuya in his Seventh\nuniforn appears.)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: My domain, the Collective Unconsciousness...Welcome.\n\nKATSUYA / MAYA / BAOFU: Tatsuya...!?\n\n(Tatsuya strikes Nyarlathotep, but Nyarlathotep grabs the edge of\nTatsuya's sword.)\n\nTATSUYA: Oooooooo-----!!!\n\n(Maya and co. draw thier weapons.)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: (snicker)...Easy now...You wouldn't want to hurt this\npretty face of yours? It suits me, don't you agree?\n\nTATSUYA: Shut up...!!!\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Humans are strange...I came here because you wanted to\nmeet me...Now you want me to go? You're contradicting yourself...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP (as Ulala): By the way...do you know the \"three poisons of\nlife\"?...What I'm referring to is \"Anger\", \"Ignorance\", and \"Vengeance\".\n\nNYARLATHOTEP (as Baofu): There are countless others, but these are my\nprimary sources of power.\n\nNYARLATHOTEP (as Katsuya): Oh, come now...You disappoint me...It's\nreally simple...Even your pathetic brain can comprehend that...\n\nKATSUYA: Are you trying to say...that you are the \"shadow\" of us\nhumans!?\n\nNYARLATHOTEP (as Maya): So, you do understand...I am a reflection of\nyour true selves...Let's play one last game...\n\n(Eikichi, Jun, and Lisa appear, but they are chained up in the air and\nNyarlathotep reverts back to his Tatsuya form.)\n\nTATSUYA: Jun...Eikichi...Lisa!!!\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: You remember what I told you, right? If they remember the\nOther Side, then this world will cease to exist.  You of all people\nshould understand...Right, Tatsuya? The Paradox?\n\nTATSUYA: Ch...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: If you can show me your powers to suppress shadows in this\nworld, I will give back the toys one at a time.

It's just too brutal...\n\nTATSUYA: .........Let's move on. I'm...ready.\n\n\nNYARLATHOTEP'S LAIR\n\n(Nyarlathotep is standing in the middle and the party appears. They draw\nout their weapons.)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Congratulations...You finally made it...The last toy is\nright here...\n\n(Jun is shown chained in the air.)\n\nMAYA: .........\n\nTATSUYA: Give...Jun back...!!!\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: You're wondering why nothing has happened to you. Well, I\nsaved the best for last...We must show your secret to your freinds.\nRight, \"Paradox Boy\"?...\n\n\nFLASHBACK: NYARLATHOTEP'S LAIR\n\n(This shows the continuing scene from the final flashback at Mt. Iwato\nafter Maya dies.)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Huhahahahaha!!! You have learned something. The reality of\nthe world..There are things that you have no control over! I am the\nshadow of all humans. As long as humans have dark hearts, I will live.\nFace the last trial of the Crawling Chaos!!!\n\n(Nyarlathotep changes into a monster-like creature and disappears along\nwith Maya Okamura.)\n\nPHILEMON: There is a way to change this reality. You must forget about\nthat one summer day...Nyarlathotep began weaving the threads of fate\nthat day...If we erase that instance, this tragedy would never have\noccured. A new time woven and a world reborn...\n\nEIKICHI: You can...do that...?\n\nPHILEMON: Realize this...A human's heart possess the power to change the\nflow of reality. Even without the Xilbalba or the Crystal Skull, your\nstrong will and action have the energy to change reality. Even the\npower that created the cosmos you live in is the same as yours..In this\ncollective unconsciousness, it is\npossible.\n\nJUN: Do you mean start over from the beginning?  In return for\nour...memories...?\n\nGINKO: You mean...forget everyone...!? I...I don't want to!!  Isn't\nthere another way!?\n\nPHILEMON: Not in this world, where he has power. The dark hearts of\npeople unconsciously doing world destruction is his source of power...In\norder to suppress him, people must change...You will create the new\nworld...\n\nJUN: I...won't forget...How can I forget...\n\nEIKICHI: Hell yeah...I ain't gonna forget...!! If everything was set up\nby him, then let's do it...Let's teach him that things won't go his way\nanymore...\n\nGINKO: We...WILL...meet again, right...?\n\nPHILEMON: Then see yourself as who you should be. Your powers should\nmold a new reality.\n\n(Jun disappears, then Eikichi, and then the dead Maya. Lisa walks up to\nTatsuya to give him a kiss.)\n\nGINKO: A kiss...So that I won't forget about my Tatsuya...\n\n(Lisa disappears.)\n\nPHILEMON: Well then...We will part for a short time. Are there any final\nwords you want to say?\n\n*TATSUYA: (Hit Him)*\n\n(Tatsuya punches Philemon and Philemon's mask comes off.  His face is\nthe same as Tatsuya's.)\n\nPHILEMON: I am the one who exists in the boundary between the\nconsciousness and the unconsciousness...I am you and you are I...I will\nalways be watching from within you...Farewell...\n\n(Tatsuya disappears.)\n\n(An FMV plays of the kids saying goodbye to each other)\n\nEIKICHI: We went through a lot, but I'm glad we met again. Don't forget\nwhat you promised dude.\n\nLISA: Tatsuya...Don't forget me...I do love you.\n\nJUN: You won't forget, or say goodbye. Just thank you.\n\nTATSUYA: I don't want to forget what happened! How can I forget?   Guys,\ndon't go...Don't leave me alone...Please no, please no.  No!....(echoes)\n\n(Tatsuya disappears. FMV ends there.)\n\n\nREALITY\n\nKATSUYA / MAYA / BAOFU / ULALA: .........!!!\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: (chuckles) How's that, Tatsuya Suou!? Do you like your\npunishment?  You couldn't ask them to fight with you. That's because the\nsole reason the world is at the brink of destruction\nis...YOU!!!\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: You broke your promise with your freinds. The condition to\nstay in this world was to give up your memories from the old world!!!\nBut you rejected it, ...At that moment, the boundary\nseperating the 2 worlds vacillated...That was you!!! That's why you\nfailed to synchronize with the you of this world...\n\nMAYA: .........\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Push all the pain upon your freinds, and still retain your\nmemory...That's an unforgivable sin...A sin must have punishment.\nThat's why I gave you the chance to meet her again. I coaxed fate for\nyou all to meet again.\n\nTATSUYA: Ch...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: What's wrong?...Are you going to hide in your shell again?\nThat face of yours when you met that woman and regained your\nmemories...You should have seen it...\n\nMAYA: .........\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Am I detestable? But that is what you humans desired...You\ncraved destruction from the depths of your hearts...That is me! The\nshadow does not forgive anyone who goes against fate.\n\nBAOFU: Ahhh, shut up...You can take this fate of yours and stick it up\nyour ass!  Listen up, Tatsuya...Fate is...\n\nKATSUYA: No different than a prediction too late. If something happens,\nall you have to say is this...\n\nULALA: \"It was all fate!\"\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Muhahahaha...!!! Pathetic humans! I'll show you what\nhappened to those who said the same thing to me in the past!!!\n\n(Nyarlathotep transforms into his Moon Howler form.)\n\n(Enter Battle)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Understand that there is no point in living! Cry, that\nthere is no answer! Where there is darkness, there are shadows! I,\nmyself, am all of you humans!!\n\nTATSUYA: I won't turn my back again...On the sin I committed..Nor on\nmyself!!\n\nTATSUYA / NYARLATHOTEP: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\n\n(After you beat his Moon Howler form, he'll change into his true form,\nwhich is a \"mass of gods with 1000 names and faces at the center of\nspace\" as his description says.)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Fuhahahahaha! This is! Splendid! You are the first to see\nthis form! Die with my highest praise!\n\n(After Battle)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: It...can't be...!? It's not possible...!!! This\ncontradiction...I won't accept i--t!!!\n\n(Philemon appears in the air carrying Jun in his arms.)\n\nPHILEMON: Crawling Chaos, accept your defeat...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Philemon!!!\n\nPHILEMON: They represent the potential of mankind. You, the dark side of\nthe collective unconsciousness, are linked to all humans. THAT is\nwhy...They...moved the hearts of the people...\n\nKATSUYA: All potential is born from chaos...I see...That's right...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Hmph...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Muhahaha...!!! What irony!!! THIS is my FATE...!?\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: But...remember this...! The masses of idiocy that squim in\nthe center of the cosmos are yourselves...!!! As long as I you\nexist...so too shall I...!!!\n\nBAOFU: You're too damn stubborn...There's no such thing as a human\nwithout shadows...We'll make you remember that your place is here...Just\ngo to Hell and be done with it...\n\n(Maya shoots at Nyarlathotep and Tatsuya strikes Nyarlathotep.\nNyarlathotep screams and disappears.)\n\nULALA: It's over...\n\nTATSUYA: No...There's still...one more thing...\n\nTATSUYA: The fact remains that I'm the Paradox...If I stay here...Then\n\"This Side\" will be engulfed by the \"Other Side\"...\n\nBAOFU / KATSUYA: .........\n\nULALA / MAYA: Tatsuya...You're not...\n\nTATSUYA: I'm going home...\n\n*MAYA: Tatsuya...Thank you for everything...*\n\nTATSUYA: I made a promise to Jun...He kept his word...Now it's my\nturn...The only thing left on the Other Side is our city.  We'll rebuild\na great world...\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya...You...\n\n(Energy surrounds Tatsuya.)\n\nBAOFU: Tatsuya...There's one thing I forgot to tell you...There are good\nthings even when you become an adult...Just a few...\n\nTATSUYA: Yeah...I know...\n\n(Tatsuya splits into two.)\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya...!\n\nULALA: Tatsuya...!\n\nMAYA: .........\n\nTATSUYA FROM THE OTHER SIDE: We are connected by this ocean. We\ncan...meet again...\n\n(Tatsuya from the Other Side disappears and Tatsuya from This Side falls\non the floor.)\n\n\nThe spectre has returned to the deep corners of the subconscious, so too\nhas her love, retreated to a world beyond her reach. The city is showing\nsigns of recovery...but many will never know the truth of what happened.\nNonetheless, what Tatsuya left behind will live on in the hearts of the\npeople.  At least that's what I want to believe...I want to see his fire\nin their hearts...\n\n*ENDING*\n\nKISMET: EDITORIAL ROOM\n\n(Maya is sitting at her desk and the cub reporter walks up to her.)\n\nCUB REPORTER: Miss Amano, the chief is calling you.\n\n(Maya gets up.)\n\nCUB REPORTER: Miss Amano...\n\nCUB REPORTER: I'm gonna keep working here a bit longer...After looking\nat you, I thought I could work harder too...I don't know how to say it,\nbut I'll work hard!...This is my fate!\n\nMAYA: ........\n\n(Maya walks off.)\n\n\nMIKI'S GRAVE\n\n(Baofu is shown standing there.)\n\nKAORU: Sorry...Miki...Everyone's looking for someone these days...It's\ntime for me to move on...I took down the sign...I won't be chasing\nrumors anymore...I'm starting a search agency for missing people...Heh,\nafter what just took place, we're doing okay. Well, I'm starting all\nover again...So \"he\" won't laugh at me...\n\n(A car honk is heard.)\n\nKAORU: My partner beckons once again...\n\n(Ulala appears.)\n\nULALA: Kaoru, we should get going. Our client might start complaining...\n\nKAORU: Yeah, I got it.\n\n(Baofu/Kaoru walks away.)\n\nULALA: Miki...I'll take care of him...so don't worry...\n\n(A car honk is heard and Ulala walks off.)\n\n\nPARABELLUM\n\nNATE: Indeed..Do they know the meaning of being punctual?\n\nELLEN: (snicker)...Don't worry, they'll be here. By the way...I read\nyour dissertation on economics. It was brilliant.\n\nNATE: Hmph...Of course it was.\n\nNATE: But thanks to him, we can go on with our lives.\n\nELLEN: It's...ironic, isn't it...His appearence is the same...but I\ncan't believe he doesn't remember anything...\n\nNATE: The same...with Jun Kashihara and the rest...Imagine not\nremembering being the key to saving this world...\n\nELLEN: Hey...Nate...Do you think...he...they...don't actually\nremember...?\n\nNATE: I'm not sure...But I know that there are two things for\ncertain...Praying for the people's sake isn't wrong. And...we have an\nobligation to lead this world properly...This world which he saved.\n\nELLEN: You're right...\n\n(Mary, Brad, Yuki, and Chris come inside.)\n\nBRAD: Yo! I saw the cover, Ellen! That's great!\n\nYUKI: Shunsuke praised you about having a great smile. Now Ellen can\nstand on her own!\n\nMARY: I have an announcement!!! Chris is getting married!!! And she's\ncute, too!! Congratulations!!!\n\nCHRIS: W, Well, her house collasped, y'know...B, Besides...we already\ndecided the name...! If it's a boy, \"Takashi\"..Good name, huh!?\n\nNATE: Yeah...It's a good name...\n\n(The characters start talking until someone comes through the door. This\nperson however is not shown. Ellen and Mary go up to greet this person.)\n\nELLEN / MARY: Welcome back...\n\n\nARAYA SHRINE\n\n(Eikichi is standing alone and Jun comes up.)\n\nJUN: What is the leader doing here...?\n\nEIKICHI: I don't know...But...I felt that I left behind a very important\nmemory here...\n\nJUN: Me, too...\n\nLISA: You guys, too...\n\n(Lisa walks up.)\n\nLISA: Somehow...I'm very sad...\n\nEIKICHI: Yeah...\n\nJUN: I feel a great void in my heart...\n\n\nEBISU BEACH\n\n(Tatsuya is there alone and he flicks his lighter.

Maya is standing at a crosswalk and a\nfamilliar golden butterfly is watching her.  As Maya crosses the\nstreet, she stops when she sees Tatsuya in a helmet on his motorylce.\nThe golden butterfly flies away.

was fried movin at slow speed\nThis thick bitch chose me and was stickin like liquor\nShe look to tight that bodies right my heart and mind was like \"Dick her\"\nBut wit my body aching from hurl sensation that's got me shaken\nI swiftly took the number and passed on ass that was for the taken\nI remember wakin' up at the flat fucked up in the back\nCheckin on my weed and scratch I damn near fell out the lat\nI hit the sack to sleep it off woke up woozy and still smoking\nTwistin' swishers thinking about last night and the bitch that was scopin\nFuck it lets get 'em on I grabbed the phone \"Girl call your friends\"\nThen I hit Twista and Maze and them bout the bitch in the Benz\nNigga push only cause I see I'm already bendin the block\nYou know the lit niggas you'll find us in my

to talk up on the shoppin spree\nOr a B of that stinky green free\nStraight getting, to puff puff pass\nAnd drive up my gas hittin all the hot blocks\nBumpin \"Legit Ballers\" to \"Rock Y'all Spot\"\nEverybody know the shit 'bout to drop\nSee from Northbound to Ten Row in it go tryin to get they props\nPollutin the air wit squares, blunts, and tops\nSettin up shops for lots comin back nots\nEach and everyday of the week\nThe Mobsta Elites be on somebody porch dumpin heat\nBustin flows in the cipher getting deep\nWhile we cheat something sweet to Legendary beats\n'Till we reached our peak\nScummy aloud attractin crowds to the street\nThen it's time to retreat grab something to eat\nAnd head to the late front to get up wit some freaks\nWit a treat under the seat\nFor the cats who get the sudden urge and wanna try to jack\nCause when your pockets is fat\nIt seems like all the haters and hood-rats want to attack\nAnd when the park close we hit the liquor store\nFor a box of Sitches and a fifth of Yak\nSouth on the corner and get a few sacks\nOr betta yet the whole pack so we can get back\nOn the\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Twista]\nOne morning I\nWoke up next to a

gonna be hot outside gotta get up and lay my clothes out\nIt's gonna be too many hoes out\nBefore my ladies rolled out I got 'em to clean up the whole house\nThen I threw my fit on look in the mirror get on gone\n\"Nigga you looking Dougie plus you got a knot\"\nAin't no cruising up out the hop\nI'm hangin by the spot cause I had to put the Lexus off up in the shop\nBut it's all to good it's a

Remember this is my opinion and preference.\n\n50- Kano- Made In ManorGrime, weather to categorize it as a genre on its own, or a sub genre in hip hop, has become a scene that is constantly growing, and 2016 once again was a massive year for the UK acts.\n\nKano, hailed as one of the finding fathers of grime exerted his influence once again by delivering a strong release in March of 2016. Kano has proved to be consistent through his many years in the grime scene and this album does not disappoint. This album carries you on a journey through every corner of England, with the energy on tracks such as \u2018Flow Of The Year & \u2018\u2019New Banger\u2019\u2019 but Kano also varies his style with more introspective records such as \u2018Deep Blues\u2019\u2019.  One of three grime albums to make this list, it deserves its place with great validity.\n\nFavorite track: Flow of the Year featuring JME.\n49: Abz- Kosher AbzIn the era of the turn up, it is much harder to find an artist that a regular adolescent can relate to. It\u2019s even harder to find an artist that appreciates the older generation in terms of sonically implementing them into their own sound.\nAlthough this release has a consistent laid-back style nearly all the way through, it seems to get better track-by-track.  Abz is able to flow over jazzy and soulful instrumentals in a way that sounds almost effortless. Lyrically this project requires your full attention to fully appreciate Abz rapping through chapters in his story.\n\nFavorite track: 86\n\nFind the tape here: https://kosherabz.bandcamp.com/album/kshr\n\n\n48- Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein-Stranger Things Official Soundtrack (Vol 1)If you were a fan of this phenomenal Netflix TV show, listening to this soundtrack will increase your love for the show in another variable, not that you needed any more. It\u2019s special how music, through the ears, can make you relive those moments you observe, through the eyes, when binge watching the mystery of Will Byers.\n\nThe scorers Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein rightly ensure that the soundtrack is heavily 80s influenced in terms of production, just like the TV show itself.  A year that was not exactly blessed with plenty of quality soundtrack material, gladly, this helped shed a better light in that department.\n\nFavorite track: Kids\n47- PNL \u2013Dans le legendeNot much is known of this French duo, but their popularity is growing smoothly like a healthy child. Their mysterious nature is captivating audiences to get to know more about them, but their music is doing a lot of speaking currently.\n\nTheir melodies are something that will catch your attention as soon as you press play, combined with their melancholic song writing, PNL are making a exceptional track record for themselves in the French and international scene. Their first album set them up nicely as it made them breakthrough to the French audience, with radio hits such as \u2018DA\u2019 on this album, they have now made the top of charts theirs in France.\n\nFavorite track: Tu Sais Pas.\n46-Norah Jones- Day breaksIn times filled with technology taking over originality, Norah Jones is blessed with a wonderful natural voice that no technology could enhance any better. She has afforded herself the luxury to to dib and dab across genres in her career and she never allows herself to be boxed in or stagnant to one sound.\n\nThis freedom mentality carries on to her wonderful latest release. Day Breaks may not be an album filled with loud instrumentations or obnoxious production but the jazzy feel all over is strong enough to give this album so much life. Norah Jones as she almost always seems to do, does justice to the classical songs she covers and at the same time bring her own style in perfectly.  Topic wise, this album is not all about the romance life and one of the standout tracks \u2018\u2019Flipside\u2019\u2019 actually offers great commentary on social issues\n\nFavorite track: Don\u2019t Be Denied\n\n45-Noname- TelefoneIt may be quite surprising that the only new Chiraq rapper that has made this list isn\u2019t a rapper that totes the glock on the daily, well at least, not that we know off.  Slowly chopping away with quality features after features on other Chicago rappers such as Chance The Rapper and Vic Mensa, it was time Noname attempted to make a name for herself on the main stage.\n\nHer awkward, soft and intimate mixtape that is spread with jazz influence has definitely position Noname in a positive light as she progresses as an artist.\n\n\nFavorite track: Diddy Bop featuring Raury & Cam O\u2019bi\n44- Kery James- Mouhammed AlixIn case you didn\u2019t know, French rap is winning currently and with Kery James, we have the people\u2019s leader. The name of this album should be self-explanatory as to an indication of what\u2019s to come. Hard-hitting, rebellious and relentless are just a few words that you can use to summarize Kery James\u2019s seventh studio album, just like the late great boxer himself. For those unfamiliar with this name Kery James has stayed true to his powerful, politically & socially charged views from the start of his career. A man never afraid to speak his mind of every social issue he has encountered or he is witnessing (Check out Kery James x Bene- L\u2019Impasse) is a trait that continuous on this album. The major themes of this album are smartly balanced as Kery James opens up about his split personality, one that is the peaceful one, the other being the aggressive violent one.\n\n\u2018\u2019FDT\u2019\u2019 by YG 4hunnid may be the hottest politically charged record this year, but Kery James\u2019s sturdy \u2018\u2019Musique Negre\u2019\u2019 cannot go unmentioned in that conversation. This record is aimed at to a French politician who vowed to not allow Hip Hop music or black music to be played in the country if he gained the power, seeming to be not far from the seeds of Donald Trump. What makes this album even better is that Kery James just does not believe that rebelling and violence is the answer but on \u2018\u2019 Vivre ou Mourir Ensemble\u2019\u2019 over a calming beautifully laid production, he urges people to unite and work together to improve the way society and the higher powers treat certain races. Powerful album.\n\nFavorite track: Mohammed Alix\n43- Maren Morris- HeroThis record is deemed as a country record, but once you listen to it, you will be telling yourself its much more than just another country record.\n\nAs a fan of both Hip Hop & R&B, the influences and references appealed to my ears and this is groundbreaking for a country artist, let alone a female one. The production on records like \u2018\u2019Rich\u2019\u2019 which got a lot of radio play, may indicate that Maren Morris can be the pole stabbed into the country scene to direct everyone to the path country music is going to take from here on.  Morris already seems to have the audience on her side; the success of her singles proves that more people are accepting of this change as country music evolves.\n\nFavorite track: 80\u2019s Mercedes\n42- Aesop Rock- The Impossible KidNo not A$AP Rocky, Aesop Rock is a Caucasian rapper. One for the acquired taste, Aesop Rock is never going to be the majority\u2019s favorite rapper. No one would know this more than the man himself who is arguably the most abstract rapper around. The Impossible Kid is an album that makes my list for the same reason I rate Aesop Rock so high.\nFirstly, Rock\u2019s ability to play on words is constantly fascinating and listening to him can be compared to putting together a very challenging puzzle. By having so many projects out with this same tone, it was refreshing to see Aesop Rock tone it down   bit more on this release and instead he decides to open up personally more than ever. Once you get all the pieces of the puzzle together for the Impossible Kid, you will find Aesop telling you stories from his brother to his brand new cat \u2018\u2019Kirby\u2019\u2019.  His never-ending vocabulary enables him to draw you fictional pictures as you listen through and this is one of my favorite assets than an artist can posses, Aesop Rock has this in abundance.  It\u2019s easy to forget with what seems like so much hard work with words that Aesop Rock produces most of his tracks and those carry similar complexity to his world play.\n\nFavorite track: Lotta Years.\n\n41-$uicideBoys \u2013Radical Suicide (EP)Grimey, tough and eerie production is a full whenever this New Orleans act gets on the microphone, or jungle. This particular style and sound of music seems to be growing and gaining a pocket of hardcore fan base, along with Bones, these two acts give you a dark, drug filled feel but its very unlikely that there is anything more to them than that. The breath control and flow technics of this duo certainly is something to be applauded and get hyped about and this is an well put together exhibition EP of their skill set that I really found a liking towards this year.\n\nFavorite track: Goosebumps\n40: Weezer- Weezer (The White Album)One of the older alternative rock bands still active in 2016 definitely produced one of my favorite alternative rock albums of the year. Having previously left me underwhelmed in recent years with the quality of their albums, The White Album stands tall and proud above their previous efforts in the at least the last 6 years.\n\nThis album impressed me in many different aspects, notably, it seemed that the band have found the blessings in disguise of no longer having to compete with a larger pool of relevant alternative rock bands that aims to please a certain demographic and the mainstream radio ears. This has allowed the band to come out with a more likeable and intimate album for every true Weezer fan. Although a track like \u2018\u2019California Kids\u2019\u2019 displays sunny vibes like the California sun, most of the album features more heart felt revealing songs about the lead singer\u2019s personal life that is not usually associated with Weezer\u2019s catalogue.\n\nFavorite track: L.A. Girlz\n39-Vince Staples- Prima Donna EPFollowing Summer Time 06, NORF SIDE LONG BEACH rapper Vince Staples has risen a lot on everyone\u2019s radar.\n\nWith this EP, Vince Staples doesn\u2019t shy away from his creative beat selection and production. This very energetic project may get rather exhausting or hard to take everything in at first, but this is perhaps what Vince Staples was aiming for as he stretches his sound and experimentation. As soon as you hear the Andre 3000 sample in the early days of this record it\u2019s hard to stop head bopping throughout as \u2018War Ready\u2019 sets you up perfectly for that mood.\n\nFavorite track: Pimp Hand\n38- Mitski \u2013 Puberty 2Emotions are galore as Mitski takes us for a fascinating walk in her shoes.  The maturity and different dimensions in the voice of this 26-year-old indie rock singer is so phenomenal that you\u2019re left with little or no option but to gravitate to her.\n\nOnce you watch the music video to her award worthy track \u2018\u2019Your Best American Girl\u2019\u2019 you can see that Mitski has a very conceptual mind that reflects in the deepness of this album. One for the deeper meaning, this track is heavily influenced by her personal view that makes her even more endearing. If you\u2019re an individual that is suffering or has suffered from racial identity, this should be your go to album.\n\nFavorite track \u2018\u2019 Your Best American Girl\u2019\u2019\n37- Lil Yachty \u2013Lil BoatOn the subject of story telling, short story, Early this past summer, my guy Nnamdi got into my car and played a bunch of cartoon noises that I questioned if this was some sort of troll. A few weeks go by and there I was singing along to this bunch of noise that is titled \u2018\u2019Minnesota\u2019\u2019\n\nLil Yachty\u2019s whole make up is asking for you to hate on him, from his attention grabbing red hair to his mumbling auto tuned lullaby voice. This polarizing view puts Lil Boat in a unique stance, as there was nothing quite like this project in 2016.  We all enjoy turning up to Chief Keef and his off springs boasting about catching bodies and carrying glocks over trap and drill beats, but this year, we were introduced to the opposite. Yachty is unashamedly appearing rather innocent and softer as he mourns over his broken heart over more sophisticated trap beats. This project came at the perfect came as hip hop is slowly moving towards a more accepting nature when it comes to a way an artist chooses to express themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, a project like this will fall well short technically compared to the other projects on this list (E.g. Lil Boat reveled it took him less than ten minutes to finish the loving ballad \u2018\u2019One night\u2019\u2019) and this may work against him in the future. For now, its unpredictable how far Lil Yachty and his sound will stay around for but with features such as Broccoli, there are glimmers he could be the birth of the new sound, or he could just be another Fetty Wap and this time next year Lil Boat won\u2019t be on the sailing team.\nFavorite track: Good day featuring Skippa Da Flippa.\n36- Kevin Gates \u2013 IslahWhen Kevin Gates\u2019s Islah debut album went platinum, (barely any features by the way), many eyebrows were raised. Numbers don\u2019t lie though. Helped by the success of  \u2018\u2019Really Really\u2019\u2019 & \u2018\u2019 2 Phones\u2019\u2019 it seemed like Kevin Gates had finally found the recipe for radio and cross over success. Certainly took him long enough because Gates has been around for some time now without releasing a studio album.\n\nIslah, named after his daughter, makes for a very entertaining listen weather you were a Kevin Gates listener prior or a new listener.  You will enjoy the thuggish & savage rhyming along with the catchy melodic hooks that Kevin Gates has a skill for. He will never fail to make you laugh on social media or in interviews hence him being one of my favorite characters in the rap scene, but it was pleasing to see him back his talking with music that ended up being very successful. Free Kevin Gates!\nFavorite track: Pride\n35- 2 Chainz- ColleGrove.It\u2019s credit to 2 Chainz that he may have been well worthy of having at least two projects that he released in 2016 in this list. As ColleGrove was the only project officially released as an album, it\u2019s the more suitable pick.\n\nThe always-working TittyBoy with the help of a hungry Lil Wayne, were able to come up with viral tunes such as \u2018\u2019Watch Out\u2019\u2019 but with variety, as songs like \u2018\u2019Dedication\u2019\u2019 was more revealing than anything. This duo seems to have a very good chemistry between them as they trade witty, savage & hype bars over bumping trap beats. With production from the likes of Metro Booming, Zaytoven, Lil C & London on da Track, you should know what to expect.\n\nFavorite track: Not Invited.\n34- The Avalanches \u2013 WildflowerIt\u2019s been more than a decade since The Avalanches has giving the patient people a full-length project. So when the group finally teased the people with the release of \u2018\u2019Frankie Sinatra\u2019\u2019 and it stated that MF DOOM and Danny Brown were involved you already know my hip-hop senses were vibrantly tingling and my anticipation for what this neo psychedelic group would provide this time round when it came to a full album.\n\nNot many have better quality ears for music than The Avalanches, evidently this album is heavily sample based and not many are able to incorporate samples into their music as fitting and creatively as this group. This is guaranteed to be one of the more smoother albums released in 2016 that will give you a divine listen. Previously, this group has released much more rough and louder funk sounds but with this album, which has been in the works since 2005, was beautifully crafted for your ears.\n\n\nFavorite track: Because I\u2019m Me\n\n\n\n\n33: Maxwell:blackSUMMERS\u2019nightThis continuous installment of the Black Summer night is a household favorite already. Maxwell does not constrain himself in the R&B realm as he touches corners of Jazz and Soul with his fantastic vocal ranges. As one of the pioneers of Neo Soul, which he certainly does not get enough credit for, the neo soul and funk implementations into the production gives for such a exhilarating listening session.\n\nIf you were to just play the instrumentals of this album throughout you would satisfied let alone adding Maxwell\u2019s poet like song writing. His ability to flow and ride the different types of instrumentations on this album makes him one of, if not the best in his lane. There are not too many albums released in 2016 with better vocal performances than this very one.\n\nFavorite track: Lake by the Ocean.\n32- Ro James- El DoradoRo James was not on everyone\u2019s radar before the release of his debut album ElDorado, but the album by the \u2018\u2019bad boy of R&B\u2019\u2019 became a big statement in the R&B scene in 2016. Covered with quality material from start to finish, this easily became my favorite Male R&B record of the year.\n\nFollowing the release of his radio friendly song \u2018\u2019Permission\u2019\u2019, a song influenced by artists like Miguel and Prince with the extreme use of electric guitar, it proved to be a taste of what this album would offer. Ro James does not sound like every other upcoming R&B artist, which is to his benefit as he is able to create his own sound with hints of gospel, rock and soul.  This album is filled with catchy lines that are not easy to forget as Ro James shows off his songwriting abilities making him have a very successful year with potential for many more years to follow.\n\n\n31:  Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds- Skeleton TreeNick Cave\u2019s name is synonymies with topics of tragedies and other depressive symptoms, so it should serve as no surprise if an entire album is in that same lane.\n\nAlthough this may not be very appealing, its a fair warning that once you experience this album, you could be left in a very depressive & confused state, especially when you consider that Nick Cave went through an unfortunate passing of his son in 2015 and that is reflected in the material this band produces with Skeleton Tree.  You can almost feel the mourning in Nick\u2019s voice as he translates this into a number of tracks. In some weird fashion, It\u2019s amazing how we can still find beauty in such a gloomy and dark album as this.\n\nFavorite track: Skelton Tree\n30: K Roosevelt-Neon HazeContinuing on the very spacey vibe following Nick Cave, this album is on the other end of the spacey spectrum.  K Roosevelt is able to be more colorful and lively as he unfolds his emotions out on contrasting production.\n\nThere is no doubting of K. Roosevelt\u2019s ability to sing (Do Me Now has become one of my favorite songs over the past years), but he seems to have taken more time on perfecting his production and sound on this project this time around. Previously, Roosevelt would have just thrown the simple generic R&B production to sing over but the dedication was of much more abundance in Neon haze. The production is very electrically charged that throws you up on a euphoric experience accompanied by the smooth, moving vocals by K.\nFavorite song: Hello.\n\n\n29: A Boogie & Don Q- Highbridge the Label: The Takeover Vol. 1There has been a steady shift in powers for the past decade or so over the demographic face of hip-hop.  Well documented, It was held by the East and West for the majority of the 90s until the South finally stood up and grabbed hip hop by the scuffs and they have not let go since.  Although the East and West still influence and are producing the big names such as Kendrick and the A$AP & Flatbush movement, every other person in Atlanta may as well claim to be a rapper nowadays as they are the frontrunners and the tastemakers for what the hip hop culture pushes.\n\nAtlanta has had another great year providing us with newer trending names like Lil Yachty and 21 Savage while Migos and their off springs (E.g. Rich the kid) all continue to make new trends, weather it\u2019s a dance your Childs fourth grade teacher attempts (dab), or the flow everyone gets \u2018\u2019lit\u2019\u2019 to. It reached to the point that even one the hottest songs of 2016 (Panda) could have been performed by an Atlanta rapper and no one would question its origins. Since then of course, we\u2019ve all learnt that Desiigner hails from the streets of Brooklyn, no fault of his, but as a teenager all he is influenced by is Southern movement so unsurprisingly, his sound is going to be of that same root.\n\nBobby Shmurda and his shooters put New York back on the map for a brief period but that didn\u2019t prove long lasting. Recently with the emergence of Young M.A with \u2018\u2019Ooouh\u2019\u2019 and nation wide hit records like \u2018\u2019Don\u2019t Run\u2019\u2019 by Casanova, its safe to say that New York is making a much louder noise than it has in the past few years, deadass. The duo of A Boogie and Don Q is exactly what you\u2019d want modern day hip-hop duo to come equip with. A Boogie on the one hand carries the catchy melodic tunes that you want to hear in the club, and on the other hand Don Q, much more familiar to the past New York scene is filled with bars in his arsenal.\n\nEventually these two will go in their own paths once they have gained enough popularity and leg space in the hip hop game but their collaborative effort is something I hope to see more often in the future. New New York!\n\nFavorite song: Not a Regular Person\n28: Joe Budden- Rage & The MachineJoe Budden is character you either hate dearly or love. To say he had a troublesome 2016 would be an understatement. It was a year filled with controversies, from his critique of Drake\u2019s Views to his awkward \u2018\u2019beef\u2019\u2019 with Hot 97. Although his fan base thoroughly enjoys Joe Budden\u2019s love lost tales of all the women that have done him wrong, it was time for something different, something more than just \u2018break up\u2019 music.\n\nYou could sometimes forget that Joe has phenomenal ink game, but if he was lacking in that he would never be part of the machine that is Slaughterhouse. Clever lines like \u2018\u2019If Fetty (Wap) is the face of New Jerz, then you see how badly we needed I\u2019\u2019 on the opening track of his latest album reminds you that he can wash up any of his peer when it comes to wordplay. With one of my favorite beat makers by his side, Araab Muzik, this was bound to be Joe\u2019s most aggressive album yet. It proved to be that indeed but the Rage that Joe fueled for this album does fortunately not end up coming out forced but rather measured and assured. Taking the stance of one of the older statesmen in the game, Joey comes across more mature than ever but that edginess and hardness does not fade away either.\n\nFavorite track: I Gotta Ask.\n27: Little Simz- Stillness in WonderlandEven though this album came out pretty late in the calendar year, it still plastered itself on this list quite easily. There had to be something special to Little Simz that the likes of Stormzy, Kendrick Lamar and the mogul himself Jay-Z rate the London rapper so very highly. Little Simz\u2019s qualities as an artist are undeniably and her latest effort will only propel her to higher and bigger heights.\n\nThis album consists of Simz\u2019s roots of grime, R&B and a recurring role and jazz and soul. At only the tender age of 22, Little Simz has show great creativity in her music and she has the potential to grow into one of the most sought after artists in the industry. She can\u2019t only rap her ass off over a variety of beats \u2018\u2019Low Tides\u2019\u2019 but she also has singing abilities in a unique sound that she can claim to be her own style \u2018\u2019Doorways\u2019\u2019. She is definitely one to watch.\n\nFavorite track: King Of Hearts featuring Chip & Ghetts\n26: Nav- The Introduction.All you auto tune-dreaded codeine sipping trap soul impressionists better step up because you\u2019ve got company. The 6ix have thrown up a lot of different big names in the last few years and next up is the mysterious vibe prince Nav.\n\nFollowing the release of Birds In The Trap by Travis Scott, one of the better songs on the album was titlted \u2018\u2019Beibs In The Trap\u2019\u2019 and a lot of the plaudit has to go to Nav. Not many have heard of Nav before this feature, perhaps because he was mainly just another beat maker, but it\u2019s a definite that many were rushing to check out his Soundcloud account following that.\n\nAfter the success of a number of tracks he released on Soundcloud he had to do the growing audience some justice and provide some sort of a release, this came in the form of The Introduction, which was filled with stand out moments, namely the Metro Boomin produced track \u2018\u2019Up\u2019\u2019. It seems like Young Metro certainly trusts him as the success of Up has the most sought out trap producer right now announcing him and Nav have a project dropping soon. This could be the breakthrough moment for young Nav, if not, it would not be surprising to see Nav on a chorus of a big name record in 2017. Career wise, weather Nav decides to follow the footsteps of many before him by joining the higher powers of Toronto in the shape of the OVO or even The Weeknd\u2019s XO, or he decides to do his own thing, he certainly has the potential to have a big 2017\n\nFavorite track: Ten Toes Down\n25- DJ Khaled- Major KeyDJ Khaled was someone you could not avoid in 2016 and just like the character himself, his music releases is also something you cannot avoid, as he seems to run your social media. Mogul talk aside, every once in a while DJ Khaled will provide you with a song filled with star names you admire that you end up liking or at least finding decent. Major Key is DJ Khaled\u2019s best effort by far and that is obviously down to the artists he put together around this time.\n\nA DJ Khaled album can be compared to the NBA all-star games, star studded and entertaining for the highlight reel but with not much at stake. The first five songs on this album have great replay value, Jay-Z and Future start it right with the energy you expect the rest of the album to follow with \u2018\u2018I Got The Keys\u2019\u2019 followed by \u2018\u2019For Free\u2019\u2019 by Drake, it\u2019s a safe bet to predict that these records were going to blow which they did. One of the finest moments of this album comes in the shape of Nas delivering \u2018\u2019Nas Album Done\u2019\u2019, over a gorgeous broken down Fugees sample Nas does his best effort to preview his new material hopefully coming in the near future. Followed by Big Sean and Kendrick snapping in a Control part two in a lyrical onslaught, the album seemed to be heading into unbeatable territory, but of course, from that track onwards, the album losses its way and goes on a downward dip with many mediocre pieces. Overall, the first halve of the record is what allows this album to make this list.\n\nFavorite track: Nas Album Done\n\n24: Meek Mill- DC42015 was a tough year for Meek Mill to say the least and the early days of 2016 seemed to be going in the same directions, it was countless Ls after Ls. People wondered if it was over for the Philly trapper, but Meek Mill stayed in there showed some signs of life, noticeably on his 4/4 Part 2 EP \u2018\u2019War Pain\u2019\u2019 record. Although that record came way too late to repair any damage to his career it helped set Meek up to start a new chapter. I\n\nIt took Meek Mill three whole years to finally give the streets the fourth installment of the Dreamchasers tape. Instagram snippet after another, the people were getting impatient with the delays, It was just time to drop it, but at the same time it had to contain material that was worth the wait as Meek Mill had no ground for error.\n\nOnce you press play on the first offering \u2018\u2019On The Regular\u2019\u2019 and you hear the sadistic O Fourtuna intro and the gunshots, (hopefully not aimed at Beanie Sigel), you could tell Meek Milly was back on his bully, we could all rest easy again. On the feature list, Meek Mill is clearly keeping in tune with the new names in the scene by working with 21 Savage, Don Q and Desiigner adlibs for instance. The ingredients that make up Meek Mill don\u2019t go missing on this project, as he was full of up tempo energy, high-toned rapping, Wraith and Rolex talk. DC4 definitely continued the theme of the Dreamchasers series.\n\nFavorite track: Litty featuring Tory Lanez\n23: James Blake: The Colour In AnythingWhen Beyonc\u00e9 made the world stop by dropping \u2018\u2019Lemonade\u2019\u2019 and the track list listing featured James Blake, I couldn\u2019t have been the only one hoping for a Blake album in 2016.  The three-year gap was sufficient as the previous teaser album made his listeners wanting more.\n\nAfter a number of listens to the 17 track album, though you will appreciate James\u2019s intimacy and darkness, you\u2019re left feeling that many of the songs feel unfinished and at the same time rather lost, which could be the goal James Blake is aiming for, after all Blake does seem lost in the artwork.  Blake could be challenging the listener by leaving it to the imagination and the listeners\u2019 own interpretation of his story (Ironically what I happen to be doing now) Overall this album makes for a beautiful listen and Blake\u2019s ideology of not being simple make this piece of art worthy of a mention.\n\nFavorite Track: I Need a Forest Fire featuring Bon Iver\n22- Kweku Collins- Nat LoveIt would be interesting to see how many people have heard of this artist before reading this list. Credit should go to me if you decide to check him out.\n\nThis will be your project if you\u2019re a fan of unorthodox, intimate hip-hop. Full of melancholic vibes that Kweku Collins pockets himself to, Kweku is able to provide you with the way he sees the world in an interesting manner and perhaps in a way you never saw things before. His voice compliments the instrumentation that he usually produces himself and his flows come across rather drowsy but pleasantly, this project actually more live and bouncy than you would think, with elements of Neo Soul, Trap and Funk this young artist should be gaining way more attention than he has currently attracted.\n\nFavorite track: Nat\u2019s Intro\n\n\n21: Kamaiyah- A Good Night In The GhettoIf YG is a contender for the MVP of the west coast right now in the terms in the male category, Kamaiyah is equivalent in the female front. This was one of the projects of 2016 that many went into expecting little or nothing. Firstly because Kamaiyah was not a name people were familiar with. You could be quick to presume judging from the cover art and the title of the tape of expecting another female rapper talking about killing and violence wanting to be the female Ice Cube. If you did then you judged the wrong book by its cover. Instead what you get from Kamaiyah is her giving you fun and happy vibes over old G funk beats as she gave us one of the most fun going releases of the year. Don\u2019t get it twisted though as Kamaiyah still lets you know very clearly she isn\u2019t one to play with from time to time.\n\nHer contribution to YG\u2019s \u2018\u2019Why You Always Hatin\u2019\u2019 banger just added to her Ws collection this year and this is the album to go to if you are in need to get into the party mood. Kamiayah carefree attitudes will make her very likeable as she continues to grow as an artist.  IT\u2019S KAMAIYAHHHHH.\n\nFavorite Track: How Does It Feel\n20- Travis Scott- Birds In The Trap Sing McKnightTravis Scott may have taken his time in finding and committing to his own sound, but the long titled peculiar Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight can be the final evidence needed to show that he has finally reached that stage of his career. An album that continues to grow on you, songs like \u2018\u2019Beibs in the Trap\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019Through The Late Night\u2019\u2019,  \u2018\u2019Pick Up The Phone\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Goosebumps\u2019\u2019 were constantly prominent soundtracks for most group of youth friends, weather the setting was a party atmosphere or a chilled night.\nAs if this album needed any more reassurance in its merit to be on this list, Travis\u2019s Rodeo experience on stage performance should kick any doubters out of the picture, or stage. This was a show I was lucky to experience in 2016 and rejuvenated my love for the project.\nSide note: I weighed this album up against Kanye West\u2019s Life Of Pablo as I considered which of these two should make the final list, although the latter is not one of the worst albums of the year, it\u2019s a great accomplishment to Travis that he outclassed one of his biggest influences at least in my ears.\nFavorite track: Through The Late Night featuring Kid Cudi\n19-  Kayatranda- 99.9%This Montreal producer has been making steady groundwork to serve us with 99.9%. Kayatranda seems to be aiming to try everything out in this project and this may not make for a very cohesive listen but the stand out tracks make this project very worthwhile.\n\nThe blend between the dance electronic vibe and hip-hop influence channels Kayatranda musical taste and he is able to combine the two rather well into his producing output. This isn\u2019t the most captivating project of 2016, but after all, Kayatrnda is a producer that does not require you to use every single bit of your attention to still be able to enjoy his work.\n\nFavorite track: Glowed Up featuring Anderson Paak\n18: Royce Da 5\u20199\u2019\u2019- LayersIf you claim to be a fan of \u2018\u2019hip hop\u2019\u2019, do yourself a favour and listen to \u2018\u2019Tabernacle\u2019\u2019. This has instantly become one of my favorite hip hop songs in history that it goes up there Slick Rick\u2019s Children Story and Immortal Technique\u2019s Dance with the Devil in terms of story telling rap songs. Royce da 5\u20199\u2019\u2019 seems to be getting greater by age and he will most probably go down in history without getting the credit he deserves. He caters to his followers and his followers appreciate his abilities, and this album is up there with his best yet.\n\nLayers will position you to a point in life where you have the best perspective on the major things in your life, from money, family (he goes into detail about his son that suffers from autism and how he deals with that) and society. Beforehand, a younger Nickel would have solely provided you with clever punch lines after clever punchlines, even though you will be impressed, its even more impressive that he now carries the full package and the different layers, pun intended, of making a good quality song.\n\nWe can all agree that hip hop is in its most eccentric state, with all the melodic and exuberant tunes at the forefront, which is not a criticism or a negative factor because at the end of the day there is a time and place for every type of hip hop expression. Layers though, is an album that you sit down with and if you were lucky enough to grow up listening to conscience hip hop music you will find this experience the most valuable of them all. The importance of a superb pen game cannot be underestimated and Layers by Royce Da 5\u20199 is what made many of us fall in love with this genre in the first place.\n\nFavorite track: Tabernacle\n\n\n17- De La Soul- And The Anonymous Nobody\u2026Many most have thought they were dreaming when they heard that De La Soul were producing a brand new album in 2016. Filled with uncertainty weather the group would attempt to force their old sound in a much more evolved times, De La Soul were able to fusion the old and new together beautifully as they reminded everyone why they will always be one of the best music makers period. De La Soul were known to be different and more vibrant even in their heydays. Surrounded with violent Hip Hop groups like Wu Tang and NWA previously, De La Soul always decided to be themselves, even though they expected backlash and being often seen as softer or \u2018\u2019weird\u2019\u2019 in the 90s.\n\nThis album is excellently put as De La Soul keep some of their roots and old school vibe but they don\u2019t ignore the possibility of incorporating the newer sound into their production and live instrumentation. \u2018\u2019Whoudeeni\u2019, featuring 2 Chainz (who would have ever thought) is a perfect example of the overview of the album, with 2 Chainz rhyming on his usual topics over production he would not normally be accustomed to. Fair warning, this is not an album you can rush through but it requires active listening to understand the complete concept and for you to appreciate the complete package. De La Soul have made a huge impact on people\u2019s lives when they were in the forefront of hip hop and those same people still\n\nFavorite track: Memory Of\u2026(US) featuring Estelle & Pete Rock\n16- Giggs- LandlordIf Danny Brown has a distinctive voice, Giggs is in the same bracket. One of the most respected names in the grime scene, Giggs flexes and delivers one of the best grime albums of the year.  \u2018\u2019Lock Doh\u2019\u2019 became a hit record with Giggs flowing over at the simplest of flows and lyrics, but this banger, aided with his unique raspy voice, will get everyone around you hype. The lead single is the accurate representation of the album, banger after banger and material to play at full volume.\n\nFavorite track: Whippin Excursion\n\n\n15. Ab Soul- Do What Thou Wilt (DWTW)The consensus agrees that Beyonc\u00e9 carried the women empowering music in 2016 which should come as no surprise, but what is rather surprising is that an alternative Hip Hop version of women empowering album would come from none other than the TDE\u2019S black lip pastor Ab-Soul.\n\nAfter going dark for what seemed a while, people started questioning Soulo\u2019s place amongst his TDE peers. Even though he may be the wildcard of TDE, no one would question Ab-Soul\u2019s potential to produce an excellent album, so when he finally came out of the woods with \u2018\u2019Huey Knew\u2019\u2019 you knew something that was worth the wait was on its way.\n\nThis is a very abstract album, it makes you dissect everything starting with the title of the album for starter and his countless manipulation of words.\nThe album deserves loud credits as Soul may have only a small number of talking points, mainly women, religion and drugs but he manages to find a new way to be creative and not allow the listener to get bored. Soul\u2019s does tend to be confusing as he can be conscience and ignorant in the space of two songs, but this album comes out much more balanced than his previous releases.\n\nFavorite track: God\u2019s A Girl\n14-1975- I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of ItManchester is known to be one the most talented cities musically and this it continues to provide artists, bands especially, that go down in history as the greatest.\n\nAlthough that\u2019s a lot of pressure for the 1975 to live up to, if they continue to produce fantastic funky pop album like their 2016 release, they will create their own lane. With Matthew Healy\u2019s awkwardly beautiful voice accompanied with electrifying instrumentations this is one of the finest pop albums of the year.\n\nFavorite track: Somebody Else\n13: Lil Uzi Vert- Lil Uzi Vs The WorldLil Uzi is really the modern day charismatic rockstar in every sense. His first project Luv is Rage is not the easiest pill to swallow, but once the pills do kick in, you cannot get enough of his squeaky, high-pitched melodic voice.\n\nLil Uzi vs The world is not the most groundbreaking or creative project released in 2016, in fact it is very simple, it still makes for a much more enjoyable listen than the rest of Lil Uzi\u2019s \u2018\u2019mumble rap\u2019\u2019 peer\u2019s releases.  The production, by Maaly Raw, Don Cannon and Metro Boomin is as colorful as the artwork for the tape, with cuts like P & Qs sounding like the theme song for the next Cartoon Network show. This is nowhere near the hardest put together project this year but the lightness and the smooth transitions from track to track makes this a favorite of mine.\n\nFavorite track: You Was Right\n12: The Get Down- Official Soundtrack- Various artistsA TV show like The Get Down where music is the vocal point and theme desperately needed some sort of a soundtrack, and it got one that did justice.\n\nThe Get Down for those living under a rock is a show focused on the roots of hip-hop and the emergence of this art form, and although many attempts of this have fell short previously, this is by far one of the best attempts. For one, it actually takes you back and you almost forget you\u2019re not an Afro kid from the Bronx as you get invested in the show. The soundtrack itself features a mix of throwback songs like \u2018\u2019Bad Girls\u2019\u2019 by Donna Summer and a bunch of original well-crafted records. This is the same composer that worked on the fantastic Great Gatsby soundtrack therefore Baz Luhrmann\u2019s pedigree is well documented and he can definitely hold this soundtrack high amongst his collection. With wise heads like Nas by his side Baz was able to deliver one of the best soundtracks of the year.\n\nFavorite track: Zeke\u2019s Poem (I Am the One)\n\n\n11- Mac Miller-Divine FemineYou may play this Mac Miller\u2019s Divine Feminine and not realize that there is a change of track as the album follows the same theme in terms of production and topic wise all the way through. Oddly, this doesn\u2019t come across too terrible or underwhelming. This has a lot to do with how honest and perhaps vulnerable Mac Miller comes across on this album. Mac expresses his thoughts on relationships that are helped to come to live sonically with the pretty stunning jazz influence throughout. No better example than the lead single \u2018\u2019Dang\u2019\u2019 featuring Anderson. Paak\n\nJazz is seemingly the major production influence in current hip-hop albums, with Chance The Rapper, Kendrick Lamar and Anderson Paak carrying heavily jazz influenced projects to name a few. This is a pleasing pattern that the culture is pushing. The Divine Feminine could be categorized as one of the few love hip hop albums made and although this won\u2019t be an album to always play, when the time is right, this will get you in that cuffing season vibe.\n\nFavorite track: God Is Fair, Sexy Nasty featuring Kendrick Lamar\n10- Kendrick Lamar-Untitled Unmastered.PIMP PIMP, HOORAY! When your jam sessions make it into the album of the year discussion, you know you\u2019re in the elite. Kendrick\u2019s ear for music gives him the edge over his peers in my opinion. His jazz and funk influence seems to be getting greater by each year that it has almost become a trademark of his.\n\nUntitled Unmasetered came as a pleasant surprise. The always-kicking knowledge Kendrick continues to offer the people jewels and is grateful enough to allow us a peek of his vision of the world and its issues. There is no other project quite like it in this list and following To Pimp a Butterfly, this can be pinned in perfectly as either a tease for what\u2019s to come or an end to this sound for Kendrick as he continue to grow as a person and artist.\n\nFavorite track: Untitled 07 (2014-2016)\n9- Skepta- KonnichiwaWith a very strategic BBK team behind him, Skepta seems to be very detailed and strategic with every move he makes as an artist, perhaps due to him currently holding the baton for the grime culture, but his moves have helped him crossover internationally as he continues to do big shows across the world and be acquainted with the likes of Kanye West and Drake.  After a number of delays, Skepta finally gave us Konnichiwa this year.\n\nThis only negative critique this album may carry is that a number of the cuts such as \u2018\u2019Shutdown\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2019That\u2019s Not Me\u2019\u2019 and a few more singles have been out for a year or even more so the quantity seemed lacking as the album only contained 12 tracks. Apart from that, everything else about the album is really well done. The grime influence is as heavy as it should, with aggression throughout on tracks like \u2018\u2019It Aint Safe\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2019 Man (Gang)\u2019\u2019. Not one for the most complex of lyrics, Skepta is always able to spray simple bars with his signature delivery and flow over complex production. This makes for a beautiful sounding combination.\n\nSkepta is definitely the leader of grime now and his every move is in the microscope but where Skepta can go from here can be groundbreaking for the UK.\n\nSidenote: Seeing Skepta perform this album live made me appreciate the material even more and this moved the album higher in my ranks than initially.\nFavorite track: It Ain\u2019t Safe Featuring Young Lord\n8- Run The Jewels \u2013 RTJ 3Better late than never. It seemed like the year would close and EL-P and Killer Mike had decided that their third installment of the Run the Jewels frenzy would come out in 2017, but just a few days before the end of the year, out of the blue, it was made for digital download right in the mist of the festive period. There is not a better project to close 2016 off than this fantastic piece of work.\n\nFollowing 2016\u2019s frantic year in terms of racial divide and many other political and social issues, you needed the wise heads of this duo to provide some sense and guidance to everything on current affairs through sounds. It\u2019s hard to bring up a better duo in the hip-hop demography that have consistently dropped three back-to-back projects that have been this well received. It\u2019s big credit to the chemistry and understanding the two MCs have off each other. Their timing when it comes to rhyming as to when they trade bars or fill each other\u2019s spaces never seems congested or force, it rather comes out well timed and coordinated as the two rappers feed off each other\u2019s energy phenomenally. This is the closest album that represents the state of the political state of America and EL-P and Killer Mike\u2019s views are perspectives everyone can take something valuable from. In terms of production, this album is on another level, its safe to say Run The Jewels now have their own sound and that sound is generated by their high tempo nature and their energetic production and rapping. This would be the suitable candidate for riot music, but its also important to observe the finer details in terms of their artistry, the duo can leave you amazed at their abilities.\n\nI have only had a handful of days to sit down with this album and you may question weather it came too late to make it to this list, but I\u2019ll have to disagree and stand firmly that this album is one of the standout albums of the year.\n\nFavorite track: A Report To The Shareholder Kill Your Masters\n7 -Danny Brown- Atrocity ExhibitionAfter hating his high-pitched repetitive voice after the first listen, XXX may be in my top 5 favorite albums in the past 6 years and that immediately made Danny Brown a household name in my playlist.  The Pharcyde aside it was hard to compare Danny Brown close to anyone else, this made him really unique. Old was a rather disappointing follow up project to such but his continuous experimentation of his sound will always lead to some hits and misses.\n\nAfter going quite for a while Danny Brown provided us with \u2018\u2019Pneumonia\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Really Doe\u2019\u2019 as teasers of what to expect, extraordinary music. This is the most complex hip-hop album of 2016 along with Death Grips in terms of production. It ranges from harsh & tight progressions and percussions in the production to raw, weird but exciting pitched flows provided by Danny Brown.  His explosive delivery throughout gives for the most thrilling listens that will exhaust you at the end, anchored by material that is so compelling. Danny Brown does exceptionally well to put everything together into an album that comes across in some way cohesive.\n\nFavorite track: Golddust\n\n6:Death Grips- Bottomless PitIs this a bunch of noise or geniuses at work? That\u2019s the priceless question around Death Grips. Experimental hip hop finds it hard to state a claim in the hip hop genre and it seems like Death Grips are the most successful of the bunch currently. Everything about Death Grips is odd but that oddness is their biggest attraction and they seem to be trying to stretch oddness to its full width.  With Death Grips, you\u2019re never going to get the same project back to back so you almost have to come into the project with zero expectations, after all they are always experimenting.\n\nThey mixed up all the right potions this time around with the release of Bottomless Pit, which starts off with even heavier production than usual, even for Death Grips, which should be a feat that is pretty deafening aye. \u2018\u2019The Money Store\u2019\u2019 was ground breaking as it introduced Death Grips, but this project is even more ground breaking in terms of experimenting with all versions and dimensions of sound and how challenging the trio decided to push. It\u2019s impossible to miss the alienated production of eerie guitar strings to the extremely powerful bass and drums. In terms of experience, the fifth track on this album \u2018\u2019EH\u2019\u2019 allows for a breather as it\u2019s toned down ever so slightly but that doesn\u2019t last long as the following track flips you totally upside down into the Bottomless Pit, true definition of a roller coaster experience.\n\nOverall this is a very excellent project that has little faults and those faults should be allowed because of the risk Death Grips take in terms of experimenting with sound. Side note, I wonder what state a person would be after playing this album followed by Danny Brown\u2019s Atrocity Exhibition.\n\nFavorite track: Eh\n\n\n\n5- Denzel Curry-ImperialPutting water bottle flip challenges aside for a moment, Miami powerhouse Denzel Curry is now one of the more popular up and coming new artists. Imperial is one the albums that captivates you from the first play, as soon as Denzel Curry\u2019s energetic alien like rapping starts off, he immediately gravitates to you, but he is able to add hooks full of hype that will fill you with energy.  Although he may get pretty repetitive and it would be difficult to listen to the same loud, sophisticated flow over a full-length album it was tolerably as this was the first project many outside his ever growing fan base have heard from Curry.  He does even tone it down on \u2018\u2019\u2019Story No Title\u2019\u2019 & \u2018\u2019Pure Enough\u2019\u2019 where Curry is being introspective which is something that will be interesting to see more off, as he carries a lot of compelling stories about his life.\n\nThis is an impressive effort by Denzel Curry and it would be interesting to see if Curry can diverse some more. He certainly carries sensational flow when rapping that gives him an edge over his peers in that department. In fact, its almost sounds inhumane how relentless Denzel Curry flows and at the same time his delivery is consistent throughout. A machine.\nFavorite track: Knotty Head featuring Rick Ross\n4- Schoolboy Q- Blank Face LPBetter and better. This should be the synonymous with Q\u2019s discography and Blank Face continues the growing upwards curve as Q gave us one of the better hip hop albums of 2016.\n\nApart from Q\u2019s and Miguel attempt to emulate the hit groovy record \u2018\u2019Studio\u2019\u2019 from Q\u2019s first studio album Oxymoron, every other record on this album is a favorite of many. Gang banging and drug dealing is not something we all relate to but this album makes you feel like you\u2019re walking down the Figg Side streets with 40 of your hood comrades. Sonically, the psychedelic production throughout this album makes for a quite enjoyable trippy listen aided by the grimey vocals by Q. Content wise, it was wise that Q did not decided to tell us the same stories as Oxymoron, but instead he offers refreshing tales of his whole life, from a child born into the street life to becoming one of the most prominent hip hop names is present time.\n\nFavorite track: By Any Means\n\n\n3- Childish Gambino- Awaken, My LoveIn the sports world of cricket, an all rounder is one of the most coveted assets to posses. Having quality further helps this versatility to be valuable to the team. A cricket expert would throw you the names of Imran Khan or Andrew Flintoff as examples. In the world of art, the name Childish Gambino or Donald Glover would be a fair enough comparison. With the success of his new show, Atlanta, Donald was already receiving rave reviews for work he did on the new hit show. Music was put aside and not many were predicting any music for a while, especially with him hinting of retiring as a rapper. Childish Gambino decided to show case his versatility by giving the people the most diverse album in his catalogue. With the success of Grammy Nominated Because Of The Internet, it was always interesting to see how Gambino would follow up. With Awaken, My Love, he followed up brilliantly, but in a whole different road. Because Of The Internet, despite it being a concept album, would still be in the Hip Hop category, but Gambino\u2019s latest album can be anything but hip hop. With heavy funk and soul production by his long time friend Ludwig, Gambino has made one of the best modern day funk album. With outstanding vocals, which was always present in his previous albums, Donald Glover sounds much more mature and enlightening than talking about being the awkward rich kid. The production on this album is something that should carry the biggest praise about this album and this is another moment that Donald is able to prove that his talents range across many many areas of entertainment\n\nFavorite track: Redbone\n2:Solange: A Seat at The TableIf this is your favorite album of the year, there hardly any reason to argue with that preference. The impact this album alone had speaks volumes of phenomenal piece of art Solange was able to deliver. Along with her sister, A Seat at The Table was the talk of the towns for a long duration of 2016.\n\nIt will be easy to compare Lemonade and A Seat at the Table for obvious reasons, but the latter detailed the Black American culture in a much more gorgeous and understandable fashion. Solange\u2019s angel like innocent voice accompanied by the neo soul, R&B production sound makes for the most soothing of listens. Solange is able to come across laid back while she touches on heavy political and personal topics from police brutality to racial issues. This is outstanding and works wonders as her message and words come across very powerful, loud  & clear.  With Master P helping narrate and put the pieces of the album together, songs like \u2018\u2019Cranes in The Sky\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Don\u2019t Touch My Hair\u2019\u2019 are one of the best records that have been made in years. This album is even more sensational as at the start of the year, no one would have predicted Solange to have the stand out year that she ended up having. Fully deserved.\n\nFavorite track: Don\u2019t You Wait\n\n\n1: A Tribe Called Quest- We Got It From Here... Thank You 4 Your ServiceWith rumors of members not getting alone and the unfortunate passing of Phife Dawg, the world was left thinking that was the last nail to the Tribe Called Quest album coffin cabinet, in the sense that we would never live to see another project by A Tribe Called Quest. So when murmurs of the group releasing a brand new album emerged, it was suddenly one of the best news the year would witness. Similarly to De La Soul and their hiatus, it was impossible to predict what a Tribe album would sound like in 2016. Was it going to be forced? Was it going to sound outdated? What\u2019s a Tribe album without Phife? These were many of the keen questions surrounding this album.\n\nThe answer to all those questions were simply answered by \u2018We Got It From Here\u2026 Thank You 4 Your Service\u2019\u2019. This album wastes no time in making a first impression, with the opening track \u2018\u2019The Space Program\u2019\u2019, as soon as the voices of Q Tip and Phife Dawg emerges with \u2018\u2019It\u2019s time to go left and not right\u2019\u2019 and that booming production comes through, you\u2019re just left in awe followed quickly by the nostalgic feels of the old Tribe. Not only does Tribe easily have mine and many others favorite album of the year, they take my favorite song of the year too with \u2018\u2019We The People\u2019\u2019 the drums in the production hit you so hard, combined with the trios views on the current state of America with race tensions. This could not have been more perfectly timed. Its exceptional that Tribe managed to reinvent themselves many years later but they still manage to give you the Tribe Called Quest feeling of the 90s.\n\nThis album is very special, there are so many layers to the sound and the message that Tribe are providing that the listener will continue to catch on new things after every listen. With actual Phife verses, it\u2019s very hard to find a detail on this album to criticize.\nEvery feature on the project did not seem out of place. Tribe take us on a time travelling trip, from the 90s dungeon dragon Busta Rhymes to Andre 3000 and Q Tip trading bars like it\u2019s a heaven match. And if Tribe were to feature one of the newer school rappers, it had to be Kendrick Lamar. This is an album that will become timeless.\n\nFavorite track: We The People\n\nWorthy mentions that missed out\nKanye West- Life of Pablo\nYG- Still Brazy\nKid Cudi- Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin'\nRoy Woods- Waking at Dawn\nBelly- Another Day in Paradise\nFuture- Purple Reign\nYoung Thug- SS3\nSturgill Simpson- A Sailor's Guide To Earth\nNAO-For All We Know\nIsaiah Rashad- The Sun's Tirade\nEden- I Think You Think Too Much Of Me\nThe Monkees- Good Times!\nWolfie- 8 Ball\nSky zoo & Apollo Brown- The Easy Truth\nRas Kass- Intellectual Property II\nTank- Sex, Love & Pain II\nYung Lean- Frost God\nTory Lanez- I Told You\nVic Mensa- There's A lot Going On\nZayn Malik-Mind of Mine2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/7225796", "artist_names": "YoungBoy Never Broke Again", "full_title": "No Where by\u00a0YoungBoy\u00a0Never Broke Again", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/4bd0d5d4e30d8bf239044a63f84ba989.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4bd0d5d4e30d8bf239044a63f84ba989.1000x1000x1.png", "id": 7225796, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 54639, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1667233150, "path": "/Youngboy-never-broke-again-no-where-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Youngboy-never-broke-again-no-where-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2021, "month": 9, "day": 24}, "release_date_for_display": "September 24, 2021", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Sep. 24, 2021", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/4bd0d5d4e30d8bf239044a63f84ba989.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4bd0d5d4e30d8bf239044a63f84ba989.1000x1000x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 70819}, "title": "No Where", "title_with_featured": "No Where", "updated_by_human_at": 1667233150, "url": "https://genius.com/Youngboy-never-broke-again-no-where-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/656173", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/7dd3e757d5443ca1878a43d46da4e783.1000x800x1.jpg", "id": 656173, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c1ebc0b5e4c5cc6774ed985d1397ad9d.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "y", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": true, "name": "YoungBoy Never Broke Again", "slug": "Youngboy-never-broke-again", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Youngboy-never-broke-again", "iq": 2116}, "artist": "YoungBoy Never Broke Again", "lyrics": "No Where Lyrics[Intro]\n(Pipe that shit up, TnT)\n(DMac on the fuckin' track)\n(Tuned Up)\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't wanna go nowhere, no, think it's best if we just stay at home\nMight as well leave out because your friends can't come 'round\nI wanted it to be just me and you all alone\nYou don't want me, I see, oh, la-di-da-di\nAll night, singin' the same song, lonely, singin' the same song\nOh, she all that I need, why don't she don't see?\nAll night, takin' my pain, was strong, all night, tryna see what's wrong\n[Verse 1]\nI know that I be trippin' when I tell you things I don't mean at all\nIt ain't my fault you thugged me, I'ma tell you this honestly\nDon't believe that it ain't someone out there to love me\nHate that my feelings got involved\n'Cause you just wanna shame me, you just wanna blame me\nNo shit you do can't troll me\nDamn, I miss the old me\nSo high that I might OD\nWish you was here to hold me\nDon't wan' leave, just wan' stay here and think\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't wanna go nowhere, no, think it's best if we just stay at home\nMight as well leave out because your friends can't come 'round\nI wanted it to be just me and you all alone\nYou don't want me, I see, oh, la-di-da-di\nAll night, singin' the same song, lonely, singin' the same song\nOh, she all that I need, why don't she don't see?\nAll night, takin' my pain, was strong, all night, tryna see what's wrong\n\n[Interlude]\nAll my cars push-start, don't play with me, no pushover\nWhy she try me?

derribarme, no puede ser amor\nNo estoy seguro de d\u00f3nde estabas tratando de enviarlo, no puede estar listo\nEse d\u00eda sonaste como una perra, \u00bfte apetece, huh?\nMaldita sea, \u00bfc\u00f3mo puedo perdonar as\u00ed?\nTengo que morir un mont\u00f3n de mierda solo para vivir as\u00ed\nTuve que follar con muchas chicas para tener un ni\u00f1o as\u00ed\nTuve que conseguir muchas cunas para conseguir una cuna como esta, negro\nEs por eso que me estoy moviendo todo elusivo\nEstos chicos en su \u00faltimo recurso y nos ha dado 'todo incluido\nHe estado esparciendo desde que CB estaba fragmentando los deuces, negro\nTu mierda fue muy boo-boo, excusas, excusas, negro\n\n[Verso 3: Lil Wayne]\nBrrrt, \u00bfpuedo hablar con negros maricones?\nSolo lo llamo como lo veo, ni siquiera estoy mirando, negro\nSolo camino como hablo y no les hablo a esos negros\nNo me muero de hambre, solo soy codicioso, todo lo que como son co\u00f1os de negros\nNo quiero ver a estos negros maricones, no pueden verme, negros maricones\nSigues hablando como si estuvieras comiendo, te dar\u00e9 balas, negeo\nIncluso podr\u00eda cocinar a un negro, toda mi hierba son galletas, negro\nEmpuja una bola 8 en su co\u00f1o como un feto para m\u00ed, negro\nTengo perras haciendo l\u00edneas, soy Adidas para ellas, negro\nMe sentenciaron, me tom\u00e9 un tiempo y fue m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil que simple\nSoy tan dif\u00edcil de comprender como una fiebre en invierno\nTengo mujeres en el Phantom con escote por la ventana\nCabello largo, muchos tatuajes y huelo a paquete\nSendero del dinero en el buen camino\nL\u00e1tigo ese gran cuerpo del Maybach como si fuera un peque\u00f1o Pontiac\nTodas mis cadenas se ven como serpientes, son algunos diamantes reales\nSaca mi martillo de su co\u00f1o, saca sus u\u00f1as de mi espalda\nNo me relajo, reacciono\nEn la balanza, mis bolsillos gordos, y a esta ballena, te gusta una hormiga\nSoy un perro, si eres un perro, entonces saca la cola por el culo\nY en esta code\u00edna, soy una tortuga, me dej\u00f3 en shock\nSoy el m\u00e1s caliente en el bloque de celdas, lo prometo\nPuedo volar para revisar mi buz\u00f3n, las facturas suenan como Jill Scott\nLa pastilla apareci\u00f3, esa casa en Hidden Hills en la cima de la colina\nSus o\u00eddos estallaron, ella lami\u00f3 mi piruleta y mis l\u00e1grimas, TunechiYou might also likeEmbed"},

Lyrics[Intro]\n(Enrgy made this one)\n\n[Verse 1: EST Gee]\nIf I ain't a young shiner, then what do you call that?\nFuckin' niggas' hoes, he mad, textin' in all caps\nBeef broad day, lay a nigga down, wave cap\nOverkill drill, spin at the building the wake at\nI'd be on what I'm on if I ain't rap\nAnd it really wasn't no stressin' 'til them members came back\nNiggas shook, family know we ain't playin' no more\nReal trapper, hit my dope like my hand was broke\nHe on Insta' with all the smoke, but call sayin' he don't\nYou get pistol whipped for some petty shit, your head be swollen\n[Verse 2: 42 Dugg]\nYeah, I'll hit your mans up\nSix hundred in hundreds, this shit there make 'em stand up\nRun around actin' tough, but you not, boy\nWhere the cold bitches lookin' for the hot boys?\nFifty in the glizzy, I run my city\nI ain't stoppin' shit, catch me if you can\nJust this month, sixty G's off pants\nI'm not, I'm not fuckin' no fan\nRidin' 'round with the top down\nSixty-five grams, ten of it is topside, stop lyin'\nI done made a couple M's a year without tryin'\n\n[Verse 3: EST Gee]\nOpps ain't had a sixty-day stretch without dyin'\nY'all got all that gangster shit down except slidin'\nYou ain't grind three days straight without hidin'\nGave Bands twenty-five, we ain't takin' no time\n\n[Verse 4: 42 Dugg]\nAyy, throw it off the glass, I'ma dunk it (Come here)\nSince y'all niggas apes, I don't mind killin' monkeys\nDon't step back\nWhite buffs, no ice, these plain\nPosted in the hood, all ten of my chains\nBig 30 on me, off an eight of that drank\nBitch said she in love with who?\nTen on the ground, 'bout a dub in the roof\nI'm a thug with a tool\nYou might also like[Verse 5: Rylo Rodriguez]\nPromoter called my phone when I left, couldn't get the pipe in\nEvery nigga 'round me having motion like a tight end\nBought Hot Wheels for my nephew, but I picked him up in my twin\nL with the coolant system, I bought it for a hotboy\nDid a feature with a nigga, 21, I'm walkin' shit like Deion\nHis city say he a rat, so I had to send him back a refund\nSay, Dot, that car right there look like it got the narcs in it\nWe the ones who ridin' 'round with more shots than the bartenders\nI bet you we'll get them niggas off your block\nI bet you we don't let them niggas get off no shots\nCome through, show a nigga how to slide\nLast night, I fucked a booster, woke up, text everybody size\nPlayed plain janes, but now I'm goin' bustdowns\nAnd Zelle the ho a rack to make sure that they touch down\n\n[Verse 6: EST Gee]\nShe ain't been ridin' with 'em when them bullets start flyin'\nCarpet same color snow if his head brown\nWe ain't got no pro team in Louisville, this a brick town\nA blicky in your glizzy with a switchy, you can't miss town\nNiggas really starved 'til we started bringin' that big round\nMix it with the rizzy, give that lil' dog a pit growl\nLike I ain't the one who started this shit\nLike I don't make sure them lawyers paid and them charges dismissed\n[Verse 7: Lil Baby]\nI'm short, but I'll lift a nigga ass up\nWay before coronavirus, I had them youngins masked up (Mask up)\nTired of soda bottles, I pour a four inside my cup (Straight)\nAnd you can't post an Instagram model one of us can't fuck (Haha)\nI be at practice, I got real skills, none of this shit luck\nTell the owner tell security chill, 'cause none of us gettin' touched\nWhen I find out where you niggas hide out, one y'all gettin' crushed\nI'm like, \"Fine, I might come out and vibe, but one of y'all gettin' fucked\"\nGot the finest car, one of a kind, I don't slow down for much\nI got twenty million cash now and still ain't near enough\nI'm goin' too crazy, I'm the Wayne of this new generation, niggas fugazi\nThey can't fuck with us no type of way, these niggas too lazy\nI'm cut from a different type of cloth, I don't know who raised 'em\nEvery time I pop out, I hear women screamin', \"Ooh, Baby\"5Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

never had a handout\n'Fore I let my people starve, I'll take it out your mouth\nThese bitches so quick to switch up\nI'm from the Lone Star, I don't need to clique up\nIt ain't directed, so it ain't respected\nStop droppin' clues 'cause I ain't no detective, bitch\nI'm tryna win, don't care how I do it, just know that I did it\nWhy you so worried 'bout what I be doin'?\nCountin' my money ain't makin' you rich\nTalkin' down on me don't make you the shit\nHow my name in your mouth more than your spit?\nI really encourage my haters to talk\nThrowin' that shade only keepin' me lit,

if it wasn't for my lil' partner\nThen the bullshit they be talkin' 'bout, I wouldn't even hear\nNew sports car go, \"Vroom,\" switch gears\nHey, how you? Goddamn, come here\nThought of goin' vegan, then again, I'm like, \"For what?\"\nI got ten karats each in my left and right ears\n'21 Tesla, I don't even gotta steer\nMy climax ain't even nowhere near

Willis in a train wreck\nI'm like tradin' in your car for a new jet\nI'm like havin' a boss getting upset\n'Cause you asked him for less on your paycheck\nI'm like doin' headstands with a broke

you think's probably unfeasible\nI've done already a hundredfold\nA hundredfold, it's probable\nThat I might press the envelope\nIdeas so astronomical\nSometimes I find 'em comical\nYeah,

wanted to know who you were hanging with\nWhile I was gone, I would've asked you\nIt's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass\nBut I felt it when I passed you\nThere's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me\nBut if it's all the same to you\nIt's the same to me\n\n[Chorus]\nSo we could call it even\nYou could call me \"babe\" for the weekend\n\u200b'Tis the damn season, write this down\nI'm stayin' at my parents' house\nAnd the road not taken looks real good now\nAnd it always leads to you and my hometown\n[Verse 2]\nI park\u0435d my car right between the Methodist\nAnd th\u0435 school that used to be ours\nThe holidays linger like bad perfume\nYou can run, but only so far\nI escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave\nBut if it's okay with you, it's okay with me\n\n[Chorus]\nWe could call it even\nYou could call me \"babe\" for the weekend\n\u200b'Tis the damn season, write this down\nI'm stayin' at my parents' house\nAnd the road not taken looks real good now\nTime flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires\nNow I'm missing your smile, hear me out\nWe could just ride around\nAnd the road not taken looks real good now\nAnd it always leads to you and my hometown\n\n[Bridge]\nSleep in half the day just for old times' sake\nI won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay\nSo I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends\nWho'll write books about me if I ever make it\nAnd wonder about the only soul\nWho can tell which smiles I'm fakin'\nAnd the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own\nTo leave the warmest bed I've ever known\nWe could call it
