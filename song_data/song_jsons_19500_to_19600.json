highly\nThinkin' \"You do you and I do me\"\nCrib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard\nMy niggas stand outside and pass cigars\nFilled with marijuana, laughin' hard\nThankful that they friend's a platinum

fastest\nGotta make it last, I hope you comfortable\nI need to get to you, you're like a '62\nA little work then it's curtains when I'm skrrting through\nCame through in the group, trying to leave in the coupe\nThat mean I gots a few, but I believe in you\nTrying to chase the cat, know I'm killing it, dawg\nYou ain't feeling me naw, that mean I don't need the roof\n[Bridge: Jeremih & Wale]\nYou remind me of my Jeep, I wanna ride it\nYou something like my car\nI got the keys to them, I need the keys to you\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]\nYou put on a show, you don't need no clothes\nGive me little

to love\nI know it sound crazy, but your miles scare me\nI'm just here cause your character good (truth be told)\nA good nigga is rare to her (truth be told)\nYou heard it all, but hear this love\nOne night with dude, I be the reason you cool\nSo let me know am I clear enough, yeah, what's up?\nWay I, way I, that's the way I think\nShawty straight like a concept on Bayonne Street\nIn the morning I slide over, she needs a ride I'm like\n\"Tight, let's keep it AMG\"\nSliding down, precipitating is straight\nTop down, let me kiss your physique\nI'm digging your fleek, I'm checkin' your gear\nCan tell you had a good year, spent a grip on your feet\nShe like when I drive it, I like it in park\nPull that thing over you likely to sore\nI got her floating like riding on stars\nSo I keep it GPS, see where this going\nNothing will stop it, I slide in no prob\nCh-ch-chop it, my swipe your parts\nSex is her weapon, my snake in her garden\nSo know when I'm not here the viper is on\nYou might also

What you tellin' me?\nI could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me\nI ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony\nThis ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]\nThey say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone\nThey say that your darkest hour come before your dawn\nBut there was something that I shoulda asked all along\nI'ma ask on the song\n[Bridge: Skylar Grey]\nSo does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)\nA thousand count and not a single thread of truth\nIf I was just another girl (Another girl)\nThen I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you\nThere's one thing I need to know\nSo call me when you're not so busy\nJust thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)\n[Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nDo you ever think of me when you lie?

hatin', soundin' funnier than Sinbad\nI'm ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse\nThis, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?\nWe the assholes that she warned you about\nWe just storm in your house, open doors through a cloud\nGot an assortment of style, just be sure that it's wild\n6:30 in the mornin' and there still ain't signs of slowin' down\nTwin sisters gettin' wasted, so they both are down\nIt's goin' down, I thought I told you, man\nIf you tryna party, let me see you raise your hand\n[Chorus]\nThere's a party on Fifth Ave. (Party on Fifth Ave.)\nHit me if you tryna go (Hit me if you tryna go)\nI can be there in like twenty, I'ma honk it and come runnin'\n'Cause we gotta hit the road (We gotta hit the road)\nMake you sure you got a clean shirt, clean

'tween me and you?\nWhen no one believe in you, I'm flyer than Beetlejuice\nDon't count on the sheep to snooze, I'm fucked up off weed and booze\nI party then sleep 'til noon, what every day people do\nSo haters see me improve, just give me a week or two\nSee when you read the news, my bitches all sleepin' nude\nMy rhyme talent is why my album is fly\nYour favorite record, you gon' put it aside\nThis that old school shit, soundin' good in the ride\nAnd fuck ten, I'm only countin' to nine\nSaid this that old school shit, soundin' good in the ride\nSo let's head out to the party, I'll drive\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a party on Fifth Ave. (Party on Fifth Ave.)\nHit me if you tryna go (Hit me if you tryna go)\nI can be there in like twenty, I'ma honk it and come runnin'\n'Cause we gotta

land perfect\nSome of us are lovers, most of y'all haters\nBut I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper\nSo love or hate me, I stay hate-free\nThey say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me\nI got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers\nAll hail Weezy, call it bad weather\nI stick to the script, I memorize the lines\nCause life is a movie that I've seen too many

"Translations\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06ccBeautiful Lyrics[Intro: Paul Rodgers]\nLately I've been hard to reach\nI've been too long on my own\nEverybody has a private world where they can be alone\nAre you calling me?\nAre you tryin' to get through?\nAre you reaching out for me?\nI'm reaching out for you\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI'm just so fucking depressed\nI just can't seem to get out this slump\nIf I could just get over this hump\nBut I need something to pull me out this dump\nI took my bruises, took my lumps\nFell down then I got right back up\nBut I need that spark to get psyched back up\nIn order for me to pick the mic back up\nI don't know how or why or when\nI ended up in this position I'm in\nI'm starting to feel distant again\nSo I decided just to pick this pen\nUp and try to make an attempt\nTo vent, but I just can't admit\nOr come to grips with the fact that\nI may be done with rap, I need a new outlet\nAnd I know some shit's so hard to swallow\nBut I just can't sit back and wallow\nIn my own sorrow, but I know one fact:\nI'll be one tough act to follow\nOne tough act to follow\nI'll be one tough act to follow\nHere today, gone tomorrow\nBut you'd have to walk a thousand miles\u2014\n[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]\nIn my shoes, just to see\nWhat it's like to be me\nI'll be you, let's trade shoes\nJust to see what it'd be like to\nFeel your pain, you feel mine\nGo inside each other's minds\nJust to see what we find\nLook at shit through each other's eyes\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nBut don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh\nThey can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so\nDon't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh\nThey can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor\nEverything's so tense and gloom\nI almost feel like I gotta check the temperature\nOf the room, just as soon as\nI walk in, it's like all eyes on me\nSo I try to avoid any eye contact\n'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door\nFor conversation like I want that\nI'm not lookin' for extra attention\nI just wanna be just like you\nBlend in with the rest of the room\nMaybe just point me to the closest restroom\nI don't need no fuckin' man servant\nTryna follow me around and wipe my ass\nLaugh at every single joke I crack\nAnd half of 'em ain't even funny, like, \"Ha!\nMarshall, you're so funny, man\nYou should be a comedian, goddamn!\"\nUnfortunately I am\nI just hide behind the tears of a clown\nSo why don't you all sit down?\nListen to the tale I'm about to tell\nHell, we don't gotta trade our shoes\nAnd you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles\u2014\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]\nIn my shoes, just to see\nWhat it's like to be me\nI'll be you, let's trade shoes\nJust to see what it'd be like to\nFeel your pain, you feel mine\nGo inside each other's minds\nJust to see what we find\nLook at shit through each other's eyes\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nBut don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh\nThey can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so\nDon't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh\nThey can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nNobody asked for life to deal us\nWith these bullshit hands we're dealt\nWe gotta take these cards ourselves\nAnd flip 'em, don't expect no help\nNow, I could've either just sat\nOn my ass and pissed and moaned\nOr take this situation in which I'm placed in\nAnd get up and get my own\nI was never the type of kid\nTo wait by the door and pack his bags\nAnd sat on the porch and hoped and prayed\nFor a dad to show up who never did\nI just wanted to fit in\nIn every single place, every school I went\nI dreamed of being that cool kid\nEven if it meant actin' stupid\nAunt Edna always told me:\n\"Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.\"\nMeanwhile, I'm just standin' there\nHoldin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this\n'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen\nStop sign pole at eight-years-old\nI learned my lesson then, 'cause I wasn't\nTryin' to impress my friends no mo'\nBut I already told you my whole life story\nNot just based on my description\n'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'\nIt's probably a 110% different\nI guess we would have to walk a\nMile in each other's shoes at least\nWhat size you wear? I wear 10's\nLet's see if you can fit your feet\u2014\n[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]\nIn my shoes, just to see\nWhat it's like to be me\nI'll be you, let's trade shoes\nJust to see what it'd be like to\nFeel your pain, you feel mine\nGo inside each other's minds\nJust to see what we find\nLook at shit through each other's eyes\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nBut don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh\nThey can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so\nDon't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh\nThey can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so\n\n[Bridge: Paul Rodgers, Eminem]\nLately I've been hard to reach\nI've been too long on my own (Oh)\nEverybody has a private world\nWhere they can be alone (So)\nAre you calling me?\nAre you tryin'g to get through? (Oh)\nAre you reaching out for me?\nI'm reaching out for you (So)\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nYeah\nTo my babies:\nStay strong\nYour Dad'll be home soon\nAnd to the rest of the world:\nGod gave you shoes\nTo fit you\nSo put 'em on and wear 'em\nBe yourself, man\nBe proud of who you are\nEven if it sounds corny\nDon't never let no one tell you\nYou ain't beautiful (So-oh-oh-oh-oh)369Embed"}, {"_type":

Lyrics[Intro: Travie McCoy]\nSee, here's the thing\n\n[Hook: Patrick Stump]\nWe have to take our clothes off (so sexy)\nWe have to party all night\nWe have to take our clothes off\nTo have a good time, oh no no no\n\n[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]\nExcuse me miss\nI couldn't help but to notice how alone you are\nI dig the attitude and how you're acting like you own the bar\nGot me flashing keys and I don't even own a car\nLike you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are\nI'm trying to see how your lips feel\nOh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal\nOh, you've never heard of me\nThat sounds absurd to me\nThe way you stole my attention was flat out burglary\nWhat do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can\nPossibly reconvene and play some Naked Peek-A-Boo\nCause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through\nAnd it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too\nSuch an angel with a devilish angle\nAnd quite the certified sweet talker\nAnd you're buying every line of it girl\nAnd I don't really blame you\nIf I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too\n[Hook: Patrick Stump]\nWe have to take our clothes off (so sexy)\nWe have to party all night\nWe have to take our clothes off\nTo have a good time, oh no no no\n\n[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]\nNow here's another barn burner for the slow learners\nPut your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus\nNext stop, right around the corner from your momma live\nNo turning back so you better buckle up\nShit, don't be concerned with mine\nI feel like a Speak-n-Spell way I got you learning my lines\nFine, pull the string, replay that shit\nI change my name to \"did he really just say that shit?\" (Yep)\nI'll take a mile if you let me\nSix-five, two hundred plus and so sexy\nMy legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate\nTo hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me\nAnd I've been trying to never mind it man\nBut every time I get a new number, she finds it damn\nAnd you thought you had it sewn up\nUntil right around amazing o'clock when I showed up\n\n[Hook: Patrick Stump]\nWe have to take our clothes off (so sexy)\nWe have to party all night\nWe have to take our clothes off\nTo have a good time, oh no no no\nYou might also like[Bridge: Travie McCoy]\nGot chicks, all hot chicks\nIndie-rock chicks, and hip-hop chicks\nSlim chicks, round chicks\nBlack, white, yellow, and brown chicks\nGot chicks, all hot chicks\nIndie-rock chicks, and hip-hop chicks\nSlim chicks, round chicks\nBlack, white, yellow, and brown chicks\n\n[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]\nGood grief girl, you're giving me goosebumps\nStanding there in your underwear and new pumps\nIt's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you\nHonestly I could easily replace you\nIt's not a scam girl\nThat's how I am girl\nPeter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl\nIt's clear I'm only here for good clean fun\nShut up and kiss me like the antidotes under my tongue\nWhoa\n\n[Hook: Patrick Stump]\nWe have to take our clothes off\nWe have to party all night\nWe have to take our clothes off\nTo have a good time, oh no no no\nWe have to take our clothes off (so sexy)\nWe have to party all night\nWe have to take our clothes off\nTo have a good time, oh no no no\n[Bridge: Travie McCoy]\nGot chicks, all hot chicks\nIndie-rock chicks, and hip-hop chicks\nSlim chicks, round chicks\nBlack, white, yellow, and brown chicks\nGot chicks, all hot chicks\nIndie-rock chicks, and hip-hop chicks\nSlim chicks, round chicks\nBlack, white, yellow, and brown

and I both know what it really is\nBut still, you know what I'm sayin' B\n\n[Verse 1]\nRan across a picture you took of me and it got me thinkin'\nBout how we used to be\nIt was just you and me\nStill hear you say you love me, put no one else above me\nBut that was back then, now you're just a memory\nIf I didn't go away to school then where would we be\nProbably still together and somewhere happy\nIf I'm supposed to be moved on, in a new relationship strong\nThen why are you still hauntin' me\n[Hook]\nThey say if you love something let it go\nAnd if it comes back then that's how you know\nI got to the stop light then I made four rights\nNow I'm back where I started and you're back in my life\nThe further I go the closer I get back to you\nI say I moved on til' I'm reminded of you\nCan somebody help me\nHelp me get out of this circle\nOut of this circle\n\n[Verse 2]\nI drove past your house the other day\nI didn't even mean to, I went the wrong way\nI ain't seen your mama in a while\nWhen she looked at me she smiled\nAnd asked me if I'm doin' okay\nTook everything I had not to bring up your name\nAnd wonder if you came home for the holidays, yeah\nShe asked if I could stay awhile cause you had come in town\nAnd you were just five minutes away\n\n[Hook]\nIf you love something let it go\nAnd if it comes back then that's how you know\nI got to the stop light then I made four rights\nNow I'm back where I started and you're back in my life\nThe further I go the closer I get back to you\nI say I moved on til' I'm reminded of you\nCan somebody help me\nHelp me get out of this circle\nOut of this circle\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nNow everybody that's listenin' to this\nIf you got that person that makes you wonder, \"what if?\"\nLet me hear you say yeah, say yeah\nSay yeah, oh yeah\nIf you understand how I feel\nThen grab that person, gotta let them know what's real\nLet me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah hey\n\n[Hook]\nIf you love something let it go\nAnd
