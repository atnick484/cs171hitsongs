That sucks for you\n'Cause this is Bubba's moment - I put my mother on it\nI said my momma; it seems as if I love her don't it?\nSo buckle up, cause it's gon' get bumpy\nI call my girlfriends Betty's, and my shits grumpies\nThat Bubba talk - gotcha open wide\nI giggle outside the booth; but ain't no joke inside\nThis is complicated - at least to y'all it is\nJust let me sell fifty million, then I'll call it quits\nBut until that day, y'all in deep doo doo\nI never once saw you crank it cause I just leap through you\nWhat you need to do, is just admit you love me\nThe South has always been Dirty but now it's gettin' ugly\n[Chorus: Timbaland]\nUgly - in here!\nHuh, in here!

That's just Timmy talkin'\nGo 'head throw dem' bows - fuck it, break a bottle\nLet's be honest none of us will ever date a model\nSo let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions\nIf you scared, then just forget what we discussin'\nThis that new South - take a picture of me\n'Cause I'm a fuckin' legend, and this is gettin' ugly\nYou might also like[Chorus: Timbaland]\nUgly - in here!\nHuh, in here!

out, and they're training and they're getting in shape but the strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. The only reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for when we have to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing I don't get about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt because he has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't even think about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of these locks you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff is safe.\n\n\nGYM LOCKER ROOM\n\nKRAMER: Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.\n\nGEORGE: Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.\nJERRY: I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.\n\nGEORGE: Oh I'm a chucker.\n\nJERRY: That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.\n\nGEORGE: I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!\n\nJERRY: You chuck.\n\nGEROGE: Kramer am I a chucker?\n\nKRAMER: You're a chucker.\n\nGEORGE: All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?\n\nJERRY: Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.\n\nKRAMER: Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.\n\nJERRY: Believe me I didn't see anything.\n\nKRAMER: Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?\n\nJERRY: No, did you?\nKRAMER: Yeah, I snuck a peak.\n\nJERRY: Why?\n\nKRAMER: Why not? hey what about you George?\n\nGEORGE: yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.\n\nJERRY: I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.\n\nKRAMER: Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.\n\nJERRY: All right\n\nKRAMER: Have a good one.\n\nJERRY: All right\n\nGEORGE: See ya.\n\n(Kramer exits)\n\nGEORGE: look at this guy.

You should come in.\n\nGEORGE: But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.\n\nKEITH: You know, I live on the East Side.\n\nJERRY: I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.\n\nKEITH: or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee\n\nJERRY: Oh. that would be great.\n\nGEORGE: Uh, it's only a matter of time.\n\nKEITH: Who's this chucker?\n\nMONKS\n\nJERRY: It's been three days and he hasn't called.\n\nELAINE: Well maybe you should call him.\n\nJERRY: I can't ...

If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.\n\nELAINE: Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.\n\nJERRY: I can't stand these guys.

Maybe he's been out of town?\n\nJERRY: Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?\n\nELAINE: Why don't you just go ahead and call him?\n\nJERRY: I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?\n\nELAINE: Just ask him if he wants a to get together.\n\nJERRY: For what dinner?\n\nELAINE: Dinner's good.\n\nJERRY: Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? ..

Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.\n\n(Changes lanes)\n\nGEORGE: You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -\n\nCABBY: That's it GET OUT!!\n\nGEORGE: Get out?\n\nCABBY: Get out of my cab.\n\nGEORGE: Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab\n\n(Cabby gets out)\n\nGEORGE: No, no! You can't throw me out\n\n(Wrestling in cab)\n\nJERRY'S APARTMENT\n\nJERRY: Hellooo Newman.\n\nKRAMER: I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.\n\nNEWMAN: I despise him.\n\nELAINE: Why?\n\nNEWMAN: Why? I'll tell you why...\n\nKRAMER: Let me tell it ..\n\nNEWMAN: No, you can't tell it ..\n\nKRAMER: You always tell it ..\n\nNEWMAN: All right, tell it.\n\nKRAMER: Ja ja ja - just tell it\n\nNEWMAN: June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.\n\nKRAMER: Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, \" Nice game pretty boy.\". Keith continued past us up the ramp.\n\nNEWMAN: A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.\n\nELAINE: What was it?\n\nKRAMER: He spit on us.... and I screamed out, \"I'm hit!\"\n\nNEWMAN: Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.\n\nELAINE: Wow! What a story.\n\nJERRY: Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.\n\nJERRY: Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.\n\n\nNEWMAN: Well that's the way it happened.\n\nJERRY: What happened to your head when you got hit?\n\nKRAMER: Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left\n\nJERRY: Again\n\nKRAMER: Back and to the left\n\nJERRY: Back and to the left Back and to the left\n\nELAINE: So, what are you saying?\n\nJERRY: I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.\n\nELAINE: So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.\n\nJERRY: But that is not what they would have you believe.\n\nNEWMAN: I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)\n\nKRAMER: Wait, wait, (Exits)\n\nJERRY: The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.\n\n(George runs in)\n\nGEORGE: (Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?\n\nJERRY: No. What happened to you?\n\nGEORGE: Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer \"Vandelay Industries\".\n\nJERRY: I'm Vandelay Industries?\n\nGEORGE: Right.\n\nJERRY: And what is that?\n\nGEORGE: You're in latex\n\nJERRY: Latex? And what do I do with latex?\n\nGEORGE: Ya manufacture it.\n\nELAINE: Here in this little apartment?\n\nJERRY: And what do I say about you?\n\nGEORGE: You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.\n\nJERRY: I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?\n\nGEORGE: Right.\n\nJERRY: I don't think so. Why would I do that?\n\nGEORGE: Because I asked you to.\n\nJERRY: If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.\n\n(Buzzer)\n\nJERRY: Yeah.\n\nKRAMER: It's Keith.\n\nJERRY: All right we're coming down.\n\nGEORGE: KEITH HERNANDEZ:?\n\nJERRY: Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.\n\nGEORGE: Where are you goin?\n\nELAINE: He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?\n\nJERRY: That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.\n\nGEORGE: What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)\n\nKEITH'S CAR\n\nJERRY: Well that was really fun, thanks.\n\nKEITH: Yeah, it really was.\n\nJERRY(MIND): Should I shake his hand?\n\nJERRY: Well, ...\n\nKEITH: UH, do you want to catch a movie this weekend?

Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.\n\nGEORGE: So, uh, you gonna see him again?\n\nJERRY: He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.\n\nGEORGE: Wow!

heavenly tune\nWhen I think about heaven\nThen I think about angels\nWhen I think about angels\nI think about you\n[Verse 2:]\nThe taste of sugar sure reminds me of your kiss\nI like the way that they both linger on my lips\nKisses remind me of a field of butterflies\nIt must be the way my heart is fluttering inside\nBeautiful distraction\nYou make every thought a chain reaction\n\n[Chorus:]\nWhen I think about rain\nI think about singing\nWhen I think about singing\nIt's a heavenly tune\nWhen I think about heaven\nThen I think about angels\nWhen I think about angels\nI think about you\n\nAnywhere I go, anything I do\nEverything around me, baby\nMakes me think of you\n\n[Chorus:]\nWhen I think about rain\nI think about singing\nWhen I think about singing\nIt's a heavenly

one knows\nWe don't talk about\nThe little things that we do without\nWhen that whole mad season comes around\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo, why ya gotta stand there looking like the answer now?\nIt seems to me you'll come around\n\n[Chorus]\nI need you now, do you think you can cope?\nYou figured me out, that I'm lost and I'm hopeless\nI'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken\nI come undone, in this mad season\n\n[Verse 3]\nI feel stupid\nBut I think I've been catching on\nI feel ugly\nBut I know I still turn you on\nYou've grown colder now\nTorn apart, angry, turned around\nWhat that whole mad season knock you down?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo are you gonna stand there, are you gonna help me out?\nWe need to be together now\n\n[Chorus]\nI need you now, do you think you can cope?\nYou figured me

just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I don't know why they say grown men don't cry\nI don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry\n\n[Verse 3]\nI am sitting here with my kids and my wife\nAnd everything that I hold dear in my life\nWe say grace and thank the Lord\nGot so much to be thankful for\nThen it is up the stairs and off to bed and my

do\nNever knew that I could feel this much\nBut this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you\nIs more than a reaction to your touch\nIt's a perfect passion\nAnd I can't get enough\n\n[Chorus]\nThe way you look, the way you laugh\nThe way you love with all you have\nThere ain't nothing 'bout you\nThat don't do something for me\nThe way you kiss, the way you cry\nThe way you move when you walk by\nThere ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)\nThat don't do something for me\n[Verse 2]\nIn my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows\nThat never knocked me off my feet\nAll you gotta do is smile at me and down I go\nAnd baby, it's no mystery\nWhy I surrender\nGirl, you got everything\n\n[Chorus]\nThe way you look, the way you laugh\nThe way you love with all you have\nThere ain't nothing 'bout you\nThat don't do something for me\nThe way you kiss, the way you cry\nThe way you move when you walk by\nThere ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)\nThat don't do something for me\n\n[Bridge]\nI love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought\nYour smile, you lips and girl, the list goes on and on and on\n\n[Chorus]\nThe way you look, the way you laugh\nThe way you love with all you have\nThere ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)\nThat don't do something for me\nThe way you kiss, the way you cry\nThe way you move when you walk by\nThere ain't nothing 'bout you\nThat don't do something for me (Something for me)\nThe way you look, the way you laugh\nThe way you love with all you have\nYour dance, your drive, you make me feel alive\nThe way you talk, the way you tease\nBy now I think you see\nThere ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)\nThat don't do something for me\n(Something for me)See Brooks & Dunn LiveGet

make me some homemade soup\nI'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth\nIt's neither drink nor drug induced, no\nI'm just doin' alright\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's a great day to be alive\nI know the sun's still shining\nWhen I close my eyes\nThere's some hard times in the neighborhood\nBut why can't every day be just this good\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's been fifteen years since I left home\nAnd said good luck to every seed I'd sown\nGave it my best and then I left it alone\nI hope they're doin' alright\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow I look in the mirror and what do I see\nA lone wolf there starin' back at me\nLong in the tooth but harmless as can be\nLord I guess he's doing alright\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's a great day to be alive\nI know the sun's still shining\nWhen I close my eyes\nThere's some hard times in the

cruise\nMight even grow me a Fu-Manchu\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's a great day to be alive\nI know the sun's still shining\nWhen I close my eyes\nThere's some hard times in the neighborhood\nBut why can't

felt like electricity\n\n[Chorus]\nYou shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that\n'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at\nWe'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around\nAnd around and around and around\nThey're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love\nThey'd never believe we're just friends\nWhen you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that\nIf you do baby kiss me again\n[Bridge]\nEverybody swears we make the perfect pair\nBut dancin' is as far as it goes\nGirl you've never moved me quite\nQuite the way you moved me tonight\nI just wanted you to know\nI just wanted you to know\n\n[Chorus]\nYou shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that\n'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm

1]\nWhat's a man to do when he just can't take no more?\nWhat's a man to do?\nWhat am I to do when my heart leads me to the door?\nNow I've tried and tried again\nBut now this is the end\nTell me what's the use of holding on\nIf we can't be friends\n[Chorus]\nI'm emotional\nAnd I can't let go\nI am trying to hold on to you\n(I'm trying to hold on to you)\nThough it hurts me so\nGotta let you know\nThat the love we once shared now is through\nSay goodbye to you\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou seem to hurt me purposely\nI didn't understand it\nOh girl, why me?\nI had no choice\nWhat was best for us\nWas to terminate our love and be free\n\n[Bridge 2]\nWhat's a man to do when he just can't take no more?\nOh, what's a man to do?\nWhat am I to do when my heart leads me to the door?\nNow we've tried and tried again\nBut now this is the end\nTell me what's the use of holding on\nIf we can't be friends\nYou might also like[Chorus (x2)]\nI'm emotional\nAnd I can't let go\nI am trying to hold on to

you love her\n[Verse 2]\nBrother I've been right where you are now\nAnd my heart was broke\n'Cause I never spoke\nThose healing words out loud\nBut I've learned my lesson well\nAnd now every
