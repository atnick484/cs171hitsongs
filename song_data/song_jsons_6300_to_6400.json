everything so clear\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight\nYou're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night\nAnd I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I can't fight this feeling anymore\nI've forgotten what I started fighting for\nIt's time to bring this ship into the shore\nAnd throw away the oars, forever\nCause I can't fight this feeling anymore\nI've forgotten what I started fighting for\nAnd if I have to crawl upon the floor\nCome crashing through your door\nBaby, I can't fight this feeling anymore\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you\nI've been running round in circles in my mind\nAnd it always seems that I'm following you, girl\n'Cause you take me to the places that, alone, I'd never find\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight\nYou're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night\nAnd I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might\nSee

voice in the hall outside\nAnd hope that it just passes by\nSome people live with the fear of a touch\nAnd the anger of having been a fool\nThey will not listen to anyone\nSo nobody tells them a lie\n\n[Bridge]\nI know you're only protecting yourself\nI know you're thinking of somebody else\nSomeone who hurt you\n[Verse 2]\nBut I'm not above making up for the love\nYou've been denying you could ever feel\nI'm not above doing anything\nTo restore your faith if I can\nSome people see through the eyes of the old\nBefore they ever get a look at the young\nI'm only willing to hear you cry\nBecause I am an innocent man\n\n[Chorus]\nI am an innocent man\nOh, yes I am\n\n[Verse 3]\nSome people say they will never believe\nAnother promise they hear in the dark\nBecause they only remember too well\nThey heard somebody tell them before\nSome people sleep all alone every night\nInstead of taking a lover to bed\nSome people find that it's easier to hate\nThen to wait anymore\n\n[Bridge]\nI know you don't wanna hear what I say\nI know you're gonna keep turning away\nBut I've been there\nSee Billy Joel LiveGet tickets as low as $91You might also like[Verse 4]\nAnd if I can survive I can keep you alive\nI'm not above going through it again\nI'm not above being cool for a while\nIf you're cruel to me, I'll understand\nSome people run from a possible fight\nSome people figure they can never win\nAnd although this is a fight I can lose\nThe accused is an innocent man\n\n[Chorus]\nI am an innocent man\nOh, yes I am\nAn innocent man\n\n[Bridge]\nYou know you only hurt yourself out of spite\nI guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight\nThat's your decision\n\n[Verse 5]\nBut I'm not below anybody I know\nIf there's a chance of resurrecting a love\nI'm not above going back to the start\nTo find out where the heartache began\nSome people hope for a miracle cure\nSome people just accept the world as it is\nBut I'm not willing to lay down and die\nBecause

I'm sure that you think you got it all under control\nYou don't want somebody telling you the way to stay in someone's soul\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nYou're a big boy now and you'll never let her go\nBut that's just the kind of thing she ought to know\n\n[Chorus 1]\nTell her about it, tell her everything you feel\nGive her every reason to accept that you're for real\nTell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams\nLet her know you need her, let her know how much she means\n\n[Verse 3]\nListen boy it's not automatically a certain guarantee\nTo ensure yourself you've got to provide communication constantly\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nWhen you love someone, you're always insecure\nAnd there's only one good way to reassure\n\n[Chorus 2]\nTell her about it, let her know how much you care\nWhen she can't be with you, tell her you wish you were there\nTell her about it, every day before you leave\nPay her some attention, give her something to believe\n\n[Bridge 2]\nCause now and then she'll get to worrying\nJust because you haven't spoken for so long\nAnd though you may not have done anything\nWill that be a consolation when she's gone?\nSee Billy Joel LiveGet tickets as low as $91You might also like[Verse 4]\nListen boy it's good information from a man who's made mistakes\nJust a word or two that she gets from you could be the difference that it makes\n\n[Pre-Chorus

accept that you're for real\nTell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams\nLet her know you need her, let her know how much she means\n\n[Outro]\nTell her about it, tell her how you feel right now\nJust tell her about it, the girl don't want to wait too long\nYou got to tell her about it, tell her now and you won't go wrong\nYou got to tell her about it, before it gets too late\nYou've got

the Loose LyricsOne day you feel quite stable\nThe next you're coming off the wall\nBut I think that you should warn me\nIf you start heading for a fall\nI see the problem start\nI watch the tension grow\nI see you keeping it to yourself\nAnd then instead of reaching conclusions\nI see you reaching for something else\n\nNo one can stop you now\nTonight you're on the loose\nNo one to tell you how\nTonight you're on the loose\nNo one can stop you now\nTonight you're on the loose\nNo one to tell you how\nTonight you're on the loose\n\nI see no harm or danger in escaping\nIf the m\u0435thod suits the style\nWe put th\u0435 mind on idle\nAnd let the others take it for awhile\nWhen the pace is too fast\nAnd I think I won't last\nYou know where I'll be found\nI'll be standing here beside myself\nGetting ready for the final round\n\nNo one can stop me now\nTonight I'm on the loose\nNo one to tell me how\nTonight I'm on the loose\n\nNo one can stop me now\nTonight I'm on the loose\nNo one to tell me how\nTonight I'm on the loose\n\nThe time we feel most stable\nIs the time we're coming off the wall\nAnd there's every indication\nWe may be heading for a fall\nSo let the problems start\nAnd let the tension grow\nWe'll be keeping it to ourselves\nAnd while they're busy reaching their conclusions\nWe'll be reaching for something else\nYou might also likeNo one can stop us

friends were my accusers\nAnd in my head\nLost before I'd begun\n[Chorus 1]\nI had a dream\nBut it turned to dust\nWhat I thought was love\nThat must have been lust\nI was living in style\nWhen the walls fell in\nWhen I played my hand\nI looked like a joker\nTurned around\nFate must have woke her\nBecause lady luck she was\nWaiting outside the door\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI'm winning\nI'm winning\nI'm

Eve\nI stole behind her in the frozen foods\nAnd I touched her on the sleeve\nShe didn't recognize the face at first\nBut then her eyes flew open wide\nShe went to hug me and she spilled her purse\nAnd we laughed until we cried\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe took her groceries to the checkout stand\nThe food was totaled up and bagged\nWe stood there lost in our embarrassment\nAs the conversation dragged\nWent to have ourselves a drink or two\nBut couldn't find an open bar\nWe bought a six-pack at the liquor store\nAnd we drank it in her car\n[Chorus]\nWe drank a toast to innocence\nWe drank a toast to now\nAnd tried to reach beyond the emptiness\nBut neither one knew how\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe said she'd married her an architect\nWho kept her warm and safe and dry\nShe would have liked to say she loved the man\nBut she didn't like to lie\nI said the years had been a friend to her\nAnd that her eyes were still as blue\nBut in those eyes, I wasn't sure if I\nSaw doubt or gratitude\nShe said she saw me in the record stores\nAnd that I must be doing well\nI said the audience was heavenly\nBut the traveling was hell\n\n[Chorus]\nWe drank a toast to innocence\nWe drank a toast to now\nAnd tried to reach beyond the emptiness\nBut neither one knew how\nWe drank a toast to innocence\nWe drank a toast to time\nReliving in our eloquence\nAnother 'auld lang syne'\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nThe beer was empty and our tongues were tired\nAnd running out of things to say\nShe gave a kiss to me as I got out\nAnd I watched her drive away\nJust for a moment I was back at school\nAnd felt that old familiar pain\nAnd as I turned to make my way back home\nThe snow turned into rain\n\n[Saxophone Solo]3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/99385",

lookin' for a soul to steal\nHe was in a bind 'cause he was way behind\nHe was willing to make a deal\nWhen he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot\nAnd the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said \"Boy, let me tell you what.\"\n\"I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too\nAnd if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you\nNow you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due\nI'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you.\"\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe boy said, \"My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin\nBut I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret, 'cause I'm the best there's ever been.\"\n\n[Chorus]\nJohnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard\n'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards\nAnd if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold\nBut if you lose the devil gets your soul\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe Devil opened up his case and he said, \"I'll start this show.\"\nAnd fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow\nAnd he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss\nAnd a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:\n[Demonic violin piece]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen the Devil finished, Johnny said, \"Well, you're pretty good ol' son\nBut sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Fire on the Mountain\" Run, boys, run!\nThe Devil's in the house of the rising sun\nChicken's in the bread pan picking out dough\nGranny, does your dog bite? No, child, no\nYou might also like[Non-demonic violin piece]\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat\nAnd he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet\nJohnny said, \"Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again\nI done told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.\"\nAnd he played:\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Fire on the Mountain\" Run, boys, run!\nThe Devil's in the house of the rising sun\nChicken's in the bread pan picking out dough\nGranny, will your dog bite?

leave and let this feeling die\nThis happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone\nAnd I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on\nNo other woman's love could be as true, I'm begging you\n\nDon't throw it all away, our love, our love\nDon't throw it all away, our love\nDon't throw it all away, our love, our love\nDon't throw it all away, our love\n\nWe changed the world we made it

slow\nNight like a river beginning to flow\nI felt the beat of my mind go\nDrifting into time passages\nYears go falling in the fading light\nTime passages\nBuy me a ticket on the last train home tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nWell I'm not the kind to live in the past\nThe years run too short and the days too fast\nThe things you lean on, are the things that don't last\nWell it's just now and then, my line gets cast into these\nTime passages\nThere's something back here that you left behind\nOh, time passages\nBuy me a ticket on the last train home tonight\n[Verse 2]\nHear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn\nDon't know why you should feel\nThat there's something to learn\nIt's just a game that you play\n\n[Chorus]\nWell the picture is changing, now you're part of a crowd\nThey're laughing at something, and the music's loud\nA girl comes towards you, you once used to know\nYou reach out your hand, but you're all alone in these\nTime passages\nI know you're in there, you're just out of sight\nOh, time passages\nBuy me a ticket on the last train home tonightYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1061425",
