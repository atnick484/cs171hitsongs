It's where country, bluegrass, rockabilly, gospel, soul and rock and roll all started, and it claims more musicians per capita than any other state in the nation. Tennessee has contributed a great fortune to what American music is today, and the music falls into categories that follow the geography of the state.  The Gulf Coastal Plains in the west is where you'll hear rock, blues and soul.  The Nashville Basin in central Tennessee is where you'll hear the evolution of country music. The Cumberland Plateau, Tennessee Valley and Unaka Mountains region in the east is where you'll hear bluegrass and string band music. We'll cover all of them in this article, working from west to east.But before we get to these topics, here are some of the best tribute songs to the state itself:Johnny Cash's \"Tennessee\"Jimmy Martin's \"Tennessee\"John Hiatt's \"Tennessee Plates\"Jessica Andrews' \"James Dean In Tennessee\"Alabama's \"Dixieland Delight\"Brad Paisley's \"Southern Comfort Zone\"Steve Earle's \"Copperhead Road\"Old Crow Medicine Show's \"Wagon Wheel\"Dolly Parton's \"My Tennessee Mountain Home\"Music of the Gulf Coastal Plains -\nThe Elvis Presley Phenomenon\nElvis Presley was rock and roll\u2019s first big star, and his rise to fame marked a major change in American culture. He was a white man who sang country blues, r&b and rockabilly, all of it laced with a gospel sound. Perhaps even more than James Dean, he exuded a natural sexuality that shaped the thinking of American youth about what was cool. He was vilified by the older generation as vulgar and a bad influence on their children, but he was the beginning of a movement that changed our culture.\"Hearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail.\" -  Bob DylanBorn on 8 January 1935 in East Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley was the son of Gladys and Vernon Presley, a seamstress and a truck driver. Elvis\u2019 twin brother, Jesse Garon, was stillborn, and Elvis grew up an only child. When he was three, his father served an eight-month prison term for writing bad checks, and afterward Vernon Presley\u2019s employment was erratic, keeping the family just above homelessness.\n\nIn 1945, Presley won second prize at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Diary Show for his rendition of Red Foley\u2019s \u201cOld Shep\u201d.  In 1948 the family moved to Memphis, and while attending L.C. Humes High School there, Presley spent much of his time in the black section of town, and especially on Beale Street watching and listening to bluesmen like Furry Lewis and B.B. King.\n\nAfter high school graduation in 1953, he thought he'd become a truck driver like his father, but he couldn't let go of his love of music. He recorded several songs at the Memphis Recording Service, a sideline business Sam Phillips set up in his Sun Records studio that allowed anyone to record a 10-inch acetate for four dollars.\nThe Sun Sessions\nSam Phillips noticed Presley, and called him in the  spring of 1954 to record a song for Sun Records. Although that session didn't go well, Phillips thought he'd found something in Presley: \u201ca white man with the Negro sound and the Negro feel\". Phillips worked with Presley to develop that style and brought guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black into the studio to rehearse with him for several months.  On the 5th of July 1954, they recorded \u201cBlue Moon of Kentucky\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s All Right, Mama\". The Memphis response was huge and it became his first local hit. Presley even made an appearance at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville on September 25th.Left to right: Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and (seated) Elvis Presley, 1955.  They all recorded for Sun Records at the same time.\nBy October 1954, Presley had debuted on the Louisiana Hayride, a popular radio program. He made his television debut on the television version of Hayride in March 1955. Meanwhile, \u201cGood Rockin\u2019 Tonight\u201d became a hit in Memphis.\nColonel Tom Parker entered Presley\u2019s life in 1955, helping Presley make some tour arrangements. Presley trusted Parker because Parker managed Hank Snow, and Presley's mother had great respect for Snow.  On May 13th, his song, \u201cBaby, Let\u2019s Play House\u201d was released and climbed to No. 10 on the Country and Western charts.\nElvis Hits the Big Time\nIn September 1955, Presley had his first No. 1 country hit, a version of Junior Parker\u2019s \u201cMystery Train\u201d. By early 1956, he was becoming a national star. He and Parker went to Nashville and recorded his first songs for RCA (including \u201cI Got a Woman\u201d and \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d. In January 1956, Presley made his national television debut with six consecutive appearances on the Dorsey Brothers\u2019 Stage Show. In March, Presley signed a management agreement with Parker giving Parker 25% of Presley\u2019s gross earnings, a deal that got even sweeter for Parker over time.\n\nThings started to snowball in 1956, when Parker got Presley appearances on the Milton Berle, Steve Allen, and Ed Sullivan TV shows. By August, he began filming his first movie. Love Me Tender was a hit and that sparked a series of hit singles: \u201cBlue Suede Shoes\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Cruel\u201d (with \u201cHound Dog\u201d on the B-side) and \u201cLove Me Tender\u201d.\n\nIn March 1957, Presley purchased Graceland, a former church that had been converted into a 23-room mansion. The next month, \u201cAll Shook Up\u201d began an eight-week run at No. 1.  He continued to make movies too, and they helped sell records like \u201c(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear\u201d and \u201cJailhouse Rock\u201d.\n\nIn December 1957, Presley received his draft notice, and entered the U.S. Army in March, 1958. He took leave just a few months later to be with his mother, who died the day after he  arrived home in Memphis. Presley served the remainder of his two year obligation to the Army and was discharged in March, 1960.\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday of 1960, Priscilla Beaulie visited Presley at Graceland, and moved in soon after.  She was 14 at the time. They were married in May 1967, after Priscilla turned 21.  They had their first and only child nine months later.\"Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been an Elvis, there wouldn't have been a Beatles.\" - John LennonThe Big Comeback\nMusic was changing fast by the mid 60s, and Presley started fading from the scene because of the \"British Invasion\" and the focus on live concerts by acts like The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Who and others. Although he continued to make movies, they were received with less and less interest. Presley was becoming uncool and was in danger of becoming irrelevant.\n\nThe solution was a TV special, and it became his big come-back vehicle. It took the form of what later became the MTV Unplugged series. The idea started as a Christmas special, but people close to Presley argued against that, wanting something more engaging and personal. Director and producer Steve Binder noticed that Presley and his band members would blow-off steam during rehearsals by improvising blues and r&b throw aways. \"And that's when I really got the idea: Wouldn't it be great if I had a camera in here and they didn't know I was here?\".Presley was concerned about doing a live performance, but Binder built his confidence by doing several live audience rehearsals and using Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana. He also put Priscilla and several of Presley's friends in the audience. On 27 June 1968, Presley took the stage for his first live perfor-mance in seven years. The result was four one-hour live shows, taped at NBC's Burbank studios. Presley sat and jammed with band mates for two shows, and the second two were done two nights later as small room stand-ups. Those sessions are often referred to as \"The Burbank Sessions\".\n\nBut by the early 70s, Presley\u2019s personal life had become fodder for tabloid headlines. Priscilla left Elvis in February 1972, and on his birthday in 1973, he filed for divorce. Professionally, he reached his peak after the 1968 comeback. Although new hits were few (\"Suspicious Minds\", \"In the Ghetto\" and \"Promised Land\" are three of only a handful), he was more popular than ever and his fan worship was turning into a personality cult.  But he was plagued by self-doubt and poor management.  Starting in 1974, he repeatedly threatened to quit show business. He turned to drugs and became a virtual recluse. His abuse of prescription drugs increased during the last years of his life. Ironically, he remained devoutly spiritual, never drank alcohol, and publicly denounced drug use. He even  visited Richard Nixon at the White House to receive an honorary DEA badge.Towards the end, he gained weight, slept poorly, and his on-stage performances fell-off dramatically. Presley\u2019s last live performance was on 25 June 1977, in Indianapolis. At the time, he was preoccupied by the impending publication of one of the tell-all books that would make public his drug abuse and obsession with firearms. The book came out on August 12th and on 16 August 1977, Presley was discovered dead in the bathroom of his home by girlfriend Ginger Alden. He was just 42 at the time. His death was blamed on congestive heart failure, but later investigation revealed that drug abuse was at least part of the cause of his death.Rockabilly MusicRockabilly blends country and bluegrass with western swing, boogie-woogie and jump blues to deliver a hard-driving rhythm that's meant for dancing.  Rockabilly may have peaked in the mid 1950s, but it never really died.  There are many artists who continue the tradition today, like Imelda May, Brian Setzer and The Reverend Horton Heat.\n\nHere's a short list of some great rockabilly, arranged in chronological order from 1954 - 2014:Elvis Presley's \"Good Rockin' Tonight\"Jerry Lee Lewis' \"Whole Lotta Shakin'\"Chuck Berry's \"Little Queenie\"Eddie Cochran's \"Summertime Blues\"Wanda Jackson's \"Let's Have a Party\"The Del Lords' \"Shame on You\"Link Wray's \"Good Good Lovin'\"Willie Nile's \"She's So Cold\"John Melencamp's \"Little Pink Houses\"Keith Richards' \"I Could Have Stood You Up\"Steve Earle's \"Guitar Town\"Carl Perkins' \"Give Me Back My Job\"Imelda May's \"Johnny Got a Boom-Boom\"Devil's Daughters' \"Pass That Bottle\"Joshua Scott Jones' \"Honk if You're Tonky\"Brian Setzer's \"Let's Shake\"Memphis Blues and R&B MusicBeale Street in Memphis has lured Mississippi blues players for over a hundred years. The earliest arrivals included Gus Cannon, Furry Lewis, Tommy Johnson, Mississippi John Hurt and Memphis Minnie.  But it was W.C. Handy who made blues a noticed genre with songs like \"St. Louis Blues\" and \"Yellow Dog Blues\".\n\nAfter WW2, Memphis became a hot spot for blues and soul recording with artists like Rufus Thomas, Junior Parker, B.B. King, and Elvis Presley.  The mix of rural and urban musical traditions led to the creation of new blues styles, including the revolutionary new sounds of rhythm and blues and rock and roll. Riley King arrived from Indianola and soon became known as the \u201cBeale Street Blues Boy\u201d, a name he later shortened to B.B. King. Rufus Thomas helped King come into his own by featuring him in his shows.  Thomas and King were among the many Mississippi-born artists who recorded at Sam Phillips' Sun Records.\n\nThe Memphis music scene went through some tough times in the late 1960s and 70s; the place became a virtual ghost town.  But in 1966, Beale Street was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.  In the late 70s, the City of Memphis bought nearly every property on a three block stretch of what had been the heart of the historic Beale Street blues district. In 1977, an act of the U.S. Congress declared Beale Street as the \"Home of the Blues\".  The Beale Street Management Corporation rebuilt the entertainment district, and by the early 80s, a complete renovation was underway.  New clubs, restaurants and shops opened throughout the 80s and 90s, and by the turn of the century, Beale Street's comeback was complete.\nToday, Beale Street is bigger and better than ever.  The  blues traditions are promoted today by theCenter for Southern Folklore, the Memphis Blues Society and the Memphis-based Blues Foundation and their annual International Blues Competition and Blues Music Awards.\n\nHere are some good examples of Memphis blues and r&b:B.B. King's \"Everyday I Have the Blues\",\n\"Riding with the King\" and \"When Love Comes to Town\"Ry Cooder's \"Willie Brown Blues\"Howlin' Wolf's \"Smokestack Lightning\" and \"Killing Floor\"Bobby King & Terry Evan's \"Bald Head\" and \"Just a Little Bit\"John Lee Hooker's \"Mama, You Got a Daughter\", \"Crawlin' Kingsnake\" and \"One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\"Little Milton's \"I Can't Quit You Baby\"Frank Stokes' \"Downtown Blues\"Junior Parker's \"Mystery Train\" and \"Drivin' Wheel\"Aretha Franklin's \"Respect\" and \"Chain of Fools\"Johnny Rivers' \"Memphis, Tennessee\"John Hiatt's \"Memphis in the Meantime\"Memphis Soul Music\nSoul music originated in Memphis. The roots of both blues and soul can be traced to the slave music of the 19th century, and both started a transformation with American urbanization after WW2. Soul became a  separate genre by 1960, and was brought to mainstream radio largely by the records made at Stax Records, Hi Records and Goldwax Records.  Stax Records was the most famous of the soul studios because of artists like Booker T. and the MG\u2019s, Sam and Dave, Isaac Hayes and Otis Redding.  The soul genre declined in popularity during the disco era of the late 70s, but your can still hear its influence in other genres like motown, r&b, hip-hop, and even country.\n\nHere are some good examples of Memphis soul music:Sam & Dave's \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\"Bobby Bland's\"(If Loving You is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\"Booker T & the MG's \"Green Onions\"Otis Redding's \"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay\" and\n\"These Arms of Mine\"Rufus Thomas' \"Walkin' the Dog\"Aretha Franklin's \"I Never Loved a Man (the Way I Love You)\"James Carr's \"The Dark End of the Street\"This is page 1 of a 3 page article on the music of Tennessee.

LyricsCHAPTER TWO\n\nTHE MYSTERIES OF ALBERTINE \u2014 THE GIRLS WHOM SHE SEES REFLECTED IN THE GLASS \u2014 THE OTHER WOMAN \u2014 THE LIFT-BOY \u2014 MADAME DE CAMBREMER \u2014 THE PLEASURES OF M. NISSIM BERNARD \u2014 OUTLINE OF THE STRANGE CHARACTER OF MOREL \u2014 M. DE CHARLUS DINES WITH THE VERDURINS\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my fear lest the pleasure I found in this solitary excursion might weaken my memory of my grandmother, I sought to revive this by thinking of some great mental suffering that she had undergone; in response to my appeal that suffering tried to build itself in my heart, threw up vast pillars there; but my heart was doubtless too small for it, I had not the strength to bear so great a grief, my attention was distracted at the moment when it was approaching completion, and its arches collapsed before joining as, before they have perfected their curve, the waves of the sea totter and break\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, if only from my dreams when I was asleep, I might have learned that my grief for my grandmother\u2019s death was diminishing, for she appeared in them less crushed by the idea that I had formed of her non-existence. I saw her an invalid still, but on the road to recovery, I found her in better health. And if she made any allusion to what she had suffered, I stopped her mouth with my kisses and assured her that she was now permanently cured. I should have liked to call the sceptics to witness that death is indeed a malady from which one recovers. Only, I no longer found in my grandmother the rich spontaneity of old times. Her words were no more than a feeble, docile response, almost a mere echo of mine; she was nothing more than the reflexion of my own thoughts\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incapable as I still was of feeling any fresh physical desire, Albertine was beginning nevertheless to inspire in me a desire for happiness. Certain dreams of shared affection, always floating on the surface of our minds, ally themselves readily by a sort of affinity with the memory (provided that this has already become slightly vague) of a woman with whom we have taken our pleasure. This sentiment recalled to me aspects of Albertine\u2019s face, more gentle, less gay, quite different from those that would have been evoked by physical desire; and as it was also less pressing than that desire I would gladly have postponed its realisation until the following winter, without seeking to see Albertine again at Balbec, before her departure. But even in the midst of a grief that is still keen physical desire will revive. From my bed, where I was made to spend hours every day resting, I longed for Albertine to come and resume our former amusements. Do we not see, in the very room in which they have lost a child, its parents soon come together again to give the little angel a baby brother? I tried to distract my mind from this desire by going to the window to look at that day\u2019s sea. As in the former year, the seas, from one day to another, were rarely the same. Nor, however, did they at all resemble those of that first year, whether because we were now in spring with its storms, or because even if I had come down at the same time as before, the different, more changeable weather might have discouraged from visiting this coast certain seas, indolent, vaporous and fragile, which I had seen throughout long, scorching days, asleep upon the beach, their bluish bosoms, only, faintly stirring, with a soft palpitation, or, as was most probable, because my eyes, taught by Elstir to retain precisely those elements that before I had deliberately rejected, would now gaze for hours at what in the former year they had been incapable of seeing. The contrast that used then to strike me so forcibly between the country drives that I took with Mme. de Villeparisis and this proximity, fluid, inaccessible, mythological, of the eternal Ocean, no longer existed for me. And there were days now when, on the contrary, the sea itself seemed almost rural. On the days, few and far between, of really fine weather, the heat had traced upon the waters, as it might be across country, a dusty white track, at the end of which the pointed mast of a fishing-boat stood up like a village steeple. A tug, of which one could see only the funnel, was smoking in the distance like a factory amid the fields, while alone against the horizon a convex patch of white, sketched there doubtless by a sail but apparently a solid plastered surface, made one think of the sunlit wall of some isolated building, an hospital or a school. And the clouds and the wind, on days when these were added to the sun, completed if not the error of judgment, at any rate the illusion of the first glance, the suggestion that it aroused in the imagination. For the alternation of sharply defined patches of colour like those produced in the country by the proximity of different crops, the rough, yellow, almost muddy irregularities of the marine surface, the banks, the slopes that hid from sight a vessel upon which a crew of nimble sailors seemed to be reaping a harvest, all this upon stormy days made the ocean a thing as varied, as solid, as broken, as populous, as civilised as the earth with its carriage roads over which I used to travel, and was soon to be travelling again. And once, unable any longer to hold out against my desire, instead of going back to bed I put on my clothes and started off to Incarville, to find Albertine. I would ask her to come with me to Douville, where I would pay calls at F\u00e9terne upon Mme. de Cambremer and at la Raspeli\u00e8re upon Mme. Verdurin. Albertine would wait for me meanwhile upon the beach and we would return together after dark. I went to take the train on the local light railway, of which I had picked up, the time before, from Albertine and her friends all the nicknames current in the district, where it was known as theTwister because of its numberless windings, the Crawler because the train never seemed to move, the Transatlantic because of a horrible siren which it sounded to clear people off the line, the Decauville and the Funi, albeit there was nothing funicular about it but because it climbed the cliff, and, although not, strictly speaking, a Decauville, had a 60 centimetre gauge, the B. A. G. because it ran between Balbec and Grattevast via Angerville, the Tram and the T. S. N. because it was a branch of the Tramways of Southern Normandy. I took my seat in a compartment in which I was alone; it was a day of glorious sunshine, and stiflingly hot; I drew down the blue blind which shut off all but a single ray of sunlight. But immediately I beheld my grandmother, as she had appeared sitting in the train, on our leaving Paris for Balbec, when, in her sorrow at seeing me drink beer, she had preferred not to look, to shut her eyes and pretend to be asleep. I, who in my childhood had been unable to endure her anguish when my grandfather tasted brandy, I had inflicted this anguish upon her, not merely of seeing me accept, at the invitation of another, a drink which she regarded as bad for me, I had forced her to leave me free to swill it down to my heart\u2019s content, worse still, by my bursts of passion, my choking fits, I had forced her to help, to advise me to do so, with a supreme resignation of which I saw now in my memory the mute, despairing image, her eyes closed to shut out the sight. So vivid a memory had, like the stroke of a magic wand, restored the mood that I had been gradually outgrowing for some time past; what had I to do with Rosemond\u00e9 when my lips were wholly possessed by the desperate longing to kiss a dead woman, what had I to say to the Cambremers and Verdurins when my heart was beating so violently because at every moment there was being renewed in it the pain that my grandmother had suffered. I could not remain in the compartment. As soon as the train stopped at Maineville-la-Teinturiere, abandoning all my plans, I alighted. Maineville had of late acquired considerable importance and a reputation all its own, because a director of various casinos, a caterer in pleasure, had set up, just outside it, with a luxurious display of bad taste that could vie with that of any smart hotel, an establishment to which we shall return anon, and which was, to put it briefly, the first brothel for \u2018exclusive\u2019 people that it had occurred to anyone to build upon the coast of France. It was the only one. True, every port has its own, but intended for sailors only, and for lovers of the picturesque whom it amuses to see, next door to the primeval parish church, the bawd, hardly less ancient, venerable and moss-grown, standing outside her ill-famed door, waiting for the return of the fishing fleet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hurrying past the glittering house of \u2018pleasure,\u2019 insolently erected there despite the protests which the heads of families had addressed in vain to the mayor, I reached the cliff and followed its winding paths in the direction of Balbec. I heard, without responding to it, the appeal of the hawthorns. Neighbours, in humbler circumstances, of the blossoming apple trees, they found them very coarse, without denying the fresh complexion of the rosy-petalled daughters of those wealthy brewers of cider. They knew that, with a lesser dowry, they were more sought after, and were attractive enough by themselves in their tattered whiteness\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On my return, the hotel porter handed me a black-bordered letter in which the Marquis and the Marquise de Gonneville, the Vicomte and the Vicomtesse d\u2019Amfreville, the Comte and the Comtesse de Berneville, the Marquis and the Marquise de Graincourt, the Comte d\u2019Amenoncourt, the Comtesse de Maineville, the Comte and the Comtesse de Franquetot, the Comtesse de Chaverny n\u00e9e d\u2019Aigleville, begged to announce, and from which I understood at length why it had been sent to me when I caught sight of the names of the Marquise de Cambremer n\u00e9e du Mesnil la Guichard, the Marquis and the Marquise de Cambremer, and saw that the deceased, a cousin of the Cambremers, was named El\u00e9onore-Euphrasie-Humbertine de Cambremer, Comtesse de Criquetot. In the whole extent of this provincial family, the enumeration of which filled the closely printed lines, not a single commoner, and on the other hand not a single title that one knew, but the entire muster-roll of the nobles of the region who made their names \u2014 those of all the interesting spots in the neighbourhood \u2014 ring out their joyous endings in ville, in court, sometimes on a duller note (in tot). Garbed in the roof-tiles of their castle or in the roughcast of their parish church, their nodding heads barely reaching above the vault of the nave or banqueting hall, and then only to cap themselves with the Norman lantern or the dovecot of the pepperpot turret, they gave the impression of having sounded the rallying call to all the charming villages straggling or scattered over a radius of fifty leagues, and to have paraded them in massed formation, without one absentee, one intruder, on the compact, rectangular draught-board of the aristocratic letter edged with black\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother had gone upstairs to her room, meditating the phrase of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u201cI see nothing of the people who seek to distract me from you; the truth of the matter is that they are seeking to prevent me from thinking of you, and that annoys me.\u201d\u2014 because the chief magistrate had told her that she ought to find some distraction. To me he whispered: \u201cThat\u2019s the Princesse de Parme!\u201d My fears were dispelled when I saw that the woman whom the magistrate pointed out to me bore not the slightest resemblance to Her Royal Highness. But as she had engaged a room in which to spend the night after paying a visit to Mme. de Luxembourg, the report of her coming had the effect upon many people of making them take each newcomer for the Princesse de Parme \u2014 and upon me of making me go and shut myself up in my attic\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had no wish to remain there by myself. It was barely four o\u2019clock. I asked Fran\u00e7oise to go and find Albertine, so that she might spend the rest of the afternoon with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would be untrue, I think, to say that there were already symptoms of that painful and perpetual mistrust which Albertine was to inspire in me, not to mention the special character, emphatically Gomorrhan, which that mistrust was to assume. Certainly, even that afternoon \u2014 but this was not the first time \u2014 I grew anxious as I was kept waiting. Fran\u00e7oise, once she had started, stayed away so long that I began to despair. I had not lighted the lamp. The daylight had almost gone. The wind was making the flag over the casino flap. And, fainter still in the silence of the beach over which the tide was rising, and like a voice rendering and enhancing the troubling emptiness of this restless, unnatural hour, a little barrel organ that had stopped outside the hotel was playing Viennese waltzes. At length Fran\u00e7oise arrived, but unaccompanied. \u201cI have been as quick as I could but she wouldn\u2019t come because she didn\u2019t think she was looking smart enough. If she was five minutes painting herself and powdering herself, she was an hour by the clock. You\u2019ll be having a regular scentshop in here. She\u2019s coming, she stayed behind to tidy herself at the glass. I thought I should find her here.\u201d There was still a long time to wait before Albertine appeared. But the gaiety, the charm that she shewed on this occasion dispelled my sorrow. She informed me (in contradiction of what she had said the other day) that she would be staying for the whole season and asked me whether we could not arrange, as in the former year, to meet daily. I told her that at the moment I was too melancholy and that I would rather send for her from time to time at the last moment, as I did in Paris. \u201cIf ever you\u2019re feeling worried, or feel that you want me, do not hesitate,\u201d she told me, \u201cto send for me, I shall come immediately, and if you are not afraid of its creating a scandal in the hotel, I shall stay as long as you like.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise, in bringing her to me, had assumed the joyous air she wore whenever she had gone out of her way to please me and had been successful. But Albertine herself contributed nothing to her joy, and the very next day Fran\u00e7oise was to greet me with the profound observation: \u201cMonsieur ought not to see that young lady. I know quite well the sort she is, she\u2019ll land you in trouble.\u201d As I escorted Albertine to the door I saw in the lighted dining-room the Princesse de Parme. I merely gave her a glance, taking care not to be seen. But I must say that I found a certain grandeur in the royal politeness which had made me smile at the Guermantes\u2019. It is a fundamental rule that sovereign princes are at home wherever they are, and this rule is conventionally expressed in obsolete and useless customs such as that which requires the host to carry his hat in his hand, in his own house, to shew that he is not in his own home but in the Prince\u2019s. Now the Princesse de Parme may not have formulated this idea to herself, but she was so imbued with it that all her actions, spontaneously invented to suit the circumstances, pointed to it. When she rose from table she handed a lavish tip to Aim\u00e9, as though he had been there solely for her and she were rewarding, before leaving a country house, a footman who had been detailed to wait upon her. Nor did she stop at the tip, but with a gracious smile bestowed on him a few friendly, flattering words, with a store of which her mother had provided her. Another moment, and she would have told him that, just as the hotel was perfectly managed, so Normandy was a garden of roses and that she preferred France to any other country in the world. Another coin slipped from the Princess\u2019s fingers, for the wine waiter, for whom she had sent and to whom she made a point of expressing her satisfaction like a general after an inspection. The lift-boy had come up at that moment with a message for her; he too received a little speech, a smile and a tip, all this interspersed with encouraging and humble words intended to prove to them that she was only one of themselves. As Aim\u00e9, the wine waiter, the lift-boy and the rest felt that it would be impolite not to grin from ear to ear at a person who smiled at them, she was presently surrounded by a cluster of servants with whom she chatted kindly; such ways being unfamiliar in smart hotels, the people who passed by, not knowing who she was, thought they beheld a permanent resident at Balbec, who, because of her humble origin, or for professional reasons (she was perhaps the wife of an agent for champagne) was less different from the domestics than the really smart visitors. As for me, I thought of the palace at Parma, of the counsels, partly religious, partly political, given to this Princess, who behaved towards the lower orders as though she had been obliged to conciliate them in order to reign over them one day. All the more, as if she were already reigning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went upstairs again to my room, but I was not alone there. I could hear some one softly playing Schumann. No doubt it happens at times that people, even those whom we love best, become saturated with the melancholy or irritation that emanates from us. There is nevertheless an inanimate object which is capable of a power of exasperation to which no human being will ever attain: to wit, a piano\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine had made me take a note of the dates on which she would be going away for a few days to visit various girl friends, and had made me write down their addresses as well, in case I should want her on one of those evenings, for none of them lived very far away. This meant that when I tried to find her, going from one girl to another, she became more and more entwined in ropes of flowers. I must confess that many of her friends \u2014 I was not yet in love with her \u2014 gave me, at one watering-place or another, moments of pleasure. These obliging young comrades did not seem to me to be very many. But recently I have thought it over, their names have recurred to me. I counted that, in that one season, a dozen conferred on me their ephemeral favours. A name came back to me later, which made thirteen. I then, with almost a child\u2019s delight in cruelty, dwelt upon that number. Alas, I realised that I had forgotten the first of them all, Albertine who no longer existed and who made the fourteenth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had, to resume the thread of my narrative, written down the names and addresses of the girls with whom I should find her upon the days when she was not to be at Incarville, but privately had decided that I would devote those days rather to calling upon Mme. Verdurin. In any case, our desire for different women varies in intensity. One evening we cannot bear to let one out of our sight who, after that, for the next month or two, will never enter our mind. Then there is the law of change, for a study of which this is not the place, under which, after an over-exertion of the flesh, the woman whose image haunts our momentary senility is one to whom we would barely give more than a kiss on the brow. As for Albertine, I saw her seldom, and only upon the very infrequent evenings when I felt that I could not live without her. If this desire seized me when she was too far from Balbec for Fran\u00e7oise to be able to go and fetch her, I used to send the lift-boy to Egreville, to La Sogne, to Saint-Frichoux, asking him to finish his work a little earlier than usual. He would come into my room, but would leave the door open for, albeit he was conscientious at his \u2018job\u2019 which was pretty hard, consisting in endless cleanings from five o\u2019clock in the morning, he could never bring himself to make the effort to shut a door, and, if one were to remark to him that it was open, would turn back and, summoning up all his strength, give it a gentle push. With the democratic pride that marked him, a pride to which, in more liberal careers, the members of a profession that is at all numerous never attain, barristers, doctors and men of letters speaking simply of a \u2018brother\u2019 barrister, doctor or man of letters, he, employing, and rightly, a term that is confined to close corporations like the Academy, would say to me in speaking of a page who was in charge of the lift upon alternate days: \u201cI shall get my colleagueto take my place.\u201d This pride did not prevent him from accepting, with a view to increasing what he called his \u2018salary,\u2019 remuneration for his errands, a fact which had made Fran\u00e7oise take a dislike to him: \u201cYes, the first time you see him you would give him the sacrament without confession, but there are days when his tongue is as smooth as a prison door. It\u2019s your money he\u2019s after.\u201d This was the category in which she had so often in-cluded Eulalie, and in which, alas (when I think of all the trouble that was one day to come of it), she already placed Albertine, because she saw me often asking Mamma, on behalf of my impecunious friend, for trinkets and other little presents, which Fran\u00e7oise held to be inexcusable because Mme. Bontemps had only a general servant. A moment later the lift-boy, having removed what I should have called his livery and he called his tunic, appeared wearing a straw hat, carrying a cane, holding himself stiffly erect, for his mother had warned him never to adopt the \u2018working-class\u2019 or \u2018pageboy\u2019 style. Just as, thanks to books, all knowledge is open to a work-ing man, who ceases to be such when he has finished his work, so, thanks to a \u2018boater\u2019 hat and a pair of gloves, elegance became accessible to the lift-boy who, having ceased for the evening to take the visitors upstairs, imagined himself, like a young surgeon who has taken off his overall, or Serjeant Saint-Loup out of uniform, a typical young man about town. He was not for that matter lacking in ambition, or in talent either in manipu-lating his machine and not bringing you to a standstill between two floors. But his vocabulary was defective. I credited him with ambition because he said in speaking of the porter, under whom he served: \u201cMy porter,\u201d in the same tone in which a man who owned what the page would have called a \u2018private mansion\u2019 in Paris would have referred to his footman. As for the lift-boy\u2019s vocabulary, it is curious that anybody who heard people, fifty times a day, calling for the \u2018lift,\u2019 should never himself call it anything but a \u2018left.\u2019 There were certain things about this boy that were extremely annoying: whatever I might be saying to him he would interrupt with a phrase: \u201cI should say so!\u201d or \u201cI say!\u201d which seemed either to imply that my remark was so obvious that anybody would have thought of it, or else to take all the credit for it to himself, as though it were he that was drawing my attention to the subject. \u201cI should say so!\u201d or \u201cI say!\u201d exclaimed with the utmost emphasis, issued from his lips every other minute, over matters to which he had never given a thought, a trick which irritated me so much that I immediately began to say the opposite to shew him that he knew nothing about it. But to my second assertion, albeit it was incompatible with the first, he replied none the less stoutly: \u201cI should say so!\u201d \u201cI say!\u201d as though these words were inevitable. I found it difficult, also, to forgive him the trick of employing certain terms proper to his calling, which would therefore have sounded perfectly correct in their literal sense, in a figurative sense only, which gave them an air of feeble witticism, for instance the verb to pedal. He never used it when he had gone anywhere on his bicycle. But if, on foot, he had hurried to arrive somewhere in time, then, to indicate that he had walked fast, he would exclaim: \u201cI should say I didn\u2019t half pedal!\u201d The lift-boy was on the small side, clumsily built and by no means good looking. This did not prevent him, whenever one spoke to him of some tall, slim, handsome young man, from saying: \u201cOh, yes, I know, a fellow who is just my height.\u201d And one day when I was expecting him to bring me the answer to a message, hearing somebody come upstairs, I had in my impatience opened the door of my room and caught sight of a page as beautiful as Endymion, with incredibly perfect features, who was bringing a message to a lady whom I did not know. When the lift-boy returned, in telling him how impatiently I had waited for the answer, I mentioned to him that I had thought I heard him come upstairs but that it had turned out to be a page from the H\u00f4tel de Normandie. \u201cOh, yes, I know,\u201d he said, \u201cthey have only the one, a boy about my build. He\u2019s so like me in face, too, that we\u2019re always being mistaken; anybody would think he was my brother.\u201d Lastly, he always wanted to appear to have understood you perfectly from the first second, which meant that as soon as you asked him to do anything he would say: \u201cYes, yes, yes, yes, I understand all that,\u201d with a precision and a tone of intelligence which for some time deceived me; but other people, as we get to know them, are like a metal dipped in an acid bath, and we see them gradually lose their good qualities (and their bad qualities too, at times). Before giving him my instructions, I saw that he had left the door open; I pointed this out to him, I was afraid that people might hear us; he acceded to my request and returned, having reduced the gap. \u201cAnything to oblige. But there\u2019s nobody on this floor except us two.\u201d Immediately I heard one, then a second, then a third person go by. This annoyed me partly because of the risk of my being overheard, but more still because I could see that it did not in the least surprise him and was a perfectly normal occurrence. \u201cYes, that\u2019ll be the maid next door going for her things. Oh, that\u2019s of no importance, it\u2019s the bottler putting away his keys. No, no, it\u2019s nothing, you can say what you want, it\u2019s my colleague just going on duty.\u201d Then, as the reasons that all these people had for passing did not diminish my dislike of the thought that they might overhear me, at a formal order from me he went, not to shut the door, which was beyond the strength of this bicyclist who longed for a \u2018motor,\u2019 but to push it a little closer to. \u201cNow we shall be quite quiet.\u201d So quiet were we that an American lady burst in and withdrew with apologies for having mistaken the number of her room. \u201cYou are going to bring this young lady back with you,\u201d I told him, after first going and banging the door with all my might (which brought in another page to see whether a window had been left open). \u201cYou remember the name: Mlle. Albertine Simonet. Anyhow, it\u2019s on the envelope. You need only say to her that it\u2019s from me. She will be delighted to come,\u201d I added, to encourage him and preserve a scrap of my own self-esteem. \u201cI should say so!\u201d \u201cNot at all, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that she will be glad to come. It\u2019s a great nuisance getting here from Berneville.\u201d \u201cI understand!\u201d \u201cYou will tell her to come with you.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, yes, yes, I understand perfectly,\u201d he replied, in that sharp, precise tone which had long ceased to make a \u2018good impression\u2019 upon me because I knew that it was almost mechanical and covered with its apparent clearness plenty of uncertainty and stupidity. \u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d \u201cHaven\u2019t any too much time,\u201d said the lift-boy, who, carrying to extremes the grammatical rule that forbids the repetition of personal pronouns before coordinate verbs, omitted the pronoun altogether. \u201cCan go there all right. Leave was stopped this afternoon, because there was a dinner for twenty at luncheon. And it was my turn off duty to-day. So it\u2019s all right if I go out a bit this evening. Take my bike with me. Get there in no time.\u201d And an hour later he reappeared and said: \u201cMonsieur\u2019s had to wait, but the young lady\u2019s come with me. She\u2019s down below.\u201d \u201cOh, thanks very much; the porter won\u2019t be cross with me?\u201d \u201cMonsieur Paul? Doesn\u2019t even know where I\u2019ve been. The head of the door himself can\u2019t say a word.\u201d But once, after I had told him: \u201cYou absolutely must bring her back with you,\u201d he reported to me with a smile: \u201cYou know, I couldn\u2019t find her. She\u2019s not there. Couldn\u2019t wait any longer; was afraid of getting it like my colleague who was \u2018missed from the hotel\u201d (for the lift-boy, who used the word \u2018rejoin\u2019 of a profession which one joined for the first time, \u201cI should like to rejoin the post-office,\u201d to make up for this, or to mitigate the calamity, were his own career at stake, or to insinuate it more delicately and treacherously were the victim some one else, elided the prefix and said: \u201cI know he\u2019s been \u2018missed\u201d). It was not with any evil intent that he smiled, but from sheer timidity. He thought that he was diminishing the magnitude of his crime by making a joke of it. In the same way, if he had said to me: \u201cYou know, I couldn\u2019t find her,\u201d this did not mean that he really thought that I knew it already. On the contrary, he was all too certain that I did not know it, and, what was more, was afraid to tell me. And so he said \u2018you know\u2019 to ward off the terror which menaced him as he uttered the words that were to bring me the knowledge. We ought never to lose our tempers with people who, when we find fault with them, begin to titter. They do so not because they are laughing at us, but because they are trembling lest we should be angry. Let us shew all pity and tenderness to those who laugh. For all the world like a stroke, the lift-boy\u2019s anxiety had wrought in him not merely an apoplectic flush but an alteration in his speech which had suddenly become familiar. He wound up by telling me that Albertine was not at Egreville, that she would not be coming back there before nine o\u2019clock, and that if betimes (which meant, by chance) she came back earlier, my message would be given her, and in any case she would be with me before one o\u2019clock in the morning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Translator\u2019s note: In the French text of Sodome et Gomorrhe, Volume I ends at this point.]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not this evening, however, that my cruel mistrust began to take solid form. No, to make no mystery about it, although the incident did not occur until some weeks later, it arose out of a remark made by Cottard. Albertine and her friends had insisted that day upon dragging me to the casino at Incarville where, as luck would have it, I should not have joined them (having intended to go and see Mme. Verdurin who had invited me again and again), had I not been held up at Incarville itself by a breakdown of the tram which it would take a considerable time to repair. As I strolled up and down waiting for the men to finish working at it, I found myself all of a sudden face to face with Doctor Cottard, who had come to Incarville to see a patient. I almost hesitated to greet him as he had not answered any of my letters. But friendship does not express itself in the same way in different people. Not having been brought up to observe the same fixed rules of behaviour as well-bred people, Cottard was full of good intentions of which one knew nothing, even denying their existence, until the day when he had an opportunity of displaying them. He apologised, had indeed received my letters, had reported my whereabouts to the Verdurins who were most anxious to see me and whom he urged me to go and see. He even proposed to take me to them there and then, for he was waiting for the little local train to take him back there for dinner. As I hesitated and he had still some time before his train ( for there was bound to be still a considerable delay), I made him come with me to the little casino, one of those that had struck me as being so gloomy on the evening of my first arrival, now filled with the tumult of the girls, who, in the absence of male partners, were dancing together. Andr\u00e9e came sliding along the floor towards me; I was meaning to go off with Cottard in a moment to the Verdurins\u2019, when I definitely declined his offer, seized by an irresistible desire to stay with Albertine. The fact was, I had just heard her laugh. And her laugh at once suggested the rosy flesh, the fragrant portals between which it had just made its way, seeming also, as strong, sensual and revealing as the scent of geraniums, to carry with it some microscopic particles of their substance, irritant and secret\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the girls, a stranger to me, sat down at the piano, and Andr\u00e9e invited Albertine to waltz with her. Happy in the thought that I was going to remain in this little casino with these girls, I remarked to Cottard how well they danced together. But he, taking the professional point of view of a doctor and with an ill-breeding which overlooked the fact that they were my friends, although he must have seen me shaking hands with them, replied: \u201cYes, but parents are very rash to allow their daughters to form such habits. I should certainly never let mine come here. Are they nice-looking, though? I can\u2019t see their faces. There now, look,\u201d he went on, pointing to Albertine and Andr\u00e9e who were waltzing slowly, tightly clasped together, \u201cI have left my glasses behind and I don\u2019t see very well, but they are certainly keenly roused. It is not sufficiently known that women derive most excitement from their breasts. And theirs, as you see, are completely touching.\u201d And indeed the contact had been unbroken between the breasts of Andr\u00e9e and of Albertine. I do not know whether they heard or guessed Cottard\u2019s observation, but they gently broke the contact while continuing to waltz. At that moment Andr\u00e9e said something to Albertine, who laughed, the same deep and penetrating laugh that I had heard before. But all that it wafted to me this time was a feeling of pain; Albertine appeared to be revealing by it, to be making Andr\u00e9e share some exquisite, secret thrill. It rang out like the first or the last strains of a ball to which one has not been invited. I left the place with Cottard, distracted by his conversation, thinking only at odd moments of the scene I had just witnessed. This does not mean that Cottard\u2019s conversation was interesting. It had indeed, at that moment, become bitter, for we had just seen Doctor du Boulbon go past without noticing us. He had come down to spend some time on the other side of Balbec bay, where he was greatly in demand. Now, albeit Cottard was in the habit of declaring that he did no professional work during the holidays, he had hoped to build up a select practice along the coast, a hope which du Boulbon\u2019s presence there doomed to disappointment. Certainly, the Balbec doctor could not stand in Cottard\u2019s way. He was merely a thoroughly conscientious doctor who knew everything, and to whom you could not mention the slightest irritation of the skin without his immediately prescribing, in a complicated formula, the ointment, lotion or liniment that would put you right. As Marie Gineste used to say, in her charming speech, he knew how to \u2018charm\u2019 cuts and sores. But he was in no way eminent. He had indeed caused Cottard some slight annoyance. The latter, now that he was anxious to exchange his Chair for that of Therapeutics, had begun to specialise in toxic actions. These, a perilous innovation in medicine, give an excuse for changing the labels in the chemists\u2019 shops, where every preparation is declared to be in no way toxic, unlike its substitutes, and indeed to be disintoxicant. It is the fashionable cry; at the most there may survive below in illegible lettering, like the faint trace of an older fashion, the assurance that the preparation has been carefully disinfected. Toxic actions serve also to reassure the patient, who learns with joy that his paralysis is merely a toxic disturbance. Now, a Grand Duke who had come for a few days to Balbec and whose eye was extremely swollen had sent for Cottard who, in return for a wad of hundred-franc notes (the Professor refused to see anyone for less), had put down the inflammation to a toxic condition and prescribed a disintoxicant treatment. As the swelling did not go down, the Grand Duke fell back upon the general practitioner of Balbec, who in five minutes had removed a speck of dust. The following day, the swelling had gone. A celebrated specialist in nervous diseases was, however, a more dangerous rival. He was a rubicund, jovial person, since, for one thing, the constant society of nervous wrecks did not prevent him from enjoying excellent health, but also so as to reassure his patients by the hearty merriment of his \u2018Good morning\u2019 and \u2018Good-bye,\u2019 while quite ready to lend the strength of his muscular arms to fastening them in strait-waistcoats later on. Nevertheless, whenever you spoke to him at a party, whether of politics or of literature, he would listen to you with a kindly attention, as though he were saying: \u201cWhat is it all about?\u201d without at once giving an opinion, as though it were a matter for consultation. But anyhow he, whatever his talent might be, was a specialist. And so the whole of Cottard\u2019s rage was heaped upon du Boulbon. But I soon bade good-bye to the Verdurins\u2019 professional friend, and returned to Balbec, after promising him that I would pay them a visit before long\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mischief that his remarks about Albertine and Andr\u00e9e had done me was extreme, but its worst effects were not immediately felt by me, as happens with those forms of poisoning which begin to act only after a certain time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine, on the night after the lift-boy had gone in search of her, did not appear, notwithstanding his assurances. Certainly, personal charm is a less frequent cause of love than a speech such as: \u201cNo, this evening I shall not be free.\u201d We barely notice this speech if we are with friends; we are gay all the evening, a certain image never enters our mind; during those hours it remains dipped in the necessary solution; when we return home we find the plate developed and perfectly clear. We become aware that life is no longer the life which we would have surrendered for a trifle the day before, because, even if we continue not to fear death, we no longer dare think of a parting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From, however, not one o\u2019clock in the morning (the limit fixed by the lift-boy), but three o\u2019clock, I no longer felt as in former times the anguish of seeing the chance of her coming diminish. The certainty that she would not now come brought me a complete, refreshing calm; this night was simply a night like all the rest during which I did not see her, such was the idea from which I started. After which, the thought that I should see her in the morning, or some other day, outlining itself upon the blank which I submissively accepted, became pleasant. Sometimes, during these nights of waiting, our anguish is due to a drug which we have taken. The sufferer, misinterpreting his own symptoms, thinks that he is anxious about the woman who fails to appear. Love is engendered in these cases, as are certain nervous maladies, by the inaccurate explanation of a state of discomfort. An explanation which it is useless to correct, at any rate so far as love is concerned, a sentiment which (whatever its cause) is invariably in error\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next day, when Albertine wrote to me that she had only just got back to Epreville, and so had not received my note in time, and was coming, if she might, to see me that evening, behind the words of her letter, as behind those that she had said to me once over the telephone, I thought I could detect the presence of pleasures, of people whom she had preferred to me. Once again, I was stirred from head to foot by the painful longing to know what she could have been doing, by the latent love which we always carry within us; I almost thought for a moment that it was going to attach me to Albertine, but it confined itself to a stationary throbbing, the last echo of which died away without the machine\u2019s having been set in motion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had failed during my first visit to Balbec \u2014 and perhaps, for that matter, Andr\u00e9e had failed equally \u2014 to understand Albertine\u2019s character. I had put it down as frivolous, but had not known whether our combined supplications might not succeed in keeping her with us and making her forego a garden-party, a donkey ride, a picnic. During my second visit to Balbec, I began to suspect that this frivolity was only for show, the garden-party a mere screen, if not an invention. She shewed herself in various colours in the following incident (by which I mean the incident as seen by me, from my side of the glass which was by no means transparent, and without my having any means of determining what reality there was on the other side). Albertine was making me the most passionate protestations of affection. She looked at the time because she had to go and call upon a lady who was at home, it appeared, every afternoon at five o\u2019clock, at Infreville. Tormented by suspicion, and feeling at the same time far from well, I asked Albertine, I implored her to remain with me. It was impossible (and indeed she could wait only five minutes longer) because it would annoy the lady who was far from hospitable, highly susceptible and, said Albertine, a perfect nuisance. \u201cBut one can easily cut a call.\u201d \u201cNo, my aunt has always told me that the chief thing is politeness.\u201d \u201cBut I have so often seen you being impolite.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing, the lady would be angry with me and would say nasty things about me to my aunt. I\u2019m pretty well in her bad books already. She expects me to go and see her.\u201d \u201cBut if she\u2019s at home every day?\u201d Here Albertine, feeling that she was caught, changed her line of argument. \u201cSo she is at home every day. But to-day I\u2019ve made arrangements to meet some other girls there. It will be less boring that way.\u201d \u201cSo then, Albertine, you prefer this lady and your friends to me, since, rather than miss paying an admittedly boring call, you prefer to leave me here alone, sick and wretched?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care if it is boring. I\u2019m going for their sake. I shall bring them home in my trap. Otherwise they won\u2019t have any way of getting back.\u201d I pointed out to Albertine that there were trains from Infreville up to ten o\u2019clock at night. \u201cQuite true, but don\u2019t you see, it is possible that we may be asked to stay to dinner. She is very hospitable.\u201d \u201cVery well then, you won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI should only make my aunt angry.\u201d \u201cBesides, you can dine with her and catch the ten o\u2019clock train.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s cutting it rather fine.\u201d \u201cThen I can never go and dine in town and come back by train. But listen, Albertine. We are going to do something quite simple, I feel that^the fresh air will do me good; since you can\u2019t give up your lady, I am going to come with you to Infreville. Don\u2019t be alarmed, I shan\u2019t go as far as the Tour Elisabeth\u201d (the lady\u2019s villa), \u201cI shall see neither the lady nor your friends.\u201d Albertine started as though she had received a violent blow. For a moment, she was unable to speak. She explained that the sea bathing was not doing her any good. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to come with you?\u201d \u201cHow can you say such a thing, you know there\u2019s nothing I enjoy more than going out with you.\u201d A sudden change of tactics had occurred. \u201cSince we are going for a drive together,\u201d she said to me, \u201cwhy not go out in the other direction, we might dine together. It would be so nice. After all, that side of Balbec is much the prettier. I\u2019m getting sick of Infreville and all those little spinach-bed places.\u201d \u201cBut your aunt\u2019s friend will be annoyed if you don\u2019t go and see her.\u201d \u201cVery well, let her be.\u201d \u201cNo, it is wrong to annoy people.\u201d \u201cBut she won\u2019t even notice that I\u2019m not there, she has people every day; I can go to-morrow, the next day, next week, the week after, it\u2019s exactly the same.\u201d \u201cAnd what about your friends?\u201d \u201cOh, they\u2019ve cut me often enough. It\u2019s my turn now.\u201d \u201cBut from the side you suggest there\u2019s no train back after nine.\u201d \u201cWell, what\u2019s the matter with that? Nine will do perfectly. Besides, one need never think about getting back. We can always find a cart, a bike, if the worse comes to the worst, we have legs.\u201d \u201cWe can always find, Albertine, how you go on! Out Infreville way, where the villages run into one another, well and good. But the other way, it\u2019s a very different matter.\u201d \u201cThat way too. I promise to bring you back safe and sound.\u201d I felt that Albertine was giving up for my sake some plan arranged beforehand of which she refused to tell me, and that there was some one else who would be as unhappy as I was. Seeing that what she had intended to do was out of the question, since I insisted upon accompanying her, she gave it up altogether. She knew that the loss was not irremediable. For, like all women who have a number of irons in the fire, she had one resource that never failed: suspicion and jealousy. Of course she did not seek to arouse them, quite the contrary. But lovers are so suspicious that they instantly scent out falsehood. With the result that Albertine, being no better than anyone else, knew by experience (without for a moment imagining that she owed her experience to jealousy) that she could always be certain of meeting people again after she had failed to keep an appointment. The stranger whom she was deserting for me would be hurt, would love her all the more for that (though Albertine did not know that this was the reason), and, so as not to prolong the agony, would return to her of his own accord, as I should have done. But I had no desire either to give pain to another, or to tire myself, or to enter upon the terrible course of investigation, of multiform, unending vigilance. \u201cNo, Albertine, I do not wish to spoil your pleasure, go to your lady at Infreville, or rather to the person you really mean to see, it is all the same to me. The real reason why I am not coming with you is that you do not wish it, the outing you would be taking with me is not the one you meant to take, which is proved by your having contradicted yourself at least five times without noticing it.\u201d Poor Albertine was afraid that her contradictions, which she had not noticed, had been more serious than they were. Not knowing exactly what fibs she had told me: \u201cIt is quite on the cards that I did contradict myself. The sea air makes me lose my head altogether. I\u2019m always calling things by the wrong names.\u201d And (what proved to me that she would not, now, require many tender affirmations to make me believe her) I felt a stab in my heart as I listened to this admission of what I had but faintly imagined. \u201cVery well, that\u2019s settled, I\u2019m off,\u201d she said in a tragic tone, not without looking at the time to see whether she was making herself late for the other person, now that I had provided her with an excuse for not spending the evening with myself. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad of you. I alter all my plans to spend a nice, long evening with you, and it\u2019s you that won\u2019t have it, and you accuse me of telling lies. I\u2019ve never known you to be so cruel. The sea shall be my tomb. I will never see you any more.\u201d (My heart leaped at these words, albeit I was certain that she would come again next day, as she did.) \u201cI shall drown myself, I shall throw myself into the water.\u201d \u201cLike Sappho.\u201d \u201cThere you go, insulting me again. You suspect not only what I say but what I do.\u201d \u201cBut, my lamb, I didn\u2019t mean anything, I swear to you, you know Sappho flung herself into the sea.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, you have no faith in me.\u201d She saw that it was twenty minutes to the hour by the clock; she was afraid of missing her appointment, and choosing the shortest form of farewell (for which as it happened she apologised by coming to see me again next day, the other person presumably not being free then), she dashed from the room, crying: \u201cGood-bye for ever,\u201d in a heartbroken tone. And perhaps she was heartbroken. For knowing what she was about at that moment better than I, being at the same time more strict and more indulgent towards herself than I was towards her, she may all the same have had a fear that I might refuse to see her again after the way in which she had left me. And I believe that she was attached to me, so much so that the other person was more jealous than I was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some days later, at Balbec, while we were in the ballroom of the casino, there entered Bloch\u2019s sister and cousin, who had both turned out quite pretty, but whom I refrained from greeting on account of my girl friends, because the younger one, the cousin, was notoriously living with the actress whose acquaintance she had made during my first visit. Andr\u00e9e, at a murmured allusion to this scandal, said to me: \u201cOh! About that sort of thing I\u2019m like Albertine; there\u2019s nothing we both loathe so much as that sort of thing.\u201d As for Albertine, on sitting down to talk to me upon the sofa, she had turned her back on the disreputable pair. I had noticed, however, that, before she changed her position, at the moment when Mlle. Bloch and her cousin appeared, my friend\u2019s eyes had flashed with that sudden, close attention which now and again imparted to the face of this frivolous girl a serious, indeed a grave air, and left her pensive afterwards. But Albertine had at once turned towards myself a gaze which nevertheless remained singularly fixed and meditative. Mlle. Bloch and her cousin having finally left the room after laughing and shouting in a loud and vulgar manner, I asked Albertine whether the little fair one (the one who was so intimate with the actress) was not the girl who had won the prize the day before in the procession of flowers. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Albertine, \u201cis one of them fair? I must confess they don\u2019t interest me particularly, I have never looked at them. Is one of them fair?\u201d she asked her three girl friends with a detached air of inquiry. When applied to people whom Albertine passed every day on the front, this ignorance seemed to me too profound to be genuine. \u201cThey didn\u2019t appear to be looking at us much either,\u201d I said to Albertine, perhaps (on the assumption, which I did not however consciously form, that Albertine loved her own sex), to free her from any regret by pointing out to her that she had not attracted the attention of these girls and that, generally speaking, it is not customary even for the most vicious of women to take an interest in girls whom they do not know. \u201cThey weren\u2019t looking at us!\u201d was Albertine\u2019s astonished reply. \u201cWhy, they did nothing else the whole time.\u201d \u201cBut you can\u2019t possibly tell,\u201d I said to her, \u201cyou had your back to them.\u201d \u201cVery well, and what about that?\u201d she replied, pointing out to me, set in the wall in front of us, a large mirror which I had not noticed and upon which I now realised that my friend, while talking to me, had never ceased to fix her troubled, preoccupied eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ever since the day when Cottard had accompanied me into the little casino at Incarville, albeit I did not share the opinion that he had expressed, Albertine had seemed to me different; the sight of her made me lose my temper. I myself had changed, quite as much as she had changed in my eyes. I had ceased to bear her any good will; to her face, behind her back when there was a chance of my words being repeated to her, I spoke of her in the most insulting language. There were, however, intervals of calmer feeling. One day I learned that Albertine and Andr\u00e9e had both accepted an invitation to Elstir\u2019s. Feeling certain that this was in order that they might, on the return journey, amuse themselves like schoolgirls on holiday by imitating the manners of fast young women, and in so doing find an unmaidenly pleasure the thought of which wrung my heart, without announcing my intention, to embarrass them and to deprive Albertine of the pleasure on which she was reckoning, I paid an unexpected call at his studio. But I found only Andr\u00e9e there. Albertine had chosen another day when her aunt was to go there with her. Then I said to myself that Cottard must have been mistaken; the favourable impression that I received from Andr\u00e9e\u2019s presence there without her friend remained with me and made me feel more kindly disposed towards Albertine. But this feeling lasted no longer than the healthy moments of delicate people subject to passing maladies, who are prostrated again by the merest trifle. Albertine incited Andr\u00e9e to actions which, without going very far, were perhaps not altogether innocent; pained by this suspicion, I managed in the end to repel it. No sooner was I healed of it than it revived under another form. I had just seen Andr\u00e9e, with one of those graceful gestures that came naturally to her, lay her head coaxingly on Albertine\u2019s shoulder, kiss her on the throat, half shutting her eyes; or else they had exchanged a glance; a remark had been made by somebody who had seen them going down together to bathe: little trifles such as habitually float in the surrounding atmosphere where the majority of people absorb them all day long without injury to their health or alteration of their mood, but which have a morbid effect and breed fresh sufferings in a nature predisposed to receive them. Sometimes even without my having seen Albertine again, without anyone\u2019s having spoken to me about her, there would flash from my memory some vision of her with Gis\u00e8le in an attitude which had seemed to me innocent at the time; it was enough now to destroy the peace of mind that I had managed to recover, I had no longer any need to go and breathe dangerous germs outside, I had, as Cottard would have said, supplied my own toxin. I thought then of all that I had been told about Swann\u2019s love for Odette, of the way in which Swann had been tricked all his life. Indeed, when I come to think of it, the hypothesis that made me gradually build up the whole of Albertine\u2019s character and give a painful interpretation to every moment of a life that I could not control in its entirety, was the memory, the rooted idea of Mme. Swann\u2019s character, as it had been described to me. These accounts helped my imagination, in after years, to take the line of supposing that Albertine might, instead of being a good girl, have had the same immorality, the same faculty of deception as a reformed prostitute, and I thought of all the sufferings that would in that case have been in store for me had I ever really been her lover\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day, outside the Grand Hotel, where we were gathered on the front, I had just been addressing Albertine in the harshest, most humiliating language, and Rosemonde was saying: \u201cOh, how you have changed your mind about her; why, she used to be everything, it was she who ruled the roost, and now she isn\u2019t even fit to be thrown to the dogs.\u201d I was beginning, in order to make my attitude towards Albertine still more marked, to say all the nicest things I could think of to Andr\u00e9e, who, if she was tainted with the same vice, seemed to me to have more excuse for it since she was sickly and neurasthenic, when we saw emerging at the steady trot of its pair of horses into the street at right angles to the front, at the corner of which we were standing, Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s barouche. The chief magistrate who, at that moment, was advancing towards us, sprang back upon recognising the carriage, in order not to be seen in our company; then, when he thought that the Marquise\u2019s eye might catch his, bowed to her with an immense sweep of his hat. But the carriage, instead of continuing, as might have been expected, along the Rue de la Mer, disappeared through the gate of the hotel. It was quite ten minutes later when the lift-boy, out of breath, came to announce to me: \u201cIt\u2019s the Marquise de Camembert, she\u2019s come here to see Monsieur. I\u2019ve been up to the room, I looked in the reading-room, I couldn\u2019t find Monsieur anywhere. Luckily I thought of looking on the beach.\u201d He had barely ended this speech when, followed by her daughter-in-law and by an extremely ceremonious gentleman, the Marquise advanced towards me, coming on probably from some afternoon tea-party in the neighbourhood, and bowed down not so much by age as by the mass of costly trinkets with which she felt it more sociable and more befitting her rank to cover herself, in order to appear as \u2018well dressed\u2019 as possible to the people whom she went to visit. It was in fact that \u2018landing\u2019 of the Cambremers at the hotel which my grandmother had so greatly dreaded long ago when she wanted us not to let Legrandin know that we might perhaps be going to Balbec. Then Mamma used to laugh at these fears inspired by an event which she considered impossible. And here it was actually happening, but by different channels and without Legrandin\u2019s having had any part in it. \u201cDo you mind my staying here, if I shan\u2019t be in your way?\u201d asked Albertine (in whose eyes there lingered, brought there by the cruel things I had just been saying to her, a pair of tears which I observed without seeming to see them, but not without rejoicing inwardly at the sight), \u201cthere is something I want to say to you.\u201d A hat with feathers, itself surmounted by a sapphire pin, was perched haphazard upon Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s wig, like a badge the display of which was necessary but sufficient, its place immaterial, its elegance conventional and its stability superfluous. Notwithstanding the heat, the good lady had put on a jet cloak, like a dalmatic, over which hung an ermine stole the wearing of which seemed to depend not upon the temperature and season, but upon the nature of the ceremony. And on Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s bosom a baronial torse, fastened to a chain, dangled like a pectoral cross. The gentleman was an eminent lawyer from Paris, of noble family, who had come down to spend a few days with the Cambremers. He was one of those men whom their vast professional experience inclines to look down upon their profession, and who say, for instance: \u201cI know that I am a good pleader, so it no longer amuses me to plead,\u201d or: \u201cI\u2019m no longer interested in operating, I know that I\u2019m a good operator.\u201d Men of intelligence, artists, they see themselves in their maturity, richly endowed by success, shining with that intellect, that artistic nature which their professional brethren recognise in them and which confer upon them a kind of taste and discernment. They form a passion for the paintings not of a great artist, but of an artist who nevertheless is highly distinguished, and spend upon the purchase of his work the large sums that their career procures for them. Le Sidaner was the artist chosen by the Cambremers\u2019 friend, who incidentally was a delightful person. He talked well about books, but not about the books of the true masters, those who have mastered themselves. The only irritating habit that this amateur displayed was his constant use of certain ready made expressions, such as \u2018for the most part,\u2019 which gave an air of importance and incompleteness to the matter of which he was speaking. Madame de Cambremer had taken the opportunity, she told me, of a party which some friends of hers had been giving that afternoon in the Balbec direction to come and call upon me, as she had promised Robert de Saint-Loup. \u201cYou know he\u2019s coming down to these parts quite soon for a few days: His uncle Charlus is staying near here with his sister-in-law, the Duchesse de Luxembourg, and M. de Saint-Loup means to take the opportunity of paying his aunt a visit and going to see his old regiment, where he is very popular, highly respected. We often have visits from officers who are never tired of singing his praises. How nice it would be if you and he would give us the pleasure of coming together to F\u00e9terne.\u201d I presented Albertine and her friends. Mme. de Cambremer introduced us all to her daughter-in-law. The latter, so frigid towards the petty nobility with whom her seclusion at F\u00e9terne forced her to associate, so reserved, so afraid of compromising herself, held out her hand to me with a radiant smile, safe as she felt herself and delighted at seeing a friend of Robert de Saint-Loup, whom he, possessing a sharper social intuition than he allowed to appear, had mentioned to her as being a great friend of the Guermantes. So, unlike her mother-in-law, Mme. de Cambremer employed two vastly different forms of politeness. It was at the most the former kind, dry, insupportable, that she would have conceded me had I met her through her brother Legrandin. But for a friend of the Guermantes she had not smiles enough. The most convenient room in the hotel for entertaining visitors was the reading-room, that place once so terrible into which I now went a dozen times every day, emerging freely, my own master, like those mildly afflicted lunatics who have so long been inmates of an asylum that the superintendent trusts them with a latchkey. And so I offered to take Mme. de Cambremer there. And as this room no longer filled me with shyness and no longer held any charm for me, since the faces of things change for us like the faces of people, it was without the slightest emotion that I made this suggestion. But she declined it, preferring to remain out of doors, and we sat down in the open air, on the terrace of the hotel. I found there and rescued a volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 which Mamma had not had time to carry off in her precipitate flight, when she heard that visitors had called for me. No less than my grandmother, she dreaded these invasions of strangers, and, in her fear of being too late to escape if she let herself be seen, would fly from the room with a rapidity which always made my father and me laugh at her. Madame de Cambremer carried in her hand, with the handle of a sunshade, a number of embroidered bags, a hold-all, a gold purse from which there dangled strings of garnets, and a lace handkerchief. I could not help thinking that it would be more convenient for her to deposit them on a chair; but I felt that it would be unbecoming and useless to ask her to lay aside the ornaments of her pastoral visitation and her social priesthood. We gazed at the calm sea upon which, here and there, a few gulls floated like white petals. Because of the \u2018mean level\u2019 to which social conversation reduces us and also of our desire to attract not by means of those qualities of which we are ourselves unaware but of those which, we suppose, ought to be appreciated by the people who are with us, I began instinctively to talk to Mme. de Cambremer n\u00e9e Legrandin in the strain in which her brother might have talked. \u201cThey appear,\u201d I said, referring to the gulls, \u201cas motionless and as white as water-lilies.\u201d And indeed they did appear to be offering a lifeless object to the little waves which tossed them about, so much so that the waves, by contrast, seemed in their pursuit of them to be animated by a deliberate intention, to have acquired life. The dowager Marquise could not find words enough to do justice to the superb view of the sea that we had from Balbec, or to say how she envied it, she who from la Raspeli\u00e8re (where for that matter she was not living that year) had only such a distant glimpse of the waves. She had two remarkable habits, due at once to her exalted passion for the arts (especially for the art of music), and to her want of teeth. Whenever she talked of aesthetic subjects her salivary glands \u2014 like those of certain animals when in rut \u2014 became so overcharged that the old lady\u2019s edentulous mouth allowed to escape from the corners of her faintly moustached lips a trickle of moisture for which that was not the proper place. Immediately she drew it in again with a deep sigh, like a person recovering his breath. Secondly, if her subject were some piece of music of surpassing beauty, in her enthusiasm she would raise her arms and utter a few decisive opinions, vigorously chewed and at a pinch issuing from her nose. Now it had never occurred to me that the vulgar beach at Balbec could indeed offer a \u2018seascape,\u2019 and Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s simple words changed my ideas in that respect. On the other hand, as I told her, I had always heard people praise the matchless view from la Raspeli\u00e8re, perched on the summit of the hill, where, in a great drawing-room with two fireplaces, one whole row of windows swept the gardens, and, through the branches of the trees, the sea as far as Balbec and beyond it, and the other row the valley. \u201cHow nice of you to say so, and how well you put it: the sea through the branches. It is exquisite, one would say . . . a painted fan.\u201d And I gathered from a deep breath intended to catch the falling spittle and dry the moustaches, that the compliment was sincere. But the Marquise n\u00e9e Legrandin remained cold, to shew her contempt not for my words but for those of her mother-in-law. Besides, she not only despised the other\u2019s intellect but deplored her affability, being always afraid that people might not form a sufficiently high idea of the Cambremers. \u201cAnd how charming the name is,\u201d said I. \u201cOne would like to know the origin of all those names.\u201d \u201cThat one I can tell you,\u201d the old lady answered modestly. \u201cIt is a family place, it came from my grandmother Arrachepel, not an illustrious family, but a decent and very old country stock.\u201d \u201cWhat! Not illustrious!\u201d her daughter-in-law tartly interrupted her. \u201cA whole window in Bayeux cathedral is filled with their arms, and the principal church at Avranches has their tombs. If these old names interest you,\u201d she added, \u201cyou\u2019ve come a year too late. We managed to appoint to the living of Criquetot, in spite of all the difficulties about changing from one diocese to another, the parish priest of a place where I myself have some land, a long way from here, Combray, where the worthy cleric felt that he was becoming neurasthenic. Unfortunately, the sea air was no good to him at his age; his neurasthenia grew worse and he has returned to Combray. But he amused himself while he was our neighbour in going about looking up all the old charters, and he compiled quite an interesting little pamphlet on the place names of the district. It has given him a fresh interest, too, for it seems he is spending his last years in writing a great work upon Combray and its surroundings. I shall send you his pamphlet on the surroundings of F\u00e9terne. It is worthy of a Benedictine. You will find the most interesting things in it about our old Raspeli\u00e8re, of which my mother-in-law speaks far too modestly.\u201d \u201cIn any case, this year,\u201d replied the dowager Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cla Raspeli\u00e8re is no longer ours and does not belong to me. But I can see that you have a painter\u2019s instincts; I am sure you sketch, and I should so like to shew you F\u00e9terne, which is far finer than la Raspeli\u00e8re.\u201d For as soon as the Cambremers had let this latter residence to the Verdurins, its commanding situation had at once ceased to appear to them as it had appeared for so many years past, that is to say to offer the advantage, without parallel in the neighbourhood, of looking out over both sea and valley, and had on the other hand, suddenly and retrospectively, presented the drawback that one had always to go up or down hill to get to or from it. In short, one might have supposed that if Mme. de Cambremer had let it, it was not so much to add to her income as to spare her horses. And she proclaimed herself delighted at being able at last to have the sea always so close at hand, at F\u00e9terne, she who for so many years (forgetting the two months that she spent there) had seen it only from up above and as though in a panorama. \u201cI am discovering it at my age,\u201d she said, \u201cand how I enjoy it! It does me a world of good. I would let la Raspeli\u00e8re for nothing so as to be obliged to live at F\u00e9terne.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo return to more interesting topics,\u201d went on Legrandin\u2019s sister, who addressed the old Marquise as \u2018Mother,\u2019 but with the passage of years had come to treat her with insolence, \u201cyou mentioned water-lilies: I suppose you know Claude Monet\u2019s pictures of them. What a genius! They interest me particularly because near Combray, that place where I told you I had some land. . . . \u201d But she preferred not to talk too much about Combray. \u201cWhy! That must be the series that Elstir told us about, the greatest painter of this generation,\u201d exclaimed Albertine, who had said nothing so far. \u201cAh! I can see that this young lady loves the arts,\u201d cried Mme. de Cambremer and, drawing a long breath, recaptured a trail of spittle. \u201cYou will allow me to put Le Sidaner before him, Mademoiselle,\u201d said the lawyer, smiling with the air of an expert. And, as he had enjoyed, or seen people enjoy, years ago, certain \u2018daring\u2019 work by Elstir, he added: \u201cElstir was gifted, indeed he was one of the advance guard, but for some reason or other he never kept up, he has wasted his life.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer disagreed with the lawyer, so far as Elstir was concerned, but, greatly to the annoyance of her guest, bracketed Monet with Le Sidaner. It would be untrue to say that she was a fool; she was overflowing with a kind of intelligence that meant nothing to me. As the sun was beginning to set, the seagulls were now yellow, like the water-lilies on another canvas of that series by Monet. I said that I knew it, and (continuing to copy the diction of her brother, whom I had not yet dared to name) added that it was a pity that she had not thought of coming a day earlier, for, at the same hour, there would have been a Poussin light for her to admire. Had some Norman squireen, unknown to the Guermantes, told her that she ought to have come a day earlier, Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin would doubtless have drawn herself up with an offended air. But I might have been far more familiar still, and she would have been all smiles and sweetness; I might in the warmth of that fine afternoon devour my fill of that rich honey cake which Mme. de Cambremer so rarely was and which took the place of the dish of pastry that it had not occurred to me to offer my guests. But the name of Poussin, without altering the amenity of the society lady, called forth the protests of the connoisseur. On hearing that name, she produced six times in almost continuous succession that little smack of the tongue against the lips which serves to convey to a child who is misbehaving at once a reproach for having begun and a warning not to continue. \u201cIn heaven\u2019s name, after a painter like Monet, who is an absolute genius, don\u2019t go and mention an old hack without a vestige of talent, like Poussin. I don\u2019t mind telling you frankly that I find him the deadliest bore. I mean to say, you can\u2019t really call that sort of thing painting. Monet, Degas, Manet, yes, there are painters if you like! It is a curious thing,\u201d she went on, fixing a scrutinous and ecstatic gaze upon a vague point in space where she could see what was in her mind, \u201cit is a curious thing, I used at one time to prefer Manet. Nowadays, I still admire Manet, of course, but I believe I like Monet even more. Oh! The Cathedrals!\u201d She was as scrupulous as she was condescending in informing me of the evolution of her taste. And one felt that the phases through which that taste had evolved were not, in her eyes, any less important than the different manners of Monet himself. Not that I had any reason to feel flattered by her taking me into her confidence as to her preferences, for even in the presence of the narrowest of provincial ladies she could not remain for five minutes without feeling the need to confess them. When a noble dame of Avranches, who would have been incapable of distinguishing between Mozart and Wagner, said in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s hearing: \u201cWe saw nothing of any interest while we were in Paris, we went once to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, they were doing Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, it\u2019s dreadful stuff,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer not only boiled with rage but felt obliged to exclaim: \u201cNot at all, it\u2019s a little gem,\u201d and to \u2018argue the point.\u2019 It was perhaps a Combray habit which she had picked up from my grandmother\u2019s sisters, who called it \u2018fighting in the good cause,\u2019 and loved the dinner-parties at which they knew all through the week that they would have to defend their idols against the Philistines. Similarly, Mme. de Cambremer liked to \u2018fly into a passion\u2019 and wrangle about art, as other people do about politics. She stood up for Debussy as she would have stood up for a woman friend whose conduct had been criticised. She must however have known very well that when she said: \u201cNot at all, it\u2019s a little gem,\u201d she could not improvise in the other lady, whom she was putting in her place, the whole progressive development of artistic culture on the completion of which they would come naturally to an agreement without any need of discussion. \u201cI must ask Le Sidaner what he thinks of Poussin,\u201d the lawyer remarked to me. \u201cHe\u2019s a regular recluse, never opens his mouth, but I know how to get things out of him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnyhow,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer went on, \u201cI have a horror of sunsets, they\u2019re so romantic, so operatic. That is why I can\u2019t abide my mother-in-law\u2019s house, with its tropical plants. You will see it, it\u2019s just like a public garden at Monte-Carlo. That\u2019s why I prefer your coast, here. It is more sombre, more sincere; there\u2019s a little lane from which one doesn\u2019t see the sea. On rainy days, there\u2019s nothing but mud, it\u2019s a little world apart. It\u2019s just the same at Venice, I detest the Grand Canal and I don\u2019t know anything so touching as the little alleys. But it\u2019s all a question of one\u2019s surroundings.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d I remarked to her, feeling that the only way to rehabilitate Poussin in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s eyes was to inform her that he was once more in fashion, \u201cM. Degas assures us that he knows nothing more beautiful than the Poussins at Chantilly.\u201d \u201cIndeed? I don\u2019t know the ones at Chantilly,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer who had no wish to differ from Degas, \u201cbut I can speak about the ones in the Louvre, which are appalling.\u201d \u201cHe admires them immensely too.\u201d \u201cI must look at them again. My impressions of them are rather distant,\u201d she replied after a moment\u2019s silence, and as though the favourable opinion which she was certain, before very long, to form of Poussin would depend, not upon the information that I had just communicated to her, but upon the supplementary and, this time, final examination that she intended to make of the Poussins in the Louvre in order to be in a position to change her mind. Contenting myself with what was a first step towards retraction since, if she did not yet admire the Poussins, she was adjourning the matter for further consideration, in order not to keep her on tenterhooks any longer, I told her mother-in-law how much I had heard of the wonderful flowers at F\u00e9terne. In modest terms she spoke of the little presbytery garden that she had behind the house, into which in the mornings, by simply pushing open a door, she went in her wrapper to feed her peacocks, hunt for new-laid eggs, and gather the zinnias or roses which, on the sideboard, framing the creamed eggs or fried fish in a border of flowers, reminded her of her garden paths. \u201cIt is true, we have a great many roses,\u201d she told me, \u201cour rose garden is almost too near the house, there are days when it makes my head ache. It is nicer on the terrace at la Raspeli\u00e8re where the breeze carries the scent of the roses, but it is not so heady.\u201d I turned to her daughter-in-law. \u201cIt is just like Pell\u00e9as,\u201d I said to her, to gratify her taste for the modern, \u201cthat scent of roses wafted up to the terraces. It is so strong in the score that, as I suffer from hay-fever and rose-fever, it sets me sneezing every time I listen to that scene.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a marvellous thing Pell\u00e9as is,\u201d cried Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cI\u2019m mad about it;\u201d and, drawing closer to me with the gestures of a savage woman seeking to captivate me, using her fingers to pick out imaginary notes, she began to hum something which, I supposed, represented to her the farewells of Pell\u00e9as, and continued with a vehement persistence as though it had been important that Mme. de Cambremer should at that moment remind me of that scene or rather should prove to me that she herself remembered it. \u201cI think it is even finer than Parsifal,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause in Parsifal the most beautiful things are surrounded with a sort of halo of melodious phrases, which are bad simply because they are melodious.\u201d \u201cI know, you are a great musician, Madame,\u201d I said to the dowager. \u201cI should so much like to hear you play.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin gazed at the sea so as not to be drawn into the conversation. Being of the opinion that what her mother-in-law liked was not music at all, she regarded the talent, a sham talent according to her, though in reality of the very highest order that the other was admitted to possess as a technical accomplishment devoid of interest. It was true that Chopin\u2019s only surviving pupil declared, and with justice, that the Master\u2019s style of playing, his \u2018feeling\u2019 had been transmitted, through herself, to Mme. de Cambremer alone, but to play like Chopin was far from being a recommendation in the eyes of Legran-din\u2019s sister, who despised nobody so much as the Polish composer. \u201cOh! They are flying away,\u201d exclaimed Albertine, pointing to the gulls which, casting aside for a moment their flowery incognito, were rising in a body towards the sun. \u201cTheir giant wings from walking hinder them,\u201d quoted Mme. de Cambremer, confusing the seagull with the albatross. \u201cI do love them; I used to see them at Amsterdam,\u201d said Albertine. \u201cThey smell of the sea, they come and breathe the salt air through the paving stones even.\u201d \u201cOh! So you have been in Holland, you know the Vermeers?\u201d Mme. de Cambremer asked imperiously, in the tone in which she would have said: \u201cYou know the Guermantes?\u201d for snobbishness in changing its subject does not change its accent. Albertine replied in the negative, thinking that they were living people. But her mistake was not apparent. \u201cI should be delighted to play to you,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer said to me. \u201cBut you know I only play things that no longer appeal to your generation. I was brought up in the worship of Chopin,\u201d she said in a lowered tone, for she was afraid of her daughter-in-law, and knew that to the latter, who considered that Chopin was not music, playing him well or badly were meaningless terms. She admitted that her mother-in-law had technique, was a finished pianist. \u201cNothing will ever make me say that she is a musician,\u201d was Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin\u2019s conclusion. Because she considered herself \u2018advanced,\u2019 because (hi matters of art only) \u201cone could never move far enough to the Left,\u201d she said, she maintained not merely that music progressed, but that it progressed along one straight line, and that Debussy was in a sense a super-Wagner, slightly more advanced again than Wagner. She did not take into account the fact that if Debussy was not as independent of Wagner as she herself was to suppose in a few years\u2019 time, because we must always make use of the weapons that we have captured to free ourselves finally from the foe whom we have for the moment overpowered, he was seeking nevertheless, after the feeling of satiety that people were beginning to derive from work that was too complete, in which everything was expressed, to satisfy an opposite demand. There were theories of course, to support this reaction for the time being, like those theories which, in politics, come to the support of the laws against religious communities, of wars in the East (unnatural teaching, the Yellow Peril, etc., etc.). People said that an age of speed required rapidity in art, precisely as they might have said that the next war could not last longer than a fortnight, or that the coming of railways would kill the little places beloved of the coaches, which the motor-car, for all that, was to restore to favour. Composers were warned not to strain the attention of their audience, as though we had not at our disposal different degrees of attention, among which it rests precisely with the artist himself to arouse the highest. For the people who yawn with boredom after ten lines of a mediocre article have journeyed year after year to Bayreuth to listen to the Ring. Besides, the day was to come when, for a season, Debussy would be pronounced as trivial as Massenet, and the trills of M\u00e9lisande degraded to the level of Manon\u2019s. For theories and schools, like microbes and corpuscles, devour one another and by their warfare ensure the continuity of existence. But that time was still to come\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As on the Stock Exchange, when a rise occurs, a whole group of securities benefit by it, so a certain number of despised composers were gaining by the reaction, either because they did not deserve such scorn, or simply \u2014 which enabled one to be original when one sang their praises \u2014 because they had incurred it. And people even went the length of seeking out, in an isolated past, men of independent talent upon whose reputation the present movement did not seem calculated to have any influence, but of whom one of the new masters was understood to have spoken favourably. Often it was because a master, whoever he may be, however exclusive his school, judges in the light of his own untutored instincts, does justice to talent wherever it be found, or rather not so much to talent as to some agreeable inspiration which he has enjoyed in the past, which reminds him of a precious moment in his adolescence. Or, it may be, because certain artists of an earlier generation have in some fragment of their work realised something that resembles what the master has gradually become aware that he himself meant at one time to create. Then he sees the old master as a sort of precursor; he values in him, under a wholly different form, an effort that is momentarily, partially fraternal. There are bits of Turner in the work of Poussin, we find a phrase of Flaubert in Montesquieu. Sometimes, again, this rumoured predilection of the Master was due to an error, starting heaven knows where and circulated through the school. But in that case the name mentioned profited by the auspices under which it was introduced in the nick of time, for if there is an element of free will, some genuine taste expressed in the master\u2019s choice, the schools themselves go only by theory. Thus it is that the mind, following its habitual course which advances by digression, inclining first in one direction, then in the other, had brought back into the light of day a number of works to which the need for justice, or for a renewal of standards, or the taste of Debussy, or his caprice, or some remark that he had perhaps never made had added the works of Chopin. Commended by the judges in whom one had entire confidence, profiting by the admiration that was aroused by Pell\u00e9as, they had acquired a fresh lustre, and even the people who had not heard them again were so anxious to admire them that they did so in spite of themselves, albeit preserving the illusion of free will. But Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin spent part of the year in the country. Even in Paris, being an invalid, she was largely confined to her own room. It is true that the drawbacks of this mode of existence were noticeable chiefly in her choice of expressions which she supposed to be fashionable and which would have been more appropriate to the written language, a distinction that she did not perceive, for she derived them more from reading than from conversation. The latter is not so necessary for an exact knowledge of current opinion as of the latest expressions. Unfortunately this revival of the Nocturnes had not yet been announced by the critics. The news of it had been transmitted only by word of mouth among the \u2018younger\u2019 people. It remained unknown to Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin. I gave myself the pleasure of informing her, but by addressing my remark to her mother-in-law, as when at billiards in order to hit a ball one aims at the cushion, that Chopin, so far from being out of date, was Debussy\u2019s favourite composer. \u201cIndeed, that\u2019s quaint,\u201d said the daughter-in-law with a subtle smile as though it had been merely a deliberate paradox on the part of the composer of Pell\u00e9as. Nevertheless it was now quite certain that in future she would always listen to Chopin with respect and even pleasure. Moreover my words which had sounded the hour of deliverance for the dowager produced on her face an expression of gratitude to myself and above all of joy. Her eyes shone like the eyes of Latude in the play entitled Latude, or Thirty-five Years in Captivity, and her bosom inhaled the sea air with that dilatation which Beethoven has so well described in Fidelio, at the point where his prisoners at last breathe again \u2018this life-giving air.\u2019 As for the dowager, I thought that she was going to press her hirsute lips to my cheek. \u201cWhat, you like Chopin? He likes Chopin, he likes Chopin,\u201d she cried with a nasal trumpet-tone of passion; she might have been saying: \u201cWhat, you know Mme. de Franquetot too?\u201d with this difference, that my relations with Mme. de Franquetot would have left her completely indifferent, whereas my knowledge of Chopin plunged her in a sort of artistic delirium. Her salivary super-secretion no longer sufficed. Not having attempted even to understand the part played by Debussy in the rediscovery of Chopin, she felt only that my judgment of him was favourable. Her musical enthusiasm overpowered her. \u201cElodie! Elodie! He likes Chopin!\u201d her bosom rose and she beat the air with her arms. \u201cAh! I knew at once that you were a musician,\u201d she cried. \u201cI can quite understand an artist such as you are liking him. He\u2019s so lovely!\u201d And her voice was as pebbly as if, to express her ardour for Chopin, she had copied Demosthenes and filled her mouth with all the shingle on the beach. Then came the turn of the tide, reaching as far as her veil which she had not time to lift out of harm\u2019s way and which was flooded; and lastly the Marquise wiped away with her embroidered handkerchief the tidemark of foam in which the memory of Chopin had steeped her moustaches\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood heavens,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin remarked to me, \u201cI\u2019m afraid my mother-in-law\u2019s cutting it rather fine, she\u2019s forgotten that we\u2019ve got my Uncle de Ch\u2019nouville dining. Besides, Cancan doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting.\u201d The word \u2018Cancan\u2019 was beyond me, and I supposed that she might perhaps be referring to a dog. But as for the Ch\u2019nouville relatives, the explanation was as follows. With the lapse of time the young Marquise had outgrown the pleasure that she had once found in pronouncing their name in this manner. And yet it was the prospect of enjoying that pleasure that had decided her choice of a husband. In other social circles, when one referred to the Chenouville family, the custom was (whenever, that is to say, the particle was preceded by a word ending in a vowel sound, for otherwise you were obliged to lay stress upon the de, the tongue refusing to utter Madam\u2019 d\u2019Ch\u2019nonceaux) that it was the mute e of the particle that was sacrificed. One said: \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Chenouville.\u201d The Cambremer tradition was different, but no less imperious. It was the mute e of Chenouville that was suppressed. Whether the name was preceded by mon cousin or by ma cousine, it was always de Chenouvilleand never de Chenouville. (Of the father of these Chenouvilles, one said \u2018our Uncle\u2019 for they were not sufficiently \u2018smart set\u2019 at F\u00e9terne to pronounce the word \u2018Unk\u2019 like the Guermantes, whose deliberate jargon, suppressing consonants and naturalising foreign words, was as difficult to understand as Old French or a modern dialect.) Every newcomer into the family circle at once received, in the matter of the Ch\u2019nouvilles, a lesson which Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin had not required. When, paying a call one day, she had heard a girl say: \u201cMy Aunt d\u2019Uzai,\u201d \u201cMy Unk de Rouan,\u201d she had not at first recognised the illustrious names which she was in the habit of pronouncing: Uz\u00e8s, and Rol\u00eean, she had felt the astonishment, embarrassment and shame of a person who sees before him on the table a recently invented implement of which he does not know the proper use and with which he dares not begin to eat. But during that night and the next day she had rapturously repeated: \u201cMy Aunt Uzai,\u201d with that suppression of the final s, a suppression that had stupefied her the day before, but which it now seemed to her so vulgar not to know that, one of her friends having spoken to her of a bust of the Duchesse d\u2019Uz\u00e8s, Mlle. Legrandin had answered her crossly, and in an arrogant tone: \u201cYou might at least pronounce her name properly: Mme. d\u2019Uzai.\u201d From that moment she had realised that, by virtue of the transmutation of solid bodies into more and more subtle elements, the considerable and so honourably acquired fortune that she had inherited from her father, the finished education that she had received, her regular attendance at the Sorbonne, whether at Caro\u2019s lectures or at Brunetiere\u2019s, and at the Lamoureux concerts, all this was to be rendered volatile, to find its utmost sublimation in the pleasure of being able one day to say: \u201cMy Aunt d\u2019Uzai.\u201d This did not exclude the thought that she would continue to associate, in the earlier days, at least, of her married life, not indeed with certain women friends whom she liked and had resigned herself to sacrificing, but with certain others whom she did not like and to whom she looked forward to being able to say (since that, after all, was why she was marrying): \u201cI must introduce you to my Aunt d\u2019Uzai,\u201d and, when she saw that such an alliance was beyond her reach, \u201cI must introduce you to my Aunt de Ch\u2019nouville,\u201d and \u201cI shall ask you to dine to meet the Uzai.\u201d Her marriage to M. de Cambremer had procured for Mlle. Legrandin the opportunity to use the former of these phrases but not the latter, the circle in which her parents-in-law moved not being that which she had supposed and of which she continued to dream. After saying to me of Saint-Loup (adopting for the occasion one of his expressions, for if in talking to her I used those expressions of Legrandin, she by a reverse suggestion answered me in Robert\u2019s dialect which she did not know to be borrowed from Rachel), bringing her thumb and forefinger together and half-shutting her eyes as though she were gazing at something infinitely delicate which she had succeeded in capturing: \u201cHe has a charming quality of mind,\u201d she began to extol him with such warmth that one might have supposed that she was in love with him (it had indeed been alleged that, some time back, when he was at Don-ci\u00e8res, Robert had been her lover), in reality simply that I might repeat her words to him, and ended up with: \u201cYou are a great friend of the Duchesse de Guermantes. I am an invalid, I never go anywhere, and I know that she sticks to a close circle of chosen friends, which I do think so wise of her, and so I know her very slightly, but I know she is a really remarkable woman.\u201d Aware that Mme. de Carnbremer barely knew her, and anxious to reduce myself to her level, I avoided the subject and answered the Marquise that the person whom I did know well was her brother, M. Legrandin. At the sound of his name she assumed the same evasive air as myself over the name of Mme. de Guermantes, but combined with it an expression of annoyance, for she supposed that I had said this with the object of humiliating not myself but her. Was she gnawed by despair at having been born a Legrandin? So at least her husband\u2019s sisters and sisters-in-law asserted, ladies of the provincial nobility who knew nobody and nothing, and were jealous of Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s intelligence, her education, her fortune, the physical attractions that she had possessed before her illness. \u201cShe can think of nothing else, that is what is killing her,\u201d these slanderers would say whenever they spoke of Mme. de Cambremer to no matter whom, but preferably to a plebeian, whether, were he conceited and stupid, to enhance, by this affirmation of the shamefulness of a plebeian origin, the value of the affability that they were shewing him, of, if he were shy and clever and applied the remark to himself, to give themselves the pleasure, while receiving him hospitably, of insulting him indirectly. But if these ladies thought that they were speaking the truth about their sister-in-law, they were mistaken. She suffered not at all from having been born Legrandin, for she had forgotten the fact altogether. She was annoyed at my reminding her of it, and remained silent as though she had not understood, not thinking it necessary to enlarge upon or even to confirm my statement\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOur cousins are not the chief reason for our cutting short our visit,\u201d said the dowager Mme. de Cambremer, who was probably more satiated than her daughter-in-law with the pleasure to be derived from saying \u2018Ch\u2019nouville.\u2019 \u201cBut, so as not to bother you with too many people, Monsieur,\u201d she went on, indicating the lawyer, \u201cwas afraid to bring his wife and son to the hotel. They are waiting for us on the beach, and they will be growing impatient.\u201d I asked for an exact description of them and hastened in search of them. The wife had a round face like certain flowers of the ranunculus family, and a large vegetable growth at the corner of her eye. And as the generations of mankind preserve their characteristic like a family of plants, just as on the blemished face of his mother, an identical mole, which might have helped one in classifying a variety of the species, protruded below the eye of the son. The lawyer was touched by my civility to his wife and son. He shewed an interest in the subject of my stay at Balbec. \u201cYou must find yourself rather out of your element, for the people here are for the most part foreigners.\u201d And he kept his eye on me as he spoke, for, not caring for foreigners, albeit he had many foreign clients, he wished to make sure that I was not hostile to his xenophobia, in which case he would have beaten a retreat saying: \u201cOf course, Mme. X\u2014\u2014-may be a charming woman. It\u2019s a question of principle.\u201d As at that time I had no definite opinion about foreigners, I shewed no sign of disapproval; he felt himself to be on safe ground. He went so far as to invite me to come one day, in Paris, to see his collection of Le Sidaner, and to bring with me the Cambremers, with whom he evidently supposed me to be on intimate terms. \u201cI shall invite you to meet Le Sidaner,\u201d he said to me, confident that from that moment I would live only in expectation of that happy day. \u201cYou shall see what a delightful man he is. And his pictures will enchant you. Of course, I can\u2019t compete with the great collectors, but I do believe that I am the one that possesses the greatest number of his favourite canvases. They will interest you all the more, coming from Balbec, since they are marine subjects, for the most part, at least.\u201d The wife and son, blessed with a vegetable nature, listened composedly. One felt that their house in Paris was a sort of temple of Le Sidaner. Temples of this sort are not without their use. When the god has doubts as to his own merits, he can easily stop the cracks in his opinion of himself with the irrefutable testimony of people who have devoted their lives to his work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At a signal from her daughter-in-law, Mme. de Cambremer prepared to depart, and said to me: \u201cSince you won\u2019t come and stay at F\u00e9terne, won\u2019t you at least come to luncheon, one day this week, to-morrow for instance?\u201d And in her bounty, to make the invitation irresistible, she added: \u201cYou will find the Comte de Crisenoy,\u201d whom I had never lost, for the simple reason that I did not know him. She was beginning to dazzle me with yet further temptations, but stopped short. The chief magistrate who, on returning to the hotel, had been told that she was on the premises had crept about searching for her everywhere, then waited his opportunity, and pretending to have caught sight of her by chance, came up now to greet her. I gathered that Mme. de Cambremer did not mean to extend to him the invitation to luncheon that she had just addressed to me. And yet he had known her far longer than I, having for years past been one of the regular guests at the afternoon parties at F\u00e9terne whom I used so to envy during my former visit to Balbec. But old acquaintance is not the only thing that counts in society. And hostesses are more inclined to reserve their luncheons for new acquaintances who still whet their curiosity, especially when they arrive preceded by a glowing and irresistible recommendation like Saint-Loup\u2019s of me. Mme. de Cambremer decided that the chief magistrate could not have heard what she was saying to me, but, to calm her guilty conscience, began addressing him in the kindest tone. In the sunlight that flooded, on the horizon, the golden coastline, invisible as a rule, of Rivebelle, we could just make out, barely distinguishable from the luminous azure, rising from the water, rosy, silvery, faint, the little bells that were sounding the ang\u00e9lus round about F\u00e9terne. \u201cThat is ratherPell\u00e9as, too,\u201d I suggested to Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin. \u201cYou know the scene I mean.\u201d \u201cOf course I do!\u201d was what she said; but \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea\u201d was the message proclaimed by her voice and features which did not mould themselves to the shape of any recollection and by a smile that floated without support in the air. The dowager could not get over her astonishment that the sound of the bells should carry so far, and rose, reminded of the time. \u201cBut, as a rule,\u201d I said, \u201cwe never see that part of the coast from Balbec, nor hear it either. The weather must have changed and enlarged the horizon in more ways than one. Unless, that is to say, the bells have come to look for you, since I see that they are making you leave; to you they are a dinner bell.\u201d The chief magistrate, little interested in the bells, glanced furtively along the front, on which he was sorry to see so few people that evening. \u201cYou are a true poet,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer to me. \u201cOne feels you are so responsive, so artistic, come, I will play you Chopin,\u201d she went on, raising her arms with an air of ecstasy and pronouncing the words in a raucous voice like the shifting of shingle on the beach. Then came the deglutition of spittle, and the old lady instinctively wiped the stubble of her moustaches with her handkerchief. The chief magistrate did me, unconsciously, a great service by offering the Marquise his arm to escort her to her carriage, a certain blend of vulgarity, boldness and love of ostentation prompting him to actions which other people would have hesitated to risk, and which are by no means unsuccessful in society. He was, moreover, and had been for years past far more in the habit of these actions than myself. While blessing him for what he did I did not venture to copy him, and walked by the side of Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin who insisted upon seeing the book that I had in my hand. The name of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 drew a grimace from her; and using a word which she had seen in certain newspapers, but which, used in speech and given a feminine form, and applied to a seventeenth century writer, had an odd effect, she asked me: \u201cDo you think her really masterly?\u201d The Marquise gave her footman the address of a pastry-cook where she had to call before taking the road, rosy with the evening haze, through which loomed one beyond another the dusky walls of cliff. She asked her old coachman whether one of the horses which was apt to catch cold had been kept warm enough, whether the other\u2019s shoe were not hurting him. \u201cI shall write to you and make a definite engagement,\u201d she murmured to me. \u201cI heard you talking about literature to my daughter-in-law, she\u2019s a darling,\u201d she went on, not that she really thought so, but she had acquired the habit \u2014 and kept it up in her kindness of heart \u2014 of saying so, in order that her son might not appear to have married for money. \u201cBesides,\u201d she added with a final enthusiastic gnashing of her teeth, \u201cshe\u2019s so harttissttick!\u201d With this she stepped into her carriage, nodding her head, holding the crook of her sunshade aloft like a crozier, and set off through the streets of Balbec, overloaded with the ornaments of her priesthood, like an old Bishop on a confirmation tour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe has asked you to luncheon,\u201d the chief magistrate said to me sternly when the carriage had passed out of sight and I came indoors with the girls. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the best of terms just now. She feels that I neglect her. Gad, I\u2019m easy enough to get on with. If anybody needs me, I\u2019m always there to say: Adsum! But they tried to force my hand. That, now,\u201d he went on with an air of subtlety, holding up his finger as though making and arguing a distinction, \u201cthat is a thing I do not allow. It is a threat to the liberty of my holidays. I was obliged to say: Stopl You seem to be in her good books. When you reach my age you will see that society is a very trumpery thing, and you will be sorry you attached so much importance to these trifles. Well, I am going to take a turn before dinner. Good-bye, children,\u201d he shouted back at us, as though he were already fifty yards away\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had said good-bye to Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le, they saw with astonishment that Albertine was staying behind instead of accompanying them. \u201cWhy, Albertine, what are you doing, don\u2019t you know what time it is?\u201d \u201cGo home,\u201d she replied in a tone of authority. \u201cI want to talk to him,\u201d she added, indicating myself with a submissive air. Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le stared at me, filled with a new and strange respect. I enjoyed the feeling that, for a moment at least, in the eyes even of Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le, I was to Albertine something more important than the time, than her friends, and might indeed share solemn secrets with her into which it was impossible for them to be admitted. \u201cShan\u2019t we see you again this evening?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, it will depend on this person. Anyhow, to-morrow.\u201d \u201cLet us go up to my room,\u201d I said to her, when her friends had gone. We took the lift; she remained silent in the boy\u2019s presence. The habit of being obliged to resort to personal observation and deduction in order to find out the business of their masters, those strange beings who converse among themselves and do not speak to them, develops in \u2018employees\u2019 (as the lift-boy styled servants), a stronger power of divination than the \u2018employer\u2019 possesses. Our organs become atrophied or grow stronger or more subtle, accordingly as our need of them increases or diminishes. Since railways came into existence, the necessity of not missing the train has taught us to take account of minutes whereas among the ancient Romans, who not only had a more cursory science of astronomy but led less hurried lives, the notion not of minutes but even of fixed hours barely existed. And so the lift-boy had gathered and meant to inform his comrades that Albertine and I were preoccupied. But he talked to us without ceasing because he had no tact. And yet I could see upon his face, in place of the customary expression of friendliness and joy at taking me up in his lift, an air of extraordinary depression and uneasiness. As I knew nothing of the cause of this, in an attempt to distract his thoughts, and albeit I was more preoccupied than Albertine, I told him that the lady who had just left was called the Marquise de Cambremer and not de Camembert. On the landing at which we were pausing at the moment, I saw, carrying a pair of pails, a hideous chambermaid who greeted me with respect, hoping for a tip when I left. I should have liked to know if she were the one whom I had so ardently desired on the evening of my first arrival at Balbec, but I could never arrive at any certainty. The lift-boy swore to me with the sincerity of most false witnesses, but without shedding his expression of despair, that it was indeed by the name of Camembert that the Marquise had told him to announce her. And as a matter of fact it was quite natural that he should have heard her say a name which he already knew. Besides, having those very vague ideas of nobility, and of the names of which titles are composed, which are shared by many people who are not lift-boys, the name Camembert had seemed to him all the more probable inasmuch as, that cheese being universally known, it was not in the least surprising that people should have acquired a marquisate from so glorious a distinction, unless it were the marquisate that had bestowed its renown upon the cheese. Nevertheless as he saw that I refused to admit that I might be mistaken, and as he knew that masters like to see their most futile whims obeyed and their most obvious lies accepted, he promised me like a good servant that in future he would say Cambremer. It is true that none of the shopkeepers in the town, none of the peasants in the district, where the name and persons of the Cambremers were perfectly familiar, could ever have made the lift-boy\u2019s mistake. But the staff of the \u2018Grand Hotel of Balbec\u2019 were none of them natives. They came direct, with the furniture and stock, from Biarritz, Nice and Monte-Carlo, one division having been transferred to Deauville, another to Dinard and the third reserved for Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the lift-boy\u2019s pained anxiety continued to grow. That he should thus forget to shew his devotion to me by the customary smiles, some misfortune must have befallen him. Perhaps he had been \u2018\u2018missed.\u2019 I made up my mind in that case to try to secure his reinstatement, the manager having promised to ratify all my wishes with regard to his staff. \u201cYou can always do just what you like, I rectify everything in advance.\u201d Suddenly, as I stepped out of the lift, I guessed the meaning of the boy\u2019s distress, his panic-stricken air. Because Albertine was with me, I had not given him the five francs which I was in the habit of slipping into his hand when I went up. And the idiot, instead of understanding that I did not wish to make a display of generosity in front of a third person, had begun to tremble, supposing that it was all finished, that I would never give him anything again. He imagined that I was \u2018on the rocks\u2019 (as the Duc de Guermantes would have said), and the supposition inspired him with no pity for myself but with a terrible selfish disappointment. I told myself that I was less unreasonable than my mother thought when I dared not, one day, refrain from giving the extravagant but feverishly awaited sum that I had given the day before. But at the same time the meaning that I had until then, and without a shadow of doubt, ascribed to his habitual expression of joy, in which I had no hesitation in seeing a sign of devotion, seemed to me to have become less certain. Seeing the lift-boy ready, in his despair, to fling himself down from the fifth floor of the hotel, I asked myself whether, if our respective social stations were to be altered, in consequence let us say of a revolution, instead of politely working his lift for me, the boy, grown independent, would not have flung me down the well, and whether there was not, in certain of the lower orders, more duplicity than in society, where, no doubt, people reserve their offensive remarks until we are out of earshot, but where their attitude towards us would not be insulting if we were reduced to poverty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One cannot however say that, in the Balbec hotel, the lift-boy was the most commercially minded. From this point of view the staff might be divided into two categories; on the one hand, those who drew distinctions between the visitors, and were more grateful for the modest tip of an old nobleman (who, moreover, was in a position to relieve them from 28 days of military service by saying a word for them to General de Beautreillis) than for the thoughtless liberalities of a cad who by his very profusion revealed a want of practice which only to his face did they call generosity. On the other hand, those to whom nobility, intellect, fame, position, manners were nonexistent, concealed under a cash valuation. For these there was but a single standard, the money one has, or rather the money one bestows. Possibly Aim\u00e9 himself, albeit pretending, in view of the great number of hotels in which he had served, to a great knowledge of the world, belonged to this latter category. At the most he would give a social turn, shewing that he knew who was who, to this sort of appreciation, as when he said of the Princesse de Luxembourg: \u201cThere\u2019s a pile of money among that lot?\u201d (the question mark at the end being to ascertain the facts or to check such information as he had already ascertained, before supplying a client with a \u2018chef for Paris, or promising him a table on the left, by the door, with a view of the sea, at Balbec). In spite of this, and albeit not free from sordid considerations, he would not have displayed them with the fatuous despair of the lift-boy. And yet, the latter\u2019s artlessness helped perhaps to simplify things. It is the convenience of a big hotel, of a house such as Rachel used at one time to frequent, that, without any intermediary, the face, frozen stiff until that moment, of a servant or a woman, at the sight of a hundred-franc note, still more of one of a thousand, even although it is being given to some one else, will melt in smiles and offers of service. Whereas in the dealings, in the relations between lover and mistress, there are too many things interposed between money and docility. So many things that the very people upon whose faces money finally evokes a smile are often incapable of following the internal process that links them together, believe themselves to be, and indeed are more refined. Besides, it rids polite conversation of such speeches as: \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing left for me to do, you will find me to-morrow in the mortuary.\u201d And so one meets in polite society few novelists, or poets, few of all those sublime creatures who speak of the things that are not to be mentioned\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as we were alone and had moved along the corridor, Albertine began: \u201cWhat is it, you have got against me?\u201d Had my harsh treatment of her been painful to myself? Had it been merely an unconscious ruse on my part, with the object of bringing my mistress to that attitude of fear and supplication which would enable me to interrogate her, and perhaps to find out which of the alternative hypotheses that I had long since formed about her was correct? However that may be, when I heard her question, I suddenly felt the joy of one who attains to a long desired goal. Before answering her, I escorted her to the door of my room. Opening it, I scattered the roseate light that was flooding the room and turning the white muslin of the curtains drawn for the night to golden damask. I went across to the window; the gulls had settled again upon the waves; but this time they were pink. I drew Albertine\u2019s attention to them. \u201cDon\u2019t change the subject,\u201d she said, \u201cbe frank with me.\u201d I lied. I declared to her that she must first listen to a confession, that of my passionate admiration, for some time past, of Andr\u00e9e, and I made her this confession with a simplicity and frankness worthy of the stage, but seldom employed in real life except for a love which people do not feel. Harking back to the fiction I had employed with Gilberte before my first visit to Balbec, but adapting its terms, I went so far (in order to make her more ready to believe me when I told her now that I was not in love with her) as to let fall the admission that at one time I had been on the point of falling in love with her, but that too long an interval had elapsed, that she could be nothing more to me now than a good friend and comrade, and that even if I wished to feel once again a more ardent sentiment for her it would be quite beyond my power. As it happened, in taking my stand thus before Albertine on these protestations of coldness towards her, I was merely \u2014 because of a particular circumstance and with a particular object in view \u2014 making more perceptible, accentuating more markedly, that dual rhythm which love adopts in all those who have too little confidence in themselves to believe that a woman can ever fall in love with them, and also that they themselves can genuinely fall in love with her. They know themselves well enough to have observed that in the presence of the most divergent types of woman they felt the same hopes, the same agonies, invented the same romances, uttered the same words, to have deduced therefore that their sentiments, their actions bear no close and necessary relation to the woman they love, but pass by her, spatter her, surround her, like the waves that break round upon the rocks, and their sense of their own instability increases still further their misgivings that this woman, by whom they would so fain be loved, is not in love with them. Why should chance have brought it about, when she is simply an accident placed so as to catch the ebullience of our desire, that we should ourselves be the object of the desire that is animating her? And so, while we feel the need to pour out before her all those sentiments, so different from the merely human sentiments that our neighbour inspires in us, those so highly specialised sentiments which are a lover\u2019s, after we have taken a step forward, in avowing to her whom we love our affection for her, our hopes, overcome at once by the fear of offending her, ashamed too that the speech we have addressed to her was not composed expressly for her, that it has served us already, will serve us again for others, that if she does not love us she cannot understand us and we have spoken in that case with the want of taste, of modesty shewn by the pedant who addresses an ignorant audience in subtle phrases which are not for them, this fear, this shame bring into play the counter-rhythm, the reflux, the need, even by first drawing back, hotly denying the affection we have already confessed, to resume the offensive, and to recapture her esteem, to dominate her; the double rhythm is perceptible in the various periods of a single love affair, in all the corresponding periods of similar love affairs, in all those people whose self-analysis outweighs their self-esteem. If it was however somewhat more vigorously accentuated than usual in this speech which I was now preparing to make to Albertine, that was simply to allow me to pass more speedily and more emphatically to the alternate rhythm which should sound my affection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As though it must be painful to Albertine to believe what I was saying to her as to the impossibility of my loving her again, after so long an interval, I justified what I called an eccentricity of my nature by examples taken from people with whom I had, by their fault or my own, allowed the time for loving them to pass, and been unable, however keenly I might have desired it, to recapture it. I thus appeared at one and the same time to be apologising to her, as for a want of courtesy, for this inability to begin loving her again, and to be seeking to make her understand the psychological reasons for that incapacity as though they had been peculiar to myself. But by explaining myself in this fashion, by dwelling upon the case of Gilberte, in regard to whom the argument had indeed been strictly true which was becoming so far from true when applied to Albertine, all that I did was to render my assertions as plausible as I pretended to believe that they were not. Feeling that Albertine appreciated what she called my \u2018frank speech\u2019 and recognising in my deductions the clarity of the evidence, I apologised for the former by telling her that I knew that the truth was always unpleasant and in this instance must seem to her incomprehensible. She, on the contrary, thanked me for my sincerity and added that so far from being puzzled she understood perfectly a state of mind so frequent and so natural\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This avowal to Albertine of an imaginary sentiment for Andr\u00e9e, and, towards herself, an indifference which, that it might appear altogether sincere and without exaggeration, I assured her incidentally, as though by a scruple of politeness, must not be taken too literally, enabled me at length, without any fear of Albertine\u2019s suspecting me of loving her, to speak to her with a tenderness which I had so long denied myself and which seemed to me exquisite. I almost caressed my confidant; as I spoke to her of her friend whom I loved, tears came to my eyes. But, coming at last to the point, I said to her that she knew what love meant, its susceptibilities, its sufferings, and that perhaps, as the old friend that she now was, she might feel it in her heart to put a stop to the bitter grief that she was causing me, not directly, since it was not herself that I loved, if I might venture to repeat that without offending her, but indirectly by wounding me in my love for Andr\u00e9e. I broke off to admire and point out to Albertine a great bird, solitary and hastening, which far out in front of us, lashing the air with the regular beat of its wings, was passing at full speed over the beach stained here and there with reflexions like little torn scraps of red paper, and crossing it from end to end without slackening its pace, without diverting its attention, without deviating from its path, like an envoy carrying far afield an urgent and vital message. \u201cHe at least goes straight to the point!\u201d said Albertine in a tone of reproach. \u201cYou say that because you don\u2019t know what it is I was going to tell you. But it is so difficult that I prefer to give it up; I am certain that I should make you angry; and then all that will have happened will be this: I shall be in no way better off with the girl I really love and I shall have lost a good friend.\u201d \u201cBut when I swear to you that I will not be angry.\u201d She had so sweet, so wistfully docile an air, as though her whole happiness depended on me, that I could barely restrain myself from kissing \u2014 with almost the same kind of pleasure that I should have taken in kissing my mother \u2014 this novel face which no longer presented the startled, blushing expression of a rebellious and perverse kitten with its little pink, tip-tilted nose, but seemed, in the fulness of its crushing sorrow, moulded in broad, flattened, drooping slabs of pure goodness. Making an abstraction of my love as of a chronic mania that had no connexion with her, putting myself in her place, I let my heart be melted before this honest girl, accustomed to being treated in a friendly and loyal fashion, whom the good comrade that she might have supposed me had been pursuing for weeks past with persecutions which had at last arrived at their culminating point. It was because I placed myself at a standpoint that was purely human, external to both of us, at which my jealous love dissolved, that I felt for Albertine that profound pity, which would have been less profound if I had not loved her. However, in that rhythmical oscillation which leads from a declaration to a quarrel (the surest, the most certainly perilous way of forming by opposite and successive movements a knot which will not be loosed and attaches us firmly to a person by the strain of the movement of withdrawal which constitutes one of the two elements of the rhythm), of what use is it to analyse farther the refluences of human pity, which, the opposite of love, though springing perhaps unconsciously from the same cause, produces in every case the same effects? When we count up afterwards the total amount of all that we have done for a woman, we often discover that the actions prompted by the desire to shew that we love her, to make her love us, to win her favours, bulk little if any greater than those due to the human need to repair the wrongs that we have done to the creature whom we love, from a mere sense of moral duty, as though we were not in love with her. \u201cBut tell me, what on earth have I done?\u201d Albertine asked me. There was a knock at the door; it was the lift-boy; Albertine\u2019s aunt, who was passing the hotel in a carriage, had stopped on the chance of finding her there, to take her home. Albertine sent word that she could not come, that they were to begin dinner without her, that she could not say at what time she would return. \u201cBut won\u2019t your aunt be angry?\u201d \u201cWhat do you suppose? She will understand all right.\u201d And so, at this moment at least, a moment such as might never occur again \u2014 a conversation with myself was proved by this incident to be in Albertine\u2019s eyes a thing of such self-evident importance that it must be given precedence over everything, a thing to which, referring no doubt instinctively to a family code, enumerating certain crises in which, when the career of M. Bontemps was at stake, a journey had been made without a thought, my friend never doubted that her aunt would think it quite natural to see her sacrifice the dinner-hour. That remote hour which she passed without my company, among her own people, Albertine, having brought it to me, bestowed it on me; I might make what use of it I chose. I ended by making bold to tell her what had been reported to me about her way of living, and that notwithstanding the profound disgust that I felt for women tainted with that vice, I had not given it a thought until I had been told the name of her accomplice, and that she could readily understand, loving Andr\u00e9e as I did, the grief that, the news had caused me. It would have been more tactful perhaps to say that I had been given the names of other women as well, in whom I was not interested. But the sudden and terrible revelation that Cottard had made to me had entered my heart to lacerate it, complete in itself but without accretions. And just as, before that moment, it would never have occurred to me that Albertine was in love with Andr\u00e9e, or at any rate could find pleasure in caressing her, if Cottard had not drawn my attention to their attitude as they waltzed together, so I had been incapable of passing from that idea to the idea, so different for me, that Albertine might have, with other women than Andr\u00e9e, relations for which affection could not be pleaded in excuse. Albertine, before even swearing to me that it was not true, shewed, like everyone upon learning that such things are being said about him, anger, concern, and, with regard to the unknown slanderer, a fierce curiosity to know who he was and a desire to be confronted with him so as to be able to confound him. But she assured me that she bore me, at least, no resentment. \u201cIf it had been true, I should have told you. But Andr\u00e9e and I both loathe that sort of thing. We have not lived all these years without seeing women with cropped hair who behave like men and do the things you mean, and nothing revolts us more.\u201d Albertine gave me merely her word, a peremptory word unsupported by proof. But this was just what was best calculated to calm me, jealousy belonging to that family of sickly doubts which are better purged by the energy than by the probability of an affirmation. It is moreover the property of love to make us at once more distrustful and more credulous, to make us suspect, more readily than we should suspect anyone else, her whom we love, and be convinced more easily by her denials. We must be in love before we can care that all women are not virtuous, which is to say before we can be aware of the fact, and we must be in love too before we can hope, that is to say assure ourselves that some are. It is human to seek out what hurts us and then at once to seek to get rid of it. The statements that are capable of so relieving us seem quite naturally true, we are not inclined to cavil at a sedative that acts. Besides, however multiform may be the person with whom we are in love, she can in any case offer us two essential personalities accordingly as she appears to us as ours, or as turning her desires in another direction. The former of these personalities possesses the peculiar power which prevents us from believing in the reality of the other, the secret remedy to heal the sufferings that this latter has caused us. The beloved object is successively the malady and the remedy that suspends and aggravates it. No doubt, I had long since been prepared, by the strong impression made on my imagination and my faculty for emotion by the example of Swann, to believe in the truth of what I feared rather than of what I should have wished. And so the comfort brought me by Albertine\u2019s affirmations came near to being jeopardised for a moment, because I was reminded of the story of Odette. But I told myself that, if it was only right to allow for the worst, not only when, in order to understand Swann\u2019s sufferings, I had tried to put myself in his place, but now, when I myself was concerned, in seeking the truth as though it referred to some one else, still I must not, out of cruelty to myself, a soldier who chooses the post not where he can be of most use but where he is most exposed, end in the mistake of regarding one supposition as more true than the rest, simply because it was more painful. Was there not a vast gulf between Albertine, a girl of good, middle-class parentage, and Odette, a courtesan bartered by her mother in her childhood? There could be no comparison of their respective credibility. Besides, Albertine had in no respect the same interest in lying to me that Odette had had in lying to Swann. Moreover to him Odette had admitted what Albertine had just denied. I should therefore be guilty of an error in reasoning as serious \u2014 though in the opposite direction \u2014 as that which had inclined me towards a certain hypothesis because it had caused me less pain than the rest, were I not to take into account these material differences in their positions, but to reconstruct the real life of my mistress solely from what I had been told about the life of Odette. I had before me a new Albertine, of whom I had already, it was true, caught more than one glimpse towards the end of my previous visit to Balbec, frank and honest, an Albertine who had, out of affection for myself, forgiven me my suspicions and tried to dispel them. She made me sit down by her side upon my bed. I thanked her for what she had said to me, assured her that our reconciliation was complete, and that I would never be horrid to her again. I suggested to her that she ought, at the same time, to go home to dinner. She asked me whether I was not glad to have her with me. Drawing my head towards her for a caress which she had never before given me and which I owed perhaps to the healing of our rupture, she passed her tongue lightly over my lips which she attempted to force apart. At first I kept them tight shut. \u201cYou are a great bear!\u201d she informed me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I ought to have left the place that evening and never set eyes on her again. I felt even then that in a love which is not reciprocated \u2014 I might as well say, in love, for there are people for whom there is no such thing as reciprocated love \u2014 we can enjoy only that simulacrum of happiness which had been given me at one of those unique moments in which a woman\u2019s good nature, or her caprice, or mere chance, bring to our desires, in perfect coincidence, the same words, the same actions as if we were really loved. The wiser course would have been to consider with curiosity, to possess with delight that little parcel of happiness failing which I should have died without ever suspecting what it could mean to hearts less difficult to please or more highly favoured; to suppose that it formed part of a vast and enduring happiness of which this fragment only was visible to me, and \u2014 lest the next day should expose this fiction \u2014 not to attempt to ask for any fresh favour after this, which had been due only to the artifice of an exceptional moment. I ought to have left Balbec, to have shut myself up in solitude, to have remained so in harmony with the last vibrations of the voice which I had contrived to render amorous for an instant, and of which I should have asked nothing more than that it might never address another word to me; for fear lest, by an additional word which now could only be different, it might shatter with a discord the sensitive silence in which, as though by the pressure of a pedal, there might long have survived in me the throbbing chord of happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Soothed by my explanation with Albertine, I began once again to live in closer intimacy with my mother. She loved to talk to me gently about the days in which my grandmother had been younger. Fearing that I might reproach myself with the sorrows with which I had perhaps darkened the close of my grandmother\u2019s life, she preferred to turn back to the years when the first signs of my dawning intelligence had given my grandmother a satisfaction which until now had always been kept from me. We talked of the old days at Combray. My mother reminded me that there at least I used to read, and that at Balbec I might well do the same, if I was not going to work. I replied that, to surround myself with memories of Combray and of the charming coloured plates, I should like to read again the Thousand and One Nights. As, long ago at Combray, when she gave me books for my birthday, so it was in secret, as a surprise for me, that my mother now sent for both the Thousand and One Nights of Galland and the Thousand Nights and a Night of Mardrus. But, after casting her eye over the two translations, my mother would have preferred that I should stick to Galland\u2019s, albeit hesitating to influence me because of the respect that she felt for intellectual liberty, her dread of interfering with my intellectual life and the feeling that, being a woman, on the one hand she lacked, or so she thought, the necessary literary equipment, and on the other hand ought not to condemn because she herself was shocked by it the reading of a young man. Happening upon certain of the tales, she had been revolted by the immorality of the subject and the crudity of the expression. But above all, preserving, like precious relics, not only the brooch, the sunshade, the cloak, the volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, but also the habits of thought and speech of her mother, seeking on every occasion the opinion that she would have expressed, my mother could have no doubt of the horror with which my grandmother would have condemned Mardrus\u2019s book. She remembered that at Combray while before setting out for a walk, M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, I was reading Augustin Thierry, my grandmother, glad that I should be reading, and taking walks, was indignant nevertheless at seeing him whose name remained enshrined in the hemistich: \u2018Then reign\u00e8d M\u00e9rov\u00e9e\u2019 called Merowig, refused to say \u2018Carolingians\u2019 for the \u2018Carlovingians\u2019 to which she remained loyal. And then I told her what my grandmother had thought of the Greek names which Bloch, following Leconte de Lisle, gave to the gods of Homer, going so far, in the simplest matters, as to make it a religious duty, in which he supposed literary talent to consist, to adopt a Greek system of spelling. Having occasion, for instance, to mention in a letter that the wine which they drank at his home was real nectar, he would write \u2018real nektar,\u2019 with a k, which enabled him to titter at the mention of Lamartine. And if an Odyssey from which the names of Ulysses and Minerva were missing was no longer the Odyssey to her, what would she have said upon seeing corrupted even upon the cover the title of her Thousand and One Nights, upon no longer finding, exactly transcribed as she had all her life been in the habit of pronouncing them, the immortally familiar names of Scheherazade, of Dinarzade, in which, debaptised themselves (if one may use the expression of Musulman tales), the charming Caliph and the powerful Genies were barely recognisable, being renamed, he the \u2018Khalifat\u2019 and they the \u2018Gennis.\u2019 Still, my mother handed over both books to me, and I told her that I would read them on the days when I. felt too tired to go out\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These days were not very frequent, however. We used to go out picnicking as before in a band, Albertine, her friends and myself, on the cliff or to the farm called Marie-Antoinette. But there were times when Albertine bestowed on me this great pleasure. She would say to me: \u201cTo-day I want to be alone with you for a little, it will be nicer if we are just by ourselves.\u201d Then she would give out that she was busy, not that she need furnish any explanation, and so that the others, if they went all the same, without us, for an excursion and picnic, might not be able to find us, we would steal away like a pair of lovers, all by ourselves to Bagatelle or the Cross of Heulan, while the band, who would never think of looking for us there and never went there, waited indefinitely, in the hope of seeing us appear, at Marie-Antoinette. I recall the hot weather that we had then, when from the brow of each of the farm-labourers toiling in the sun a drop of sweat would fall, vertical, regular, intermittent, like the drop of water from a cistern, and alternate with the fall of the ripe fruit dropping from the tree in the adjoining \u2018closes\u2019; they have remained, to this day, with that mystery of a woman\u2019s secret, the most substantial part of every love that offers itself to me. A woman who has been mentioned to me and to whom I would not give a moment\u2019s thought \u2014 I upset all my week\u2019s engagements to make her acquaintance, if it is a week of similar weather, and I am to meet her in some isolated farmhouse. It is no good my knowing that this kind of weather, this kind of assignation are not part of her, they are still the bait, which I know all too well, by which I allow myself to be tempted and which is sufficient to hook me. I know that this woman, in cold weather, in a town, I might perhaps have desired, but without the accompaniment of a romantic sentiment, without becoming amorous; my love for her is none the less keen as soon as, by force of circumstances, it has enthralled me \u2014 it is only the more melancholy, as in the course of life our sentiments for other people become, in proportion as we become more clearly aware of the ever smaller part that they play in our life and that the new love which we would like to be so permanent, cut short in the same moment as life itself, will be the last\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were still but a few people at Balbec, hardly any girls. Sometimes I saw some girl resting upon the beach, devoid of charm, and yet apparently identified by various features as one whom I had been in despair at not being able to approach at the moment when she emerged with her friends from the riding school or gymnasium. If it was the same (and I took care not to mention the matter to Albertine), then the girl that I had thought so exciting did not exist. But I could not arrive at any certainty, for the face of any one of these girls did not fill any space upon the beach, did not offer a permanent form, contracted, dilated, transformed as it was by my own observation, the uneasiness of my desire or a sense of comfort that was self-sufficient, by the different clothes that she was wearing, the rapidity of her movements or her immobility. All the same, two or three of them seemed to me adorable. Whenever I saw one of these, I longed to take her away along the Avenue des Tamaris, or among the sandhills, better still upon the cliff. But, albeit into desire, as opposed to indifference, there enters already that audacity which is a first stage, if only unilateral, towards realisation, all the same, between my desire and the action that my request to be allowed to kiss her would have been, there was all the indefinite blank of hesitation, of timidity. Then I went into the pastrycook\u2019s bar, I drank, one after another, seven or eight glasses of port wine. At once, instead of the impassable gulf between my desire and action, the effect of the alcohol traced a line that joined them together. No longer was there any room for hesitation or fear. It seemed to me that the girl was about to fly into my arms. I went up to her, the words came spontaneously to my lips: \u201cI should like to go for a walk with you. You wouldn\u2019t care to go along the cliff, we shan\u2019t be disturbed behind the little wood that keeps the wind off the wooden bungalow that is empty just now?\u201d All the difficulties of life were smoothed away, there was no longer any obstacle to the conjunction of our two bodies. No obstacle for me, at least. For they had not been volatilised for her, who had not been drinking port wine. Had she done so, had the outer world lost some of its reality in her eyes, the long cherished dream that would then have appeared to her to be suddenly realisable might perhaps have been not at all that of falling into my arms\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only were the girls few in number but at this season which was not yet \u2018the season\u2019 they stayed but a short time. There is one I remember with a reddish skin, green eyes and a pair of ruddy cheeks, whose slight symmetrical face resembled the winged seeds of certain trees. I cannot say what breeze wafted her to Balbec or what other bore her away. So sudden was her removal that for some days afterwards I was haunted by a grief which I made bold to confess to Albertine when I realised that the girl had gone for ever\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should add that several of them were either girls whom I did not know at all or whom I had not seen for years. Often, before addressing them, I wrote to them. If their answer allowed me to believe in the possibility of love, what joy! We cannot, at the outset of our friendship with a woman, even if that friendship is destined to come to nothing, bear to part from those first letters that we have received from her. We like to have them beside us all the time, like a present of rare flowers, still quite fresh, at which we cease to gaze only to draw them closer to us and smell them. The sentence that we know by heart, it is pleasant to read again, and in those that we have committed less accurately to memory we like to verify the degree of affection in some expression. Did she write: \u2018Your dear letter\u2019? A slight marring of our bliss, which must be ascribed either to our having read too quickly, or to the illegible handwriting of our correspondent; she did not say: \u2018Your dear letter\u2019 but \u2018From your letter.\u2019 But the rest is so tender. Oh, that more such flowers may come to-morrow. Then that is no longer enough, we must with the written words compare the writer\u2019s eyes, her face. We make an appointment, and \u2014 without her having altered, perhaps \u2014 whereas we expected, from the description given us or our personal memory, to meet the fairy Viviane, we encounter Puss-in-Boots. We make an appointment, nevertheless, for the following day, for it is, after all, she, and the person we desired is she. And these desires for a woman of whom we have been dreaming do not make beauty of form and feature essential. These desires are only the desire for a certain person; vague as perfumes, as styrax was the desire of Prothyraia, saffron the ethereal desire, aromatic scents the desire of Hera, myrrh the perfume of the Magi, manna the desire of Nike, incense the perfume of the sea. But these perfumes that are sung in the Orphic hymns are far fewer in number than the deities they worship. Myrrh is the perfume of the Magi, but also of Protogonos, Neptune, Nereus, Leto; incense is the perfume of the sea, but also of the fair Dike, of Themis, of Circe, of the Nine Muses, of Eos, of Mnemosyne, of the Day, of Dikaiosyne. As for styrax, manna and aromatic scents, it would be impossible to name all the deities that inhale them, so many are they. Amphietes has all the perfumes except incense, and Gaia rejects only beans and aromatic scents. So was it with these desires for different girls that I felt. Fewer in number than the girls themselves, they changed into disappointments and regrets closely similar one to another. I never wished for myrrh. I reserved it for Jupien and for the Prince de Guermantes, for it is the desire of Protogonos \u201cof twofold sex, who roars like a bull, of countless orgies, memorable, unspeakable, descending, joyous, to the sacrifices of the Orgiophants.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But presently the season was in full swing; every day there was some fresh arrival, and for the sudden increase in the frequency of my outings, which took the place of the charmed perusal of the Thousand and One Nights, there was a reason devoid of pleasure which poisoned them all. The beach was now peopled with girls, and, since the idea suggested to me by Cottard had not indeed furnished me with fresh suspicions but had rendered me sensitive and weak in that quarter and careful not to let any suspicion take shape in my mind, as soon as a young woman arrived at Balbec, I began to feel ill at ease, I proposed to Albertine the most distant excursions, in order that she might not make the newcomer\u2019s acquaintance, and indeed, if possible, might not set eyes on her. I dreaded naturally even more those women whose dubious ways were remarked or their bad reputation already known; I tried to persuade my mistress that this bad reputation had no foundation, was a slander, perhaps, without admitting it to myself, from a fear, still unconscious, that she might seek to make friends with the depraved woman or regret her inability to do so, because of me, or might conclude from the number of examples that a vice so widespread was not to be condemned. In denying the guilt of each of them, my intention was nothing less than to pretend that sapphism did not exist. Albertine adopted my incredulity as to the viciousness of this one or that. \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s just a pose, she wants to look the part.\u201d But then, I regretted almost that I had pleaded the other\u2019s innocence, for it distressed me that Albertine, formerly so severe, could believe that this \u2018part\u2019 was a thing so flattering, so advantageous, that a woman innocent of such tastes could seek to \u2018look it.\u2019 I would have liked to be sure that no more women were coming to Balbec; I trembled when I thought that, as it was almost time for Mme. Putbus to arrive at the Verdurins\u2019, her maid, whose tastes Saint-Loup had not concealed from me, might take it into her head to come down to the beach, and, if it were a day on which I was not with Albertine, might seek to corrupt her. I went the length of asking myself whether, as Cottard had made no secret of the fact that the Verdurins thought highly of me and, while not wishing to appear, as he put it, to be running after me, would give a great deal to have me come to their house, I might not, on the strength of promises to bring all the Guermantes in existence to call on them in Paris, induce Mme. Verdurin, upon some pretext or other, to inform Mme. Putbus that it was impossible to keep her there any longer and make her leave the place at once. Notwithstanding these thoughts, and as it was chiefly the presence of Andr\u00e9e that was disturbing me, the soothing effect that Albertine\u2019s words had had upon me still to some extent persisted \u2014 I knew moreover that presently I should have less need of it, as Andr\u00e9e would be leaving the place with Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le just about the time when the crowd began to arrive and would be spending only a few weeks more with Albertine. During these weeks, moreover, Albertine seemed to have planned everything that she did, everything that she said, with a view to destroying my suspicions if any remained, or to prevent them from reviving. She contrived never to be left alone with Andr\u00e9e, and insisted, when we came back from an excursion, upon my accompanying her to her door, upon my coming to fetch her when we were going anywhere. Andr\u00e9e meanwhile took just as much trouble on her side, seemed to avoid meeting Albertine. And this apparent understanding between them was not the only indication that Albertine must have informed her friend of our conversation and have asked her to be so kind as to calm my absurd suspicions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About this time there occurred at the Grand Hotel a scandal which was not calculated to modify the intensity of my torment. Bloch\u2019s cousin had for some time past been indulging, with a retired actress, in secret relations which presently ceased to satisfy them. That they should be seen seemed to them to add perversity to their pleasure, they chose to flaunt their perilous sport before the eyes of all the world. They began with caresses, which might, after all, be set down to a friendly intimacy, in the card-room, by the baccarat-table. Then they grew more bold. And finally, one evening, in a corner that was not even dark of the big ball-room, on a sofa, they made no more attempt to conceal what they were doing than if they had been in bed. Two officers who happened to be near, with their wives, complained to the manager. It was thought for a moment that their protest would be effective. But they had this against them that, having come over for the evening from Netteholme, where they were staying, they could not be of any use to the manager. Whereas, without her knowing it even, and whatever remarks the manager may have made to her, there hovered over Mlle. Bloch the protection of M. Nissim Bernard. I must explain why. M. Nissim Bernard carried to their highest pitch the family virtues. Every year he took a magnificent villa at Balbec for his nephew, and no invitation would have dissuaded him from going home to dine at his own table, which was in reality theirs. But he never took his luncheon at home. Every day at noon he was at the Grand Hotel. The fact of the matter was that he was keeping, as other men keep a chorus-girl from the opera, an embryo waiter of much the same type as the pages of whom we have spoken, and who made us think of the young Israelites inEsther and Athalie. It is true that the forty years\u2019 difference in age between M. Nis-sim Bernard and the young waiter ought to have preserved the latter from a contact that was scarcely pleasant. But, as Racine so wisely observes in those same choruses:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Great God, with what uncertain tread\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A budding virtue \u2018mid such perils goes!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What stumbling-blocks do lie before a soul\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That seeks Thee and would fain be innocent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The young waiter might indeed have been brought up \u2018remote from the world\u2019 in the Temple-Caravanserai of Balbec, he had not followed the advice of Joad:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In riches and in gold put not thy trust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had perhaps justified himself by saying: \u201cThe wicked cover the earth.\u201d However that might be, and albeit M. Nissim Bernard had not expected so rapid a conquest, on the very first day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were\u2019t in alarm, or anxious to caress\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He felt those childish arms about him thrown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And by the second day, M. Nissim Bernard having taken the young waiter out\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dire assault his innocence destroyed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From that moment the boy\u2019s life was altered. He might indeed carry bread and salt, as his superior bade him, his whole face sang:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From flowers to flowers, from joys to keener joys\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let our desires now range\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Uncertain is our tale of fleeting years\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Haste we then to enjoy this life!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Honours and fame are the reward\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of blind and meek obedience\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For moping innocence\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who now would raise his voice!\n\nSince that day, M. Nissim Bernard had never failed to come and occupy his seat at the luncheon-table (as a man would occupy his in the stalls who was keeping a dancer, a dancer in this case of a distinct and special type, which still awaits its Degas). It was M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s delight to follow over the floor of the restaurant and down the remote vista to where beneath her palm the cashier sat enthroned, the evolutions of the adolescent hurrying in service, in the service of everyone, and, less than anyone, of M. Nissim Bernard, now that the latter was keeping him, whether because the young chorister did not think it necessary to display the same friendliness to a person by whom he supposed himself to be sufficiently well loved, or because that love annoyed him or he feared lest, if discovered, it might make him lose other opportunities. But this very coldness pleased M. Nissim Bernard, because of all that it concealed; whether from Hebraic atavism or from profanation of the Christian spirit, he took a singular pleasure, were it Jewish or Catholic, in the Racinian ceremony. Had it been a real performance of Esther or Athalie, M. Bernard would have regretted that the gulf of centuries must prevent him from making the acquaintance of the author, Jean Racine, so that he might obtain for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 a more substantial part. But as the luncheon ceremony came from no author\u2019s pen, he contented himself with being on good terms with the manager and Aim\u00e9, so that the \u2018young Israelite\u2019 might be promoted to the coveted post of under-waiter, or even full waiter to a row of tables. The post of wine waiter had been offered him. But M. Bernard made him decline it, for he would no longer have been able to come every day to watch him race about the green dining-room and to be waited upon by him like a stranger. Now this pleasure was so keen that every year M. Bernard returned to Balbec and took his luncheon away from home, habits in which M. Bloch saw, in the former a poetical fancy for the bright sunshine, the sunsets of this coast favoured above all others, in the latter the inveterate mania of an old bachelor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact, the mistake made by M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s relatives, who never suspected the true reason for his annual return to Balbec and for what the pedantic Mme. Bloch called his absentee palate, was really a more profound and secondary truth. For M. Nissim Bernard himself was unaware how much there was of love for the beach at Balbec, for the view one enjoyed from the restaurant over the sea, and of maniacal habits in the fancy that he had for keeping, like a dancing girl of another kind which still lacks a Degas, one of his servants the rest of whom were still girls. And so M. Nissim Bernard maintained, with the director of this theatre which was the hotel at Balbec, and with the stage-manager and producer Aim\u00e9\u2014 whose part in all this affair was anything but simple \u2014 excellent relations. One day they would intrigue to procure an important part, a place perhaps as headwaiter. In the meantime M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s pleasure, poetical and calmly contemplative as it might be, reminded one a little of those women-loving men who always know \u2014 Swann, for example, in the past \u2014 that if they go out to a party they will meet their mistress. No sooner had M. Nissim Bernard taken his seat than he would see the object of his affections appear on the scene, bearing in his hand fruit or cigars upon a tray. And so every morning, after kissing his niece, bothering my friend Bloch about his work and feeding his horses with lumps of sugar from the palm of his outstretched hand, he would betray a feverish haste to arrive in time for luncheon at the Grand Hotel. Had the house been on fire, had his niece had a stroke, he would doubtless have started off just the same. So that he dreaded like the plague a cold that would confine him to his bed \u2014 for he was a hypochondriac \u2014 and would oblige him to ask Aim\u00e9 to send his young friend across to visit him at home, between luncheon and tea-time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He loved moreover all the labyrinth of corridors, private offices, reception-rooms, cloakrooms, larders, galleries which composed the hotel at Balbec. With a strain of oriental atavism he loved a seraglio, and when he went out at night might be seen furtively exploring its passages. While, venturing down to the basement and endeavouring at the same time to escape notice and to avoid a scandal, M. Nissim Bernard, in his quest of the young L\u00e9vites, put one in mind of those lines in La Juive:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O God of our Fathers, come down to us again\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our mysteries veil from the eyes of wicked men!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I on the contrary would go up to the room of two sisters who had come to Balbec, as her maids, with an old lady, a foreigner. They were what the language of hotels called \u2018couriers,\u2019 and that of Fran\u00e7oise, who imagined that a courier was a person who was there to run his course, two \u2018coursers.\u2019 The hotels have remained, more nobly, in the period when people sang: \u201cC\u2019est un courrier de cabinet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Difficult as it was for a visitor to penetrate to the servants\u2019 quarters, I had very soon formed a mutual bond of friendship, as strong as it was pure, with these two young persons, Mademoiselle Marie Gineste and Madame C\u00e9leste Albaret. Born at the foot of the high mountains in the centre of France, on the banks of rivulets and torrents (the water passed actually under their old home, turning a millwheel, and the house had often been damaged by floods), they seemed to embody the features of that region. Marie Gineste was more regularly rapid and abrupt, C\u00e9leste Albaret softer and more languishing, spread out like a lake, but with terrible boiling rages in which her fury suggested the peril of spates and gales that sweep everything before them. They often came in the morning to see me when I was still in bed. I have never known people so deliberately ignorant, who had learned absolutely nothing at school, and yet whose language was somehow so literary that, but for the almost savage naturalness of their tone, one would have thought their speech affected. With a familiarity which I reproduce verbatim, notwithstanding the praises (which I set down here in praise not of myself but of the strange genius of C\u00e9leste) and the criticisms, equally unfounded, in which her remarks seem to involve me, while I dipped crescent rolls in my milk, C\u00e9leste would say to me: \u201cOh! Little black devil with hair of jet, O profound wickedness! I don\u2019t know what your mother was thinking of when she made you, for you are just like a bird. Look, Marie, wouldn\u2019t you say he was preening his feathers, and turning his head right round, so light he looks, you would say he was just learning to fly. Ah! It\u2019s fortunate for you that those who bred you brought you into the world to rank and riches; what would ever have become of you, so wasteful as you are. Look at him throwing away his crescent because it touched the bed. There he goes, now, look, he\u2019s spilling his milk, wait till I tie a napkin round you, for you could never do it for yourself, never in my life have I seen anyone so helpless and so clumsy as you.\u201d I would then hear the more regular sound of the torrent of Marie Gineste who was furiously reprimanding her sister: \u201cWill you hold your tongue, now, C\u00e9leste. Are you mad, talking to Monsieur like that?\u201d C\u00e9leste merely smiled; and as I detested having a napkin tied round my neck: \u201cNo, Marie, look at him, bang, he\u2019s shot straight up on end like a serpent. A proper serpent, I tell you.\u201d These were but a few of her zoological similes, for, according to her, it was impossible to tell when I slept, I fluttered about all night like a butterfly, and in the day time I was as swift as the squirrels. \u201cYou know, Marie, the way we see them at home, so nimble that even with your eyes you can\u2019t follow them.\u201d \u201cBut, C\u00e9leste, you know he doesn\u2019t like having a napkin when he\u2019s eating.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s so that he can say nobody can make him do anything against his will. He\u2019s a grand gentleman and he wants to shew that he is. They can change the sheets ten times over, if they must, but he won\u2019t give way. Yesterday\u2019s had served their time, but to-day they have only just been put on the bed and they\u2019ll have to be changed already. Oh, I was right when I said that he was never meant to be born among the poor. Look, his hair\u2019s standing on end, swelling with rage like a bird\u2019s feathers. Poor ploumissou!\u201d Here it was not only Marie that protested, but myself, for I did not feel in the least like a grand gentleman. But C\u00e9leste would never believe in the sincerity of my modesty and cut me short. \u201cOh! The story-teller! Oh! The flatterer! Oh! The false one! The cunning rogue! Oh! Moli\u00e8re!\u201d (This was the only writer\u2019s name that she knew, but she applied it to me, meaning thereby a person who was capable both of writing plays and of acting them.) \u201cC\u00e9leste!\u201d came the imperious cry from Marie, who, not knowing the name of Moli\u00e8re, was afraid that it might be some fresh insult. C\u00e9leste continued to smile: \u201cThen you haven\u2019t seen the photograph of him in his drawer, when he was little. He tried to make us believe that he was always dressed quite simply. And there, with his little cane, he\u2019s all furs and laces, such as no Prince ever wore. But that\u2019s nothing compared with his tremendous majesty and kindness which is even more profound.\u201d \u201cSo then,\u201d scolded the torrent Marie, \u201cyou go rummaging in his drawers now, do you?\u201d To calm Marie\u2019s fears I asked her what she thought of M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s behaviour. . . . \u201cAh! Monsieur, there are things I wouldn\u2019t have believed could exist. One has to come here to learn.\u201d And, for once outrivalling C\u00e9leste by an even more profound observation: \u201cAh! You see, Monsieur, one can never tell what there may be in a person\u2019s life.\u201d To change the subject, I spoke to her of the life led by my father, who toiled night and day. \u201cAh! Monsieur, there are people who keep nothing of their life for themselves, not one minute, not one pleasure, the whole thing is a sacrifice for others, they are lives that are given away.\u201d \u201cLook, Marie, he has only to put his hand on the counterpane and take his crescent, what distinction. He can do the most insignificant things, you would say that the whole nobility of France, from here to the Pyrenees, was stirring in each of his movements.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overpowered by this portrait so far from lifelike, I remained silent; C\u00e9leste interpreted my silence as a further instance of guile: \u201cOh! Brow that looks so pure, and hides so many things, nice, cool cheeks like the inside of an almond, little hands of satin all velvety, nails like claws,\u201d and so forth. \u201cThere, Marie, look at him sipping his milk with a devoutness that makes me want to say my prayers. What a serious air! They ought really to take his portrait as he is just now. He\u2019s just like a child. Is it drinking milk, like them, that has kept you their bright colour? Oh! Youth! Oh! Lovely skin. You will never grow old. You are a lucky one, you will never need to raise your hand against anyone, for you have a pair of eyes that can make their will be done. Look at him now, he\u2019s angry. He shoots up, straight as a sign-post.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise did not at all approve of what she called the two \u2018tricksters\u2019 coming to talk to me like this. The manager, who made his staff keep watch over everything that went on, even gave me a serious warning that it was not proper for a visitor to talk to servants. I, who found the \u2018tricksters\u2019 far better than any visitor in the hotel, merely laughed in his face, convinced that he would not understand my explanations. And the sisters returned. \u201cLook, Marie, at his delicate lines. Oh, perfect miniature, finer than the most precious you could see in a glass case, for he can move, and utters words you could listen to for days and nights.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a miracle that a foreign lady could have brought them there, for, without knowing anything of history or geography, they heartily detested the English, the Germans, the Russians, the Italians, all foreign vermin, and cared, with certain exceptions, for French people alone. Their faces had so far preserved the moisture of the pliable clay of their native river beds, that, as soon as one mentioned a foreigner who was staying in the hotel, in order to repeat what he had said, C\u00e9leste and Marie imposed upon their faces his face, their mouths became his mouth, their eyes his eyes, one would have liked to preserve these admirable comic masks. C\u00e9leste indeed, while pretending merely to be repeating what the manager had said, or one of my friends, would insert in her little narrative fictitious remarks in which were maliciously portrayed all the defects of Bloch, the chief magistrate, etc., while apparently unconscious of doing so. It was, under the form of the delivery of a simple message which she had obligingly undertaken to convey, an inimitable portrait. They never read anything, not even a newspaper. One day, however, they found lying on my bed a book. It was a volume of the admirable but obscure poems of Saint-L\u00e9ger L\u00e9ger. C\u00e9leste read a few pages and said to me: \u201cBut are you quite sure that these are poetry, wouldn\u2019t they just be riddles?\u201d Obviously, to a person who had learned in her childhood a single poem: \u201cDown here the lilacs die,\u201d there was a gap in evolution. I fancy that their obstinate refusal to learn anything was due in part to the unhealthy climate of their early home. They had nevertheless all the gifts of a poet with more modesty than poets generally shew. For if C\u00e9leste had said something noteworthy and, unable to remember it correctly, I asked her to repeat it, she would assure me that she had forgotten. They will never read any books, but neither will they ever write any\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise was considerably impressed when she learned that the two brothers of these humble women had married, one the niece of the Archbishop of Tours, the other a relative of the Bishop of Rodez. To the manager, this would have conveyed nothing. C\u00e9leste would sometimes reproach her husband with his failure to understand her, and as for me, I was astonished that he could endure her. For at certain moments, raging, furious, destroying everything, she was detestable. It is said that the salt liquid which is our blood is only an internal survival of the primitive marine element. Similarly, I believe that C\u00e9leste, not only in her bursts of fury, but also in her hours of depression preserved the rhythm of her native streams. When she was exhausted, it was after their fashion; she had literally run dry. Nothing could then have revived her. Then all of a sudden the circulation was restored in her large body, splendid and light. The water flowed in the opaline transparence of her bluish skin. She smiled at the sun and became bluer still. At such moments she was truly celestial\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch\u2019s family might never have suspected the reason which made their uncle never take his luncheon at home and have accepted it from the first as the mania of an elderly bachelor, due perhaps to the demands of his intimacy with some actress; everything that concerned M. Nissim Bernard was tabu to the manager of the Balbec hotel. And that was why, without even referring to the uncle, he had finally not ventured to find fault with the niece, albeit recommending her to be a little more circumspect. And so the girl and her friend who, for some days, had pictured themselves as excluded from the casino and the Grand Hotel, seeing that everything was settled, were delighted to shew those fathers of families who held aloof from them that they might with impunity take the utmost liberties. No doubt they did not go so far as to repeat the public exhibition which had revolted everybody. But gradually they returned to their old ways. And one evening as I came out of the casino which was half in darkness with Albertine and Bloch whom we had met there, they came towards us, linked together, kissing each other incessantly, and, as they passed us, crowed and laughed, uttering indecent cries. Bloch lowered his eyes, so as to seem not to have recognised his cousin, and as for myself I was tortured by the thought that this occult, appalling language was addressed perhaps to Albertine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another incident turned my thoughts even more in the direction of Gomorrah. I had noticed upon the beach a handsome young woman, erect and pale, whose eyes, round their centre, scattered rays so geometrically luminous that one was reminded, on meeting her gaze, of some constellation. I thought how much more beautiful this girl was than Albertine, and that it would be wiser to give up the other. Only, the face of this beautiful young woman had been smoothed by the invisible plane of an utterly low life, of the constant acceptance of vulgar expedients, so much so that her eyes, more noble however than the rest of her face, could radiate nothing but appetites and desires. Well, on the following day, this young woman being seated a long way away from us in the casino, I saw that she never ceased to fasten upon Albertine the alternate, circling fires of her gaze. One would have said that she was making signals to her from a lighthouse. I dreaded my friend\u2019s seeing that she was being so closely observed, I was afraid that these incessantly rekindled glances might have the conventional meaning of an amorous assignation for the morrow. For all I knew, this assignation might not be the first. The young woman with the radiant eyes might have come another year to Balbec. It was perhaps because Albertine had already yielded to her desires, or to those of a friend, that this woman allowed herself to address to her those flashing signals. If so, they did more than demand something for the present, they found a justification in pleasant hours in the past\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This assignation, in that case, must be not the first, but the sequel to adventures shared in past years. And indeed her glance did not say: \u201cWill you?\u201d As soon as the young woman had caught sight of Albertine, she had turned her head and beamed upon her glances charged with recollection, as though she were terribly afraid that my friend might not remember. Albertine, who could see her plainly, remained phlegmatically motionless, with the result that the other, with the same sort of discretion as a man who sees his old mistress with a new lover, ceased to look at her and paid no more attention to her than if she had not existed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, a day or two later, I received a proof of this young woman\u2019s tendencies, and also of the probability of her having known Albertine in the past. Often, in the hall of the casino, when two girls were smitten with mutual desire, a luminous phenomenon occurred, a sort of phosphorescent train passing from one to the other. Let us note in passing that it is by the aid of such materialisations, even if they be imponderable, by these astral signs that set fire to a whole section of the atmosphere, that the scattered Gomorrah tends, in every town, in every village, to reunite its separated members, to reform the biblical city while everywhere the same efforts are being made, be it in view of but a momentary reconstruction, by the nostalgic, the hypocritical, sometimes by the courageous exiles from Sodom\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once I saw the stranger whom Albertine had appeared not to recognise, just at the moment when Bloch\u2019s cousin was approaching her. The young woman\u2019s eyes flashed, but it was quite evident that she did not know the Israelite maiden. She beheld her for the first time, felt a desire, a shadow of doubt, by no means the same certainty as in the case of Albertine, Albertine upon whose comradeship she must so far have reckoned that, in the face of her coldness, she had felt the surprise of a foreigner familiar with Paris but not resident there, who, having returned to spend a few weeks there, on the site of the little theatre where he was in the habit of spending pleasant evenings, sees that they have now built a bank\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch\u2019s cousin went and sat down at a table where she turned the pages of a magazine. Presently the young woman came and sat down, with an abstracted air, by her side. But under the table one could presently see their feet wriggling, then their legs and hands, in a confused heap. Words followed, a conversation began, and the young woman\u2019s innocent husband, who had been looking everywhere for her, was astonished to find her making plans for that very evening with a girl whom he did not know. His wife introduced Bloch\u2019s cousin to him as a friend of her childhood, by an inaudible name, for she had forgotten to ask her what her name was. But the husband\u2019s presence made their intimacy advance a stage farther, for they addressed each other as tu, having known each other at their convent, an incident at which they laughed heartily later on, as well as at the hoodwinked husband, with a gaiety which afforded them an excuse for more caresses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for Albertine, I cannot say that anywhere in the casino or on the beach was her behaviour with any girl unduly free. I found in it indeed an excess of coldness and indifference which seemed to be more than good breeding, to be a ruse planned to avert suspicion. When questioned by some girl, she had a quick, icy, decent way of replying in a very loud voice: \u201cYes, I shall be going to the tennis court about five. I shall bathe to-morrow morning about eight,\u201d and of at once turning away from the person to whom she had said this \u2014 all of which had a horrible appearance of being meant to put people off the scent, and either to make an assignation, or, the assignation already made in a whisper, to utter this speech, harmless enough in itself, aloud, so as not to attract attention. And when later on I saw her mount her bicycle and scorch away into the distance, I could not help thinking that she was hurrying to overtake the girl to whom she had barely spoken\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only, when some handsome young woman stepped out of a motor-car at the end of the beach, Albertine could not help turning round. And she at once explained: \u201cI was looking at the new flag they\u2019ve put up over the bathing place. The old one was pretty moth-eaten. But I really think this one is mouldier still.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On one occasion Albertine was not content with cold indifference, and this made me all the more wretched. She knew that I was annoyed by the possibility of her sometimes meeting a friend of her aunt, who had a \u2018bad style\u2019 and came now and again to spend a few days with Mme. Bontemps. Albertine had pleased me by telling me that she would not speak to her again. And when this woman came to Incarville, Albertine said: \u201cBy the way, you know she\u2019s here. Have they told you?\u201d as though to shew me that she was not seeing her in secret. One day, when she told me this, she added: \u201cYes, I ran into her on the beach, and knocked against her as I passed, on purpose, to be rude to her.\u201d When Albertine told me this, there came back to my mind a remark made by Mme. Bontemps, to which I had never given a second thought, when she had said to Mme. Swann in my presence how brazen her niece Albertine was, as though that were a merit, and told her how Albertine had reminded some official\u2019s wife that her father had been employed in a kitchen. But a thing said by her whom we love does not long retain its purity; it withers, it decays. An evening or two later, I thought again of Albertine\u2019s remark, and it was no longer the ill breeding of which she was so proud \u2014 and which could only make me smile \u2014 that it seemed to me to signify, it was something else, to wit that Albertine, perhaps even without any definite object, to irritate this woman\u2019s senses, or wantonly to remind her of former proposals, accepted perhaps in the past, had swiftly brushed against her, thought that I had perhaps heard of this as it had been done in public, and had wished to forestall an unfavourable interpretation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the jealousy that was caused me by the women whom Albertine perhaps loved was abruptly to cease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were waiting, Albertine and I, at the Balbec station of the little local railway. We had driven there in the hotel omnibus, because it was raining. Not far away from us was M. Nissim Bernard, with a black eye. He had recently forsaken the chorister from Athalie for the waiter at a much frequented farmhouse in the neighbourhood, known as the \u2018Cherry Orchard.\u2019 This rubicund youth, with his blunt features, appeared for all the world to have a tomato instead of a head. A tomato exactly similar served as head to his twin brother. To the detached observer there is this attraction about these perfect resemblances between pairs of twins, that nature, becoming for the moment industrialised, seems to be offering a pattern for sale. Unfortunately M. Nissim Bernard looked at it from another point of view, and this resemblance was only external. Tomato II shewed a frenzied zeal in furnishing the pleasures exclusively of ladies, Tomato I did not mind condescending to meet the wishes of certain gentlemen. Now on each occasion when, stirred, as though by a reflex action, by the memory of pleasant hours spent with Tomato I, M. Bernard presented himself at the Cherry Orchard, being short-sighted (not that one need be short-sighted to mistake them), the old Israelite, unconsciously playing Amphitryon, would accost the twin brother with: \u201cWill you meet me somewhere this evening?\u201d He at once received a resounding smack in the face. It might even be repeated in the course of a single meal, when he continued with the second brother the conversation he had begun with the first. In the end this treatment so disgusted him, by association of ideas, with tomatoes, even of the edible variety, that whenever he heard a newcomer order that vegetable, at the next table to his own, in the Grand Hotel, he would murmur to him: \u201cYou must excuse me, Sir, for addressing you, without an introduction. But I heard you order tomatoes. They are stale to-day. I tell you in your own interest, for it makes no difference to me, I never touch them myself.\u201d The stranger would reply with effusive thanks to this philanthropic and disinterested neighbour, call back the waiter, pretend to have changed his mind: \u201cNo, on second thoughts, certainly not, no tomatoes.\u201d Aim\u00e9, who had seen it all before, would laugh to himself, and think: \u201cHe\u2019s an old rascal, that Monsieur Bernard, he\u2019s gone and made another of them change his order.\u201d M. Bernard, as he waited for the already overdue tram, shewed no eagerness to speak to Albertine and myself, because of his black eye. We were even less eager to speak to him. It would however have been almost inevitable if, at that moment, a bicycle had not come dashing towards us; the lift-boy sprang from its saddle, breathless. Madame Verdurin had telephoned shortly after we left the hotel, to know whether I would dine with her two days later; we shall see presently why. Then, having given me the message in detail, the lift-boy left us, and, being one of these democratic \u2018employees\u2019 who affect independence with regard to the middle classes, and among themselves restore the principle of authority, explained: \u201cI must be off, because of my chiefs.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine\u2019s girl friends had gone, and would be away for some time. I was anxious to provide her with distractions. Even supposing that she might have found some happiness in spending the afternoons with no company but my own, at Balbec, I knew that such happiness is never complete, and that Albertine, being still at the age (which some of us never outgrow) when we have not yet discovered that this imperfection resides in the person who receives the happiness and not in the person who gives it, might have been tempted to put her disappointment down to myself. I preferred that she should impute it to circumstances which, arranged by myself, would not give us an opportunity of being alone together, while at the same time preventing her from remaining in the casino and on the beach without me. And so I had asked her that day to come with me to Donci\u00e8res, where I was going to meet Saint-Loup. With a similar hope of occupying her mind, I advised her to take up painting, in which she had had lessons in the past. While working she would not ask herself whether she was happy or unhappy. I would gladly have taken her also to dine now and again with the Verdurins and the Cambremers, who certainly would have been delighted to see any friend introduced by myself, but I must first make certain that Mme. Putbus was not yet at la Raspeli\u00e8re. It was only by going there in person that I could make sure of this, and, as I knew beforehand that on the next day but one Albertine would be going on a visit with her aunt, I had seized this opportunity to send Mme. Verdurin a telegram asking her whether she would be at home upon Wednesday. If Mme. Putbus was there, I would manage to see her maid, ascertain whether there was any danger of her coming to Balbec, and if so find out when, so as to take Albertine out of reach on the day. The little local railway, making a loop which did not exist at the time when I had taken it with my grandmother, now extended to Donci\u00e8res-la-Goupil, a big station at which important trains stopped, among them the express by which I had come down to visit Saint-Loup, from Paris, and the corresponding express by which I had returned. And, because of the bad weather, the omnibus from the Grand Hotel took Albertine and myself to the station of the little tram, Balbec-Plage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The little train had not yet arrived, but one could see, lazy and slow, the plume of smoke that it had left in its wake, which, confined now to its own power of locomotion as an almost stationary cloud, was slowly mounting the green slope of the cliff of Criquetot. Finally the little tram, which it had preceded by taking a vertical course, arrived in its turn, at a leisurely crawl. The passengers who were waiting to board it stepped back to make way for it, but without hurrying, knowing that they were dealing with a good-natured, almost human traveller, who, guided like the bicycle of a beginner, by the obliging signals of the station-master, in the strong hands of the engine-driver, was in no danger of running over anybody, and would come to a halt at the proper place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My telegram explained the Verdurins\u2019 telephone message and had been all the more opportune since Wednesday (the day I had fixed happened to be a Wednesday) was the day set apart for dinner-parties by Mme. Verdurin, at la Raspeli\u00e8re, as in Paris, a fact of which I was unaware. Mme. Verdurin did not give \u2018dinners,\u2019 but she had \u2018Wednesdays.\u2019 These Wednesdays were works of art. While fully conscious that they had not their match anywhere, Mme. Verdurin introduced shades of distinction between them. \u201cLast Wednesday was not as good as the one before,\u201d she would say. \u201cBut I believe the next will be one of the best I have ever given.\u201d Sometimes she went so far as to admit: \u201cThis Wednesday was not worthy of the others. But I have a big surprise for you next week.\u201d In the closing weeks of the Paris season, before leaving for the country, the Mistress would announce the end of the Wednesdays. It gave her an opportunity to stimulate the faithful. \u201cThere are only three more Wednesdays left, there are only two more,\u201d she would say, in the same tone as though the world were coming to an end. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to miss next Wednesday, for the finale.\u201d But this finale was a sham, for she would announce: \u201cOfficially, there will be no more Wednesdays. To-day was the last for this year. But I shall be at home all the same on Wednesday. We shall have a little Wednesday to ourselves; I dare say these little private Wednesdays will be the nicest of all.\u201d At la Raspeli\u00e8re, the Wednesdays were of necessity restricted, and since, if they had discovered a friend who was passing that way, they would invite him for one or another evening, almost every day of the week became a Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t remember all the guests, but I know there\u2019s Madame la Marquise de Camembert,\u201d the liftboy had told me; his memory of our discussion of the name Cambremer had not succeeded in definitely supplanting that of the old world, whose syllables, familiar and full of meaning, came to the young employee\u2019s rescue when he was embarrassed by this difficult name, and were immediately preferred and readopted by him, not by any means from laziness or as an old and ineradicable usage, but because of the need for logic and clarity which they satisfied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hastened in search of an empty carriage in which I could hold Alber-tine in my arms throughout the journey. Having failed to find one, we got into a compartment in which there was already installed a lady with a massive face, old and ugly, with a masculine expression, very much in her Sunday best, who was reading the Revue des Deux Mondes. Notwithstanding her commonness, she was eclectic in her tastes, and I found amusement in asking myself to what social category she could belong; I at once concluded that she must be the manager of some large brothel, a procuress on holiday. Her face, her manner, proclaimed the fact aloud. Only, I had never yet supposed that such ladies read the Revue des Deux Mondes. Albertine drew my attention to her with a wink and a smile. The lady wore an air of extreme dignity; and as I, for my part, bore within me the consciousness that I was invited, two days later, to the terminal point of the little railway, by the famous Mme. Verdurin, that at an intermediate station I was awaited by Robert de Saint-Loup, and that a little farther on I had it in my power to give great pleasure to Mme. de Cambremer, by going to stay at F\u00e9terne, my eyes sparkled with irony as I studied this self-important lady who seemed to think that, because of her elaborate attire, the feathers in her hat, her Revue des Deux Mondes, she was a more considerable personage than myself. I hoped that the lady would not remain in the train much longer than M. Nissim Bernard, and that she would alight at least at Toutainville, but no. The train stopped at Evreville, she remained seated. Similarly at Montmartin-sur-Mer, at Parville-la-Bingard, at Incarville, so that in despair, when the train had left Saint-Frichoux, which was the last station before Donci\u00e8res, I began to embrace Albertine without bothering about the lady. At Donci\u00e8res, Saint-Loup had come to meet me at the station, with the greatest difficulty, he told me, for, as he was staying with his aunt, my telegram had only just reached him and he could not, having been unable to make any arrangements beforehand, spare me more than an hour of his time. This hour seemed to me, alas, far too long, for as soon as we had left the train Albertine devoted her whole attention to Saint-Loup. She never talked to me, barely answered me if I addressed her, repulsed me when I approached her. With Robert, on the other hand, she laughed her provoking laugh, talked to him volubly, played with the dog he had brought with him, and, as she excited the animal, deliberately rubbed against its master. I remembered that, on the day when Albertine had allowed me to kiss her for the first time, I had had a smile of gratitude for the unknown seducer who had wrought so profound a change in her and had so far simplified my task. I thought of him now with horror. Robert must have noticed that I was not unconcerned about Albertine, for he offered no response to her provocations, which made her extremely annoyed with myself; then he spoke to me as though I had been alone, which, when she realised it, raised me again in her esteem. Robert asked me if I would not like to meet those of his friends with whom he used to make me dine every evening at Donci\u00e8res, when I was staying there, who were still in the garrison. And as he himself adopted that irritating manner which he rebuked in others: \u201cWhat is the good of your having worked so hard to charm them if you don\u2019t want to see them again?\u201d I declined his offer, for I did not wish to run any risk of being parted from Albertine, but also because now I was detached from them. From them, which is to say from myself. We passionately long that there may be another life in which we shall be similar to what we are here below. But we do not pause to reflect that, even without waiting for that other life, in this life, after a few years we are unfaithful to what we have been, to what we wished to remain immortally. Even without supposing that death is to alter us more completely than the changes that occur in the course of a lifetime, if in that other life we were to encounter the self that we have been, we should turn away from ourselves as from those people with whom we were once on friendly terms but whom we have not seen for years \u2014 such as Saint-Loup\u2019s friends whom I used so much to enjoy meeting again every evening at the Faisan Dor\u00e9, and whose conversation would now have seemed to me merely a boring importunity. In this respect, and because I preferred not to go there in search of what had pleased me there in the past, a stroll through Donci\u00e8res. might have seemed to me a pr\u00e9figuration of an arrival in Paradise. We dream much of Paradise, or rather of a number of successive Paradises, but each of them is, long before we die, a Paradise lost, in which we should feel ourselves lost also\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He left us at the station. \u201cBut you may have about an hour to wait,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf you spend it here, you will probably see my uncle Charlus, who is going by the train to Paris, ten minutes before yours. I have said good-bye to him already, because I have to go back before his train starts. I didn\u2019t tell him about you, because I hadn\u2019t got your telegram.\u201d To the reproaches which I heaped upon Albertine when Saint-Loup had left us, she replied that she had intended, by her coldness towards me, to destroy any idea that he might have formed if, at the moment when the train stopped, he had seen me leaning against her with my arm round her waist. He had indeed noticed this attitude (I had not caught sight of him, otherwise I should have adopted one that was more correct), and had had time to murmur in my ear: \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is, one of those priggish little girls you told me about, who wouldn\u2019t go near Mlle. de Stermaria because they thought her fast?\u201d I had indeed mentioned to Robert, and in all sincerity, when I went down from Paris to visit him at Donci\u00e8res, and when we were talking about our time at Balbec, that there was nothing to be had from Albertine, that she was the embodiment of virtue. And now that I had long since discovered for myself that this was false, I was even more anxious that Robert should believe it to be true. It would have been sufficient for me to tell Robert that I was in love with Albertine. He was one of those people who are capable of denying themselves a pleasure to spare their friend sufferings which they would feel even more keenly if they themselves were the victims. \u201cYes, she is still rather childish. But you don\u2019t know anything against her?\u201d I added anxiously. \u201cNothing, except that I saw you clinging together like a pair of lovers.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYour attitude destroyed absolutely nothing,\u201d I told Albertine when Saint-Loup had left us. \u201cQuite true,\u201d she said to me, \u201cit was stupid of me, I hurt your feelings, I\u2019m far more unhappy about it than you are. You\u2019ll see, I shall never be like that again; forgive me,\u201d she pleaded, holding out her hand with a sorrowful air. At that moment, from the entrance to the waiting-room in which we were sitting, I saw advance slowly, followed at a respectful distance by a porter loaded with his baggage, M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Paris, where I encountered him only in evening dress, immobile, straitlaced in a black coat, maintained in a vertical posture by his proud aloofness, his thirst for admiration, the soar of his conversation, I had never realised how far he had aged. Now, in a light travelling suit which made him appear stouter, as he swaggered through the room, balancing a pursy stomach and an almost symbolical behind, the cruel light of day broke up into paint, upon his lips, rice-powder fixed by cold cream, on the tip of his nose, black upon his dyed moustaches whose ebon tint formed a contrast to his grizzled hair, all that by artificial light had seemed the animated colouring of a man who was still young\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I stood talking to him, though briefly, because of his train, I kept my eye on Albertine\u2019s carriage to shew her that I was coming. When I turned my head towards M. de Charlus, he asked nie to be so kind as to summon a soldier, a relative of his, who was standing on the other side of the platform, as though he were waiting to take our train, but in the opposite direction, away from Balbec. \u201cHe is in his regimental band,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cAs you are so fortunate as to be still young enough, and I unfortunately am old enough for you to save me the trouble of going across to him.\u201d I took it upon myself to go across to the soldier he pointed out to me, and saw from the lyres embroidered on his collar that he was a bandsman. But, just as I was preparing to execute my commission, what was my surprise, and, I may say, my pleasure, on recognising Morel, the son of my uncle\u2019s valet, who recalled to me so many memories. They made me forget to convey M. de Charlus\u2019s message. \u201cWhat, you are at Donci\u00e8res?\u201d \u201cYes, and they\u2019ve put me in the band attached to the batteries.\u201d But he made this answer in a dry and haughty tone. He had become an intense \u2018poseur,\u2019 and evidently the sight of myself, reminding him of his father\u2019s profession, was not pleasing to him. Suddenly I saw M. de Charlus descending upon us. My delay had evidently taxed his patience. \u201cI should like to listen to a little music this evening,\u201d he said to Morel without any preliminaries, \u201cI pay five hundred francs for the evening, which may perhaps be of interest to one of your friends, if you have any in the band.\u201d Knowing as I did the insolence of M. de Charlus, I was astonished at his not even saying how d\u2019ye do to his young friend. The Baron did not however give me time to think. Holding out his hand in the friendliest manner: \u201cGood-bye, my dear fellow,\u201d he said, as a hint that I might now leave them. I had, as it happened, left my dear Albertine too long alone. \u201cD\u2019you know,\u201d I said to her as I climbed into the carriage, \u201clife by the sea-side and travelling make me realise that the theatre of the world is stocked with fewer settings than actors, and with fewer actors than situations.\u201d \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d \u201cBecause M. de Charlus asked me just now to fetch one of his friends, whom, this instant, on the platform of this station, I have just discovered to be one of my own.\u201d But as I uttered these words, I began to wonder how the Baron could have bridged the social gulf to which I had not given a thought. It occurred to me first of all that it might be through Jupien, whose niece, as the reader may remember, had seemed to shew a preference for the violinist. What did baffle me completely was that, when due to leave for Paris in five minutes, the Baron should have asked for a musical evening. But, visualising Jupien\u2019s niece again in my memory, I was beginning to find that \u2018recognitions\u2019 did indeed play an important part in life, when all of a sudden the truth flashed across my mind and I realised that I had been absurdly innocent. M. de Charlus had never in his life set eyes upon Morel, nor Morel upon M. de Charlus, who, dazzled but also terrified by a warrior, albeit he bore no weapon but a lyre, had called upon me in his emotion to bring him the person whom he never suspected that I already knew. In any case, the offer of five hundred francs must have made up to Morel for the absence of any previous relations, for I saw that they continued to talk, without reflecting that they were standing close beside our tram. As I recalled the manner in which M. de Charlus had come up to Morel and myself, I saw at once the resemblance to certain of his relatives, when they picked up a woman in the street. Only the desired object had changed its sex. After a certain age, and even if different evolutions are occurring in us, the more we become ourselves, the more our characteristic features are accentuated. For Nature, while harmoniously contributing the design of her tapestry, breaks the monotony of the composition thanks to the variety of the intercepted forms. Besides, the arrogance with which M. de Charlus had accosted the violinist is relative, and depends upon the point of view one adopts. It would have been recognised by three out of four of the men in society who nodded their heads to him, not by the prefect of police who, a few years later, was to keep him under observation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Paris train is signalled, Sir,\u201d said the porter who was carrying his luggage. \u201cBut I am not going by the train, put it in the cloakroom, damn you!\u201d said M. de Charlus, as he gave twenty francs to the porter, astonished by the change of plan and charmed by the tip. This generosity at once attracted a flower-seller. \u201cBuy these carnations, look, this lovely rose, kind gentlemen, it will bring you luck.\u201d M. de Charlus, out of patience, handed her a couple of francs, in exchange for which the woman gave him her blessing, and her flowers as well. \u201cGood God, why can\u2019t she leave us alone,\u201d said M. de Charlus, addressing himself in an ironical and complaining tone, as of a man distraught, to Morel, to whom he found a certain comfort in appealing. \u201cWe\u2019ve quite enough to talk about as it is.\u201d Perhaps the porter was not yet out of earshot, perhaps M. de Charlus did not care to have too numerous an audience, perhaps these incidental remarks enabled his lofty timidity not to approach too directly the request for an assignation. The musician, turning with a frank, imperative and decided air to the flower-seller, raised a hand which repulsed her and indicated to her that they did not want her flowers and that she was to get out of their way as quickly as possible. M. de Charlus observed with ecstasy this authoritative, virile gesture, made by the graceful hand for which it ought still to have been too weighty, too massively brutal, with a precocious firmness and suppleness which gave to this still beardless adolescent the air of a young David capable of waging war against Goliath. The Baron\u2019s admiration was unconsciously blended with the smile with which we observe in a child an expression of gravity beyond his years. \u201cThis is a person whom I should like to accompany me on my travels and help me in my business. How he would simplify my life,\u201d M. de Charlus said to himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The train for Paris (which M. de Charlus did not take) started. Then we took our seats in our own train, Albertine and I, without my knowing what had become of M. de Charlus and Morel. \u201cWe must never quarrel any more, I beg your pardon again,\u201d Albertine repeated, alluding to the Saint-Loup incident. \u201cWe must always be nice to each other,\u201d she said tenderly. \u201cAs for your friend Saint-Loup, if you think that I am the least bit interested in him, you are quite mistaken. All that I like about him is that he seems so very fond of you.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a very good fellow,\u201d I said, taking care not to supply Robert with those imaginary excellences which I should not have failed to invent, out of friendship for himself, had I been with anybody but Albertine. \u201cHe\u2019s an excellent creature, frank, devoted, loyal, a person you can rely on to do anything.\u201d In saying this I confined myself, held in check by my jealousy, to telling the truth about Saint-Loup, but what I said was literally true. It found expression in precisely the same terms that Mme. de Villeparisis had employed in speaking to me of him, when I did not yet know him, imagined him to be so different, so proud, and said to myself: \u201cPeople think him good because he is a great gentleman.\u201d Just as when she had said to me: \u201cHe would be so pleased,\u201d I imagined, after seeing him outside the hotel, preparing to drive away, that his aunt\u2019s speech had been a mere social banality, intended to natter me. And I had realised afterwards that she had said what she did sincerely, thinking of the things that interested me, of my reading, and because she knew that that was what Saint-Loup liked, as it was to be my turn to say sincerely to somebody who was writing a history of his ancestor La Rochefoucauld, the author of the Maximes, who wished to consult Robert about him: \u201cHe will be so pleased.\u201d It was simply that I had learned to know him. But, when I set eyes on him for the first time, I had not supposed that an intelligence akin to my own could be enveloped in so much outward elegance of dress and attitude. By his feathers I had judged him to be a bird of another species. It was Albertine now who, perhaps a little because Saint-Loup, in his kindness to myself, had been so cold to her, said to me what I had already thought: \u201cAh! He is as devoted as all that! I notice that people always find all the virtues in other people, when they belong to the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\u201d Now that Saint-Loup belonged to the Faubourg Saint-Germain was a thing of which I had never once thought in the course of all these years in which, stripping himself of his prestige, he had displayed to me his virtues. A change in our perspective in looking at other people, more striking already in friendship than in merely social relations, but how much more striking still in love, where desire on so vast a scale increases to such proportions the slightest signs of coolness, that far less than the coolness Saint-Loup had shewn me in the beginning had been enough to make me suppose at first that Albertine scorned me, imagine her friends to be creatures marvellously inhuman, and ascribe merely to the indulgence that people feel for beauty and for a certain elegance, Elstir\u2019s judgment when he said to me of the little band, with just the same sentiment as Mme. de Villeparisis speaking of Saint-Loup: \u201cThey are good girls.\u201d But this was not the opinion that I would instinctively have formed when I heard Albertine say: \u201cIn any case, whether he\u2019s devoted or not, I sincerely hope I shall never see him again, since he\u2019s made us quarrel. We must never quarrel again. It isn\u2019t nice.\u201d I felt, since she had seemed to desire Saint-Loup, almost cured for the time being of the idea that she cared for women, which I had supposed to be incurable. And, faced by Albertine\u2019s mackintosh in which she seemed to have become another person, the tireless vagrant of rainy days, and which, close-fitting, malleable and grey, seemed at that moment not so much intended to protect her garments from the rain as to have been soaked by her and to be clinging to my mistress\u2019s body as though to take the imprint of her form for a sculptor, I tore apart that tunic which jealously espoused a longed-for bosom and, drawing Albertine towards me: \u201cBut won\u2019t you, indolent traveller, dream upon my shoulder, resting your brow upon it?\u201d I said, taking her head in my hands, and shewing her the wide meadows, flooded and silent, which extended in the gathering dusk to the horizon closed by the parallel openings of valleys far and blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two days later, on the famous Wednesday, in that same little train, which I had again taken, at Balbec, to go and dine at la Raspeli\u00e8re, I was taking care not to miss Cottard at Graincourt-Saint-Vast, where a second telephone message from Mme. Verdurin had told me that I should find him. He was to join my train and would tell me where we had to get out to pick up the carriages that would be sent from la Raspeli\u00e8re to the station. And so, as the little train barely stopped for a moment at Graincourt, the first station after Donci\u00e8res, I was standing in readiness at the open window, so afraid was I of not seeing Cottard or of his not seeing me. Vain fears! I had not realised to what an extent the little clan had moulded all its regular members after the same type, so that they, being moreover in full evening dress, as they stood waiting upon the platform, let themselves be recognised immediately by a certain air of assurance, fashion and familiarity, by a look in their eyes which seemed to sweep, like an empty space in which there was nothing to arrest their attention, the serried ranks of the common herd, watched for the arrival of some fellow-member who had taken the train at an earlier station, and sparkled in anticipation of the talk that was to come. This sign of election, with which the habit of dining together had marked the members of the little group, was not all that distinguished them; when numerous, in full strength, they were massed together, forming a more brilliant patch in the midst of the troop of passengers \u2014 what Brichot called the pecus \u2014 upon whose dull countenances could be read no conception of what was meant by the name Verdurin, no hope of ever dining at la Raspeli\u00e8re. To be sure, these common travellers would have been less interested than myself had anyone quoted in their hearing \u2014 notwithstanding the notoriety that several of them had achieved \u2014 the names of those of the faithful whom I was astonished to see continuing to dine out, when many of them had already been doing so, according to the stories that I had heard, before my birth, at a period at once so distant and so vague that I was inclined to exaggerate its remoteness. The contrast between the continuance not only of their existence, but of the fulness of their powers, and the annihilation of so many friends whom I had already seen, in one place or another, pass away, gave me the same sentiment that we feel when in the stop-press column of the newspapers we read the very announcement that we least expected, for instance that of an untimely death, which seems to us fortuitous because the causes that have led up to it have remained outside our knowledge. This is the feeling that death does not descend upon all men alike, but that a more oncoming wave of its tragic tide carries off a life placed at the same level as others which the waves that follow will long continue to spare. We shall see later on that the diversity of the forms of death that circulate invisibly is the cause of the peculiar unexpectedness presented, in the newspapers, by their obituary notices. Then I saw that, with the passage of time, not only do the real talents that may coexist with the most commonplace conversation reveal and impose themselves, but furthermore that mediocre persons arrive at those exalted positions, attached in the imagination of our childhood to certain famous elders, when it never occurred to us that, after a certain number of years, their disciples, become masters, would be famous also, and would inspire the respect and awe that once they felt. But if the names of the faithful were unknown to the pecus, their aspect still singled them out in its eyes. Indeed in the train (when the coincidence of what one or another of them might have been doing during the day, assembled them all together), having to collect at a subsequent station only an isolated member, the carriage in which they were gathered, ticketed with the elbow of the sculptor Ski, flagged with Cottard\u2019s Temps, stood out in the distance like a special saloon, and rallied at the appointed station the tardy comrade. The only one who might, because of his semi-blindness, have missed these welcoming signals, was Brichot. But one of the party would always volunteer to keep a look-out for the blind man, and, as soon as his straw hat, his green umbrella and blue spectacles caught the eye, he would be gently but hastily guided towards the chosen compartment. So that it was inconceivable that one of the faithful, without exciting the gravest suspicions of his being \u2018on the loose,\u2019 or even of his not having come \u2018by the train,\u2019 should not pick up the others in the course of the journey. Sometimes the opposite process occurred: one of the faithful had been obliged to go some distance down the line during the afternoon and was obliged in consequence to make part of the journey alone before being joined by the group; but even when thus isolated, alone of his kind, he did not fail as a rule to produce a certain effect. The Future towards which he was travelling marked him out to the person on the seat opposite, who would say to himself: \u201cThat must be somebody,\u201d would discern, round the soft hat of Cottard or of the sculptor Ski, a vague aureole and would be only half-astonished when at the next station an elegant crowd, if it were their terminal point, greeted the faithful one at the carriage door and escorted him to one of the waiting carriages, all of them reverently saluted by the factotum of Douville station, or, if it were an intermediate station, invaded the compartment. This was what was done, and with precipitation, for some of them had arrived late, just as the train which was already in the station was about to start, by the troop which Cottard led at a run towards the carriage in the window of which he had seen me signalling. Brichot, who was among these faithful, had become more faithful than ever in the course of these years which had diminished the assiduity of others. As his sight became steadily weaker, he had been obliged, even in Paris, to reduce more and more his working hours after dark. Besides he was out of sympathy with the modern Sorbonne, where ideas of scientific exactitude, after the German model, were beginning to prevail over humanism. He now confined himself exclusively to his lectures and to his duties as an examiner; and so had a great deal more time to devote to social pursuits. That is to say, to evenings at the Verdurins\u2019, or to those parties that now and again were offered to the Verdurins by one of the faithful, tremulous with emotion. It is true that on two occasions love had almost succeeded in achieving what his work could no longer do, in detaching Brichot from the little clan. But Mme. Verdurin, who kept her eyes open, and moreover, having acquired the habit in the interests of her salon, had come to take a disinterested pleasure in this sort of drama and execution, had immediately brought about a coolness between him and the dangerous person, being skilled in (as she expressed it) \u2018putting things in order\u2019 and \u2018applying the red hot iron to the wound.\u2019 This she had found all the more easy in the case of one of the dangerous persons, who was simply Brichot\u2019s laundress, and Mme. Verdurin, having the right of entry into the Professor\u2019s fifth floor rooms, crimson with rage, when she deigned to climb his stairs, had only had to shut the door in the wretched woman\u2019s face. \u201cWhat!\u201d the Mistress had said to Brichot, \u201ca woman like myself does you the honour of calling upon you, and you receive a creature like that?\u201d Brichot had never forgotten the service that Mme. Verdurin had rendered him by preventing his old age from foundering in the mire, and became more and more strongly attached to her, whereas, in contrast to this revival of affection and possibly because of it, the Mistress was beginning to be tired of a too docile follower, and of an obedience of which she could be certain beforehand. But Brichot derived from his intimacy with the Verdurins a distinction which set him apart from all his colleagues at the Sorbonne. They were dazzled by the accounts that he gave them of dinner-parties to which they would never be invited, by the mention made of him in the reviews, the exhibition of his portrait in the Salon, by some writer or painter of repute whose talent the occupants of the other chairs in the Faculty of Arts esteemed, but without any prospect of attracting his attention, not to mention the elegance of the mundane philosopher\u2019s attire, an elegance which they had mistaken at first for slackness until their colleague kindly explained to them that a tall hat is naturally laid on the floor, when one is paying a call, and is not the right thing for dinners in the country, however smart, where it should be replaced by a soft hat, which goes quite well with a dinner-jacket. For the first few moments after the little group had plunged into the carriage, I could not even speak to Cottard, for he was suffocated, not so much by having run in order not to miss the train as by his astonishment at having caught it so exactly. He felt more than the joy inherent in success, almost the hilarity of an excellent joke. \u201cAh! That was a good one!\u201d he said when he had recovered himself. \u201cA minute later! \u2018Pon my soul, that\u2019s what they call arriving in the nick of time!\u201d he added, with a wink intended not so much to inquire whether the expression were apt, for he was now overflowing with assurance, but to express his satisfaction. At length he was able to introduce me to the other members of the little clan. I was annoyed to see that they were almost all in the dress which in Paris is called smoking. I had forgotten that the Verdurins were beginning a timid evolution towards fashionable ways, retarded by the Dreyfus case, accelerated by the \u2018new\u2019 music, an evolution which for that matter they denied, and continued to deny until it was complete, like those military objectives which a general does not announce until he has reached them, so as not to appear defeated if he fails. In addition to which, Society was quite prepared to go half way to meet them. It went so far as to regard them as people to whose house nobody in Society went but who were not in the least perturbed by the fact. The Verdurin salon was understood to be a Temple of Music. It was there, people assured you, that Vinteuil had found inspiration, encouragement. Now, even if Vinteuil\u2019s sonata remained wholly unappreciated, and almost unknown, his name, quoted as that of the greatest of modern composers, had an extraordinary effect. Moreover, certain young men of the Faubourg having decided that they ought to be more intellectual than the middle classes, there were three of them who had studied music, and among these Vinteuil\u2019s sonata enjoyed an enormous vogue. They would speak of it, on returning to their homes, to the intelligent mothers who had incited them to acquire culture. And, taking an interest in what interested their sons, at a concert these mothers would gaze with a certain respect at Mme. Verdurin in her front box, following the music in the printed score. So far, this social success latent in the Verdurins was revealed by two facts only. In the first place, Mme. Verdurin would say of the Principessa di Caprarola: \u201cAh! She is intelligent, she is a charming woman. What I cannot endure, are the imbeciles, the people who bore me, they drive me mad.\u201d Which would have made anybody at all perspicacious realise that the Principessa di Caprarola, a woman who moved in the highest society, had called upon Mme. Verdurin. She had even mentioned her name in the course of a visit of condolence which she had paid to Mme. Swann after the death of her husband, and had asked whether she knew them. \u201cWhat name did you say?\u201d Odette had asked, with a sudden wistfulness. \u201cVerdurin? Oh, yes, of course,\u201d she had continued in a plaintive tone, \u201cI don\u2019t know them, or rather, I know them without really knowing them, they are people I used to meet at people\u2019s houses, years ago, they are quite nice.\u201d When the Principessa di Caprarola had gone, Odette would fain have spoken the bare truth. But the immediate falsehood was not the fruit of her calculations, but the revelation of her fears, of her desires. She denied not what it would have been adroit to deny, but what she would have liked not to have happened, even if the other person was bound to hear an hour later that it was a fact. A little later she had recovered her assurance, and would indeed anticipate questions by saying, so as not to appear to be afraid of them: \u201cMme. Verdurin, why, I used to know her terribly well!\u201d with an affectation of humility, like a great lady who tells you that she has taken the tram. \u201cThere has been a great deal of talk about the Verdurins lately,\u201d said Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. Odette, with the smiling disdain of a Duchess, replied: \u201cYes, I do seem to have heard a lot about them lately. Every now and then there are new people who arrive like that in society,\u201d without reflecting that she herself was among the newest. \u201cThe Principessa di Caprarola has dined there,\u201d Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 went on. \u201cAh!\u201d replied Odette, accentuating her smile, \u201cthat does not surprise me. That sort of thing always begins with the Principessa di Caprarola, and then some one else follows suit, like Comtesse Mole.\u201d Odette, in saying this, appeared to be filled with a profound contempt for the two great ladies who made a habit of \u2018house-warming\u2019 in recently established drawing-rooms. One felt from her tone that the implication was that she, Odette, was, like Mme. de Souvr\u00e9, not the sort of person to let herself in for that sort of thing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the admission that Mme. Verdurin had made of the Principessa di Caprarola\u2019s intelligence, the second indication that the Verdurins were conscious of their future destiny was that (without, of course, their having formally requested it) they became most anxious that people should now come to dine with them in evening dress. M. Verdurin could now have been greeted without shame by his nephew, the one who was \u2018in the cart.\u2019 Among those who entered my carriage at Graincourt was Saniette, who long ago had been expelled from the Verdurins\u2019 by his cousin Forcheville, but had since returned. His faults, from the social point of view, had originally been \u2014 notwithstanding his superior qualities \u2014 something like Cottard\u2019s, shyness, anxiety to please, fruitless attempts to succeed in doing so. But if the course of life, by making Cottard assume, if not at the Verdurins\u2019, where he had, because of the influence that past associations exert over us when we find ourselves in familiar surroundings, remained more or less the same, at least in his practice, in his hospital ward, at the Academy of Medicine, a shell of coldness, disdain, gravity, that became more accentuated while he rewarded his appreciative students with puns, had made a clean cut between the old Cottard and the new, the same defects had on the contrary become exaggerated in Saniette, the more he sought to correct them. Conscious that he was frequently boring, that people did not listen to him, instead of then slackening his pace as Cottard would have done, of forcing their attention by an air of authority, not only did he try by adopting a humorous tone to make them forgive the unduly serious turn of his conversation, he increased his pace, cleared the ground, used abbreviations in order to appear less long-winded, more familiar with the matters of which he spoke, and succeeded only, by making them unintelligible, in seeming interminable. His self-assurance was not like that of Cottard, freezing his patients, who, when other people praised his social graces, would reply: \u201cHe is a different man when he receives you in his consulting room, you with your face to the light, and he with his back to it, and those piercing eyes.\u201d It failed to create an effect, one felt that it was cloaking an excessive shyness, that the merest trifle would be enough to dispel it. Saniette, whose friends had always told him that he was wanting in self-confidence, and who had indeed seen men whom he rightly considered greatly inferior to himself, attain with ease to the success that was denied to him, never began telling a story without smiling at its drollery, fearing lest a serious air might make his hearers underestimate the value of his wares. Sometimes, giving him credit for the comic element which he himself appeared to find in what he was about to say, people would do him the honour of a general silence. But the story would fall flat. A fellow-guest who was endowed with a kind heart would sometimes convey to Saniette the private, almost secret encouragement of a smile of approbation, making it reach him furtively, without attracting attention, as one passes a note from hand to hand. But nobody went so far as to assume the responsibility, to risk the glaring publicity of an honest laugh. Long after the story was ended and had fallen flat, Saniette, crestfallen, would remain smiling to himself, as though relishing in it and for himself the delectation which he pretended to find adequate and which the others had not felt. As for the sculptor Ski, so styled on account of the difficulty they found in pronouncing his Polish surname, and because he himself made an affectation, since he had begun to move in a certain social sphere, of not wishing to be confused with certain relatives, perfectly respectable but slightly boring and very numerous, he had, at forty-four and with no pretension to good looks, a sort of boyishness, a dreamy wistfulness which was the result of his having been, until the age of ten, the most charming prodigal imaginable, the darling of all the ladies. Mme. Verdurin maintained that he was more of an artist than Elstir. Any resemblance that there may have been between them was, however, purely external. It was enough to make Elstir, who had met Ski once, feel for him the profound repulsion that is inspired in us less by the people who are our exact opposite than by those who r\u00e9semble us in what is least good, in whom are displayed our worst qualities, the faults of which we have cured ourselves, who irritate by reminding us of how we may have appeared to certain other people before we became what we now are. But Mme. Verdurin thought that Ski had more temperament than Elstir because there was no art in which he had not a facility of expression, and she was convinced that he would have developed that facility into talent if he had not been so lazy. This seemed to the Mistress to be actually an additional gift, being the opposite of hard work which she regarded as the lot of people devoid of genius. Ski would paint anything you asked, on cuff-links or on the panels over doors. He sang with the voice of a composer, played from memory, giving the piano the effect of an orchestra, less by his virtuosity than by his vamped basses, which suggested the inability of the fingers to indicate that at a certain point the cornet entered, which, for that matter, he would imitate with his lips. Choosing his words when he spoke so as to convey an odd impression, just as he would pause before banging out a chord to say \u2018Ping!\u2019 so as to let the brasses be heard, he was regarded as marvellously intelligent, but as a matter of fact his ideas could be boiled down to two or three, extremely limited. Bored with his reputation for whimsicality, he had set himself to shew that he was a practical, matter-of-fact person, whence a triumphant affectation of false precision, of false common sense, aggravated by his having no memory and a fund of information that was always inaccurate. The movements of his head, neck, limbs, would have been graceful if he had been still nine years old, with golden curls, a wide lace collar and little boots of red leather. Having reached Graincourt station with Cottard and Brichot, with time to spare, he and Cottard had left Brichot in the waiting-room and had gone for a stroll. When Cottard proposed to turn back, Ski had replied: \u201cBut there is no hurry. It isn\u2019t the local train to-day, it\u2019s the departmental train.\u201d Delighted by the effect that this refinement of accuracy produced upon Cottard, he added, with reference to himself: \u201cYes, because Ski loves the arts, because he models in clay, people think he\u2019s not practical. Nobody knows this line better than I do.\u201d Nevertheless they had turned back towards the station when, all of a sudden, catching sight of the smoke of the approaching train, Cottard, with a wild shout, had exclaimed: \u201cWe shall have to put our best foot foremost.\u201d They did as a matter of fact arrive with not a moment to spare, the distinction between local and departmental trains having never existed save in the mind of Ski. \u201cBut isn\u2019t the Princess on the train?\u201d came in ringing tones from Brichot, whose huge spectacles, resplendent as the reflectors that laryngologists attach to their foreheads to throw a light into the throats of their patients, seemed to have taken their life from the Professor\u2019s eyes, and possibly because of the effort that he was making to adjust his sight to them, seemed themselves, even at the most trivial moments, to be gazing at themselves with a sustained attention and an extraordinary fixity. Brichot\u2019s malady, as it gradually deprived him of his sight, had revealed to him the beauties of that sense, just as, frequently, we have to have made up our minds to part with some object, to make a present of it for instance, before we can study it, regret it, admire it. \u201cNo, no, the Princess went over to Maineville with some of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s guests who were taking the Paris train. It is within the bounds of possibility that Mme. Verdurin, who had some business at Saint-Mars, may be with her! In that case, she will be coming with us, and we shall all travel together, which will be delightful. We shall have to keep our eyes skinned at Maineville and see what we shall see! Oh, but that\u2019s nothing, you may say that we came very near to missing the bus. When I saw the train I was dumbfoundered. That\u2019s what is called arriving at the psychological moment. Can\u2019t you picture us missing the train, Mme. Verdurin seeing the carriages come back without us: Tableau!\u201d added the doctor, who had not yet recovered from his emotion. \u201cThat would be a pretty good joke, wouldn\u2019t it? Now then, Brichot, what have you to say about our little escapade?\u201d inquired the doctor with a note of pride. \u201cUpon my soul,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cwhy, yes, if you had found the train gone, that would have been what the late Villemain used to call a wipe in the eye!\u201d But I, distracted at first by these people who were strangers to me, was suddenly reminded of what Cottard had said to me in the ball-room of the little casino, and, just as though there were an invisible link uniting an organ to our visual memory, the vision of Albertine leaning her breasts against Andr\u00e9e\u2019s caused my heart a terrible pain. This pain did not last: the idea of Albertine\u2019s having relations with women seemed no longer possible since the occasion, forty-eight hours earlier, when the advances that my mistress had made to Saint-Loup had excited in me a fresh jealousy which had made me forget the old. I was simple enough to suppose that one taste of necessity excludes another. At Harambouville, as the tram was full, a farmer in a blue blouse who had only a third class ticket got into our compartment. The doctor, feeling that the Princess must not be allowed to travel with such a person, called a porter, shewed his card, describing him as medical officer to one of the big railway companies, and obliged the station-master to make the farmer get out. This incident so pained and alarmed Saniette\u2019s timid spirit that, as soon as he saw it beginning, fearing already lest, in view of the crowd of peasants on the platform, it should assume the proportions of a rising, he pretended to be suffering from a stomach-ache, and, so that he might not be accused of any share in the responsibility for the doctor\u2019s violence, wandered down the corridor, pretending to be looking for what Cottard called the \u2018water.\u2019 Failing to find one, he stood and gazed at the scenery from the other end of the \u2018twister.\u2019 \u201cIf this is your first appearance at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Sir,\u201d I was addressed by Brichot, anxious to shew off his talents before a newcomer, \u201cyou will find that there is no place where one feels more the \u2018amenities of life,\u2019 to quote one of the inventors of dilettantism, of pococurantism, of all sorts of words in \u2014 ism that are in fashion among our little snobbesses, I refer to M. le Prince de Talleyrand.\u201d For, when he spoke of these great noblemen of the past, he thought it clever and \u2018in the period\u2019 to prefix a \u2018M.\u2019 to their titles, and said \u2018M. le Duc de La Rochefoucauld,\u2019 \u2018M. le Cardinal de Retz,\u2019 referring to these also as \u2018That struggle-for-lifer de Gondi,\u2019 \u2018that Boulangist de Marcillac.\u2019 And he never failed to call Montesquieu, with a smile, when he referred to him: \u201cMonsieur le Pr\u00e9sident Second\u00e2t de Montesquieu.\u201d An intelligent man of the world would have been irritated by a pedantry which reeked so of the lecture-room. But in the perfect manners of the man of the world when speaking of a Prince, there is a pedantry also, which betrays a different caste, that in which one prefixes \u2018the Emperor\u2019 to the name \u2018William\u2019 and addresses a Royal Highness in the third person. \u201cAh, now that is a man,\u201d Brichot continued, still referring to \u2018Monsieur le Prince de Talleyrand\u2019\u2014\u201cto whom we take off our hats. He is an ancestor.\u201d \u201cIt is a charming house,\u201d Cottard told me, \u201cyou will find a little of everything, for Mme. Verdurin is not exclusive, great scholars like Brichot, the high nobility, such as the Princess Sherbatoff, a great Russian lady, a friend of the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, who even sees her alone at hours when no one else is admitted.\u201d As a matter of fact the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, not wishing Princess Sherbatoff, who for years past had been cut by everyone, to come to her house when there might be other people, allowed her to come only in the early morning, when Her Imperial Highness was not at home to any of those friends to whom it would have been as unpleasant to meet the Princess as it would have been awkward for the Princess to meet them. As, for the last three years, as soon as she came away, like a manicurist, from the Grand Duchess, Mme. Sherbatoff would go on to Mme. Verdurin, who had just awoken, and stuck to her for the rest of the day, one might say that the Princess\u2019s loyalty surpassed even that of Brichot, constant as he was at those Wednesdays, both in Paris, where he had the pleasure of fancying himself a sort of Chateaubriand at l\u2019Abbaye-aux-Bois, and in the country, where he saw himself becoming the equivalent of what might have been in the salon of Mme. de Ch\u00e2telet the man whom he always named (with an erudite sarcasm and satisfaction): \u201cM. de Voltaire.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her want of friends had enabled Princess Sherbatoff to shew for some years past to the Verdurins a fidelity which made her more than an ordinary member of the \u2018faithful,\u2019 the type of faithfulness, the ideal which Mme. Verdurin had long thought unattainable and which now, in her later years, she at length found incarnate in this new feminine recruit. However keenly the Mistress might feel the pangs of jealousy, it was without precedent that the most assiduous of her faithful should not have \u2018failed\u2019 her at least once. The most stay-at-home yielded to the temptation to travel; the most continent fell from virtue; the most robust might catch influenza, the idlest be caught for his month\u2019s soldiering, the most indifferent go to close the eyes of a dying mother. And it was in vain that Mme. Verdurin told them then, like the Roman Empress, that she was the sole general whom her legion must obey, like the Christ or the Kaiser that he who loved his father or mother more than her and was not prepared to leave them and follow her was not worthy of her, that instead of slacking in bed or letting themselves be made fools of by bad women they would do better to remain in her company, by her, their sole remedy and sole delight. But destiny which is sometimes pleased to brighten the closing years of a life that has passed the mortal span had made Mme. Verdurin meet the Princess Sherbatoff. Out of touch with her family, an exile from her native land, knowing nobody but the Baroness Putbus and the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, to whose houses, because she herself had no desire to meet the friends of the former, and the latter no desire that her friends should meet the Princess, she went only in the early morning hours when Mme. Verdurin was still asleep, never once, so far as she could remember, having been confined to her room since she was twelve years old, when she had had the measles, having on the 3lst of December replied to Mme. Verdurin who, afraid of being left alone, had asked her whether she would not \u2018shake down\u2019 there for the night, in spite of its being New Year\u2019s Eve: \u201cWhy, what is there to prevent me, any day of the year? Besides, to-morrow is a day when one stays at home, and this is my home,\u201d living in a boarding-house, and moving from it whenever the Verdurins moved, accompanying them upon their holidays, the Princess had so completely exemplified to Mme. Verdurin the line of Vigny:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thou only didst appear that which one seeks always\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the Lady President of the little circle, anxious to make sure of one of her \u2018faithful\u2019 even after death, had made her promise that whichever of them survived the other should be buried by her side. Before strangers \u2014 among whom we must always reckon him to whom we lie most barefacedly because he is the person whose scorn we should most dread: ourself \u2014 Princess Sherbatoff took care to represent her only three friendships \u2014 with the Grand Duchess, the Verdurins, and the Baroness Putbus \u2014 as the only ones, not which cataclysms beyond her control had allowed to emerge from the destruction of all the rest, but which a free choice had made her elect in preference to any other, and to which a certain love of solitude and simplicity had made her confine herself. \u201cI see nobody else,\u201d she would say, insisting upon the inflexible character of what appeared to be rather a rule that one imposes upon oneself than a necessity to which one submits. She would add: \u201cI visit only three houses,\u201d as a dramatist who fears that it may not run to a fourth announces that there will be only three performances of his play. Whether or not M. and Mme. Verdurin believed in the truth of this fiction, they had helped the Princess to instil it into the minds of the faithful. And they in turn were persuaded both that the Princess, among the thousands of invitations that were offered her, had chosen the Verdurins alone, and that the Verdurins, courted in vain by all the higher aristocracy, had consented to make but a single exception, in favour of the Princess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In their eyes, the Princess, too far superior to her native element not to find it boring, among all the people whose society she might have enjoyed, found the Verdurins alone entertaining, while they, in return, deaf to the overtures with which they were bombarded by the entire aristocracy, had consented to make but a single exception, in favour of a great lady of more intelligence than the rest of her kind, the Princess Sherbatoff\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Princess was very rich; she engaged for every first night a large box, to which, with the assent of Mme. Verdurin, she invited the faithful and nobody else. People would point to this pale and enigmatic person who had grown old without turning white, turning red rather like certain sere and shrivelled hedgerow fruits. They admired both her influence and her humility, for, having always with her an Academician, Brichot, a famous scientist, Cottard, the leading pianist of the day, at a later date M. de Charlus, she nevertheless made a point of securing the least prominent box in the theatre, remained in the background, paid no attention to the rest of the house, lived exclusively for the little group, who, shortly before the end of the performance, would withdraw in the wake of this strange sovereign, who was not without a certain timid, fascinating, faded beauty. But if Mme. Sherbatoff did not look at the audience, remained in shadow, it was to try to forget that there existed a living world which she passionately desired and was unable to know: the coterie in a box was to her what is to certain animals their almost corpselike immobility in the presence of danger. Nevertheless the thirst for novelty and for the curious which possesses people in society made them pay even more attention perhaps to this mysterious stranger than to the celebrities in the front boxes to whom everybody paid a visit. They imagined that she must be different from the people whom they knew, that a marvellous intellect combined with a discerning bounty retained round about her that little circle of eminent men. The Princess was compelled, if you spoke to her about anyone, or introduced anyone to her, to feign an intense coldness, in order to keep up the fiction of her horror of society. Nevertheless, with the support of Cottard or Mme. Verdurin, several newcomers succeeded in making her acquaintance and such was her excitement at making a fresh acquaintance that she forgot the fable of her deliberate isolation, and went to the wildest extremes to please the newcomer. If he was entirely unimportant, the rest would be astonished. \u201cHow strange that the Princess, who refuses to know anyone, should make an exception of such an uninteresting person.\u201d But these fertilising acquaintances were rare, and the Princess lived narrowly confined in the midst of the faithful\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cottard said far more often: \u201cI shall see him on Wednesday at the Verdurins\u2019,\u201d than: \u201cI shall see him on Tuesday at the Academy.\u201d He spoke, too, of the Wednesdays as of an engagement equally important and inevitable. But Cottard was one of those people, little sought after, who make it as imperious a duty to respond to an invitation as if such invitations were orders, like a military or judicial summons. It required a call from a very important patient to make him \u201cfail\u201d the Verdurins on a Wednesday, the importance depending moreover rather upon the rank of the patient than upon the gravity of his complaint. For Cottard, excellent fellow as he was, would forego the delights of a Wednesday not for a workman who had had a stroke, but for a Minister\u2019s cold. Even then he would say to his wife: \u201cMake my apologies to Mme. Verdurin. Tell her that I shall be coming later on. His Excellency might really have chosen some other day to catch cold.\u201d One Wednesday their old cook having opened a vein in her arm, Cottard, already in his dinner-jacket to go to the Verdurins\u2019, had shrugged his shoulders when his wife had timidly inquired whether he could not bandage the cut: \u201cOf course I can\u2019t, L\u00e9ontine,\u201d he had groaned; \u201ccan\u2019t you see I\u2019ve got my white waistcoat on?\u201d So as not to annoy her husband, Mme. Cottard had sent post haste for his chief dresser. He, to save time, had taken a cab, with the result that, his carriage entering the courtyard just as Cottard\u2019s was emerging to take him to the Verdurins\u2019, five minutes had been wasted in backing to let one another pass. Mme. Cottard was worried that the dresser should see his master in evening dress. Cottard sat cursing the delay, from remorse perhaps, and started off in a villainous temper which it took all the Wednesday\u2019s pleasures to dispel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If one of Cottard\u2019s patients were to ask him: \u201cDo you ever see the Guermantes?\u201d it was with the utmost sincerity that the Professor would reply: \u201cPerhaps not actually the Guermantes, I can\u2019t be certain. But I meet all those people at the house of some friends of mine. You must, of course, have heard of the Verdurins. They know everybody. Besides, they certainly are not people who\u2019ve come down in the world. They\u2019ve got the goods, all right. It is generally estimated that Mme. Verdurin is worth thirty-five million. Gad, thirty-five million, that\u2019s a pretty figure. And so she doesn\u2019t make two bites at a cherry. You mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes. Let me explain the difference. Mme. Verdurin is a great lady, the Duchesse de Guermantes is probably a nobody. You see the distinction, of course. In any case, whether the Guermantes go to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s or not, she entertains all the very best people, the d\u2019Sherbat\u00f4ffs, the d\u2019Forchevilles, e tutti quanti, people of the highest flight, all the nobility of France and Navarre, with whom you would see me conversing as man to man. Of course, those sort of people are only too glad to meet the princes of science,\u201d he added, with a smile of fatuous conceit, brought to his lips by his proud satisfaction not so much that the expression formerly reserved for men like Potain and Charcot should now be applicable to himself, as that he knew at last how to employ all these expressions that were authorised by custom, and, after a long course of study, had learned them by heart. And so, after mentioning to me Princess Sherbatoff as one of the people who went to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Cottard added with a wink: \u201cThat gives you an idea of the style of the house, if you see what I mean?\u201d He meant that it was the very height of fashion. Now, to entertain a Russian lady who knew nobody but the Grand Duchess Eudoxie was not fashionable at all. But Princess Sherbatoff might not have known even her, it would in no way have diminished Cottard\u2019s estimate of the supreme elegance of the Verdurin salon or his joy at being invited there. The splendour that seems to us to invest the people whose houses we visit is no more intrinsic than that of kings and queens on the stage, in dressing whom it is useless for a producer to spend hundreds and thousands of francs in purchasing authentic costumes and real jewels, when a great designer will procure a far more sumptuous impression by focussing a ray of light on a doublet of coarse cloth studded with lumps of glass and on a cloak of paper. A man may have spent his life among the great ones of the earth, who to him have been merely boring relatives or tiresome acquaintances, because a familiarity engendered in the cradle had stripped them of all distinction in his eyes. The same man, on the other hand, need only have been led by some chance to mix with the most obscure people, for innumerable Cottards to be permanently dazzled by the ladies of title whose drawing-rooms they imagined as the centres of aristocratic elegance, ladies who were not even what Mme. de Villeparisis and her friends were (great ladies fallen from their greatness, whom the aristocracy that had been brought up with them no longer visited); no, those whose friendship has been the pride of so many men, if these men were to publish their memoirs and to give the names of those women and of the other women who came to their parties, Mme. de Cambremer would be no more able than Mme. de Guermantes to identify them. But what of that! A Cottard has thus his Marquise, who is to him \u201cthe Baronne,\u201d as in Marivaux, the Baronne whose name is never mentioned, so much so that nobody supposes that she ever had a name. Cottard is all the more convinced that she embodies the aristocracy \u2014 which has never heard of the lady \u2014 in that, the more dubious titles are, the more prominently coronets are displayed upon wineglasses, silver, notepaper, luggage. Many Cottards who have supposed that they were living in the heart of the Faubourg Saint-Germain have had their imagination perhaps more enchanted by feudal dreams than the men who did really live among Princes, just as with the small shopkeeper who, on Sundays, goes sometimes to look at \u201cold time\u201d buildings, it is sometimes from those buildings every stone of which is of our own time, the vaults of which have been, by the pupils of Viollet-le-Duc, painted blue and sprinkled with golden stars, that they derive the strongest sensation of the middle ages. \u201cThe Princess will be at Maineville. She will be coming with us. But I shall not introduce you to her at once. It will be better to leave that to Mme. Verdurin. Unless I find a loophole. Then you can rely on me to take the bull by the horns.\u201d \u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d asked Saniette, as he rejoined us, pretending to have gone out to take the air. \u201cI was quoting to this gentleman,\u201d said Brichot, \u201ca saying, which you will remember, of the man who, to my mind, is the first of the fins-de-si\u00e8cle (of the eighteenth century, that is), by name Charles Maurice, Abb\u00e9 de Perigord. He began by promising to be an excellent journalist. But he made a bad end, by which I mean that he became a Minister! Life has these tragedies. A far from serapulous politician to boot who, with the lofty contempt of a thoroughbred nobleman, did not hesitate to work in his time for the King of Prussia, there are no two ways about it, and died in the skin of a \u2018Left Centre.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Saint-Pierre-des-Ifs we were joined by a glorious girl who, unfortunately, was not one of the little group. I could not tear my eyes from her magnolia skin, her dark eyes, her bold and admirable outlines. A moment later she wanted to open a window, for it was hot in the compartment, and not wishing to ask leave of everybody, as I alone was without a greatcoat, she said to me in a quick, cool, jocular voice: \u201cDo you mind a little fresh air, Sir?\u201d I would have liked to say to her: \u201cCome with us to the Verdurins\u2019?\u201d or \u201cGive me your name and address.\u201d I answered: \u201cNo, fresh air doesn\u2019t bother me, Mademoiselle.\u201d Whereupon, without stirring from her seat: \u201cDo your friends object to smoke?\u201d and she lit a cigarette. At the third station she sprang from the carriage. Next day, I inquired of Albertine, who could she be. For, stupidly thinking that people could have but one sort of love, in my jealousy of Albertine\u2019s attitude towards Robert, I was reassured so far as other women were concerned. Albertine told me, I believe quite sincerely, that she did not know. \u201cI should so much like to see her again,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, one always sees people again,\u201d replied Albertine. In this particular instance, she was wrong; I never saw again, nor did I ever identify, the pretty girl with the cigarette. We shall see, moreover, why, for a long time, I ceased to look for her. But I have not forgotten her. I find myself at times, when I think of her, seized by a wild longing. But these recurrences of desire oblige us to reflect that if we wish to rediscover these girls with the same pleasure we must also return to the year which has since been followed by ten others in the course of which her bloom has faded. We can sometimes find a person again, but we cannot abolish time. And so on until the unforeseen day, gloomy as a winter night, when we no longer seek for that girl, or for any other, when to find her would actually frighten us. For we no longer feel that we have sufficient attraction to appeal to her, or strength to love her. Not, of course, that we are, in the strict sense of the word, impotent. And as for loving, we should love her more than ever. But we feel that it is too big an undertaking for the little strength that we have left. Eternal rest has already fixed intervals which we can neither cross nor make our voice be heard across them. To set our foot on the right step is an achievement like not missing the perilous leap. To be seen in such a state by a girl we love, even if we have kept the features and all the golden locks of our youth! We can no longer undertake the strain of keeping pace with youth. All the worse if our carnal desire increases instead of failing! We procure for it a woman whom we need make no effort to attract, who will share our couch for one night only and whom we shall never see again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStill no news, I suppose, of the violinist,\u201d said Cottard. The event of the day in the little clan was, in fact, the failure of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s favourite violinist. Employed on military service near Donci\u00e8res, he came three times a week to dine at la Raspeli\u00e8re, having a midnight pass. But two days ago, for the first time, the faithful had been unable to discover him on the tram. It was supposed that he had missed it. But albeit Mme. Verdurin had sent to meet the next tram, and so on until the last had arrived, the carriage had returned empty. \u201cHe\u2019s certain to have been shoved into the guard-room, there\u2019s no other explanation of his desertion. Gad! In soldiering, you know, with those fellows, it only needs a bad-tempered serjeant.\u201d \u201cIt will be all the more mortifying for Mme. Verdurin,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cif he fails again this evening, because our kind hostess has invited to dinner for the first time the neighbours from whom she has taken la Raspeli\u00e8re, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer.\u201d \u201cThis evening, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer!\u201d exclaimed Cottard. \u201cBut I knew absolutely nothing about it. Naturally, I knew like everybody else that they would be coming one day, but I had no idea that it was to be so soon. Sapristi!\u201d he went on, turning to myself, \u201cwhat did I tell you? The Princess Sherbatoff, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer.\u201d And, after repeating these names, lulling himself with their melody: \u201cYou see that we move in good company,\u201d he said to me. \u201cHowever, as it\u2019s your first appearance, you\u2019ll be one of the crowd. It is going to be an exceptionally brilliant gathering.\u201d And, turning to Brichot, he went on: \u201cThe Mistress will be furious. It is time we appeared to lend her a hand.\u201d Ever since Mme. Verdurin had been at la Raspeli\u00e8re she had pretended for the benefit of the faithful to be at once feeling and regretting the necessity of inviting her landlords for one evening. By so doing she would obtain better terms next year, she explained, and was inviting them for business reasons only. But she pretended to regard with such terror, to make such a bugbear of the idea of dining with people who did not belong to the little group that she kept putting off the evil day. The prospect did for that matter alarm her slightly for the reasons which she professed, albeit exaggerating them, if at the same time it enchanted her for reasons of snobbishness which she preferred to keep to herself. She was therefore partly sincere, she believed the little clan to be something so matchless throughout the world, one of those perfect wholes which it takes centuries of time to produce, that she trembled at the thought of seeing introduced into its midst these provincials, people ignorant of the Ring and the Meistersinger, who would be unable to play their part in the concert of conversation and were capable, by coming to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, of ruining one of those famous Wednesdays, masterpieces of art incomparable and frail, like those Venetian glasses which one false note is enough to shatter. \u201cBesides, they are bound to be absolutely anti, and militarists,\u201d M. Verdurin had said. \u201cOh, as for that, I don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ve heard quite enough about all that business,\u201d had replied Mme. Verdurin, who, a sincere Dreyfusard, would nevertheless have been glad to discover a social counterpoise to the preponderant Dreyfusism of her salon. For Dreyfusism was triumphant politically, but not socially. Labori, Reinach, Picquart, Zola were still, to people in society, more or less traitors, who could only keep them aloof from the little nucleus. And so, after this incursion into politics, Mme. Verdurin was determined to return to the world of art. Besides were not Indy, Debussy, on the \u2018wrong\u2019 side in the Case? \u201cSo far as the Case goes, we need only remember Brichot,\u201d she said (the Don being the only one of the faithful who had sided with the General Staff, which had greatly lowered him in the esteem of Madame Verdurin). \u201cThere is no need to be eternally discussing the Dreyfus case. No, the fact of the matter is that the Cambremers bore me.\u201d As for the faithful, no less excited by their unconfessed desire to make the Cambremers\u2019 acquaintance than dupes of the affected reluctance which Mme. Verdurin said she felt to invite them, they returned, day after day, in conversation with her, to the base arguments with which she herself supported the invitation, tried to make them irresistible. \u201cMake up your mind to it once and for all,\u201d Cottard repeated, \u201cand you will have better terms for next year, they will pay the gardener, you will have the use of the meadow. That will be well worth a boring evening. I am thinking only of yourselves,\u201d he added, albeit his heart had leaped on one occasion, when, in Mme. Verdurin\u2019s carriage, he had met the carriage of the old Mme. de Cambremer and, what was more, he had been abased in the sight of the railwaymen when, at the station, he had found himself standing beside the Marquis. For their part, the Cambremers, living far too remote from the social movement ever to suspect that certain ladies of fashion were speaking with a certain consideration of Mme. Verdurin, imagined that she was a person who could know none but Bohemians, was perhaps not even legally married, and so far as people of birth were concerned would never meet any but themselves. They had resigned themselves to the thought of dining with her only to be on good terms with a tenant who, they hoped, would return again for many seasons, especially after they had, in the previous month, learned that she had recently inherited all those millions. It was in silence and without any vulgar pleasantries that they prepared themselves for the fatal day. The faithful had given up hope of its ever coming, so often had Mme. Verdurin already fixed in their hearing a date that was invariably postponed. These false decisions were intended not merely to make a display of the boredom that she felt at the thought of this dinner-party, but to keep in suspense those members of the little group who were staying in the neighbourhood and were sometimes inclined to fail. Not that the Mistress guessed that the \u201cgreat day\u201d was as delightful a prospect to them as to herself, but in order that, having persuaded them that this dinner-party was to her the most terrible of social duties, she might make an appeal to their devotion. \u201cYou are not going to leave me all alone with those Chinese mandarins! We must assemble in full force to support the boredom. Naturally, we shan\u2019t be able to talk about any of the things in which we are interested. It will be a Wednesday spoiled, but what is one to do!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed,\u201d Brichot explained to me, \u201cI fancy that Mme. Verdurin, who is highly intelligent and takes infinite pains in the elaboration of her Wednesdays, was by no means anxious to see these bumpkins of ancient lineage but scanty brains. She could not bring herself to invite the dowager Marquise, but has resigned herself to having the son and daughter-in-law.\u201d \u201cAh! We are to see the Marquise de Cambremer?\u201d said Cottard with a smile into which he saw fit to introduce a leer of sentimentality, albeit he had no idea whether Mme. de Cambremer were good-looking or not. But the title Marquise suggested to him fantastic thoughts of gallantry. \u201cAh! I know her,\u201d said Ski, who had met her once when he was out with Mme. Verdurin. \u201cNot in the biblical sense of the word, I trust,\u201d said the doctor, darting a sly glance through his eyeglass; this was one of his favourite pleasantries. \u201cShe is intelligent,\u201d Ski informed me. \u201cNaturally,\u201d he went on, seeing that I said nothing, and dwelling with a smile upon each word, \u201cshe is intelligent and at the same time she is not, she lacks education, she is frivolous, but she has an instinct for beautiful things. She may say nothing, but she will never say anything silly. And besides, her colouring is charming. She would be an amusing person to paint,\u201d he added, half shutting his eyes, as though he saw her posing in front of him. As my opinion of her was quite the opposite of what Ski was expressing with so many fine shades, I observed merely that she was the sister of an extremely distinguished engineer, M. Legrandin. \u201cThere, you see, you are going to be introduced to a pretty woman,\u201d Brichot said to me, \u201cand one never knows what may come of that. Cleopatra was not even a great lady, she was a little woman, the unconscious, terrible little woman of our Meilhac, and just think of the consequences, not only to that idiot Antony, but to the whole of the ancient world.\u201d \u201cI have already been introduced to Mme. de Cambremer,\u201d I replied. \u201cAh! In that case, you will find yourself on familiar ground.\u201d \u201cI shall be all the more delighted to meet her,\u201d I answered him, \u201cbecause she has promised me a book by the former cur\u00e9 of Com-bray about the place-names of this district, and I shall be able to remind her of her promise. I am interested in that priest, and also in etymologies.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t put any faith in the ones he gives,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cthere is a copy of the book at la Raspeli\u00e8re, which I have glanced through, but without finding anything of any value; it is a mass of error. Let me give you an example. The word Bricq is found in a number of place-names in this neighbourhood. The worthy cleric had the distinctly odd idea that it comes from Briga, a height, a fortified place. He finds it already in the Celtic tribes, Latobriges, Nemetobriges, and so forth, and traces it down to such names as Briand, Brion, and so forth. To confine ourselves to the region in which we have the pleasure of your company at this moment, Bricquebose means the wood on the height, Bricqueville the habitation on the height, Bricquebec, where we shall be stopping presently before coming to Maineville, the height by the stream. Now there is not a word of truth in all this, for the simple reason that bricq is the old Norse word which means simply a bridge. Just as fleur, which Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 takes infinite pains to connect, in one place with the Scandinavian words floi, flo, in another with the Irish word ae or aer, is, beyond any doubt, the fjord of the Danes, and means harbour. So too, the excellent priest thinks that the station of Saint-Mars-le-Vetu, which adjoins la Raspeli\u00e8re, means Saint-Martin-le-Vieux (vetus). It is unquestionable that the word vieux has played a great part in the toponymy of this region. Vieux comes as a rule from vadum, and means a passage, as at the place called les Vieux. It is what the English call ford (Oxford, Hereford). But, in this particular instance, V\u00eatu is derived not from vetus, but from vas-tatus, a place that is devastated and bare. You have, round about here, Sottevast, the vast of Setold, Brillevast, the vast of Berold. I am all the more certain of the cure\u2019s mistake, in that Saint-Mars-le-Vetu was formerly called Saint-Mars du Cast and even Saint-Mars-de-Terregate. Now the v and the g in these words are the same letter. We say d\u00e9vaster, but also g\u00e2cher. J\u00e2ch\u00e8res andgatines (from the High German wastinna) have the same meaning: Terregate is therefore terra vasta. As for Saint-Mars, formerly (save the mark) Saint-Merd, it is Saint-Medardus, which appears variously as Saint-M\u00e9dard, Saint-Mard, Saint-Marc, Cinq-Mars, and even Dammas. Nor must we forget that quite close to here, places bearing the name of Mars are proof simply of a pagan origin (the god Mars) which has remained alive in this country but which the holy man refuses to see. The high places dedicated to the gods are especially frequent, such as the mount of Jupiter (Jeumont). Your cur\u00e9 declines to admit this, but, on the other hand, wherever Christianity has left traces, they escape his notice. He has gone so far afield as to Loctudy, a barbarian name, according to him, whereas it is simply Locus Sancti Tudeni, nor has he in Sammarcoles divined Sanctus Martialis. Your cur\u00e9,\u201d Brichot continued, seeing that I was interested, \u201cderives the terminations hon, home, holm, from the word holl (hullus), a hill, whereas it cornes from the Norse holm, an island, with which you are familiar in Stockholm, and which is so widespread throughout this district, la Houlme, Engohomme, Tahoume, Robehomme, N\u00e9homme, Quettehon, and so forth.\u201d These names made me think of the day when Albertine had wished to go to Amfreville-la-Bigot (from the name of two successive lords of the manor, Brichot told me), and had then suggested that we should dine together at Robehomme. As for Maineville, we were just coming to it. \u201cIsn\u2019t N\u00e9homme,\u201d I asked, \u201csomewhere near Carquethuit and Clitourps?\u201d \u201cPrecisely; N\u00e9homme is the holm, the island or peninsula of the famous Viscount Nigel, whose name has survived also in Neville. The Carquethuit and Clitourps that you mention furnish Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 with an occasion for further blunders. No doubt he has seen that carque is a church, the Kirche of the Germans. You will remember Querqueville, not to mention Dun-kerque. For there we should do better to stop and consider the famous word Dun, which to the Celts meant high ground. And that you will find over the whole of France. Your abb\u00e9 was hypnotised by Duneville, which recurs in the Eure-et-Loir; he would have found Ch\u00e2teaudun, Dun-le-Roi in the Cher, Duneau in the Sarthe, Dun in the Ari\u00e8ge, Dune-les-Places in the Ni\u00e8vre, and many others. This word Dun leads him into a curious error with regard to Douville where we shall be alighting, and shall find Mme. Verdurin\u2019s comfortable carriages awaiting us. Douville, in Latin donvilla, says he. As a matter of fact, Douville does lie at the foot of high hills. Your cur\u00e9, who knows everything, feels all the same that he has made a blunder. He has, indeed, found in an old cartulary, the name Domvilla. Whereupon he retracts; Douville, according to him, is a fief belonging to the Abbot, Domino Abbati, of Mont Saint-Michel. He is delighted with the discovery, which is distinctly odd when one thinks of the scandalous life that, according to the Capitulary of Sainte-Claire sur Epte, was led at Mont Saint-Michel, though no more extraordinary than to picture the King of Denmark as suzerain of all this coast, where he encouraged the worship of Odin far more than that of Christ. On the other hand, the supposition that the n has been changed to m does not shock me, and requires less alteration than the perfectly correct Lyon, which also is derived from Dun (Lugdunum). But the fact is, the abb\u00e9 is mistaken. Douville was never Donville, but Doville, Eudonis villa, the village of Eudes. Douville was formerly called Escalecliff, the steps up the cliff. About the year 1233, Eudes le Bouteiller, Lord of Escalecliff, set out for the Holy Land; on the eve of his departure he made over the church to the Abbey of Blanche-lande. By an exchange of courtesies, the village took his name, whence we have Douville to-day. But I must add that toponymy, of which moreover I know little or nothing, is not an exact science; had we not this historical evidence, Douville might quite well come from Ouville, that is to say the Waters. The forms in ai (Aigu\u00ebs-Mortes), from aqua, are constantly changed to eu or ou. Now there were, quite close to Douville, certain famous springs, Carquethuit. You might suppose that the cur\u00e9 was only too ready to detect there a Christian origin, especially as this district seems to have been pretty hard to convert, since successive attempts were made by Saint Ursal, Saint Gofroi, Saint Barsanore, Saint Laurent of Br\u00e8vedent, who finally handed over the task to the monks of Beaubec. But as regards thuit the writer is mistaken, he sees in it a form of toft, a building, as in Cricquetot, Ectot, Yvetot, whereas it is the thveit, the clearing, the reclaimed land, as in Braquetuit, le Thuit, Regnetuit, and so forth. Similarly, if he recognises in Clitourps the Norman thorp which means village, he insists that the first syllable of the word must come fromclivus, a slope, whereas it comes from cliff, a precipice. But his biggest blunders are due not so much to his ignorance as to his prejudices. However loyal a Frenchman one is, there is no need to fly in the face of the evidence and take Saint-Laurent en Bray to be the Roman priest, so famous at one time, when he is actually Saint Lawrence \u2018Toot, Archbishop of Dublin. But even more than his patriotic sentiments, your friend\u2019s religious bigotry leads him into strange errors. Thus you have not far from our hosts at la Raspeli\u00e8re two places called Montmartin, Montmartin-sur-Mer and Mont-martin-en-Graignes. In the case of Craignes, the good cur\u00e9 has been quite right, he has seen that Craignes, in Latin Crania, in GreekKrene, means ponds, marshes; how many instances of Cresmays, Croen, Gremeville, Lengronne, might we not adduce? But, when he comes to Montmartin, your self-styled linguist positively insists that these must be parishes dedicated to Saint Martin. He bases his opinion upon the fact that the Saint is their patron, but does not realise that he was only adopted subsequently; or rather he is blinded by his hatred of paganism; he refuses to see that we should say Mont-Saint-Martin as we say Mont-Saint-Michel, if it were a question of Saint Martin, whereas the name Montmartin refers in a far more pagan fashion to temples consecrated to the god Mars, temples of which, it is true, no other vestige remains, but which the undisputed existence in the neighbourhood of vast Roman camps would render highly probable even without the name Montmartin, which removes all doubt. You see that the little pamphlet which you will find at la Raspeli\u00e8re is far from perfect.\u201d I protested that at Combray the cur\u00e9 had often told us interesting etymologies. \u201cHe was probably better on his own ground, the move to Normandy must have made him lose his bearings.\u201d \u201cNor did it do him any good,\u201d I added, \u201cfor he came here with neurasthenia and went away again with rheumatism.\u201d \u201cAh, his neurasthenia is to blame. He has lapsed from neurasthenia to philology, as my worthy master Pocquelin would have said. Tell us, Cottard, do you suppose that neurasthenia can have a disturbing effect on philology, philology a soothing effect on neurasthenia and the relief from neurasthenia lead to rheumatism?\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly, rheumatism and neurasthenia are subordinate forms of neuro-arthritism. You may pass from one to the other by metastasis.\u201d \u201cThe eminent Professor,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cexpresses himself in a French as highly infused with Latin and Greek as M. Purgon himself, of Moli\u00e8resque memory! My uncle, I refer to our national Sarcey. . . . \u201d But he was prevented from finishing his sentence. The Professor had leaped from his seat with a wild shout: \u201cThe devil!\u201d he exclaimed on regaining his power of articulate speech, \u201cwe have passed Maineville (d\u2019you hear?) and Renneville too.\u201d He had just noticed that the train was stopping at Saint-Mars-le-Vetu, where most of the passengers alighted. \u201cThey can\u2019t have run through without stopping. We must have failed to notice it while we were talking about the Cambremers. Listen to me, Ski, pay attention, I am going to tell you \u2018a good one,\u2019\u201d said Cottard, who had taken a fancy to this expression, in common use in certain medical circles. \u201cThe Princess must be on the train, she can\u2019t have seen us, and will have got into another compartment. Come along and find her. Let\u2019s hope this won\u2019t land us in trouble!\u201d And he led us all off in search of Princess Sherbatoff. He found her in the corner of an empty compartment, reading the Revue des Deux Mondes. She had long ago, from fear of rebuffs, acquired the habit of keeping in her place, or remaining in her corner, in life as on the train, and of not offering her hand until the other person had greeted her. She went on reading as the faithful trooped into her carriage. I recognised her immediately; this woman who might have forfeited her position but was nevertheless of exalted birth, who in any event was the pearl of a salon such as the Verdurins\u2019, was the lady whom, on the same train, I had put down, two days earlier, as possibly the keeper of a brothel. Her social personality, which had been so vague, became clear to me as soon as I learned her name, just as when, after racking our brains over a puzzle, we at length hit upon the word which clears up all the obscurity, and which, in the case of a person, is his name. To discover two days later who the person is with whom one has travelled in the train is a far more amusing surprise than to read in the next number of a magazine the clue to the problem set in the previous number. Big restaurants, casinos, local trains, are the family portrait galleries of these social enigmas. \u201cPrincess, we must have missed you at Maineville! May we come and sit in your compartment?\u201d \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d said the Princess who, upon hearing Cottard address her, but only then, raised from her magazine a pair of eyes which, like the eyes of M. de Charlus, although gentler, saw perfectly well the people of whose presence she pretended to be unaware. Cottard, coming to the conclusion that the fact of my having been invited to meet the Cambremers was a sufficient recommendation, decided, after a momentary hesitation, to intro-duce me to the Princess, who bowed with great courtesy but appeared to be hearing my name for the first time. \u201cCr\u00e9 nom!\u201d cried the doctor, \u201cmy wife has forgotten to make them change the buttons on my white waist-coat. Ah! Those women, they never remember anything. Don\u2019t you ever marry, my boy,\u201d he said to me. And as this was one of the pleasantries which he considered appropriate when he had nothing else to say, he peeped out of the corner of his eye at the Princess and the rest of the faithful, who, because he was a Professor and an Academician, smiled back, admiring his good temper and freedom from pride. The Princess informed us that the young violinist had been found. He had been confined to bed the evening before by a sick headache, but was coming that evening and bringing with him a friend of his father whom he had met at Donci\u00e8res. She had learned this from Mme. Verdurin with whom she had taken luncheon that morning, she told us in a rapid voice, rolling her r_s, with her Russian accent, softly at the back of her throat, as though they were not r_s but l_s. \u201cAh! You had luncheon with her this morning,\u201d Cottard said to the Princess; but turned his eyes to myself, the purport of this remark being to shew me on what intimate terms the Princess was with the Mistress. \u201cYou are indeed a faithful adherent!\u201d \u201cYes, I love the little cirlcle, so intelligent, so agleeable, neverl spiteful, quite simple, not at all snobbish, and clevel to theirl fingle-tips.\u201d \u201cNom d\u2019une pipe! I must have lost my ticket, I can\u2019t find it anywhere,\u201d cried Cottard, with an agitation that was, in the circumstances, quite unjustified. He knew that at Douville, where a couple of landaus would be awaiting us, the collector would let him pass without a ticket, and would only bare his head all the more humbly, so that the salute might furnish an explanation of his indulgence, to wit that he had of course recognised Cottard as one of the Verdurins\u2019 regular guests. \u201cThey won\u2019t shove me in the lock-up for that,\u201d the doctor concluded. \u201cYou were saying, Sir,\u201d I inquired of Brichot, \u201cthat there used to be some famous waters near here; how do we know that?\u201d \u201cThe name of the next station is one of a multitude of proofs. It is called Fervaches.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t undlestand what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d mumbled the Princess, as though she were saying to me out of politeness: \u201cHe\u2019s rather a bore, ain\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cWhy, Princess, Fervaches means hot springs. Fervidae aquae. But to return to the young violinist,\u201d Brichot went on, \u201cI was quite forgetting, Cottard, to tell you the great news. Had you heard that our poor friend Dechambre, who used to be Mme. Verdurin\u2019s favourite pianist, has just died? It is terribly sad.\u201d \u201cHe was quite young,\u201d replied Cottard, \u201cbut he must have had some trouble with his liver, there must have been something sadly wrong in that quarter, he had been looking very queer indeed for a long time past.\u201d \u201cBut he was not so young as all that,\u201d said Brichot; \u201cin the days when Elstir and Swann used to come to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Dechambre had already made himself a reputation in Paris, and, what is remarkable, without having first received the baptism of success abroad. Ah! He was no follower of the Gospel according to Saint Barnum, that fellow.\u201d \u201cYou are mistaken, he could not have been going to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, at that time, he was still in the nursery.\u201d \u201cBut, unless my old memory plays me false, I was under the impression that Dechambre used to play Vinteuil\u2019s sonata for Swann, when that clubman, who had broken with the aristocracy, had still no idea that he was one day to become the embourgeoised Prince Consort of our national Odette.\u201d \u201cIt is impossible, Vinteuil\u2019s sonata was played at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s long after Swann ceased to come there,\u201d said the doctor, who, like all people who work hard and think that they remember many things which they imagine to be of use to them, forget many others, a condition which enables them to go into ecstasies over the memories of people who have nothing else to do. \u201cYou are hopelessly muddled, though your brain is as sound as ever,\u201d said the doctor with a smile. Brichot admitted that he was mistaken. The train stopped. We were at la Sogne. The name stirred my curiosity. \u201cHow I should like to know what all these names mean,\u201d I said to Cottard. \u201cYou must ask M. Brichot, he may know, perhaps.\u201d \u201cWhy, la Sogne is la Cicogne, Siconia,\u201d replied Brichot, whom I was burning to interrogate about many other names\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forgetting her attachment to her \u2018corner,\u2019 Mme. Sherbatoff kindly offered to change places with me, so that I might talk more easily with Brichot, whom I wanted to ask about other etymologies that interested me, and assured me that she did not mind in the least whether she travelled with her face or her back to the engine, standing, or seated, or anyhow. She remained on the defensive until she had discovered a newcomer\u2019s intentions, but as soon as she had realised that these were friendly, she would do everything in her power to oblige. At length the train stopped at the station of Douville-F\u00e9terne, which being more or less equidistant from the villages of F\u00e9terne and Douville, bore for this reason their hyphenated name. \u201cSaperlipopette!\u201d exclaimed Doctor Cottard, when we came to the barrier where the tickets were collected, and, pretending to have only just discovered his loss, \u201cI can\u2019t find my ticket, I must have lost it.\u201d But the collector, taking off his cap, assured him that it did not matter and smiled respectfully. The Princess (giving instructions to the coachman, as though she were a sort of lady in waiting to Mme. Verdurin, who, because of the Cambremers, had not been able to come to the station, as, for that matter, she rarely did) took me, and also Brichot, with herself in one of the carriages. The doctor, Saniette and Ski got into the other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The driver, although quite young, was the Verdurins\u2019 first coachman, the only one who had any right to the title; he took them, in the daytime, on all their excursions, for he knew all the roads, and in the evening went down to meet the faithful and took them back to the station later on. He was accompanied by extra helpers (whom he selected if necessary). He was an excellent fellow, sober and capable, but with one of those melancholy faces on which a fixed stare indicates that the merest trifle will make the person fly into a passion, not to say nourish dark thoughts. But at the moment he was quite happy, for he had managed to secure a place for his brother, another excellent type of fellow, with the Verdurins. We began by driving through Douville. Grassy knolls ran down from the village to the sea, in wide slopes to which their saturation in moisture and salt gave a richness, a softness, a vivacity of extreme tones. The islands and indentations of Rivebelle, far nearer now than at Balbec, gave this part of the coast the appearance, novel to me, of a relief map. We passed by some little bungalows, almost all of which were let to painters; turned into a track upon which some loose cattle, as frightened as were our horses, barred our way for ten minutes, and emerged upon the cliff road. \u201cBut, by the immortal gods,\u201d Brichot suddenly asked, \u201clet us return to that poor Dechambre; do you suppose Mme. Verdurin knows? Has anyone toldher?\u201d Mme. Verdurin, like most people who move in society, simply because she needed the society of other people, never thought of them again for a single day, as soon as, being dead, they could no longer come to the Wednesdays, nor to the Saturdays, nor dine without dressing. And one could not say of the little clan, a type in this respect of all salons, that it was composed of more dead than living members, seeing that, as soon as one was dead, it was as though one had never existed. But, to escape the nuisance of having to speak of the deceased, in other words to postpone one of the dinners \u2014 a thing impossible to the mistress \u2014 as a token of mourning, M. Verdurin used to pretend that the death of the faithful had such an effect on his wife that, in the interest of her health, it must never be mentioned to her. Moreover, and perhaps just because the death of other people seemed to him so conclusive, so vulgar an accident, the thought of his own death filled him with horror and he shunned any consideration that might lead to it. As for Brichot, since he was the soul of honesty and completely taken in by what M. Verdurin said about his wife, he dreaded for his friend\u2019s sake the emotions that such a bereavement must cause her. \u201cYes, she knew the worst this morning,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cit was impossible to keep it from her.\u201d \u201cAh! Thousand thunders of Zeus!\u201d cried Brichot. \u201cAh! it must have been a terrible blow, a friend of twenty-five years\u2019 standing. There was a man who was one of us.\u201d \u201cOf course, of course, what can you expect? Such incidents are bound to be painful; but Madame Verdurin is a brave woman, she is even more cerebral than emotive.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t altogether agree with the Doctor,\u201d said the Princess, whose rapid speech, her murmured accents, certainly made her appear both sullen and rebellious. \u201cMme. Verdurin, beneath a cold exterior, conceals treasures of sensibility. M. Verdurin told me that he had had great difficulty in preventing her from going to Paris for the funeral; he was obliged to let her think that it was all to be held in the country.\u201d \u201cThe devil! She wanted to go to Paris, did she? Of course, I know that she has a heart, too much heart perhaps. Poor Dechambre! As Madame Verdurin remarked not two months ago: \u2018Compared with him, Plant\u00e9, Paderewski, Risler himself are nowhere!\u2019 Ah, he could say with better reason than that limelighter Nero, who has managed to take in even German scholarship:Qualis artifex pereo! But he at least, Dechambre, must have died in the fulfilment of his priesthood, in the odour of Beethovenian devotion; and gallantly, I have no doubt; he had every right, that interpreter of German music, to pass away while celebrating the Mass in D. But he was, when all is said, the man to greet the unseen with a cheer, for that inspired performer would produce at times from the Parisianised Champagne stock of which he came, the swagger and smartness of a guardsman.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the height we had now reached, the sea suggested no longer, as at Balbec, the undulations of swelling mountains, but on the contrary the view, beheld from a mountain-top or from a road winding round its flank, of a blue-green glacier or a glittering plain, situated at a lower level. The lines of the currents seemed to be fixed upon its surface, and to have traced there for ever their concentric circles; the enamelled face of the sea which changed imperceptibly in colour, assumed towards the head of the bay, where an estuary opened, the blue whiteness of milk, in which little black boats that did not move seemed entangled like flies. I felt that from nowhere could one discover a vaster prospect. But at each turn in the road a fresh expanse was added to it and when we arrived at the Douville toll-house, the spur of the cliff which until then had concealed from us half the bay, withdrew, and all of a sudden I descried upon my left a gulf as profound as that which I had already had before me, but one that changed the proportions of the other and doubled its beauty. The air at this lofty point acquired a keenness and purity that intoxicated me. I adored the Verdurins; that they should have sent a carriage for us seemed to me a touching act of kindness. I should have liked to kiss the Princess. I told her that I had never seen anything so beautiful. She professed that she too loved this spot more than any other. But I could see that to her as to the Verdurins the thing that really mattered was not to gaze at the view like tourists, but to partake of good meals there, to entertain people whom they liked, to write letters, to read books, in short to live in these surroundings, passively allowing the beauty of the scene to soak into them rather than making it the object of their attention\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the toll-house, where the carriage had stopped for a moment at such a height above the sea that, as from a mountain-top, the sight of the blue gulf beneath almost made one dizzy, I opened the window; the sound, distinctly caught, of each wave that broke in turn had something sublime in its softness and precision. Was it not like an index of measurement which, upsetting all our ordinary impressions, shews us that vertical distances may be coordinated with horizontal, in contradiction of the idea that our mind generally forms of them; and that, though they bring the sky nearer to us in this way, they are not great; that they are indeed less great for a sound which traverses them as did the sound of those little waves, the medium through which it has to pass being purer. And in fact if one went back but a couple of yards below the toll-house, one could no longer distinguish that sound of waves, which six hundred feet of cliff had not robbed of its delicate, minute and soft precision. I said to myself that my grandmother would have listened to it with the delight that she felt in all manifestations of nature or art, in the simplicity of which one discerns grandeur. I was now at the highest pitch of exaltation, which raised everything round about me accordingly. It melted my heart that the Verdurins should have sent to meet us at the station. I said as much to the Princess, who seemed to think that I was greatly exaggerating so simple an act of courtesy. I know that she admitted subsequently to Cottard that she found me very enthusiastic; he replied that I was too emotional, required sedatives and ought to take to knitting. I pointed out to the Princess every tree, every little house smothered in its mantle of roses, I made her admire everything, I would have liked to take her in my arms and press her to my heart. She told me that she could see that I had a gift for painting, that of course I must sketch, that she was surprised that nobody had told her about it. And she confessed that the country was indeed pic-I turesque. We drove through, where it perched upon its height, the little I village of Englesqueville (Engleberti villa, Brichot informed us). \u201cBut are you quite sure that there will be a party this evening, in spite of Dechambre\u2019s death, Princess?\u201d he went on, without stopping to think that the presence at the station of the carriage in which we were sitting was in itself an answer to his question. \u201cYes,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cM. Verldulin insisted that it should not be put off, simply to keep his wife from thinking. And besides, after never failing for all these years to entertain on Wednesdays, such a change in her habits would have been bound to upset her. Her nerves are velly bad just now. M. Verdurin was particularly pleased that you were coming to dine this evening, because he knew that it would be a great distraction for Mme. Verdurin,\u201d said the Princess, forgetting her pretence of having never heard my name before. \u201cI think that it will be as well not to sayanything in front of Mme. Verdurin,\u201d the Princess added. \u201cAh! I am glad you warned me,\u201d Brichot artlessly replied. \u201cI shall pass on your suggestion to Cottard.\u201d The carriage stopped for a moment. It moved on again, but the sound that the wheels had been making in the village street had ceased. We had turned into the main avenue of la Raspeli\u00e8re where M. Verdurin stood waiting for us upon the steps. \u201cI did well to put on a dinner-jacket,\u201d he said, observing with pleasure that the faithful had put on theirs, \u201csince I have such smart gentlemen in my party.\u201d And as I apologised for not having changed: \u201cWhy, that\u2019s quite all right. We\u2019re all friends here. I should be delighted to offer you one of my own dinner-jackets, but it wouldn\u2019t fit you.\u201d The handclasp throbbing with emotion which, as he entered the hall of la Raspeli\u00e8re, and by way of condolence at the death of the pianist, Brichot gave our host elicited no response from the latter. I told him how greatly I admired the scenery. \u201cAh! All the better, and you\u2019ve seen nothing, we must take you round. Why not come and spend a week or two here, the air is excellent.\u201d Brichot was afraid that his handclasp had not been understood. \u201cAh! Poor Dechambre!\u201d he said, but in an undertone, in case Mme. Verdurin was within earshot. \u201cIt is terrible,\u201d replied M. Verdurin lightly. \u201cSo young,\u201d Brichot pursued the point. Annoyed at being detained over these futilities, M. Verdurin replied in a hasty tone and with an embittered groan, not of grief but of irritated impatience: \u201cWhy yes, of course, but what\u2019s to be done about it, it\u2019s no use crying over spilt milk, talking about him won\u2019t bring him back to life, will it?\u201d And, his civility returning with his joviality: \u201cCome along, my good Brichot, get your things off quickly. We have a bouillabaisse which mustn\u2019t be kept waiting. But, in heaven\u2019s name, don\u2019t start talking about Dechambre to Madame Verdurin. You know that she always hides her feelings, but she is quite morbidly sensitive. I give you my word, when she heard that Dechambre was dead, she almost cried,\u201d said M. Verdurin in a tone of profound irony. One might have concluded, from hearing him speak, that it implied a form of insanity to regret the death of a friend of thirty years\u2019 standing, and on the other hand one gathered that the perpetual union of M. Verdurin and his wife did not preclude his constantly criticising her and her frequently irritating him. \u201cIf you mention it to her, she will go and make herself ill again. It is deplorable, three weeks after her bronchitis. When that happens, it is I who have to be sick-nurse. You can understand that I have had more than enough of it. Grieve for Dechambre\u2019s fate in your heart as much as you like. Think of him, but do not speak about him. I was very fond of Dechambre, but you cannot blame me for being fonder still of my wife. Here\u2019s Cottard, now, you can ask him.\u201d And indeed, he knew that a family doctor can do many little services, such as prescribing that one must not give way to grief\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The docile Cottard had said to the Mistress: \u201cUpset yourself like that, and to-morrow you will give me a temperature of 102,\u201d as he might have said to the cook: \u201cTo-morrow you will give me a riz de veau.\u201d Medicine, when it fails to cure the sick, busies itself with changing the sense of verbs and pronouns\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin was glad to find that Saniette, notwithstanding the snubs that he had had to endure two days earlier, had not deserted the little nucleus. And indeed Mme. Verdurin and her husband had acquired, in their idleness, cruel instincts for which the great occasions, occurring too rarely, no longer sufficed. They had succeeded in effecting a breach between Odette and Swann, between Brichot and his mistress. They would try it again with some one else, that was understood. But the opportunity did not present itself every day. Whereas, thanks to his shuddering sensibility, his timorous and quickly aroused shyness, Saniette provided them with a whipping-block for every day in the year. And so, for fear of his failing them, they took care always to invite him with friendly and persuasive words, such as the bigger boys at school, the old soldiers in a regiment, address to a recruit whom they are anxious to beguile so that they may get him into their clutches, with the sole object of flattering him for the moment and bullying him when he can no longer escape. \u201cWhatever you do,\u201d Brichot reminded Cottard, who had not heard what M. Verdurin was saying, \u201cmum\u2019s the word before Mme. Verdurin. Have no fear, O Cottard, you are dealing with a sage, as Theocritus says. Besides, M. Verdurin is right, what is the use of lamentations,\u201d he went on, for, being capable of assimilating forms of speech and the ideas which they suggested to him, but having no finer perception, he had admired in M. Verdurin\u2019s remarks the most courageous stoicism. \u201cAll the same, it is a great talent that has gone from the world.\u201d \u201cWhat, are you still talking about Dechambre,\u201d said M. Verdurin, who had gone on ahead of us, and, seeing that we were not following him, had turned back. \u201cListen,\u201d he said to Brichot, \u201cnothing is gained by exaggeration. The fact of his being dead is no excuse for making him out a genius, which he was not. He played well, I admit, and what is more, he was in his proper element here; transplanted, he ceased to exist. My wife was infatuated with him and made his reputation. You know what she is. I will go farther, in the interest of his own reputation he has died at the right moment, he is done to a turn, as the demoiselles de Caen, grilled according to the incomparable recipe of Pampilles, are going to be, I hope (unless you keep us standing here all night with your jeremiads in this Kasbah exposed to all the winds of heaven). You don\u2019t seriously expect us all to die of hunger because Dechambre is dead, when for the last year he was obliged to practise scales before giving a concert; to recover for the moment, and for the moment only, the suppleness of his wrists. Besides, you are going to hear this evening, or at any rate to meet, for the rascal is too fond of deserting his art, after dinner, for the card-table, somebody who is a far greater artist than Dechambre, a youngster whom my wife has discovered\u201d (as she had discovered Dechambre, and Paderewski, and everybody else): \u201cMorel. He has not arrived yet, the devil. He is coming with an old friend of his family whom he has picked up, and who bores him to tears, but otherwise, not to get into trouble with his father, he would have been obliged to stay down at Donci\u00e8res and keep him company: the Baron de Charlus.\u201d The faithful entered the drawing-room. M. Verdurin, who had remained behind with me while I took off my things, took my arm by way of a joke, as one\u2019s host does at a dinner-party when there is no lady for one to take in. \u201cDid you have a pleasant journey?\u201d \u201cYes, M. Brichot told me things which interested me greatly,\u201d said I, thinking of the etymologies, and because I had heard that the Verdurins greatly admired Brichot. \u201cI am surprised to hear that he told you anything,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201che is such a retiring man, and talks so little about the things he knows.\u201d This compliment did not strike me as being very apt. \u201cHe seems charming,\u201d I remarked. \u201cExquisite, delicious, not the sort of man you meet every day, such a light, fantastic touch, my wife adores him, and so do I!\u201d replied M. Verdurin in an exaggerated tone, as though repeating a lesson. Only then did I grasp that what he had said to me about Brichot was ironical. And I asked myself whether M. Verdurin, since those far-off days of which I had heard reports, had not shaken off the yoke of his wife\u2019s tutelage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sculptor was greatly astonished to learn that the Verdurins were willing to have M. de Charlus in their house. Whereas in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where M. de Charlus was so well known, nobody ever referred to his morals (of which most people had no suspicion, others remained doubtful, crediting him rather with intense but Platonic friendships, with behaving imprudently, while the enlightened few strenuously denied, shrugging their shoulders, any insinuation upon which some malicious Gallardon might venture), those morals, the nature of which was known perhaps to a few intimate friends, were, on the other hand, being denounced daily far from the circle in which he moved, just as, at times, the sound of artillery fire is audible only beyond a zone of silence. Moreover, in those professional and artistic circles where he was regarded as the typical instance of inversion, his great position in society, his noble origin were completely unknown, by a process analogous to that which, among the people of Rumania, has brought it about that the name of Ron-sard is known as that of a great nobleman, while his poetical work is unknown there. Not only that, the Rumanian estimate of Ronsard\u2019s nobility is founded upon an error. Similarly, if in the world of painters and actors M. de Charlus had such an evil reputation, that was due to their confusing him with a certain Comte Leblois de Charlus who was not even related to him (or, if so, the connexion was extremely remote), and who had been arrested, possibly by mistake, in the course of a police raid which had become historic. In short, all the stories related of our M. de Charlus referred to the other. Many professionals swore that they had had relations with M. de Charlus, and did so in good faith, believing that the false M. de Charlus was the true one, the false one possibly encouraging, partly from an affectation of nobility, partly to conceal his vice, a confusion which to the true one (the Baron whom we already know) was for a long time damaging, and afterwards, when he had begun to go down the hill, became a convenience, for it enabled him likewise to say: \u201cThat is not myself.\u201d And in the present instance it was not he to whom the rumours referred. Finally, what enhanced the falsehood of the reports of an actual fact (the Baron\u2019s tendencies), he had had an intimate and perfectly pure friendship with an author who, in the theatrical world, had for some reason acquired a similar reputation which he in no way deserved. When they were seen together at a first night, people would say: \u201cYou see,\u201d just as it was supposed that the Duchesse de Guermantes had immoral relations with the Princesse de Parme; an indestructible legend, for it would be disproved only in the presence of those two great ladies themselves, to which the people who repeated it would presumably never come any nearer than by staring at them through their glasses in the theatre and slandering them to the occupant of the next stall. Given M. de Charlus\u2019s morals, the sculptor concluded all the more readily that the Baron\u2019s social position must be equally low, since he had no sort of information whatever as to the family to which M. de Charlus belonged, his title or his name. Just as Cottard imagined that everybody knew that the degree of Doctor of Medicine implied nothing, the title of Consultant to a Hospital meant something, so people in society are mistaken when they suppose that everybody has the same idea of the social importance of their name as they themselves and the other people of their set\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Prince d\u2019Agrigente was regarded as a swindler by a club servant to whom he owed twenty-five louis, and regained his importance only in the Faubourg Saint-Germain where he had three sisters who were Duchesses, for it is not among the humble people in whose eyes he is of small account, but among the smart people who know what is what, that the great nobleman creates an effect. M. de Charlus, for that matter, was to learn in the course of the evening that his host had the vaguest ideas about the most illustrious ducal families\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certain that the Verdurins were making a grave mistake in allowing an individual of tarnished reputation to be admitted to so \u2018select\u2019 a household as theirs, the sculptor felt it his duty to take the Mistress aside. \u201cYou are entirely mistaken, besides I never pay any attention to those tales, and even if it were true, I may be allowed to point out that it could hardly compromise me!\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, furious, for Morel being the principal feature of the Wednesdays, the chief thing for her was not to give any offence to him. As for Cottard, he could not express an opinion, for he had asked leave to go upstairs for a moment to \u2018do a little job\u2019 in thebuen retiro, and after that, in M. Verdurin\u2019s bedroom, to write an extremely urgent letter for a patient\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A great publisher from Paris who had come to call, expecting to be invited to stay to dinner, withdrew abruptly, quickly, realising that he was not smart enough for the little clan. He was a tall, stout man, very dark, with a studious and somewhat cutting air. He reminded one of an ebony paper-knife\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin who, to welcome us in her immense drawing-room, in which displays of grasses, poppies, field-flowers, plucked only that morning, alternated with a similar theme painted on the walls, two centuries earlier, by an artist of exquisite taste, had risen for a moment from a game of cards which she was playing with an old friend, begged us to excuse her for just one minute while she finished her game, talking to us the while. What I told her about my impressions did not, however, seem altogether to please her. For one thing I was shocked to observe that she and her husband came indoors every day long before the hour of those sunsets which were considered so fine when seen from that cliff, and finer still from the terrace of la Raspeli\u00e8re, and which I would have travelled miles to see. \u201cYes, it\u2019s incomparable,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin carelessly, with a glance at the huge windows which gave the room a wall of glass. \u201cEven though we have it always in front of us, we never grow tired of it,\u201d and she turned her attention back to her cards. Now my very enthusiasm made me exacting. I expressed my regret that I could not see from the drawing-room the rocks of Darnetal, which, Elstir had told me, were quite lovely at that hour, when they reflected so many colours. \u201cAh! You can\u2019t see them from here, you would have to go to the end of the park, to the \u2018view of the bay.\u2019 From the seat there, you can take in the whole panorama. But you can\u2019t go there by yourself, you will lose your way. I can take you there, if you like,\u201d she added kindly. \u201cNo, no, you are not satisfied with the illness you had the other day, you want to make yourself ill again. He will come back, he can see the view of the bay another time.\u201d I did not insist, and understood that it was enough for the Verdurins to know that this sunset made its way into their drawing-room or dining-room, like a magnificent painting, like a priceless Japanese enamel, justifying the high rent that they were paying for la Raspeli\u00e8re, with plate and linen, but a thing to which they rarely raised their eyes; the important thing, here, for them was to live comfortably, to take drives, to feed well, to talk, to entertain agreeable friends whom they provided with amusing games of billiards, good meals, merry tea-parties. I noticed, however, later on, how intelligently they had learned to know the district, taking their guests for excursions as \u2018novel\u2019 as the music to which they made them listen. The part which the flowers of la Raspeli\u00e8re, the roads by the sea\u2019s edge, the old houses, the undiscovered churches, played in the life of M. Verdurin was so great that those people who saw him only in Paris and who, themselves, substituted for the life by the seaside and in the country the refinements of life in town could barely understand the idea that he himself formed of his own life, or the importance that his pleasures gave him in his own eyes. This importance was further enhanced by the fact that the Verdurins were convinced that la Raspeli\u00e8re, which they hoped to purchase, was a property without its match in the world. This superiority which their self-esteem made them attribute to la Raspeli\u00e8re justified in their eyes my enthusiasm which, but for that, would have annoyed them slightly, because of the disappointments which it involved (like my disappointment when long ago I had first listened to Berma) and which I frankly admitted to them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hear the carriage coming back,\u201d the Mistress suddenly murmured. Let us state briefly that Mme. Verdurin, quite apart from the inevitable changes due to increasing years, no longer resembled what she had been at the time when Swann and Odette used to listen to the little phrase in her house. Even when she heard it played, she was no longer obliged to assume the air of attenuated admiration which she used to assume then, for that had become her normal expression. Under the influence of the countless neuralgias which the music of Bach, Wagner, Vinteuil, Debussy had given her, Mme. Verdurin\u2019s brow had assumed enormous proportions, like limbs that are finally crippled by rheumatism. Her temples, suggestive of a pair of beautiful, pain-stricken, milk-white spheres, in which Harmony rolled endlessly, flung back upon either side her silvered tresses, and proclaimed, on the Mistress\u2019s behalf, without any need for her to say a word: \u201cI know what is in store for me to-night.\u201d Her features no longer took the trouble to formulate successively aesthetic impressions of undue violence, for they had themselves become their permanent expression on a countenance ravaged and superb. This attitude of resignation to the ever impending sufferings inflicted by Beauty, and of the courage that was required to make her dress for dinner when she had barely recovered from the effects of the last sonata, had the result that Mme. Verdurin, even when listening to the most heartrending music, preserved a disdainfully impassive countenance, and actually withdrew into retirement to swallow her two spoonfuls of aspirin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes, here they are!\u201d M. Verdurin cried with relief when he saw the door open to admit Morel, followed by M. de Charlus. The latter, to whom dining with the Verdurins meant not so much going into society as going into questionable surroundings, was as frightened as a schoolboy making his way for the first time into a brothel with the utmost deference towards its mistress. Moreover the persistent desire that M. de Charlus felt to appear virile and frigid was overcome (when he appeared in the open doorway) by those traditional ideas of politeness which are awakened as soon as shyness destroys an artificial attitude and makes an appeal to the resources of the subconscious. When it is a Charlus, whether he be noble or plebeian, that is stirred by such a sentiment of instinctive and atavistic politeness to strangers, it is always the spirit of a relative of the female sex, attendant like a goddess, or incarnate as a double, that undertakes to introduce him into a strange drawing-room and to mould his attitude until he comes face to face with his hostess. Thus a young painter, brought up by a godly, Protestant, female cousin, will enter a room, his head aslant and quivering, his eyes raised to the ceiling, his hands gripping an invisible muff, the remembered shape of which and its real and tutelary presence will help the frightened artist to cross without agoraphobia the yawning abyss between the hall and the inner drawing-room. Thus it was that the pious relative, whose memory is helping him to-day, used to enter a room years ago, and with so plaintive an air that one was asking oneself what calamity she had come to announce, when from her first words one realised, as now in the case of the painter, that she had come to pay an after-dinner call. By virtue of the same law, which requires that life, in the interests of the still unfulfilled act, shall bring into play, utilise, adulterate, in a perpetual prostitution, the most respectable, it may be the most sacred, sometimes only the most innocent legacies from the past, and albeit in this instance it engendered a different aspect, the one of Mme. Cottard\u2019s nephews who distressed his family by his effeminate ways and the company he kept would always make a joyous entry as though he had a surprise in store for you or were going to inform you that he had been left a fortune, radiant with a happiness which it would have been futile to ask him to explain, it being due to his unconscious heredity and his misplaced sex. He walked upon tiptoe, was no doubt himself astonished that he was not holding a cardcase, offered you his hand parting his lips as he had seen his aunt part hers, and his uneasy glance was directed at the mirror in which he seemed to wish to make certain, albeit he was bare-headed, whether his hat, as Mme. Cottard had once inquired of Swann, was not askew. As for M. de Charlus, whom the society in which he had lived furnished, at this critical moment, with different examples, with other patterns of affability, and above all with the maxim that one must, in certain cases, when dealing with people of humble rank, bring into play and make use of one\u2019s rarest graces, which one normally holds in reserve, it was with a flutter, archly, and with the same sweep with which a skirt would have enlarged and impeded his waddling motion that he advanced upon Mme. Verdurin with so flattered and honoured an air that one would have said that to be taken to her house was for him a supreme favour. One would have thought that it was Mme. de Marsantes who was entering the room, so prominent at that moment was the woman whom a mistake on the part of Nature had enshrined in the body of M. de Charlus. It was true that the Baron had made every effort to obliterate this mistake and to assume a masculine appearance. But no sooner had he succeeded than, he having in the meantime kept the same tastes, this habit of looking at things through a woman\u2019s eyes gave him a fresh feminine appearance, due this time not to heredity but to his own way of living. And as he had gradually come to regard even social questions from the feminine point of view, and without noticing it, for it is not only by dint of lying to other people, but also by lying to oneself that one ceases to be aware that one is lying, albeit he had called upon his body to manifest (at the moment of his entering the Verdurins\u2019 drawing-room) all the courtesy of a great nobleman, that body which had fully understood what M. de Charlus had ceased to apprehend, displayed, to such an extent that the Baron would have deserved the epithet \u2018ladylike,\u2019 all the attractions of a great lady. Not that there need be any connexion between the appearance of M. de Charlus and the fact that sons, who do not always take after their fathers, even without being inverts, and though they go after women, may consummate upon their faces the profanation of their mothers. But we need not consider here a subject that deserves a chapter to itself: the Profanation of the Mother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albeit other reasons dictated this transformation of M. de Charlus, and purely physical ferments set his material substance \u2018working\u2019 and made his body pass gradually into the category of women\u2019s bodies, nevertheless the change that we record here was of spiritual origin. By dint of supposing yourself to be ill you become ill, grow thin, are too weak to rise from your bed, suffer from nervous enteritis. By dint of thinking tenderly of men you become a woman, and an imaginary spirit hampers your movements. The obsession, just as in the other instance it affects your health, may in this instance alter your sex. Morel, who accompanied him, came to shake hands with me. From that first moment, owing to a twofold change that occurred in him I formed (alas, I was not warned in time to act upon it!) a bad impression of him. I have said that Morel, having risen above his father\u2019s menial status, was generally pleased to indulge in a contemptuous familiarity. He had talked to me on the day when he brought me the photographs without once addressing me as Monsieur, treating me as an inferior. What was my surprise at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s to see him bow very low before me, and before me alone, and to hear, before he had even uttered a syllable to anyone else, words of respect, most respectful \u2014 such words as I thought could not possibly flow from his pen or fall from his lips \u2014 addressed to myself. I at once suspected that he had some favour to ask of me. Taking me aside a minute later: \u201cMonsieur would be doing me a very great service,\u201d he said to me, going so far this time as to address me in the third person, \u201cby keeping from Mme. Verdurin and her guests the nature of the profession that my father practised with his uncle. It would be best to say that he was, in your family, the agent for estates so considerable as to put him almost on a level with your parents,\u201d Morel\u2019s request annoyed me intensely because it obliged me to magnify not his father\u2019s position, in which I took not the slightest interest, but the wealth \u2014 the apparent wealth of my own, which I felt to be absurd. But he appeared so unhappy, so pressing, that I could not refuse him. \u201cNo, before dinner,\u201d he said in an imploring tone, \u201cMonsieur can easily find some excuse for taking Mme. Verdurin aside.\u201d This was what, in the end, I did, trying to enhance to the best of my ability the distinction of Morel\u2019s father, without unduly exaggerating the \u2018style,\u2019 the \u2018worldly goods\u2019 of my own family. It went like a letter through the post, notwithstanding the astonishment of Mme. Verdurin, who had had a nodding acquaintance with my grandfather. And as she had no tact, hated family life (that dissolvent of the little nucleus), after telling me that she remembered, long ago, seeing my great-grandfather, and after speaking of him as of somebody who was almost an idiot, who would have been incapable of understanding the little group, and who, to use her expression, \u201cwas not one of us,\u201d she said to me: \u201cFamilies are such a bore, the only thing is to get right away from them;\u201d and at once proceeded to tell me of a trait in my great-grandfather\u2019s character of which I was unaware, although I might have suspected it at home (I had never seen him, but they frequently spoke of him), his remarkable stinginess (in contrast to the somewhat excessive generosity of my great-uncle, the friend of the lady in pink and Morel\u2019s father\u2019s employer): \u201cWhy, of course, if your grandparents had such a grand agent, that only shews that there are all sorts of people in a family. Your grandfather\u2019s father was so stingy that, at the end of his life, when he was almost half-witted \u2014 between you and me, he was never anything very special, you are worth the whole lot of them \u2014 he could not bring himself to pay a penny for his ride on the omnibus. So that they were obliged to have him followed by somebody who paid his fare for him, and to let the old miser think that his friend M. de Persigny, the Cabinet Minister, had given him a permit to travel free on the omnibuses. But I am delighted to hear that our Morel\u2019s father held such a good position. I was under the impression that he had been a schoolmaster, but that\u2019s nothing, I must have misunderstood. In any case, it makes not the slightest difference, for I must tell you that here we appreciate only true worth, the personal contribution, what I call the participation. Provided that a person is artistic, provided in a word that he is one of the brotherhood, nothing else matters.\u201d The way in which Morel was one of the brotherhood was \u2014 so far as I have been able to discover \u2014 that he was sufficiently fond of both women and men to satisfy either sex with the fruits of his experience of the other. But what it is essential to note here is that as soon as I had given him my word that I would speak on his behalf to Mme. Verdurin, as soon, moreover, as I had actually done so, and without any possibility of subsequent retractation, Morel\u2019s \u2018respect\u2019 for myself vanished as though by magic, the formal language of respect melted away, and indeed for some time he avoided me, contriving to appear contemptuous of me, so that if Mme. Verdurin wanted me to give him a message, to ask him to play something, he would continue to talk to one of the faithful, then move on to another, changing his seat if I approached him. The others were obliged to tell him three or four times that I had spoken to him, after which he would reply, with an air of constraint, briefly, that is to say unless we were by ourselves. When that happened, he was expansive, friendly, for there was a charming side to him. I concluded all the same from this first evening that his must be a vile nature, that he would not, at a pinch, shrink from any act of meanness, was incapable of gratitude. In which he resembled the majority of mankind. But inasmuch as I had inherited a strain of my grandmother\u2019s nature, and enjoyed the diversity of other people without expecting anything of them or resenting anything that they did, I overlooked his baseness, rejoiced in his gaiety when it was in evidence, and indeed in what I believe to have been a genuine affection on his part when, having gone the whole circuit of his false ideas of human nature, he realised (with a jerk, for he shewed strange reversions to a blind and primitive savagery) that my kindness to him was disinterested, that my indulgence arose not from a want of perception but from what he called goodness; and, more important still, I was enraptured by his art which indeed was little more than an admirable virtuosity, but which made me (without his being in the intellectual sense of the word a real musician) hear again or for the first time so much good music. Moreover a manager \u2014 M. de Charlus (whom I had not suspected of such talents, albeit Mme. de Guermantes, who had known him a very different person in their younger days, asserted that he had composed a sonata for her, painted a fan, and so forth), modest in regard to his true merits, but possessing talents of the first order, contrived to place this virtuosity at the service of a versatile artistic sense which increased it tenfold. Imagine a merely skilful performer in the Russian ballet, formed, educated, developed in all directions by M. Diaghileff\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had just given Mme. Verdurin the message with which Morel had charged me and was talking to M. de Charlus about Saint-Loup, when Cottard burst into the room announcing, as though the house were on fire, that the Cambremers had arrived. Mme. Verdurin, not wishing to appear before strangers such as M. de Charlus (whom Cottard had not seen) and myself to attach any great importance to the arrival of the Cambremers, did not move, made no response to the announcement of these tidings, and merely said to the doctor, fanning herself gracefully, and adopting the tone of a Marquise in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais: \u201cThe Baron has just been telling us. . . . \u201d This was too much for Cottard! Less abruptly than he would have done in the old days, for learning and high positions had added weight to his utterance, but with the emotion, nevertheless, which he recaptured at the Verdurins\u2019, he exclaimed: \u201cA Baron! What Baron? Where\u2019s the Baron?\u201d staring around the room with an astonishment that bordered on incredulity. Mme. Verdurin, with the affected indifference of a hostess when a servant has, in front of her guests, broken a valuable glass, and with the artificial, highfalutin tone of a conservatoire prize-winner acting in a play by the younger Dumas, replied, pointing with her fan to Morel\u2019s patron: \u201cWhy, the Baron de Charlus, to whom let me introduce you, M. le Professeur Cottard.\u201d Mme. Verdurin was, for that matter, by no means sorry to have an opportunity of playing the leading lady. M. de Charlus proffered two fingers which the Professor clasped with the kindly smile of a \u2018Prince of Science.\u2019 But he stopped short upon seeing the Cambremers enter the room, while M. de Charlus led me into a corner to tell me something, not without feeling my muscles, which is a German habit. M. de Cambremer bore no resemblance to the old Marquise. To anyone who had only heard of him, or of letters written by him, well and forcibly expressed, his personal appearance was startling. No doubt, one would grow accustomed to it. But his nose had chosen to place itself aslant above his mouth, perhaps the only crooked line, among so many, which one would never have thought of tracing upon his face, and one that indicated a vulgar stupidity, aggravated still further by the proximity of a Norman complexion on cheeks that were like two ripe apples. It is possible that the eyes of M. de Cambremer retained behind their eyelids a trace of the sky of the Cotentin, so soft upon sunny days when the wayfarer amuses himself in watching, drawn up by the roadside, and counting in their hundreds the shadows of the poplars, but those eyelids, heavy, bleared and drooping, would have prevented the least flash of intelligence from escaping. And so, discouraged by the meagreness of that azure glance, one returned to the big crooked nose. By a transposition of the senses, M. de Cambremer looked at you with his nose. This nose of his was not ugly, it was if anything too handsome, too bold, too proud of its own importance. Arched, polished, gleaming, brand new, it was amply prepared to atone for the inadequacy of his eyes. Unfortunately, if the eyes are sometimes the organ through which our intelligence is revealed, the nose (to leave out of account the intimate solidarity and the unsuspected repercussion of one feature upon the rest), the nose is generally the organ in which stupidity is most readily displayed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The propriety of the dark clothes which M. de Cambremer invariably wore, even in the morning, might well reassure those who were dazzled and exasperated by the insolent brightness of the seaside attire of people whom they did not know; still it was impossible to understand why the chief magistrate\u2019s wife should have declared with an air of discernment and authority, as a person who knows far more than you about the high society of Alen\u00e7on, that on seeing M. de Cambremer one immediately felt oneself, even before one knew who he was, in the presence of a man of supreme distinction, of a man of perfect breeding, a change from the sort of person one saw at Balbec, a man in short in whose company one could breathe freely. He was to her, stifled by all those Balbec tourists who did not know her world, like a bottle of smelling salts. It seemed to me on the contrary that he was one of the people whom my grandmother would at once have set down as \u2018all wrong,\u2019 and that, as she had no conception of snobbishness, she would no doubt have been stupefied that he could have succeeded in winning the hand of Mlle. Legrandin, who must surely be difficult to please, having a brother who was \u2018so refined.\u2019 At best one might have said of M. de Cambremer\u2019s plebeian ugliness that it was redolent of the soil and preserved a very ancient local tradition; one was reminded, on examining his faulty features, which one would have liked to correct, of those names of little Norman towns as to the etymology of which my friend the cur\u00e9 was mistaken because the peasants, mispronouncing the names, or having misunderstood the Latin or Norman words that underlay them, have finally fixed in a barbarism to be found already in the cartularies, as Brichot would have said, a wrong meaning and a fault of pronunciation. Life in these old towns may, for all that, be pleasant enough, and M. de Cambremer must have had his good points, for if it was in a mother\u2019s nature that the old Marquise should prefer her son to her daughter-in-law, on the other hand, she, who had other children, of whom two at least were not devoid of merit, was often heard to declare that the Marquis was, in her opinion, the best of the family. During the short time he had spent in the army, his messmates, finding Cambremer too long a name to pronounce, had given him the nickname Cancan, implying a flow of chatter, which he in no way merited. He knew how to brighten a dinner-party to which he was invited by saying when the fish (even if it were stale) or the entr\u00e9e came in: \u201cI say, that looks a fine animal.\u201d And his wife, who had adopted upon entering the family everything that she supposed to form part of their customs, put herself on the level of her husband\u2019s friends and perhaps sought to please him, like a mistress, and as though she had been involved in his bachelor existence, by saying in a careless tone when she was speaking of him to officers: \u201cYou shall see Cancan presently. Cancan has gone to Balbec, but he will be back this evening.\u201d She was furious at having compromised herself by coming to the Verdurins\u2019 and had done so only upon the entreaties of her mother-in-law and husband, in the hope of renewing the lease. But, being less well-bred than they, she made no secret of the ulterior motive and for the last fortnight had been making fun of this dinner-party to her women friends. \u201cYou know we are going to dine with our tenants. That will be well worth an increased rent. As a matter of fact, I am rather curious to see what they have done to our poor old la Raspeli\u00e8re\u201d (as though she had been born in the house, and would find there all her old family associations). \u201cOur old keeper told me only yesterday that you wouldn\u2019t know the place. I can\u2019t bear to think of all that must be going on there. I am sure we shall have to have the whole place disinfected before we move in again.\u201d She arrived haughty and morose, with the air of a great lady whose castle, owing to a state of war, is occupied by the enemy, but who nevertheless feels herself at home and makes a point of shewing the conquerors that they are intruding. Mme. de Cambremer could not see me at first for I was in a bay at the side of the room with M. de Charlus, who was telling me that he had heard from Morel that Morel\u2019s father had been an \u2018agent\u2019 in my family, and that he, Charlus, credited me with sufficient intelligence and magnanimity (a term common to himself and Swann) to forego the mean and ignoble pleasure which vulgar little idiots (I was warned) would not have failed, in my place, to give themselves by revealing to our hosts details which they might regard as derogatory. \u201cThe mere fact that I take an interest in him and extend my protection over him, gives him a pre-eminence and wipes out the past,\u201d the Baron concluded. As I listened to him and promised the silence which I would have kept even without any hope of being considered in return intelligent and magnanimous, I was looking at Mme. de Cambremer. And I had difficulty in recognising the melting, savoury morsel which I had had beside me the other afternoon at teatime, on the terrace at Balbec, in the Norman rock-cake that I now saw, hard as a rock, in which the faithful would in vain have tried to set their teeth. Irritated in anticipation by the knowledge that her husband inherited his mother\u2019s simple kindliness, which would make him assume a flattered expression whenever one of the faithful was presented to him, anxious however to perform her duty as a leader of society, when Brichot had been named to her she decided to make him and her husband acquainted, as she had seen her more fashionable friends do, but, anger or pride prevailing over the desire to shew her knowledge of the world, she said, not, as she ought to have said: \u201cAllow me to introduce my husband,\u201d but: \u201cI introduce you to my husband,\u201d holding aloft thus the banner of the Cambremers, without avail, for her husband bowed as low before Brichot as she had expected. But all Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s ill humour vanished in an instant when her eye fell on M. de Charlus, whom she knew by sight. Never had she succeeded in obtaining an introduction, even at the time of her intimacy with Swann. For as M. de Charlus always sided with the woman, with his sister-in-law against M. de Guermantes\u2019s mistresses, with Odette, at that time still unmarried, but an old flame of Swann\u2019s, against the new, he had, as a stern defender of morals and faithful protector of homes, given Odette \u2014 and kept \u2014 the promise that he would never allow himself to be presented to Mme. de Cambremer. She had certainly never guessed that it was at the Verdurins\u2019 that she was at length to meet this unapproachable person. M. de Cambremer knew that this was a great joy to her, so great that he himself was moved by it and looked at his wife with an air that implied: \u201cYou are glad now you decided to come, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He spoke very little, knowing that he had married a superior woman. \u201cI, all unworthy,\u201d he would say at every moment, and spontaneously quoted a fable of La Fontaine and one of Florian which seemed to him to apply to his ignorance, and at the same time enable him, beneath the outward form of a contemptuous flattery, to shew the men of science who were not members of the Jockey that one might be a sportsman and yet have read fables. The unfortunate thing was that he knew only two of them. And so they kept cropping up. Mme. de Cambremer was no fool, but she had a number of extremely irritating habits. With her the corruption of names bore absolutely no trace of aristocratic disdain. She was not the person to say, like the Duchesse de Guermantes (whom the mere fact of her birth ought to have preserved even more than Mme. de Cambremer from such an absurdity), with a pretence of not remembering the unfashionable name (albeit it is now that of one of the women whom it is most difficult to approach) of Julien de Monch\u00e2teau: \u201ca little Madame . . . Pica della Mirandola.\u201d No, when Mme. de Cambremer said a name wrong it was out of kindness of heart, so as not to appear to know some damaging fact, and when, in her sincerity, she admitted it, she tried to conceal it by altering it. If, for instance, she was defending a woman, she would try to conceal the fact, while determined not to lie to the person who had asked her to tell the truth, that Madame So-and-so was at the moment the mistress of M. Sylvain Levy, and would say: \u201cNo . . . I know absolutely nothing about her, I fancy that people used to charge her with having inspired a passion in a gentleman whose name I don\u2019t know, something like Cahn, Kohn, Kuhn; anyhow, I believe the gentleman has been dead for years and that there was never anything between them.\u201d This is an analogous, but contrary process to that adopted by liars who think that if they alter their statement of what they have been doing when they make it to a mistress or merely to another man, their listener will not immediately see that the expression (like her Cahn, Kohn, Kuhn) is interpolated, is of a different texture from the rest of the conversation, has a double meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin whispered in her husband\u2019s ear: \u201cShall I offer my arm to the Baron de Charlus? As you will have Mme. de Cambremer on your right, we might divide the honours.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201csince the other is higher in rank\u201d (meaning that M. de Cambremer was a Marquis), \u201cM. de Charlus is, strictly speaking, his inferior.\u201d \u201cVery well, I shall put him beside the Princess.\u201d And Mme. Verdurin introduced Mme. Sherbatoff to M. de Charlus; each of them bowed in silence, with an air of knowing all about the other and of promising a mutual secrecy. M. Verdurin introduced me to M. de Cambremer. Before he had even begun to speak in his loud and slightly stammering voice, his tall figure and high complexion displayed in their oscillation the martial hesitation of a commanding officer who tries to put you at your ease and says: \u201cI have heard about you, I shall see what can be done; your punishment shall be remitted; we don\u2019t thirst for blood here; it will be all right.\u201d Then, as he shook my hand: \u201cI think you know my mother,\u201d he said to me. The word \u2018think\u2019 seemed to him appropriate to the discretion of a first meeting, but not to imply any uncertainty, for he went on: \u201cI have a note for you from her.\u201d M. de Cambremer took a childish pleasure in revisiting a place where he had lived for so long. \u201cI am at home again,\u201d he said to Mme. Verdurin, while his eyes marvelled at recognising the flowers painted on panels over the doors, and the marble busts on their high pedestals. He might, all the same, have felt himself at sea, for Mme. Verdurin had brought with her a quantity of fine old things of her own. In this respect, Mme. Verdurin, while regarded by the Cambremers as having turned everything upside down, was not revolutionary but intelligently conservative in a sense which they did not understand. They were thus wrong in accusing her of hating the old house and of degrading it by hanging plain cloth curtains instead of their rich plush, like an ignorant parish priest reproaching a diocesan architect with putting back in its place the old carved wood which the cleric had thrown on the rubbish heap, and had seen fit to replace with ornaments purchased in the Place Saint-Sulpice. Furthermore, a herb garden was beginning to take the place, in front of the mansion, of the borders that were the pride not merely of the Cambremers but of their gardener. The latter, who regarded the Cambremers as his sole masters, and groaned beneath the yoke of the Verdurins, as though the place were under occupation for the moment by an invading army, went in secret to unburden his griefs to its dispossessed mistress, grew irate at the scorn that was heaped upon his araucarias, begonias, house-leeks, double dahlias, and at anyone\u2019s daring in so grand a place to grow such common plants as camomile and maidenhair. Mme. Verdurin felt this silent opposition and had made up her mind, if she took a long lease of la Raspeli\u00e8re or even bought the place, to make one of her conditions the dismissal of the gardener, by whom his old mistress, on the contrary, set great store. He had worked for her without payment, when times were bad, he adored her; but by that odd multiformity of opinion which we find in the lower orders, among whom the most profound moral scorn is embedded in the most passionate admiration, which in turn overlaps old and undying grudges, he used often to say of Mme. de Cambremer who, in \u201870, in a house that she owned in the East of France, surprised by the invasion, had been obliged to endure for a month the contact of the Germans: \u201cWhat many people can\u2019t forgive Mme. la Marquise is that during the war she took the side of the Prussians and even had them to stay in her house. At any other time, I could understand it; but in war time, she ought not to have done it. It is not right.\u201d So that he was faithful to her unto death, venerated her for her goodness, and firmly believed that she had been guilty of treason. Mme. Verdurin was annoyed that M. de Cambremer should pretend to feel so much at home at la Raspeli\u00e8re. \u201cYou must notice a good many changes, all the same,\u201d she replied. \u201cFor one thing there were those big bronze Barbedienne devils and some horrid little plush chairs which I packed off at once to the attic, though even that is too good a place for them.\u201d After this bitter retort to M. de Cambremer, she offered him her arm to go in to dinner. He hesitated for a moment, saying to himself: \u201cI can\u2019t, really, go in before M. de Charlus.\u201d But supposing the other to be an old friend of the house, seeing that he was not set in the post of honour, he decided to take the arm that was offered him and told Mme. Verdurin how proud he felt to be admitted into the symposium (so it was that he styled the little nucleus, not without a smile of satisfaction at his knowledge of the term). Cottard, who was seated next to M. de Charlus, beamed at him through his glass, to make his acquaintance and to break the ice, with a series of winks far more insistent than they would have been in the old days, and not interrupted by fits of shyness. And these engaging glances, enhanced by the smile that accompanied them, were no longer dammed by the glass but overflowed on all sides. The Baron, who readily imagined people of his own kind everywhere, had no doubt that Cottard was one, and was making eyes at him. At once he turned on the Professor the cold shoulder of the invert, as contemptuous of those whom he attracts as he is ardent in pursuit of such as attract him. No doubt, albeit each one of us speaks mendaciously of the pleasure, always refused him by destiny, of being loved, it is a general law, the application of which is by no means confined to the Charlus type, that the person whom we do not love and who does love us seems to us quite intolerable. To such a person, to a woman of whom we say not that she loves us but that she bores us, we prefer the society of any other, who has neither her charm, nor her looks, nor her brains. She will recover these, in our estimation, only when she has ceased to love us. In this light, we might see only the transposition, into odd terms, of this universal rule in the irritation aroused in an invert by a man who displeases him and runs after him. And so, whereas the ordinary man seeks to conceal what he feels, the invert is implacable in making it felt by the man who provokes it, as he would certainly not make it felt by a woman, M. de Charlus for instance by the Princesse de Guermantes, whose passion for him bored him, but flattered him. But when they see another man shew a peculiar liking for them, then, whether because they fail to realise that this liking is the same as their own, or because it annoys them to be reminded that this liking, which they glorify so long as it is they themselves that feel it, is regarded as a vice, or from a desire to rehabilitate themselves by a sensational display in circumstances in which it costs them nothing, or from a fear of being unmasked which they at once recover as soon as desire no longer leads them blindfold from one imprudence to another, or from rage at being subjected, by the equivocal attitude of another person, to the injury which, by their own attitude, if that other person attracted them, they would not be afraid to inflict on him, the men who do not in the least mind following a young man for miles, never taking their eyes off him in the theatre, even if he is with friends, and there is therefore a danger of their compromising him with them, may be heard, if a man who does not attract them merely looks at them, to say: \u201cSir, for what do you take me?\u201d (simply because he takes them for what they are) \u201cI don\u2019t understand, no, don\u2019t attempt to explain, you are quite mistaken,\u201d pass if need be from words to blows, and, to a person who knows the imprudent stranger, wax indignant: \u201cWhat, you know that loathsome creature. He stares at one so! . . . A fine way to behave!\u201d M. de Charlus did not go quite as far as this, but assumed the offended, glacial air adopted, when one appears to be suspecting them, by women who are not of easy virtue, even more by women who are. Furthermore, the invert brought face to face with an invert sees not merely an unpleasing image of himself which, being purely inanimate, could at the worst only injure his self-esteem, but a second self, living, acting in the same sphere, capable therefore of injuring him in his loves. And so it is from an instinct of self-preservation that he will speak evil of the possible rival, whether to people who are able to do him some injury (nor does invert the first mind being thought a liar when he thus denounces invert the second before people who may know all about his own case), or to the young man whom he has \u2018picked up,\u2019 who is perhaps going to be snatched away from him and whom it is important to persuade that the very things which it is to his advantage to do with the speaker would be the bane of his life if he allowed himself to do them with the other person. To M. de Charlus, who was thinking perhaps of the \u2014 wholly imaginary \u2014 dangers in which the presence of this Cottard whose smile he misinterpreted might involve Morel, an invert who did not attract him was not merely a caricature of himself, but was a deliberate rival. A tradesman, practising an uncommon trade, who, on his arrival in the provincial town where he intends to settle for life discovers that, in the same square, directly opposite, the same trade is being carried on by a competitor, is no more discomfited than a Charlus who goes down to a quiet spot to make love unobserved and, on the day of his arrival, catches sight of the local squire or the barber, whose aspect and manner leave no room for doubt. The tradesman often comes to regard his competitor with hatred; this hatred degenerates at times into melancholy, and, if there be but a sufficient strain of heredity, one has seen in small towns the tradesman begin to shew signs of insanity which is cured only by his deciding to sell his stock and goodwill and remove to another place. The invert\u2019s rage is even more agonising. He has realised that from the first moment the squire and the barber have desired his young companion. Even though he repeat to him a hundred times daily that the barber and the squire are scoundrels whose contact would dishonour him, he is obliged, like Harpagon, to watch over his treasure, and rises in the night to make sure that it is not being stolen. And it is this no doubt that, even more than desire, or the convenience of habits shared in common, and almost as much as that experience of oneself which is the only true experience, makes one invert detect another with a rapidity and certainty that are almost infallible. He may be mistaken for a moment, but a rapid divination brings him back to the truth. And so M. de Charlus\u2019s error was brief. His divine discernment shewed him after the first minute that Cottard was not of his kind, and that he need not fear his advances either for himself, which would merely have annoyed him, or for Morel, which would have seemed to him a more serious matter. He recovered his calm, and as he was still beneath the influence of the transit of Venus Androgyne, now and again, he smiled a faint smile at the Verdurins without taking the trouble to open his mouth, merely curving his lips at one corner, and for an instant kindled a coquettish light in his eyes, he so obsessed with virility, exactly as his sister-in-law the Duchesse de Guermantes might have done. \u201cDo you shoot much, Sir?\u201d said M. Verdurin with a note of contempt to M. de Cambremer. \u201cHas Ski told you of the near shave we had to-day?\u201d Cottard inquired of the mistress. \u201cI shoot mostly in the forest of Chantepie,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer. \u201cNo, I have told her nothing,\u201d said Ski. \u201cDoes it deserve its name?\u201d Brichot asked M. de Cambremer, after a glance at me from the corner of his eye, for he had promised me that he would introduce the topic of derivations, begging me at the same time not to let the Cambremers know the scorn that he felt for those furnished by the Combray cur\u00e9. \u201cI am afraid I must be very stupid, but I don\u2019t grasp your question,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cI mean to say: do many pies sing in it?\u201d replied Brichot. Cottard meanwhile could not bear Mme. Verdurin\u2019s not knowing that they had nearly missed the train. \u201cOut with it,\u201d Mme. Cottard said to her husband encouragingly, \u201ctell us your odyssey.\u201d \u201cWell, really, it is quite out of the Ordinary,\u201d said the doctor, and repeated his narrative from the beginning. \u201cWhen I saw that the train was in the station, I stood thunderstruck. It was all Ski\u2019s fault. You are somewhat wide of the mark in your information, my dear fellow! And there was Brichot waiting for us at the station!\u201d \u201cI assumed,\u201d said the scholar, casting around him what he could still muster of a glance and smiling with his thin lips, \u201cthat if you had been detained at Graincourt, it would mean that you had encountered some peripatetic siren.\u201d \u201cWill you hold your tongue, if my wife were to hear you!\u201d said the Professor. \u201cThis wife of mine, it is jealous.\u201d \u201cAh! That Brichot,\u201d cried Ski, moved to traditional merriment by Brichot\u2019s spicy witticism, \u201che is always the same;\u201d albeit he had no reason to suppose that the university don had ever indulged in obscenity. And, to embellish this consecrated utterance with the ritual gesture, he made as though he could not resist the desire to pinch Brichot\u2019s leg. \u201cHe never changes, the rascal,\u201d Ski went on, and without stopping to think of the effect, at once tragic and comic, that the don\u2019s semi-blindness gave to his words: \u201cAlways a sharp look-out for the ladies.\u201d \u201cYou see,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, \u201cwhat it is to meet with a scholar. Here have I been shooting for fifteen years in the forest of Chantepie, and I\u2019ve never even thought of what the name meant.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer cast a stern glance at her husband; she did not like him to humble himself thus before Brichot. She was even more annoyed when, at every \u2018ready-made\u2019 expression that Cancan employed, Cottard, who knew the ins and outs of them all, having himself laboriously acquired them, pointed out to the Marquis, who admitted his stupidity, that they meant nothing. \u201cWhy \u2018stupid as a cabbage?\u2019 Do you suppose cabbages are stupider than anything else? You say:\u2018repeat the same thing thirty-six times.\u2019 Why thirty-six? Why do you say:\u2018sleep like a top?\u2019 Why \u2018Thunder of Brest?\u2019 Why \u2018play four hundred tricks?\u2019\u201d But at this, the defence of M. de Cambremer was taken up by Brichot who explained the origin of each of these expressions. But Mme. de Cambremer was occupied principally in examining the changes that the Verdurins had introduced at la Raspeli\u00e8re, in order that she might be able to criticise some, and import others, or possibly the same ones, to F\u00e9terne. \u201cI keep wondering what that lustre is that\u2019s hanging all crooked. I can hardly recognise my old Raspeli\u00e8re,\u201d she went on, with a familiarly aristocratic air, as she might have spoken of an old servant meaning not so much to indicate his age as to say that she had seen him in his cradle. And, as she was a trifle bookish in her speech: \u201cAll the same,\u201d she added in an undertone, \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that if I were inhabiting another person\u2019s house, I should feel some compunction about altering everything like this.\u201d \u201cIt is a pity you didn\u2019t come with them,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin to M. de Charlus and Morel, hoping that M. de Charlus was now \u2018enrolled\u2019 and would submit to the rule that they must all arrive by the same train. \u201cYou are sure that Chantepie means the singing magpie, Chochotte?\u201d she went on, to shew that, like the great hostess that she was, she could join in every conversation at the same time. \u201cTell me something about this violinist,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer said to me, \u201che interests me; I adore music, and it seems to me that I have heard of him before, complete my education.\u201d She had heard that Morel had come with M. de Charlus and hoped, by getting the former to come to her house, to make friends with the latter. She added, however, so that I might not guess her reason for asking, \u201cM. Brichot, too, interests me.\u201d For, even if she was highly cultivated, just as certain persons inclined to obesity eat hardly anything, and take exercise all day long without ceasing to grow visibly fatter, so Mme. de Cambremer might in vain master, and especially at F\u00e9terne, a philosophy that became ever more esoteric, music that became ever more subtle, she emerged from these studies only to weave plots that would enable her to cut the middle-class friends of her girlhood and to form the connexions which she had originally supposed to be part of the social life of her \u2018in laws,\u2019 and had then discovered to be far more exalted and remote. A philosopher who was not modern enough for her, Leibnitz, has said that the way is long from the intellect to the heart. This way Mme. de Cambremer had been no more capable than her brother of traversing. Abandoning the study of John Stuart Mill only for that of Lachelier, the less she believed in the reality of the external world, the more desperately she sought to establish herself, before she died, in a good position in it. In her passion for realism in art, no object seemed to her humble enough to serve as a model to painter or writer. A fashionable picture or novel would have made her feel sick; Tolstoi\u2019s mujiks, or Millet\u2019s peasants, were the extreme social boundary beyond which she did not allow the artist to pass. But to cross the boundary that limited her own social relations, to raise herself to an intimate acquaintance with Duchesses, this was the goal of all her efforts, so ineffective had the spiritual treatment to which she subjected herself, by the study of great masterpieces, proved in overcoming the congenital and morbid snobbishness that had developed in her. This snobbishness had even succeeded in curing certain tendencies to avarice and adultery to which in her younger days she had been inclined, just as certain peculiar and permanent pathological conditions seem to render those who are subject to them immune to other maladies. I could not, all the same, refrain, as I listened to her, from giving her credit, without deriving any pleasure from them, for the refinement of her expressions. They were those that are used, at a given date, by all the people of the same intellectual breadth, so that the refined expression provides us at once, like the arc of a circle, with the means to describe and limit the entire circumference. And so the effect of these expressions is that the people who employ them bore me immediately, because I feel that I already know them, but are generally regarded as superior persons, and have often been offered me as delightful and unappreciated companions. \u201cYou cannot fail to be aware, Madame, that many forest regions take their name from the animals that inhabit them. Next to the forest of Chantepie, you have the wood Chantereine.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know who the queen may be, but you are not very polite to her,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cOne for you, Chochotte,\u201d said Mme. de Verdurin. \u201cAnd apart from that, did you have a pleasant journey?\u201d \u201cWe encountered only vague human beings who thronged the train. But I must answer M. de Cambremer\u2019s question; reine, in this instance, is not the wife of a king, but a frog. It is the name that the frog has long retained in this district, as is shewn by the station, Renneville, which ought to be spelt Reineville.\u201d \u201cI say, that seems a fine animal,\u201d said M. de Cambremer to Mme. Verdurin, pointing to a fish. (It was one of the compliments by means of which he considered that he paid his scot at a dinner-party, and gave an immediate return of hospitality. \u201cThere is no need to invite them,\u201d he would often say, in speaking of one or other couple of their friends to his wife. \u201cThey were delighted to have us. It was they that thanked me for coming.\u201d) \u201cI must tell you, all the same, that I have been going every day for years to Renneville, and I have never seen any more frogs there than anywhere else. Madame de Cambremer brought the cur\u00e9 here from a parish where she owns a considerable property, who has very much the same turn of mind as yourself, it seems to me. He has written a book.\u201d \u201cI know, I have read it with immense interest,\u201d Brichot replied hypocritically. The satisfaction that his pride received indirectly from this answer made M. de Cambremer laugh long and loud. \u201cAh! well, the author of, what shall I say, this geography, this glossary, dwells at great length upon the name of a little place of which we were formerly, if I may say so, the Lords, and which is called Pont-a-Couleuvre. Of course I am only an ignorant rustic compared with such a fountain of learning, but I have been to Pont-\u00e0-Couleuvre a thousand times if he\u2019s been there once, and devil take me if I ever saw one of his beastly serpents there, I say beastly, in spite of the tribute the worthy La Fontaine pays them.\u201d (The Man and the Serpent was one of his two fables.) \u201cYou have not seen any, and you have been quite right,\u201d replied Brichot. \u201cUndoubtedly, the writer you mention knows his subject through and through, he has written a remarkable book.\u201d \u201cThere!\u201d exclaimed Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cthat book, there\u2019s no other word for it, is a regular Benedictine opus.\u201d \u201cNo doubt he has consulted various polyptychs (by which we mean the lists of benefices and cures of each diocese), which may have furnished him with the names of lay patrons and ecclesiastical collators. But there are other sources. One of the most learned of my friends has delved into them. He found that the place in question was named Pont-a-Quileuvre. This odd name encouraged him to carry his researches farther, to a Latin text in which the bridge that your friend supposes to be infested with serpents is styled Pons cui aperit: A closed bridge that was opened only upon due payment.\u201d \u201cYou were speaking of frogs. I, when I find myself among such learned folk, feel like the frog before the areopagus,\u201d (this being his other fable) said Cancan who often indulged, with a hearty laugh, in this pleasantry thanks to which he imagined himself to be making, at one and the same time, out of humility and with aptness, a profession of ignorance and a display of learning. As for Cottard, blocked upon one side by M. de Charlus\u2019s silence, and driven to seek an outlet elsewhere, he turned to me with one of those questions which so impressed his patients when it hit the mark and shewed them that he could put himself so to speak inside their bodies; if on the other hand it missed the mark, it enabled him to check certain theories, to widen his previous point of view. \u201cWhen you come to a relatively high altitude, such as this where we now are, do you find that the change increases your tendency to choking fits?\u201d he asked me with the certainty of either arousing admiration or enlarging his own knowledge. M. de Cambremer heard the question and smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how amused I am to hear that you have choking fits,\u201d he flung at me across the table. He did not mean that it made him happy, though as a matter of fact it did. For this worthy man could not hear any reference to another person\u2019s sufferings without a feeling of satisfaction and a spasm of hilarity which speedily gave place to the instinctive pity of a kind heart. But his words had another meaning which was indicated more precisely by the clause that followed. \u201cIt amuses me,\u201d he explained, \u201cbecause my sister has them too.\u201d And indeed it did amuse him, as it would have amused him to hear me mention as one of my friends a person who was constantly coming to their house. \u201cHow small the world is,\u201d was the reflexion which he formed mentally and which I saw written upon his smiling face when Cottard spoke to me of my choking fits. And these began to establish themselves, from the evening of this dinner-party, as a sort of interest in common, after which M. de Cambremer never failed to inquire, if only to hand on a report to his sister. As I answered the questions with which his wife kept plying me about Morel, my thoughts returned to a conversation I had had with my mother that afternoon. Having, without any attempt to dissuade me from going to the Verdurins\u2019 if there was a chance of my being amused there, suggested that it was a house of which my grandfather would not have approved, which would have made him exclaim: \u201cOn guard!\u201d my mother had gone on to say: \u201cListen, Judge Toureuil and his wife told me they had been to luncheon with Mme. Bon-temps. They asked me no questions. But I seemed to gather from what was said that your marriage to Albertine would be the joy of her aunt\u2019s life. I think the real reason is that they are all extremely fond of you. At the same time the style in which they suppose that you would be able to keep her, the sort of friends they more or less know that we have, all that is not, I fancy, left out of account, although it may be a minor consideration. I should not have mentioned it to you myself, because I attach no importance to it, but as I imagine that people will mention it to you, I prefer to get a word in first.\u201d \u201cBut you yourself, what do you think of her?\u201d I asked my mother. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not I that am going to marry her. You might certainly do a thousand times better. But I feel that your grandmother would not have liked me to influence you. As a matter of fact, I cannot tell you what I think of Albertine; I don\u2019t think of her. I shall say to you, like Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u2018She has good qualities, at least I suppose so. But at this first stage I can praise her only by negatives. One thing she is not, she has not the Rennes accent. In time, I shall perhaps say, she is something else. And I shall always think well of her if she can make you happy.\u2019\u201d But by these very words which left it to myself to decide my own happiness, my mother had plunged me in that state of doubt in which I had been plunged long ago when, my father having allowed me to go to Ph\u00e8dre and, what was more, to take to writing, I had suddenly felt myself burdened with too great a responsibility, the fear of distressing him, and that melancholy which we feel when we cease to obey orders which, from one day to another, keep the future hidden, and realise that we have at last begun to live in real earnest, as a grown-up person, the life, the only life that any of us has at his disposal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the best thing would be to wait a little longer, to begin by regarding Albertine as in the past, so as to find out whether I really loved her. I might take her, as a distraction, to see the Verdurins, and this thought reminded me that I had come there myself that evening only to learn whether Mme. Putbus was staying there or was expected. In any case, she was not dining with them. \u201cSpeaking of your friend Saint-Loup,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer, using an expression which shewed a closer sequence in her ideas than her remarks might have led one to suppose, for if she spoke to me about music she was thinking about the Guermantes; \u201cyou know that everybody is talking about his marriage to the niece of the Princesse de Guermantes. I may tell you that, so far as I am concerned, all that society gossip leaves me cold.\u201d I was seized by a fear that I might have spoken unfeelingly to Robert about the girl in question, a girl full of sham originality, whose mind was as mediocre as her actions were violent. Hardly ever do we hear anything that does \u2018not make us regret something that we have said. I replied to Mme. de Cambremer, truthfully as it happened, that I knew nothing about it, and that anyhow I thought that the girl was still too young to be engaged. \u201cThat is perhaps why it is not yet official, anyhow there is a lot of talk about it.\u201d \u201cI ought to warn you,\u201d Mme. Verdurin observed dryly to Mme. de Cambremer, having heard her talking to me about Morel and supposing, when Mme. de Cambremer lowered her voice to speak of Saint-Loup\u2019s engagement, that Morel was still under discussion. \u201cYou needn\u2019t expect any light music here. In matters of art, you know, the faithful who come to my Wednesdays, my children as I call them, are all fearfully advanced,\u201d she added with an air of proud terror. \u201cI say to them sometimes: My dear people, you move too fast for your Mistress, not that she has ever been said to be afraid of anything daring. Every year it goes a little farther; I can see the day coming when they will have no more use for Wagner or Indy.\u201d \u201cBut it is splendid to be advanced, one can never be advanced enough,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer, scrutinising as she spoke every corner of the dining-room, trying to identify the things that her mother-in-law had left there, those that Mme. Verdurin had brought with her, and to convict the latter red-handed of want of taste. At the same time, she tried to get me to talk of the subject that interested her most, M. de Charlus. She thought it touching that he should be looking after a violinist. \u201cHe seems intelligent.\u201d \u201cWhy, his mind is extremely active for a man of his age,\u201d said I. \u201cAge? But he doesn\u2019t seem at all old, look, the hair is still young.\u201d (For, during the last three or four years, the word hair had been used with the article by one of those unknown persons who launch the literary fashions, and everybody at the same radius from the centre as Mme. de Cambremer would say \u2018the hair,\u2019 not without an affected smile. At the present day, people still say \u2018the hair\u2019 but, from an excessive use of the article, the pronoun will be born again.) \u201cWhat interests me most about M. de Charlus,\u201d she went on, \u201cis that one can feel that he has the gift. I may tell you that I attach little importance to knowledge. Things that can be learned do not interest me.\u201d This speech was not incompatible with Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s own distinction which was, in the fullest sense, imitated and acquired. But it so happened that one of the things which one had to know at that moment was that knowledge is nothing, and is not worth a straw when compared with originality. Mme. de Cambremer had learned, with everything else, that one ought not to learn anything. \u201cThat is why,\u201d she explained to me, \u201cBrichot, who has an interesting side to him, for I am not one to despise a certain spicy erudition, interests me far less.\u201d But Brichot, at that moment, was occupied with one thing only; hearing people talk about music, he trembled lest the subject should remind Mme. Verdurin of the death of Dechambre. He decided to say something that would avert that harrowing memory. M. de Cambremer provided him with an opportunity with the question: \u201cYou mean to say that wooded places always take their names from animals?\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Brichot, proud to display his learning before so many strangers, among whom, I had told him, he would be certain to interest one at least. \u201cWe have only to consider how often, even in the names of people, a tree is preserved, like a fern in a piece of coal. One of our Conscript Fathers is called M. de Saulces de Freycinet, which means, if I be not mistaken, a spot planted with willows and ashes, salix et fraxinetum; his nephew M. de Selves combines more trees still, since he is named de Selves, de sylvis.\u201d Saniette was delighted to see the conversation take so animated a turn. He could, since Brichot was talking all the time, preserve a silence which would save him from being the butt of M. and Mme. Verdurin\u2019s wit. And growing even more sensitive in his joy at being set free, he had been touched when he heard M. Verdurin, notwithstanding the formality of so grand a dinner-party, tell the butler to put a decanter of water in front of M. Saniette who never drank anything else. (The generals responsible for the death of most soldiers insist upon their being well fed.) Moreover, Mme. Verdurin had actually smiled once at Saniette. Decidedly, they were kind people. He was not going to be tortured any more. At this moment the meal was interrupted by one of the party whom I have forgotten to mention, an eminent Norwegian philosopher who spoke French very well but very slowly, for the twofold reason that, in the first place, having learned the language only recently and not wishing to make mistakes (he did, nevertheless, make some), he referred each word to a sort of mental dictionary, and secondly, being a metaphysician, he always thought of what he intended to say while he was saying it, which, even in a Frenchman, causes slowness of utterance. He was, otherwise, a charming person, although similar in appearance to many other people, save in one respect. This man so slow in his diction (there was an interval of silence after every word) acquired a startling rapidity in escaping from the room as soon as he had said good-bye. His haste made one suppose, the first time one saw him, that he was suffering from colic or some even more urgent need\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear \u2014 colleague,\u201d he said to Brichot, after deliberating in his mind whether colleague was the correct term, \u201cI have a sort of \u2014 desire to know whether there are other trees in the \u2014 nomenclature of your beautiful French \u2014 Latin \u2014 Norman tongue. Madame\u201d (lie meant Madame Verdurin, although he dared not look at her) \u201chas told me that you know everything. Is not this precisely the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, it is the moment for eating,\u201d interrupted Mme. Verdurin, who saw the dinner becoming interminable. \u201cVery well,\u201d the Scandinavian replied, bowing his head over his plate with a resigned and sorrowful smile. \u201cBut I must point out to Madame that if I have permitted myself this questionnaire \u2014 pardon me, this questation \u2014 it is because I have to return to-morrow to Paris to dine at the Tour d\u2019Argent or at the H\u00f4tel Meurice, My French \u2014 brother \u2014 M. Boutroux is to address us there about certain seances of spiritualism \u2014 pardon me, certain spirituous evocations which he has controlled.\u201d \u201cThe Tour d\u2019Argent is not nearly as good as they make out,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin sourly. \u201cIn fact, I have had some disgusting dinners there.\u201d \u201cBut am I mistaken, is not the food that one consumes at Madame\u2019s table an example of the finest French cookery?\u201d \u201cWell, it is not positively bad,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, sweetening. \u201cAnd if you come next Wednesday, it will be better.\u201d \u201cBut I am leaving on Monday for Algiers, and from there I am going to the Cape. And when I am at the Cape of Good Hope, I shall no longer be able to meet my illustrious colleague \u2014 pardon me, I shall no longer be able to meet my brother.\u201d And he set to work obediently, after offering these retrospective apologies, to devour his food at a headlong pace. But Brichot was only too delighted to be able to furnish other vegetable etymologies, and replied, so greatly interesting the Norwegian that he again stopped eating, but with a sign to the servants that they might remove his plate and help him to the next course. \u201cOne of the Forty,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cis named Houssaye, or a place planted with hollies; in the name of a brilliant diplomat, d\u2019Ormesson, you will find the elm, theulmus beloved of Virgil, which has given its name to the town of Ulm; in the names of his colleagues, M. de la Boulaye, the birch (bouleau), M. d\u2019Aunay, the alder (aune), M. de Buissi\u00e8re, the box (buis), M. Albaret, the sapwood (aubier)\u201d (I made a mental note that I must tell this to C\u00e9leste), \u201cM. de Cholet, the cabbage (chou), and the apple-tree (pommier) in the name of M. de la Pommeraye, whose lectures we used to attend, do you remember, Saniette, in the days when the worthy Porel had been sent to the farthest ends of the earth, as Proconsul in Odeonia?\u201d \u201cYou said that Cholet was derived from chou,\u201d I remarked to Brichot. \u201cAm I to suppose that the name of a station I passed before reaching Donci\u00e8res, Saint-Frichoux, comes from chou also?\u201d \u201cNo, Saint-Frichoux is Sanctus Fruc-tuosus, asSanctus Ferreolus gave rise to Saint-Fargeau, but that is not Norman in the least.\u201d \u201cHe knows too much, he\u2019s boring us,\u201d the Princess muttered softly. \u201cThere are so many other names that interest me, but I can\u2019t ask you everything at once.\u201d And, turning to Cottard, \u201cIs Madame Putbus here?\u201d I asked him. On hearing Brichot utter the name of Saniette, M. Verdurin cast at his wife and at Cottard an ironical glance which confounded their timid guest. \u201cNo, thank heaven,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, who had overheard my question, \u201cI have managed to turn her thoughts in the direction of Venice, we are rid of her for this year.\u201d \u201cI shall myself be entitled presently to two trees,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cfor I have more or less taken a little house between Saint-Martin-du-Chene and Saint-Pierre-des-Ifs.\u201d \u201cBut that is quite close to here, I hope that you will come over often with Charlie Morel. You have only to come to an arrangement with our little group about the trains, you are only a step from Donci\u00e8res,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, who hated people\u2019s not coming by the same train and not arriving at the hours when she sent carriages to meet them. She knew how stiff the climb was to la Raspeli\u00e8re, even if you took the zigzag path, behind F\u00e9terne, which was half-an-hour longer; she was afraid that those of her guests who kept to themselves might not find carriages to take them, or even, having in reality stayed away, might plead the excuse that they had not found a carriage at Douville-F\u00e9terne, and had not felt strong enough to make so stiff a climb on foot. To this invitation M. de Charlus responded with a silent bow. \u201cHe\u2019s not the sort of person you can talk to any day of the week, he seems a tough customer,\u201d the doctor whispered to Ski, for having remained quite simple, notwithstanding a surface-dressing of pride, he made no attempt to conceal the fact that Charlus had snubbed him. \u201cHe is doubtless unaware that at all the watering-places, and even in Paris in the wards, the physicians, who naturally regard me as their \u2018chief,\u2019 make it a point of honour to introduce me to all the noblemen present, not that they need to be asked twice. It makes my stay at the spas quite enjoyable,\u201d he added carelessly. \u201cIndeed at Donci\u00e8res the medical officer of the regiment, who is the doctor who attends the Colonel, invited me to luncheon to meet him, saying that I was fully entitled to dine with the General. And that General is a Monsieur de something. I don\u2019t know whether his title-deeds are more or less ancient than those of this Baron.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about him, his is a very humble coronet,\u201d replied Ski in an undertone, and added some vague statement including a word of which I caught only the last syllable, -ast, being engaged in listening to what Brichot was saying to M. de Charlus. \u201cNo, as for that, I am sorry to say, you have probably one tree only, for if Saint-Martin-du-Ch\u00eane is obviouslySanctus Martinus juxta quercum, on the other hand, the word if may be simply the root ave, eve, which means moist, as in Aveyron, Lod\u00e8ve, Yvette, and which you see survive in our kitchen-sinks (\u00e9viers). It is the word eau which in Breton is represented by ster, Ster-maria, Sterlaer, Sterbouest, Ster-en-Dreuchen.\u201d I heard no more, for whatever the pleasure I might feel on hearing again the name Stermaria, I could not help listening to Cottard, next to whom I was seated, as he murmured to Ski: \u201cIndeed! I was not aware of it. So he is a gentleman who has learned to look behind! He is one of the happy band, is he? He hasn\u2019t got rings of fat round his eyes, all the same. I shall have to keep my feet well under me, or he may start squeezing them. But I\u2019m not at all surprised. I am used to seeing noblemen in the bath, in their birthday suits, they are all more or less degenerates. I don\u2019t talk to them, because after all I am in an official position and it might do me harm. But they know quite well who I am.\u201d Saniette, whom Brichot\u2019s appeal had frightened, was beginning to breathe again, like a man who is afraid of the storm when he finds that the lightning has not been followed by any sound of thunder, when he heard M. Verdurin interrogate him, fastening upon him a stare which did not spare the wretch until he had finished speaking, so as to put him at once out of countenance and prevent him from recovering his composure. \u201cBut you never told us that you went to those matin\u00e9es at the Od\u00e9on, Saniette?\u201d Trembling like a recruit before a bullying serjeant, Saniette replied, making his speech as diminutive as possible, so that it might have a better chance of escaping the blow: \u201cOnly once, to the Chercheuse.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that he says?\u201d shouted M. Verdurin, with an air of disgust and fury combined, knitting his brows as though it was all he could do to grasp something unintelligible. \u201cIt is impossible to understand what you say, what have you got in your mouth?\u201d inquired M. Verdurin, growing more and more furious, and alluding to Saniette\u2019s defective speech. \u201cPoor Saniette, I won\u2019t have him made unhappy,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin in a tone of false pity, so as to leave no one in doubt as to her husband\u2019s insolent intention. \u201cI was at the Ch . . . Che..\u201d \u201cChe, che, try to speak distinctly,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201cI can\u2019t understand a word you say.\u201d Almost without exception, the faithful burst out laughing and they suggested a band of cannibals in whom the sight of a wound on a white man\u2019s skin has aroused the thirst for blood. For the instinct of imitation and absence of courage govern society and the mob alike. And we all of us laugh at a person whom we see being made fun of, which does not prevent us from venerating him ten years later in a circle where he is admired. It is in like manner that the populace banishes or acclaims its kings. \u201cCome, now, it is not his fault,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cIt is not mine either, people ought not to dine out if they can\u2019t speak properly.\u201d \u201cI was at the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit by Favart.\u201d \u201cWhat! It\u2019s theChercheuse d\u2019Esprit that you call the Chercheuse? Why, that\u2019s marvellous! I might have tried for a hundred years without guessing it,\u201d cried M. Verdurin, who all the same would have decided immediately that you were not literary, were not artistic, were not \u2018one of us,\u2019 if he had heard you quote the full title of certain works. For instance, one was expected to say the Malade, the Bourgeois; and whoso would have added imaginaire orgentilhomme would have shewn that he did not understand \u2018shop,\u2019 just as in a drawing-room a person proves that he is not in society by saying \u2018M. de Montesquiou-F\u00e9zensac\u2019 instead of \u2018M. de Montesquieu.\u2019 \u201cBut it is not so extraordinary,\u201d said Saniette, breathless with emotion but smiling, albeit he was in no smiling mood. Mme. Verdurin could not contain herself. \u201cYes, indeed!\u201d she cried with a titter. \u201cYou may be quite sure that nobody would ever have guessed that you meant the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit.\u201d M. Verdurin went on in a gentler tone, addressing both Saniette and Brichot: \u201cIt is quite a pretty piece, all the same, the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit.\u201d Uttered in a serious tone, this simple phrase, in which one could detect no trace of malice, did Saniette as much good and aroused in him as much gratitude as a deliberate compliment. He was unable to utter a single word and preserved a happy silence. Brichot was more loquacious. \u201cIt is true,\u201d he replied to M. Verdurin, \u201cand if it could be passed off as the work of some Sarmatian or Scandinavian author, we might put forward the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit as a candidate for the vacant post of masterpiece. But, be it said without any disrespect to the shade of the gentle Favart, he had not the Ibsenian temperament.\u201d (Immediately he blushed to the roots of his hair, remembering the Norwegian philosopher who appeared troubled because he was seeking in vain to discover what vegetable the buis might be that Brichot had cited a little earlier in connexion with the name Bussi\u00e8re.) \u201cHowever, now that Porel\u2019s satrapy is filled by a functionary who is a Tolstoist of rigorous observance, it may come to pass that we shall witnessAnna Karenina or Resurrection beneath the Od\u00e9onian architrave.\u201d \u201cI know the portrait of Favart to which you allude,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cI have seen a very fine print of it at Comtesse Mol\u00e9\u2018s.\u201d The name of Comtesse Mol\u00e9 made a great impression upon Mme. Verdurin. \u201cOh! So you go to Mme. de Mol\u00e9\u2018s!\u201d she exclaimed. She supposed that people said Comtesse Mol\u00e9, Madame Mol\u00e9, simply as an abbreviation, as she heard people say \u2018the Rohans\u2019 or in contempt, as she herself said: \u2018Madame la Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle.\u2019 She had no doubt that Comtesse Mol\u00e9, who knew the Queen of Greece and the Principessa di Caprarola, had as much right as anybody to the particle, and for once in a way had decided to bestow it upon so brilliant a personage, and one who had been extremely civil to herself. And so, to make it clear that she had spoken thus on purpose and did not grudge the Comtesse her \u2018de,\u2019 she went on: \u201cBut I had no idea that you knew Madame de Mol\u00e9!\u201d as though it had been doubly extraordinary, both that M. de Charlus should know the lady, and that Mme. Verdurin should not know that he knew her. Now society, or at least the people to whom M. de Charlus gave that name, forms a relatively homogeneous and compact whole. And so it is comprehensible that, in the incongruous vastness of the middle classes, a barrister may say to somebody who knows one of his school friends: \u201cBut how in the world do you come to know him?\u201d whereas to be surprised at a Frenchman\u2019s knowing the meaning of the word templeor forest would be hardly more extraordinary than to wonder at the hazards that might have brought together M. de Charlus and the Comtesse Mol\u00e9. What is more, even if such an acquaintance had not been derived quite naturally from the laws that govern society, how could there be anything strange in the fact of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s not knowing of it, since she was meeting M. de Charlus for the first time, and his relations with Mme. Mol\u00e9 were far from being the only thing that she did not know with regard to him, about whom, to tell the truth, she knew nothing. \u201cWho was it that played this Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit, my good Saniette?\u201d asked M. Verdurin. Albeit he felt that the storm had passed, the old antiquarian hesitated before answering. \u201cThere you go,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cyou frighten him, you make fun of everything that he says, and then you expect him to answer. Come along, tell us who played the part, and you shall have some galantine to take home,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, making a cruel allusion to the penury into which Saniette had plunged himself by trying to rescue the family of a friend. \u201cI can remember only that it was Mme. Samary who played the Zerbine,\u201d said Saniette. \u201cThe Zerbine? What in the world is that,\u201d M. Verdurin shouted, as though the house were on fire. \u201cIt is one of the parts in the old repertory, like Captain Fracasse, as who should say the Fire-eater, the Pedant.\u201d \u201cAh, the pedant, that\u2019s yourself. The Zerbine! No, really the man\u2019s mad,\u201d exclaimed M. Verdurin. Mme. Verdurin looked at her guests and laughed as though to apologise for Saniette. \u201cThe Zerbine, he imagines that everybody will know at once what it means. You are like M. de Longepierre, the stupidest man I know, who said to us quite calmly the other day \u2018the Banat.\u2019 Nobody had any idea what he meant. Finally we were informed that it was a province in Serbia.\u201d To put an end to Saniette\u2019s torture, which hurt me \u2018more than it hurt him, I asked Brichot if he knew what the word Balbec meant. \u201cBalbec is probably a corruption of Dalbec,\u201d he told me. \u201cOne would have to consult the charters of the Kings of England, Overlords of Normandy, for Balbec was held of the Barony of Dover, for which reason it was often styled Balbec d\u2019Outre-Mer, Balbec-en-Terre. But the Barony of Dover was itself held of the Bishopric of Bayeux, and, notwithstanding the rights that were temporarily enjoyed in the abbey by the Templars, from the time of Louis d\u2019Harcourt, Patriarch of Jerusalem and Bishop of Bayeux; it was the Bishops of that diocese who collated to the benefice of Balbec. So it was explained to me by the incumbent of Douville, a bald person, eloquent, fantastic, and a devotee of the table, who lives by the Rule of Brillat-Savarin, and who expounded to me in slightly sibylline language a loose pedagogy, while he fed me upon some admirable fried potatoes.\u201d While Brichot smiled to shew how witty it was to combine matters so dissimilar and to employ an ironically lofty diction in treating of commonplace things, Saniette was trying to find a loophole for some clever remark which would raise him from the abyss into which he had fallen. The witty remark was what was known as a \u2018comparison,\u2019 but had changed its form, for there is an evolution in wit as in literary styles, an epidemic that disappears has its place taken by another, and so forth. . . . At one time the typical \u2018comparison\u2019 was the \u2018height of. . . . \u2019 But this was out of date, no one used it any more, there was only Cottard left to say still, on occasion, in the middle of a game of piquet: \u201cDo you know what is the height of absent-mindedness, it is to think that the Edict (l\u2019edit) of Nantes was an Englishwoman.\u201d These \u2018heights\u2019 had been replaced by nicknames. In reality it was still the old \u2018comparison,\u2019 but, as the nickname was in fashion, people did not observe the survival. Unfortunately for Saniette, when these \u2018comparisons\u2019 were not his own, and as a rule were unknown to the little nucleus, he produced them so timidly that, notwithstanding the laugh with which he followed them up to indicate their humorous nature, nobody saw the point. And if on the other hand the joke was his own, as he had generally hit upon it in conversation with one of the faithful, and the latter had repeated it, appropriating the authorship, the joke was in that case known, but not as being Saniette\u2019s. And so when he slipped in one of these it was recognised, but, because he was its author, he was accused of plagiarism. \u201cVery well, then,\u201d Brichot continued, \u201cBee, in Norman, is a stream; there is the Abbey of Bee, Mobec, the stream from the marsh (Mor or Mer meant a marsh, as in Morville, or in Bricquemar, Alvimare, Cambremer), Bricquebac the stream from the high ground coming from Briga, a fortified place, as in Bricqueville, Bricquebose, le Bric, Briand, or indeed Brice, bridge, which is the same asbruck in German (Innsbruck), and as the English  which ends so many place-names (Cambridge, for instance). You have moreover in Normandy many other instances of bec: Caudebec, Bolbec, le Robec, le Bec-Hellouin, Becquerel. It is the Norman form of the German bach Offenbach, Anspach. Varaguebec, from the old word varaigne, equivalent to warren, preserved woods or ponds. As for Dal,\u201d Brichot went on, \u201cit is a form of thal, a valley: Darnetal, Rosendal, and indeed, close to Louviers, Becdal. The river that has given its name to Balbec, is, by the way, charming. Seen from a falaise (fels in German, you have indeed, not far from here, standing on a height, the picturesque town of Falaise), it runs close under the spires of the church, which is actually a long way from it, and seems to be reflecting them.\u201d \u201cI should think,\u201d said I, \u201cthat is an effect that Elstir admires greatly. I have seen several sketches of it in his studio.\u201d \u201cElstir! You know Tiche,\u201d cried Mme. Verdurin. \u201cBut do you know that we used to be the dearest friends? Thank heaven, I never see him now. No, but ask Cottard, Brichot, he used to have his place laid at my table, he came every day. Now, there\u2019s a man of whom you can say that it has done him no good to leave our little nucleus. I shall shew you presently some flowers he painted for me; you shall see the difference from the things he is doing now, which I don\u2019t care for at all, not at all! Why! I made him do me a portrait of Cottard, not to mention all the sketches he has made of me.\u201d \u201cAnd he gave the Professor purple hair,\u201d said Mme. Cottard, forgetting that at the time her husband had not been even a Fellow of the College. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Sir, whether you find that my husband has purple hair.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, raising her chin with an air of contempt for Mme. Cottard and of admiration for the man of whom she was speaking, \u201che was a brave colourist, a fine painter. Whereas,\u201d she added, turning again to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you call it painting, all those huge she-devils of composition, those vast structures he exhibits now that he has given up coming to me. For my part, I call it daubing, it\u2019s all so hackneyed, and besides, it lacks relief, personality. It\u2019s anybody\u2019s work.\u201d \u201cHe revives the grace of the eighteenth century, but in a modern form,\u201d Saniette broke out, fortified and reassured by my affability. \u201cBut I prefer Helleu.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not in the least like Helleu,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cYes, he has the fever of the eighteenth century. He\u2019s a steam Watteau,\u201d and he began to laugh. \u201cOld, old as the hills, I\u2019ve had that served up to me for years,\u201d said M. Verdurin, to whom indeed Ski had once repeated the remark, but as his own invention. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that when once in a way you say something quite amusing and make it intelligible, it is not your own.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry about it,\u201d Mme. Verdurin went on, \u201cbecause he was really gifted, he has wasted a charming temperament for painting. Ah! if he had stayed with us! Why, he would have become the greatest landscape painter of our day. And it is a woman that has dragged him down so low! Not that that surprises me, for he was a pleasant enough man, but common. At bottom, he was a mediocrity. I may tell you that I felt it at once. Really, he never interested me. I was very fond of him, that was all. For one thing, he was so dirty. Tell me, do you, now, really like people who never wash?\u201d \u201cWhat is this charmingly coloured thing that we are eating?\u201d asked Ski. \u201cIt is called strawberry mousse,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cBut it is ex-qui-site. You ought to open bottles of Ch\u00e2teau-Margaux, Ch\u00e2teau-Lafite, port wine.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how he amuses me, he never drinks anything but water,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, seeking to cloak with her delight at such a flight of fancy her alarm at the thought of so prodigal an outlay. \u201cBut not to drink,\u201d Ski went on, \u201cyou shall fill all our glasses, they will bring in marvelous peaches, huge nectarines, there against the sunset; it will be as gorgeous as a fine Veronese.\u201d \u201cIt would cost almost as much,\u201d M. Verdurin murmured. \u201cBut take away those cheeses with their hideous colour,\u201d said Ski, trying to snatch the plate from before his host, who defended his gruy\u00e8re with his might and main. \u201cYou can realise that I don\u2019t regret Elstir,\u201d Mme. Verdurin said to me, \u201cthat one is far more gifted. Elstir is simply hard work, the man who can\u2019t make himself give up painting when he would like to. He is the good student, the slavish competitor. Ski, now, only follows his own fancy. You will see him light a cigarette in the middle of dinner.\u201d \u201cAfter all, I can\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t invite his wife,\u201d said Cottard, \u201che would be with us still.\u201d \u201cWill you mind what you\u2019re saying, please, I don\u2019t open my doors to street-walkers, Monsieur le Professeur,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, who had, on the contrary, done everything in her power to make Elstir return, even with his wife. But before they were married she had tried to make them quarrel, had told Elstir that the woman he loved was stupid, dirty, immoral, a thief. For once in a way she had failed to effect a breach. It was with the Verdurin salon that Elstir had broken; and he was glad of it, as converts bless the illness or misfortune that has withdrawn them from the world and has made them learn the way of salvation. \u201cHe really is magnificent, the Professor,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy not declare outright that I keep a disorderly house? Anyone would think you didn\u2019t know what Madame Elstir was like. I would sooner have the lowest street-walker at my table! Oh no, I don\u2019t stand for that sort of thing. Besides I may tell you that it would have been stupid of me to overlook the wife, when the husband no longer interests me, he is out of date, he can\u2019t even draw.\u201d \u201cThat is extraordinary in a man of his intelligence,\u201d said Cottard. \u201cOh, no!\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, \u201ceven at the time when he had talent, for he had it, the wretch, and to spare, what was tiresome about him was that he had not a spark of intelligence.\u201d Mme. Verdurin, in passing this judgment upon Elstir, had not waited for their quarrel, or until she had ceased to care for his painting. The fact was that, even at the time when he formed part of the little group, it would happen that Elstir spent the whole day in the company of some woman whom, rightly or wrongly, Mme. Verdurin considered a goose, which, in her opinion, was not the conduct of an intelligent man. \u201cNo,\u201d she observed with an air of finality, \u201cI consider that his wife and he are made for one another. Heaven knows, there isn\u2019t a more boring creature on the face of the earth, and I should go mad if I had to spend a couple of hours with her. But people say that he finds her very intelligent. There\u2019s no use denying it, our Tiche was extremely stupid. I have seen him bowled over by people you can\u2019t conceive, worthy idiots we should never have allowed into our little clan. Well! He wrote to them, he argued with them, he, Elstir! That doesn\u2019t prevent his having charming qualities, oh, charming and deliciously absurd, naturally.\u201d For Mme. Verdurin was convinced that men who are truly remarkable are capable of all sorts of follies. A false idea in which there is nevertheless a grain of truth. Certainly, people\u2019s follies are insupportable. But a want of balance which we discover only in course of time is the consequence of the entering into a human brain of delicacies for which it is not regularly adapted. So that the oddities of charming people exasperate us, but there are few if any charming people who are not, at the same time, odd. \u201cLook, I shall be able to shew you his flowers now,\u201d she said to me, seeing that her husband was making signals to her to rise. And she took M. de Cambremer\u2019s arm again. M. Verdurin tried to apologise for this to M. de Charlus, as soon as he had got rid of Mme. de Cambremer, and to give him his reasons, chiefly for the pleasure of discussing these social refinements with a gentleman of title, momentarily the inferior of those who assigned to him the place to which they considered him entitled. But first of all he was anxious to make it clear to M. de Charlus that intellectually he esteemed him too highly to suppose that he could pay any attention to these trivialities. \u201cExcuse my mentioning so small a point,\u201d he began, \u201cfor I can understand how little such things mean to you. Middle-class minds pay attention to them, but the others, the artists, the people who are really of our sort, don\u2019t give a rap for them. Now, from the first words we exchanged, I realised that you were one of us!\u201d M. de Charlus, who gave a widely different meaning to this expression, drew himself erect. After the doctor\u2019s oglings, he found his host\u2019s insulting frankness suffocating. \u201cDon\u2019t protest, my dear Sir, you are one of us, it is plain as daylight,\u201d replied M. Verdurin. \u201cObserve that I have no idea whether you practise any of the arts, but that is not necessary. It is not always sufficient. Dechambre, who has just died, played exquisitely, with the most vigorous execution, but he was not one of us, you felt at once that he was not one of us. Brichot is not one of us. Morel is, my wife is, I can feel that you are. . . . \u201d \u201cWhat were you going to tell me?\u201d interrupted M. de Charlus, who was beginning to feel reassured as to M. Verdurin\u2019s meaning, but preferred that he should not utter these misleading remarks quite so loud. \u201cOnly that we put you on the left,\u201d replied M. Verdurin. M. de Charlus, with a comprehending, genial, insolent smile, replied: \u201cWhy! That is not of the slightest importance,here!\u201d And he gave a little laugh that was all his own \u2014 a laugh that came to him probably from some Bavarian or Lorraine grandmother, who herself had inherited it, in identical form, from an ancestress, so that it had been sounding now, without change, for not a few centuries in little old-fashioned European courts, and one could relish its precious quality like that of certain old musical instruments that have now grown rare. There are times when, to paint a complete portrait of some one, we should have to add a phonetic imitation to our verbal description, and our portrait of the figure that M. de Charlus presented is liable to remain incomplete in the absence of that little laugh, so delicate, so light, just as certain compositions are never accurately rendered because our orchestras lack those \u2018small trumpets,\u2019 with a sound so entirely their own, for which the composer wrote this or that part. \u201cBut,\u201d M. Verdurin explained, stung by his laugh, \u201cwe did it on purpose. I attach no importance whatever to title of nobility,\u201d he went on, with that contemptuous smile which I have seen so many people whom I have known, unlike my grandmother and my mother, assume when they spoke of anything that they did not possess, before others who thus, they supposed, would be prevented from using that particular advantage to crow over them. \u201cBut, don\u2019t you see, since we happened to have M. de Cambremer here, and he is a Marquis, while you are only a Baron. . . . \u201d \u201cPardon me,\u201d M. de Charlus replied with an arrogant air to the astonished Verdurin, \u201cI am also Duc de Brabant, Damoiseau de Montargis, Prince d\u2019Oloron, de Carency, de Viareggio and des Dunes. However, it is not of the slightest importance. Please do not distress yourself,\u201d he concluded, resuming his subtle smile which spread itself over these final words: \u201cI could see at a glance that you were not accustomed to society.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin came across to me to shew me Elstir\u2019s flowers. If this action, to which I had grown so indifferent, of going out to dinner, had on the contrary, taking the form that made it entirely novel, of a journey along the coast, followed by an ascent in a carriage to a point six hundred feet above the sea, produced in me a sort of intoxication, this feeling had not been dispelled at la Raspeli\u00e8re. \u201cJust look at this, now,\u201d said the Mistress, shewing me some huge and splendid roses by Elstir, whose unctuous scarlet and rich white stood out, however, with almost too creamy a relief from the flower-stand upon which they were arranged. \u201cDo you suppose he would still have to touch to get that? Don\u2019t you call that striking? And besides, it\u2019s fine as matter, it would be amusing to handle. I can\u2019t tell you how amusing it was to watch him painting them. One could feel that he was interested in trying to get just that effect.\u201d And the Mistress\u2019s gaze rested musingly on this present from the artist in which were combined not merely his great talent but their long friendship which survived only in these mementoes of it which he had bequeathed to her; behind the flowers which long agcr he had picked for her, she seemed to see the shapely hand that had painted them, in the course of a morning, in their freshness, so that, they on the table, it leaning against the back of a chair, had been able to meet face to face at the Mistress\u2019s luncheon party, the roses still alive and their almost lifelike portrait. Almost only, for Elstir was unable to look at a flower without first transplanting it to that inner garden in which we are obliged always to remain. He had shewn in this water-colour the appearance of the roses which he had seen, and which, but for him, no one would ever have known; so that one might say that they were a new variety with which this painter, like a skilful gardener, had enriched the family of the Roses. \u201cFrom the day he left the little nucleus, he was finished. It seems, my dinners made him waste his time, that I hindered the development of his genius,\u201d she said in a tone of irony. \u201cAs if the society of a woman like myself could fail to be beneficial to an artist,\u201d she exclaimed with a burst of pride. Close beside us, M. de Cambremer, who was already seated, seeing that M. de Charlus was standing, made as though to rise and offer him his chair. This offer may have arisen, in the Marquis\u2019s mind, from nothing more than a vague wish to be polite. M. de Charlus preferred to attach to it the sense of a duty which the plain gentleman knew that he owed to a Prince, and felt that he could not establish his right to this precedence better than by declining it. And so he exclaimed: \u201cWhat are you doing? I beg of you! The idea!\u201d The astutely vehement tone of this protest had in itself something typically \u2018Guermantes\u2019 which became even more evident in the imperative, superfluous and familiar gesture with which he brought both his hands down, as though to force him to remain seated, upon the shoulders of M. de Cambremer who had not risen. \u201cCome, come, my dear fellow,\u201d the Baron insisted, \u201cthis is too much. There is no reason for it! In these days we keep that for Princes of the Blood.\u201d I made no more effect on the Cambremers than on Mme. Verdurin by my enthusiasm for their house. For I remained cold to the beauties which they pointed out to me and grew excited over confused reminiscences; at times I even confessed my disappointment at not finding something correspond to what its name had made me imagine. I enraged Mme. de Cambremer by telling her that I had supposed the place to be more in the country. On the other hand I broke off in an ecstasy to sniff the fragrance of a breeze that crept in through the chink of the door. \u201cI see you like draughts,\u201d they said to me. My praise of the patch of green lining-cloth that had been pasted over a broken pane met with no greater success: \u201cHow frightful!\u201d cried the Marquise. The climax came when I said: \u201cMy greatest joy was when I arrived. When I heard my step echoing along the gallery, I felt that I had come into some village council-office, with a map of the district on the wall.\u201d This time, Mme. de Cambremer resolutely turned her back on me. \u201cYou don\u2019t think the arrangement too bad?\u201d her husband asked her with the same compassionate anxiety with which he would have inquired how his wife had stood some painful ceremony. \u201cThey have some fine things.\u201d But, inasmuch as malice, when the hard and fast rules of sure taste do not confine it within fixed limits, finds fault with everything, in the persons or in the houses, of the people who have supplanted the critic: \u201cYes, but they are not in the right places. Besides, are they really as fine as all that?\u201d \u201cYou noticed,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, with a melancholy that was controlled by a note of firmness, \u201cthere are some Jouy hangings that are worn away, some quite threadbare things in this drawing-room!\u201d \u201cAnd that piece of stuff with its huge roses, like a peasant woman\u2019s quilt,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer whose purely artificial culture was confined exclusively to idealist philosophy, impressionist painting and Debussy\u2019s music. And, so as not to criticise merely in the name of smartness but in that of good taste: \u201cAnd they have put up windscreens! Such bad style! What can you expect of such people, they don\u2019t know, where could they have learned? They must be retired tradespeople. It\u2019s really not bad for them.\u201d \u201cI thought the chandeliers good,\u201d said the Marquis, though it was not evident why he should make an exception of the chandeliers, just as inevitably, whenever anyone spoke of a church, whether it was the Cathedral of Chartres, or of Rheims, or of Amiens, or the church at Balbec, what he would always make a point of mentioning as admirable would be: \u201cthe organ-loft, the pulpit and the misericords.\u201d \u201cAs for the garden, don\u2019t speak about it,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer. \u201cIt\u2019s a massacre. Those paths running all crooked.\u201d I seized the opportunity while Mme. Verdurin was pouring out coffee to go and glance over the letter which M. de Cambremer had brought me, and in which his mother invited me to dinner. With that faint trace of ink, the handwriting revealed an individuality which in the future I should be able to recognise among a thousand, without any more need to have recourse to the hypothesis of special pens, than to suppose that rare and mysteriously blended colours are necessary to enable a painter to express his original vision. Indeed a paralytic, stricken with agraphia after a seizure, and compelled to look at the script as at a drawing without being able to read it, would have gathered that Mme. de Cambremer belonged to an old family in which the zealous cultivation of literature and the arts had supplied a margin to its artistocratic traditions. He would have guessed also the period in which the Marquise had learned simultaneously to write and to play Chopin\u2019s music. It was the time when well-bred people observed the rule of affability and what was called the rule of the three adjectives. Mme. de Cambremer combined the two rules in one. A laudatory adjective was not enough for her, she followed it (after a little stroke of the pen) with a second, then (after another stroke), with a third. But, what was peculiar to herself was that, in defiance of the literary and social object at which she aimed, the sequence of the three epithets assumed in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s notes the aspect not of a progression but of a diminuendo. Mme. de Cambremer told me in this first letter that she had seen Saint-Loup and had appreciated more than ever his \u2018unique \u2014 rare \u2014 real\u2019 qualities, that he was coming to them again with one of his friends (the one who was in love with her daughter-in-law), and that if I cared to come, with or without them, to dine at F\u00e9terne she would be \u2018delighted \u2014 happy \u2014 pleased.\u2019 Perhaps it was because her desire to be friendly outran the fertility of her imagination and the riches of her vocabulary that the lady, while determined to utter three exclamations, was incapable of making the second and third anything more than feeble echoes of the first. Add but a fourth adjective, and, of her initial friendliness, there would be nothing left. Moreover, with a certain refined simplicity which cannot have failed to produce a considerable impression upon her family and indeed in her circle of acquaintance, Mme. de Cambremer had acquired the habit of substituting for the word (which might in time begin to ring false) \u2018sincere,\u2019 the word \u2018true.\u2019 And to shew that it was indeed by sincerity that she was impelled, she broke the conventional rule that would have placed the adjective \u2018true\u2019 before its noun, and planted it boldly after. Her letters ended with: \u201cCroyez \u00e0 mon amiti\u00e9 vraie.\u201d \u201cCroyez \u00e0 ma sympathie vraie.\u201d Unfortunately, this had become so stereotyped a formula that the affectation of frankness was more suggestive of a polite fiction than the time-honoured formulas, of the meaning of which people have ceased to think. I was, however, hindered from reading her letter by the confused sound of conversation over which rang out the louder accents of M. de Charlus, who, still on the same topic, was saying to M. de Cambremer: \u201cYou reminded me, when you offered me your chair, of a gentleman from whom I received a letter this morning, addressed: \u2018To His Highness, the Baron de Charlus,\u2019 and beginning \u2018Monseigneur.\u2019\u201d \u201cTo be sure, your correspondent was slightly exaggerating,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer, giving way to a discreet show of mirth. M. de Charlus had provoked this; he did not partake in it. \u201cWell, if it comes to that, my dear fellow,\u201d he said, \u201cI may observe that, heraldically speaking, he was entirely in the right. I am not regarding it as a personal matter, you understand. I should say the same of anyone else. But one has to face the facts, history is history, we can\u2019t alter it and it is not in our power to rewrite it. I need not cite the case of the Emperor William, who at Kiel never ceased to address me as \u2018Monseigneur.\u2019 I have heard it said that he gave the same title to all the Dukes of France, which was an abuse of the privilege, but was perhaps simply a delicate attention aimed over our heads at France herself.\u201d \u201cMore delicate, perhaps, than sincere,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cAh! There I must differ from you. Observe that, personally, a gentleman of the lowest rank such as that Hohenzollern, a Protestant to boot, and one who has usurped the throne of my cousin the King of Hanover, can be no favourite of mine,\u201d added M. de Charlus, with whom the annexation of Hanover seemed to rankle more than that of Alsace-Lorraine. \u201cBut I believe the feeling that turns the Emperor in our direction to be profoundly sincere. Fools will tell you that he is a stage emperor. He is on the contrary marvellously intelligent; it is true that he knows nothing about painting, and has forced Herr Tschudi to withdraw the Elstirs from the public galleries. But Louis XIV did not appreciate the Dutch Masters, he had the same fondness for display, and yet he was, when all is said, a great Monarch. Besides, William II has armed his country from the military and naval point of view in a way that Louis XIV failed to do, and I hope that his reign will never know the reverses that darkened the closing days of him who is fatuously styled the Roi Soleil. The Republic made a great mistake, to my mind, in rejecting the overtures of the Hohenzollern, or responding to them only in driblets. He is very well aware of it himself and says, with that gift that he has for the right expression: \u2018What I want is a clasped hand, not a raised hat.\u2019 As a man, he is vile; he has abandoned, surrendered, denied his best friends, in circumstances in which his silence was as deplorable as theirs was grand,\u201d continued M. de Charlus, who was irresistibly drawn by his own tendencies to the Eulenburg affair, and remembered what one of the most highly placed of the culprits had said to him: \u201cThe Emperor must have relied upon our delicacy to have dared to allow such a trial. But he was not mistaken in trusting to our discretion. We would have gone to the scaffold with our lips sealed.\u201d \u201cAll that, however, has nothing to do with what I was trying to explain, which is that, in Germany, mediatised Princes like ourselves are Durchlaucht, and in France our rank of Highness was publicly recognised. Saint-Simon tries to make out that this was an abuse on our part, in which he is entirely mistaken. The reason that he gives, namely that Louis XIV forbade us to style him the Most Christian King and ordered us to call him simply the King, proves merely that we held our title from him, and not that we had not the rank of Prince. Otherwise, it would have to be withheld from the Duc de Lorraine and ever so many others. Besides, several of our titles come from the House of Lorraine through Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d\u2019Espinay, my great-grandmother, who was the daughter of the Damoiseau de Commercy.\u201d Observing that Morel was listening, M. de Charlus proceeded to develop the reasons for his claim. \u201cI have pointed out to my brother that it is not in the third part of Gotha, but in the second, not to say the first, that the account of our family ought to be included,\u201d he said, without stopping to think that Morel did not know what \u2018Gotha\u2019 was. \u201cBut that is his affair, he is the Head of my House, and so long as he raises no objection and allows the matter to pass, I have only to shut my eyes.\u201d \u201cM. Brichot interests me greatly,\u201d I said to Mme. Verdurin as she joined me, and I slipped Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s letter into my pocket. \u201cHe has a cultured mind and is an excellent man,\u201d she replied coldly. \u201cOf course what he lacks is originality and taste, he has a terrible memory. They used to say of the \u2018forebears\u2019 of the people we have here this evening, the \u00e9migr\u00e9s, that they had forgotten nothing. But they had at least the excuse,\u201d she said, borrowing one of Swann\u2019s epigrams, \u201cthat they had learned nothing. Whereas Brichot knows everything, and hurls chunks of dictionary at our heads during dinner. I\u2019m sure you know everything now about the names of all the towns and villages.\u201d While Mme. Verdurin was speaking, it occurred to me that I had determined to ask her something, but I could not remember what it was. I could not at this moment say what Mme. Verdurin was wearing that evening. Perhaps even then I was no more able to say, for I have not an observant mind. But feeling that her dress was not unambitious I said to her something polite and even admiring. She was like almost all women, who imagine that a compliment that is paid to them is a literal statement of the truth, and is a judgment impartially, irresistibly pronounced, as though it referred to a work of art that has no connexion with a person. And so it was with an earnestness which made me blush for my own hypocrisy that she replied with the proud and artless question, habitual in the circumstances: \u201cYou like it?\u201d \u201cI know you\u2019re talking about Brichot. Eh, Chantepie, Freycinet, he spared you nothing. I had my eye on you, my little Mistress!\u201d \u201cI saw you, it was all I could do not to laugh.\u201d \u201cYou are talking about Chantepie, I am certain,\u201d said M. Verdurin, as he came towards us. I had been alone, as I thought of my strip of green cloth and of a scent of wood, in failing to notice that, while he discussed etymologies, Brichot had been provoking derision. And inasmuch as the expressions which, for me, gave their value to things were of the sort which other people either do not feel or reject without thinking of them, as unimportant, they were entirely useless to me and had the additional drawback of making me appear stupid in the eyes of Mme. Verdurin who saw that I had \u2018swallowed\u2019 Brichot, as before I had appeared stupid to Mme. de Guermantes, because I enjoyed going to see Mme. d\u2019Arpajon. With Brichot, however, there was another reason. I was not one of the little clan. And in every clan, whether it be social, political, literary, one contracts a perverse facility in discovering in a conversation, in an official speech, in a story, in a sonnet, everything that the honest reader would never have dreamed of finding there. How many times have I found myself, after reading with a certain emotion a tale skilfully told by a learned and slightly old-fashioned Academician, on the point of saying to Bloch or to Mme. de Guermantes: \u201cHow charming this is!\u201d when before I had opened my mouth they exclaimed, each in a different language: \u201cIf you want to be really amused, read a tale by So-and-so. Human stupidity has never sunk to greater depths.\u201d Bloch\u2019s scorn was aroused principally by the discovery that certain effects of style, pleasant enough in themselves, were slightly faded; that of Mme. de Guermantes because the tale seemed to prove the direct opposite of what the author meant, for reasons of fact which she had the ingenuity to deduce but which would never have occurred to me. I was no less surprised to discover the irony that underlay the Verdurins\u2019 apparent friendliness for Brichot than to hear, some days later, at F\u00e9terne, the Cambremers say to me, on hearing my enthusiastic praise of la Raspeli\u00e8re: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that you can be sincere, after all they\u2019ve done to it.\u201d It is true that they admitted that the china was good. Like the shocking windscreens, it had escaped my notice. \u201cAnyhow, when you go back to Balbec, you will know what Balbec means,\u201d said M. Verdurin ironically. It was precisely the things Brichot had told me that interested me. As for what they called his mind, it was exactly the same mind that had at one time been so highly appreciated by the little clan. He talked with the same irritating fluency, but his words no longer carried, having to overcome a hostile silence or disagreeable echoes; what had altered was not the things that he said but the acoustics of the room and the attitude of his audience. \u201cTake care,\u201d Mme. Verdurin murmured, pointing to Brichot. The latter, whose hearing remained keener than his vision, darted at the mistress the hastily withdrawn gaze of a short-sighted philosopher. If his bodily eyes were less good, his mind\u2019s eye on the contrary had begun to take a larger view of things. He saw how little was to be expected of human affection, and resigned himself to it. Undoubtedly the discovery pained him. It may happen that even the man who on one evening only, in a circle where he is usually greeted with joy, realises that the others have found him too frivolous or too pedantic or too loud, or too forward, or whatever it may be, returns home miserable. Often it is a difference of opinion, or of system, that has made him appear to other people absurd or old-fashioned. Often he is perfectly well aware that those others are inferior to himself. He could easily dissect the sophistries with which he has been tacitly condemned, he is tempted to pay a call, to write a letter: on second thoughts, he does nothing, awaits the invitation for the following week. Sometimes, too, these discomfitures, instead of ending with the evening, last for months. Arising from the instability of social judgments, they increase that instability further. For the man who knows that Mme. X despises him, feeling that he is respected at Mme. Y\u2019s, pronounces her far superior to the other and emigrates to her house. This however is not the proper place to describe those men, superior to the life of society but lacking the capacity to realise their own worth outside it, glad to be invited, embittered by being disparaged, discovering annually the faults of the hostess to whom they have been offering incense and the genius of her whom they have never properly appreciated, ready to return to the old love when they shall have felt the drawbacks to be found equally in the new, and when they have begun to forget those of the old. We may judge by these temporary discomfitures the grief that Brichot felt at one which he knew to be final. He was not unaware that Mme. Verdurin sometimes laughed at him publicly, even at his infirmities, and knowing how little was to be expected of human affection, submitting himself to the facts, he continued nevertheless to regard the Mistress as his best friend. But, from the blush that swept over the scholar\u2019s face, Mme. Verdurin saw that he had heard her, and made up her mind to be kind to him for the rest of the evening. I could not help remarking to her that she had not been very kind to Saniette. \u201cWhat! Not kind to him! Why, he adores us, you can\u2019t imagine what we are to him. My husband is sometimes a little irritated by his stupidity, and you must admit that he has every reason, but when that happens why doesn\u2019t he rise in revolt, instead of cringing like a whipped dog? It is not honest. I don\u2019t like it. That doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t always try to calm my husband, because if he went too far, all that would happen would be that Saniette would stay away; and I don\u2019t want that because I may tell you that he hasn\u2019t a penny in the world, he needs his dinners. But after all, if he does mind, he can stay away, it has nothing to do with me, when a person depends on other people he should try not to be such an idiot.\u201d \u201cThe Duchy of Aumale was in our family for years before passing to the House of France,\u201d M. de Charlus was explaining to M. de Cambremer, before a speechless Morel, for whom, as a matter of fact, the whole of this dissertation was, if not actually addressed to him, intended. \u201cWe took precedence over all foreign Princes; I could give you a hundred examples. The Princesse de Croy having attempted, at the burial of Monsieur, to fall on her knees after my great-great-grandmother, that lady reminded her sharply that she had not the privilege of the hassock, made the officer on duty remove it, and reported the matter to the King, who ordered Mme. de Croy to call upon Mme. de Guermantes and offer her apologies. The Duc de Bourgogne having come to us with ushers with raised wands, we obtained the King\u2019s authority to have them lowered. I know it is not good form to speak of the merits of one\u2019s own family. But it is well known that our people were always to the fore in the hour of danger. Our battle-cry, after we abandoned that of the Dukes of Brabant, was Passavant! So that it is fair enough after all that this right to be everywhere the first, which we had established for so many centuries in war, should afterwards have been confirmed to us at Court. And, egad, it has always been admitted there. I may give you a further instance, that of the Princess of Baden. As she had so far forgotten herself as to attempt to challenge the precedence of that same Duchesse de Guermantes of whom I was speaking just now, and had attempted to go in first to the King\u2019s presence, taking advantage of a momentary hesitation which my relative may perhaps have shewn (although there could be no reason for it), the King called out: \u2018Come in, cousin, come in; Mme. de Baden knows very well what her duty is to you.\u2019 And it was as Duchesse de Guermantes that she held this rank, albeit she was of no mean family herself, since she was through her mother niece to the Queen of Poland, the Queen of Hungary, the Elector Palatine, the Prince of Savoy-Carignano and the Elector of Hanover, afterwards King of England.\u201d \u201cMaecenas atavis \u00e9dite regibus!\u201d said Brichot, addressing M. de Charlus, who acknowledged the compliment with a slight inclination of his head. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Mme. Verdurin asked Brichot, anxious to make amends to him for her previous speech. \u201cI was referring, Heaven forgive me, to a dandy who was the pick of the basket\u201d (Mme. Verdurin winced) \u201cabout the time of Augustus\u201d (Mme. Verdurin, reassured by the remoteness in time of this basket, assumed a more serene expression), \u201cof a friend of Virgil and Horace who carried their sycophancy to the extent of proclaiming to his face his more than aristocratic, his royal descent, in a word I was referring to Maecenas, a bookworm who was the friend of Horace, Virgil, Augustus. I am sure that M. de Charlus knows all about Maecenas.\u201d With a gracious, sidelong glance at Mme. Verdurin, because he had heard her make an appointment with Morel for the day after next and was afraid that she might not invite him also, \u201cI should say,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cthat Maecenas was more or less the Verdurin of antiquity.\u201d Mme. Verdurin could not altogether suppress a smile of satisfaction. She went over to Morel. \u201cHe\u2019s nice, your father\u2019s friend,\u201d she said to him. \u201cOne can see that he\u2019s an educated man, and well bred. He will get on well in our little nucleus. What is his address in Paris?\u201d Morel preserved a haughty silence and merely proposed a game of cards. Mme. Verdurin insisted upon a little violin music first. To the general astonishment, M. de Charlus, who never referred to his own considerable gifts, accompanied, in the purest style, the closing passage (uneasy, tormented, Schumannesque, but, for all that, earlier than Franck\u2019s Sonata) of the Sonata for piano and violin by Faur\u00e9. I felt that he would furnish Morel, marvellously endowed as to tone and virtuosity, with just those qualities that he lacked, culture and style. But I thought with curiosity of this combination in a single person of a physical blemish and a spiritual gift. M. de Charlus was not very different from his brother, the Duc de Guermantes. Indeed, a moment ago (though this was rare), he had spoken as bad French as his brother. He having reproached me (doubtless in order that I might speak in glowing terms of Morel to Mme. Verdurin) with never coming to see him, and I having pleaded discretion, he had replied: \u201cBut, since it is I that asks you, there is no one but I who am in a position to take offence.\u201d This might have been said by the Duc de Guermantes. M. de Charlus was only a Guermantes when all was said. But it had been enough that nature should upset the balance of his nervous system sufficiently to make him prefer to the woman that his brother the Duke would have chosen one of Virgil\u2019s shepherds or Plato\u2019s disciples, and at once qualities unknown to the Duc de Guermantes and often combined with this want of balance had made M. de Charlus an exquisite pianist, an amateur painter who was not devoid of taste, an eloquent talker. Who would ever have detected that the rapid, eager, charming style with which M. de Charlus played the Schumannesque passage of Faur\u00e9\u2018s Sonata had its equivalent \u2014 one dares not say its cause \u2014 in elements entirely physical, in the nervous defects of M. de Charlus? We shall explain later on what we mean by nervous defects, and why it is that a Greek of the time of Socrates, a Roman of the time of Augustus might be what we know them to have been and yet remain absolutely normal men, and not men-women such as we see around us to-day. Just as he had genuine artistic tendencies, which had never come to fruition, so M. de Charlus had, far more than the Duke, loved their mother, loved his own wife, and indeed, years after her death, if anyone spoke of her to him would shed tears, but superficial tears, like the perspiration of an over-stout man, whose brow will glisten with sweat at the slightest exertion. With this difference, that to the latter we say: \u201cHow hot you are,\u201d whereas we pretend not to notice other people\u2019s tears. We, that is to say, people in society; for the humbler sort are as distressed by the sight of tears as if a sob were more serious than a hemorrhage. His sorrow after the death of his wife, thanks to the habit of falsehood, did not debar M. de Charlus from a life which was not in harmony \u2022with it. Indeed later on, he sank so low as to let it be known that, during the funeral rites, he had found an opportunity of asking the acolyte for his name and address. And it may have been true\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the piece eame to an end, I ventured to ask for some Franck, which appeared to cause Mme. de Cambremer such acute pain that I did not insist. \u201cYou can\u2019t admire that sort of thing,\u201d she said to me. Instead she asked for Debussy\u2019s F\u00eates, which made her exclaim: \u201cAh! How sublime!\u201d from the first note. But Morel discovered that he remembered the opening bars only, and in a spirit of mischief, without any intention to deceive, began a March by Meyerbeer. Unfortunately, as he left little interval and made no announcement, everybody supposed that he was still playing Debussy, and continued to exclaim \u2018Sublime!\u2019 Morel, by revealing that the composer was that not of Pell\u00e9as but of Robert le Diable created a certain chill. Mme. de Cambremer had scarcely time to feel it, for she had just discovered a volume of Scarlatti, and had flung herself upon it with an hysterical impulse. \u201cOh! Play this, look, this piece, it\u2019s divine,\u201d she cried. And yet, of this composer long despised, recently ^promoted to the highest honours, what she had selected in her feverish impatience was one of those infernal pieces which have so often kept us from sleeping, while a merciless pupil repeats them indefinitely on the next floor. But Morel had had enough music, and as he insisted upon cards, M. de Charlus, to be able to join in, proposed a game of whist. \u201cHe was telling the Master just now that he is a Prince,\u201d said Ski to Mme. Verdurin, \u201cbut it\u2019s not true, they\u2019re quite a humble family of architects.\u201d \u201cI want to know what it was you were saying about Maecenas. It interests me, don\u2019t you know!\u201d Mme. Verdurin repeated to Brichot, with an affability that carried him off his feet. And so, in order to shine in the Mistress\u2019s eyes, and possibly in mine: \u201cWhy, to tell you the truth, Madame, Maecenas interests me chiefly because he is the earliest apostle of note of that Chinese god who numbers more followers in France to-day than Brahma, than Christ himself, the all-powerful God Ubedamd.\u201d Mme. Verdurin was no longer content, upon these occasions, with burying her head in her hands. She would descend with the suddenness of the insects called ephemeral upon Princess Sherbatoff; were the latter within reach the Mistress would cling to her shoulder, dig her nails into it, and hide her face against it for a few moments like a child playing at hide and seek. Concealed by this protecting screen, she was understood to be laughing until she cried and was as well able to think of nothing at all as people are who while saying a prayer that is rather long take the wise precaution of burying their faces in their hands. Mme. Verdurin used to imitate them when she listened to Beethoven quartets, so as at the same time to let it be seen that she regarded them as a prayer and not to let it be seen that she was asleep. \u201cI am quite serious, Madame,\u201d said Brichot. \u201cToo numerous, I consider, to-day is become the person who spends his time gazing at his navel as though it were the hub of the universe. As a matter of doctrine, I have no objection to offer to some Nirvana which will dissolve us in the great Whole (which, like Munich and Oxford, is considerably nearer to Paris than Asni\u00e8res or Bois-Colombes), but it is unworthy either of a true Frenchman, or of a true European even, when the Japanese are possibly at the gates of our Byzantium, that socialised anti-militarists should be gravely discussing the cardinal virtues of free verse.\u201d Mme. Verdurin felt that she might dispense with the Princess\u2019s mangled shoulder, and allowed her face to become once more visible, not without pretending to wipe her eyes and gasping two or three times for breath. But Brichot was determined that I should have my share in the entertainment, and having learned, from those oral examinations which he conducted so admirably, that the best way to flatter the young is to lecture them, to make them feel themselves important, to make them regard you as a reactionary: \u201cI have no wish to blaspheme against the Gods of Youth,\u201d he said, with that furtive glance at myself which a speaker turns upon a member of his audience whom he has mentioned by name. \u201cI have no wish to be damned as a heretic and renegade in the Mallarm\u00e9an chapel in which our new friend, like all the young men of his age, must have served the esoteric mass, at least as an acolyte, and have shewn himself deliquescent or Rosicrucian. But, really, we have seen more than enough of these intellectuals worshipping art with a big A, who, when they can no longer intoxicate themselves upon Zola, inject themselves with Verlaine. Become etheromaniacs out of Baude-lairean devotion, they would no longer be capable of the virile effort which the country may, one day or another, demand of them, anaesthetised as they are by the great literary neurosis in the heated, enervating atmosphere, heavy with unwholesome vapours, of a symbolism of the opium-pipe.\u201d Feeling incapable of feigning any trace of admiration for Brichot\u2019s inept and motley tirade, I turned to Ski and assured him that he was entirely mistaken as to the family to which M. de Charlus belonged; he replied that he was certain of his facts, and added that I myself had said that his real name was Gandin, Le Gandin. \u201cI told you,\u201d was my answer, \u201cthat Mme. de Cambremer was the sister of an engineer, M. Legrandin. I never said a word to you about M. de Charlus. There is about as much connexion between him and Mme. de Cambremer as between the Great Cond\u00e9 and Racine.\u201d \u201cIndeed! I thought there was,\u201d said Ski lightly, with no more apology for his mistake than he had made a few hours earlier for the mistake that had nearly made his party miss the train. \u201cDo you intend to remain long on this coast?\u201d Mme. Verdurin asked M. de Charlus, in whom she foresaw an addition to the faithful and trembled lest he should be returning too soon to Paris. \u201cGood Lord, one never knows,\u201d replied M. de Charlus in a nasal drawl. \u201cI should like to stay here until the end of September.\u201d \u201cYou are quite right,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin; \u201cthat is the time for fine storms at sea.\u201d \u201cTo tell you the truth, that is not what would influence me. I have for some time past unduly neglected the Archangel Saint Michael, my patron, and I should like to make amends to him by staying for his feast, on the 29th of September, at the Abbey on the Mount.\u201d \u201cYou take an interest in all that sort of thing?\u201d asked Mme. Verdurin, who might perhaps have succeeded in hushing the voice of her outraged anti-clericalism, had she not been afraid that so long an expedition might make the violinist and the Baron \u2018fail\u2019 her for forty-eight hours. \u201cYou are perhaps afflicted with intermittent deafness,\u201d M. de Charlus replied insolently. \u201cI have told you that Saint Michael is one of my glorious patrons.\u201d Then, smiling with a benevolent ecstasy, his eyes gazing into the distance, his voice strengthened by an excitement which seemed now to be not merely aesthetic but religious: \u201cIt is so beautiful at the offertory when Michael stands erect by the altar, in a white robe, swinging a golden censer heaped so high with perfumes that the fragrance of them mounts up to God.\u201d \u201cWe might go there in a party,\u201d suggested Mme. Verdurin, notwithstanding her horror of the clergy. \u201cAt that moment, when the offertory begins,\u201d went on M. de Charlus who, for other reasons but in the same manner as good speakers in Parliament, never replied to an interruption and would pretend not to have heard it, \u201cit would be wonderful to see our young friend Palestrinising, indeed performing an aria by Bach. The worthy Abbot, too, would be wild with joy, and that is the greatest homage, at least the greatest public homage that I can pay to my Holy Patron. What an edification for the faithful! We must mention it presently to the young Angelico of music, a warrior like Saint Michael.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saniette, summoned to make a fourth, declared that he did not know how to play whist. And Cottard, seeing that there was not much time left before our train, embarked at once on a game of \u00e9cart\u00e9 with Morel. M. Verdurin was furious, and bore down with a terrible expression upon Saniette. \u201cIs there anything in the world that you can play?\u201d he cried, furious at being deprived of the opportunity for a game of whist, and delighted to have found one to insult the old registrar. He, in his terror, did his best to look clever. \u201cYes, I can play the piano,\u201d he said. Cottard and Morel were seated face to face. \u201cYour deal,\u201d said Cottard. \u201cSuppose we go nearer to the card-table,\u201d M. de Charlus, worried by the sight of Morel in Cottard\u2019s company, suggested to M. de Cambremer. \u201cIt is quite as interesting as those questions of etiquette which in these days have ceased to count for very much. The only kings that we have left, in France at least, are the kings in the pack of cards, who seem to me to be positively swarming in the hand of our young virtuoso,\u201d he added a moment later, from an admiration for Morel which extended to his way of playing cards, to flatter him also, and finally to account for his suddenly turning to lean over the young violinist\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI-ee cut,\u201d said (imitating the accent of a cardsharper) Cottard, whose children burst out laughing, like his students and the chief dresser, whenever the master, even by the bedside of a serious case, uttered with the emotionless face of an epileptic one of his hackneyed witticisms. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to play,\u201d said Morel, seeking advice from M. de Charlus. \u201cJust as you please, you\u2019re bound to lose, whatever you play, it\u2019s all the same (c\u2019est \u00e9gal).\u201d \u201cEgal . . . Ingalli?\u201d said the doctor, with an insinuating, kindly glance at M. de Cambremer. \u201cShe was what we call a true diva, she was a dream, a Carmen such as we shall never see again. She was wedded to the part. I used to enjoy too listening to Ingalli \u2014 married.\u201d The Marquis drew himself up with that contemptuous vulgarity of well-bred people who do not realise that they are insulting their host by appearing uncertain whether they ought to associate with his guests, and adopt English manners by way of apology for a scornful expression: \u201cWho is that gentleman playing cards, what does he do for a living, what does he sell? I rather like to know whom I am meeting, so as not to make friends with any Tom, Dick or Harry. But I didn\u2019t catch his name when you did me the honour of introducing me to him.\u201d If M. Verdurin, availing himself of this phrase, had indeed introduced M. de Cambremer to his fellow-guests, the other would have been greatly annoyed. But, knowing that it was the opposite procedure that was observed, he thought it gracious to assume a genial and modest air, without risk to himself. The pride that M. Verdurin took in his intimacy with Cottard had increased if anything now that the doctor had become an eminent professor. But it no longer found expression in the artless language of earlier days. Then, when Cottard was scarcely known to the public, if you spoke to M. Verdurin of his wife\u2019s facial neuralgia: \u201cThere is nothing to be done,\u201d he would say, with the artless self-satisfaction of people who assume that anyone whom they know must be famous, and that everybody knows the name of their family singing-master. \u201cIf she had an ordinary doctor, one might look for a second opinion, but when that doctor is called Cottard\u201d (a name which he pronounced as though it were Bouchard or Charcot) \u201cone has simply to bow to the inevitable.\u201d Adopting a reverse procedure, knowing that M. de Cambremer must certainly have heard of the famous Professor Cottard, M. Verdurin adopted a tone of simplicity. \u201cHe\u2019s our family doctor, a worthy soul whom we adore and who would let himself be torn in pieces for our sakes; he is not a doctor, he is a friend, I don\u2019t suppose you have ever heard of him or that his name would convey anything to you, in any case to us it is the name of a very good man, of a very dear friend, Cottard.\u201d This name, murmured in a modest tone, took in M. de Cambremer who supposed that his host was referring to some one else. \u201cCottard? You don\u2019t mean Professor Cottard?\u201d At that moment one heard the voice of the said Professor who, at an awkward point in the game, was saying as he looked at his cards: \u201cThis is where Greek meets Greek.\u201d \u201cWhy, yes, to be sure, he is a professor,\u201d said M. Verdurin. \u201cWhat! Professor Cottard! You are not making a mistake?-You are quite sure it\u2019s the same man? The one who lives in the Rue du Bac?\u201d \u201cYes, his address is 43, Rue du Bac. You know him?\u201d \u201cBut everybody knows Professor Cottard. He\u2019s at the top of the tree! You might as well ask me if I knew Bouffe de Saint-Biaise or Courtois-Suffit. I could see when I heard him speak that he was not an ordinary person, that is why I took the liberty of asking you.\u201d \u201cCome now, what shall I play, trumps?\u201d asked Cottard. Then abruptly, with a vulgarity which would have been offensive even in heroic circumstances, as when a soldier uses a coarse expression to convey his contempt for death, but became doubly stupid in the safe pastime of a game of cards, Cottard, deciding to play a trump, assumed a sombre, suicidal air, and, borrowing the language of people who are risking their skins, played his card as though it were his life, with the exclamation: \u201cThere it is, and be damned to it!\u201d It was not the right card to play, but he had a consolation. In the middle of the room, in a deep armchair, Mme. Cottard, yielding to the effect, which she always found irresistible, of a good dinner, had succumbed after vain efforts to the vast and gentle slumbers that were overpowering her. In vain might she sit up now and again, and smile, whether at her own absurdity or from fear of leaving unanswered some polite speech that might have been addressed to her, she sank back, in spite of herself, into the clutches of the implacable and delicious malady. More than the noise, what awakened her thus for an instant only, was the giance (which, in her wifely affection she could see even when her eyes were shut, and foresaw, for the same scene occurred every evening and haunted her dreams like the thought of the hour at which one will have to rise), the glance with which the Professor drew the attention of those present to his wife\u2019s slumbers. To begin with, he merely looked at her and smiled, for if as a doctor he disapproved of this habit of falling asleep after dinner (or at least gave this scientific reason for growing annoyed later on, but it is not certain whether it was a determining reason, so many and diverse were the views that he held about it), as an all-powerful and teasing husband, he was delighted to be able to make a fool of his wife, to rouse her only partly at first, so that she might fall asleep again and he have the pleasure of waking her afresh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this time, Mme. Cottard was sound asleep. \u201cNow then, L\u00e9ontine you\u2019re snoring,\u201d the professor called to her. \u201cI am listening to Mme. Swann, my dear,\u201d Mme. Cottard replied faintly, and dropped back into her lethargy. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect nonsense,\u201d exclaimed Cottard, \u201cshe\u2019ll be telling us presently that she wasn\u2019t asleep. She\u2019s like the patients who come to consult us and insist that they never sleep at all.\u201d \u201cThey imagine it, perhaps,\u201d said M. de Cambremer with a laugh. But the doctor enjoyed contradicting no less than teasing, and would on no account allow a layman to talk medicine to him. \u201cPeople do not imagine that they never sleep,\u201d he promulgated in a dogmatic tone. \u201cAh!\u201d replied the Marquis with a respectful bow, such as Cottard at one time would have made. \u201cIt is easy to see,\u201d Cottard went on, \u201cthat you have never administered, as I have, as much as two grains of trional without succeeding in provoking som-nolescence.\u201d \u201cQuite so, quite so,\u201d replied the Marquis, laughing with a superior air, \u201cI have never taken trional, or any of those drugs which soon cease to have any effect but ruin your stomach. When a man has been out shooting all night, like me, in the forest of Chantepie, I can assure you he doesn\u2019t need any trional to make him sleep.\u201d \u201cIt is only fools who say that,\u201d replied the Professor. \u201cTrional frequently has a remarkable effect on the nervous tone. You mention trional, have you any idea what it is?\u201d \u201cWell . . . I\u2019ve heard people say that it is a drug to make one sleep.\u201d \u201cYou are not answering my question,\u201d replied the Professor, who, thrice weekly, at the Faculty, sat on the board of examiners. \u201cI don\u2019t ask you whether it makes you sleep or not, but what it is. Can you tell me what percentage it contains of amyl and ethyl?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer with embarrassment. \u201cI prefer a good glass of old brandy or even 345 Port.\u201d \u201cWhich are ten times as toxic,\u201d the Professor interrupted. \u201cAs for trional,\u201d M. de Cambremer ventured, \u201cmy wife goes in for all that sort of thing, you\u2019d better talk to her about it.\u201d \u201cShe probably knows just as much about it as yourself. In any case, if your wife takes trional to make her sleep, you can see that mine has no need of it. Come along, L\u00e9ontine, wake up, you\u2019re getting ankylosed, did you ever see me fall asleep after dinner? What will you be like when you\u2019re sixty, if you fall asleep now like an old woman? You\u2019ll go and get fat, you\u2019re arresting the circulation. She doesn\u2019t even hear what I\u2019m saying.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re bad for one\u2019s health, these little naps after dinner, ain\u2019t they, Doctor?\u201d said M. de Cambremer, seeking to rehabilitate himself with Cottard. \u201cAfter a heavy meal one ought to take exercise.\u201d \u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d replied the Doctor. \u201cWe have taken identical quantities of food from the stomach of a dog that has lain quiet and from the stomach of a dog that has been running about and it is in the former that digestion is more advanced.\u201d \u201cThen it is sleep that stops digestion.\u201d \u201cThat depends upon whether you mean oesophagic digestion, stomachic digestion, intestinal digestion; it is useless to give you explanations which you would not understand since you have never studied medicine. Now then, L\u00e9ontine, quick march, it is time we were going.\u201d This was not true, for the doctor was going merely to continue his game, but he hoped thus to cut short in a more drastic fashion the slumbers of the deaf mute to whom he had been addressing without a word of response the most learned exhortations. Whether a determination to remain awake survived in Mme. Cottard, even in the state of sleep, or because the armchair offered no support to her head, it was jerked mechanically from left to right, and up and down, in the empty air, like a lifeless object, and Mme. Cottard, with her nodding poll, appeared now to be listening to music, now to be in the last throes of death. Where her husband\u2019s increasingly vehement admonitions failed of their effect, her sense of her own stupidity proved successful. \u201cMy bath is nice and hot,\u201d she murmured, \u201cbut the feathers in the dictionary . . . \u201d she exclaimed as she sat bolt upright. \u201cOh! Good lord, what a fool I am. Whatever have I been saying, I was thinking about my hat, I\u2019m sure I said something silly, in another minute I should have been asleep, it\u2019s that wretched fire.\u201d Everybody began to laugh, for there was no fire in the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Note: In the French text of Sodome et Gomorrhe, Volume II ends at this point.]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are making fun of me,\u201d said Mme. Cottard, herself laughing, and raising her hand to her brow to wipe away, with the light touch of a hypnotist and the sureness of a woman putting her hair straight, the last traces of sleep, \u201cI must offer my humble apologies to dear Mme. Verdurin and ask her to tell me the truth.\u201d But her smile at once grew sorrowful, for the Professor who knew that his wife sought to please him and trembled lest she should fail, had shouted at her: \u201cLook at yourself in the glass, you are as red as if you had an eruption of acne, you look just like an old peasant.\u201d \u201cYou know, he is charming,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201che has such a delightfully sarcastic side to his character. And then, he snatched my husband from the jaws of death when the whole Faculty had given him up. He spent three nights by his bedside, without ever lying down. And so Cottard to me, you know,\u201d she went on, in a grave and almost menacing tone, raising her hand to the twin spheres, shrouded in white tresses, of her musical temples, and as though we had wished to assault the doctor, \u201cis sacred! He could ask me for anything in the world! As it is, I don\u2019t call him Doctor Cottard, I call him Doctor God! And even in saying that I am slandering him, for this God does everything in his power to remedy some of the disasters for which the other is responsible.\u201d \u201cPlay a trump,\u201d M. de Charlus said to Morel with a delighted air. \u201cA trump, here goes,\u201d said the violinist. \u201cYou ought to have declared your king first,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cyou\u2019re not paying attention to the game, but how well you play!\u201d \u201cI have the king,\u201d said Morel. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine man,\u201d replied the Professor. \u201cWhat\u2019s all that business up there with the sticks?\u201d asked Mme. Verdurin, drawing M. de Cambremer\u2019s attention to a superb escutcheon carved over the mantelpiece. \u201cAre they your arms?\u201d she added with an ironical disdain. \u201cNo, they are not ours,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer. \u201cWe bear, barry of five, embattled counter-embattled or and gules, as many trefoils countercharged. No, those are the arms of the Arrachepels, who were not of our stock, but from whom we inherited the house, and nobody of our line has ever made any changes here. The Arrachepels (formerly Pelvilains, we are told) bore or five piles couped in base gules. When they allied themselves with the F\u00e9terne family, their blazon changed, but remainedcantoned within twenty cross crosslets fitchee in base or, a dexter canton ermine.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one for her!\u201d muttered Mme. de Cambremer. \u201cMy great-grandmother was a d\u2019Arrachepel or de Rachepel, as you please, for both forms are found in the old charters,\u201d continued M. de Cambremer, blushing vividly, for only then did the idea for which his wife had given him credit occur to him, and he was afraid that Mme. Verdurin might have applied to herself a speech which had been made without any reference to her. \u201cThe history books say that, in the eleventh century, the first Arrachepel, Mace, named Pelvilain, shewed a special aptitude, in siege warfare, in tearing up piles. Whence the name Arrachepel by which he was ennobled, and the piles which you see persisting through the centuries in their arms. These are the piles which, to render fortifications more impregnable, used to be driven, plugged, if you will pardon the expression, into the ground in front of them, and fastened together laterally. They are what you quite rightly called sticks, though they had nothing to do with the floating sticks of our good Lafontaine. For they were supposed to render a stronghold unassailable. Of course, with our modern artillery, they make one smile. But you must bear in mind that I am speaking of the eleventh century.\u201d \u201cIt is all rather out of date,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cbut the little campanile has a character.\u201d \u201cYou have,\u201d said Cottard, \u201cthe luck of . . . turlututu,\u201d a word which he gladly repeated to avoid using Moli\u00e8re\u2019s. \u201cDo you know why the king of diamonds was turned out of the army?\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t mind being in his shoes,\u201d said Morel, who was tired of military service. \u201cOh! What a bad patriot,\u201d exclaimed M. de Charlus, who could not refrain from pinching the violinist\u2019s ear. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t know why the king of diamonds was turned out of the army,\u201d Cottard pursued, determined to make his joke, \u201cit\u2019s because he has only one eye.\u201d \u201cYou are up against it, Doctor,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, to shew Cottard that he knew who he was. \u201cThis young man is astonishing,\u201d M. de Charlus interrupted innocently. \u201cHe plays like a god.\u201d This observation did not find favour with the doctor, who replied: \u201cNever too late to mend. Who laughs last, laughs longest.\u201d \u201cQueen, ace,\u201d Morel, whom fortune was favouring, announced triumphantly. The doctor bowed his head as though powerless to deny this good fortune, and admitted, spellbound: \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cWe are so pleased to have met M. de Charlus,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer to Mme. Verdurin. \u201cHad you never met him before? He is quite nice, he is unusual, he is of a period\u201c (she would have found it difficult to say which), replied Mme. Verdurin with the satisfied smile of a connoisseur, a judge and a hostess. Mme. de Cambremer asked me if I was coming to F\u00e9terne with Saint-Loup. I could not suppress a cry of admiration when I saw the moon hanging like an orange lantern beneath the vault of oaks that led away from the house. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing, presently, when the moon has risen higher and the valley is lighted up, it will be a thousand times better.\u201d \u201cAre you staying any time in this neighbourhood, Madame?\u201d M. de Cambremer asked Mme. Cottard, a speech that might be interpreted as a vague intention to invite and dispensed him for the moment from making any more precise engagement. \u201cOh, certainly, Sir, I regard this annual exodus as most important for the children. Whatever you may say, they must have fresh air. The Faculty wanted to send me to Vichy; but it is too stuffy there, and I can look after my stomach when those big boys of mine have grown a little bigger. Besides, the Professor, with all the examinations he has to hold, has always got his shoulder to the wheel, and the hot weather tires him dreadfully. I feel that a man needs a thorough rest after he has been on the go all the year like that. Whatever happens we shall stay another month at least.\u201d \u201cAh! In that case we shall meet again.\u201d \u201cBesides, I shall be all the more obliged to stay here as my husband has to go on a visit to Savoy, and won\u2019t be finally settled here for another fortnight.\u201d \u201cI like the view of the valley even more than the sea view,\u201d Mme. Verdurin went on. \u201cYou are going to have a splendid night for your journey.\u201d \u201cWe ought really to find out whether the carriages are ready, if you are absolutely determined to go back to Balbec to-night,\u201d M. Verdurin said to me, \u201cfor I see no necessity for it myself. We could drive you over to-morrow morning. It is certain to be fine. The roads are excellent.\u201d I said that it was impossible. \u201cBut in any case it is not time yet,\u201d the Mistress protested. \u201cLeave them alone, they have heaps of time. A lot of good it will do them to arrive at the station with an hour to wait. They are far happier here. And you, my young Mozart,\u201d she said to Morel, not venturing to address M. de Charlus directly, \u201cwon\u2019t you stay the night? We have some nice rooms facing the sea.\u201d \u201cNo, he can\u2019t,\u201d M. de Gharlus replied on behalf of the absorbed card-player who had not heard. \u201cHe has a pass until midnight only. He must go back to bed like a good little boy, obedient, and well-behaved,\u201d he added in a complaisant, mannered, insistent voice, as though he derived some sadic pleasure from the use of this chaste comparison and also from letting his voice dwell, in passing, upon any reference to Morel, from touching him with (failing his fingers) words that seemed to explore his person\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the sermon that Brichot had addressed to me, M. de Cambremer had concluded that I was a Dreyfusard. As he himself was as anti-Dreyfusard as possible, out of courtesy to a foe, he began to sing me the praises of a Jewish colonel who had always been very decent to a cousin of the Chevregny and had secured for him the promotion he deserved. \u201cAnd my cousin\u2019s opinions were the exact opposite,\u201d said M. de Cambremer; he omitted to mention what those opinions were, but I felt that they were as antiquated and misshapen as his own face, opinions which a few families in certain small towns must long have entertained. \u201cWell, you know, I call that really fine!\u201d was M. de Cambremer\u2019s conclusion. It is true that he was hardly employing the word \u2018fine\u2019 in the aesthetic sense in which it would have suggested to his wife and mother different works, but works, anyhow, of art. M. de Cambremer often made use of this term, when for instance he was congratulating a delicate person who had put on a little flesh. \u201cWhat, you have gained half-a-stone in two months. I say, that\u2019s fine!\u201d Refreshments were set out on a table. Mme. Verdurin invited the gentlemen to go and choose whatever drinks they preferred. M. de Charlus went and drank his glass and at once returned to a seat by the card-table from which he did not stir. Mme. Verdurin asked him: \u201cHave you tasted my orangeade?\u201d Upon which M. de Charlus, with a gracious smile, in a crystalline tone which he rarely sounded and with endless motions of his lips and body, replied: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, it was strawberry-juice, I think, it was delicious.\u201d It is curious that a certain order of secret actions has the external effect of a manner of speaking or gesticulating which reveals them. If a gentleman believes or disbelieves in the Immaculate Conception, or in the innocence of Dreyfus, or in a plurality of worlds, and wishes to keep his opinion to himself, you will find nothing in his voice or in his movements that will let you read his thoughts. But on hearing M. de Charlus say in that shrill voice and with that smile and waving his arms: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, the strawberry-juice,\u201d one could say: \u201cThere, he likes the stronger sex,\u201d with the same certainty as enables a judge to sentence a criminal who has not confessed, a doctor a patient suffering from general paralysis who himself is perhaps unaware of his malady but has made some mistake in pronunciation from which one can deduce that he will be dead in three years. Perhaps the people who conclude from a man\u2019s way of saying: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, the strawberry-juice,\u201d a love of the kind called unnatural, have no need of any such scientific knowledge. But that is because there is a more direct relation between the revealing sign and the secret. Without saying it in so many words to oneself, one feels that it is a gentle, smiling lady who is answering and who appears mannered because she is pretending to be a man and one is not accustomed to seeing men adopt such mannerisms. And it is perhaps more pleasant to think that for long years a certain number of angelic women have been included by mistake in the masculine sex where, in exile, ineffectually beating their wings towards men in whom they inspire a physical repulsion, they know how to arrange a drawing-room, compose \u2018interiors.\u2019 M. de Charlus was not in the least perturbed that Mme. Verdurin should be standing, and remained installed in his armchair so as to be nearer to Morel. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it criminal,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin to the Baron, \u201cthat that creature who might be enchanting us with his violin should be sitting there at a card-table. When anyone can play the violin like that!\u201d \u201cHe plays cards well, he does everything well, he is so intelligent,\u201d said M. de Charlus, keeping his eye on the game, so as to be able to advise Morel. This was not his only reason, however, for not rising from his chair for Mme. Verdurin. With the singular amalgam that he had made of the social conceptions at once of a great nobleman and an amateur of art, instead of being polite in the same way that a man of his world would be, he would create a sort of tableau-vivant for himself after Saint-Simon; and at that moment was amusing himself by impersonating the Mar\u00e9chal d\u2019Uxelles, who interested him from other aspects also, and of whom it is said that he was so proud as to remain seated, with a pretence of laziness, before all the most distinguished persons at court. \u201cBy the way, Charlus,\u201d said Mme. Verdurip, who was beginning to grow familiar, \u201cyou don\u2019t know of any ruined old nobleman in your Faubourg who would come to me as porter?\u201d \u201cWhy, yes . . . why, yes,\u201d replied M. de Charlus with a genial smile, \u201cbut I don\u2019t advise it.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cI should be afraid for your sake, that your smart visitors would call at the lodge and go no farther.\u201d This was the first skirmish between them. Mme. Verdurin barely noticed it. There were to be others, alas, in Paris. M. de Charlus remained glued to his chair. He could not, moreover, restrain a faint smile, seeing how his favourite maxims as to aristocratic prestige and middle-class cowardice were confirmed by the so easily won submission of Mme. Verdurin. The Mistress appeared not at all surprised by the Baron\u2019s posture, and if she left him it was only because she had been perturbed by seeing me taken up by M. de Cambremer. But first of all, she wished to clear up the mystery of M. de Charlus\u2019s relations with Comtesse Mole. \u201cYou told me that you knew Mme. de Mol\u00ea. Does that mean, you go there?\u201d she asked, giving to the words \u2018go there\u2019 the sense of being received there, of having received authority from the lady to go and call upon her. M. de Charlus replied with an inflexion of disdain, an affectation of precision and in a sing-song tone: \u201cYes, sometimes.\u201d This \u2018sometimes\u2019 inspired doubts in Mme. Verdurin, who asked: \u201cHave you ever met the Duc de Guermantes there?\u201d \u201cAh! That I don\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cyou don\u2019t know the Duc de Guermantes?\u201d \u201cAnd how should I not know him?\u201d replied M. de Charlus, his lips curving in a smile. This smile was ironical; but as the Baron was afraid of letting a gold tooth be seen, he stopped it with a reverse movement of his lips, so that the resulting sinuosity was that of a good-natured smile. \u201cWhy do you say: \u2018How should I not know him?\u2019 \u201c \u201cBecause he is my brother,\u201d said M. de Charlus carelessly, leaving Mme. Verdurin plunged in stupefaction and in the uncertainty whether her guest was making fun of her, was a natural son, or a son by another marriage. The idea that the brother of the Duc de Guermantes might be called Baron de Charlus never entered her head. She bore down upon me. \u201cI heard M. de Cambremer invite you to dinner just now. It has nothing to do with me, you understand. But for your own sake, I do hope you won\u2019t go. For one thing, the place is infested with bores. Oh! If you like dining with provincial Counts and Marquises whom nobody knows, you will be supplied to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d \u201cI think I shall be obliged to go there once or twice. I am not altogether free, however, for I have a young cousin whom I cannot leave by herself\u201d (I felt that this fictitious kinship made it easier for me to take Albertine about). \u201cBut as for the Cambremers, as I have been introduced to them. . . . \u201d \u201cYou shall do just as you please. One thing I can tell you: it\u2019s extremely unhealthy; when you have caught pneumonia, or a nice little chronic rheumatism, you\u2019ll be a lot better off!\u201d \u201cBut isn\u2019t the place itself very pretty?\u201d \u201cMmmmyess. . . . If you like. For my part, I confess frankly that I would a hundred times rather have the view from here over this valley. To begin with, if they\u2019d paid us I wouldn\u2019t have taken the other house because the sea air is fatal to M. Verdurin. If your cousin suffers at all from nerves. . . . But you yourself have bad nerves, I think you have choking fits. Very well! You shall see. Go there once, you won\u2019t sleep for a week after it; but it\u2019s not my business.\u201d And without thinking of the inconsistency with what she had just been saying: \u201cIf it would amuse you to see the house, which is not bad, pretty is too strong a word, still it is amusing with its old moat, and the old drawbridge, as I shall have to sacrifice myself and dine there once, very well, come that day, I shall try to bring all my little circle, then it will be quite nice. The day after to-morrow we are going to Harambouville in the carriage. It\u2019s a magnificent drive, the cider is delicious. Come with us. You, Brichot, you shall come too. And you too, Ski. That will make a party which, as a matter of fact, my husband must have arranged already. I don\u2019t know whom all he has invited, Monsieur de Charlus, are you one of them?\u201d The Baron, who had not heard the whole speech, and did not know that she was talking of an excursion to Harambouville, gave a start. \u201cA strange question,\u201d he murmured in a mocking tone by which Mme. Verdurin felt hurt. \u201cAnyhow,\u201d she said to me, \u201cbefore you dine with the Cambremers, why not bring her here, your cousin? Does she like conversation, and clever people? Is she pleasant? Yes, very well then. Bring her with you. The Cambremers aren\u2019t the only people in the world. I can understand their being glad to invite her, they must find it difficult to get anyone. Here she will have plenty of fresh air, and lots of clever men. In any case, I am counting on you not to fail me next Wednesday. I heard you were having a tea-party at Rivebelle with your cousin, and M. de Charlus, and I forget who\u2019 else. You must arrange to bring the whole lot on here, it would be nice if you all came in a body. It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to get here, the roads are charming; if you like I can send down for you. I can\u2019t imagine what you find attractive in Rivebelle, it\u2019s infested with mosquitoes. You are thinking perhaps of the reputation of the rock-cakes. My cook makes them far better. I can let you have them, here, Norman rock-cakes, the real article, and shortbread; I need say no more. Ah! If you like the filth they give you at Rivebelle, that I won\u2019t give you, I don\u2019t poison my guests, Sir, and even if I wished to, my cook would refuse to make such abominations and would leave my service. Those rock-cakes you get down there, you can\u2019t tell what they are made of. I knew a poor girl who got peritonitis from them, which carried her off in three days. She was only seventeen. It was sad for her poor mother,\u201d added Mme. Verdurin with a melancholy air beneath the spheres of her temples charged with experience and suffering. \u201cHowever, go and have tea at Rivebelle, if you enjoy being fleeced and flinging money out of the window. But one thing I beg of you, it is a confidential mission I am charging you with, on the stroke of six, bring all your party here, don\u2019t allow them to go straggling away by themselves. You can bring whom you please. I wouldn\u2019t say that to everybody. But I am sure that your friends are nice, I can see at once that we understand one another. Apart from the little nucleus, there are some very pleasant people coming on Wednesday. You don\u2019t know little Madame de Longpont. She is charming, and so witty, not in the least a snob, you will find, you\u2019ll like her immensely. And she\u2019s going to bring a whole troop of friends too,\u201d Mme. Verdurin added to shew me that this was the right thing to do and encourage me by the other\u2019s example. \u201cWe shall see which has most influence and brings most people, Barbe de Longpont or you. And then I believe somebody\u2019s going to bring Bergotte,\u201d she added with a vague air, this meeting with a celebrity being rendered far from likely by a paragraph which had appeared in the papers that morning, to the effect that the great writer\u2019s health was causing grave anxiety. \u201cAnyhow, you will see that it will be one of my most successful Wednesdays, I don\u2019t want to have any boring women. You mustn\u2019t judge by this evening, it has been a complete failure. Don\u2019t try to be polite, you can\u2019t have been more bored than I was, I thought myself it was deadly. It won\u2019t always be like to-night, you know! I\u2019m not thinking of the Cambremers, who are impossible, but I have known society people who were supposed to be pleasant, well, compared with my little nucleus, they didn\u2019t exist. I heard you say that you thought Swann clever. I must say, to my mind, his cleverness was greatly exaggerated, but without speaking of the character of the man, which I have always found fundamentally antipathetic, sly, underhand, I have often had him to dinner on Wednesdays. Well, you can ask the others, even compared with Brichot, who is far from being anything wonderful, a good assistant master, whom I got into the Institute, Swann was simply nowhere. He was so dull!\u201d And, as I expressed a contrary opinion: \u201cIt\u2019s the truth. I don\u2019t want to say a word against him to you, since he was your friend, indeed he was very fond of you, he has spoken to me about you in the most charming way, but ask the others here if he ever said anything interesting, at our dinners. That, after all, is the supreme test. Well, I don\u2019t know why it was, but Swann, in my house, never seemed to come off, one got nothing out of him. And yet anything there ever was in him he picked up here.\u201d I assured her that he was highly intelligent. \u201cNo, you only think that, because you haven\u2019t known him as long as I have. One got to the end of him very soon. I was always bored to death by him.\u201d (Which may be interpreted: \u201cHe went to the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles and the Guermantes and knew that I didn\u2019t.\u201d) \u201cAnd I can put up with anything, except being bored. That, I cannot and will not stand!\u201d Her horror of boredom was now the reason upon which Mme. Verdurin relied to explain the composition of the little group. She did not yet entertain duchesses because she was incapable of enduring boredom, just as she was unable to go for a cruise, because of sea-sickness. I thought to myself that what Mme. Verdurin said was not entirely false, and, whereas the Guermantes would have declared Brichot to be the stupidest man they had ever met, I remained uncertain whether he were not in reality superior, if not to Swann himself, at least to the other people endowed with the wit of the Guermantes who would have had the good taste to avoid and the modesty to blush at his pedantic pleasantries; I asked myself the question as though a fresh light might be thrown on the nature of the intellect by the answer that I should make, and with the earnestness of a Christian influenced by Port-Royal when he considers the problem of Grace. \u201cYou will see,\u201d Mme. Verdurin continued, \u201cwhen one has society people together with people of real intelligence, people of our set, that\u2019s where one has to see them, the society man who is brilliant in the kingdom of the blind, is only one-eyed here. Besides, the others don\u2019t feel at home any longer. So much so that I\u2019m inclined to ask myself whether, instead of attempting mixtures that spoil everything, I shan\u2019t start special evenings confined to the bores so as to have the full benefit of my little nucleus. However: you are coming again with your cousin. That\u2019s settled. Good. At any rate you will both find something to eat here. F\u00e9terne is starvation corner. Oh, by the way, if you like rats, go there at once, you will get as many as you want. And they will keep you there as long as you are prepared to stay. Why, you\u2019ll die of hunger. I\u2019m sure, when I go there, I shall have my dinner before I start. The more the merrier, you must come here first and escort me. We shall have high tea, and supper when we get back. Do you like apple-tarts? Yes, very well then, our chef makes the best in the world. You see, I was quite right when I told you that you were meant to live here. So come and stay. You know, there is far more room in the house than people think. I don\u2019t speak of it, so as not to let myself in for bores. You might bring your cousin to stay. She would get a change of air from Balbec. With this air here, I maintain I can cure incurables. I have cured them, I may tell you, and not only this time. For I have stayed quite close to here before, a place I discovered and got for a mere song, a very different style of house from their Raspelicre. I can shew you it if we go for a drive together. But I admit that even here the air is invigorating. Still, I don\u2019t want to say too much about it, the whole of Paris would begin to take a fancy to my little corner. That has always been my luck. Anyhow, give your cousin my message. We shall put you in two nice rooms looking over the valley, you ought to see it in the morning, with the sun shining on the mist! By the way, who is this Robert de Saint-Loup of whom you were speaking?\u201d she said with a troubled air, for she had heard that I was to pay him a visit at Donci\u00e8res, and was afraid that he might make me fail her. \u201cWhy not bring him here instead, if he\u2019s not a bore. I have heard of him from Morel; I fancy he\u2019s one of his greatest friends,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin with entire want of truth, for Saint-Loup and Morel were not even aware of one another\u2019s existence. But having heard that Saint-Loup knew M. de Charlus, she supposed that it was through the violinist, and wished to appear to know all about them. \u201cHe\u2019s not taking up medicine, by any chance, or literature? You know, if you want any help about examinations, Cottard can do anything, and I make what use of him I please. As for the Academy later on, for I suppose he\u2019s not old enough yet, I have several notes in my pocket. Your friend would find himself on friendly soil here, and it might amuse him perhaps to see over the house. Life\u2019s not very exciting at Donci\u00e8res. But you shall do just what you please, then you can arrange what you think best,\u201d she concluded, without insisting, so as not to appear to be trying to know people of noble birth, and because she always maintained that the system by which she governed the faithful, to wit despotism, was named liberty. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter with you,\u201d she said, at the sight of M. Verdurin who, with gestures of impatience, was making for the wooden terrace that ran along the side of the drawing-room above the valley, like a man who is bursting with rage and must have fresh air. \u201cHas Saniette been annoying you again? But you know what an idiot he is, you have to resign yourself to him, don\u2019t work yourself up into such a state. I dislike this sort of thing,\u201d she said to me, \u201cbecause it is bad for him, it sends the blood to his head. But I must say that one would need the patience of an angel at times to put up with Saniette, and one must always remember that it is a charity to have him in the house. For my part I must admit that he\u2019s so gloriously silly, I can\u2019t help enjoying him. I dare say you heard what he said after dinner: \u2018I can\u2019t play whist, but I can the piano.\u2019 Isn\u2019t it superb? It is positively colossal, and incidentally quite untrue, for he knows nothing at all about either. But my husband, beneath his rough exterior, is very sensitive, very kind-hearted, and Saniette\u2019s self-centred way of always thinking about the effect he is going to make drives himcrazy. Come, dear, calm yourself, you know Cottard told you that it was bad for your liver. And it is I that will have to bear the brunt of it all,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cTo-morrow Saniette will come back all nerves and tears. Poor man, he is very ill indeed. Still, that is no reason why he should kill other people. Besides, even at times when he is in pain, when one would like to be sorry for him, his silliness hardens one\u2019s heart. He is really too stupid. You have only to tell him quite politely that these scenes make you both ill, and he is not to come again, since that\u2019s what he\u2019s most afraid of, it will have a soothing effect on his nerves,\u201d Mme. Verdurin whispered to her husband\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One could barely make out the sea from the windows on the right. But those on the other side shewed the valley, now shrouded in a snowy cloak of moonlight. Now and again one heard the voices of Morel and Cottard. \u201cYou have a trump?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAh! You\u2019re in luck, you are,\u201d said M. de Cambremer to Morel, in answer to his question, for he had seen that the doctor\u2019s hand was full of trumps. \u201cHere comes the lady of diamonds,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cThat\u2019s a trump, you know? My trick. But there isn\u2019t a Sorbonne any longer,\u201d said the doctor to M. de Cambremer; \u201cthere\u2019s only the University of Paris.\u201d M. de Cambremer confessed his inability to understand why the doctor made this remark to him. \u201cI thought you were talking about the Sorbonne,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cI heard you say: tu nous la sors bonne,\u201d he added, with a wink, to shew that this was meant for a pun. \u201cJust wait a moment,\u201d he said, pointing to his adversary, \u201cI have a Trafalgar in store for him.\u201d And the prospect must have been excellent for the doctor, for in his joy his shoulders began to shake rapturously with laughter, which in his family, in the \u2018breed\u2019 of the Cottards, was an almost zoological sign of satisfaction. In the previous generation the gesture of rubbing the hands together as though one were soaping them used to accompany this movement. Cottard himself had originally employed both forms simultaneously, but one fine day, nobody ever knew by whose intervention, wifely, professorial perhaps, the rubbing of the hands had disappeared. The doctor even at dominoes, when he got his adversary on the run, and made him take the double six, which was to him the keenest of pleasures, contented himself with shaking his shoulders. And when \u2014 which was as seldom as possible \u2014 he went down to his native village for a few days, and met his first cousin, who was still at the hand-rubbing stage, he would say to Mme. Cottard on his return: \u201cI thought poor Ren\u00e9 very common.\u201d \u201cHave you the little dee-ar?\u201d he said, turning to Morel. \u201cNo? Then I play this old David.\u201d \u201cThen you have five, you have won!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a great victory, Doctor,\u201d said the Marquis. \u201cA Pyrrhic victory,\u201d said Cottard, turning to face the Marquis and looking at him over his glasses to judge the effect of his remark. \u201cIf there is still time,\u201d he said to Morel, \u201cI give you your revenge. It is my deal. Ah! no, here come the carriages, it will have to be Friday, and I shall shew you a trick you don\u2019t see every day.\u201d M. and Mme. Verdurin accompanied us to the door. The Mistress was especially coaxing with Saniette so as to make certain of his returning next time. \u201cBut you don\u2019t look to me as if you were properly wrapped up, my boy,\u201d said M. Verdurin, whose age allowed him to address me in this paternal tone. \u201cOne would say the weather had changed.\u201d These words filled me with joy, as though the profoundly hidden life, the uprising of different combinations which they implied in nature, hinted at other changes, these occurring in my own life, and created fresh possibilities in it. Merely by opening the door upon the park, before leaving, one felt that a different \u2018weather\u2019 had, at that mo-merit, taken possession of the scene; cooling breezes, one of the joys of summer, were rising in the fir plantation (where long ago Mme. de Cambremer had dreamed of Chopin) and almost imperceptibly, in caressing coils, capricious eddies, were beginning their gentle nocturnes. I declined the rug which, on subsequent evenings, I was to accept when Albertine was with me, more to preserve the secrecy of my pleasure than to avoid the risk of cold. A vain search was made for the Norwegian philosopher. Had he been seized by a colic? Had he been afraid of missing the train? Had an aeroplane come to fetch him? Had he been carried aloft in an Assumption? In any case he had vanished without anyone\u2019s noticing his departure, like a god. \u201cYou are unwise,\u201d M. de Cambremer said to me, \u201cit\u2019s as cold as charity.\u201d \u201cWhy charity?\u201d the doctor inquired. \u201cBeware of choking,\u201d the Marquis went on. \u201cMy sister never goes out at night. However, she is in a pretty bad state at present. In any case you oughtn\u2019t to stand about bare-headed, put your tile on at once.\u201d \u201cThey are not frigorifie chokings,\u201d said Cottard sententiously. \u201cOh, indeed!\u201d M. de Cambremer bowed. \u201cOf course, if that\u2019s your opinion. . . . \u201d \u201cOpinions of the press!\u201d said the doctor, smiling round his glasses. M. de Cambremer laughed, but, feeling certain that he was in the right, insisted: \u201cAll the same,\u201d he said, \u201cwhenever my sister goes out after dark, she has an attack.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no use quibbling,\u201d replied the doctor, regardless of his want of manners. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t practise medicine by the seaside, unless I am called in for a consultation. I am here on holiday.\u201d He was perhaps even more on holiday than he would have liked. M. de Cambremer having said to him as they got into the carriage together: \u201cWe are fortunate in having quite close to us (not on your side of the Day, on the opposite side, but it is quite narrow at that point) another medical celebrity, Doctor du Boulbon,\u201d Cottard, who, as a rule, from \u2018deontology,\u2019 abstained from criticising his colleagues, could not help exclaiming, as he had exclaimed to me on the fatal day when we had visited the little casino: \u201cBut he is not a doctor. He practises \u2018a literary medicine, it is all fantastic therapeutics, charlatanism. All the same, we are on quite good terms. I should take the boat and go over and pay him a visit, if I weren\u2019t leaving.\u201d But, from the air which Cottard assumed in speaking of du Boulbon to M. de Cambremer, I felt that the boat which he would gladly have taken to call upon him would have greatly resembled that vessel which, in order to go and ruin the waters discovered by another literary doctor, Virgil (who took all their patients from them as well), the doctors of Salerno had chartered, but which sank with them on the voyage. \u201cGood-bye, my dear Saniette, don\u2019t forget to come to-morrow, you know how my husband enjoys seeing you. He enjoys your wit, your intellect; yes indeed, you know quite well, he takes sudden moods, but he can\u2019t live without seeing you. It\u2019s always the first thing he asks me: \u2018Is Saniette coming? I do so enjoy seeing him.\u2019\u201d \u201cI never said anything of the sort,\u201d said M. Verdurin to Saniette with a feigned frankness which seemed perfectly to reconcile what the Mistress had just said with the manner in which he treated Saniette. Then looking at his watch, doubtless so as not to prolong the leave-taking in the damp night air, he warned the coachmen not to lose any time, but to be careful when going down the hill, and assured us that we should be in plenty of time for our train. This was to set down the faithful, one at one station, another at another, ending with myself, for no one else was going as far as Balbec, and beginning with the Cambremers. They, so as not to bring their horses all the way up to la Raspeli\u00e8re at night, took the train with us at Douville-F\u00e9terne. The station nearest to them was indeed not this, which, being already at some distance from the village, was farther still from the mansion, but la Sogne. On arriving at the station of Douville-F\u00e9terne, M. de Cambremer made a point of giving a \u2018piece,\u2019 as Fran\u00e7oise used to say, to the Verdurins\u2019 coachman (the nice, sensitive coachman, with melancholy thoughts), for M. de Cambremer was generous, and in that respect took, rather, \u2018after his mamma.\u2019 But, possibly because his \u2018papa\u2019s\u2019 strain intervened at this point, he felt a scruple, or else that there might be a mistake \u2014 either on his part, if, for instance, in the dark, he were to give a you instead of a franc, or on the recipient\u2019s who might not perceive the importance of the present that was being given him. And so he drew attention to it: \u201cIt is a franc I\u2019m giving you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said to the coachman, turning the coin until it gleamed in the lamplight, and so that the faithful might report his action to Mme. Verdurin. \u201cIsn\u2019t it? Twenty sous is right, as it\u2019s only a short drive.\u201d He and Mme. de Cambremer left us at la Sogne. \u201cI shall tell my sister,\u201d he repeated to me, \u201cthat you have choking fits, I am sure she will be interested.\u201d I understood that he meant: \u2018will be pleased.\u2019 As for his wife, she employed, in saying good-bye to me, two abbreviations which, even in writing, used to shock me at that time in a letter, although one has grown accustomed to them since, but which, when spoken, seem to me to-day even to contain in their deliberate carelessness, in their acquired familiarity, something insufferably pedantic: \u201cPleased to have met you,\u201d she said to me; \u201cgreetings to Saint-Loup, if you see him.\u201d In making this speech, Mme. de Cambremer pronounced the name \u2018Saint-Loupe.\u2019 I have never discovered who had pronounced it thus in her hearing, or what had led her to suppose that it ought to be so pronounced. However it may be, for some weeks afterwards, she continued to say \u2018Saint-Loupe\u2019 and a man who had a great admiration for her and echoed her in every way did the same. If other people said \u2018Saint-Lou,\u2019 they would insist, would say emphatically \u2018Saint-Loupe,\u2019 whether to teach the others an indirect lesson or to be different from them. But, no doubt, women of greater brilliance than Mme. de Cambremer told her, or gave her indirectly to understand that this was not the correct pronunciation, and that what she regarded as a sign of originality was a mistake which would make people think her little conversant with the usages of society, for shortly afterwards Mme. de Cambremer was again saying \u2018Saint-Lou,\u2019 and her admirer similarly ceased to hold out, whether because she had lectured him, or because he had noticed that she no longer sounded the final consonant, and had said to himself that if a woman of such distinction, energy and ambition had yielded, it must have been on good grounds. The worst of her admirers was her husband. Mme. de Cambremer loved to tease other people in a way that was often highly impertinent. As soon as she began to attack me, or anyone else, in this fashion, M. de Cambremer would start watching her victim, laughing the while. As the Marquis had a squint \u2014 a blemish which gives an effect of wit to the mirth even of imbeciles \u2014 the effect of this laughter was to bring a segment of pupil into the otherwise complete whiteness of his eye. So a sudden rift brings a patch of blue into an otherwise clouded sky. His monocle moreover protected, like the glass over a valuable picture, this delicate operation. As for the actual intention of his laughter, it was hard to say whether it was friendly: \u201cAh! You rascal! You\u2019re in an enviable position, aren\u2019t you. You have won the favour of a lady who has a pretty wit!\u201d Or coarse: \u201cWell, Sir, I hope you\u2019ll learn your lesson, you\u2019ve got to eat a slice of humble pie.\u201d Or obliging: \u201cI\u2019m here, you know, I take it with a laugh because it\u2019s all pure fun, but I shan\u2019t let you be ill-treated.\u201d Or cruelly accessory: \u201cI don\u2019t need to add my little pinch of salt, but you can see, I\u2019m revelling in all the insults she is showering on you. I\u2019m wriggling like a hunchback, therefore I approve, I, the husband. And so, if you should take it into your head to answer back, you would have me to deal with, my young Sir. I should first of all give you a pair of resounding smacks, well aimed, then we should go and cross swords in the forest of Chantepie.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whatever the correct interpretation of the husband\u2019s merriment, the wife\u2019s whimsies soon came to an end. Whereupon M. de Cambremer ceased to laugh, the temporary pupil vanished and as one had forgotten for a minute or two to expect an entirely white eyeball, it gave this ruddy Norman an air at once anaemic and ecstatic, as though the Marquis had just undergone an operation, or were imploring heaven, through his monocle, for the palms of martyrdomEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

That's nice to be given advice when I paint it\nHave twice much the fame, and\nI can't even comprehend that much in the future\nHatin' the teacher, but you loving the tutor\nEnter the game, I'm a fuckin' intruder\nStealin' these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter\nProcrastinatin' 'cause my fucking computer\nNo willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser\n\n[Verse 4]\nSittin' alone at 3 AM\nChillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend\nMan, this shit is too wild, I \"must behave, Ben\"\nThat's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when\nI'm on the top of this drop and they're rocking the world with confidence\nAccomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?\n-Obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me\nLuckily, I've been trained to test the system, don't you fuck with me\nI hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it\nI hope that one day, you'll see we made it\nNo, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain, I just alleviate it\nI'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest\nThat is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'\nI'm givin' dignity, cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'\nI'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside\nGuessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind\n[Hook 1]\nAnd I'm in time\n-Workin' all my life, get that in line\nI'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out\nNobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline\nI'm on the incline, I'm on the incline\nStay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine\nI'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline\nNobody can really understand how my shit climb\n\n[Verse 5]\nHave I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet\nI'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead\nI stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous\nWho is this ten-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?\nWhy the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do\nI don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, \"Bye\", to you\nHey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do\nYou have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue\nYou gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset\nSet headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead\nI guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed\nImpressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said\nBut I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song\nDo right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron\nYou try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes\nSome straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline\n\n[Interlude 1]\nWater break\nI got a lot to say\nIt's been eleven minutes so far\nActually, it hasn't, it's been shorter\n\n[Verse 6]\nHow can\nI have a believable meaning\nWhen all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury\nNobody seen it or  greet it?\nBut what if it's different? I mean, it's all seeming to be\nAnd it's in inconceivable dreaming\nI know it's so unbelievable, being\nStuck in this rare unachievable feeling\nThey givin' me something, I ended up leaving\nThey givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'\nNo positive side, ended up seeing\nWhat life could be like from a  different lead in\nThank God for a cover zone\nSo I know when and where to cross it\nAll over the place\nI'm surprised I haven't lost it\n\n[Hook 2]\nYeah, ayy, and I'm feeling like I'm at the top, uh\nLivin' to the max now\nYeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud\nI'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background\nAnd the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down\nGo till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out\nAfter, I'll do the math now, it's garbage, take the trash out\nBut I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout\n\n[Verse 7]\nOkay, it's time to go fast\nSo sit back and relax, and just maybe you'll get it\nAbout time, but maybe you're mad I said it\nYou gon' pay attention, cash or credit?\nI have to let it go back a second\nI have some lyrics in the past that I have to edit\nNow we're back in the middle of the track and fed it\nMix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it\nWe moved on, walked past the exit\nWant you to come back and pass a message\n-Never pack bags and trash, you left it\nKinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it\nMoney, never am glad I spent it\nIf I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it\nIf you ever feel bad or sad, accept it\nThink back to the track and the rap that Ben did\nYeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it\nIf this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus\nI'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this\nVoice is more powerful than a million instruments\nSuddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else\nPeople want me to grow because of you\nBut I'm never going to level my endeavors to be better\nThan the people that never had trust in me\nYeah, uh\n\n[Hook 3]\nAnd I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah\nLivin' to the max now, uh\nYeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud\nI'm stepping up, I never back down, more focused on background\nAnd the music and how my rap sounds\n\n[Verse 8]\nSpeak up, and they're messing with the track now\nPeople are tellin' me that I'm fallin' short\nLooking back at you when you're missing all the cash now\nAnd I'm mad at the fact that\nI'm not in my right mind\nMeant to be a half-decent rapper\nBut I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time\nLookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find\nLookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime\nI find so much life\nI wonder why I can't just find mine\nGot so many confusing questions\nSo much knowledge, I can't use the lessons\nI'm emerging out with a new profession\nI'ma do the best with my new perfection\nAnd I'm doin' it\nI'm moving onto this future shit\nThese hooligans are complete fools in that\nThey just don't understand that I am through with it\nImprovin' it, I'm improvin' it\nI got my brain, and I'm usin' it\nAnd I'ma make it out alive when I'm playin' and takin'\nAnd makin' this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits\nYou're clueless\nNinety percent of y'all ignorant\nKeeping your minds oh-so limited\nGet off your high horse, because it is time to figure it out\nSeeming so close, I can picture it now\nSuccess in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now\nEnvisioning deeper ambitions, and now\nI'ma get to it, that is what living's about\n\n[Interlude 2]\nUh, God!\nUh\nMy voice is gone already, shit\nAlright, ayy, ayy, ayy\n\n[Verse 9]\nThink I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches\nAdolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us\nMakin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die\nMakin' you hang your head low, but say, \"Reach for the skies\"\nLife is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies\nI'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes\nI feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry\nWith all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try\nYeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply\nTryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry\nFuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, \"Why?\"\nSo I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh\nLike, oh well, I can say that I tried\nHopped into life and then I stayed for the ride\nSo many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside\nAnd I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn\nThis reminds me of days when I drive in L.A.\u200b\nI'm screamin', \"Hi\" to the sky up with a smile on my face\nNow I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace\nAll of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place\nSwept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace\nAnd now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet\nI used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic\nRecently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it\nSee my friends from kindergarten go to rehab\nThat's the type of shit that makes you think back\nTo simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds\nBefore reality could ground us, we would live in the skies\nAnd as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)\nMan, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist\nI felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist\nAnd now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit\nYou only look at what you got once you see that it's lost\nAnd life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce\nDon't understand rappers braggin', \"I got that paper on me\"\nMan, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me\nSo what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?\nTo me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money\nRain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study\nAnd write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn\nLike Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize\nThese Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's\nThis is a natural high\nI see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies\nI wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried\nThey say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie\nThey think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid\nAs DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive\nThrew out half of my album, it wasn't good enough\nShit, I mean it still isn't good enough\nI'm like a active volcano, I know I could erupt\nBut I guess I am not full enough, damn\nI swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel\nMan, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal\nMan, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real\nThirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel\nYeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement\nYeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent\nEvery day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest\nAnd if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted\nMost of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me\nSo when I die, I know I left us with something to leave\nSo when I wake up in the morning with something to see\nYeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be\n\n[Verse 10]\nBenny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said\nIf you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous-\nMany want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant\nGot iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence\nYeah, I know I'm way too cocky\nBut I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out\nSo when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better\nThat's benefit of the doubt\nI've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom\nIt's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often\nAnd I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around\nAlways stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-\nYeah, this is freedom of speech\nTryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace\nSacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree\nOpportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-\nNah, I'm just tryna find some clarity\nApparently, it all has to do with popularity\nThere will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to\nWhat is carefully being prepared to me\nSometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity\nI'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful in the very least\n\n[Verse 11]\nGiving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see\nEveryone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy\n'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case\nShot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass\nOff of the place, brought in a way, predict what I will probably say\nAnd at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so obviously, let the audience say\nSo let me explain this to those who came in, looking at the stages\nSeeing a white kid thinking he's famous, when they don't understand\nThat I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest\nEntertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in\n\n[Verse 12]\n-Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize\nStart an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try\nThat's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'\nWith the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon\nBut I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'\nLimited ability with little humility\nBut whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me\nI'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history\nTryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me\nTryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg\nYou beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me\nShowin' up on your device, control/option/delete\nConsider myself elite, measure myself in retweets\nI be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me\nInstead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout\nI'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house\nTryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch\nI'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out\nInto reality, in normality actually happily\nFound myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?\n'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing\nNothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing\nNot complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it\nLove sleepin' and just usin' the internet\nBut my time is limited, and I better figure this\nBefore I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips\nAnd let me just tell you what I have came to do\nTryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to\nTryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo\nAnd say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through\nAnd if a major record label is looking at me\nI'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats\nI can rap fast, and rap slow\nI may make mistakes but everyone, has, so\nI'm like MJ back when he had the afro\nAlso, I'm not black, so... maybe not\nBut before everyone gets angry, stop\nI'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block\nAll the people who keep on going crazy off\n'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got\nA lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker\nWith some dominant teachers\nI deserve to be a starter, but constantly on the bleachers\nI'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager\nThey be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it\nTo know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid\nSo when you're nearin' this, please let me know\nWhen I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go\nHear the metronome combined in the compilation\nTo unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation\nBut that is just a dream, and probably a combination\nOf a big ego and false encouragement on the way in\nBut when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game\nI was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name\nBut when you think about it, it is all insane\nWhat can be created from chemicals in this brain\nBut when you look at me, you lackin' respect\nWhen I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest\nHas in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step\nUntil I'm on the same stage, and you have it again\nBut, but when you think about the hall-of-fame\nYou think about how people used to sit and call you names\nAnd you check and wonder if it will be all the same\nStep back into reality, it all remains, damn\n\n[Interlude 3]\nAlright, I just spilled water on my computer right now\nOn my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit\nHold on, uh\nGoddamn it\n\n[Verse 13]\nMy lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean\nThis is off the top, I don't need to use no machines\nHold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever\nBut I am very clever, okay, okay\nI'm gonna take a drink, if you're watchin' this, take a drink too\nThese are some shit' that you can drink to\nBut drink water unless you're of age\nYou know what I'm sayin'? Ayy\n\n[Interlude 4]\nOkay, okay\nUh\nUh\nAyy\n\n[Verse 14]\nI feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous\n-Most of humanity's made of idiots\nI barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?\nYou think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?\nPlease... what I do is barely poetry\nThere's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me\nBut still consider me confident\nStill consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness\nBut honestly, all of this is haunting me, probably\nIt is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling\nInto awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'\nIt's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening\nIt's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake\nI close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away\nYeah, we're just tryna find that great escape\nTo get away from how we're living life day-to-day\nSome people find it in a drink or in a cup\nOr in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love\nBut all I know is that it's tough\nAnd all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much\n\n[Verse 15]\nI'm young and ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?\nThese kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players\nThat shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low\nGot amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be lyin', but I came to show\nWhat I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype\nAnd I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life\n-Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights\nAhead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night\n-Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass\n-Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast\nRemember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it\nAnd say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected\nTake a deep breath, 'cause I need that\nMost of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast\nMy bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors\nYou want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards\nSay that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this\nI'm singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit\nTryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day\n'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?\nI'm making the most of a crazier flow, so many ways it could go\nI'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home, I'm willing to make it my own\nI'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it, even if staying up late is the needed bit\nReason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it, leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch\nMeaning, these people ain't feelin' rich, reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it\nPleasin' these liars, they've peaked, and so now they're recedin' agreein' to be a live without leading it\nFlow's so dope, I think it's time that we take a break\nWe all make mistakes and play some hate, I got 808s here to save the day\n'Cause I am on top of it, lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it\nYou know my flow is so dominant, positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments\nAll of these offers is boring as fuck, though I am not a part of 'em\nStart a new part to the charts and I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it\nBreaking it up, like cartilage, flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it\nI know that you hate to admit it, but really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'\nUnder the radar, you don't know what's comin', I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'\nI found to be part of a little of something called love, and I guess that's the art of it\nI try to go slow, but it don't work\n-Gettin' better, and that don't hurt, and you think I'm dead, and you're sure\nYou're salty and not kosher, slave to the corporates and the owners\nThis is live and love, call it Shrek, like the ogre\nHah, bitch, I have had enough, and I am sure I ain't mad enough\nForgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success, and I look at the numbers, I add 'em up\nMy chart is like a parabola, thank you a lot for havin' us\nAnd so, every day, I take one step up, man, I am takin' the ladder up\n-Hundred K- get the plaque, lookin' forward, not heading back\nRemember what I had said is that we ain't givin' up, remember that\nHit me up when you're done whining, I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming\nListen up, 'cause I'm combining all my skills into one finding\nWe run, grinding, you know we do, we got the shit that we're goin' through\nThese lyrics go over you, you  don't listen, so you don't know it's true\n'Cause we in, and we've done it, thousands, now we a hundred\nShoutout to Didac and Momo and the others\nShit, I consider them brothers, shit, I consider you all are my family\nShoutout to those who will stand with me, even when all of the others abandon me\nYeah, drama, we move past that, now I look at you with the last laugh\nBetter trackback, now I rap fast, so many skills in my backpack\nStarted off so terribly, now all of these people compare to me\nIn the past, I never anticipated what there would be\nAnd see ya, so long now, off to the end of the song now\nSee ya next at five-hundred and a million, it's on now\n\n[Interlude 5]\nIt's on now\nOh shit, I'm almost out of water\nThis is a hard- this a- real challenge\nThis like, physically difficult, ayy\n\n[Hook 4]\nWhen I walk up in the scene, I hear a orchestra\nNow everybody telling me I don't perform enough\nMy math teacher told me that I'd never be shit\nAnd now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula\nI got the formula, I got the formula\nYou got the sauce, but goddamn, I got the formula, ayy\nPeople always asking Ben, \"Why you record so much?\"\nI got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up\n\n[Verse 16]\nFormula, like I'm Mr. Krabs\nI change and transform it up, you stuck in the past\nYeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab\nUh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag\nAnd now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'\nPeople love to criticize me for the life I've had\nThey make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'\nI make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, ayy\nUh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie\nAnd I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami\nWanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'\nTryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies\nAyy, still saying, \"Who would'a thought?\", like, who would'a guessed it?\nHaven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing\nIf you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:\nWant the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook\n\n[Verse 17]\nAyy, they doubt a fucker with a dream\nLooking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah\nLooking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens\nSerpent's told you, \"No,\" and it's like nothing's as it seems\nGod damn, I guess I really thought he was the man\nI guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham\nAll that cash he stocked was from a scam\nAll the views he got was from some spam\nI've been living like, \"Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?\nWhy ain't he just sticking to the plan?\nHow has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?\"\nI don't get it, I don't really understand\nI've been living like, \"Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram\nI'll do better if I study my exams, do I really wanna stand\nNext to all these average fucking sad duds?\"\nSo I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one\n\n[Hook 5]\nYeah\nHate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one\nAyy\nJust because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup\nUh, uh, uh\nFeel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones\nAnd so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he\n\n[Verse 18]\n'Cause he been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine\nI've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap\nThat shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now\nI'm making a- minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I'm needin' to figure this out\nHow did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday\nAnd I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away\nBut I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun\nSo I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one\n\n[Verse 19]\nBy now, if you're still watching this shit\nYou are a boss and you deserve some applause for this shit\nBut we ain't over, we ain't done, though\nAm I takin' a break? Are you dumb, bro?\nWell, we nearin' 10K, but I still need 30K\nWhile all you sit around, I would rather work than play\nLyrics go through your dome, through your vertebrae\nHit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates\n\n[Interlude 6]\nThat was actually a pretty good bar\nI just wrote that like, right- a second ago, before I recorded this\nAyy, ayy\nYou know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh\n\n[Hook 6]\nSometimes, I don't know what to think\nSometimes, I don't know what'll\nMake it okay, make it okay\nI'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, ayy\n\n[Verse 20]\nUh, I wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering\nAll these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen\nAll accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence\nOften is the result of falling under consciousness\nYou'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives\nYou're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie\nAnd I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty\nFearing that, one day ,you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me\nNo, will I tell you? No, never- I think I'm so clever\nBut in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better\nBut I don't ever\nWant to go to show, just one mo' letter\nI'm a go-getter, I go get A's and get grades\nAnd get A's, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid\nUh... my life is so unusual\nTo most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable\nCan't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral\nI'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero\nUh, but you know that I'm capable\nYou know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available\nFeeling so unique and I think it's not explainable\nNo one hears my lyrics, and says, \"OMG, relatable!\"\nNo, that's not what I'm here to give\nBeen waiting years for this, you're about to experience\nSomething that I've spent time, money and thought on\nLearned about all the times money had thought wrong\nKinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long\nI ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot\n-Out on the inside, see me on the outside\nAlways think I'm positive, and never see the downsides\nIt's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it\nGet your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it\n\n[Interlude 7]\nOkay\nOkay, okay, we're like thirty minutes in\nThirty minutes, but we got thirty-thousand, bro\nFuck\n\n[Verse 21]\nYeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware\nI'm like the 'e' that equals all other emcees squared\nI'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs\nBut y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared\nI got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of it\nShoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip\nMan, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders\nIt's not about who goes faster, but it's 'bout the man who'll hold his grip\nDamn, I got a crazy ass work ethic\nBlocked out south east and west, leave in one direction\nI finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it\nFuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection\nWe all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons\nLike a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'\nWanted to fuck a nun, started like really badly\nAnd I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar\nCan't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'\nYeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person\nI base my motivation on my favorite angels words a-\n-bout how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, that thing's for certain\n\n[Verse 22]\nYou keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high\nWanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy\nCan't deny I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize\nHow it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize\nAnd analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed\nAnd take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise\nAmerica is very nice, but I'd like to see the world\nBut I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl\n\n[Verse 23]\nIn a Mercedes Benz with his lady friends\nCrazy Ben is just chillin' with them women, you know they be tens\nThey be tens or more, they be tens or more\nI like to talk to all these people 'cause they marvel at my metaphors\nIt's free speech, I can say what I want\nBut these listenin' are tryna make me pay for my talk\nThey don't like what I'm doin', they don't appreciate the banter\nI get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh\nMotherfucker, I'ma live for the right time\nFuck that, I'ma live for the moment\nSitting here in the middle of the night time\nMy mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowin'\nDamn, I've been livin' in a headache\nBitches never listenin', they saying that they ready\nBut I can never believe them\nGot these goals and they can never achieve 'em\nHow can your dreams come true if you ain't willin' to dream 'em?\nDamn, that's a lot of shit to think about\nSuddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering\nWhat I'm doin', next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out\nMade some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh\nGot these dreams that I'm livin' out\nIn my mind's eye, givin' out lots of songs with responses\nThat I never pictured, wow, damn, damn\nThis beat's way too holy to rap over\nMental block, my mind's capacities, that's lower\nYour raps slower, they lack closure, they lack substance\nLike a printer without toner, y'all fillin' pages that have nothin'\nOoh, but I have got somethin' to tell you\nI ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you\nSpeakin' from late nights, I'm thinkin' of Drake's life\nWatching these interviews, thinkin' one day I might\nBe on that stage right beside all these players\nShit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers\nI'll prove it in music I use to influence\nI do this way harder than people assumin'\nResumin' my writin', viewin' this lightin'\nThat puts me to be in the view of the hidin'\nI do what they're likin', but that makes 'em hate me\nNo matter what I do, they just mistake the\nReason I'm flowin', the reason I start up\nNot just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks\nAnd- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place\nMost to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste\nI'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh\nI just need a home run, I already loaded bases\nI have got so many cases\nBeen visiting, living in so many places\nExperiences that I made me to Emmy\nBen, B-E-N, please, I hope you let me\nBe me, I ain't greedy or needy\nBelieve me, I just want to be on your TV\nGet on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase\nDamn, yeah, I've been looking at their space\nAnd, one day, I'll be there\nI know what I'm doin', I'm already prepared\n\n[Verse 24]\nI've been waiting like thirty-thousand years\nTryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear\nI'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career\nI'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here\nNow I earned it, and I'm here to stay\nI'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play\nNot even seventeen, eighteen, I'm so near to fame\nNot really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day\nI don't know- I look at the future nostalgically\nI'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me\nUndoubtably know how to be what I am about to be\nTo say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me\n\n[Verse 25]\nRecently, I have been feeling alienated\nMy songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em\nBut, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different\nHate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it\n\n[Verse 26]\nPeople say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen\nAll will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene\nY'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty\nPromise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?\nTrapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages\nWhen I would rap on the stages, and now, I laugh at those days, and\nI'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song\nMove along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns\nWho could bomb this whole place up with one great lung?\nOne great tongue, I am that one great one\nOn vacation, I vacate to a location\nFar away from where people just may run\nA light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun\nOh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young\nI can murder this beat with no gun, go run\nI've too many problems to handle, here, hold one\nI just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks\nAnd now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk\nWas a great song, catchy at first, but that radio station\nPlaying it, making it just get to the worst\nMy head's gonna burst if I hear it again, and I'm sure\nI'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth\nAnd now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it\nNow the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah\n\n[Verse 27]\nGood rappers never get to see the light of day\nBut when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away\nI'll obey... nah, whatever, man, what is this?\nI'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business\nNobody

I said, it's scary for a king, even\nThey call me odd, but I bring even\nI bring reason to believe, and you're eatin' it up for free, and\nThe meaning is rarely seen and no line can be drawn between 'em, I don't show seasons\nYeah, I am me no matter what, and that can grow pleasin'\nI'm barely close to anybody, I don't know people\nMan, I don't know people who so equal\nI don't know nobody who doesn't own evil\nMan, that is just a truth and a lie\nA truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky\nOr a suit and a tie, yeah, I'm new to this life, I'm new to my mind\nNew to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise\nAnd uh, I'm- lookin' at all of this shit\nOh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this\nYou get discouraged for one minute\nAnd the next one, you be callin' it quits\nAnd I'll probably get rich If I focus enough\nYou close-minded, let's open it up\nAnd all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'\nBut they do not know what is up\nUh, I just wish\nThat they'd go away\nAnd I won't obey\nNo, I will never ever show the way\nAnd I will try to mask it up\nWith other jokes on fucking jokes\nAlways playin' G'\nBut now I'm movin' onto other notes\n\n[Interlude 16]\nMy voice is fucking hurting\nIt's hurting a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training\nSo I don't know how to- just do this for a long period of time\nWithout causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?\nMan, I just live it up\nI'm gonna go a little bit quieter now\nUh-huh\nYeah\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAll of these people keep on changin'\nAll of these times and different phases\nAll of these lights on all these stages\nAll of these sights is so amazing\nYeah, I've seen at least a million faces\nA million times, a million places\nBut when it's all said and done\nI look and I wonder why, uh\n\n[Verse 43]\nEveryone knows that it's so amazing\nAll the support is my motivation\nCompared to the big people at the Capital\nMy name is spelt in lower cases\nPeople loved me before I made it\nPeople liked it before they watched it\nI'm wantin' way too much more than I have\nAnd I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it\nMan on a mission, and I g- vision\nOf talking a lot of wisdom, man, I gotta listen\nGotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow\nI'll be the teacher when they need the feature\nGot flow, and it's so damn crazy\nPeople consider me so amazing\nI'm holding control and then folding them verses\nIt hurts because I am on loaded bases\nAdvanced shit, I know the basics\nAlready know them, they're overrated\nMeanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hopin'\n'Cause now I am open for game, and\nI'm charged up\nI ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior\nSo many people they know the players\nDon't know the game and don't know the makers\nDon't know the fakers, but who cares?\nI'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater\nI'm here to go move and just go on the layers\nAnd bitch, I am going so later\nI got time\nMy own lyrics, I got mine\nAnd I'm on time for the wrong lines\nAnd I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go\n\n[Hook 14]\nI've been all on my own\nAll on my own, people keep calling my phone\nWanting to know when I'll be the star of the show\nBut I'm all my own, yeah\nAnd I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it\n'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-\nThe ghost of me is haunting the throne\nSo I'll make it there all on my own\n\n[Verse 44]\nMy intermission is mixing with intermissions\nAnd following intuition conflicting with my decision\nAnd it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval\nAnd it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful\nAnd it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you\nAppearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement\nTo a new type of thing that you can gain from\nTo push away the past and the places that you came from\nDay one for me was like six months ago-\n\n[Interlude 17]\nOh, holy shit!\nI actually reached the end of the beat\nBut I still have, like\nTen-thousand more words\nHold on, I gotta pause this\nHold on, three, it's still one take\n\n[Verse 45]\n-Past and the places that you came from\nDay one for me was like six months ago\nLook at where we been, but imagine where one can go\nIt's not fun to know that we just livin' to die\nIt's not fun to know that we just livin' to die\nWe now know how much money you can give for a lie\nGive for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?\nWhat's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?\nSo, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen\nAlways been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man\n\n[Hook 15]\nYeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch\nUh, I ain't the star of the show, bitch\n\n[Verse 46]\nI know like four people who truly respect the grind\nAnd it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme\nAnd then if time is money then free time ain't really free\nAnd all my fan' pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me\n-Stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree\nI want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me\nIn the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me\nBigger than you, bigger than anybody in history\nThe challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize\nTo satisfy your lavish life and have a crazy magic time\nAnd luckily, I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time\nTo learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind\nI'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got\nSeveral different things to potentially make my job\nI want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs\nAnd also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks\nA million- shit, all we ever want is more, really\nAnd once I get three million, I want four milli'\nIt's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle\nWe can never be happy, but that is so vital\n\n[Interlude 18]\nUh\nThose are actually some good lyrics, uh\n\n[Verse 47]\nRebirth, feet hit the earth, my knees hurt\nThey're weaker than previously, her\nBreathing seems to be burnt like free CDs were\nBefore we could be searched, I'm like \"Please, just please work\"\nLike a lenient slave owner\u2014 that's edgy, like gravestones, oh, you get me\nI saved dough for a Bentley, t'ere more than a Chevy\nI play- I play-\n-Who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy?\nUh, I've been tryin' to prove to all of the people I knew who didn't like what I do\nDisgusted like, \"Ew\", yeah, this shit goes outta you, plans have now all become true\nI'm seeing them through, man, that's the reason I do, all of the things that I do\nIt's not for a crew, not for a god or a demon, I've really been needing a clue\nFillin' these shoes, reading these pieces and news, damn, this shit really is screwed\nIt gives me the blues whenever I'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh\nBut if ignorance is really bliss, then why this ignorance be killin' kids?\nAnd why this ignorance that's clearly vicious is not given shit and ends up innocent?\nThat shit really is ridiculous, it's magnificently fucked up\nBut nobody wants to tough it up, I haven't seen it goin' down, it's comin' up\nL\u2014\n\n[Verse 48]\n\u2014cay to the Vatican, havin' them\nGood times and bad times with New Romans, do that again, well, that was when\nI was so young, too young to really know fun\nBut so what? I guess that's what happens when you grow up\nDry your eyes and wipe your nose up\nJust keep drinking till you throw up, no, we won't judge\nBut we all just want to be loved and somehow get validated by those we hate\nSuch a twisted system that we've been given to operate\nI've been really thinkin' and figurin' out who's not a fake\nWash away the thoughts I made along the way, it all has changed\nYeah, and now we lookin', it's so far away\nAnd it's so far away\n\n[Hook 16]\nThis a civil war\nIt's a fuckin' civil war\nYeah, we be aimin' to the peace\nSo what we killin' for?\nYeah, anymore\nWhat we even livin' for?\nYeah, they be murderin' for peace\nThat is a civil war\n\n[Verse 49]\nYou know- you know they be lookin' at me right now\nLike the sewer system, they about to pipe down\nI've been writin' my essays, my webpage\nYeah, I call that a new construction site now\nBlue's Clues, man, I think I gotta find out\nAll these questions, man, I really wanna hide out\nOr I wanna drop out, maybe learn a lot 'bout\nMy shit before I wait to see it die out\nDamn, I-I just wanna go along\nI'm holdin' strong, I know- I know I'm not the boldest one\nI'm old enough, I'm growin' up, bars so sick, they throwin' up\nThey know what's up, now, I'm in the- now I'm really doin' the\nDoin' in the big leagues like I got drafted\nBefore the year-round hype over March Madness\nWanna get it to where these girls strippin' down\nLike it's no big deal, like we takin' liberal arts classes\nThey be sayin', \"Damn, Ben really got savage\"\nNo, but unlike you, I am not average-\n\n[Interlude 19]\nHold on, I have to fix this fucking instrumental\nThis is so mental, hold on, I have to fix it real quick\nI'm gonna fix it, take a pause\nUh, yeah, ayy\n\n[Verse 50]\nI'm addicted to the screen and the validations\nOf people who are thirteen in another nation\nI've been looking for acceptance in the message\nOr a comment on a video, it seems to be wasted\nLike Internet track meets, they erased it\nLook at this shit, I've just recently made it\nThat how it goes when I'm beatin' and breathin'\nAcheivin' and keep on succeedin', they hate it\nY'all lousy and can't breathe all that smoke, bro\nYou doubt me, but you'll see where I go, so\nAllow me to break free from my own dome\nTo get out and be me, believe in my own zone\nThings become intense in the heat of the ozone\nIt's surroundin' me, I need to go home, so\nCan I pretty please just be al-alone?\nNobody to retweet, delete on my home phone\nI ain't gon'-I ain't gon' hop on that drug shit\nWhen they all claimin' they love it, uh\nI ain't gon' hop on that loud shit\nWhen I know I ain't about it, uh\nYeah, they cannot take this away now\nThey have something to say now\nYou cannot order this shit on a takeout\nAll of

salary\nMan, I said, \"Fuck the peanut gallery, I got a fuckin' allergy\"\nTrappin' out my PayPal, make it Friends and Family\nNow I'm so hot, I need some oven mitts, ain't safe to handle me\nNow I

time?\nTrapped in the back of my mind\nI am so happy to grind, I am so happy to find\nSo much experience now that I'm passing the lines\nNow that I'm grasping the signs\nI have been laughing a lot, got nothing to hide\nNo, I've got nothing to hide\nBitch, I am stuck, left behind\nI need a drive, yeah, I need something to ride\nFill my own bank account, shit that I'm making now\nPuttin' it off to

mastering\nWriting and rapping and making it happen, I'm\nEating my cake, and I'm having it\nReal emotion, I'm tapping in, passionate\nAnd I am working my hardest\nIt's already started, yes, I am

they after\nAnd now they wanna take my place, them backstabbers\nBlucka-blucka, I'ma get you sucker\nWe roll tinted windows, on the black Hummer trucker\nAnd after it rain, you might be dead like Jesse James\nTrained for pain, even when I lose everything I gain\nIt's simple mathematics, review the ballistics\nStatistics show, we breed soldiers in my district\nIt ain't like Mr. Rogers, I learned the game\nBut it wasn't from the Dodgers, it's from pain\nAnd welfare wasn't a question, just a decision\nWe embraced it as a blessing, cause who was missing\nAnd my tattoos tell a story, I'm

is bigger than me\nWatch me shatter while blood spatter, you hear me hey\nI'm putting flowers, on my empty grave damn\nI'm trying to sell a million, so I can provide for my lil' one\nStill won't live blessed, like the rest of the ghetto children\nJust confusing em losing pieces, a broken puzzle\nRussian roulette to my head, the barrel's a bubble muzzle\nI'm kamikaze, you try me yourself right beside me\nI'm a wanted man, call baby mama so she can hide me\nThey only thinking, cause all the brothers locked up in prisons\nGetting letters and pictures, but I know they keep on missing\nTake a ride to Texas, cruising a stolen Lexus\nThe mack 11 is ready, and it's my only protection\nWho I believe in really, I put my faith in God\nI was dealt some bad cards, just fighting in school yards\nDamn, and fighting all night in bars\nThe devil hit me with a murder charge, all he want is murder boyEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1526610",

DE CHARLUS. \u2014 HIS SHAM DUEL. \u2014 THE STATIONS ON THE \u2018TRANSATLANTIC.\u2019\u2014 WEARY OF ALBERTINE I DECIDE TO BREAK WITH HER\n\nI was dropping with sleep. I was taken up to my floor not by the liftboy, but by the squinting page, who to make conversation informed me that his sister was still with the gentleman who was so rich, and that, on one occasion, when she had made up her mind to return home instead of sticking to her business, her gentleman friend had paid a visit to the mother of the squinting page and of the other more fortunate children, who had very soon made the silly creature return to her protector. \u201cYou know, Sir, she\u2019s a fine lady, my sister is. She plays the piano, she talks Spanish. And you would never take her for the sister of the humble employee who brings you up in the lift, she denies herself nothing; Madame has a maid to herself, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised if one day she keeps her carriage. She is very pretty, if you could see her, a little too high and mighty, but, good lord, you can understand that. She\u2019s full of fun. She never leaves a hotel without doing something first in a wardrobe or a drawer, just to leave a little keepsake with the chambermaid who will have to wipe it up. Sometimes she does it in a cab, and after she\u2019s paid her fare, she\u2019ll hide behind a tree, and she doesn\u2019t half laugh when the cabby finds he\u2019s got to clean his cab after her. My father had another stroke of luck when he found my young brother that Indian Prince he used to know long ago. It\u2019s not the same style of thing, of course. But it\u2019s a superb position. The travelling by itself would be a dream. I\u2019m the only one still on the shelf. But you never know. We\u2019re a lucky family; perhaps one day I shall be President of the Republic. But I\u2019m keeping you talking\u201d (I had not uttered a single word and was beginning to fall asleep as I listened to the flow of his). \u201cGood-night, Sir. Oh! Thank you, Sir. If everybody had as kind a heart as you, there wouldn\u2019t be any poor people left. But, as my sister says, \u2018there will always have to be the poor so that now I\u2019m rich I can s \u2014 t on them.\u2019 You\u2019ll pardon the expression. Goodnight, Sir.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps every night we accept the risk of facing, while we are asleep, sufferings which we regard as unreal and unimportant because they will be felt in the course of a sleep which we suppose to be unconscious. And indeed on these evenings when I came back late from la Raspeli\u00e8re I was very sleepy. But after the weather turned cold I could not get to sleep at once, for the fire lighted up the room as though there were a lamp burning in it. Only it was nothing more than a blazing log, and \u2014 like a lamp too, for that matter, like the day when night gathers \u2014 its too bright light was not long in fading; and I entered a state of slumber which is like a second room that we take, into which, leaving our own room, we go when we want to sleep. It has noises of its own and we are sometimes violently awakened by the sound of a bell, perfectly heard by our ears, although nobody has rung. It has its servants, its special visitors who call to take us out so that we are ready to get up when we are compelled to realise, by our almost immediate transmigration into the other room, the room of overnight, that it is empty, that nobody has called\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The race that inhabits it is, like that of our first human ancestors, androgynous. A man in it appears a moment later in the form of a woman. Things in it shew a tendency to turn into men, men into friends and enemies. The time that elapses for the sleeper, during these spells of slumber, is absolutely different from the time in which the life of the waking man is passed. Sometimes its course is far more rapid, a quarter of an hour seems a day, at other times far longer, we think we have taken only a short nap, when we have slept through the day. Then, in the chariot of sleep, we descend into depths in which memory can no longer overtake it, and on the brink of which the mind has been obliged to retrace its steps. The horses of sleep, like those of the sun, move at so steady a pace, in an atmosphere in which there is no longer any resistance, that it requires some little aerolith extraneous to ourselves (hurled from the azure by some Unknown) to strike our regular sleep (which otherwise Would have no reason to stop, and would continue with a similar motion world without end) and to make it swing sharply round, return towards reality, travel without pause, traverse the regions bordering on life in which presently the sleeper will hear the sounds that come from life, quite vague still, but already perceptible, albeit corrupted \u2014 and come to earth suddenly and awake. Then from those profound slumbers we awake in a dawn, not knowing who we are, being nobody, newly born, ready for anything, our brain being emptied of that past which was previously our life. And perhaps it is more pleasant still when our landing at the waking-point is abrupt and the thoughts of our sleep, hidden by a cloak of oblivion, have not time to return to us in order, before sleep ceases. Then, from the black tempest through which we seem to have passed (but we do not even saywe), we emerge prostrate, without a thought, a we that is void of content. What hammer-blow has the person or thing that is lying there received to make it unconscious of anything, stupefied until the moment when memory, flooding back, restores to it consciousness or personality? Moreover, for both these kinds of awakening, we must avoid falling asleep, even into deep slumber, under the law of habit. For everything that habit ensnares in her nets, she watches closely, we must escape her, take our sleep at a moment when we thought we were doing anything else than sleeping, take, in a word, a sleep that does not dwell under the tutelage of foresight, in the company, albeit latent, of reflexion. At least, in these awakenings which I have just described, and which I experienced as a rule when I had been dining overnight at la Raspeli\u00e8re, everything occurred as though by this process, and I can testify to it, I the strange human being who, while he waits for death to release him, lives behind closed shutters, knows nothing of the world, sits motionless as an owl, and like that bird begins to see things a little plainly only when darkness falls. Everything occurs as though by this process, but perhaps only a layer of wadding has prevented the sleeper from taking in the internal dialogue of memories and the incessant verbiage of sleep. For (and this may be equally manifest in the other system, vaster, more mysterious, more astral) at the moment of his entering the waking state, the sleeper hears a voice inside him saying: \u201cWill you come to this dinner to-night, my dear friend, it would be such fun?\u201d and thinks: \u201cYes, what fun it will be, I shall go\u201d; then, growing wider awake, he suddenly remembers: \u201cMy grandmother has only a few weeks to live, the Doctor assures us.\u201d He rings, he weeps at the thought that it will not be, as in the past, his grandmother, his dying grandmother, but an indifferent waiter that will come in answer to his summons. Moreover, when sleep bore him so far away from the world inhabited by memory and thought, through an ether in which he was alone, more than alone; not having that companion in whom we perceive things, ourself, he was outside the range of time and its measures. But now the footman is in the room, and he dares not ask him the time, for he does not know whether he has slept, for how many hours he has slept (he asks himself whether it should not be how many days, returning thus with weary body and mind refreshed, his heart sick for home, as from a journey too distant not to have taken a long time). We may of course insist that there is but one time, for the futile reason that it is by looking at the clock that we have discovered to have been merely a quarter of an hour what we had supposed a day. But at the moment when we make this discovery we are a man awake, plunged in the time of waking men, we have deserted the other time. Perhaps indeed more than another time: another life. The pleasures that we enjoy in sleep, we do not include them in the list of the pleasures that we have felt in the course of our existence. To allude only to the most grossly sensual of them all, which of us, on waking, has not felt a certain irritation at having experienced in his sleep a pleasure which, if he is anxious not to tire himself, he is not, once he is awake, at liberty to repeat indefinitely during the day. It seems a positive waste. We have had pleasure, in another life, which is not ours. Sufferings and pleasures of the dream-world (which generally vanish soon enough after our waking), if we make them figure in a budget, it is not in the current account of our life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two times, I have said; perhaps there is only one after all, not that the time of the waking man has any validity for the sleeper, but perhaps because the other life, the life in which he sleeps, is not \u2014 in its profounder part \u2014 included in the category of time. I came to this conclusion when on the mornings after dinners at la Raspeli\u00e8re I used to lie so completely asleep. For this reason. I was beginning to despair, on waking, when I found that, after I had rung the bell ten times, the waiter did not appear. At the eleventh ring he came. It was only the first after all. The other ten had been mere suggestions in my sleep which still hung about me, of the peal that I had been meaning to sound. My numbed hands had never even moved. Well, on those mornings (and this is what makes me say that sleep is perhaps unconscious of the law of time) my effort to awaken consisted chiefly in an effort to make the obscure, undefined mass of the sleep in which I had just been living enter into the scale of time. It is no easy task; sleep, which does not know whether we have slept for two hours or two days, cannot provide any indication. And if we do not find one outside, not being able to re-enter time, we fall asleep again, for five minutes which seem to us three hours\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have always said \u2014 and have proved by experiment \u2014 that the most powerful soporific is sleep itself. After having slept profoundly for two hours, having fought against so many giants, and formed so many lifelong friendships, it is far more difficult to awake than after taking several grammes of veronal. And so, reasoning from one thing to the other, I was surprised to hear from the Norwegian philosopher, who had it from M. Boutroux, \u201cmy eminent colleague \u2014 pardon me, my brother,\u201d what M. Bergson thought of the peculiar effects upon the memory of soporific drugs. \u201cNaturally,\u201d M. Bergson had said to M. Boutroux, if one was to believe the Norwegian philosopher, \u201csoporifics, taken from time to time in moderate doses, have no effect upon that solid memory of our everyday life which is so firmly established within us. But there are other forms of memory, loftier, but also more unstable. One of my colleagues lectures upon ancient history. He tells me that if, overnight, he has taken a tablet to make him sleep, he has great difficulty, during his lecture, in recalling the Greek quotations that he requires. The doctor who recommended these tablets assured him that they had no effect upon the memory. \u2018That is perhaos because you do not have to quote Greek,\u2019 the historian answered, not without a note of derisive pride.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I cannot say whether this conversation between M. Bergson and M. Boutroux is accurately reported. The Norwegian philosopher, albeit so profound and so lucid, so passionately attentive, may have misunderstood. Personally, in my own experience I have found the opposite result. The moments of oblivion that come to us in the morning after we have taken certain narcotics have a resemblance that is only partial, though disturbing, to the oblivion that reigns during a night of natural and profound sleep. Now what I find myself forgetting in either case is not some line of Baudelaire, which on the other hand keeps sounding in my ear, it is not some concept of one of the philosophers above-named, it is the actual reality of the ordinary things that surround me \u2014 if I am asleep \u2014 my non-perception of which makes me an idiot; it is, if I am awakened and proceed to emerge from an artificial slumber, not the system of Porphyry or Plotinus, which I can discuss as fluently as at any other time, but the answer that I have promised to give to an invitation, the memory of which is replaced by a universal blank. The lofty thought remains in its place; what the soporific has put out of action is the power to act in little things, in everything that demands activity in order to-seize at the right moment, to grasp some memory of everyday life. In spite of all that may be said about survival after the destruction of the brain, I observe that each alteration of the brain is a partial death. We possess all our memories, but not the faculty of recalling them, said, echoing M. Bergson, the eminent Norwegian philosopher whose language I have made no attempt to imitate in order not to prolong my story unduly. But not the faculty of recalling them. But what, then, is a memory which we do not recall? Or, indeed, let us go farther. We do not recall our memories of the last thirty years; but we are wholly steeped in them; why then stop short at thirty years, why not prolong back to before out birth this anterior life? The moment that I do not know a whole section of the memories that are behind me, the moment that they are invisible to me, that I have not the faculty of calling them to me, who can assure me that in that mass unknown to me there are not some that extend back much farther than my human life. If I can have in me and round me so many memories which I do not remember, this oblivion (a de facto oblivion, at least, since I have not the faculty of seeing anything) may extend over a life which I have lived in the body of another man, even upon another planet. A common oblivion effaces all. But what, in that case, signifies that immortality of the soul the reality of which the Norwegian philosopher affirmed? The person that I shall be after death has no more reason to remember the man whom I have been since my birth than the latter to remember what I was before it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The waiter came in. I did not mention to him that I had rung several times, for I was beginning to realise that hitherto I had only dreamed that I was ringing. I was alarmed nevertheless by the thought that this dream had had the clear precision of experience. Experience would, reciprocally, have the irreality of a dream\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead I asked him who it was that had been ringing so often during the night. He told me: \u201cNobody,\u201d and could prove his statement, for the bell-board would have registered any ring. And yet I could hear the repeated, almost furious peals which were still echoing in my ears and were to remain perceptible for several days. It is however seldom that sleep thus projects into our waking life memories that do not perish with it. We can count these aeroliths. If it is an idea that sleep has forged, it soon breaks up into slender, irrecoverable fragments. But, in this instance, sleep had fashioned sounds. More material and simpler, they lasted longer. I was astonished by the relative earliness of the hour, as told me by the waiter. I was none the less refreshed. It is the light sleeps that have a long duration, because, being an intermediate state between waking and sleeping, preserving a somewhat faded but permanent impression of the former, they require infinitely more time to refresh us than a profound sleep, which may be short. I felt quite comfortable for another reason. If remembering that we are tired is enough to make us feel our tiredness, saying to oneself: \u201cI am refreshed,\u201d is enough to create refreshment. Now I had been dreaming that M. de Charlus was a hundred and ten years old, and had just boxed the ears of his own mother, Madame Verdurin, because she had paid five thousand millions for a bunch of violets; I was therefore assured that I had slept profoundly, had dreamed the reverse of what had been in my thoughts overnight and of all the possibilities of life at the moment; this was enough to make me feel entirely refreshed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should greatly have astonished my mother, who could not understand M. de Charlus\u2019s assiduity in visiting the Verdurins, had I told her whom (on the very day on which Albertine\u2019s toque had been ordered, without a word about it to her, in order that it might come as a surprise) M. de Charlus had brought to dine in a private room at the Grand Hotel, Balbec. His guest was none other than the footman of a lady who was a cousin of the Cambremers. This footman was very smartly dressed, and, as he crossed the hall, with the Baron, \u2018did the man of fashion\u2019 as Saint-Loup would have said in the eyes of the visitors. Indeed, the young page-boys, the L\u00e9vites who were swarming down the temple steps at that moment because it was the time when they came on duty, paid no attention to the two strangers, one of whom, M. de Charlus, kept his eyes lowered to shew that he was paying little if any to them. He appeared to be trying to carve his way through their midst. \u201cProsper, dear hope of a sacred nation,\u201d he said, recalling a passage from Racine, and applying to it a wholly different meaning. \u201cPardon?\u201d asked the footman, who was not well up in the classics. M. de Charlus made no reply, for he took a certain pride in never answering questions and in marching straight ahead as though there were no other visitors in the hotel, or no one existed in the world except himself, Baron de Charlus. But, having continued to quote the speech of Josabeth: \u201cCome, come, my children,\u201d he felt a revulsion and did not, like her, add: \u201cBid them approach,\u201d for these young people had not yet reached the age at which sex is completely developed, and which appealed to M. de Charlus. Moreover, if he had written to Madame de Chevregny\u2019s footman, because he had had no doubt of his docility, he had hoped to meet some one more virile. On seeing him, he found him more effeminate than he would have liked. He told him that he had been expecting some one else, for he knew by sight another of Madame de Chevregny\u2019s footmen, whom he had noticed upon the box of her carriage. This was an extremely rustic type of peasant, the very opposite of him who had come, who, on the other hand, regarding his own effeminate ways as adding to his attractiveness, and never doubting that it was this man-of-the-world air that had captivated M. de Charlus, could not even guess whom the Baron meant. \u201cBut there is no one else in the house, except one that you can\u2019t have given the eye to, he is hideous, just like a great peasant.\u201d And at the thought that it was perhaps this rustic whom the Baron had seen, he felt his self-esteem wounded. The Baron guessed this, and, widening his quest: \u201cBut I have not taken a vow that I will know only Mme. de Chevregny\u2019s men,\u201d he said. \u201cSurely there are plenty of fellows in one house or another here or in Paris, since you are leaving soon, that you could introduce to me?\u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d replied the footman, \u201cI never go with anyone of my own class. I only speak to them on duty. But there is one very nice person I can make you know.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d asked the Baron. \u201cThe Prince de Guermantes.\u201d M. de Guermantes was vexed at being offered only a man so advanced in years, one, moreover, to whom he had no need to apply to a footman for an introduction. And so he declined the offer in a dry tone and, not letting himself be discouraged by the menial\u2019s social pretensions, began to explain to him again what he wanted, the style, the type, a jockey, for instance, and so on. . . . Fearing lest the solicitor, who went past at that moment, might have heard them, he thought it cunning to shew that he was speaking of anything in the world rather than what his hearer might suspect, and said with emphasis and in ringing tones, but as though he were simply continuing his conversation: \u201cYes, in spite of my age, I still keep up a passion for collecting, a passion for pretty things, I will do anything to secure an old bronze, an early lustre. I adore the Beautiful.\u201d But to make the footman understand the change of subject he had so rapidly executed, M. de Charlus laid such stress upon each word, and what was more, to be heard by the solicitor, he shouted his words so loud that this charade should in itself have been enough to reveal what it concealed from ears more alert than those of the officer of the court. He suspected nothing, any more than any of the other residents in the hotel, all of whom saw a fashionable foreigner in the footman so smartly attired. On the other hand, if the gentlemen were deceived and took him for a distinguished American, no sooner did he appear before the servants than he was spotted by them, as one convict recognises another, indeed scented afar off, as certain animals scent one another. The head waiters raised their eyebrows. Aim\u00e9 cast a suspicious glance. The wine waiter, shrugging his shoulders, uttered behind his hand (because he thought it polite) an offensive expression which everybody heard. And even our old Fran\u00e7oise, whose sight was failing and who went past at that moment at the foot of the staircase to dine with the courriers, raised her head, recognised a servant where the hotel guests never suspected one \u2014 as the old nurse Euryclea recognises Ulysses long before the suitors seated at the banquet \u2014 and seeing, arm in arm with him, M. de Charlus, assumed an appalled expression, as though all of a sudden slanders which she had heard repeated and had not believed had acquired a heartrending probability in her eyes. She never spoke to me, nor to anyone else, of this incident, but it must have caused a considerable commotion in her brain, for afterwards, whenever in Paris she happened to see \u2018Julien,\u2019 to whom until then she had been so greatly attached, she still treated him with politeness, but with a politeness that had cooled and was always tempered with a strong dose of reserve. This same incident led some one else to confide in me: this was Aim\u00e9. When I encountered M. de Charlus, he, not having expected to meet me, raised his hand and called out \u201cGood evening\u201d with the indifference \u2014 outwardly, at least \u2014 of a great nobleman who believes that everything is allowed him and thinks it better not to appear to be hiding anything. Aim\u00e9, who at that moment was watching him with a suspicious eye and saw that I greeted the companion of the person in whom he was certain that he detected a. servant, asked me that same evening who he was. For, for some time past, Aim\u00e9 had shewn a fondness for talking, or rather, as he himself put it, doubtless in order to emphasise the character \u2014 philosophical, according to him \u2014 of these talks, \u2018discussing\u2019 with me. And as I often said to him that it distressed me that he should have to stand beside the table while I ate instead of being able to sit down and share my meal, he declared that he had never seen a guest shew such \u2018sound reasoning.\u2019 He was talking at that moment to two waiters. They had bowed to me, I did not know why their faces were unfamiliar, albeit their conversation sounded a note which seemed to me not to be novel. Aim\u00e9 was scolding them both because of their matrimonial engagements, of which he disapproved. He appealed to me, I said that I could not have any opinion on the matter since I did not know them. They told me their names, reminded me that they had often waited upon me at Rivebelle. But one had let his moustache grow, the other had shaved his off and had had his head cropped; and for this reason, albeit it was the same head as before that rested upon the shoulders of each of them (and not a different head as in the faulty restorations of Notre-Dame), it had remained almost as invisible to me as those objects which escape the most minute search and are actually staring everybody in the face where nobody notices them, on the mantelpiece. As soon as I knew their names, I recognised exactly the uncertain music of their voices because I saw once more the old face which made it clear. \u201cThey want to get married and they haven\u2019t even learned English!\u201d Aim\u00e9 said to me, without reflecting that I was little versed in the ways of hotel service, and could not be aware that a person who does not know foreign languages cannot be certain of getting a situation. I, who supposed that he would have no difficulty in finding out that the newcomer was M. de Charlus, and indeed imagined that he must remember him, having waited upon him in the dining-room when the Baron came, during my former visit to Balbec, to see Mme. de Villeparisis, I told him his name. Not only did Aim\u00e9 not remember the Baron de Charlus, but the name appeared to make a profound impression upon him. He told me that he would look for a letter next day in his room which I might perhaps be able to explain to him. I was all the more astonished in that M. de Charlus, when he had wished to give me one of Bergotte\u2019s books, at Balbec, the other year, had specially asked for Aim\u00e9, whom he must have recognised later on in that Paris restaurant where I had taken luncheon with Saint-Loup and his mistress and where M. de Charlus had come to spy upon us. It is true that Aim\u00e9 had not been able to execute these commissions in person, being on the former occasion in bed, and on the latter engaged in waiting. I had nevertheless grave doubts as to his sincerity, when he pretended not to know M. de Charlus. For one thing, he must have appealed to the Baron. Like all the upstairs waiters of the Balbec Hotel, like several of the Prince de Guermantes\u2019s footmen, Aim\u00e9 belonged to a race more ancient than that of the Prince, therefore more noble. When you asked for a sitting-room, you thought at first that you were alone. But presently, in the service-room you caught sight of a sculptural waiter, of that ruddy Etruscan kind of which Aim\u00e9 was typical, slightly aged by excessive consumption of champagne and seeing the inevitable hour approach for Contrex\u00e9ville water. Not all the visitors asked them merely to wait upon them. The underlings who were young, conscientious, busy, who had mistresses waiting for them outside, made off. Whereupon Aim\u00e9 reproached them with not being serious. He had every right to do so. He himself was serious. He had a wife and children, and was ambitious on their behalf. And so the advances made to him by a strange lady or gentleman he never repulsed, though it meant his staying all night. For business must come before everything. He was so much of the type that attracted M. de Charlus that I suspected him of falsehood when he told me that he did not know him. I was wrong. The page had been perfectly truthful when he told the Baron that Aim\u00e9 (who had given him a dressing-down for it next day) had gone to bed (or gone out), and on the other occasion was busy waiting. But imagination outreaches reality. And the page-boy\u2019s embarrassment had probably aroused in M. de Charlus doubts as to the sincerity of his excuses that had wounded sentiments of which Aim\u00e9 had no suspicion. We have seen moreover that Saint-Loup had prevented Aim\u00e9 from going out to the carriage in which M. de Charlus, who had managed somehow or other to discover the waiter\u2019s new address, received a further disappointment. Aim\u00e9, who had not noticed him, felt an astonishment that may be imagined when, on the evening of that very day on which I had taken luncheon with Saint-Loup and his mistress, he received a letter sealed with the Guermantes arms, from which I shall quote a few passages here as an example of unilateral insanity in an intelligent man addressing an imbecile endowed with sense. \u201cSir, I have been unsuccessful, notwithstanding efforts that would astonish many people who have sought in vain to be greeted and welcomed by myself, in persuading you to listen to certain explanations which you have not asked of me but which I have felt it to be incumbent upon my dignity and your own to offer you. I am going therefore to write down here what it would have been more easy to say to you in person. I shall not conceal from you that, the first time that I set eyes upon you at Balbec, I found your face frankly antipathetic.\u201d Here followed reflexions upon the resemblance \u2014 remarked only on the following day \u2014 to a deceased friend to whom M. de Charlus had been deeply attached. \u201cThe thought then suddenly occurred to me that you might, without in any way encroaching upon the demands of your profession, come to see me and, by joining me in the card games with which his mirth used to dispel my gloom, give me the illusion that he was not dead. Whatever the nature of the more or less fatuous suppositions which you probably formed, suppositions more within the mental range of a servant (who does not even deserve the name of servant since he has declined to serve) than the comprehension of so lofty a sentiment, you probably thought that you were giving yourself importance, knowing not who I was nor what I was, by sending word to me, when I asked you to fetch me a book, that you were in bed; but it is a mistake to imagine that impolite behaviour ever adds to charm, in which you moreover are entirely lacking. I should have ended matters there had I not, by chance, the following morning, found an opportunity of speaking to you. Your resemblance to my poor friend was so accentuated, banishing even the Intolerable protuberance of your too prominent chin, that I realised that it was the deceased who at that moment was lending you his own kindly expression so as to permit you to regain your hold over me and to prevent you from missing the unique opportunity that was being offered you. Indeed, although I have no wish, since there is no longer any object and it is unlikely that I shall meet you again in this life, to introduce coarse questions of material interest, I should have been only too glad to obey the prayer of my dead friend (for I believe in the Communion of Saints and in their deliberate intervention in the destiny of the living), that I should treat you as I used to treat him, who had his carriage, his servants, and to whom it was quite natural that I should consecrate the greater part of my fortune since I loved him as a father loves his son. You have decided otherwise. To my request that you should fetch me a book you sent the reply that you were obliged to go out. And this morning when I sent to ask you to come to my carriage, you then, if I may so speak without blasphemy, denied me for the third time. You will excuse my not enclosing in this envelope the lavish gratuity which I intended to give you at Balbec and to which it would be too painful to me to restrict myself in dealing with a person with whom I had thought for a moment of sharing all that I possess. At least you might spare me the trouble of making a fourth vain attempt to find you at your restaurant, to which my patience will not extend.\u201d (Here M. de Charlus gave his address, stated the hours at which he would be at home, etc.) \u201cFarewell, Sir. Since I assume that, resembling so strongly the friend whom I have lost, you cannot be entirely stupid, otherwise physiognomy would be a false science, I am convinced that if, one day, you think of this incident again, it will not be without feeling some regret and some remorse. For my part, believe that I am quite sincere in saying that I retain no bitterness. I should have preferred that we should part with a less unpleasant memory than this third futile endeavour. It will soon be forgotten. We are like those vessels which you must often have seen at Balbec, which have crossed one another\u2019s course for a moment; it might have been to the advantage of each of them to stop; but one of them has decided otherwise; presently they will no longer even see one another on the horizon and their meeting is a thing out of mind; but, before this final parting, each of them salutes the other, and so at this point, Sir, wishing you all good fortune, does\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE BARON DE CHARLUS.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aim\u00e9 had not even read this letter through, being able to make nothing of it and suspecting a hoax. When I had explained to him who the Baron was, he appeared to be lost in thought and to be feeling the regret that M. de Charlus had anticipated. I would not be prepared to swear that he would not at that moment have written a letter of apology to a man who gave carriages to his friends. But in the interval M. de Charlus had made Morel\u2019s acquaintance. It was true that, his relations with Morel being possibly Platonic, M. de Charlus occasionally sought to spend an evening in company such as that in which I had just met him in the hall. But he was no longer able to divert from Morel the violent sentiment which, at liberty a few years earlier, had asked nothing better than to fasten itself upon Aim\u00e9 and had dictated the letter which had distressed me, for its writer\u2019s sake, when the head waiter shewed me it. It was, in view of the anti-social nature of M. de Charlus\u2019s love, a more striking example of the insensible, sweeping force of these currents of passion by which the lover, like a swimmer, is very soon carried out of sight of land. No doubt the love of a normal man may also, when the lover, by the successive invention of his desires, regrets, disappointments, plans, constructs a whole romance about a woman whom he does not know, allow the two legs of the compass to gape at a quite remarkably wide angle. All the same, such an angle was singularly enlarged by the character of a passion which is not generally shared and by the difference in social position between M. de Charlus and Aime\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every day I went out with Albertine. She had decided to take up painting again and had chosen as the subject of her first attempts the church of Saint-Jean de la Haise which nobody ever visited and very few had even heard of, a spot difficult to describe, impossible to discover without a guide, slow of access in its isolation, more than half an hour from the Epreville station, after one had long left behind one the last houses of the village of Quetteholme. As to the name Epreville I found that the cur\u00e9\u2018s book and Brichot\u2019s information were at variance. According to one, Epreville was the ancient Sprevilla; the other derived the name from Aprivilla. On our first visit we took a little train in the opposite direction from F\u00e9terne, that is to say towards Grattevast. But we were in the dog days and it had been a terrible strain simply to go out of doors immediately after luncheon. I should have preferred not to start so soon; the luminous and burning air provoked thoughts of indolence and cool retreats. It filled my mother\u2019s room and mine, according to their exposure, at varying temperatures, like rooms in a Turkish bath. Mamma\u2019s dressing-room, festooned by the sun with a dazzling, Moorish whiteness, appeared to be sunk at the bottom of a well, because of the four plastered walls on which it looked out, while far above, in the empty space, the sky, whose fleecy white waves one saw slip past, one behind another, seemed (because of the longing that one felt), whether built upon a terrace or seen reversed in a mirror hung above the window, a tank filled with blue water, reserved for bathers. Notwithstanding this scorching temperature, we had taken the one o\u2019clock train. But Albertine had been very hot in the carriage, hotter still in the long walk across country, and I was afraid of her catching cold when she proceeded to sit still in that damp hollow where the sun\u2019s rays did not penetrate. Having, on the other hand, as long ago as our first visits to Elstir, made up my mind that she would appreciate not merely luxury but even a certain degree of comfort of which her want of money deprived her, I had made arrangements with a Balbec jobmaster that a carriage was to be sent every day to take us out. To escape from the heat we took the road through the forest of Chantepie. The invisibility of the innumerable birds, some of them almost sea-birds, that conversed with one another from the trees on either side of us, gave the same impression of repose that one has when one shuts one\u2019s eyes. By Albertine\u2019s side, enchained by her arms within the carriage, I listened to these Oceanides. And when by chance I caught sight of one of these musicians as he flitted from one leaf to the shelter of another, there was so little apparent connexion between him and his songs that I could not believe that I beheld their cause in the little body, fluttering, humble, startled and unseeing. The carriage could not take us all the way to the church. I stopped it when we had passed through Quetteholme and bade Albertine good-bye. For she had alarmed me by saying to me of this church as of other buildings, of certain pictures: \u201cWhat a pleasure it would be to see that with you!\u201d This pleasure was one that I did not feel myself capable of giving her. I felt it myself in front of beautiful things only if I was alone or pretended to be alone and did not speak. But since she supposed that she might, thanks to me, feel sensations of art which are not communicated thus \u2014 I thought it more prudent to say that I must leave her, would come back to fetch her at the end of the day, but that in the meantime I must go back with the carriage to pay a call on Mme. Verdurin or on the Cambremers, or even spend an hour with Mamma at Balbec, but never farther afield. To begin with, that is to say. For, Albertine having once said to me petulantly: \u201cIt\u2019s a bore that Nature has arranged things so badly and put Saint-Jean de la Haise in one direction, la Raspeli\u00e8re in another, so that you\u2019re imprisoned for the whole day in the part of the country you\u2019ve chosen;\u201d as soon as the toque and veil had come I ordered, to my eventual undoing, a motor-car from Saint-Fargeau (Sanctus Ferreolus, according to the cur\u00e9\u2018s book). Albertine, whom I had kept in ignorance and who had come to call for me, was surprised when she heard in front of the hotel the purr of the engine, delighted when she learned that this motor was for ourselves. I made her come upstairs for a moment to my room. She jumped for joy. \u201cWe are going to pay a call on the Verdurins.\u201d \u201cYes, but you\u2019d better not go dressed like that since you are going to have your motor. There, you will look better in these.\u201d And I brought out the toque and veil which I had hidden. \u201cThey\u2019re for me? Oh! You are an angel,\u201d she cried, throwing her arms round my neck. Aim\u00e9 who met us on the stairs, proud of Albertine\u2019s smart attire and of our means of transport, for these vehicles were still comparatively rare at Balbec, gave himself the pleasure of coming downstairs behind us. Albertine, anxious to display herself in her new garments, asked me to have the car opened, as we could shut it later on when we wished to be more private. \u201cNow then,\u201d said Aim\u00e9 to the driver, with whom he was not acquainted and who had not stirred, \u201cdon\u2019t you (tu) hear, you\u2019re to open your roof?\u201d For Aim\u00e9, sophisticated by hotel life, in which moreover he had won his way to exalted rank, was not as shy as the cab driver to whom Fran\u00e7oise was a \u2018lady\u2019; notwithstanding the want of any formal introduction, plebeians whom he had never seen before he addressed as tu, though it was hard to say whether this was aristocratic disdain on his part or democratic fraternity. \u201cI am engaged,\u201d replied the chauffeur, who did not know me by sight. \u201cI am ordered for Mlle. Simonet. I can\u2019t take this gentleman.\u201d Aim\u00e9 burst out laughing: \u201cWhy, you great pumpkin,\u201d he said to the driver, whom he at once convinced, \u201cthis is Mademoiselle Simonet, and Monsieur, who tells you to open the roof of your car, is the person who has engaged you.\u201d And as Aim\u00e9, although personally he had no feeling for Albertine, was for my sake proud of the garments she was wearing, he whispered to the chauffeur: \u201cDon\u2019t get the chance of driving a Princess like that every day, do you?\u201d On this first occasion it was not I alone that was able to go to la Raspeli\u00e8re as I did on other days, while Albertine painted; she decided to go there with me. She did indeed think that we might stop here and there on our way, but supposed it to be impossible to start by going to Saint-Jean de la Haise. That is to say in another direction, and to make an excursion which seemed to be reserved for a different day. She learned on the contrary from the driver that nothing could be easier than to go to Saint-Jean, which he could do in twenty minutes, and that we might stay there if we chose for hours, or go on much farther, for from Quetteholme to la Raspeli\u00e8re would not take more than thirty-five minutes. We realised this as soon as the vehicle, starting off, covered in one bound twenty paces of an excellent horse. Distances are only the relation of space to time and vary with that relation. We express the difficulty that we have in getting to a place in a system of miles or kilometres which becomes false as soon as that difficulty decreases. Art is modified by it also, when a village which seemed to be in a different world from some other village becomes its neighbour in a landscape whose dimensions are altered. In any case the information that there may perhaps exist a universe in which two and two make five and the straight line is not the shortest way between two points would have astonished Albertine far less than to hear the driver say that it was easy to go in a single afternoon to Saint-Jean and la Raspeli\u00e8re, Douville and Quetteholme, Saint-Mars le Vieux and Saint-Mars le V\u00eatu, Gourville and Old Balbec, Tourville and F\u00e9terne, prisoners hitherto as hermetically confined in the cells of distinct days as long ago were M\u00e9s\u00e9glise and Guermantes, upon which the same eyes could not gaze in the course of one afternoon, delivered now by the giant with the seven-league boots, came and clustered about our tea-time their towers and steeples, their old gardens which the encroaching wood sprang back to reveal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Coming to the foot of the cliff road, the car took it in its stride, with a continuous sound like that of a knife being ground, while the sea falling away grew broader beneath us. The old rustic houses of Montsurvent ran towards us, clasping to their bosoms vine or rose-bush; the firs of la Raspeli\u00e8re, more agitated than when the evening breeze was rising, ran in every direction to escape from us and a new servant whom I had never seen before came to open the door for us on the terrace, while the gardener\u2019s son, betraying a precocious bent, devoured the machine with his gaze. As it was not a Monday we did not know whether we should find Mme. Verdurin, for except upon that day, when ^he was at home, it was unsafe to call upon her without warning. No doubt she was \u2018principally\u2019 at home, but this expression, which Mme. Swann employed at the time when she too was seeking to form her little clan, and to draw visitors to herself without moving towards them, an expression which she interpreted as meaning \u2018on principle,\u2019 meant no more than \u2018as a general rule,\u2019 that is to say with frequent exceptions. For not only did Mme. Verdurin like going out, but she carried her duties as a hostess to extreme lengths, and when she had had people to luncheon, immediately after the coffee, liqueurs and cigarettes (notwithstanding the first somnolent effects of the heat and of digestion in which they would have preferred to watch through the leafy boughs of the terrace the Jersey packet passing over the enamelled sea), the programme included a series of excursions in the course of which her guests, installed by force in carriages, were conveyed, willy-nilly, to look at one or other of the views that abound in the neighbourhood of Douville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This second part of the entertainment was, as it happened (once the effort to rise and enter the carriage had been made), no less satisfactory than the other to the guests, already prepared by the succulent dishes, the vintage wines or sparkling cider to let themselves be easily intoxicated by the purity of the breeze and the magnificence of the views. Mme. Verdurin used to make strangers visit these rather as though they were portions (more or less detached) of her property, which you could not help going to see the moment you came to luncheon with her and which conversely you would never have known had you not been entertained by the Mistress. This claim to arrogate to herself the exclusive right over walks and drives, as over Morel\u2019s and formerly Dechambre\u2019s playing, and to compel the landscapes to form part of the little clan, was not for that matter so absurd as it appears at first sight. Mme. Verdurin deplored the want of taste which, according to her, the Cambremers shewed in the furnishing of la Raspeli\u00e8re and the arrangement of the garden, but still more their want of initiative in the excursions that they took or made their guests take in the surrounding country. Just as, according to her, la Raspeli\u00e8re was only beginning to become what it should always have been now that it was the asylum of the little clan, so she insisted that the Cambremers, perpetually exploring in their barouche, along the railway line, by the shore, the one ugly road that there was in the district, had been living in the place all their lives but did not know it. There was a grain of truth in this assertion. From force of habit, lack of imagination, want of interest in a country which seemed hackneyed because it was so near, the Cambremers when they left their home went always to the same places and by the same roads. To be sure they laughed heartily at the Verdurins\u2019 offer to shew them their native country. But when it came to that, they and even their coachman would have been incapable of taking us to the splendid, more or less secret places, to which M. Verdurin brought us, now forcing the barrier of a private but deserted property upon which other people would not have thought it possible to venture, now leaving the carriage to follow a path which was not wide enough for wheeled traffic, but in either case with the certain recompense of a marvellous view. Let us say in passing that the garden at la Raspeli\u00e8re was in a sense a compendium of all the excursions to be made in a radius of many miles. For one thing because of its commanding position, overlooking on one side the valley, on the other the sea, and also because, on one and the same side, the seaward side for instance, clearings had been made through the trees in such a way that from one point you embraced one horizon, from another another. There was at each of these points of view a bench; you went and sat down in turn upon the bench from which there was the view of Balbec, or Parville, or Douville. Even to command a single view one bench would have been placed more or less on the edge of the cliff, another farther back. From the latter you had a foreground of verdure and a horizon which seemed already the vastest imaginable, but which became infinitely larger if, continuing along a little path, you went to the next bench from which you scanned the whole amphitheatre of the sea. There you could make out exactly the sound of the waves which did not penetrate to the more secluded parts of the garden, where the sea was still visible but no longer audible. These resting-places bore at la Raspeli\u00e8re among the occupants of the house the name of \u2018views.\u2019 And indeed they assembled round the mansion the finest views of the neighbouring places, coastline or forest, seen greatly diminished by distance, as Hadrian collected in his villa reduced models of the most famous monuments of different countries. The name that followed the word \u2018view\u2019 was not necessarily that of a place on the coast, but often that of the opposite shore of the bay which you could make out, standing out in a certain relief notwithstanding the extent of the panorama. Just as you took a book from M. Verdurin\u2019s library to go and read for an hour at the \u2018view of Balbec,\u2019 so if the sky was clear the liqueurs would be served at the \u2018view of Rivebelle,\u2019 on condition however that the wind was not too strong, for, in spite of the trees planted on either side, the air up there was keen. To come back to the carriage parties that Mme. Verdurin used to organise for the afternoons, the Mistress, if on her return she found the cards of some social butterfly \u2018on a flying visit to the coast,\u2019 would pretend to be overjoyed, but was actually broken-hearted at having missed his visit and (albeit people at this date came only to \u2018see the house\u2019 or to make the acquaintance for a day of a woman whose artistic salon was famous, but outside the pale in Paris) would at once make M. Verdurin invite him to dine on the following Wednesday. As the tourist was often obliged to leave before that day, or was afraid to be out late, Mme. Verdurin had arranged that on Mondays she was always to be found at teatime. These tea-parties were not at all large, and I had known more brilliant gatherings of the sort in Paris, at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s, at Mme. de Gallifet\u2019s or Mme. d\u2019Arpajon\u2019s. But this was not Paris, and the charm of the setting enhanced, in my eyes, not merely the pleasantness of the party but the merits of the visitors. A meeting with some social celebrity, which in Paris would have given me no pleasure, but which at la Raspeli\u00e8re, whither he had come from a distance by F\u00e9terne or the forest of Chantepie, changed in character, in importance, became an agreeable incident. Sometimes it was a person whom I knew quite well and would not have gone a yard to meet at the Swanns\u2019. But his name sounded differently upon this cliff, like the name of an actor whom one has constantly heard in a theatre, printed upon the announcement, in a different colour, of an extraordinary gala performance, where his notoriety is suddenly multiplied by the unexpectedness of the rest. As in the country people behave without ceremony, the social celebrity often took it upon him to bring the friends with whom he was staying, murmuring the excuse in Mme. Verdurin\u2019s ear that he could not leave them behind as he was living in their house; to his hosts on the other hand he pretended to offer, as a sort of courtesy, the distraction, in a monotonous seaside life, of being taken to a centre of wit and intellect, of visiting a magnificent mansion and of making an excellent tea. This composed at once an assembly of several persons of semi-distinction; and if a little slice of garden with a few trees, which would seem shabby in the country, acquires an extraordinary charm in the Avenue Gabriel or let us say the Rue de Monceau, where only multi-millionaires can afford such a luxury, inversely gentlemen who are of secondary importance at a Parisian party stood out at their full value on a Monday afternoon at la Raspeli\u00e8re. No sooner did they sit down at the table covered with a cloth embroidered in red, beneath the painted panels, to partake of the rock cakes, Norman puff pastry, tartlets shaped like boats filled with cherries like beads of coral, \u2018diplomatic\u2019 cakes, than these guests were subjected, by the proximity of the great bowl of azure upon which the window opened, and which you could not help seeing when you looked at them, to a profound alteration, a transmutation which changed them into something more precious than before. What was more, even before you set eyes on them, when you came on a Monday to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, people who in Paris would scarcely turn their heads to look, so familiar was the sight of a string of smart carriages waiting outside a great house, felt their hearts throb at the sight of the two or three broken-down dog-carts drawn up in front of la Raspeli\u00e8re, beneath the tall firs. No doubt this was because the rustic setting was different, and social impressions thanks to this transposition regained a kind of novelty. It was also because the broken-down carriage that one hired to pay a call upon Mme. Verdurin called to mind a pleasant drive and a costly bargain struck with a coachman who had demanded \u2018so much\u2019 for the whole day. But the slight stir of curiosity with regard to fresh arrivals, whom it was still impossible to distinguish, made everybody ask himself: \u201cWho can this be?\u201d a question which it was difficult to answer, when one did not know who might have come down to spend a week with the Cambremers or elsewhere, but which people always enjoy putting to themselves in rustic, solitary lives where a meeting with a human creature whom one has not seen for a long time ceases to be the tiresome affair that it is in the life of Paris, and forms a delicious break in the empty monotony of lives that are too lonely, in which even the postman\u2019s knock becomes a pleasure. And on the day on which we arrived in a motor-car at la Raspeli\u00e8re, as it was not Monday, M. and Mme. Verdurin must have been devoured by that craving to see people which attacks men and women and inspires a longing to throw himself out of the window in the patient who has been shut up away from his family and friends, for a cure of strict isolation. For the new and more swift-footed servant, who had already made himself familiar with these expressions, having replied that \u201cif Madame has not gone out she must be at the view of Douville,\u201d and that he would go and look for her, came back immediately to tell us that she was coming to welcome us. We found her slightly dishevelled, for she came from the flower beds, farmyard and kitchen garden, where she had gone to feed her peacocks and poultry, to hunt for eggs, to gather fruit and flowers to \u2018make her table-centre,\u2019 which would suggest her park in miniature; but on the table it conferred the distinction of making it support the burden of only such things as were useful and good to eat; for round those other presents from the garden which were the pears, the whipped eggs, rose the tall stems of bugloss, carnations, roses and coreopsis, between which one saw, as between blossoming boundary posts, move from one to another beyond the glazed windows, the ships at sea. From the astonishment which M. and Mme. Verdurin, interrupted while arranging their flowers to receive the visitors that had been announced, shewed upon finding that these visitors were merely Albertine and myself, it was easy to see that the new servant, full of zeal but not yet familiar with my name, had repeated it wrongly and that Mme. Verdurin, hearing the names of guests whom she did not know, had nevertheless bidden him let them in, in her need of seeing somebody, no matter whom. And the new servant stood contemplating this spectacle from the door in order to learn what part we played in the household. Then he made off at a run, taking long strides, for he had entered upon his duties only the day before. When Albertine had quite finished displaying her toque and veil to the Verdurins, she gave me a warning look to remind me that we had not too much time left for what we meant to do. Mme. Verdurin begged us to stay to tea, but we refused, when all of a sudden a suggestion was mooted which would have made an end of all the pleasures that I promised myself from my drive with Albertine: the Mistress, unable to face the thought of tearing herself from us, or perhaps of allowing a novel distraction to escape, decided to accompany us. Accustomed for years past to the experience that similar offers on her part were not well received, and being probably dubious whether this offer would find favour with us, she concealed beneath an excessive assurance the timidity that she felt when addressing us and, without even appearing to suppose that there could be any doubt as to our answer, asked us no question, but said to her husband, speaking of Albertine and myself, as though she were conferring a favour on us: \u201cI shall see them home, myself.\u201d At the same time there hovered over her lips a smile that did not belong to them, a smile which I had already seen on the faces of certain people when they said to Bergotte with a knowledgeable air: \u201cI have bought your book, it\u2019s not bad,\u201d one of those collective, universal smiles which, when they feel the need of them \u2014 as we make use of railways and removal vans \u2014 individuals borrow, except a few who are extremely refined, like Swann or M. de Charlus on whose lips I have never seen that smile settle. From that moment my visit was poisoned. I pretended not to have understood. A moment later it became evident that M. Verdurin was to be one of the party. \u201cBut it will be too far for M. Verdurin,\u201d I objected. \u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin with a condescending, cheerful air, \u201che says it will amuse him immensely to go with you young people over a road he has travelled so many times; if necessary, he will sit beside the engineer, that doesn\u2019t frighten him, and we shall come back quietly by the train like a good married couple. Look at him, he\u2019s quite delighted.\u201d She seemed to be speaking of an aged and famous painter full of friendliness, who, younger than the youngest, takes a delight in scribbling figures on paper to make his grandchildren laugh. What added to my sorrow was that Albertine seemed not to share it and to find some amusement in the thought of dashing all over the countryside like this with the Verdurins. As for myself, the pleasure that I had vowed that I would take with her was so imperious that I refused to allow the Mistress to spoil it; I invented falsehoods which the irritating threats of Mme. Verdurin made excusable, but which Albertine, alas, contradicted. \u201cBut we have a call to pay,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat call?\u201d asked Albertine. \u201cYou shall hear about it later, there\u2019s no getting out of it.\u201d \u201cVery well, we can wait outside,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, resigned to anything. At the last minute my anguish at seeing wrested from me a happiness for which I had so longed gave me the courage to be impolite. I refused point blank, alleging in Mme. Verdurin\u2019s ear that because of some trouble which had befallen Albertine and about which she wished to consult me, it was absolutely necessary that I should be alone with her. The Mistress appeared vexed: \u201cAll right, we shan\u2019t come,\u201d she said to me in a voice tremulous with rage. I felt her to be so angry that, so as to appear to be giving way a little: \u201cBut we might perhaps . . . \u201d I began. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied, more furious than ever, \u201cwhen I say no, I mean no.\u201d I supposed that I was out of favour with her, but she called us back at the door to urge us not to \u2018fail\u2019 on the following Wednesday, and not to come with that contraption, which was dangerous at night, but by the train with the little group, and she made me stop the car, which was moving down hill across the park, because the footman had forgotten to put in the hood the slice of tart and the shortbread which she had had made into a parcel for us. We started off, escorted for a moment by the little houses that came running to meet us with their flowers. The face of the countryside seemed to us entirely changed, so far, in the topographical image that we form in our minds of separate places, is the notion of space from being the most important factor. We have said that the notion of time segregates them even farther. It is not the only factor either. Certain places which we see always in isolation seem to us to have no common measure with the rest, to be almost outside the world, like those people whom we have known in exceptional periods of our life, during our military service, in our childhood, and whom we associate with nothing. In my first year at Balbec there was a piece of high ground to which Mme. de Villeparisis liked to take us because from it you saw only the water and the woods, and which was called Beaumont. As the road that she took to approach it, and preferred to other routes because of its old trees, went up hill all the way, her carriage was obliged to go at a crawling pace and took a very long time. When we reached the top we used to alight, stroll about for a little, get into the carriage again, return by the same road, without seeing a single village, a single country house. I knew that Beaumont was something very special, very remote, very high, I had no idea of the direction in which it was to be found, having never taken the Beaumont road to go anywhere else; besides, it took a very long time to get there in a carriage. It was obviously in the same Department (or in the same Province) as Balbec, but was situated for me on another plane, enjoyed a special privilege of extra-territoriality. But the motor-car respects no mystery, and, having passed beyond Incarville, whose houses still danced before my eyes, as we were going down the cross road that leads to Parville (Paterni villa), catching sight of the sea from a natural terrace over which we were passing, I asked the name of the place, and before the chauffeur had time to reply recognised Beaumont, close by which I passed thus unconsciously whenever I took the little train, for it was within two minutes of Parville. Like an officer of my regiment who might have seemed to me a creature apart, too kindly and simple to be of a great family, too remote already and mysterious to be simply of a great family, and of whom I was afterwards to learn that he was the brother-in-law, the cousin of people with whom I was dining, so Beaumont, suddenly brought in contact with places from which I supposed it to be so distinct, lost its mystery and took its place in the district, making me think with terror that Madame Bovary and the Sanseverina might perhaps have seemed to me to be like ordinary people, had I met them elsewhere than in the close atmosphere of a novel. It may be thought that my love of magic journeys by train ought to have prevented me from sharing Albertine\u2019s wonder at the motor-car which takes even the invalid wherever he wishes to go and destroys our conception \u2014 which I had held hitherto \u2014 of position in space as the individual mark, the irreplaceable essence of irremovable beauties. And no doubt this position in space was not to the motor-car, as it had been to the railway train, when I came from Paris to Balbec, a goal exempt from the contingencies of ordinary life, almost ideal at the moment of departure, and, as it remains so at that of arrival, at our arrival in that great dwelling where no one dwells and which bears only the name of the town, the station, seeming to promise at last the accessibility of the town, as though the station were its materialisation. No, the motor-car did not convey us thus by magic into a town which we saw at first in the whole that is summarised by ite name, and with the illusions of a spectator in a theatre. It made us enter that theatre by the wings which were the streets, stopped to ask the way of an inhabitant. But, as a compensation for so familiar a progress one has the gropings of the chauffeur uncertain of his way and retracing his course, the \u2018general post\u2019 of perspective which sets a castle dancing about with a hill, a church and the sea, while one draws nearer to it, in spite of its vain efforts to hide beneath its primeval foliage; those ever narrowing circles which the motor-car describes round a spellbound town which darts off in every direction to escape it and upon which finally it drops down, straight, into the heart of the valley where it lies palpitating on the ground; so that this position in space, this unique point, which the motor-car seems to have stripped of the mystery of express trains, it gives us on the contrary the impression of discovering, of determining for ourselves as with a compass, of helping us to feel with a more fondly exploring hand, with a finer precision, the true geometry, the fair measure of the earth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What unfortunately I did not know at that moment and did not learn until more than two years later was that one of the chauffeur\u2019s patrons was M. de Charlus, and that Morel, instructed to pay him and keeping part of the money for himself (making the chauffeur triple and quintuple the mileage), had become very friendly with him (while pretending not to know him before other people) and made use of his car for long journeys. If I had known this at the time, and that the confidence which the Verdurins were presently to feel in this chauffeur came, unknown to them, from that source, perhaps many of the sorrows of my life in Paris, in the year that followed, much of my trouble over Albertine would have been avoided, but I had not the slightest suspicion of it. In themselves M. de Charlus\u2019s excursions by motor-car with Morel were of no direct interest to me. They were moreover confined as a rule to a luncheon or dinner in some restaurant along the coast where M. de Charlus was regarded as an old and penniless servant and Morel, whose duty it was to pay the bill, as a too kind-hearted gentleman. I report the conversation at one of these meals, which may give an idea of the others. It was in a restaurant of elongated shape at Saint-Mars le V\u00eatu. \u201cCan\u2019t you get them to remove this thing?\u201d M. de Charlus asked Morel, as though appealing to an intermediary without having to address the staff directly. \u2018This thing\u2019 was a vase containing three withered roses with which a well-meaning head waiter had seen fit to decorate the table. \u201cYes . . . \u201d said Morel in embarrassment. \u201cYou don\u2019t like roses?\u201d \u201cMy request ought on the contrary to prove that I do like them, since there are no roses here\u201d (Morel appeared surprised) \u201cbut as a matter of fact I do not care much for them. I am rather sensitive to names; and whenever a rose is at all beautiful, one learns that it is called Baronne de Rothschild or Mar\u00e9chale Niel, which casts a chill. Do you like names? Have you found beautiful titles for your little concert numbers?\u201d \u201cThere is one that is called Po\u00e8me triste.\u201d \u201cThat is horrible,\u201d replied M. de Charlus in a shrill voice that rang out like a blow. \u201cBut I ordered champagne?\u201d he said to the head waiter who had supposed he was obeying the order by placing by the diners two glasses of foaming liquid. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d \u201cTake away that filth, which has no connexion with the worst champagne in the world. It is the emetic known as cup, which consists, as a rule, of three rotten strawberries swimming in a mixture of vinegar and soda-water. Yes,\u201d he went on, turning again to Morel, \u201cyou don\u2019t seem to know what a title is. And even in the interpretation of the things you play best, you seem not to be aware of the mediumistic side.\u201d \u201cYou mean to say?\u201d asked Morel, who, not having understood one word of what the Baron had said, was afraid that he might be missing something of importance, such as an invitation to luncheon. M. de Charlus having failed to regard \u201cYou mean to say?\u201d as a question, Morel, having in Consequence received no answer, thought it best to change the conversation and to give it a sensual turn: \u201cThere, look at the fair girl selling the flowers you don\u2019t like; I\u2019m certain she\u2019s got a little mistress. And the old woman dining at the table at the end, too.\u201d \u201cBut how do you know all that?\u201d asked M. de Charlus, amazed at Morel\u2019s intuition. \u201cOh! I can spot them in an instant. If we went out together in a crowd, you would see that I never make a mistake.\u201d And anyone looking at Morel at that moment, with his girlish air enshrined in his masculine beauty, would have understood the obscure divination which made him no less obvious to certain women than them to him. He was anxious to supplant Jupien, vaguely desirous of adding to his regular income the profits which, he supposed, the tailor derived from the Baron. \u201cAnd with boys I am surer still, I could save you from making any mistake. We shall be having the fair soon at Balbec, we shall find lots of things there. And in Paris too, you\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll have a fine time.\u201d But the inherited caution of a servant made him give a different turn to the sentence on which he had already embarked. So that M. de Charlus supposed that he was still referring to girls. \u201cListen,\u201d said Morel, anxious to excite in a fashion which he considered less compromising for himself (albeit it was actually more immoral) the Baron\u2019s senses, \u201cwhat I should like would be to find a girl who was quite pure, make her fall in love with me, and take her virginity.\u201d M. de Charlus could not refrain from pinching Morel\u2019s ear affectionately, but added innocently: \u201cWhat good would that be to you? If you took her maidenhead, you would be obliged to marry her.\u201d \u201cMarry her?\u201d cried Morel, guessing that the Baron was fuddled, or else giving no thought to the man, more scrupulous in reality than he supposed, to whom he was speaking. \u201cMarry her? Balls! I should promise, but once the little operation was performed, I should clear out and leave her.\u201d M. de Charlus was in the habit, when a fiction was capable of causing him a momentary sensual pleasure, of believing in its truth, while keeping himself free to withdraw his credulity altogether a minute later, when his pleasure was at an end. \u201cYou would really do that?\u201d he said to Morel with a laugh, squeezing him more tightly still. \u201cAnd why not?\u201d said Morel, seeing that he was not shocking the Baron by continuing to expound to him what was indeed one of his desires. \u201cIt is dangerous,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cI should have my kit packed and ready, and buzz off and leave no address.\u201d \u201cAnd what about me?\u201d asked M. de Charlus. \u201cI should take you with me, of course,\u201d Morel made haste to add, never having thought of what would become of the Baron who was the least of his responsibilities. \u201cI say, there\u2019s a kid I should love to try that game on, she\u2019s a little seamstress who keeps a shop in M. le Due\u2019s h\u00f4tel.\u201d \u201cJupien\u2019s girl,\u201d the Baron exclaimed, as the wine-waiter entered the room. \u201cOh! Never,\u201d he added, whether because the presence of a third person had cooled his ardour, or because even in this sort of black mass in which he took a delight in defiling the most sacred things, he could not bring himself to allow the mention of people to whom he was bound by ties of friendship. \u201cJupien is a good man, the child is charming, it would be a shame to make them unhappy.\u201d Morel felt that he had gone too far and was silent, but his gaze continued to fix itself in imagination upon the girl for whose benefit he had once begged me to address him as \u2018dear great master\u2019 and from whom he had ordered a waistcoat. An industrious worker, the child had not taken any holiday, but I learned afterwards that while the violinist was in the neighbourhood of Balbec she never ceased to think of his handsome face, ennobled by the accident that having seen Morel in my company she had taken him for a \u2018gentleman.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI never heard Chopin play,\u201d said the Baron, \u201cand yet I might have done so, I took lessons from Stamati, but he forbade me to go and hear the Master of the Nocturnes at my aunt Chimay\u2019s.\u201d \u201cThat was damned silly of him,\u201d exclaimed Morel. \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d M. de Charlus retorted warmly, in a shrill voice. \u201cHe shewed his intelligence. He had realised that I had a \u2018nature\u2019 and that I would succumb to Chopin\u2019s influence. It made no difference, because when I was quite young I gave up music, and everything else, for that matter. Besides one can more or less imagine him,\u201d he added in a slow, nasal, drawling tone, \u201cthere are still people who did hear him, who can give you an idea. However, Chopin was only an excuse to come back to the mediumistic aspect which you are neglecting.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reader will observe that, after an interpolation of common parlance, M. de Charlus had suddenly become as precious and haughty in his speech as ever. The idea of Morel\u2019s \u2018dropping\u2019 without compunction a girl whom he had outraged had given him a sudden and entire pleasure. From that moment his sensual appetites were satisfied for a time and the sadist (a true medium, he, if you like) who had for a few moments taken the place of M. de Charlus had fled, leaving a clear field for the real M. de Charlus, full of artistic refinement, sensibility, goodness. \u201cYou were playing the other day the transposition for the piano of the Fifteenth Quartet, which is absurd in itself because nothing could be less pianistic. It is meant for people whose ears are hurt by the too highly strained chords of the glorious Deaf One. Whereas it is precisely that almost bitter mysticism that is divine. In any case you played it very badly and altered all the movements. You ought to play it as though you were composing it: the young Morel, afflicted with a momentary deafness and with a non-existent genius stands for an instant motionless. Then, seized by the divine frenzy, he plays, he composes the opening bars. After which, exhausted by this initial effort, he gives way, letting droop his charming forelock to please Mme. Verdur\u00een, and, what is more, gives himself time to recreate the prodigious quantity of grey matter which he has commandeered for the Pythian objectivation. Then, having regained his strength, seized by a fresh and overmastering inspiration, he flings himself upon the sublime, imperishable phrase which the virtuoso of Berlin\u201d (we suppose M. de Charlus to have meant by this expression Mendelssohn) \u201cwas to imitate without ceasing. It is in this, the only really transcendent and animating fashion, that I shall make you play in Paris.\u201d When M. de Charlus gave him advice of this sort, Morel was far more alarmed than when he saw the head waiter remove his scorned roses and \u2018cup,\u2019 for he asked himself with anxiety what effect it would create among his \u2018class.\u2019 But he was unable to dwell upon these reflexions, for M. de Charlus said to him imperiously: \u201cAsk the head waiter if he has a Bon Chr\u00e9tien.\u201d \u201cA good Christian, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t you see we\u2019ve reached the dessert, it\u2019s a pear. You may be sure, Mme. de Cambremer has them in her garden, for the Comtesse d\u2019Escarbagnas whose double she is had them. M. Thibaudier sends her them, saying: \u2018Here is a Bon Chr\u00e9tien which is worth tasting.\u2019\u201d \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cI can see that you know nothing. If you have never even read Moli\u00e8re. . . . Oh, well, since you are no more capable of ordering food than of anything else, ask simply for a pear which is grown in this neighbourhood, the Louise-Bonne d\u2019Avranches.\u201d \u201cThe?\u201d \u201cWait a minute, since you are so stupid, I shall ask him myself for others, which I prefer. Waiter, have you any Doyenn\u00e9e des Cornices? Charlie, you must read the exquisite passage about that pear by the Duchesse Emilie de Clermont-Tonnerre.\u201d \u201cNo, Sir, there aren\u2019t any.\u201d \u201cHave you Triomphe de Jodoigne?\u201d \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d \u201cAny Virginie-Dallet? Or Passe-Colmar? No? Very well, since you\u2019ve nothing, we may as well go. The Duchesse d\u2019Angoul\u00eame is not in season yet, come along, Charlie.\u201d Unfortunately for M. de Charlus, his want of common sense, perhaps too the chastity of what were probably his relations with Morel, made him go out of his way at this period to shower upon the violinist strange bounties which the other was incapable of understanding, and to which his nature, impulsive in its own way, but mean and ungrateful, could respond only by a harshness or a violence that were steadily intensified and plunged M. de Charlus \u2014 formerly so proud, now quite timid \u2014 in fits of genuine despair. We shall see how, in the smallest matters, Morel, who fancied himself a M. de Charlus a thousand times more important, completely misunderstood, by taking it literally, the Baron\u2019s arrogant information with regard to the aristocracy. Let us for the moment say simply this, while Albertine waits for me at Saint-Jean de la Haise, that if there was one thing which Morel set above nobility (and this was in itself distinctly noble, especially in a person whose pleasure was to pursue little girls \u2014 on the sly \u2014 with the chauffeur), it was his artistic reputation and what the others might think of him in the violin class. No doubt it was an ugly trait in his character that because he felt M. de Charlus to be entirely devoted to him he appeared to disown him, to make fun of him, in the same way as, when I had promised not to reveal the secret of his father\u2019s position with my great-uncle, he treated me with contempt. But on the other hand his name, as that of a recognised artist, Morel, appeared to him superior to a \u2018name.\u2019 And when M. de Charlus, in his dreams of Platonic affection, tried to make him adopt one of his family titles, Morel stoutly refused\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Albertine thought it better to remain at Saint-Jean de la Haise and paint, I would take the car, and it was not merely to Gourville and F\u00e9terne, but to Saint-Mars le V\u00eatu and as far as Criquetot that I was able to penetrate before returning to fetch her. While pretending to be occupied with anything rather than herself, and to be obliged to forsake her for other pleasures, I thought only of her. As often as not I went no farther than the great plain which overlooks Gourville, and as it resembles slightly the plain that begins above Combray, in the direction of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, even at a considerable distance from Albertine, I had the joy of thinking that if my gaze could not reach her, still, travelling farther than in my vision, that strong and gentle sea breeze which was sweeping past me must be flowing down, without anything to arrest it as far as Quetteholme, until it stirred the branches of the trees that bury Saint-Jean de la Haise in their foliage, caressing the face of my mistress, and must thus be extending a double tie between her and myself in this retreat indefinitely enlarged, but without danger, as in those games in which two children find themselves momentarily out of sight and earshot of one another, and yet, while far apart, remain together. I returned by those roads from which there is a view of the sea, and on which in the past, before it appeared among the branches, I used to shut my eyes to reflect that what I was going to see was indeed the plaintive ancestress of the earth, pursuing as in the days when no living creature yet existed its lunatic, immemorial agitation. Now, these roads were no longer, simply the means of rejoining Albertine; when I recognised each of them in their uniformity, knowing how far they would run in a straight line, where they would turn, I remembered that I had followed them while I thought of Mlle, de Stermaria, and also that this same eagerness to find Albertine I had felt in Paris as I walked the streets along which Mme. de Guermantes might pass; they assumed for me the profound monotony, the moral significance of a sort of ruled line that my character must follow. It was natural, and yet it was not without importance; they reminded me that it was my fate to pursue only phantoms, creatures whose reality existed to a great extent in my imagination; there are people indeed \u2014 and this had been my case from my childhood \u2014 for whom all the things that have a fixed value, assessable by others, fortune, success, high positions, do not count; what they must have, is phantoms. They sacrifice all the rest, leave no stone unturned, make everything else subservient to the capture of some phantom. But this soon fades away; then they run after another, prepared to return later on to the first. It was not the first time that I had gone in quest of Albertine, the girl I had seen that first year outlined against the sea. Other women, it is true, had been interposed between the Albertine whom I had first loved and her from whom I was scarcely separated at this moment; other women, notably the Duchesse de Guermantes. But, the reader will say, why give yourself so much anxiety with regard to Gilberte, take so much trouble over Madame de Guermantes, if, when you have become the friend of the latter, it is with the sole result of thinking no more of her, but only of Albertine? Swann, before his own death, might have answered the question, he who had been a lover of phantoms. Of phantoms pursued, forgotten, sought afresh sometimes for a single meeting and in order to establish contact with an unreal life which at once escaped, these Balbec roads were full. When I thought that their trees, pear trees, apple trees, tamarisks, would outlive me, I seemed to receive from them the warning to set myself to work at last, before the hour should strike of rest everlasting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I left the carriage at Quetteholme, ran down the sunken path, crossed the brook by a plank and found Albertine painting in front of the church all spires and crockets, thorny and red, blossoming like a rose bush. The lantern alone shewed an unbroken front; and the smiling surface of the stone was abloom with angels who continued, before the twentieth century couple that we were, to celebrate, taper in hand, the ceremonies of the thirteenth. It was they that Albertine was endeavouring to portray on her prepared canvas, and, imitating Elstir, she was laying on the paint in sweeping strokes, trying to obey the noble rhythm set, the great master had told her, by those angels so different from any that he knew. Then she collected her things. Leaning upon one another we walked back up the sunken path, leaving the little church, as quiet as though it had never seen us, to listen to the perpetual sound of the brook. Presently the car started, taking us home by a different way. We passed Marcouville l\u2019Orgueilleuse. Over its church, half new, half restored, the setting sun spread its patina as fine as that of centuries. Through it the great has-reliefs seemed to be visible only through a floating layer, half liquid, half luminous; the Blessed Virgin, Saint Elizabeth, Saint Joachim swam in the impalpable tide, almost on dry land, on the water\u2019s or the sunlight\u2019s surface. Rising in a warm dust, the many modern statues reached, on their pillars, halfway up the golden webs of sunset. In front of the church a tall cypress seemed to be in a sort of consecrated enclosure. We left the car for a moment to look at it and strolled for a little. No less than of her limbs, Albertine was directly conscious of her toque of Leghorn straw and of the silken veil (which were for her the source of no less satisfaction), and derived from them, as we strolled round the church, a different sort of impetus, revealed by a contentment which was inert but in which I found a certain charm; veil and toque which were but a recent, adventitious part of my friend, but a part that was already dear to me, as I followed its trail with my eyes, past the cypress in the evening air. She herself could not see it, but guessed that the effect was pleasing, for she smiled at me, harmonising the poise of her head with the headgear that completed it. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s restored,\u201d she said to me, pointing to the church and remembering what Elstir had said to her about the priceless, inimitable beauty of old stone. Albertine could tell a restoration at a glance. One could not help feeling surprised at the sureness of the taste she had already acquired in architecture, as contrasted with the deplorable taste she still retained in music. I cared no more than Elstir for this church, it was with no pleasure to myself that its sunlit front had come and posed before my eyes, and I had got out of the car to examine it only out of politeness to Albertine. I found, however, that the great impressionist had contradicted himself; why exalt this fetish of its objective architectural value, and not take into account the transfiguration of the church by the sunset? \u201cNo, certainly not,\u201d said Albertine, \u201cI don\u2019t like it; I like its name orgueilleuse. But what I must remember to ask Brichot is why Saint-Mars is called le V\u00eatu. We shall be going there next, shan\u2019t we?\u201d she said, gazing at me out of her black eyes over which her toque was pulled down, like her little polo cap long ago. Her veil floated behind her. I got back into the car with her, happy in the thought that we should be going next day to Saint-Mars, where, in this blazing weather when one could think only of the delights of a bath, the two ancient steeples, salmon-pink, with their lozenge-shaped tiles, gaping slightly as though for air, looked like a pair of old, sharp-snouted fish, coated in scales, moss-grown and red, which without seeming to move were rising in a blue, transparent water. On leaving Marcouville, to shorten the road, we turned aside at a crossroads where there is a farm. Sometimes Albertine made the car stop there and asked me to go alone to fetch, so that she might drink it in the car, a bottle of calvados or cider, which the people assured me was not effervescent, and which proceeded to drench us from head to foot. We sat pressed close together. The people of the farm could scarcely see Albertine in the closed car, I handed them back their bottles; we moved on again, as though to continue that private life by ourselves, that lovers\u2019 existence which they might suppose us to lead, and of which this halt for refreshment had been only an insignificant moment; a supposition that would have appeared even less far-fetched if they had seen us after Albertine had drunk her bottle of cider; she seemed then positively unable to endure the existence of an interval between herself and me which as a rule did not trouble her; beneath her linen skirt her legs were pressed against mine, she brought close against my cheeks her own cheeks which had turned pale, warm and red over the cheekbones, with something ardent and faded about them such as one sees in girls from the slums. At such moments, almost as quickly as her personality, her voice changed also, she forsook her own voice to adopt another, raucous, bold, almost dissolute. Night began to fall. What a pleasure to feel her leaning against me, with her toque and her veil, reminding me that it is always thus, seated side by side, that we meet couples who are in love. I was perhaps in love with Albertine, but as I did not venture to let her see my love, although it existed in me, it could only be like an abstract truth, of no value until one has succeeded in checking it by experiment; as it was, it seemed to me unrealisable and outside the plane of life. As for my jealousy, it urged me to leave Albertine as little as possible, although I knew that it would not be completely cured until I had parted from her for ever. I could even feel it in her presence, but would then take care that the circumstances should not be repeated which had aroused it. Once, for example, on a fine morning, we went to luncheon at Rivebelle. The great glazed doors of the dining-room and of that hall in the form of a corridor in which tea was served stood open revealing the sunlit lawns beyond, of which the huge restaurant seemed to form a part. The waiter with the flushed face and black hair that writhed like flames was flying from end to end of that vast expanse less rapidly than in the past, for he was no longer an assistant but was now in charge of a row of tables; nevertheless, owing to his natural activity, sometimes far off, in the dining-room, at other times nearer, but out of doors, serving visitors who had preferred to feed in the garden, one caught sight of him, now here, now there, like successive statues of a young god running, some in the interior, which for that matter was well lighted, of a mansion bounded by a vista of green grass, others beneath the trees, in the bright radiance of an open air life. For a moment he was close to ourselves. Albertine replied absent mindedly to what I had just said to her. She was gazing at him with rounded eyes. For a minute or two I felt that one may be close to the person whom one loves and yet not have her with one. They had the appearance of being engaged in a mysterious conversation, rendered mute by my presence, and the sequel possibly of meetings in the past of which I knew nothing, or merely of a glance that he had given her \u2014 at which I was the terzo incomodo, from whom the others try to hide things. Even when, forcibly recalled by his employer, he had withdrawn from us, Albertine while continuing her meal seemed to be regarding the restaurant and its gardens merely as a lighted running-track, on which there appeared here and there amid the varied scenery the swift-foot god with the black tresses. At one moment I asked myself whether she was not going to rise up and follow him, leaving me alone at my table. But in the days that followed I began to forget for ever this painful impression, for I had decided never to return to Rivebelle, I had extracted a promise from Albertine, who assured me that she had never been there before and would never return there. And I denied that the nimble-footed waiter had had eyes only for her, so that she should not believe that my company had deprived her of a pleasure. It happened now and again that I would revisit Rivebelle, but alone, and drink too much, as I had done there in the past. As I drained a final glass I gazed at a round pattern painted on the white wall, concentrated upon it the pleasure that I felt. It alone in the world had any existence for me; I pursued it, touched it and lost it by turns with my wavering glance, and felt indifferent to the future, contenting myself with my painted pattern like a butterfly circling about a poised butterfly with which it is going to end its life in an act of supreme consummation. The moment was perhaps particularly well chosen for giving up a woman whom no very recent or very keen suffering obliged me to ask for this balm for a malady which they possess who have caused it. I was calmed by these very drives, which, even if I did not think of them at the moment save as a foretaste of a morrow which itself, notwithstanding the longing with which it filled me, was not to be different from to-day, had the charm of having been torn from the places which Albertine had frequented hitherto and where I had not been with her, her aunt\u2019s house, those of her girl friends. The charm not of a positive joy, but only of the calming of an anxiety, and quite strong nevertheless. For at an interval of a few days, when my thoughts turned to the farm outside which we had sat drinking cider, or simply to the stroll we had taken round Saint-Mars le V\u00eatu, remembering that Albertine had been walking by my side in her toque, the sense of her presence added of a sudden so strong a virtue to the trivial image of the modern church that at the moment when the sunlit front came thus of its own accord to pose before me in memory, it was like a great soothing compress laid upon my heart. I dropped Albertine at Parville, but only to join her again in the evening and lie stretched out by her side, in the darkness, upon the beach. No doubt I did not see her every day, still I could say to myself: \u201cIf she were to give an account of how she spent her time, of her life, it would still be myself that played the largest part in it;\u201d and we spent together long hours on end which brought into my days so sweet an intoxication that even when, at Parville, she jumped from the car which I was to send to fetch her an hour later, I no more felt myself to be alone in it than if before leaving me she had strewn it with flowers. I might have dispensed with seeing her every day; I was going to be happy when I left her, and I knew that the calming effect of that happiness might be prolonged over many days. But at that moment I heard Albertine as she left me say to her aunt or to a girl friend: \u201cThen to-morrow at eight-thirty. We mustn\u2019t be late, the others will be ready at a quarter past.\u201d The conversation of a woman one loves is like the soil that covers a subterranean and dangerous water; one feels at every moment beneath the words the presence, the penetrating chill of an invisible pool; one perceives here and there its treacherous percolation, but the water itself remains hidden. The moment I heard these words of Albertine, my calm was destroyed. I wanted to ask her to let me see her the following morning, so as to prevent her from going to this mysterious rendezvous at half-past eight which had been mentioned in my presence only in covert terms. She would no doubt have begun by obeying me, while regretting that she had to give up her plans; in time she would have discovered my permanent need to upset them; I should have become the person from whom one hides everything. Besides, it is probable that these gatherings from which I was excluded amounted to very little, and that it was perhaps from the fear that I might find one of the other girls there vulgar or boring that I was not invited to them. Unfortunately this life so closely involved with Albertine\u2019s had a reaction not only upon myself; to me it brought calm; to my mother it caused an anxiety, her confession of which destroyed my calm. As I entered the hotel happy in my own mind, determined to terminate, one day soon, an existence the end of which I imagined to depend upon my own volition, my mother said to me, hearing me send a message to the chauffeur to go and fetch Albertine: \u201cHow you do waste your money.\u201d (Fran\u00e7oise in her simple and expressive language said with greater force: \u201cThat\u2019s the way the money goes.\u201d) \u201cTry,\u201d Mamma went on, \u201cnot to become like Charles de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, of whom his mother said: \u2018His hand is a crucible in which money melts.\u2019 Besides, I do really think you have gone about quite enough with Albertine. I assure you, you\u2019re overdoing it, even to her it may seem ridiculous. I was delighted to think that you found her a distraction, I am not asking you never to see her again, but simply that it may not be impossible to meet one of you without the other.\u201d My life with Albertine, a life devoid of keen pleasures \u2014 that is to say of keen pleasures that I could feel \u2014 that life which I intended to change at any moment, choosing a calm interval, became once again suddenly and for a time necessary to me when, by these words of Mamma\u2019s, it found itself threatened. I told my mother that what she had just said would delay for perhaps two months the decision for which she asked, which otherwise I would have reached before the end of that week. Mamma began to laugh (so as not to depress me) at this instantaneous effect of her advice, and promised not to speak of the matter to me again so as not to prevent the rebirth of my good intentions. But since my grandmother\u2019s death, whenever Mamma allowed herself to laugh, the incipient laugh would be cut short and would end in an almost heartbroken expression of sorrow, whether from remorse at having been able for an instant to forget, or else from the recrudescence which this brief moment of oblivion had given to her cruel obsession. But to the thoughts aroused in her by the memory of my grandmother, which was rooted in my mother\u2019s mind, I felt that on this occasion there were added others, relative to myself, to what my mother dreaded as the sequel of my intimacy with Albertine; an intimacy to which she dared not, however, put a stop, in view of what I had just told her. But she did not appear convinced that I was not mistaken. She remembered all the years in which my grandmother and she had refrained from speaking to me of my work, and of a more wholesome rule of life which, I said, the agitation into which their exhortations threw me alone prevented me from beginning, and which, notwithstanding their obedient silence, I had failed to pursue. After dinner the car brought Albertine back; there was still a glimmer of daylight; the air was not so warm, but after a scorching day we both dreamed of strange and delicious coolness; then to our fevered eyes the narrow slip of moon appeared at first (as on the evening when I had gone to the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s and Albertine had telephoned to me) like the slight, fine rind, then like the cool section of a fruit which an invisible knife was beginning to peel in the sky. Sometimes too, it was I that went in search of my mistress, a little later in that case; she would be waiting for me before the arcade of the market at Maineville. At first I could not make her out; I would begin to fear that she might not be coming, that she had misunderstood me. Then I saw her in her white blouse with blue spots spring into the car by my side with the light bound of a young animal rather than a girl. And it was like a dog too that she began to caress me interminably. When night had fallen and, as the manager of the hotel remarked to me, the sky was all \u2018studied\u2019 with stars, if we did not go for a drive in the forest with a bottle of champagne, then, without heeding the strangers who were still strolling upon the faintly lighted front, but who could not have seen anything a yard away on the dark sand, we would lie down in the shelter of the dunes; that same body in whose suppleness abode all the feminine, marine and sportive grace of the girls whom I had seen for the first time pass before a horizon of waves, I held pressed against my own, beneath the same rug, by the edge of the motionless sea divided by a tremulous path of light; and we listened to the sea without tiring and with the same pleasure, both when it held its breath, suspended for so long that one thought the reflux would never come, and when at last it gasped out at our feet the long awaited murmur. Finally I took Albertine back to Parville. When we reached her house, we were obliged to break off our kisses for fear lest some one should see us; not wishing to go to bed she returned with me to Balbec, from where I took her back for the last time to Parville; the chauffeurs of those early days of the motor-car were people who went to bed at all hours. And as a matter of fact I returned to Balbec only with the first dews of morning, alone this time, but still surrounded with the presence of my mistress, gorged with an inexhaustible provision of kisses. On my table I would find a telegram or a postcard. Albertine again! She had written them at Quetteholme when I had gone off by myself in the car, to tell me that she was thinking of me. I got into bed as I read them over. Then I caught sight, over the curtains, of the bright streak of daylight and said to myself that we must be in love with one another after all, since we had spent the night in one another\u2019s arms. When next morning I caught sight of Albertine on the front, I was so afraid of her telling me that she was not free that day, and could not accede to my request that we should go out together, that I delayed as long as possible making the request. I was all the more uneasy since she wore a cold, preoccupied air; people were passing whom she knew; doubtless she had made plans for the afternoon from which I was excluded. I looked at her, I looked at that charming body, that blushing head of Albertine, rearing in front of me the enigma of her intentions, the unknown decision which was to create the happiness or misery of my afternoon. It was a whole state of the soul, a whole future existence that had assumed before my eyes the allegorical and fatal form of a girl. And when at last I made up my mind, when with the most indifferent air that I could muster, I asked: \u201cAre we to go out together now, and again this evening?\u201d and she replied: \u201cWith the greatest pleasure,\u201d then the sudden replacement, in the rosy face, of my long uneasiness by a-delicious sense of ease made even more precious to me those outlines to which I was perpetually indebted for the comfort, the relief that we feel after a storm has broken. I repeated to myself: \u201cHow sweet she is, what an adorable creature!\u201d in an excitement less fertile than that caused by intoxication, scarcely more profound than that of friendship, but far superior to the excitement of social life. We cancelled our order for the car only on the days when there was a dinner-party at the Verdurins\u2019 and on those when, Albertine not being free to go out with me, I took the opportunity to inform anybody who wished to see me that I should be remaining at Balbec. I gave Saint-Loup permission to come on these days, but on these days only. For on one occasion when he had arrived unexpectedly, I had preferred to forego the pleasure of seeing Albertine rather than run the risk of his meeting her, than endanger the state of happy calm in which I had been dwelling for some time and see my jealousy revive. And I had been at my ease only after Saint-Loup had gone. And so he pledged himself, with regret, but with scrupulous observance, never to come to Balbec unless summoned there by myself. In the past, when I thought with longing of the hours that Mme. de Guermantes passed in his company, how I valued the privilege of seeing him! Other people never cease to change places in relation to ourselves. In the imperceptible but eternal march of the world, we regard them as motionless in a moment of vision, too short for us to perceive the motion that is sweeping them on. But we have only to select in our memory two pictures taken of them at different moments, close enough together however for them not to have altered in themselves \u2014 perceptibly, that is to say \u2014 and the difference between the two pictures is a measure of the displacement that they have undergone in relation to us. He alarmed me dreadfully by talking to me of the Verdurins, I was afraid that he might ask me to take him there, which would have been quite enough, what with the jealousy that I should be feeling all the time, to spoil all the pleasure that I found in going there with Albertine. But fortunately Robert assured me that, on the contrary, the one thing he desired above all others was not to know them. \u201cNo,\u201d he said to me, \u201cI find that sort of clerical atmosphere maddening.\u201d I did not at first understand the application of the adjective clerical to the Verdurins, but the end of Saint-Loup\u2019s speech threw a light on his meaning, his concessions to those fashions in words which one is often astonished to see adopted by intelligent men. \u201cI mean the houses,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere people form a tribe, a religious order, a chapel. You aren\u2019t going to tell me that they\u2019re not a little sect; they\u2019re all butter and honey to the people who belong, no words bad enough for those who don\u2019t. The question is not, as for Hamlet, to be or not to be, but to belong or not to belong. You belong, my uncle Charlus belongs. I can\u2019t help it, I never have gone in for that sort of thing, it isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I need hardly say that the rule which I had imposed upon Saint-Loup, never to come and see me unless I had expressly invited him, I promulgated no less strictly for all and sundry of the persons with whom I had gradually begun to associate at la Raspeli\u00e8re, F\u00e9terne, Montsurvent, and elsewhere; and when I saw from the hotel the smoke of the three o\u2019clock train which in the anfractuosity of the cliffs of Parville left its stable plume which long remained hanging from the flank of the green slopes, I had no hesitation as to the identity of the visitor who was coming to tea with me and was still, like a classical deity, concealed from me by that little cloud. I am obliged to confess that this visitor, authorised by me beforehand to come, was hardly ever Saniette, and I have often reproached myself for this omission. But Saniette\u2019s own consciousness of his being a bore (far more so, naturally, when he came to pay a call than when he told a story) had the effect that, albeit he was more learned, more intelligent and a better man all round than most people, it seemed impossible to feel in his company, I do not say any pleasure, but anything save an almost intolerable irritation which spoiled one\u2019s whole afternoon. Probably if Saniette had frankly admitted this boredom which he was afraid of causing, one would not have dreaded his visits. Boredom is one of the least of the evils that we have to endure, his boringness existed perhaps only in the imagination of other people, or had been inoculated into him by them by some process of suggestion which had taken root in his charming modesty. But he was so anxious not to let it be seen that he was not sought after, that he dared not offer himself. Certainly he was right in not behaving like the people who are so glad to be able to raise their hats in a public place, that when, not having seen you for years, they catch sight of you in a box with smart people whom they do not know, they give you a furtive but resounding good-evening, seeking an excuse in the pleasure, the emotion that they felt on seeing you, on learning that you are going about again, that you are looking well, etc. Saniette, on the contrary, was lacking in courage. He might, at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s or in the little tram, have told me that it would give him great pleasure to come and see me at Balbec, were he not afraid of disturbing me. Such a suggestion would not have alarmed me. On the contrary, he offered nothing, but with a tortured expression on his face and a stare as indestructible as a fired enamel, into the composition of which, however, there entered, with a passionate desire to see one \u2014 provided he did not find some one else who was more entertaining \u2014 the determination not to let this desire be manifest, said to me with a detached air: \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to know what you will be doing in the next few days, because I shall probably be somewhere in the neighbourhood of Balbec? Not that it makes the slightest difference, I just thought I would ask you.\u201d This air deceived nobody, and the inverse signs whereby we express our sentiments by their opposites are so clearly legible that we ask ourselves how thete can still be people who say, for instance: \u201cI have so many invitations that I don\u2019t know where to lay my head\u201d to conceal the fact that they have been invited nowhere. But what was more, this detached air, probably on account of the heterogeneous elements that had gone to form it, gave you, what you would never have felt in the fear of boredom or in a frank admission of the desire to see you, that is to say that sort of distaste, of repulsion, which in the category of relations of simple social courtesy corresponds to \u2014 in that of love \u2014 the disguised offer made to a lady by the lover whom she does not love to see her on the following day, he protesting the while that it does not really matter, or indeed not that offer but an attitude of false coldness. There emanated at once from San-iette\u2019s person something or other which made you answer him in the ten-derest of tones: \u201cNo, unfortunately, this week, I must explain to you. . . . \u201d And I allowed to call upon me instead people who were a long way his inferiors but had not his gaze charged with melancholy or his mouth wrinkled with all the bitterness of all the calls which he longed, while saying nothing about them, to pay upon this person and that. Unfortunately it was very rarely that Saniette did not meet in the \u2018crawler\u2019 the guest who was coming to see me, if indeed the latter had not said to me at the Verdurins\u2019: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I\u2019m coming to see you on Thursday,\u201d the very day on which I had just told Saniette that I should not be at home. So that he came in the end to imagine life as filled with entertainments arranged behind his back, if not actually at his expense. On the other hand, as none of us is ever a single person, this too discreet of men was morbidly indiscreet. On the one occasion on which he happened to come and see me uninvited, a letter, I forget from whom, had been left lying on my table. After the first few minutes, I saw that he was paying only the vaguest attention to what I was saying. The letter, of whose subject he knew absolutely nothing, fascinated him and at every moment I expected his glittering eyeballs to detach themselves from their sockets and fly to the letter which, of no importance in itself, his curiosity had made magnetic. You would have called him a bird about to dash into the jaws of a serpent. Finally he could restrain himself no longer, he began by altering its position, as though he were trying to tidy my room. This not sufficing him, he took it up, turned it over, turned it back again, as though mechanically. Another form of his indiscretion was that once he had fastened himself to you he could not tear himself away. As I was feeling unwell that day, I asked him to go back by the next train, in half-an-hour\u2019s time. He did not doubt that I was feeling unwell, but replied: \u201cI shall stay for an hour and a quarter, and then I shall go.\u201d Since then I have regretted that I did not tell him, whenever I had an opportunity, to come and see me. Who knows? Possibly I might have charmed away his ill fortune, other people would have invited him for whom he would immediately have deserted myself, so that my invitations would have had the twofold advantage of giving him pleasure and ridding me of his company\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the days following those on which I had been \u2018at home,\u2019 I naturally did not expect any visitors and the motor-car would come to fetch us, Albertine and myself. And, when we returned, Aim\u00e9, on the lowest step of the hotel, could not help looking, with passionate, curious, greedy eyes, to see what tip I was giving the chauffeur. It was no use my enclosing my coin or note in my clenched fist, Aim\u00e9\u2018s gaze tore my fingers apart. He turned his head away a moment later, for he was discreet, well bred, and indeed was himself content with relatively small wages. But the money that another person received aroused in him an irrepressible curiosity and made his mouth water. During these brief moments, he wore the attentive, feverish air of a boy reading one of Jules Verne\u2019s tales, or of a diner seated at a neighbouring table in a restaurant who, seeing the waiter carving for you a pheasant which he himself either could not afford or would not order, abandons for an instant his serious thoughts to fasten upon the bird a gaze which love and longing cause to smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, day after day, these excursions in the motor-car followed one another. But once, as I was being taken up to my room, the lift-boy said to me: \u201cThat gentleman has been, he gave me a message for you.\u201d The lift-boy uttered these words in an almost inaudible voice, coughing and expectorating in my face. \u201cI haven\u2019t half caught cold!\u201d he went on, as though I were incapable of perceiving this for myself. \u201cThe doctor says it\u2019s whooping-cough,\u201d and he began once more to cough and expectorate over me. \u201cDon\u2019t tire yourself by trying to speak,\u201d I said to him with an air of kindly interest, which was feigned. I was afraid of catching the whooping-cough which, with my tendency to choking fits, would have been a serious matter to me. But he made a point of honour, like a virtuoso who refuses to let himself be taken to hospital, of talking and expectorating all the time. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said (\u201cPerhaps not to you,\u201d I thought, \u201cbut to me it does\u201d). \u201cBesides, I shall be returning soon to Paris.\u201d (\u201cExcellent, provided he doesn\u2019t give it to me first.\u201d) \u201cIt seems,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat Paris is quite superb. It must be even more superb than here or Monte-Carlo, although pages, in fact visitors, and even head waiters who have been to Monte-Carlo for the season have often told me that Paris was not so superb as Monte-Carlo. They were cheated, perhaps, and yet, to be a head waiter, you\u2019ve got to have your wits about you; to take all the orders, reserve tables, you need a head! I\u2019ve heard it said that it\u2019s even more terrible than writing plays and books.\u201d We had almost reached my landing when the lift-boy carried me down again to the ground floor because he found that the button was not working properly, and in a moment had put it right. I told him that I preferred to walk upstairs, by which I meant, without putting it in so many words, that I preferred not to catch whooping-cough. But with a cordial and contagious burst of coughing the boy thrust me back into the lift. \u201cThere\u2019s no danger now, I\u2019ve fixed the button.\u201d Seeing that he was not ceasing to talk, preferring to learn the name of my visitor and the message that he had left, rather than the comparative beauties of Balbec, Paris and Monte-Carlo, I said to him (as one might say to a tenor who is wearying one with Benjamin Godard, \u201cWon\u2019t you sing me some Debussy?\u201d) \u201cBut who is the person that called to see me?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the gentleman you went out with yesterday. I am going to fetch his card, it\u2019s with my porter.\u201d As, the day before, I had dropped Robert de Saint-Loup at Donci\u00e8res station before going to meet Albertine, I supposed that the lift-boy was referring to him, but it was the chauffeur. And by describing him in the words: \u201cThe gentleman you went out with,\u201d he taught me at the same time that a working man is just as much a gentleman as a man about town. A lesson in the use of words only. For in point of fact I had never made any distinction between the classes. And if I had felt, on hearing a chauffeur called a gentleman, the same astonishment as Comte X who had only held that rank for a week and whom, by saying: \u201cthe Comtesse looks tired,\u201d I made turn his head round to see who it was that I meant, it was simply because I was not familiar with that use of the word; I had never made any difference between working men, professional men and noblemen, and I should have been equally ready to make any of them my friends. With a certain preference for the working men, and after them for the noblemen, not because I liked them better, but because I knew that one could expect greater courtesy from them towards the working men than one finds among professional men, whether because the great nobleman does not despise the working man as the professional man does or else because they are naturally polite to anybody, as beautiful women are glad to bestow a smile which they know to be so joyfully received. I cannot however pretend that this habit that I had of putting people of humble station on a level with people in society, even if it was quite understood by the latter, was always entirely satisfactory to my mother. Not that, humanly speaking, she made any difference between one person and another, and if Fran\u00e7oise was ever in sorrow or in pain she was comforted and tended by Mamma with the same devotion as her best friend. But my mother was too much my grandmother\u2019s daughter not to accept, in social matters, the rule of caste. People at Combray might have kind hearts, sensitive natures, might have adopted the most perfect theories of human equality, my mother, when a footman became emancipated, began to say \u2018you\u2019 and slipped out of the habit of addressing me in the third person, was moved by these presumptions to the same wrath that breaks out in Saint-Simon\u2019s Memoirs, whenever a nobleman who is not entitled to it seizes a pretext for assuming the style of \u2018Highness\u2019 in an official document, or for not paying dukes the deference he owes to them and is gradually beginning to lay aside. There was a \u2018Combray spirit\u2019 so refractory that it will require centuries of good nature (my mother\u2019s was boundless), of theories of equality, to succeed in dissolving it. I cannot swear that in my mother certain particles of this spirit had not remained insoluble. She would have been as reluctant to give her hand to a footman as she would have been ready to give him ten francs (which for that matter he was far more glad to receive). To her, whether she admitted it or not, masters were masters, and servants were the people who fed in the kitchen. When she saw the driver of a motor-car dining with me in the restaurant, she was not altogether pleased, and said to me: \u201cIt seems to me you might have a more suitable friend than a mechanic,\u201d as she might have said, had it been a question of my marriage: \u201cYou might find somebody better than that.\u201d This particular chauffeur (fortunately I never dreamed of inviting him to dinner) had come to tell me that the motor-car company which had sent him to Balbec for the season had ordered him to return to Paris on the following day. This excuse, especially as the chauffeur was charming and expressed himself so simply that one would always have taken anything he said for Gospel, seemed to us to be most probably true. It was only half so. There was as a matter of fact no more work for him at Balbec. And in any case, the Company being only half convinced of the veracity of the young Evangelist, bowed over the consecration cross of his steering-wheel, was anxious that he should return as soon as possible to Paris. And indeed if the young Apostle wrought a miracle in multiplying his mileage when he was calculating it for M. de Charlus, when on the other hand it was a matter of rendering his account to the Company, he divided what he had earned by six. In consequence of which the Company, coming to the conclusion either that nobody wanted a car now at Balbec, which, so late in the season, was quite probable, or that it was being robbed, decided that, upon either hypothesis, the best thing was to recall him to Paris, not that there was very much work for him there. What the chauffeur wished was to avoid, if possible, the dead season. I have said \u2014 though I was unaware of this at the time, when the knowledge of it would have saved me much annoyance \u2014 that he was on intimate terms (without their ever shewing any sign of acquaintance before other people) with Morel. Starting from the day on which he was ordered back, before he realised that there was still a way out of going, we were obliged to content ourselves for our excursions with hiring a carriage, or sometimes, as an amusement for Albertine and because she was fond of riding, a pair of saddle-horses. The carriages were unsatisfactory. \u201cWhat a rattle-trap,\u201d Albertine would say. I would often, as it happened, have preferred to be driving by myself. Without being ready to fix a date, I longed to put an end to this existence which I blamed for making me renounce not so much work as pleasure. It would happen also, however, that the habits which bound me were suddenly abolished, generally when some former self, full of the desire to live a merry life, took the place of what was my self at the moment. I felt this longing to escape especially strong one day when, having left Albertine at her aunt\u2019s, I had gone on horseback to call on the Verdurins and had taken an unfrequented path through the woods the beauty of which they had extolled to me. Clinging to the outline of the cliffs, it alternately climbed and then, hemmed in by dense woods on either side, dived into savage gorges. For a moment the barren rocks by which I was surrounded, the sea visible in their jagged intervals, swam before my eyes, like fragments of another universe: I had recognised the mountainous and marine landscape which Elstir had made the scene of those two admirable water colours: \u2018Poet meeting a Muse,\u2019 \u2018Young Man meeting a Centaur\u2019 which I had seen at the Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019s. The thought of them transported the place in which I was so far beyond the world of to-day that I should not have been surprised if, like the young man of the prehistoric age that Elstir painted, I had in the course of my ride come upon a mythological personage. Suddenly, my horse gave a start; he had heard a strange sound; it was all I could do to hold him and remain in the saddle, then I raised in the direction from which the sound seemed to come my eyes filled with tears and saw, not two hundred feet above my head, against the sun, between two great wings of flashing metal which were carrying him on, a creature whose barely visible face appeared to me to resemble that of a man. I was as deeply moved as a Greek upon seeing for the first time a demigod. I cried also, for I was ready to cry the moment I realised that the sound came from above my head \u2014 aeroplanes were still rare in those days \u2014 at the thought that what I was going to see for the first time was an aeroplane. Then, just as when in a newspaper one feels that one is coming to a moving passage, the mere sight of the machine was enough to make me burst into tears. Meanwhile the airman seemed to be uncertain of his course; I felt that there lay open before him \u2014 before me, had not habit made me a prisoner \u2014 all the routes in space, in life itself; he flew on, let himself glide for a few moments, over the sea, then quickly making up his mind, seeming to yield to some attraction the reverse of gravity, as though returning to his native element, with a slight movement of his golden wings, rose sheer into the sky\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To come back to the mechanic, he demanded of Morel that the Verdurins should not merely replace their break by a motor-car (which, granted their generosity towards the faithful, was comparatively easy), but, what was less easy, replace their head coachman, the sensitive young man who was inclined to dark thoughts, by himself, the chauffeur. This change was carried out in a few days by the following device. Morel had begun by seeing that the coachman was robbed of everything that he needed for the carriage. One day it was the bit that was missing, another day the curb. At other times it was the cushion of his box-seat that had vanished, or his whip, his rug, his hammer, sponge, chamois-leather. But he always managed to borrow what he required from a neighbour; only he was late in bringing round the carriage, which put him in M. Verdurin\u2019s bad books and plunged him in a state of melancholy and dark thoughts. The chauffeur, who was in a hurry to take his place, told Morel that he would have to return to Paris. It was time to do something desperate. Morel persuaded M. Verdurin\u2019s servants that the young coachman had declared that he would set a trap for the lot of them, boasting that he could take on all six of them at once, and assured them that they could not overlook such an insult. He himself could not take any part in the quarrel, but he warned them so that they might be on their guard. It was arranged that while M. and Mme. Verdurin and their guests were out walking the servants should fall upon the young man in the coach house. I may mention, although it was only the pretext for what was bound to happen, but because the people concerned interested me later on, that the Verdurins had a friend staying with them that day whom they had promised to take for a walk before his departure, which was fixed for that same evening\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What surprised me greatly when we started off for our walk was that Morel, who was coming with us, and was to play his violin under the trees, said to me: \u201cListen, I have a sore arm, I don\u2019t want to say anything about it to Mme. Verdurin, but you might ask her to send for one of her footmen, Howsler for instance, he can carry my things.\u201d \u201cI think you ought to suggest some one else,\u201d I replied. \u201cHe will be wanted here for dinner.\u201d A look of anger passed over Morel\u2019s face. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to trust my violin to any Tom, Dick or Harry.\u201d I realised later on his reason for this selection. Howsler was the beloved brother of the young coachman, and, if he had been left at home, might have gone to his rescue. During our walk, dropping his voice so that the elder Howsler should not overhear: \u201cWhat a good fellow he is,\u201d said Morel. \u201cSo is his brother, for that matter. If he hadn\u2019t that fatal habit of drinking. . . . \u201d \u201cDid you say drinking?\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, turning pale at the idea of having a coachman who drank. \u201cYou\u2019ve never noticed it. I always say to myself it\u2019s a miracle that he\u2019s never had an accident while he\u2019s been driving you.\u201d \u201cDoes he drive anyone else, then?\u201d \u201cYou can easily see how many spills he\u2019s had, his face to-day is a mass of bruises. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s escaped being killed, he\u2019s broken his shafts.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him to-day,\u201d said Mme.\u2019 Verdurin, trembling at the thought of what might have happened to her, \u201cyou appal me.\u201d She tried to cut short the walk so as to return at once, but Morel chose an aria by Bach with endless variations to keep her away from the house. As soon as we got back she went to the stable, saw the new shaft and Howsler streaming with blood. She was on the point of telling him, without making any comment on what she had seen, that she did not require a coachman any longer, and of paying him his wages, but of his own accord, not wishing to accuse his fellow-servants, to whose animosity he attributed retrospectively the theft of all his saddlery, and seeing that further patience would only end in his being left for dead on the ground, he asked leave to go at once, which made everything quite simple. The chauffeur began his duties next day and, later on, Mme. Verdurin (who had been obliged to engage another) was so well satisfied with him that she recommended him to me warmly, as a man on whom I might rely. I, knowing nothing of all this, used to engage him by the day in Paris, but I am anticipating events, I shall come to all this when I reach the story of Albertine. At the present moment we are at la Raspeli\u00e8re, where I have just been dining for the first time with my mistress, and M. de Charlus with Morel, the reputed son of an \u2018Agent\u2019 who drew a fixed salary of thirty thousand francs annually, kept his carriage, and had any number of major-domos, subordinates, gardeners, bailiffs and farmers at his beck and call. But, since I have so far anticipated, I do not wish to leave the reader under the impression that Morel was entirely wicked. He was, rather, a mass of contradictions, capable on certain days of being genuinely kind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was naturally greatly surprised to hear that the coachman had been dismissed, and even more surprised when I recognised his successor as the chauffeur who had been taking Albertine and myself in his car. But he poured out a complicated story, according to which he had thought that he was summoned back to Paris, where an order had come for him to go to the Verdurins, and I did not doubt his word for an instant. The coachman\u2019s dismissal was the cause of Morel\u2019s talking to me for a few minutes, to express his regret at the departure of that worthy fellow. However, even apart from the moments when I was alone, and he literally bounded towards me beaming with joy, Morel, seeing that everybody made much of me at la Raspeli\u00e8re and feeling that he was deliberately cutting himself off from the society of a person who could in no way imperil him, since he had made me burn my boats and had destroyed all possibility of my treating him with an air of patronage (which I had never, for that matter, dreamed of adopting), ceased to hold aloof from me. I attributed his change of attitude to the influence of M. de Charlus, which as a matter of fact did make him in certain respects less limited, more of an artist, but in others, when he interpreted literally the eloquent, insincere, and moreover transient formulas of his master, made him stupider than ever. That M. de Charlus might have said something to him was as a matter of fact the only thing that occurred to me. How was I to have guessed then what I was told afterwards (and have never been certain of its truth, Andr\u00e9e\u2019s assertions as to everything that concerned Albertine, especially later on, having always seemed to me to be statements to be received with caution, for, as we have already seen, she was not genuinely fond of my mistress and was jealous of her), a thing which in any event, even if it was true, was remarkably well concealed from me by both of them: that Albertine was on the best of terms with Morel? The novel attitude which, about the time of the coachman\u2019s dismissal, Morel adopted with regard to myself, enabled me to change my opinion of him. I retained the ugly impression of his character which had been suggested by the servility which this young man had shewn me when he needed my services, followed, as soon as the service had been rendered, by a scornful aloofness as though he did not even see me. I still lacked evidence of his venal relations with M. de Charlus, and also of his bestial and purposeless instincts, the non-gratification of which (when it occurred) or the complications that they involved, were the cause of his sorrows; but his character was not so uniformly vile and was full of contradictions. He resembled an old book of the middle ages, full of mistakes, of absurd traditions, of obscenities; he was extraordinarily composite. I had supposed at first that his art, in which he was really a past-master, had given him superiorities that went beyond the virtuosity of the mere performer. Once when I spoke of my wish to start work: \u201cWork, become famous,\u201d he said to me. \u201cWho said that?\u201d I inquired. \u201cFontanes, to Chateaubriand.\u201d He also knew certain love letters of Napoleon. Good, I thought to myself, he reads. But this phrase which he had read I know not where was doubtless the only one that he knew in the whole of ancient or modern literature, for he repeated it to me every evening. Another which he quoted even more frequently to prevent me from breathing a word about him to anybody was the following, which he considered equally literary, whereas it is barely grammatical, or at any rate makes no kind of sense, except perhaps to a mystery-loving servant: \u201cBeware of the wary.\u201d As a matter of fact, if one cast back from this stupid maxim to what Fontanes had said to Chateaubriand, one explored a whole side, varied but less contradictory than one might suppose, of Morel\u2019s character. This youth who, provided there was money to be made by it, would have done anything in the world, and without remorse \u2014 perhaps not without an odd sort of vexation, amounting to nervous excitement, to which however the name remorse could not for a moment be applied \u2014 who would, had it been to his advantage, have plunged in distress, not to say mourning, whole families, this youth who set money above everything, above, not to speak of unselfish kindness, the most natural sentiments of common humanity, this same youth nevertheless set above money his certificate as first-prize winner at the Conservatoire and the risk of there being anything said to his discredit in the flute or counterpoint class. And so his most violent rages, his most sombre and unjustifiable fits of ill-temper arose from what he himself (generalising doubtless from certain particular cases in which he had met with spiteful people) called universal treachery. He flattered himself that he escaped from this fault by never speaking about anyone, by concealing his tactics, by distrusting everybody. (Alas for me, in view of what was to happen after my return to Paris, his distrust had not \u2018held\u2019 in the case of the Balbec chauffeur, in whom he had doubtless recognised a peer, that is to say, in contradiction of his maxim, a wary person in the good sense of the word, a wary person who remains obstinately silent before honest folk and at once comes to an understanding with a blackguard.) It seemed to him \u2014 and he was not absolutely wrong \u2014 that his distrust would enable him always to save his bacon, to slip unscathed out of the most perilous adventures, without anyone\u2019s being able not indeed to prove but even to suggest anything against him, in the institution in the Rue Berg\u00e8re. He would work, become famous, would perhaps be one day, with his respectability still intact, examiner in the violin on the Board of that great and glorious Conservatoire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But it is perhaps crediting Morel\u2019s brain with too much logic to attempt to discriminate between these contradictions. As a matter of fact his nature was just like a sheet of paper that has been folded so often in every direction that it is impossible to straighten it out. He seemed to act upon quite lofty principles, and in a magnificent hand, marred by the most elementary mistakes in spelling, spent hours writing to his brother that he had behaved badly to his sisters, that he was their elder, their natural support, etc., and to his sisters that they had shewn a want of respect for himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently, as summer came to an end, when one got out of the train at Douville, the sun dimmed by the prevailing mist had ceased to be anything more in a sky that was uniformly mauve than a lump of redness. To the great peace which descends at nightfall over these tufted salt-marshes, and had tempted a number of Parisians, painters mostly, to spend their holidays at Douville, was added a moisture which made them seek shelter early in their little bungalows. In several of these the lamp was already lighted. Only a few cows remained out of doors gazing at the sea and lowing, while others, more interested in humanity, turned their attention towards our carriages. A single painter who had set up his easel where the ground rose slightly was striving to render that great calm, that hushed luminosity. Perhaps the cattle were going to serve him unconsciously and kindly as models, for their contemplative air and their solitary presence when the human beings had withdrawn, contributed in their own way to enhance the strong impression of repose that evening conveys. And, a few weeks later, the transposition was no less agreeable when, as autumn advanced, the days became really short, and we were obliged to make our journey m the dark. If I had been out anywhere in the afternoon, I had to go back to change my clothes, at the latest, by five o\u2019clock, when at this season the round, red sun had already sunk half way down the slanting sheet of glass, which formerly I had detested, and, like a Greek fire, was inflaming the sea in the glass fronts of all my bookcases. Some wizard\u2019s gesture having revived, as I put on my dinner-jacket, the alert and frivolous self that was mine when I used to go with Saint-Loup to dine at Rivebelle and on the evening when I looked forward to taking Mme. de Stermaria to dine on the island in the Bois, I began unconsciously to hum the same tune that I had hummed then; and it was only when I realised this that by the song I recognised the resurrected singer, who indeed knew no other tune. The first time that I sang it, I was beginning to be in love with Albertine, but I imagined that I would never get to know her. Later on, in Paris, it was when I had ceased to be in love with her and some days after I had enjoyed her for the first time. Now it was when I was in love with her again and on the point of going out to dinner with her, to the great regret of the manager who supposed that I would end by staying at la Raspeli\u00e8re altogether and deserting his hotel, and assured me that he had heard that fever was prevalent in that neighbourhood, due to the marshes of the Bac and their \u2018stagnous\u2019 water. I was delighted by the multiplicity in which I saw my life thus spread over three planes; and besides, when one becomes for an instant one\u2019s former self, that is to say different from what one has been for some time past, one\u2019s sensibility, being no longer dulled by habit, receives the slightest shocks of those vivid impressions which make everything that has preceded them fade into insignificance, and to which, because of their intensity, we attach ourselves with the momentary enthusiasm of a drunken man. It was already night when we got into the omnibus or carriage which was to take us to the station where we would find the little train. And in the hall the chief magistrate was saying to us: \u201cAh! You are going to la Raspeli\u00e8re! Sapristi, she has a nerve, your Mme. Verdurin, to make you travel an hour by train in the dark, simply to dine with her. And then to start off again at ten o\u2019clock at night, with a wind blowing like the very devil. It is easy to see that you have nothing else to do,\u201d he added, rubbing his hands together. No doubt he spoke thus from annoyance at not having been invited, and also from the satisfaction that people feel who are \u2018busy\u2019\u2014 though it be with the most idiotic occupation \u2014 at \u2018not having time\u2019 to do what you are doing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly it is only right that the man who draws up reports, adds up figures, answers business letters, follows the movements of the stock exchange, should feel when he says to you with a sneer: \u201cIt\u2019s all very well for you; you have nothing better to do,\u201d an agreeable sense of his own superiority. But this would be no less contemptuous, would be even more so (for dining out is a thing that the busy man does also) were your recreation writing Hamlet or merely reading it. Wherein busy men shew a want of reflexion. For the disinterested culture which seems to them a comic pastime of idle people at the moment when they find them engaged in it is, they ought to remember, the same that in their own profession brings to the fore men who may not be better magistrates or administrators than themselves but before whose rapid advancement they bow their heads, saying: \u201cIt appears he\u2019s a great reader, a most distinguished individual.\u201d But above all the chief magistrate did not take into account that what pleased me about these dinners at la Raspeli\u00e8re was that, as he himself said quite rightly, though as a criticism, they \u2018meant a regular journey,\u2019 a journey whose charm appeared to me all the more thrilling in that it was not an object in itself, and no one made any attempt to find pleasure in it \u2014 that being reserved for the party for which we were bound, and greatly modified by all the atmosphere that surrounded it. It was already night now when I exchanged the warmth of the hotel \u2014 the hotel that had become my home \u2014 for the railway carriage into which I climbed with Albertine, in which a glimmer of lamplight on the window shewed, at certain halts of the panting little train, that we had arrived at a station. So that there should be no risk of Cottard\u2019s missing us, and not having heard the name of the station, I opened the door, but what burst headlong into the carriage was not any of the faithful, but the wind, the rain, the cold. In the darkness I could make out fields, I could hear the sea, we were in the open country. Albertine, before we were engulfed in the little nucleus, examined herself in a little mirror, extracted from a gold bag which she carried about with her. The fact was that on our first visit, Mme. Verdurin having taken her upstairs to her dressing-room so that she might make herself tidy before dinner, I had felt, amid the profound calm in which I had been living for some time, a slight stir of uneasiness and jealousy at being obliged to part from Albertine at the foot of the stair, and had become so anxious while I was by myself in the drawing-room, among the little clan, and asking myself what my mistress could be doing, that I had sent a telegram the next day, after finding out from M. de Charlus what the correct thing was at the moment, to order from Cartier\u2019s a bag which was the joy of Alber-tine\u2019s life and also of mine. It was for me a guarantee of peace of mind, and also of my mistress\u2019s solicitude. For she had evidently seen that I did not like her to be parted from me at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s and arranged to make in the train all the toilet that was necessary before dinner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Included in the number of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s regular frequenters, and reckoned the most faithful of them all, had been, for some months now, M. de Charlus. Regularly, thrice weekly, the passengers who were sitting in the waiting-rooms or standing upon the platform at Donci\u00e8res-Ouest used to see that stout gentleman go past with his grey hair, his black moustaches, his lips reddened with a salve less noticeable at the end of the season than in summer when the daylight made it more crude and the heat used to melt it. As he made his way towards the little train, he could not refrain (simply from force of habit, as a connoisseur, since he now had a sentiment which kept him chaste, or at least, for most of the time, faithful) from casting at the labourers, soldiers, young men in tennis flannels, a furtive glance at once inquisitorial and timorous, after which he immediately let his eyelids droop over his half-shut eyes with the unction of an ecclesiastic engaged in telling his beads, with the modesty of a bride vowed to the one love of her life or of a well-brought-up girl. The faithful were all the more convinced that he had not seen them, since he got into a different compartment from theirs (as, often enough, did Princess Sherbatoff also), like a man who does not know whether people will be pleased or not to be seen with him and leaves them the option of coming and joining him if they choose. This option had not been taken, at first, by the Doctor, who had asked us to leave him by himself in his compartment. Making a virtue of his natural hesitation now that he occupied a great position in the medical world, it was with a smile, throwing back his head, looking at Ski over his glasses, that he said, either from malice or in the hope of eliciting the opinion of the \u2018comrades\u2019: \u201cYou can understand that if I was by myself, a bachelor, but for my wife\u2019s sake I ask myself whether I ought to allow him to travel with us after what you have told me,\u201d the Doctor whispered. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019re saying?\u201d asked Mme. Cottard. \u201cNothing, it doesn\u2019t concern you, it\u2019s not meant for ladies to hear,\u201d the Doctor replied with a wink, and with a majestic self-satisfaction which held the balance between the dryly malicious air he adopted before his pupils and patients and the uneasiness that used in the past to accompany his shafts of wit at the Verdurins\u2019, and went on talking in a lowered tone. Mme. Cottard could make out only the words \u2018one of the brotherhood\u2019 and \u2018tapette,\u2019 and as in the Doctor\u2019s vocabulary the former expression denoted the Jewish race and the latter a wagging tongue, Mme. Cottard concluded that M. de Charlus must be a garrulous Israelite. She could not understand why people should keep aloof from the Baron for that reason, felt it her duty as the senior lady of the clan to insist that he should not be left alone, and so we proceeded in a body to M. de Charlus\u2019s compartment, led by Cottard who was still perplexed. From the corner in which he was reading a volume of Balzac, M. de Charlus observed this hesitation; and yet he had not raised his eyes. But just as deaf-mutes detect, from a movement of the air imperceptible to other people, that some one is standing behind them, so he had to warn him of other people\u2019s coldness towards him, a positive hyperaesthesia. This had, as it habitually does in every sphere, developed in M. de Charlus imaginary sufferings. Like those neuropaths who, feeling a slight lowering of the temperature, induce from this that there must be a window open on the floor above, become violently excited and start sneezing, M. de Charlus, if a person appeared preoccupied in his presence, concluded that somebody had repeated to that person a remark that he had made about him. But there was no need even for the other person to have a distracted, or a sombre, or a smiling air, he would invent them. On the other hand, cordiality completely concealed from him the slanders of which he had not heard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having begun by detecting Cottard\u2019s hesitation, if, greatly to the surprise of the faithful who did not suppose that their presence had yet been observed by the reader\u2019s lowered gaze, he held out his hand to them when they were at a convenient distance, he contented himself with a forward inclination of his whole person which he quickly drew back for Cottard, without taking in his own gloved hand the hand which the Doctor had held out to him. \u201cWe felt we simply must come and keep you company, Sir, and not leave you alone like that in your little corner. It is a great pleasure to us,\u201d Mme. Cottard began in a friendly tone to the Baron. \u201cI am greatly honoured,\u201d the Baron intoned, bowing coldly. \u201cI was so pleased to hear that you have definitely chosen this neighbourhood to set up your taber. . . . \u201d She was going to say \u2018tabernacle\u2019 but it occurred to her that the word was Hebraic and discourteous to a Jew who might see an allusion in it. And so she paused for a moment to choose another of the expressions that were familiar to her, that is to say a consecrated expression: \u201cto set up, I should say, your penates.\u201d (It is true that these deities do not appertain to the Christian religion either, but to one which has been dead for so long that it no longer claims any devotees whose feelings one need be afraid of hurting.) \u201cWe, unfortunately, what with term beginning, and the Doctor\u2019s hospital duties, can never choose our domicile for very long in one place.\u201d And glancing at a cardboard box: \u201cYou see too how we poor women are less fortunate than the sterner sex, to go only such a short distance as to our friends the Verdurins\u2019, we are obliged to take a whole heap of impedimenta.\u201d I meanwhile was examining the Baron\u2019s volume of Balzac. It was not a paper-covered copy, picked up on a bookstall, like the volume of Bergotte which he had lent me at our first meeting. It was a book from his own library, and as such bore the device: \u201cI belong to the Baron de Charlus,\u201d for which was substituted at times, to shew the studious tastes of the Guermantes: \u201cIn proeliis non semper,\u201d or yet another motto: \u201cNon sine labore.\u201d But we shall see these presently replaced by others, in an attempt to please Morel. Mme. Cottard, a little later, hit upon a subject which she felt to be of more personal interest to the Baron. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you agree with me, Sir,\u201d she said to him presently, \u201cbut I hold very broad views, and, to my mind, there is a great deal of good in all religions. I am not one of the people who get hydrophobia at the sight of a . . . Protestant.\u201d \u201cI was taught that mine is the true religion,\u201d replied M. de Charlus. \u201cHe\u2019s a fanatic,\u201d thought Mme. Cottard, \u201cSwann, until recently, was more tolerant; it is true that he was a converted one.\u201d Now, so far from this being the case, the Baron was not only a Christian, as we know, but pious with a mediaeval fervour. To him as to the sculptors of the middle ages, the Christian church was, in the living sense of the word, peopled with a swarm of beings, whom he believed to be entirely real, Prophets, Apostles, Anpels, holy personages of every sort, surrounding the Incarnate Word, His Mother and Her Spouse, the Eternal Father, all the Martyrs and Doctors of the Church, as they may be seen carved in high relief, thronging the porches or lining the naves of the cathedrals. Out of all these M. de Charlus had chosen as his patrons and intercessors the Archangels Michael, Gabriel and Raphael, to whom he made frequent appeals that they would convey his prayers to the Eternal Father, about Whose Throne they stand. And so Mme. Cottard\u2019s mistake amused me greatly\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To leave the religious sphere, let us mention that the Doctor, who had come to Paris meagrely equipped with the counsels of a peasant mother, and had then been absorbed in the almost purely materialistic studies to which those who seek to advance in a medical career are obliged to devote themselves for a great many years, had never become cultured, had acquired increasing authority but never any experience, took the word \u2018honoured\u2019 in its literal meaning and was at once flattered by it because he was vain and distressed because he had a kind heart. \u201cThat poor de Charlus,\u201d he said to his wife that evening, \u201cmade me feel sorry for him when he said he was honoured by travelling with us. One feels, poor devil, that he knows nobody, that he has to humble himself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But presently, without any need to be guided by the charitable Mme. Cottard, the faithful had succeeded in overcoming the qualms which they had all more or less felt at first, on finding themselves in the company of M. de Charlus. No doubt in his presence they were incessantly reminded of Ski\u2019s revelations, and conscious of the sexual abnormality embodied in their travelling companion. But this abnormality itself had a sort of attraction for them. It gave for them to the Baron\u2019s conversation, remarkable in itself but in ways which they could scarcely appreciate, a savour which made the most interesting conversation, that of Brichot himself, appear slightly insipid in comparison. From the very outset, moreover, they had been pleased to admit that he was intelligent. \u201cThe genius that is perhaps akin to madness,\u201d the Doctor declaimed, and albeit the Princess, athirst for knowledge, insisted, said not another word, this axiom being all that he knew about genius and seeming to him less supported by proof than our knowledge of typhoid fever and arthritis. And as he had become proud and remained ill-bred: \u201cNo questions, Princess, do not interrogate me, I am at the seaside for a rest. Besides, you would not understand, you know nothing about medicine.\u201d And the Princess held her peace with apologies, deciding that Cottard was a charming man and realising that celebrities were not always approachable. In this initial period, then, they had ended by finding M. de Charlus an agreeable person notwithstanding his vice (or what is generally so named). Now it was, quite unconsciously, because of that vice that they found him more intelligent than the rest. The most simple maxims to which, adroitly provoked by the sculptor or the don, M. de Charlus gave utterance concerning love, jealousy, beauty, in view of the experience, strange, secret, refined and monstrous, upon which he founded them, assumed for the faithful that charm of unfamiliarity with which a psychology analogous to that which our own dramatic literature has always offered us bedecks itself in a Russian or Japanese play performed by native actors. One might still venture, when he was not listening, upon a malicious witticism at his expense. \u201cOh!\u201d whispered the sculptor, seeing a young railwayman with the sweeping eyelashes of a dancing girl at whom M. de Charlus could not help staring, \u201cif the Baron begins making eyes at the conductor, we shall never get there, the train will start going backwards. Just look at the way he\u2019s staring at him, this is not a steam-tram we\u2019re on, it\u2019s a funicular.\u201d But when all was said, if M. de Charlus did not appear, it was almost a disappointment to be travelling only with people who were just like everybody else, and not to have by one\u2019s side this painted, paunchy, tightly-buttoned personage, reminding one of a box of exotic and dubious origin from which escapes the curious odour of fruits the mere thought of tasting which stirs the heart. From this point of view, the faithful of the masculine sex enjoyed a keener satisfaction in the short stage of the journey between Saint-Martin du Ch\u00eane, where M. de Charlus got in, and Donci\u00e8res, the station at which Morel joined the party. For so long as the violinist was not there (and provided the ladies and Albertine, keeping to themselves so as not to disturb our conversation, were out of hearing), M. de Charlus made no attempt to appear to be avoiding certain subjects and did not hesitate to speak of \u2018what it is customary to call degenerate morals.\u2019 Albertine could not hamper him, for she was always with the ladies, like a well-bred girl who does not wish her presence to restrict the freedom of grown-up conversation. And I was quite resigned to not having her by my side, on condition however that she remained in the same carriage. For I, who no longer felt any jealousy and scarcely any love for her, never thought of what she might be doing on the days when I did not see her; on the other hand, when I was there, a mere partition which might at a pinch be concealing a betrayal was intolerable to me, and if she retired with the ladies to the next compartment, a moment later, unable to remain in my seat any longer, at the risk of offending whoever might be talking, Brichot, Cottard or Charlus, to whom I could not explain the reason for my flight, I would rise, leave them without ceremony, and, to make certain that nothing abnormal was going on, walk down the corridor. And, till we came to Donci\u00e8res, M. de Charlus, without any fear of shocking his audience, would speak sometimes in the plainest terms of morals which, he declared, for his own part he did not consider either good or evil. He did this from cunning, to shew his breadth of mind, convinced as he was that his own morals aroused no suspicion in the minds of the faithful. He was well aware that there did exist in the world several persons who were, to use an expression which became habitual with him later on, \u2018in the know\u2019 about himself. But he imagined that these persons were not more than three or four, and that none of them was at that moment upon the coast of Normandy. This illusion may appear surprising in so shrewd, so suspicious a man. Even in the case of those whom he believed to be more or less well informed, he flattered himself that their information was all quite vague, and hoped, by telling them this or that fact about anyone, to clear the person in question from all suspicion on the part of a listener who out of politeness pretended to accept his statements. Indeed, being uncertain as to what I might know or guess about him, he supposed that my opinion, which he imagined to be of far longer standing than it actually was, was quite general, and that it was sufficient for him to deny this or that detail to be believed, whereas on the contrary, if our knowledge of the whole always precedes our knowledge of details, it makes our investigation of the latter infinitely easier and having destroyed his cloak of invisibility no longer allows the pretender to conceal what he wishes to keep secret. Certainly when M. de Charlus, invited to a dinner-party by one of the faithful or of their friends, took the most complicated precautions to introduce among the names of ten people whom he mentioned that of Morel, he never imagined that for the reasons, always different, which he gave for the pleasure or convenience which he would find that evening in being invited to meet him, his hosts, while appearing to believe him implicitly, substituted a single reason, always the same, of which he supposed them to be ignorant, namely that he was in love with him. Similarly, Mme. Verdurin, seeming always entirely to admit the motives, half artistic, half charitable, with which M. de Charlus accounted to her for the interest that he took in Morel, never ceased to thank the Baron with emotion for his kindness \u2014 his touching kindness, she called it \u2014 to the violinist. And how astonished M. de Charlus would have been, if, one day when Morel and he were delayed and had not come by the train, he had heard the Mistress say: \u201cWe\u2019re all here now except the young ladies.\u201d The Baron would have been all the more stupefied in that, going hardly anywhere save to la Raspeli\u00e8re, he played the part there of a family chaplain, like the abb\u00e9 in a stock company, and would sometimes (when Morel had 48 hours\u2019 leave) sleep there for two nights in succession. Mme. Verdurin would then give them communicating rooms and, to put them at their ease, would say: \u201cIf you want to have a little music, don\u2019t worry about us, the walls are as thick as a fortress, you have nobody else on your floor, and my husband sleeps like lead.\u201d On such days M. de Charlus would relieve the Princess of the duty of going to meet strangers at the station, apologise for Mme. Verdurin\u2019s absence on the grounds of a state of health which he described so vividly that the guests entered the drawing-room with solemn faces, and uttered cries of astonishment on finding the Mistress up and doing and wearing what was almost a low dress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For M. de Charlus had for the moment become for Mme. Verdurin the faithfullest of the faithful, a second Princess Sherbatoff. Of his position in society she was not nearly so certain as of that of the Princess, imagining that if the latter cared to see no one outside the little nucleus it was out of contempt for other people and preference for it. As this pretence was precisely the Verdurins\u2019 own, they treating as bores everyone to whose society they were not admitted, it is incredible that the Mistress can have believed the Princess to possess a heart of steel, detesting what was fashionable. But she stuck to her guns, and was convinced that in the case of the great lady also it was in all sincerity and from a love of things intellectual that she avoided the company of bores. The latter were, as it happened, diminishing in numbers from the Verdurins\u2019 point of view. Life by the seaside robbed an introduction of the ulterior consequences which might be feared in Paris. Brilliant men who had come down to Balbec without their wives (which made everything much easier) made overtures to la Raspeli\u00e8re and, from being bores, became too charming. This was the case with the Prince de Guermantes, whom the absence of his Princess would not, however, have decided to go \u2018as a bachelor\u2019 to the Verdurins\u2019, had not the lodestone of Dreyfusism been so powerful as to carry him in one stride up the steep ascent to la Raspeli\u00e8re, unfortunately upon a day when the Mistress was not at home. Mme. Verdurin as it happened was not certain that he and M. de Charlus moved in the same world. The Baron had indeed said that the Duc de Guermantes was his brother, but this was perhaps the untruthful boast of an adventurer. Man of the world as he had shewn himself to be, so friendly, so \u2018faithful\u2019 to the Verdurins, the Mistress still almost hesitated to invite him to meet the Prince de Guermantes. She consulted Ski and Brichot: \u201cThe Baron and the Prince de Guermantes, will they be all right together?\u201d \u201cGood gracious, Madame, as to one of the two I think I can safely say.\u201d \u201cWhat good is that to me?\u201d Mme. Verdurin had retorted crossly. \u201cI asked you whether they would mix well together.\u201d \u201cAh! Madame, that is one of the things that it is hard to tell.\u201d Mme. Verdurin had been impelled by no malice. She was certain of the Baron\u2019s morals, but when she expressed herself in these terms had not been thinking about them for a moment, but had merely wished to know whether she could invite the Prince and M. de Charlus on the same evening, without their clashing. She had no malevolent intention when she employed these ready-made expressions which are popular in artistic \u2018little clans.\u2019 To make the most of M. de Guermantes, she proposed to take him in the afternoon, after her luncheon-party, to a charity entertainment at which sailors from the neighbourhood would give a representation of a ship setting sail. But, not having time to attend to everything, she delegated her duties to the faithfullest of the faithful, the Baron. \u201cYou understand, I don\u2019t want them to hang about like mussels on a rock, they must keep moving, we must see them weighing anchor, or whatever it\u2019s called. Now you are always going down to the harbour at Balbec-Plage, you can easily arrange a dress rehearsal without tiring yourself. You must know far more than I do, M. de Charlus, about getting hold of sailors. But after all, we\u2019re giving ourselves a great deal of trouble for M. de Guermantes. Perhaps he\u2019s only one of those idiots from the Jockey Club. Oh! Heavens, I\u2019m running down the Jockey Club, and I seem to remember that you\u2019re one of them. Eh, Baron, you don\u2019t answer me, are you one of them? You don\u2019t care to come out with us? Look, here is a book that has just come, I think you\u2019ll find it interesting. It is by Roujon. The title is attractive: Life among men.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For my part, I was all the more glad that M. de Charlus often took the place of Princess Sherbatoff, inasmuch as I was thoroughly in her bad books, for a reason that was at once trivial and profound. One day when I was in the little train, paying every attention, as was my habit, to Princess Sherbatoff, I saw Mme. de Villeparisis get in. She had as a matter of fact come down to spend some weeks with the Princesse de Luxembourg, but, chained to the daily necessity of seeing Albertine, I had never replied to the repeated invitations of the Marquise and her royal hostess. I felt remorse at the sight of my grandmother\u2019s friend, and, purely from a sense of duty (without deserting Princess Sherbatoff), sat talking to her for some time. I was, as it happened, entirely unaware that Mme. de Villeparisis knew quite well who my companion was but did not wish to speak to her. At the next station, Mme. de Villeparisis left the carriage, indeed I reproached myself with not having helped her on to the platform; I resumed my seat by the side of the Princess. But one would have thought \u2014 a cataclysm frequent among people whose position is far from stable and who are afraid that one may have heard something to their discredit, and may be looking down upon them \u2014 that the curtain had risen upon a fresh scene. Buried in her Revue des Deux Mondes, Madame Sherbatoff barely moved her lips in reply to my questions and finally told me that I was making her head ache. I had not the faintest idea of the nature of my crime. When I bade the Princess good-bye, the customary smile did not light up her face, her chin drooped in a dry acknowledgment, she did not even offer me her hand, nor did she ever speak to me again. But she must have spoken \u2014 though what she said I cannot tell \u2014 to the Verdurins; for as soon as I asked them whether I ought not to say something polite to Princess Sherbatoff, they replied in chorus: \u201cNo! Nol No! Nothing of the sort! She does not care for polite speeches!\u201d They did not say this to effect a breach between us, but she had succeeded in making them believe that she was unmoved by civilities, that hers was a spirit unassailed by the vanities of this world. One needs to have seen the politician who was reckoned the most single-minded, the most uncompromising, the most unapproachable, so long as he was in office, one must have seen him in the hour of his disgrace, humbly soliciting, with a bright, affectionate smile, the haughty greeting of some unimportant journalist, one must have seen Cottard (whom his new patients regarded as a rod of iron) draw himself erect, one must know out of what disappointments in love, what rebuffs to snobbery were built up the apparent pride, the universally acknowledged anti-snobbery of Princess Sherbatoff, in order to grasp that among the human race the rule \u2014 which admits of exceptions, naturally \u2014 is that the reputedly hard people are weak people whom nobody wants, and that the strong, caring little whether they are wanted or not, have alone that meekness which the common herd mistake for weakness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, I ought not to judge Princess Sherbatoff severely. Her case is so common! One day, at the funeral of a Guermantes, a distinguished man who was standing next to me drew my attention to a slim person with handsome features. \u201cOf all the Guermantes,\u201d my neighbour informed me, \u201cthat is the most astonishing, the most singular. He is the Duke\u2019s brother.\u201d I replied imprudently that he was mistaken, that the gentleman in question, who was in no way related to the Guermantes, was named Journier-Sarlov\u00e8ze. The distinguished man turned his back upon me, and has never even bowed to me since\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A great musician, a member of the Institute, occupying a high official position, who was acquainted with Ski, came to Harambouville, where he had a niece staying, and appeared at one of the Verdurins\u2019 Wednesdays. M. de Charlus was especially polite to him (at Morel\u2019s request), principally in order that on his return to Paris the Academician might enable him to attend various private concerts, rehearsals and so forth, at which the violinist would be playing. The Academician, who was flattered, and was naturally a charming person, promised, and kept his promise. The Baron was deeply touched by all the consideration which this personage (who, for his own part, was exclusively and passionately a lover of women) shewed him, all the facilities that he procured to enable him to see Morel in those official quarters which the profane world may not enter, all the opportunities by which the celebrated artist secured that the young virtuoso might shew himself, might make himself known, by naming him in preference to others of equal talent for auditions which were likely to make a special stir. But M. de Charlus never suspected that he ought to be all the more grateful to the maestro in that the latter, doubly deserving, or, if you prefer it, guilty twice over, was completely aware of the relations between the young violinist and his noble patron. He favoured them, certainly without any sympathy for them, being unable to comprehend any other love than that for the woman who had inspired the whole of his music, but from moral indifference, a professional readiness to oblige, social affability, snobbishness. As for his doubts as to the character of those relations, they were so scanty that, at his first dinner at la Raspeli\u00e8re, he had inquired of Ski, speaking of M. de Charlus and Morel, as he might have spoken of a man and his mistress: \u201cHave they been long together?\u201d But, too much the man of the world to let the parties concerned see what was in his mind, prepared, should any gossip arise among Morel\u2019s fellow-students, to rebuke them, and to reassure Morel by saying to him in a fatherly tone: \u201cOne hears that sort of thing about everybody nowadays,\u201d he did not cease to load the Baron with civilities which the latter thought charming, but quite natural, being incapable of suspecting the eminent maestro of so much vice or of so much virtue. For the things that were said behind M. de Charlus\u2019s back, the expressions used about Morel, nobody was ever base enough to repeat to him. And yet this simple situation is enough to shew that even that thing universally decried, which would find no defender anywhere: the breath of scandal, has itself, whether it be aimed at us and so become especially disagreeable to us, or inform us of something about a third person of which we were unaware, a psychological value of its own. It prevents the mind from falling asleep over the fictitious idea that it has of what it supposes things to be when it is actually no more than their outward appearance. It turns this appearance inside out with the magic dexterity of an idealist philosopher and rapidly presents to our gaze an unsuspected corner of the reverse side of the fabric. How could M. de Charlus have imagined the remark made of him by a certain tender relative: \u201cHow on earth can you suppose that M\u00e9m\u00e9 is in love with me, you forget that I am a woman!\u201d And yet she was genuinely, deeply attached to M. de Charlus. Why then need we be surprised that in the case of the Verdurins, whose affection and goodwill he had no title to expect, the remarks which they made behind his back (and they did not, as we shall see, confine themselves to remarks), were so different from what he imagined them to be, that is to say from a mere repetition of the remarks that he heard when he was present? The latter alone decorated with affectionate inscriptions the little ideal tent to which M. de Charlus retired at times to dream by himself, when he introduced his imagination for a moment into the idea that the Verdurins held of him. Its atmosphere was so congenial, so cordial, the repose it offered so comforting, that when M. de Charlus, before going to sleep, had withdrawn to it for a momentary relief from his worries, he never emerged from it without a smile. But, for each one of us, a tent of this sort has two sides: as well as the side which we suppose to be the only one, there is the other which is normally invisible to us, the true front, symmetrical with the one that we know, but very different, whose decoration, in which we should recognise nothing of what we-expected to see, would horrify us, as being composed of the hateful symbols of an unsuspected hostility. What a shock for M. de Charlus, if he had found his way into one of these enemy tents, by means of some piece of scandal as though by one of those service stairs where obscene drawings are scribbled outside the back doors of flats by unpaid tradesmen or dismissed servants. But, just as we do not possess that sense of direction with which certain birds are endowed, so we lack the sense of our own visibility as we lack that of distances, imagining as quite close to us the interested attention of the people who on the contrary never give us a thought, and not suspecting that we are at the same time the sole preoccupation of others. And so M. de Charlus lived in a state of deception like the fish which thinks that the water in which it is swimming extends beyond the glass wall of its aquarium which mirrors it, while it does not see close beside it in the shadow the human visitor who is amusing himself by watching its movements, or the all-powerful keeper who, at the unforeseen and fatal moment, postponed for the present in the case of the Baron (for whom the keeper, in Paris, will be Mme. Verdurin), will extract it without compunction from the place in which it was happily living to cast it into another. Moreover, the races of mankind, in so far as they are not merely collections of individuals, may furnish us with examples more vast, but identical in each of their parts, of this profound, obstinate and disconcerting blindness. Up to the present, if it was responsible for M. de Charlus\u2019s discoursing to the little clan remarks of a wasted subtlety or of an audacity which made his listeners smile at him in secret, it had not yet caused him, nor was it to cause him at Balbec any serious inconvenience. A trace of albumen, of sugar, of cardiac arythmia, does not prevent life from remaining normal for the man who is not even conscious of it, when only the physician sees in it a prophecy of catastrophes in store. At present the fondness \u2014 whether Platonic or not \u2014 that M. de Charlus felt for Morel merely led the Baron to say spontaneously in Morel\u2019s absence that he thought him very good looking, supposing that this would be taken in all innocence, and thereby acting like a clever man who when summoned to make a statement before a Court of Law will not be afraid to enter into details which are apparently to his disadvantage but for that very reason are more natural and less vulgar than the conventional protestations of a stage culprit. With the same freedom, always between Saint-Martin du Ch\u00e2ne and Donci\u00e8res-Ouest \u2014 or conversely on the return journey \u2014 M. de Charlus would readily speak of men who had, it appeared, very strange morals, and would even add: \u201cAfter all, I say strange, I don\u2019t know why, for there\u2019s nothing so very strange about that,\u201d to prove to himself how thoroughly he was at his ease with his audience. And so indeed he was, provided that it was he who retained the initiative, and that he knew his gallery to be mute and smiling, disarmed by credulity or good manners\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When M. de Charlus was not speaking of his admiration for Morel\u2019s beauty, as though it had no connexion with an inclination \u2014 called a vice \u2014 he would refer to that vice, but as though he himself were in no way addicted to it. Sometimes indeed he did not hesitate to call it by its name. As after examining the fine binding of his volume of Balzac I asked him which was his favourite novel in the Com\u00e9die Humaine, he replied, his thoughts irresistibly attracted to the same topic: \u201cEither one thing or the other, a tiny miniature like the Cur\u00e9 de Tours and the Femme abandonn\u00e9e, or one of the great frescoes like the series of Illusions perdues. What! You\u2019ve never read Illusions perdues? It\u2019s wonderful. The scene where Carlos Herrera asks the name of the ch\u00e2teau he is driving past, and it turns out to be Rastignac, the home of the young man he used to love. And then the abb\u00e9 falls into a reverie which Swann once called, and very aptly, the Tristesse d\u2019Olympia of paederasty. And the death of Lucien! I forgot who the man of taste was who, when he was asked what event in his life had most distressed him, replied: \u2018The death of Lucien de Rubempr\u00e9 in Splendeurs et Mis\u00e8res.\u2019\u201d \u201cI know that Balzac is all the rage this year, as pessimism was last,\u201d Brichot interrupted. \u201cBut, at the risk of distressing the hearts that are smitten with the Balzacian fever, without laying any claim, damme, to being a policeman of letters, or drawing up a list of offences against the laws of grammar, I must confess that the copious improviser whose alarming lucubrations you appear to me singularly to overrate, has always struck me as being an insufficiently meticulous scribe. I have read these Illusions perdues of which you are telling us, Baron, flagellating myself to attain to the fervour of an initiate, and I confess in all simplicity of heart that those serial instalments of bombastic balderdash, written in double Dutch \u2014 and in triple Dutch: Esther heureuse, O\u00f9 m\u00e8nent les mauvais chemins, A combien l\u2019amour revient aux vieillards, have always had the effect on me of the Myst\u00e8res de Rocambole, exalted by an inexplicable preference to the precarious position of a masterpiece.\u201d \u201cYou say that because you know nothing of life,\u201d said the Baron, doubly irritated, for he felt that Brichot would not understand either his aesthetic reasons or the other kind. \u201cI quite realise,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cthat, to speak like Master Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, you mean that I am moult sorbonagre, sorbonicole et sorboniforme. And yet, just as much as any of the comrades, I like a book to give an impression of sincerity and real life, I am not one of those clerks. . . . \u201d \u201cThe quart d\u2019heure de Rabelais,\u201d the Doctor broke in, with an air no longer of uncertainty but of assurance as to his own wit. \u201c . . . who take a vow of literature following the rule of the Abbaye-aux-Bois, yielding obedience to M. le Vicomte de Chateaubriand, Grand Master of common form, according to the strict rule of the humanists. M. le Vicomte de Chateaubriand\u2019s mistake. . . . \u201d \u201cWith fried potatoes?\u201d put in Dr. Cottard. \u201cHe is the patron saint of the brotherhood,\u201d continued Brichot, ignoring the wit of the Doctor, who, on the other hand, alarmed by the don\u2019s phrase, glanced anxiously at M. de Charlus. Brichot had seemed wanting in tact to Cottard, whose pun had brought a delicate smile to the lips of Princess Sherbatoff. \u201cWith the Professor, the mordant irony of the complete sceptic never forfeits its rights,\u201d she said kindly, to shew that the scientist\u2019s witticism had not passed unperceived by herself. \u201cThe sage is of necessity sceptical,\u201d replied the Doctor. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. Gnothi seauton, said Socrates. He was quite right, excess in anything is a mistake. But I am dumbfoundered when I think that those words have sufficed to keep Socrates\u2019s name alive all this time. What is there in his philosophy, very little when all is said. When one reflects that Charcot and others have done work a thousand times more remarkable, work which moreover is at least founded upon something, upon the suppression of the pupillary reflex as a syndrome of general paralysis, and that they are almost forgotten. After all, Socrates was nothing out of the common. They were people who had nothing better to do, and spent their time strolling about and splitting hairs. Like Jesus Christ: \u2018Love one another!\u2019 it\u2019s all very pretty.\u201d \u201cMy dear,\u201d Mme. Cottard implored. \u201cNaturally my wife protests, women are all neurotic.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear Doctor, I am not neurotic,\u201d murmured Mme. Cottard. \u201cWhat, she is not neurotic! When her son is ill, she exhibits phenomena of insomnia. Still, I quite admit that Socrates, and all the rest of them, are necessary for a superior culture, to acquire the talent of exposition. I always quote his gnothi seauton to my pupils at the beginning of the course. P\u00e8re Bouchard, when he heard of it, congratulated me.\u201d \u201cI am not one of those who hold to form for form\u2019s sake, any more than I should treasure in poetry the rhyme millionaire,\u201d replied Brichot. \u201cBut all the same the Com\u00e9die Humaine \u2014 which is far from human \u2014 is more than the antithesis of those works in which the art exceeds the matter, as that worthy hack Ovid says. And it is permissible to choose a middle course, which leads to the presbytery of Meudon or the hermitage of Ferney, equidistant from the Valley of Wolves, in which Ren\u00e9 superbly performed the duties of a merciless pontificate, and from les Jardies, where Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, browbeaten by the bailiffs, never ceased voiding upon paper to please a Polish woman, like a zealous apostle of balderdash.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cChateaubriand is far more alive now than you say, and Balzac is, after all, a great writer,\u201d replied M. de Charlus, still too much impregnated with Swann\u2019s tastes not to be irritated by Brichot, \u201cand Balzac was acquainted with even those passions which the rest of the world ignores, or studies only to castigate them. Without referring again to the immortal Illusions perdues; Sarrazine, La Fille aux yeux d\u2019or, Une passion dans le d\u00e9sert, even the distinctly enigmatic Fausse Ma\u00eetresse can be adduced in support of my argument. When I spoke of this \u2018unnatural\u2019 aspect of Balzac to Swann, he said to me: \u2018You are of the same opinion as Taine.\u2019 I never had the honour of knowing Monsieur Taine,\u201d M. de Charlus continued, with that irritating habit of inserting an otiose \u2018Monsieur\u2019 to which people in society are addicted, as though they imagine that by styling a great writer \u2018Monsieur\u2019 they are doing him an honour, perhaps keeping him at his proper distance, and making it evident that they do not know him personally. \u201cI never knew Monsieur Taine, but I felt myself greatly honoured by being of the same opinion as he.\u201d However, in spite of these ridiculous social affectations, M. de Charlus was extremely intelligent, and it is probable that if some remote marriage had established a connexion between his family and that of Balzac, he would have felt (no less than Balzac himself, for that matter) a satisfaction which he would have been unable to help displaying as a praiseworthy sign of condescension\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now and again, at the station after Saint-Martin du Ch\u00eane, some young men would get into the train. M. de Charlus could not refrain from looking at them, but as he cut short and concealed the attention that he was paying them, he gave it the air of hiding a secret, more personal even than his real secret; one would have said that he knew them, allowed his acquaintance to appear in spite of himself, after he had accepted the sacrifice, before turning again to us, like children who, in consequence of a quarrel among their respective parents, have been forbidden to speak to certain of their schoolfellows, but who when they meet them cannot forego the temptation to raise their heads before lowering them again before their tutor\u2019s menacing cane\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the word borrowed from the Greek with which M. de Charlus in speaking of Balzac had ended his comparison of the Tristesse d\u2019Olympiowith the Splendeurs et Mis\u00e8res, Ski, Brichot and Cottard had glanced at one another with a smile perhaps less ironical than stamped with that satisfaction which people at a dinner-party would shew who had succeeded in making Dreyfus talk about his own case, or the Empress Eug\u00e9nie about her reign. They were hoping to press him a little further upon this subject, but we were already at Donci\u00e8res, where Morel joined us. In his presence, M. de Charlus kept a careful guard over his conversation and, when Ski tried to bring it back to the love of Carlos Herrera for Lucien de Rubempr\u00e9, the Baron assumed the vexed, mysterious, and finally (seeing that nobody was listening to him) severe and judicial air of a father who hears people saying something indecent in front of his daughter. Ski having shewn some determination to pursue the subject, M. de Charlus, his eyes starting out of his head, raised his voice and said, in a significant tone, looking at Albertine, who as a matter of fact could not hear what we were saying, being engaged in conversation with Mme. Cottard and Princess Sherbatoff, and with the suggestion of a double meaning of a person who wishes to teach ill-bred people a lesson: \u201cI think it is high time we began to talk of subjects that are likely to interest this young lady.\u201d But I quite realised that, to him, the young lady was not Albertine but Morel; he proved, as it happened, later on, the accuracy of my interpretation by the expressions that he employed when he begged that there might be no more of such conversation in front of Morel. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said to me, speaking of the violinist, \u201cthat he is not at all what you might suppose, he is a very respectable youth who has always behaved himself, he is very serious.\u201d And one gathered from these words that M. de Charlus regarded sexual inversion as a danger as menacing to young men as prostitution is to women, and that if he employed the epithet \u2018respectable,\u2019 of Morel it was in the sense that it has when applied to a young shop-girl. Then Brichot, to change the conversation, asked me whether I intended to remain much longer at Incarville. I had pointed out to him more than once, but in vain, that I was staying not at Incarville but at Balbec, he always repeated the mistake, for it was by the name of Incarville or Balbec-Incarville that he described this section of the coast. There are people like that, who speak of the same things as ourselves but call them by a slightly different name. A certain lady of the Faubourg Saint-Germain used invariably to ask me, when she meant to refer to the Duchesse de Guermantes, whether I had seen Z\u00e9na\u00efde lately, or Oriane-Z\u00e9na\u00efde, the effect of which was that at first I did not understand her. Probably there had been a time when, some relative of Mme. de Guermantes being named Oriane, she herself, to avoid confusion, had been known as Oriane-Z\u00e9na\u00efde. Perhaps, too, there had originally been a station only at Incarville, from which one went in a carriage to Balbec. \u201cWhy, what have you been talking about?\u201d said Albertine, astonished at the solemn, paternal tone which M. de Charlus had suddenly adopted. \u201cAbout Balzac,\u201d the Baron hastily replied, \u201cand you are wearing this evening the very same clothes as the Princesse de Cadignan, not her first gown, which she wears at the dinnerparty, but the second.\u201d This coincidence was due to the fact that, in choosing Albertine\u2019s clothes, I sought inspiration in the taste that she had acquired thanks to Elstir, who greatly appreciated a sobriety which might have been called British, had it not been tempered with a gentler, more flowing grace that was purely French. As a rule the garments that he chose offered to the eye a harmonious combination of grey tones like the dress of Diane de Cadignan. M. de Charlus was almost the only person capable of appreciating Albertine\u2019s clothes at their true value; at a glance, his eye detected what constituted their rarity, justified their price; he would never have said the name of one stuff instead of another, and could always tell who had made them. Only he preferred \u2014 in women \u2014 a little more brightness and colour than Elstir would allow. And so this evening she cast a glance at me half smiling, half troubled, wrinkling her little pink cat\u2019s nose. Indeed, meeting over her skirt of grey cr\u00eape de chine, her jacket of grey cheviot gave the impression that Albertine was dressed entirely in grey. But, making a sign to me to help her, because her puffed sleeves needed to be smoothed down or pulled up, for her to get into or out of her jacket, she took it off, and as her sleeves were of a Scottish plaid in soft colours, pink, pale blue, dull green, pigeon\u2019s breast, the effect was as though in a grey sky there had suddenly appeared a rainbow. And she asked herself whether this would find favour with M. de Charlus. \u201cAh!\u201d he exclaimed in delight, \u201cnow we have a ray, a prism of colour. I offer you my sincerest compliments.\u201d \u201cBut it is this gentleman who has earned them,\u201d Albertine replied politely, pointing to myself, for she liked to shew what she had received from me. \u201cIt is only women who do not know how to dress that are afraid of colours,\u201d went on M. de Charlus. \u201cA dress may be brilliant without vulgarity and quiet without being dull. Besides, you have not the same reasons as Mme. de Cadignan for wishing to appear detached from life, for that was the idea which she wished to instil into d\u2019Arthez by her grey gown.\u201d Albertine, who was interested in this mute language of clothes, questioned M. de Charlus about the Princesse de Cadignan. \u201cOhl It is a charming tale,\u201d said the Baron in a dreamy tone. \u201cI know the little garden in which Diane de Cadignan used to stroll with M. d\u2019Espard. It belongs to one of my cousins.\u201d \u201cAll this talk about his cousin\u2019s garden,\u201d Brichot murmured to Cottard, \u201cmay, like his pedigree, be of some importance to this worthy Baron. But what interest can it have for us who are not privileged to walk in it, do not know the lady, and possess no titles of nobility?\u201d For Brichot had no suspicion that one might be interested in a gown and in a garden as works of art, and that it was in the pages of Balzac that M, de Charlus saw, in his mind\u2019s eye, the garden paths of Mme. de Cadignan. The Baron went on: \u201cBut you know her,\u201d he said to me, speaking of this cousin, and, by way of flattering me, addressing himself to me as to a person who, exiled amid the little clan, was to M. de Charlus, if not a citizen of his world, at any rate a visitor to it. \u201cAnyhow you must have seen her at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s.\u201d \u201cIs that the Marquise de Villeparisis who owns the chateau at Baucreux?\u201d asked Brichot with a captivated air. \u201cYes, do you know her?\u201d inquired M. de Charlus dryly. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cbut our colleague Norpois spends part of his holidays every year at Baucreux. I have had occasion to write to him there.\u201d I told Morel, thinking to interest him, that M. de Norpois was a friend of my father. But not a movement of his features shewed that he had heard me, so little did he think of my parents, so far short did they fall in his estimation of what my great-uncle had been, who had employed Morel\u2019s father as his valet, and, as a matter of fact, being, unlike the rest of the family, fond of not giving trouble, had left a golden memory among his servants. \u201cIt appears that Mme. de Villeparisis is a superior woman; but I have never been allowed to judge of that for myself, nor for that matter have any of my colleagues. For Norpois, who is the soul of courtesy and affability at the Institute, has never introduced any of us to the Marquise. I know of no one who has been received by her except our friend Thureau-Dangin, who had an old family connexion with her, and also Gaston Boissier, whom she was anxious to meet because of an essay which interested her especially. He dined with her once and came back quite enthralled by her charm. Mme. Boissier, however, was not invited.\u201d At the sound of these names, Morel melted in a smile. \u201cAh! Thureau-Dangin,\u201d he said to me with an air of interest as great as had been his indifference when he heard me speak of the Marquis de Norpois and my father. \u201cThureau-Dangin; why, he and your uncle were as thick as thieves. Whenever a lady wanted a front seat for a reception at the Academy, your uncle would say: \u2018I shall write to Thureau-Dangin.\u2019 And of course he got the ticket at once, for you can understand that M. Thureau-Dangin would never have dared to refuse anything to your uncle, who would have been certain to pay him out for it afterwards if he had. I can\u2019t help smiling, either, when I hear the name Boissier, for that was where your uncle ordered all the presents he used to give the ladies at the New Year. I know all about it, because I knew the person he used to send for them.\u201d He had not only known him, the person was his father. Some of these affectionate allusions by Morel to my uncle\u2019s memory were prompted by the fact that we did not intend to remain permanently in the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes, where we had taken an apartment only on account of my grandmother. Now and again there would be talk of a possible move. Now, to understand the advice that Charlie Morel gave me in this connexion, the reader must know that my great-uncle had lived, in his day, at 40_bis Boulevard Malesherbes. The consequence was that, in the family, as we were in the habit of frequently visiting my uncle Adolphe until the fatal day when I made a breach between my parents and him by telling them the story of the lady in pink, instead of saying \u2018at your uncle\u2019s\u2019 we used to say \u2018at 40_bis.\u2019 If I were going to call upon some kinswoman, I would be warned to go first of all \u2018to 40_bis,\u2019 in order that my uncle might not be offended by my not having begun my round with him. He was the owner of the house and was, I must say, very particular as to the choice of his tenants, all of whom either were or became his personal friends. Colonel the Baron de Vatry used to look in every day and smoke a cigar with him in the hope of making him consent to pay for repairs. The carriage entrance was always kept shut. If my uncle caught sight of a cloth or a rug hanging from one of the windowsills he would dash into the room and have it removed in less time than the police would take to do so nowadays. All the same, he did let part of the house, reserving for himself only two floors and the stables. In spite of this, knowing that he was pleased when people praised the house, we used always to talk of the comfort of the \u2018little mansion\u2019 as though my uncle had been its sole occupant, and he allowed us to speak, without uttering the formal contradiction that might have been expected. The \u2018little mansion\u2019 was certainly comfortable (my uncle having installed in it all the most recent inventions). But there was nothing extraordinary about it. Only, my uncle, while saying with a false modesty \u2018my little hovel,\u2019 was convinced, or in any case had instilled into his valet, the latter\u2019s wife, the coachman, the cook, the idea that there was no place in Paris to compare, for comfort, luxury, and general attractiveness, with the little mansion. Charles Morel had grown up in this belief. Nor had he outgrown it. And so, even on days when he was not talking to me, if in the train I mentioned to anyone else the possibility of our moving, at once he would smile at me and, with a wink of connivance, say: \u201cAh! What you want is something in the style of 40_bis! That\u2019s a place that would suit you down to the ground! Your uncle knew what he was about. I am quite sure that in the whole of Paris there\u2019s nothing to compare with 40_bis.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The melancholy air which M. de Charlus had assumed in speaking of the Princesse de Cadignan left me in no doubt that the tale in question had not reminded him only of the little garden of a cousin-to whom he was not particularly attached. He became lost in meditation, and, as though he were talking to himself: \u201cThe secrets of the Princesse de Cadignan!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cWhat a masterpiece! How profound, how heartrending the evil reputation of Diane, who is afraid that the man she loves may hear of it. What an eternal truth, and more universal than might appear, how far it extends!\u201d He uttered these words with a sadness in which nevertheless one felt that he found a certain charm. Certainly M. de Charlus, unaware to what extent precisely his habits were or were not known, had been trembling for some time past at the thought that when he returned to Paris and was seen there in Morel\u2019s company, the latter\u2019s family might intervene and so his future happiness be jeopardised. This eventuality had probably not appeared to him hitherto save as something profoundly disagreeable and painful. But the Baron was an artist to his finger tips. And now that he had begun to identify his own position with that described by Balzac, he took refuge, in a sense, in the tale, and for the calamity which was perhaps in store for him and did not in any case cease to alarm him, he had the consolation of finding in his own anxiety what Swann and also Saint-Loup would have called something \u2018quite Balzacian.\u2019 This identification of himself with the Princesse de Cadignan had been made easy for M. de Charlus by virtue of the mental transposition which was becoming habitual with him and of which he had already furnished several examples. It was enough in itself, moreover, to make the mere conversion of a woman, as the beloved object, into a young man immediately set in motion about him the whole sequence of social complications which develop round a normal love affair. When, for any reason, we introduce once and for all time a change in the calendar, or in the daily time-table, if we make the year begin a few weeks later, or if we make midnight strike a quarter of an hour earlier, as the days will still consist of twenty-four hours and the months of thirty days, everything that depends upon the measure of time will remain unaltered. Everything may have been changed without causing any disturbance, since the ratio of the figures is still the same. So it is with lives which adopt Central European time, or the Eastern calendar. It seems even that the gratification a man derives from keeping an actress played a part in these relations. When, after their first meeting, M. de Charlus had made inquiries as to Morel\u2019s actual position, he must certainly have learned that he was of humble extraction, but a girl with whom we are in love does not forfeit our esteem because she is the child of poor parents. On the other hand, the well known musicians to whom he had addressed his inquiries, had \u2014 and not even from any personal motive, unlike the friends who, when introducing Swann to Odette, had described her to him as more difficult and more sought after than she actually was \u2014 simply in the stereotyped manner of men in a prominent position overpraising a beginner, answered the Baron: \u201cAh! Great talent, has made a name for himself, of course he is still quite young, highly esteemed by the experts, will go far.\u201d And, with the mania which leads people who are innocent of inversion to speak of masculine beauty: \u201cBesides, it is charming to watch him play; he looks better than anyone at a concert; he has lovely hair, holds himself so well; his head is exquisite, he reminds one of a violinist in a picture.\u201d And so M. de Charlus, raised to a pitch of excitement moreover by Morel himself, who did not fail to let him know how many offers had been addressed to him, was flattered by the prospect of taking him home with him, of making a little nest for him to which he would often return. For during the rest of the time he wished him to enjoy his freedom, which was necessary to his career, which M. de Charlus meant him, however much money he might feel bound to give him, to continue, either because of the thoroughly \u2018Guermantes\u2019 idea that a man ought to do something, that he acquires merit only by his talent, and that nobility or money is simply the additional cypher that multiplies a figure, or because he was afraid lest, having nothing to do and remaining perpetually in his company, the violinist might grow bored. Moreover he did not wish to deprive himself of the pleasure which he found, at certain important concerts, in saying to himself: \u201cThe person they are applauding at this moment is coming home with me to-night.\u201d Fashionable people, when they are in love and whatever the nature of their love, apply their vanity to anything that may destroy the anterior advantages from which their vanity would have derived satisfaction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morel, feeling that I bore him no malice, being sincerely attached to M. de Charlus, and at the same time absolutely indifferent physically to both of us, ended by treating me with the same display of warm friendship as a courtesan who knows that you do not desire her and that her lover has a sincere friend in you who will not attempt to part him from her. Not only did he speak to me exactly as Rachel, Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress, had spoken to me long ago, but what was more, to judge by what M. de Charlus reported to me, he used to say to him about me in my absence the same things that Rachel had said about me to Robert. In fact M. de Charlus said to me: \u201cHe likes you so much,\u201d as Robert had said: \u201cShe likes you so much.\u201d And just as the nephew on behalf of his mistress, so it was on Morel\u2019s behalf that the uncle often invited me to come and dine with them. There were, for that matter, just as many storms between them as there had been between Robert and Rachel. To be sure, after Charlie (Morel) had left us, M. de Charlus would sing his praises without ceasing, repeating \u2014 the thought of it was flattering to him \u2014 that the violinist was so good to him. But it was evident nevertheless that often Charlie, even in front of all the faithful, wore an irritated expression, instead of always appearing happy and submissive as the Baron would have wished. This irritation became so violent in course of time, owing to the weakness which led M. de Charlus to forgive Morel his want of politeness, that the violinist made no attempt to conceal, if he did not even deliberately assume it. I have seen M. de Charlus, on entering a railway carriage in which Morel was sitting with some of his soldier friends, greeted with a shrug of the musician\u2019s shoulders, accompanied by a wink in the direction of his comrades. Or else he would pretend to be asleep, as though this incursion bored him beyond words. Or he would begin to cough, and the others would laugh, derisively mimicking the affected speech of men like M. de Charlus; would draw Charlie into a corner, from which he would return, as though under compulsion, to sit by M. de Charlus, whose heart was pierced by all these cruelties. It is inconceivable how he can have put up with them; and these ever varied forms of suffering set the problem of happiness in fresh terms for M. de Charlus, compelled him not only to demand more, but to desire something else, the previous combination being vitiated by a horrible memory. And yet, painful as these scenes came to be, it must be admitted that at first the genius of the humble son of France traced for Morel, made him assume charming forms of simplicity, of apparent frankness, even of an independent pride which seemed to be inspired by disinterestedness. This was not the case, but the advantage of this attitude was all the more on Morel\u2019s side since, whereas the person who is in love is continually forced to return to the charge, to increase his efforts, it is on the other hand easy for him who is not in love to proceed along a straight line, inflexible and graceful. It existed by virtue of the privilege of the race in the face \u2014 so open \u2014 of this Morel whose heart was so tightly shut, that face imbued with the neo-Hellenic grace which blooms in the basilicas of Champagne. Notwithstanding his affectation of pride, often when he caught sight of M. de Charlus at a moment when he was not expecting to see him, he would be embarrassed by the presence of the little clan, would blush, lower his eyes, to the delight of the Baron, who saw in this an entire romance. It was simply a sign of irritation and shame. The former sometimes found expression; for, calm and emphatically decent as Morel\u2019s attitude generally was, it was not without frequent contradictions. Sometimes, indeed, at something which the Baron said to him, Morel would come out, in the harshest tone, with an insolent retort which shocked everybody. M. de Charlus would lower his head with a sorrowful air, make no reply, and with that faculty which doting fathers possess of believing that the coldness, the rudeness of their children has passed unnoticed, would continue undeterred to sing the violinist\u2019s praises. M. de Charlus was not, indeed, always so submissive, but as a rule his attempts at rebellion proved abortive, principally because, having lived among people in society, in calculating the reactions that he might provoke he made allowance for the baser instincts, whether original or acquired. Now, instead of these, he encountered in Morel a plebeian tendency to spells of indifference. Unfortunately for M. de Charlus, he did not understand that, with Morel, everything else must give place when the Conservatoire (and the good reputation of the Conservatoire, but with this, which was to be a more serious matter, we are not at present concerned) was in question. Thus, for instance, people of the middle class will readily change their surnames out of vanity, noblemen for personal advantage. To the young violinist, on the contrary, the name Morel was inseparably linked with his first prize for the violin, and so impossible to alter. M. de Charlus would have liked Morel to take everything from himself, including a name. Going upon the facts that Morel\u2019s other name was Charles, which resembled Charlus, and that the place where they were in the habit of meeting was called les Charmes, he sought to persuade Morel that, a pleasant name, easy to pronounce, being half the battle for artistic fame, the virtuoso ought without hesitation to take the name Charmel, a discreet allusion to the scene of their intimacy. Morel shrugged his shoulders. As a conclusive argument, M. de Charlus was unfortunately inspired to add that he had a footman of that name. He succeeded only in arousing the furious indignation of the young man. \u201cThere was a time when my ancestors were proud of the title of groom, of butler to the King.\u201d \u201cThere was also a time,\u201d replied Morel haughtily, \u201cwhen my ancestors cut off your ancestors\u2019 heads.\u201d M. de Charlus would have been greatly surprised had he been told that even if, abandoning the idea of \u2018Channel,\u2019 he made up his mind to adopt Morel and to confer upon him one of the titles of the Guermantes family which were at his disposal but which circumstances, as we shall see, did not permit him to offer the violinist, the other would decline, thinking of the artistic reputation attached to the name Morel, and of the things that would be said about him in \u2018the class.\u2019 So far above the Faubourg Saint-Germain did he place the Rue Berg\u00e8re. And so M. de Charlus was obliged to content himself with having symbolical rings made for Morel, bearing the antique device: PLVS VLTRA CAR\u2019LVS. Certainly, in the face of an adversary of a sort with which he was unfamiliar, M. de Charlus ought to have changed his tactics. But which of us is capable of that? Moreover, if M. de Charlus made blunders, Morel was not guiltless of them either. Far more than the actual circumstance which brought about the rupture between them, what was destined, provisionally, at least (but this provisional turned out to be final), to ruin him with M. de Charlus was that his nature included not only the baseness which made him lie down under harsh treatment and respond with insolence to kindness. Running parallel to this innate baseness, there was in him a complicated neurasthenia of ill breeding, which, roused to activity on every occasion when he was in the wrong or was becoming a nuisance, meant that at the very moment when he had need of all his politeness, gentleness, gaiety, to disarm the Baron, he became sombre, petulant, tried to provoke discussions on matters where he knew that the other did not agree with him, maintained his own hostile attitude with a weakness of argument and a slashing violence which enhanced that weakness. For, very soon running short of arguments, he invented fresh ones as he went along, in which he displayed the full extent of his ignorance and folly. These were barely noticeable when he was in a friendly mood and sought only to please. On the contrary, nothing else was visible in his fits of sombre humour, when, from being inoffensive, they became odious. Whereupon M. de Charlus felt that he could endure no more, that his only hope lay in a brighter morrow, while Morel, forgetting that the Baron was enabling him to live in the lap of luxury, gave an ironical smile, of condescending pity, and said: \u201cI have never taken anything from anybody. Which means that there is nobody to whom I owe a word of thanks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, and as though he had been dealing with a man of the world, M. de Charlus continued to give vent to his rage, whether genuine or feigned, but in either case ineffective. It was not always so, however. Thus one day (which must be placed, as a matter of fact, subsequent to this initial period) when the Baron was returning with Charlie and myself from a luncheon party at the Verdurins\u2019, and expecting to spend the rest of the afternoon and the evening with the violinist at Donci\u00e8res, the latter\u2019s dismissal of him, as soon as we left the train, with: \u201cNo, I\u2019ve an engagement,\u201d caused M. de Charlus so keen a disappointment, that in spite of all his attempts to meet adversity with a brave face, I saw the tears trickling down and melting the paint beneath his eyes, as he stood helpless by the carriage door. Such was his grief that, since we intended, Albertine and I, to spend the rest of the day at Donci\u00e8res, I whispered to her that I would prefer that we did not leave M. de Charlus by himself, as he seemed, I could not say why, to be unhappy. The dear girl readily assented. I then asked M. de Charlus if he would not like me to accompany him for a little. He also assented, but declined to put my \u2018cousin\u2019 to any trouble. I found a certain charm (and one, doubtless, not to be repeated, since I had made up my mind to break with her), in saying to her quietly, as though she were my wife: \u201cGo back home by yourself, I shall see you this evening,\u201d and in hearing her, as a wife might, give me permission to do as I thought fit, and authorise me, if M. de Charlus, to whom she was attached, needed my company, to place myself at his disposal. We proceeded, the Baron and I, he waddling obesely, his Jesuitical eyes downcast, and I following him, to a caf\u00e9 where we were given beer. I felt M. de Charlus\u2019s eyes turning uneasily towards the execution of some plan. Suddenly he called for paper and ink, and began to write at an astonishing speed. While he covered sheet after sheet, his eyes glittered with furious fancies. When he had written eight pages: \u201cMay I ask you to do me a great service?\u201d he said to me. \u201cYou will excuse my sealing this note. I am obliged to do so. You will take a carriage, a motor-car if you can find one, to get there as quickly as possible. You are certain to find Morel in his quarters, where he has gone to change his clothes. Poor boy, he tried to bluster a little when we parted, but you may be sure that his heart is fuller than mine. You will give him this note, and, if he asks you where you met me, you will tell him that you stopped at Donci\u00e8res (which, for that matter, is the truth) to see Robert, which is not quite the truth perhaps, but that you met me with a person whom you do not know, that I seemed to be extremely angry, that you thought you heard something about sending seconds (I am, as a matter of fact, fighting a duel to-morrow). Whatever you do, don\u2019t say that I am asking for him, don\u2019t make any effort to bring him here, but if he wishes to come with you, don\u2019t prevent him from doing so. Go, my boy, it is for his good, you may be the means of averting a great tragedy. While you are away, I am going to write to my seconds. I have prevented you from spending the afternoon with your cousin. I hope that she will bear me no ill will for that, indeed I am sure of it. For hers is a noble soul, and I know that she is one of the people who are strong enough not to resist the greatness of circumstances. You must thank her on my behalf. I am personally indebted to her, and I am glad that it should be so.\u201d I was extremely sorry for M. de Charlus; it seemed to me that Charlie might have prevented this duel, of which he was perhaps the cause, and I was revolted, if that were the case, that he should have gone off with such indifference, instead of staying to help his protector. My indignation was increased when, on reaching the house in which Morel lodged, I recognised the voice of the violinist, who, feeling the need of an outlet for his happiness, was singing boisterously: \u201cSome Sunday morning, when the wedding-bells rrring!\u201d If poor M. de Charlus had heard him, he who wished me to believe, and doubtless believed himself, that Morel\u2019s heart at that moment was full! Charlie began to dance with joy when he caught sight of me. \u201cHallo, old boy I (excuse me, addressing you like that; in this damned military life, one picks up bad habits) what luck, seeing you. I have nothing to do all evening. Do let\u2019s go somewhere together. We can stay here if you like, or take a boat if you prefer that, or we can have some music, it\u2019s all the same to me.\u201d I told him that I was obliged to dine at Balbec, he seemed anxious that I should invite him to dine there also, but I refrained from doing so. \u201cBut if you\u2019re in such a hurry, why have you come here?\u201d \u201cI have brought you a note from M. de Charlus.\u201d At that moment all his gaiety vanished; his face contracted. \u201cWhat! He can\u2019t leave me alone even here. So I\u2019m a slave, am I? Old boy, be a sport. I\u2019m not going to open his letter. You can tell him that you couldn\u2019t find me.\u201d \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to open it, I fancy it contains something serious.\u201d \u201cNo, certainly not, you don\u2019t know all the lies, the infernal tricks that old scoundrel\u2019s up to. It\u2019s a dodge to make me go and see him. Very well! I\u2019m not going, I want to have an evening in peace.\u201d \u201cBut isn\u2019t there going to be a duel to-morrow?\u201d I asked Morel, whom I supposed to be equally well informed. \u201cA duel?\u201d he repeated with an air of stupefaction. \u201cI never heard a word about it. After all, it doesn\u2019t matter a damn to me, the dirty old beast can go and get plugged in the guts if he likes. But wait a minute, this is interesting, I\u2019m going to look at his letter after all. You can tell him that you left it here for me, in case I should come in.\u201d While Morel was speaking to me, I was looking with amazement at the beautiful books which M. de Charlus had given him, and which littered his room. The violinist having refused to accept those labelled: \u201cI belong to the Baron\u201d etc., a device which he felt to be insulting to himself, as a mark of vassalage, the Baron, with the sentimental ingenuity in which his ill-starred love abounded, had substituted others, originated by his ancestors, but ordered from the binder according to the circumstances of a melancholy friendship. Sometimes they were terse and confident, as Spes mea orExpectata non eludet. Sometimes merely resigned, as J\u2019attendrai. Others were gallant: Mesmes plaisir du mestre, or counselled chastity, such as that borrowed from the family of Simiane, sprinkled with azure towers and lilies, and given a fresh meaning: Sus-tendant lilia turres. Others, finally, were despairing, and appointed a meeting in heaven with him who had spurned the donor upon earth: Manet ultima caelo, and (finding the grapes which he had failed to reach too sour, pretending not to have sought what he had not secured) M. de Charlus said in one: Non mortale quod opto. But I had not time to examine them all\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If M. de Charlus, in dashing this letter down upon paper had seemed to be carried away by the demon that was inspiring his flying pen, as soon as Morel had broken the seal (a leopard between two roses gules, with the motto: atavis et armis) he began to read the letter as feverishly as M. de Charlus had written it, and over those pages covered at breakneck speed his eye ran no less rapidly than the Baron\u2019s pen. \u201cGood God!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthis is the last straw! But where am I to find him? Heaven only knows where he is now.\u201d I suggested that if he made haste he might still find him perhaps at a tavern where he had ordered beer as a restorative. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I shall be coming back,\u201d he said to his landlady, and added in petto, \u201cit will depend on how the cat jumps.\u201d A few minutes later we reached the caf\u00e9. I remarked M. de Charlus\u2019s expression at the moment when he caught sight of me. When he saw that I did not return unaccompanied, I could feel that his breath, his life were restored to him. Feeling that he could not get on that evening without Morel, he had pretended that somebody had told him that two officers of the regiment had spoken evil of him in connexion with the violinist and that he was going to send his seconds to call upon them. Morel had foreseen the scandal, his life in the regiment made impossible, and had hastened to the spot. In doing which he had not been altogether wrong. For to make his falsehood more plausible, M. de Charlus had already written to two of his friends (one was Cottard) asking them to be his seconds. And, if the violinist had not appeared, we may be certain that, in the frantic state in which M. de Charlus then was (and to change his sorrow into rage), he would have sent them with a challenge to some officer or other with whom it would have been a relief to him to fight. During the interval, M. de Charlus, remembering that he came of a race that was of purer blood than the House of France, told himself that it was really very good of him to take so much trouble over the son of a butler whose employer he would not have condescended to know. On the other hand, if his only amusement, almost, was now in the society of disreputable persons, the profoundly ingrained habit which such persons have of not replying to a letter, of failing to keep an appointment without warning you beforehand, without apologising afterwards, aroused in him, since, often enough, his heart was involved, such a wealth of emotion and the rest of the time caused him such irritation, inconvenience and anger, that he would sometimes begin to regret the endless letters over nothing at all, the scrupulous exactitude of Ambassadors and Princes, who, even if, unfortunately, their personal charms left him cold, gave him at any rate some sort of peace of mind. Accustomed to Morel\u2019s ways, and knowing how little hold he had over him, how incapable he was of insinuating himself into a life in which friendships that were vulgar but consecrated by force of habit occupied too much space and time to leave a stray hour for the great nobleman, evicted, proud, and vainly imploring, M. de Charlus was so convinced that the musician was not coming, was so afraid of losing him for ever if he went too far, that he could barely repress a cry of joy when he saw him appear. But feeling himself the victor, he felt himself bound to dictate the terms of peace and to extract from them such advantages as he might. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he said to him. \u201cAnd you?\u201d he went on, gazing at myself, \u201cI told you, whatever you did, not to bring him back with you.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to bring me,\u201d said Morel, turning upon M. de Charlus, in the artlessness of his coquetry, a glance conventionally mournful and languorously old-fashioned, with an air, which he doubtless thought to be irresistible, of wanting to kiss the Baron and to burst into tears. \u201cIt was I who insisted on coming in spite of him. I come, in the name of our friendship, to implore you on my bended knees not to commit this rash act.\u201d M. de Charlus was wild with joy. The reaction was almost too much for his nerves; he managed, however, to control them. \u201cThe friendship to which you appeal at a somewhat inopportune moment,\u201d he replied in a dry tone, \u201cought, on the contrary, to make you support me when I decide that I cannot allow the impertinences of a fool to pass unheeded. However, even if I chose to yield to the prayers of an affection which I have known better inspired, I should no longer be in a position to do so, my letters to my seconds have been sent off and I have no doubt of their consent. You have always behaved towards me like a little idiot and, instead of priding yourself, as you had every right to do, upon the predilection which I had shewn for you, instead of making known to the mob of serjeants or servants among whom the law of military service compels you to live, what a source of incomparable satisfaction a friendship such as mine was to you, you have sought to make excuses for yourself, almost to make an idiotic merit of not being grateful enough. I know that in so doing,\u201d he went on, in order not to let it appear how deeply certain scenes had humiliated him, \u201cyou are guilty merely of having let yourself be carried away by the jealousy of others. But how is it that at your age you are childish enough (and a child ill-bred enough) not to have seen at once that your election by myself and all the advantages that must result for you from it were bound to excite jealousies, that all your comrades while they egged you on to quarrel with me were plotting to take your place? I have not thought it necessary to tell you of the letters that I have received in that connexion from all the people in whom you place most confidence. I scorn the overtures of those flunkeys as I scorn their ineffective mockery. The only person for whom I care is yourself, since I am fond of you, but affection has its limits and you ought to have guessed as much.\u201d Harsh as the word flunkey might sound in the ears of Morel, whose father had been one, but precisely because his father had been one, the explanation of all social misadventures by \u2018jealousy,\u2019 an explanation fatuous and absurd, but of inexhaustible value, which with a certain class never fails to \u2018catch on\u2019 as infallibly as the old tricks of the stage with a theatrical audience or the threat of the clerical peril in a parliament, found in him an adherence hardly less solid than in Fran\u00e7oise, or the servants of Mme. de Guermantes, for whom jealousy was the sole cause of the misfortunes that beset humanity. He had no doubt that his comrades had tried to oust him from his position and was all the more wretched at the thought of this disastrous, albeit imaginary duel. \u201cOh! How dreadful!\u201d exclaimed Charlie. \u201cI shall never hold up my head again. But oughtn\u2019t they to see you before they go and call upon this officer?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, I suppose they ought. I\u2019ve sent word to one of them that I shall be here all evening and can give him his instructions.\u201d \u201cI hope that before he comes I can make you listen to reason; you will, anyhow, let me stay with you,\u201d Morel asked him tenderly. This was all that M. de Charlus wanted. He did not however yield at once. \u201cYou would do wrong to apply in this case the \u2018Whoso loveth well, chasteneth well\u2019 of the proverb, for it is yourself whom I loved well, and I intend to chasten even after our parting those who have basely sought to do you an injury. Until now, their inquisitive insinuations, when they dared to ask me how a man like myself could mingle with a boy of your sort, sprung from the gutter, I have answered only in the words of the motto of my La Rochefoucauld cousins: \u2018\u2019Tis my pleasure.\u2019 I have indeed pointed out to you more than once that this pleasure was capable of becoming my chiefest pleasure, without there resulting from your arbitrary elevation any degradation of myself.\u201d And in an impulse of almost insane pride he exclaimed, raising his arms in the air: \u201cTantus ab uno splendor! To condescend is not to descend,\u201d he went on in a calmer tone, after this delirious outburst of pride and joy. \u201cI hope at least that my two adversaries, notwithstanding their inferior rank, are of a blood that I can shed without reproach. I have made certain discreet inquiries in that direction which have reassured me. If you retained a shred of gratitude towards me, you ought on the contrary to be proud to see that for your sake I am reviving the bellicose humour of my ancestors, saying like them in the event of a fatal issue, now that I have learned what a little rascal you are: \u2018Death to me is life.\u2019\u201d And M. de Charlus said this sincerely, not only because of his love for Morel, but because a martial instinct which he quaintly supposed to have come down to him from his ancestors filled him with such joy at the thought of fighting that this duel, which he had originally invented with the sole object of making Morel come to him, he could not now abandon without regret. He had never engaged in any affair of the sort without at once imagining himself the victor, and identifying himself with the illustrious Constable de Guermantes, whereas in the case of anyone else this same action of taking the field appeared to him to be of the utmost insignificance. \u201cI am sure it will be a fine sight,\u201d he said to us in all sincerity, dwelling upon each word. \u201cTo see Sarah Bernhardt in L\u2019Aiglon, what is that but tripe? Mounet-Sully in Oedipus, tripe! At the most it assumes a certain pallid transfiguration when it is performed in the Arena of N\u00eemes. But what is it compared to that unimaginable spectacle, the lineal descendant of the Constable engaged in battle.\u201d And at the mere thought of such a thing, M. de Charlus, unable to contain himself for joy, began to make passes in the air which recalled Moli\u00e8re, made us take the precaution of drawing our glasses closer, and fear that, when the swords crossed, the combatants, doctor and seconds would at once be wounded. \u201cWhat a tempting spectacle it would be for a painter. You who know Monsieur Elstir,\u201d he said to me, \u201cyou ought to bring him.\u201d I replied that he was not in the neighbourhood. M. de Charlus suggested that he might be summoned by telegraph. \u201cOh! I say it in his interest,\u201d he added in response to my silence. \u201cIt is always interesting for a master \u2014 which he is, in my opinion \u2014 to record such an instance of racial survival. And they occur perhaps once in a century.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if M. de Charlus was enchanted at the thought of a duel which he had meant at first to be entirely fictitious, Morel was thinking with terror of the stories that might be spread abroad by the regimental band and might, thanks to the stir that would be made by this duel, penetrate to the holy of holies in the Rue Berg\u00e8re. Seeing in his mind\u2019s eye the \u2018class\u2019 fully informed, he became more and more insistent with M. de Charlus, who continued to gesticulate before the intoxicating idea of a duel. He begged the Baron to allow him not to leave him until the day after the next, the supposed day of the duel, so that he might keep him within sight and try to make him listen to the voice of reason. So tender a proposal triumphed over M. de Charlus\u2019s final hesitations. He said that he would try to find a way out of it, that he would postpone his final decision for two days. In this fashion, by not making any definite arrangement at once, M. de Charlus knew that he could keep Charlie with him for at least two days, and make use of the time to fix future engagements with him in exchange for his abandoning the duel, an exercise, he said, which in itself delighted him and which he would not forego without regret. And in saying this he was quite sincere, for he had always enjoyed taking the field when it was a question of crossing swords or exchanging shots with an adversary. Cottard arrived at length, although extremely late, for, delighted to act as second but even more upset by the prospect, he had been obliged to halt at all the caf\u00e9s or farms by the way, asking the occupants to be so kind as to shew him the way to \u2018No. 100\u2019 or \u2018a certain place.\u2019 As soon as he arrived, the Baron took him into another room, for he thought it more correct that Charlie and I should not be present at the interview, and excelled in making the most ordinary room serve for the time being as throne-room or council chamber. When he was alone with Cottard he thanked him warmly, but informed him that it seemed probable that the remark which had been repeated to him had never really been made, and requested that, in view of this, the Doctor would be so good as let the other second know that, barring possible complications, the incident might be regarded as closed. Now that the prospect of danger was withdrawn, Cottard was disappointed. He was indeed tempted for a moment to give vent to anger, but he remembered that one of his masters, who had enjoyed the most successful medical career of his generation, having failed to enter the Academy at his first election by two votes only, had put a brave face on it and had gone and shaken hands with his successful rival. And so the Doctor refrained from any expression of indignation which could have made no difference, and, after murmuring, he the most timorous of men, that there were certain things which one could not overlook, added that it was better so, that this solution delighted him. M. de Charlus, desirous of shewing his gratitude to the Doctor, just as the Duke his brother would have straightened the collar of my father\u2019s greatcoat or rather as a Duchess would put her arm round the waist of a plebeian lady, brought his chair close to the Doctor\u2019s, notwithstanding the dislike that he felt for the other. And, not only without any physical pleasure, but having first to overcome a physical repulsion, as a Guermantes, not as an invert, in taking leave of the Doctor, he clasped his hand and caressed it for a moment with the affection of a rider rubbing his horse\u2019s nose and giving it a lump of sugar. But Cottard, who had never allowed the Baron to see that he had so much as heard the vaguest rumours as to his morals, but nevertheless regarded him in his private judgment as one of the class of \u2018abnormals\u2019 (indeed, with his habitual inaccuracy in the choice of terms, and in the most serious tone, he said of one of M. Verdurin\u2019s footmen: \u201cIsn\u2019t he the Baron\u2019s mistress?\u201d), persons of whom he had little personal experience; imagined that this stroking of his hand was the immediate prelude to an act of violence in anticipation of which, the duel being a mere pretext, he had been enticed into a trap and led by the Baron into this remote apartment where he was about to be forcibly outraged. Not daring to stir from his chair, to which fear kept him glued, he rolled his eyes in terror, as though he had fallen into the hands of a savage who, for all he could tell, fed upon human flesh. At length M. de Charlus, releasing his hand and anxious to be hospitable to the end, said: \u201cWon\u2019t you come and take something with us, as the saying is, what in the old days used to be called a mazagran or a gloria, drinks that are no longer to be found, as archaeological curiosities, except in the plays of Labiche and the caf\u00e9s of Donci\u00e8res. A gloria would be distinctly suitable to the place, eh, and to the occasion, what do you say?\u201d \u201cI am President of the Anti-Alcohol League,\u201d replied Cottard. \u201cSome country sawbones has only got to pass, and it will be said that I do not practise what I preach. Os homini sublime dedit coelumque tueri,\u201d he added, not that this had any bearing on the matter, but because his stock of Latin quotations was extremely limited, albeit sufficient to astound his pupils. M. de Charlus shrugged his shoulders and led Cottard back to where we were, after exacting a promise of secrecy which was all the more important to him since the motive for the abortive duel was purely imaginary. It must on no account reach the ears of the officer whom he had arbitrarily selected as his adversary. While the four of us sat there drinking, Mme. Cottard, who had been waiting for her husband outside, where M. de Charlus could see her quite well, though he had made no effort to summon her, came in and greeted the Baron, who held out his hand to her as though to a housemaid, without rising from his chair, partly in the manner of a king receiving homage, partly as a snob who does not wish a woman of humble appearance to sit down at his table, partly as an egoist who enjoys being alone with his friends, and does not wish to be bothered. So Mme. Cottard remained standing while she talked to M. de Charlus and her husband. But, possibly because politeness, the knowledge of what \u2018ought to be done,\u2019 is not the exclusive privilege of the Guermantes, and may all of a sudden illuminate and guide the most uncertain brains, or else because, himself constantly unfaithful to his wife, Cottard felt at odd moments, as a sort of compensation, the need to protect her against anyone else who failed in his duty to her, the Doctor quickly frowned, a thing I had never seen him do before, and, without consulting M. de Charlus, said in a tone of authority: \u201cCome, L\u00e9ontine, don\u2019t stand about like that, sit down.\u201d \u201cBut are you sure I\u2019m not disturbing you?\u201d Mme. Cottard inquired timidly of M. de Charlus, who, surprised by the Doctor\u2019s tone, had made no observation. Whereupon, without giving him a second chance, Cottard repeated with authority: \u201cI told you to sit down.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently the party broke up, and then M. de Charlus said to Morel: \u201cI conclude from all this business, which has ended more happily than you deserved, that you are incapable of looking after yourself and that, at the expiry of your military service, I must lead you back myself to your father, like the Archangel Raphael sent by God to the young Tobias.\u201d And the Baron began to smile with an air of grandeur, and a joy which Morel, to whom the prospect of being thus led home afforded no pleasure, did not appear to share. In the exhilaration of comparing himself to the Archangel, and Morel to the son of Tobit, M. de Charlus no longer thought of the purpose of his speech which had been to explore the ground and see whether, as he hoped, Morel would consent to come with him to Paris. Intoxicated with his love or with his self-love, the Baron did not see or pretended not to see the violinist\u2019s wry grimace, for, leaving him by himself in the caf\u00e9, he said to me with a proud smile: \u201cDid you notice how, when I compared him to the son of Tobit, he became wild with joy? That was because, being extremely intelligent, he at once understood that the Father in whose company he was henceforth to live was not his father after the flesh, who must be some horrible valet with moustaches, but his spiritual father, that is to say Myself. What a triumph for him! How proudly he reared his head! What joy he felt at having understood me. I am sure that he will now repeat day by day: \u2018O God Who didst give the blessed Archangel Raphael as guide to thy servant Tobias, upon a long journey, grant to us, Thy servants, that we may ever be protected by him and armed with his succour.\u2019 I had no need even,\u201d added the Baron, firmly convinced that he would one day sit before the Throne of God, \u201cto tell him that I was the heavenly messenger, he realised it for himself, and was struck dumb with joy!\u201d And M. de Charlus (whom his joy, on the contrary, did not deprive of speech), regardless of the passers-by who turned to stare at him, supposing that he must be a lunatic, cried out by himself and at the top of his voice raising his hands in the air: \u201cAlleluia!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This reconciliation gave but a temporary respite to M. de Charlus\u2019s torments; often, when Morel had gone out on training too far away for M. de Charlus to be able to go and visit him or to send me to talk to him, he would write the Baron desperate and affectionate letters, in which he assured him that he was going to put an end to his life because, owing to a ghastly affair, he must have twenty-five thousand francs. He did not mention what this ghastly affair was, and had he done so, it would doubtless have been an invention. As far as the money was concerned, M. de Charlus would willingly have sent him it, had he not felt that it would make Charlie independent of him and free to receive the favours of some one else. And so he refused, and his telegrams had the dry, cutting tone of his voice. When he was certain of their effect, he hoped that Morel would never forgive him, for, knowing very well that it was the contrary that would happen, he could not help dwelling upon all the drawbacks that would be revived with this inevitable tie. But, if no answer came from Morel, he lay awake all night, had not a moment\u2019s peace, so great is the number of the things of which we live in ignorance, and of the interior and profound realities that remain hidden from us. And so he would form every conceivable supposition as to the enormity which put Morel in need of twenty-five thousand francs, gave it every possible shape, labelled it with, one after another, many proper names. I believe that at such moments M. de Charlus (in spite of the fact that his snobbishness, which was now diminishing, had already been overtaken if not outstripped by his increasing curiosity as to the ways of the lower orders) must have recalled with a certain longing the lovely, many-coloured whirl of the fashionable gatherings at which the most charming men and women sought his company only for the disinterested pleasure that it afforded them, where nobody would have dreamed of \u2018doing him down,\u2019 of inventing a \u2018ghastly affair,\u2019 on the strength of which one is prepared to take one\u2019s life, if one does not at once receive twenty-five thousand francs. I believe that then, and perhaps because he had after all remained more \u2018Combray\u2019 at heart than myself, and had grafted a feudal dignity upon his Germanic pride, he must have felt that one cannot with impunity lose one\u2019s heart to a servant, that the lower orders are by no means the same thing as society, that in short he did not \u2018get on\u2019 with the lower orders as I have always done\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next station upon the little railway, Maineville, reminds me of an incident in which Morel and M. de Charlus were concerned. Before I speak of it, I ought to mention that the halt of the train at Maineville (when one was escorting to Balbec a fashionable stranger, who, to avoid giving trouble, preferred not to stay at la Raspeli\u00e8re) was the occasion of scenes less painful than that which I am just about to describe. The stranger, having his light luggage with him in the train, generally found that the Grand Hotel was rather too far away, but, as there was nothing until one came to Balbec except small bathing places with uncomfortable villas, had, yielding to a preference for comfortable surroundings, resigned himself to the long journey when, as the train came to a standstill at Maineville, he saw the Palace staring him in the face, and never suspected that it was a house of ill fame. \u201cBut don\u2019t let us go any farther,\u201d he would invariably say to Mme. Cottard, a woman well-known for her practical judgment and sound advice. \u201cThere is the very thing I want. What is the use of going on to Balbec, where I certainly shan\u2019t find anything better. I can tell at a glance that it has all the modern comforts; I can quite well invite Mme. Verdurin there, for I intend, in return for her hospitality, to give a few little parties in her honour. She won\u2019t have so far to come as if I stay at Balbec. This seems to me the very place for her, and for your wife, my dear Professor. There are bound to be sitting rooms, we can have the ladies there. Between you and me, I can\u2019t imagine why Mme, Verdurin didn\u2019t come and settle here instead of taking la Raspeli\u00e8re. It is far healthier than an old house like la Raspeli\u00e8re, which is bound to be damp, and is not clean either, they have no hot water laid on, one can never get a wash. Now, Maineville strikes me as being far more attractive. Mme. Verdurin would have played the hostess here to perfection. However, tastes differ; I intend, anyhow, to remain here. Mme. Cottard, won\u2019t you come along with me; we shall have to be quick, for the train will be starting again in a minute. You can pilot me through that house, which you must know inside out, for you must often have visited it. It is the ideal setting for you.\u201d The others would have the greatest difficulty in making the unfortunate stranger hold his tongue, and still more in preventing him from leaving the train, while he, with the obstinacy which often arises from a blunder, insisted, gathered his luggage together and refused to listen to a word until they had assured him that neither Mme. Verdurin nor Mme. Cottard would ever come to call upon him there. \u201cAnyhow, I am going to make my headquarters there. Mme. Verdurin has only to write, if she wishes to see me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The incident that concerns Morel was of a more highly specialised order. There were others, but I confine myself at present, as the train halts and the porter calls out \u2018Donci\u00e8res,\u2019 \u2018Grattevast,\u2019 \u2018Maineville,\u2019 etc., to noting down the particular memory that the watering-place or garrison town recalls to me. I have already mentioned Maineville (media villa) and the importance that it had acquired from that luxurious establishment of women which had recently been built there, not without arousing futile protests from the mothers of families. But before I proceed to say why Maineville is associated in my memory with Morel and M. de Char-lus, I must make a note of the disproportion (which I shall have occasion to examine more thoroughly later on) between the importance that Morel attached to keeping certain hours free, and the triviality of the occupations to which he pretended to devote to them, this same disproportion recurring amid the explanations of another sort which he gave to M. de Charlus. He, who played the disinterested artist for the Baron\u2019s benefit (and might do so without risk, in view of the generosity of his protector), when he wished to have the evening to himself, in order to give a lesson, etc., never failed to add to his excuse the following words, uttered with a smile of cupidity: \u201cBesides, there may be forty francs to be got out of it. That\u2019s always something. You will let me go, for, don\u2019t you see it\u2019s all to my advantage. Damn it all, I haven\u2019t got a regular income like you, I have my way to make in the world, it\u2019s a chance of earning a little money.\u201d Morel, in professing his anxiety to give his lesson, was not altogether insincere. For one thing, it is false to say that money has no colour. A new way of earning them gives a fresh lustre to coins that are tarnished with use. Had he really gone out to give a lesson, it is probable that a couple of louis handed to him as he left the house by a girl pupil would have produced a different effect on him from a couple of louis coming from the hand of M. de Charlus. Besides, for a couple of louis the richest of men would travel miles, which become leagues when one is the son of a valet. But frequently M. de Charlus had his doubts as to the reality of the violin lesson, doubts which were increased by the fact that often the musician pleaded excuses of another sort, entirely disinterested from the material point of view, and at the same time absurd. In this Morel could not help presenting an image of his life, but one that deliberately, and unconsciously too, he so darkened that only certain parts of it could be made out. For a whole month he placed himself at M. de Charlus\u2019s disposal, on condition that he might keep his evenings free, for he was anxious to put in a regular attendance at a course of algebra. Come and see M. de Charlus after the class? Oh, that was impossible, the classes went on, sometimes, very late. \u201cEven after two o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d the Baron asked. \u201cSometimes.\u201d \u201cBut you can learn algebra just as easily from a book.\u201d \u201cMore easily, for I don\u2019t get very much out of the lectures.\u201d \u201cVery well, then! Besides, algebra can\u2019t be of any use to you.\u201d \u201cI like it. It soothes my nerves.\u201d \u201cIt cannot be algebra that makes him ask leave to go out at night,\u201d M. de Charlus said to himself. \u201cCan he be working for the police?\u201d In any case Morel, whatever objection might be made, reserved certain evening hours, whether for algebra or for the violin. On one occasion it was for neither, but for the Prince de Guermantes who, having come down for a few days to that part of the coast, to pay the Princesse de Luxembourg a visit, picked up the musician, without knowing who he was or being recognised by him either, and offered him fifty francs to spend the night with him in the brothel at Maineville; a twofold pleasure for Morel, in the profit received from M. de Guermantes and in the delight of being surrounded by women whose sunburned breasts would be visible to the naked eye. In some way or other M. de Charlus got wind of what had occurred and of the place appointed, but did not discover the name of the seducer. Mad with jealousy, and in the hope of finding out who he was, he telegraphed to Jupien, who arrived two days later, and when, early in the following week, Morel announced that he would again be absent, the Baron asked Jupien if he would undertake to bribe the woman who kept the establishment, and make her promise to hide the Baron and himself in some place where they could witness what occurred. \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll see to it, dearie,\u201d Jupien assured the Baron. It is hard to imagine to what extent this anxiety was agitating, and by so doing had momentarily enriched the mind of M. de Charlus. Love is responsible in this way for regular volcanic upheavals of the mind. In his, which, a few days earlier, resembled a plain so uniform that as far as the eye could reach it would have been impossible to make out an idea rising above the level surface, there had suddenly sprung into being, hard as stone, a chain of mountains, but mountains as elaborately carved as if some sculptor, instead of quarrying and carting his marble from them, had chiselled it on the spot, in which there writhed in vast titanic groups Fury, Jealousy, Curiosity, Envy, Hatred, Suffering, Pride, Terror and Love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the evening on which Morel was to be absent had come. Jupien\u2019s mission had proved successful. He and the Baron were to be there about eleven o\u2019clock, and would be put in a place of concealment. When they were still three streets away from this gorgeous house of prostitution (to which people came from all the fashionable resorts in the neighbourhood), M. de Charlus had begun to walk upon tiptoe, to disguise his voice, to beg Jupien not to speak so loud, lest Morel should hear them from inside. Whereas, on creeping stealthily into the entrance hall, M. de Charlus, who was not accustomed to places of the sort, found himself, to his terror and amazement, in a gathering more clamorous than the Stock Exchange or a sale room. It was in vain that he begged the girls who gathered round him to moderate their voices; for that matter their voices were drowned by the stream of announcements and awards made by an old \u2018assistant matron\u2019 in a very brown wig, her face crackled with the gravity of a Spanish attorney or priest, who kept shouting at every minute in a voice of thunder, ordering the doors to be alternately opened and shut, like a policeman regulating the flow of traffic: \u201cTake this gentleman to twenty-eight, the Spanish room.\u201d \u201cLet no more in.\u201d \u201cOpen the door again, these gentlemen want Mademoiselle No\u00e9mie. She\u2019s expecting them in the Persian parlour.\u201d M. de Charlus was as terrified as a countryman who has to cross the boulevards; while, to take a simile infinitely less sacrilegious than the subject represented on the capitals of the porch of the old church of Corleville, the voices of the young maids repeated in a lower tone, unceasingly, the assistant matron\u2019s orders, like the catechisms that we hear school-children chanting beneath the echoing vault of a parish church in the country. However great his alarm, M. de Charlus who, in the street, had been trembling lest he should make himself heard, convinced in his own mind that Morel was at the window, was perhaps not so frightened after all in the din of those huge staircases on which one realised that from the rooms nothing could be seen. Coming at length to the end of his calvary, he found Mlle. No\u00e9mie, who was to conceal him with Jupien, but began by shutting him up in a sumptuously furnished Persian sitting-room from which he could see nothing at all. She told him that Morel had asked for some orangeade, and that as soon as he was served the two visitors would be taken to a room with a transparent panel. In the meantime, as some one was calling for her, she promised them, like a fairy godmother, that to help them to pass the time she was going to send them a \u2018clever little lady.\u2019 For she herself was called away. The clever little lady wore a Persian wrapper, which she proposed to remove. M. de Charlus begged her to do nothing of the sort, and she rang for champagne which cost 40 francs a bottle. Morel, as a matter of fact, was, during this time, with the Prince de Guermantes; he had, for form\u2019s sake, pretended to go into the wrong room by mistake, had entered one in which there were two women, who had made haste to leave the two gentlemen undisturbed. M. de Charlus knew nothing of this, but was fidgeting with rage, trying to open the doors, sent for Mlle. No\u00e9mie, who, hearing the clever little lady give M. de Charlus certain information about Morel which was not in accordance with what she herself had told Jupien, banished her promptly, and sent presently, as a substitute for the clever little lady, a \u2018dear little lady\u2019 who exhibited nothing more but told them how respectable the house was and called, like her predecessor, for champagne. The Baron, foaming with rage, sent again for Mlle. No\u00e9mie, who said to them: \u201cYes, it is taking rather long, the ladies are doing poses, he doesn\u2019t look as if he wanted to do anything.\u201d Finally, yielding to the promises, the threats of the Baron, Mlle. No\u00e9mie went away with an air of irritation, assuring them that they would not be kept waiting more than five minutes. The five minutes stretched out into an hour, after which No\u00e9mie came and tiptoed in front of M. de Charlus, blind with rage, and Jupien plunged in misery, to a door which stood ajar, telling them: \u201cYou\u2019ll see splendidly from here. However, it\u2019s not very interesting just at present, he is with three ladies, he is telling them about life in his regiment.\u201d At length the Baron was able to see through the cleft of the door and also the reflexion in the mirrors beyond. But a deadly terror forced him to lean back against the wall. It was indeed Morel that he saw before him, but, as though the pagan mysteries and Enchantments still existed, it was rather the shade of Morel, Morel embalmed, not even Morel restored to life like Lazarus, an apparition of Morel, a phantom of Morel, Morel \u2018walking\u2019 or \u2018called up\u2019 in that room (in which the walls and couches everywhere repeated the emblems of sorcery), that was visible a few feet away from him, in profile. Morel had, as though he were already dead, lost all his colour; among these women, with whom one might have expected him to be making merry, he remained livid, fixed in an artificial immobility; to drink the glass of champagne that stood before him, his arm, sapped of its strength, tried in vain to reach out, and dropped back again. One had the impression of that ambiguous state implied by a religion which speaks of immorality but means by it something that does not exclude annihilation. The women were plying him with questions. \u201cYou see,\u201d Mlle. No\u00e9mie whispered to the Baron, \u201cthey are talking to him about his life in the regiment, it\u2019s amusing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u2014 here she laughed \u2014\u201cYou\u2019re glad you came? He is calm, isn\u2019t he,\u201d she added, as though she were speaking of a dying man. The women\u2019s questions came thick and fast, but Morel, inanimate, had not the strength to answer them. Even the miracle of a whispered word did not occur. M. de Charlus hesitated for barely a moment before he grasped what had really happened, namely that, whether from clumsiness on Jupien\u2019s part when he had called to make the arrangements, or from the expansive power of a secret lodged in any breast, which means that no secret is ever kept, or from the natural indiscretion of these ladies, or from their fear of the police, Morel had been told that two gentlemen had paid a large sum to be allowed to spy on him, unseen hands had spirited away the Prince de Guermantes, metamorphosed into three women, and had placed the unhappy Morel, trembling, paralysed with fear, in such a position that if M. de Charlus had but a poor view of him, he, terrorised, speechless, not daring to lift his glass for fear of letting it fall, had a perfect view of the Baron\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The story moreover had no happier ending for the Prince de Guermantes. When he had been sent away, so that M. de Charlus should not see him, furious at his disappointment, without suspecting who was responsible for it, he had implored Morel, still without letting him know who he was, to make an appointment with him for the following night in the tiny villa which he had taken and which, despite the shortness of his projected stay in it, he had, obeying the same insensate habit which we have already observed in Mme. de Villeparisis, decorated with a number of family keepsakes, so that he might feel more at home. And so, next day, Morel, turning his head every moment, trembling with fear of being followed and spied upon by M. de Charlus, had finally, having failed to observe any suspicious passer-by, entered the villa. A valet shewed him into the sitting-room, telling him that he would inform \u2018Monsieur\u2019 (his master had warned him not to utter the word \u2018Prince\u2019 for fear of arousing suspicions). But when Morel found himself alone, and went to the mirror to see that his forelock was not disarranged, he felt as though he were the victim of a hallucination. The photographs on the mantelpiece (which the violinist recognised, for he had seen them in M. de Charlus\u2019s room) of the Princesse de Guermantes, the Duchesse de Luxembourg, Mme. de Villeparisis, left him at first petrified with fright. At the same moment he caught sight of the photograph of M. de Charlus, which was placed a little behind the rest. The Baron seemed to be concentrating upon Morel a strange, fixed glare. Mad with terror, Morel, recovering from his first stupor, never doubting that this was a trap into which M. de Charlus had led him in order to put his fidelity to the test, sprang at one bound down the steps of the villa and set off along the road as fast as his legs would carry him, and when the Prince (thinking he had kept a casual acquaintance waiting sufficiently long, and not without asking himself whether it were quite prudent and whether the person might not be dangerous) entered the room, he found nobody there. In vain did he and his valet, afraid of burglary, and armed with revolvers, search the whole house, which was not large, every corner of the garden, the basement; the companion of whose presence he had been certain had completely vanished. He met him several times in the course of the week that followed. But on each occasion it was Morel, the dangerous person, who turned tail and fled, as though the Prince were more dangerous still. Confirmed in his suspicions, Morel never outgrew them, and even in Paris the sight of the Prince de Guermantes was enough to make him take to his heels. Whereby M. de Charlus was protected from a betrayal which filled him with despair, and avenged, without ever having imagined such a thing, still less how it came about\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But already my memories of what I have been told about all this are giving place to others, for the B. A. G., resuming its slow crawl, continues to set down or take up passengers at the following stations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Grattevast, where his sister lived with whom he had been spending the afternoon, there would sometimes appear M. Pierre de Verjus, Comte de Cr\u00e9cy (who was called simply the Comte de Cr\u00e9cy), a gentleman without means but of the highest nobility, whom I had come to know through the Cambremers, although he was by no means intimate with them. As he was reduced to an extremely modest, almost a penurious existence, I felt that a cigar, a \u2018drink\u2019 were things that gave him so much pleasure that I formed the habit, on the days when I could not see Albertine, of inviting him to Balbec. A man of great refinement, endowed with a marvellous power of self-expression, snow-white hair, and a pair of charming blue eyes, he generally spoke in a faint murmur, very delicately, of the comforts of life in a country house, which he had evidently known from experience, and also of pedigrees. On my inquiring what was the badge engraved on his ring, he told me with a modest smile: \u201cIt is a branch of verjuice.\u201d And he added with a relish, as though sipping a vintage: \u201cOur arms are a branch of verjuice \u2014 symbolic, since my name is Verjus \u2014 slipped and leaved vert.\u201d But I fancy that he would have been disappointed if at Balbec I had offered him nothing better to drink than verjuice. He liked the most expensive wines, because he had had to go without them, because of his profound knowledge of what he was going without, because he had a palate, perhaps also because he had an exorbitant thirst. And so when I invited him to dine at Balbec, he would order the meal with a refinement of skill, but ate a little too much, and drank copiously, made them warm the wines that needed warming, place those that needed cooling upon ice. Before dinner and after he would give the right date or number for a port or an old brandy, as he would have given the date of the creation of a marquisate which was not generally known but with which he was no less familiar\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I was in Airne\u2019s eyes a favoured customer, he was delighted that I should give these special dinners and would shout to the waiters: \u201cQuick, lay number 25\u201d; he did not even say \u2018lay\u2019 but \u2018lay me,\u2019 as though the table were for his own use. And, as the language of head waiters is not quite the same as of that of sub-heads, assistants, boys, and so forth, when the time came for me to ask for the bill he would say to the waiter who had served us, making a continuous, soothing gesture with the back of his hand, as though he were trying to calm a horse that was ready to take the bit in its teeth: \u201cDon\u2019t go too fast\u201d (in adding up the bill), \u201cgo gently, very gently.\u201d Then, as the waiter was retiring with this guidance, Aim\u00e9, fearing lest his recommendations might not be carried out to the letter, would call him back: \u201cHere, let me make it out.\u201d And as I told him not to bother: \u201cIt\u2019s one of my principles that we ought never, as the saying is, to sting a customer.\u201d As for the manager, since my guest was attired simply, always in the same clothes, which were rather threadbare (albeit nobody would so well have practised the art of dressing expensively, like one of Balzac\u2019s dandies, had he possessed the means), he confined himself, out of respect for me, to watching from a distance to see that everything was all right, and ordering, with a glance, a wedge to be placed under one leg of the table which was not steady. This was not to say that he was not qualified, though he concealed his early struggles, to lend a hand like anyone else. It required some exceptional circumstance nevertheless to induce him one day to carve the turkey-poults himself. I was out, but I heard afterwards that he carved them with a sacerdotal majesty, surrounded, at a respectful distance from the service-table, by a ring of waiters who were endeavouring thereby not so much to learn the art as to make themselves conspicuously visible, and stood gaping in open-mouthed admiration. Visible to the manager, for that matter (as he plunged a slow gaze into the flanks of his victims, and no more removed his eyes, filled with a sense of his exalted mission, from them than if he had been expected to read in them some augury), they were certainly not. The hierophant was not conscious of my absence even. When he heard of it, he was distressed: \u201cWhat, you didn\u2019t see me carving the turkey-poults myself?\u201d I replied that having failed, so far, to see Rome, Venice, Siena, the Prado, the Dresden gallery, the Indies, Sarah in Ph\u00e8dre, I had learned to resign myself, and that I would add his carving of turkey-poults to my list. The comparison with the dramatic art (Sarah in Ph\u00e8dre) was the only one that he seemed to understand, for he had already been told by me that on days of gala performances the elder Coque-lin had accepted a beginner\u2019s parts, even that of a character who says but a single line or nothing at all. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, I am sorry for your sake. When shall I be carving again? It will need some great event, it will need a war.\u201d (It did, as a matter of fact, need the armistice.) From that day onwards, the calendar was changed, time was reckoned thus: \u201cThat was the day after the day I carved the turkeys myself.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right, a week after the manager carved the turkeys himself.\u201d And so this prosectomy furnished, like the Nativity of Christ or the Hegira, the starting point for a calendar different from the rest, but neither so extensively adopted nor so long observed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sadness of M. de Cr\u00e9cy\u2019s life was due, just as much as to his no longer keeping horses and a succulent table, to his mixing exclusively with people who were capable of supposing that Cambremers and Guermantes were one and the same thing. When he saw that I knew that Legrandin, who had now taken to calling himself Legrand de M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, had no sort of right to that name, being moreover heated by the wine that he was drinking, he broke out in a transport of joy. His sister said to me with an understanding air: \u201cMy brother is never so happy as when he has a chance of talking to you.\u201d He felt indeed that he was alive now that he had discovered somebody who knew the unimportance of the Cambremers and the greatness of the Guermantes, somebody for whom the social universe existed. So, after the burning of all the libraries on the face of the globe and the emergence of a race entirely unlettered, an old Latin scholar would recover his confidence in life if he heard somebody quoting a line of Horace. And so, if he never left the train without saying to me: \u201cWhen is our next little gathering?\u201d, it was not so much with the hunger of a parasite as with the gluttony of a savant, and because he regarded our symposia at Balbec as an opportunity for talking about subjects which were precious to him and of which he was never able to talk to anyone else, and analogous in that way to those dinners at which assemble on certain specified dates, round the particularly succulent board of the Union Club, the Society of Bibliophiles. He was extremely modest, so far as his own family was concerned, and it was not from M. de Cr\u00e9cy that I learned that it was a very great family indeed, and a genuine branch transplanted to France of the English family which bears the title of Crecy. When I learned that he was a true Cr\u00e9cy, I told him that one of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s nieces had married an American named Charles Crecy, and said that I did not suppose there was any connexion between them. \u201cNone,\u201d he said. \u201cAny more than \u2014 not, of course, that my family is so distinguished \u2014 heaps of Americans who call themselves Montgomery, Berry, Chandos or Capel have with the families of Pembroke, Buckingham or Essex, or with the Duc de Berry.\u201d I thought more than once of telling him, as a joke, that I knew Mme. Swann, who as a courtesan had been known at one time by the name Odette de Cr\u00e9cy; but even if the Duc d\u2019Alencon had shewn no resentment when people mentioned in front of him \u00c9milienne d\u2019Alencon, I did not feel that I was on sufficiently intimate terms with M. de Cr\u00e9cy to carry a joke so far. \u201cHe comes of a very great family,\u201d M. de Montsurvent said to me one day. \u201cHis family name is Saylor.\u201d And he went on to say that on the wall of his old castle above Incarville, which was now almost uninhabitable and which he, although born to a great fortune, was now too much impoverished to put in repair, was still to be read the old motto of the family. I thought this motto very fine, whether applied to the impatience of a predatory race niched in that eyrie from which its members must have swooped down in the past, or at the present day, to its contemplation of its own decline, awaiting the approach of death in that towering, grim retreat. It is, indeed, in this double sense that this motto plays upon the name Saylor, in the words: \u201cNe s\u00e7ais l\u2019heure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Hermenonville there would get in sometimes M. de Chevregny, whose name, Brichot told us, signified like that of Mgr. de Cabri\u00e8res, a place where goats assemble. He was related to the Cambremers, for which reason, and from a false idea of what was fashionable, the latter often invited him to F\u00e9terne, but only when they had no other guests to dazzle. Living all the year round at Beausoleil, M. de Chevregny had remained more provincial than they. And so when he went for a few weeks to Paris, there was not a moment to waste if he was to \u2018see everything\u2019 in the time; so much so that occasionally, a little dazed by the number of spectacles too rapidly digested, when he was asked if he had seen a particular play he would find that he was no longer sure. But this uncertainty was rare, for he had that detailed knowledge of Paris only to be found in people who seldom go there. He advised me which of the \u2018novelties\u2019 I ought to see (\u201cIt\u2019s worth your while\u201d), regarding them however solely from the point of view of the pleasant evening that they might help to spend, and so completely ignoring the aesthetic point of view as never to suspect that they might indeed constitute a \u2018novelty\u2019 occasionally in the history of art. So it was that, speaking of everything in the same tone, he told us: \u201cWe went once to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, but the show there is nothing much. It\u2019s called Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande. It\u2019s rubbish. P\u00e9rier always acts well, but it\u2019s better to see him in something else. At the Gymnase, on the other hand, they\u2019re doing La Ch\u00e2telaine. We went again to it twice; don\u2019t miss it, whatever you do, it\u2019s well worth seeing; besides, it\u2019s played to perfection; you have Fr\u00e9valles, Marie Magnier, Baron fils\u201d; and he went on to quote the names of actors of whom I had never heard, and without prefixing Monsieur, Madame or Mademoiselle, like the Duc de Guermantes, who used to speak in the same ceremoniously contemptuous tone of the \u2018songs of Mademoiselle Yvette Guilbert\u2019 and the \u2018experiments of Monsieur Charcot.\u2019 This was not M. de Chevregny\u2019s way, he said \u201cCornaglia and Dehelly,\u201d as he might have said \u201cVoltaire and Montesquieu.\u201d For in him, with regard to actors as to everything that was Parisian, the aristocrat\u2019s desire to shew his scorn was overcome by the desire to appear on familiar terms of the provincial\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Immediately after the first dinner-party that I had attended at la Raspeli\u00e8re with what was still called at F\u00e9terne \u2018the young couple,\u2019 albeit M. and Mme. de Cambremer were no longer, by any means, in their first youth, the old Marquise had written me one of those letters which one can pick out by their handwriting from among a thousand. She said to me: \u201cBring your delicious \u2014 charming \u2014 nice cousin. It will be a delight, a pleasure,\u201d always avoiding, and with such unerring dexterity, the sequence that the recipient of her letter would naturally have expected, that I finally changed my mind as to the nature of these diminuendoes, decided that they were deliberate, and found in them the same corruption of taste \u2014 transposed into the social key \u2014 that drove Sainte-Beuve to upset all the normal relations between words, to alter any expression that was at all conventional. Two methods, taught probably by different masters, came into conflict in this epistolary style, the second making Mme. de Cambremer redeem the monotony of her multiple adjectives by employing them in a descending scale, by avoiding an ending upon the perfect chord. On the other hand, I was inclined to see in these inverse gradations, not an additional refinement, as when they were the handiwork of the Dowager Marquise, but an additional clumsiness whenever they were employed by the Marquis her son or by his lady cousins. For throughout the family, to quite a remote degree of kinship and in admiring imitation of aunt Z\u00e9lia, the rule of the three adjectives was held in great honour, as was a certain enthusiastic way of catching your breath when you were talking. An imitation that had passed into the blood, moreover; and whenever, in the family circle, a little girl, while still in the nursery, stopped short while she was talking to swallow her saliva, her parents would say: \u201cShe takes after aunt Z\u00e9lia,\u201d would feel that as she grew up, her upper lip would soon tend to hide itself beneath a faint moustache, and would make up their minds to cultivate her inherited talent for music. It was not long before the Cambremers were on less friendly terms with Mme. Verdurin than with myself, for different reasons. They felt, they must invite her to dine. The \u2018young\u2019 Marquise said to me contemptuously: \u201cI don\u2019t see why we shouldn\u2019t invite that woman, in the country one meets anybody, it needn\u2019t involve one in anything.\u201d But being at heart considerably impressed, they never ceased to consult me as to the way in which they should carry out their desire to be polite. I thought that as they had invited Albertine and myself to dine with some friends of Saint-Loup, smart people of the neighbourhood, who owned the ch\u00e2teau of Gourville, and represented a little more than the cream of Norman society, for which Mme. Verdurin, while pretending never to look at it, thirsted, I advised the Cambremers to invite the Mistress to meet them. But the lord and lady of F\u00e9terne, in their fear (so timorous were they) of offending their noble friends, or (so simple were they) that M. and Mme. Verdurin might be bored by people who were not intellectual, or yet again (since they were impregnated with a spirit of routine which experience had not fertilised) of mixing different kinds of people, and making a social blunder, declared that it would not be a success, and that it would be much better to keep Mme. Verdurin (whom they would invite with all her little group) for another evening. For this coming evening \u2014 the smart one, to meet Saint-Loup\u2019s friends \u2014 they invited nobody from the little nucleus but Morel, in order that M. de Charlus might indirectly be informed of the brilliant people whom they had in their house, and also that the musician might help them to entertain their guests, for he was to be asked to bring his violin. They threw in Cottard as well, because M. de Cambremer declared that he had \u2018a go\u2019 about him, and would be a success at the dinner-table; besides, it might turn out useful to be on friendly terms with a doctor, if they should ever have anybody ill in the house. But they invited him by himself, so as not to \u2018start any complications with the wife.\u2019 Mme. Verdurin was furious when she heard that two members of the little group had been invited without herself to dine at F\u00e9terne \u2018quite quietly.\u2019 She dictated to the doctor, whose first impulse had been to accept, a stiff reply in which he said: \u201cWe are dining that evening with Mme. Verdurin,\u201d a plural which was to teach the Cambremers a lesson, and to shew them that he was not detachable from Mme. Cottard. As for Morel, Mme. Verdurin had no need to outline a course of impolite behaviour for him, he found one of his own accord, for the following reason. If he preserved, with regard to M. de Charlus, in so far as his pleasures were concerned, an independence which distressed the Baron, we have seen that the latter\u2019s influence was making itself felt more and more in other regions, and that he had for instance enlarged the young virtuoso\u2019s knowledge of music and purified his style. But it was still, at this point in our story, at least, only an influence. At the same time there was one subject upon which anything that M. de Charlus might say was blindly accepted and put into practice by Morel. Blindly and foolishly, for not only were M. de Charlus\u2019s instructions false, but, even had they been justifiable in the case of a great gentleman, when applied literally by Morel they became grotesque. The subject as to which Morel was becoming so credulous and obeyed his master with such docility was that of social distinction. The violinist, who, before making M. de Charlus\u2019s acquaintance, had had no conception of society, had taken literally the brief and arrogant sketch of it that the Baron had outlined for him. \u201cThere are a certain number of outstanding families,\u201d M. de Charlus had told him, \u201cfirst and foremost the Guermantes, who claim fourteen alliances with the House of France, which is flattering to the House of France if anything, for it was to Aldonce de Guermantes and not to Louis the Fat, his consanguineous but younger brother, that the Throne of France should have passed. Under Louiv XIV, we \u2018draped\u2019 at the death of Monsieur, having the same grandmother as the king; a long way below the Guermantes, one may however mention the families of La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, descended from the Kings of Naples and the Counts of Poitiers; of d\u2019Uz\u00e8s, scarcely old as a family, but the premier peers; of Luynes, who are of entirely recent origin, but have distinguished themselves by good marriages; of Choiseul, Harcourt, La Rochefoucauld. Add to these the family of the Noailles (notwithstanding the Comte de Toulouse), Montesquieu and Castellane, and, I think I am right in saying, those are all. As for all the little people who call themselves Marquis de Cambremerde or de Vatefairefiche, there is no difference between them and the humblest private in your regiment. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you go and p \u2014-at Comtesse S\u2014 t\u2019s or s \u2014 t at Baronne P\u2014\u2018s, it\u2019s exactly the same, you will have compromised yourself and have used a dirty rag instead of toilet paper. Which is not nice.\u201d Morel had piously taken in this history lesson, which was perhaps a trifle cursory, and looked upon these matters as though he were himself a Guermantes and hoped that he might some day have an opportunity of meeting the false La Tour d\u2019Auvergnes in order to let them see, by the contemptuous way in which he shook hands, that he did not take them very seriously. As for the Cambremers, here was his very chance to prove to them that they were no better than \u2018the humblest private in his regiment.\u2019 He did not answer their invitation, and on the evening of the dinner declined at the last moment by telegram, as pleased with himself as if he had behaved like a Prince of Blood. It must be added here that it is impossible to imagine how intolerable and interfering M. de Charlus could be, in a more general fashion, and even, he who was so clever, how stupid, on all occasions when the flaws in his character came into play. We may say indeed that these flaws are like an intermittent malady of the mind. Who has not observed the fact among women, and even among men, endowed with remarkable intelligence but afflicted with nerves, when they are happy, calm, satisfied with their surroundings, we cannot help admiring their precious gifts, the words that fall from their lips are the literal truth. A touch of headache, the slightest injury to their self-esteem is enough to alter everything. The luminous intelligence, become abrupt, convulsive and narrow, reflects nothing but an irritated, suspicious, teasing self, doing everything that it can to give trouble. The Cambremers were extremely angry; and in the interval other incidents brought about a certain tension in their relations with the little clan. As we were returning, the Cottards, Charlus, Brichot, Morel and I, from a dinner at la Raspeli\u00e8re, one evening after the Cambremers who had been to luncheon with friends at Harambouville had accompanied us for part of our outward journey: \u201cYou who are so fond of Balzac, and can find examples of him in the society of to-day,\u201d I had remarked to M. de Charlus, \u201cyou must feel that those Cambremers come straight out of the Sc\u00e8nes de la Vie de Province.\u201d But M. de Charlus, for all the world as though he had been their friend, and I had offended him by my remark, at once cut me short: \u201cYou say that because the wife is superior to the husband,\u201d he informed me in a dry tone. \u201cOh, I wasn\u2019t suggesting that she was the Muse du d\u00e9partement, or Mme. de Bargeton, although. . . . \u201d M. de Charlus again interrupted me: \u201cSay rather, Mme. de Mortsauf.\u201d The train stopped and Brichot got out. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see us making signs to you? You are incorrigible.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWhy, have you never noticed that Brichot is madly in love with Mme. de Cambremer?\u201d I could see from the attitude of Cottard and Charlie that there was not a shadow of doubt about this in the little nucleus. I felt that it shewed a trace of malice on their part. \u201cWhat, you never noticed how distressed he became when you mentioned her,\u201d went on M. de Charlus, who liked to shew that he had experience of women, and used to speak of the sentiment which they inspire with a natural air and as though this were the sentiment which he himself habitually felt. But a certain equivocally paternal tone in addressing all young men \u2014 notwithstanding his exclusive affection for Morel \u2014 gave the lie to the views of a woman-loving man which he expressed. \u201cOh! These children,\u201d he said in a shrill, mincing, sing-song voice, \u201cone has to teach them everything, they are as innocent as a newborn babe, they can\u2019t even tell when a man is in love with a woman. I wasn\u2019t such a chicken at your age,\u201d he added, for he liked to use the expressions of the underworld, perhaps because they appealed to him, perhaps so as not to appear, by avoiding them, to admit that he consorted with people whose current vocabulary they were. A few days later, I was obliged to yield to the force of evidence, and admit that Brichot was enamoured of the Marquise. Unfortunately he accepted several invitations to luncheon with her. Mme. Verdurin decided that it was time to put a stop to these proceedings. Quite apart from the importance of such an intervention to her policy in controlling the little nucleus, explanations of this sort and the dramas to which they gave rise caused her an ever increasing delight which idleness breeds just as much in the middle classes as in the aristocracy. It was a day of great emotion at la Raspeli\u00e8re when Mme. Verdurin was seen to disappear for a whole hour with Brichot, whom (it was known) she proceeded to inform that Mme. de Cambremer was laughing at him, that he was the joke of her drawing-room, that he would end his days in disgrace, having forfeited his position in the teaching world. She went so far as to refer in touching terms to the laundress with whom he was living in Paris, and to their little girl. She won the day, Brichot ceased to go to F\u00e9terne, but his grief was such that for two days it was thought that he would lose his sight altogether, while in any case his malady increased at a bound and held the ground it had won. In the meantime, the Cambremers, who were furious with Morel, invited M. de Charlus on one occasion, deliberately, without him. Receiving no reply from the Baron, they began to fear that they had committed a blunder, and, deciding that malice made an evil counsellor, wrote, a little late in the day, to Morel, an ineptitude which made M. de Charlus smile, as it proved to him the extent of his power. \u201cYou shall answer for us both that I accept,\u201d he said to Morel. When the evening of the dinner came, the party assembled in the great drawing-room of F\u00e9terne. In reality, the Cambremers were giving this dinner for those fine flowers of fashion M. and Mme. F\u00e9r\u00e9. But they were so much afraid of displeasing M. de Charlus, that although she had got to know the F\u00e9r\u00e9s through M. de Chevregny, Mme. de Cambremer went into a fever when, on the afternoon before the dinner, she saw him arrive to pay a call on them at F\u00e9terne. She made every imaginable excuse for sending him back to Beausoleil as quickly as possible, not so quickly, however, that he did not pass, in the courtyard, the F\u00e9r\u00e9s, who were as shocked to see him dismissed like this as he himself was ashamed. But, whatever happened, the Cambremers wished to spare M. de Charlus the sight of M. de Chevregny, whom they judged to be provincial because of certain little points which are overlooked in the family circle and become important only in the presence of strangers, who are the last people in the world to notice them. But we do not like to display to them relatives who have remained at the stage which we ourselves have struggled to outgrow. As for M. and Mme. F\u00e9r\u00e9, they were, in the highest sense of the words, what are called \u2018really nice people.\u2019 In the eyes of those who so defined them, no doubt the Guermantes, the Rohans and many others were also really nice people, but their name made it unnecessary to say so. As everybody was not aware of the exalted birth of Mme. F\u00e9r\u00e9\u2018s mother, and the extraordinarily exelusive circle in which she and her husband moved, when you mentioned their name, you invariably added by way of explanation that they were \u2018the very best sort.\u2019 Did their obscure name prompt them to a sort of haughty reserve? However that may be, the fact remains that the F\u00e9r\u00e9s refused to know people on whom a La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle would have called. It needed the position of queen of her particular stretch of coast, which the old Marquise de Cambremer held in the Manche, to make the F\u00e9r\u00e9s consent to come to one of her afternoons every year. The Cambremers had invited them to dinner and were counting largely on the effect that would be made on them by M. de Charlus. It was discreetly announced that he was to be one of the party. As it happened, Mme. F\u00e9r\u00e9 had never met him. Mme. de Cambremer, on learning this, felt a keen satisfaction, and the smile of the chemist who is about to bring into contact for the first time two particularly important bodies hovered over her face. The door opened, and Mme. de Cambremer almost fainted when she saw Morel enter the room alone. Like a private secretary charged with apologies for his Minister, like a morganatic wife vho expresses the Prince\u2019s regret that he is unwell (so Mme. de Clinchamp used to apologise for the Duc d\u2019Aumale), Morel said in the airiest of tones: \u201cThe Baron can\u2019t come. He is not feeling very well, at least I think that is why, I haven\u2019t seen him this week,\u201d he added, these last words completing the despair of Mme. de Cambremer, who had told M. and Mme. F\u00e9r\u00e9 that Morel saw M. de Charlus at every hour of the day. The Cambremers pretended that the Baron\u2019s absence gave an additional attraction to their party, and without letting Morel hear them, said to their other guests: \u201cWe can do very well without him, can\u2019t we, it will be all the better.\u201d But they were furious, suspected a plot hatched by Mme. Verdurin, and, tit for tat, when she invited them again to la Raspeli\u00e8re, M. de Cambremer, unable to resist the pleasure of seeing his house again and of mingling with the little group, came, but came alone, saying that the Marquise was so sorry, but her doctor had ordered her to stay in her room. The Cambremers hoped by this partial attendance at once to teach M. de Charlus a lesson, and to shew the Verdurins that they were not obliged to treat them with more than a limited politeness, as Princesses of the Blood used in the old days to \u2018shew out\u2019 Duchesses, but only to the middle of the second saloon. After a few weeks, they were scarcely on speaking terms. M. de Cambremer explained this to me as follows: \u201cI must tell you that with M. de Charlus it was rather difficult. He is an extreme Dreyfusard. . . . \u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d \u201cYes. . . . Anyhow his cousin the Prince de Guermantes is, they\u2019ve come in for a lot of abuse over that. I have some relatives who are very particular about that sort of thing. I can\u2019t afford to mix with those people, I should quarrel with the whole of my family.\u201d \u201cSince the Prince de Guermantes is a Dreyfusard, that will make it all the easier,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cfor Saint-Loup, who is said to be going to marry his niece, is one too. Indeed, that is perhaps why he is marrying her.\u201d \u201cCome now, my dear, you mustn\u2019t say that Saint-Loup, who is a great friend of ours, is a Dreyfusard. One ought not to make such allegations lightly,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cYou would make him highly popular in the army!\u201d \u201cHe was once, but he isn\u2019t any longer,\u201d I explained to M. de Cambremer. \u201cAs for his marrying Mlle, de Guermantes-Brassac, is there any truth in that?\u201d \u201cPeople are talking of nothing else, but you should be in a position to know.\u201d \u201cBut I repeat that he told me himself, he was a Dreyfusard,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer. \u201cNot that there isn\u2019t every excuse for him, the Guermantes are half German.\u201d \u201cThe Guermantes in the Rue de Varenne, you can say, are entirely German,\u201d said Cancan. \u201cBut Saint-Loup is a different matter altogether; he may have any amount of German blood, his father insisted upon maintaining his title as a great nobleman of France, he rejoined the service in 1871 and was killed in the war in the most gallant fashion. I may take rather a strong line about these matters, but it doesn\u2019t do to exaggerate either one way or the other. In medio . . . virtus, ah, I forget the exact words. It\u2019s a remark Doctor Cottard made. Now, there\u2019s a man who can always say the appropriate thing. You ought to have a small Larousse in the house.\u201d To avoid having to give an opinion as to the Latin quotation, and to get away from the subject of Saint-Loup, as to whom her husband seemed to think that she was wanting in tact, Mme. de Cambremer fell back upon the Mistress whose quarrel with them was even more in need of an explanation. \u201cWe were delighted to let la Raspeli\u00e8re to Mme, Verdurin,\u201d said the Marquise. \u201cThe only trouble is, she appears to imagine that with the house, and everything else that she has managed to tack on to it, the use of the meadow, the old hangings, all sorts of things which weren\u2019t in the lease at all, she should also be entitled to make friends with us. The two things are entirely distinct. Our mistake lay in our not having done everything quite simply through a lawyer or an agency. At F\u00e9terne it doesn\u2019t matter, but I can just imagine the face my aunt de Ch\u2019nouville would make if she saw old mother Verdurin come marching in, on one of my days, with her hair streaming. As for M. de Charlus, of course, he knows some quite nice people, but he knows some very nasty people too.\u201d I asked for details. Driven into a corner, Mme. de Cambremer finally admitted: \u201cPeople say that it was he who maintained a certain Monsieur Moreau, Morille, Morue, I don\u2019t remember. Nothing to do, of course, with Morel, the violinist,\u201d she added, blushing. \u201cWhen I realised that Mme. Verdurin imagined that because she was our tenant in the Manche, she would have the right to come and call upon me in Paris, I saw that it was time to cut the cable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding this quarrel with the Mistress, the Cambremers were on quite good terms with the faithful, and would readily get into our carriage when they were travelling by the train. Just before we reached Douville, Albertine, taking out her mirror for the last time, would sometimes feel obliged to change her gloves, or to take off her hat for a moment, and, with the tortoiseshell comb which I had given her and which she wore in her hair, would smooth the plaits, pull out the puffs, and if necessary, over the undulations which descended in regular valleys to the nape of her neck, push up her chignon. Once we were in the carriages which had come to meet us, we no longer had any idea where we were; the roads were not lighted; we could tell by the louder sound of the wheels that we were passing through a village, we thought we had arrived, we found ourselves once more in the open country, we heard bells in the distance, we forgot that we were in evening dress, and had almost fallen asleep when, at the end of this wide borderland of darkness which, what with the distance we had travelled and the incidents characteristic of all railway journeys, seemed to have carried us on to a late hour of the night and almost half way back to Paris, suddenly after the crunching of the carriage wheels over a finer gravel had revealed to us that we had turned into the park, there burst forth, reintroducing us into a social existence, the dazzling lights of the drawing-room, then of the dining-room where we were suddenly taken aback by hearing eight o\u2019clock strike, that hour which we supposed to have so long since passed, while the endless dishes and vintage wines followed one another round men in black and women with bare arms, at a dinner-party ablaze with light like any real dinner-party, surrounded only, and thereby changing its character, by the double veil, sombre and strange, that was woven for it, with a sacrifice of their first solemnity to this social purpose, by the nocturnal, rural, seaside hours of the journey there and back. The latter indeed obliged us to leave the radiant and soon forgotten splendour of the lighted drawing-room for the carriages in which I arranged to sit beside Albertine so that my mistress might not be left with other people in my absence, and often for another reason as well, which was that we could both do many things in a dark carriage, in which the jolts of the downward drive would moreover give us an excuse, should a sudden ray of light fall upon us, for clinging to one another. When M. de Cambremer was still on visiting terms with the Verdurins, he would ask me: \u201cYou don\u2019t think that this fog will bring on your choking fits? My sister was terribly bad this morning. Ah! You have been having them too,\u201d he said with satisfaction. \u201cI shall tell her that to-night. I know that, as soon as I get home, the first thing she will ask will be whether you have had any lately.\u201d He spoke to me of my sufferings only to lead up to his sister\u2019s, and made me describe mine in detail simply that he might point out the difference between them and hers. But notwithstanding these differences, as he felt that his sister\u2019s choking fits entitled him to speak with authority, he could not believe that what \u2018succeeded\u2019 with hers was not indicated as a cure for mine, and it irritated him that I would not try these remedies, for if there is one thing more difficult than submitting oneself to a regime it is refraining from imposing it upon other people. \u201cNot that I need speak, a mere outsider, when you are here before the areopagus, at the fountainhead of wisdom. What does Professor Cottard think about them?\u201d I saw his wife once again, as a matter of fact, because she had said that my \u2018cousin\u2019 had odd habits, and I wished to know what she meant by that. She denied having said it, but finally admitted that she had been speaking of a person whom she thought she had seen with my cousin. She did not know the person\u2019s name and said faintly that, if she was not mistaken, it was the wife of a banker, who was called Lina, Linette, Lisette, Lia, anyhow something like that. I felt that \u2018wife of a banker\u2019 was inserted merely to put me off the scent. I decided to ask Albertine whether this were true. But I preferred to speak to her with an air of knowledge rather than of curiosity. Besides Albertine would not have answered me at all, or would have answered me only with a \u2018no\u2019 of which the \u2018n\u2019 would have been too hesitating and the \u2018o\u2019 too emphatic. Albertine never related facts that were capable of injuring her, but always other facts which could be explained only by them, the truth being rather a current which flows from what people say to us, and which we apprehend, invisible as it may be, than the actual thing that they say. And so when I assured her that a woman whom she had known at Vichy had a bad reputation, she swore to me that this woman was not at all what I supposed, and had never attempted to make her do anything improper. But she added, another day, when I was speaking of my curiosity as to people of that sort, that the Vichy lady had a friend, whom she, Albertine, did not know, but whom the lady had \u2018promised to introduce to her.\u2019 That she should have promised her this, could only mean that Albertine wished it, or that the lady had known that by offering the introduction she would be giving her pleasure. But if I had pointed this out to Albertine, I should have appeared to be depending for my information upon her, I should have put an end to it at once, I should never have learned anything more, I should have ceased to make myself feared. Besides, we were at Balbec, the Vichy lady and her friend lived at Menton; the remoteness, the impossibility of the danger made short work of my suspicions. Often when M. de Cambremer hailed me from the station I had been with Albertine making the most of the darkness, and with all the more difficulty as she had been inclined to resist, fearing that it was not dark enough. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sure Cottard saw us, anyhow, if he didn\u2019t, he must have noticed how breathless we were from our voices, just when they were talking about your other kind of breathlessness,\u201d Albertine said to me when we arrived at the Douville station where we were to take the little train home. But this homeward, like the outward journey, if, by giving me a certain poetical feeling, it awakened in me the desire to travel, to lead a new life, and so made me decide to abandon any intention of marrying Albertine, and even to break off our relations finally, also, and by the very fact of their contradictory nature, made this bleach more easy. For, on the homeward journey just as much as on the other, at every station there joined us in the train or greeted us from the platform people whom we knew; the furtive pleasures of the imagination were outweighed by those other, continual pleasures of sociability which are so soothing, so soporific. Already, before the stations themselves, their names (which had suggested so many fancies to me since the day on which I first heard them, the evening on which I travelled down to Balbec with my grandmother), had grown human, had lost their strangeness since the evening when Brichot, at Albertine\u2019s request, had given us a more complete account of their etymology. I had been charmed by the \u2018flower\u2019 that ended certain names, such as Fiquefleur, Ronfleur, Fiers, Barfleur, Harfleur, etc., and amused by the.\u2018beef that comes at the end of Bricqueboeuf. But the flower vanished, and also the beef, when Brichot (and this he had told me on the first day in the train) informed us that fleur means a harbour (like fiord), and thatboeuf, in Norman budh, means a hut. As he cited a number of examples, what had appeared to me a particular instance became general, Bricqueboeuf took its place by the side of Elbeuf, and indeed in a name that was at first sight as individual as the place itself, like the name Pennedepie, in which the obscurities most impossible for the mind to elucidate seemed to me to have been amalgamated from time immemorial in a word as coarse, savoury and hard as a certain Norman cheese, I was disappointed to find the Gallic pen which means mountain and is as recognisable in Pennemarck as in the Apennines. As at each halt of the train I felt that we should have friendly hands to shake if not visitors to receive in our carriage, I said to Albertine: \u201cHurry up and ask Brichot about the names you want to know. You mentioned to me Mar-couville l\u2019Orgueilleuse.\u201d \u201cYes, I love that orgueil, it\u2019s a proud village,\u201d said Albertine. \u201cYou would find it,\u201d Brichot replied, \u201cprouder still if, instead of turning it into French or even adopting a low Latinity, as we find in the Cartulary of the Bishop of Bayeux, Marcouvilla superba, you were to take the older form, more akin to the Norman, Marculplinvilla superba, the village, the domain of Merculph. In almost all these names which end in ville, you might see still marshalled upon this coast, the phantoms of the rude Norman invaders. At Hermenonville, you had, standing by the carriage door, only our excellent Doctor, who, obviously, has nothing of the Nordic chief about him. But, by shutting your eyes, ypu might have seen the illustrious H\u00e9rimund (Herimundivilla). Although I can never understand why people choose those roads, between Loigny and Balbec-Plage, rather than the very picturesque roads that lead from Loigny to Old Balbec, Mme. Verdurin has perhaps taken you out that way in her carriage. If so, you have seen Incarville, or the village of Wiscar; and Tourville, before you come to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, is the village of Turold. And besides, there were not only the Normans. It seems that the Germans (Alemanni) came as far as here: Aumenancourt, Alemanicurtis \u2014 don\u2019t let us speak of it to that young officer I see there; he would be capable of refusing to visit his cousins there any more. There were also Saxons, as is proved by the springs of Sissonne\u201d (the goal of one of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s favourite excursions, and quite rightly), \u201cjust as in England you have Middlesex, Wessex. And what is inexplicable, it seems that the Goths, miserable wretches as they are said to have been, came as far as this, and even the Moors, for Mortagne comes from Mauretania. Their trace has remained at Gourville \u2014 Gothorunvilla. Some vestige of the Latins subsists also, Lagny (Latiniacum).\u201d \u201cWhat I should like to have is an explanation of Thorpehomme,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cI understand homme,\u201d he added, at which the sculptor and Cottard exchanged significant glances. \u201cBut Thorpe?\u201d \u201cHomme does not in the least mean what you are naturally led to suppose, Baron,\u201d replied Brichot, glancing maliciously at Cottard and the sculptor. \u201cHomme has nothing to do, in this instance, with the sex to which I am not indebted for my mother.Homme is holm which means a small island, etc. . . . As for Thorpe, or village, we find that in a hundred words with which I have already bored our young friend. Thus in Thorpehomme there is not the name of a Norman chief, but words of the Norman language. You see how the whole of this country has been Germanised.\u201d \u201cI think that is an exaggeration,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cYesterday I was at Orgeville.\u201d \u201cThis time I give you back the man I took from you in Thorpehomme, Baron. Without wishing to be pedantic, a Charter of Robert I gives us, for Orgeville, Otgervilla, the domain of Otger. All these names are those of ancient lords. Octeville la Venelle is a corruption of l\u2019Avenel. The Avenels were a family of repute in the middle ages. Bour-guenolles, where Mme. Verdurin took us the other day, used to be written Bourg de M\u00f4les, for that village belonged in the eleventh century to Baudoin de M\u00f4les, as also did la Chaise-Baudoin, but here we are at Donci\u00e8res.\u201d \u201cHeavens, look at all these subalterns trying to get in,\u201d said M. de Charlus with feigned alarm. \u201cI am thinking of you, for it doesn\u2019t affect me, I am getting out here.\u201d \u201cYou hear, Doctor?\u201d said Brichot. \u201cThe Baron is afraid of officers passing over his body. And yet they have every right to appear here in their strength, for Donci\u00e8res is precisely the same as Saint-Cyr, Dominus Cyriacus. There are plenty of names of towns in which Sanctus and Sancta are replaced by Dominus and Domina. Besides, this peaceful military town has sometimes a false air of Saint-Cyr, of Versailles, and even of Fontainebleau.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During these homeward (as on the outward) journeys I used to tell Albertine to put on her things, for I knew very well that at Aumenancourt, Donci\u00e8res, Epreville, Saint-Vast we should be receiving brief visits from friends. Nor did I at all object to these, when they took the form of (at Hermenonville \u2014 the domain of Herimund) a visit from M. de Chevregny, seizing the opportunity, when he had come down to meet other guests, of asking me to come over to luncheon next day at Beausoleil, or (at Donci\u00e8res) the sudden irruption of one of Saint-Loup\u2019s charming friends sent by him (if he himself was not free) to convey to me an invitation from Captain de Borodino, from the officers\u2019 mess at the Cocq-Hardi, or the serjeants\u2019 at the Faisan Dor\u00e9. If Saint-Loup often came in person, during the whole of the time that he was stationed there, I contrived, without attracting attention, to keep Albertine a prisoner under my own watch and ward, not that my vigilance was of any use. On one occasion however my watch was interrupted. When there was a long stop, Bloch, after greeting us, was making off at once to join his father, who, having just succeeded to his uncle\u2019s fortune, and having leased a country house by the name of La Commanderie, thought it befitting a country gentleman always to go about in a post chaise, with postilions in livery. Bloch begged me to accompany him to the carriage. \u201cBut make haste, for these quadrupeds are impatient, come, O man beloved of the gods, thou wilt give pleasure to my father.\u201d But I could not bear to leave Albertine in the train with Saint-Loup; they might, while my back was turned, get into conversation, go into another compartment, smile at one another, touch one another; my eyes, glued to Albertine, could not detach themselves from her so long as Saint-Loup was there. Now I could see quite well that Bloch, who had asked me, as a favour, to go and say how d\u2019ye do to his father, in the first place thought it not very polite of me to refuse when there was nothing to prevent me from doing so, the porters having told us that the train would remain for at least a quarter of an hour in the station, and almost all the passengers, without whom it would not start, having alighted; and, what was more, had not the least doubt that it was because quite decidedly \u2014 my conduct on this occasion furnished him with a definite proof of it \u2014 I was a snob. For he was well aware of the names of the people in whose company I was. In fact M. de Charlus had said to me, some time before this and without remembering or caring that the introduction had been made long ago: \u201cBut you must introduce your friend to me, you are shewing a want of respect for myself,\u201d and had talked to Bloch, who had seemed to please him immensely, so much so that he had gratified him with an: \u201cI hope to meet you again.\u201d \u201cThen it is irrevocable, you won\u2019t walk a hundred yards to say how d\u2019ye do to my father, who would be so pleased,\u201d Bloch said to me. I was sorry to appear to be wanting in good fellowship, and even more so for the reason for which Bloch supposed that I was wanting, and to feel that he imagined that I was not the same towards my middle class friends when I was with people of \u2018birth.\u2019 From that day he ceased to shew me the same friendly spirit and, what pained me more, had no longer the same regard for my character. But, in order to undeceive him as to the motive which made me remain in the carriage, I should have had to tell him something \u2014 to wit, that I was jealous of Albertine \u2014 which would have distressed me even more than letting him suppose that I was stupidly worldly. So it is that in theory we find that we ought always to explain ourselves frankly, to avoid misunderstandings. But very often life arranges these in such a way that, in order to dispel them, in the rare circumstances in which it might be possible to do so, we must reveal either \u2014 which was not the case here \u2014 something that would annoy our friend even more than the injustice that he imputes to us, or a secret the disclosure of which \u2014 and this was my predicament \u2014 appears to us even worse than the misunderstanding. Besides, even without my explaining to Bloch, since I could not, my reason for not going with him, if I had begged him not to be angry with me, I should only have increased his anger by shewing him that I had observed it. There was nothing to be done but to bow before the decree of fate which had willed that Albertine\u2019s presence should prevent me from accompanying him, and that he should suppose that it was on the contrary the presence of people of distinction, the only effect of which, had they been a hundred times more distinguished, would have been to make me devote my attention exclusively to Bloch and reserve all my civility for him. It is sufficient that accidentally, absurdly, an incident (in this case the juxtaposition of Albertine and Saint-Loup) be interposed between two destinies whose lines have been converging towards one another, for them to deviate, stretch farther and farther apart, and never converge again. And there are friendships more precious than Bloch\u2019s for myself which have been destroyed without the involuntary author of the offence having any opportunity to explain to the offended party what would no doubt have healed the injury to his self-esteem and called back his fugitive affection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Friendships more precious than Bloch\u2019s is not, for that matter, saying very much. He had all the faults that most annoyed me. It so happened that my affection for Albertine made them altogether intolerable. Thus in that brief moment in which I was talking to him, while keeping my eye on Robert, Bloch told me that he had been to luncheon with Mme. Bontemps and that everybody had spoken about me with the warmest praise until the \u2018decline of Helios.\u2019 \u201cGood,\u201d thought I, \u201cas Mme. Bontemps regards Bloch as a genius, the enthusiastic support that he must have given me will do more than anything that the others can have said, it will come round to Albertine. Any day now she is bound to learn, and I am surprised that her aunt has not repeated it to her already, that I am a \u2018superior person.\u2019\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Bloch went on, \u201ceverybody sang your praises. I alone preserved a silence as profound as though I had absorbed, in place of the repast (poor, as it happened) that was set before us, poppies, dear to the blessed brother of Thanatos and Lethe, the divine Hypnos, who enwraps in pleasant bonds the body and the tongue. It is not that I admire you less than the band of hungry dogs with whom I had been bidden to feed. But I admire you because I understand you, and they admire you without understanding you. To tell the truth, I admire you too much to speak of you thus in public, it would have seemed to me a profanation to praise aloud what I carry in the profoundest depths of my heart. In vain might they question me about you, a sacred Pudor, daughter of Kronion, made me remain mute.\u201d I had not the bad taste to appear annoyed, but this Pudor seemed to me akin \u2014 far more than to Kronion \u2014 to the modesty that prevents a critic who admires you from speaking of you because the secret temple in which you sit enthroned would be invaded by the mob of ignorant readers and journalists \u2014 to the modesty of the statesman who does not recommend you for a decoration because you would be lost in a crowd of people who are not your equals, to the modesty of the academician who refrains from voting for you in order to spare you the shame of being the colleague of X\u2014\u2014-who is devoid of talent, to the modesty in short, more respectable and at the same time more criminal, of the sons who implore us not to write about their dead father who abounded in merit, so that we shall not prolong his life and create a halo of glory round the poor deceased who would prefer that his name should be borne upon the lips of men to the wreaths, albeit laid there by pious hands, upon his tomb\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Bloch, while he distressed me by his inability to understand the reason that prevented me from going to speak to his father, had exasperated me by confessing that he had depreciated me at Mme. Bontemps\u2019s (I now understood why Albertine had never made any allusion to this luncheon-party and remained silent when I spoke to her of Bloch\u2019s affection for myself), the young Israelite had produced upon M. de Charlus an impression that was quite the opposite of annoyance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly Bloch now believed not only that I was unable to remain for a second out of the company of smart people, but that, jealous of the advances that they might make to him (M. de Charlus, for instance), I was trying to put a spoke in his wheel and to prevent him from making friends with them; but for his part the Baron regretted that he had not seen more of my friend. As was his habit, he took care not to betray this feeling. He began by asking me various questions about Bloch, but in so casual a tone, with an interest that seemed so assumed, that one would have thought he did not hear the answers. With an air of detachment, an intonation that expressed not merely indifference but complete distraction, and as though simply out of politeness to myself: \u201cHe looks intelligent, he said he wrote, has he any talent?\u201d I told M. de Charlus that it had been very kind of him to say that he hoped to see Bloch again. The Baron made not the slightest sign of having heard my remark, and as I repeated it four times without eliciting a reply, I began to wonder whether I had not been the dupe of an acoustic mirage when I thought I heard M. de Charlus utter those words. \u201cHe lives at Balbec?\u201d intoned the Baron, with an air so far from questioning that it is a nuisance that the written language does not possess a sign other than the mark of interrogation with which to end these speeches which are apparently so little interrogative. It is true that such a sign would scarcely serve for M. de Charlus. \u201cNo, they have taken a place near here, La Commanderie.\u201d Having learned what he wished to know, M. de Charlus pretended to feel a contempt for Bloch. \u201cHow appalling,\u201d he exclaimed, his voice resuming all its clarion strength. \u201cAll the places or properties called La Commanderie were built or owned by the Knights of the Order of Malta (of whom I am one), as the places called Temple or Cavalerie were by the Templars. That I should live at La Commanderie would be the most natural thing in the world. But a Jew! However, I am not surprised; it comes from a curious instinct for sacrilege, peculiar to that race. As soon as a Jew has enough money to buy a place in the country he always chooses one that is called Priory, Abbey, Minster, Chantry. I had some business once with a Jewish official, guess where he lived: at Pont-l\u2019Ev\u00eaque. When he came to grief, he had himself transferred to Brittany, to Pont-l\u2019Abb\u00e9. When they perform in Holy Week those indecent spectacles that are called \u2018the Passion,\u2019 half the audience are Jews, exulting in the thought that they are going to hang Christ a second time on the Cross, at least in effigy. At one of the Lamoureux concerts, I had a wealthy Jewish banker sitting next to me. They played the Boyhood of Christ by Berlioz, he was quite shocked. But he soon recovered his habitually blissful expression when he heard the Good Friday music. So your friend lives at the Commanderie, the wretch! What sadism! You shall shew me the way to it,\u201d he went on, resuming his air of indifference, \u201cso that I may go there one day and see how our former domains endure such a profanation. It is unfortunate, for he has good manners, he seems to have been well brought up. The next thing I shall hear will be that his address in Paris is Rue du Temple!\u201d M. de Charlus gave the impression, by these words, that he was seeking merely to find a fresh example in support of his theory; as a matter of fact he was aiming at two birds with one stone, his principal object being to find out Bloch\u2019s address. \u201cYou are quite right,\u201d put in Brichot, \u201cthe Rue du Temple used to be called Rue de la Chevalerie-du-Temple. And in that connexion will you allow me to make a remark, Baron?\u201d said the don. \u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d said M. de Charlus tartly, the proffered remark preventing him from obtaining his information. \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d replied Brichot in alarm. \u201cIt is with regard to the etymology of Balbec, about which they were asking me. The Rue du Temple was formerly known as the Rue Barre-du-Bac, because the Abbey of Bac in Normandy had its Bar of Justice there in Paris.\u201d M. de Charlus made no reply and looked as if he had not heard, which was one of his favourite forms of insolence. \u201cWhere does your friend live, in Paris? As three streets out of four take their name from a church or an abbey, there seems every chance of further sacrilege there. One can\u2019t prevent Jews from living in the Boulevard de la Madeleine, Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 or Place Saint-Augustin. So long as they do not carry their perfidy a stage farther, and pitch their tents in the Place du Parvis Notre-Dame, Quai de l\u2019Archev\u00each\u00e9, Rue Chanoinesse or Rue de l\u2019Avemaria, we must make allowance for their difficulties.\u201d We could not enlighten M. de Charlus, not being aware of Bloch\u2019s address at the time. But I knew that his father\u2019s office was in the Rue des Blancs-Manteaux. \u201cOh! Is not that the last word in perversity?\u201d exclaimed M. de Charlus, who appeared to find a profound satisfaction in his own cry of ironical indignation. \u201cRue des Blancs-Manteaux!\u201d he repeated, dwelling with emphasis upon each syllable and laughing as he spoke. \u201cWhat sacrilege! Imagine that these White Mantles polluted by M. Bloch were those of the mendicant brethren, styled Serfs of the Blessed Virgin, whom Saint Louis established there. And the street has always housed some religious Order. The profanation is all the more diabolical since within a stone\u2019s throw of the Rue des Blancs-Manteaux there is a street whose name escapes me, which is entirely conceded to the Jews, there are Hebrew characters over the shops, bakeries for unleavened bread, kosher butcheries, it is positively the Judengasse of Paris. That is where M. Bloch ought to reside. Of course,\u201d he went on in an emphatic, arrogant tone, suited to the discussion of aesthetic matters, and giving, by an unconscious strain of heredity, the air of an old musketeer of Louis XIII to his backward-tilted face, \u201cI take an interest in all that sort of thing only from the point of view of art. Politics are not in my line, and I cannot condemn wholesale, because Bloch belongs to it, a nation that numbers Spinoza among its illustrious sons. And I admire Rembrandt too much not to realise the beauty that can be derived from frequenting the synagogue. But after all a ghetto is all the finer, the more homogeneous and complete it is. You may be sure, moreover, so far are business instincts and avarice mingled in that race with sadism, that the proximity of the Hebraic street of which I was telling you, the convenience of having close at hand the fleshpots of Israel will have made your friend choose the Rue des Blancs-Manteaux. How curious it all is! It was there, by the way, that there lived a strange Jew who used to boil the Host, after which I think they boiled him, which is stranger still, since it seems to suggest that the body of a Jew can be equivalent to the Body of Our Lord. Perhaps it might be possible to arrange with your friend to take us to see the church of the White Mantles. Just think that it was there that they laid the body of Louis d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans after his assassination by Jean sans Peur, which unfortunately did not rid us of the Orl\u00e9ans. Personally, I have always been on the best of terms with my cousin the Duc de Chartres; still, after all, they are a race of usurpers who caused the assassination of Louis XVI and dethroned Charles X and Henri V. One can see where they get that from, when their ancestors include Monsieur, who was so styled doubtless because he was the most astounding old woman, and the Regent and the rest of them. What a family!\u201d This speech, anti-Jew or pro-Hebrew \u2014 according as one regards the outward meaning of its phrases or the intentions that they concealed \u2014 had been comically interrupted for me by a remark which Morel whispered to me, to the fury of M. de Charlus. Morel, who had not failed to notice the impression that Bloch had made, murmured his thanks in my ear for having \u2018given him the push,\u2019 adding cynically: \u201cHe wanted to stay, it\u2019s all jealousy, he would like to take my place. Just like a yid!\u201d \u201cWe might have taken advantage of this halt, which still continues, to ask your friend for some explanations of his ritual. Couldn\u2019t you fetch him back?\u201d M. de Charlus asked me, with the anxiety of uncertainty. \u201cNo, it\u2019s impossible, he has gone away in a carriage, and besides, he is vexed with me.\u201d \u201cThank you, thank you,\u201d Morel breathed. \u201cYour excuse is preposterous, one can always overtake a carriage, there is nothing to prevent your taking a motor-car,\u201d replied M. de Charlus, in the tone of a man accustomed to see everyone yield before him. But, observing my silence: \u201cWhat is this more or less imaginary carriage?\u201d he said to me insolently, and with a last ray of hope. \u201cIt is an open post chaise which must by this time have reached La Commanderie.\u201d Before the impossible, M. de Charlus resigned himself and made a show of jocularity. \u201cI can understand their recoiling from the idea of a new brougham. It might have swept them clean.\u201d At last we were warned that the train was about to start, and Saint-Loup left us. But this was the only day when by getting into our carriage he, unconsciously, caused me pain, when I thought for a moment of leaving him with Albertine in order to go with Bloch. The other times his presence did not torment me. For of her own accord Albertine, to save me from any uneasiness, would upon some pretext or other place herself in such, a position that she could not even unintentionally brush against Robert, almost too far away to have to hold out her hand to him, and turning her eyes away from him would plunge, as soon as he appeared, into ostentatious and almost affected conversation with any of the other passengers, continuing this make-believe until Saint-Loup had gone. So that the visits which he paid us at Donci\u00e8res, causing me no pain, no inconvenience even, were in no way discordant from the rest, all of which I found pleasing because they brought me so to speak the homage and invitation of this land. Already, as the summer drew to a close, on our journey from Balbec to Douville, when I saw in the distance the watering-place at Saint-Pierre des Ifs where, for a moment in the evening, the crest of the cliffs glittered rosy pink as the snow upon a mountain glows at sunset, it no longer recalled to my mind, I do not say the melancholy which the sight of its strange, sudden elevation had aroused in me on the first evening, when it filled me with such a longing to take the train back to Paris instead of going on to Balbec, but the spectacle that in the morning, Elstir had told me, might be enjoyed from there, at the hour before sunrise, when all the colours of the rainbow are refracted from the rocks, and when he had so often wakened the little boy who had served him, one year, as model, to paint him, nude, upon the sands. The name Saint-Pierre des Ifs announced to me merely that there would presently appear a strange, intelligent, painted man of fifty with whom I should be able to talk about Chateaubriand and Balzac. And now in the mists of evening, behind that cliff of Incarville, which had filled my mind with so many dreams in the past, what I saw, as though its old sandstone wall had become transparent, was the comfortable house of an uncle of M. de Cambremer in which I knew that I should always find a warm welcome if I did not wish to dine at la Raspeli\u00e8re or to return to Balbec. So that it was not merely the place-names of this district that had lost their initial mystery, but the places themselves. The names, already half-stripped of a mystery which etymology had replaced by reason, had now come down a stage farther still. On our homeward journeys, at Hermenonville, at Incarville, at Harambouville, as the train came to a standstill, we could make out shadowy forms which we did not at first identify, and which Brichot, who could see nothing at all, might perhaps have mistaken in the darkness for the phantoms of Herimund, Wiscar and Herimbald. But they came up to our carriage. It was merely M. de Cambremer, now completely out of touch with the Verdurins, who had come to see off his own guests and, as ambassador for his wife and mother, came to ask me whether I would not let him \u2018carry me off\u2019 to keep me for a few days at F\u00e9terne where I should find successively a lady of great musical talent, who would sing me the whole of Gluck, and a famous chess-player, with whom I could have some splendid games, which would not interfere with the fishing expeditions and yachting trips on the bay, nor even with the Verdurin dinner-parties, for which the Marquis gave me his word of honour that he would \u2018lend\u2019 me, sending me there and fetching me back again, for my greater convenience and also to make sure of my returning. \u201cBut I cannot believe that it is good for you to go so high up. I know my sister could never stand it. She would come back in a fine state! She is not at all well just now. Indeed, you have been as bad as that! To-morrow you won\u2019t be able to stand up!\u201d And he shook with laughter, not from malevolence but for the same reason which made him laugh whenever he saw a lame man hobbling along the street, or had to talk to a deaf person. \u201cAnd before this? What, you haven\u2019t had an attack for a fortnight. Do you know, that is simply marvellous. Really, you ought to come and stay at F\u00e9terne, you could talk about your attacks to my sister.\u201d At Incarville it was the Marquis de Montpeyroux who, not having been able to go to F\u00e9terne, for he had been away shooting, had come \u2018to meet the train\u2019 in top boots, with a pheasant\u2019s feather in his hat, to shake hands with the departing guests and at the same time with myself, bidding me expect, on the day of the week that would be most convenient to me, a visit from his son, whom he thanked me for inviting, adding that he would be very glad if I would make the boy read a little; or else M. de Cr\u00e9cy, come out to digest his dinner, he explained, smoking his pipe, accepting a cigar or indeed more than one, and saying to me: \u201cWell, you haven\u2019t named a day for our next Lucullus evening? We have nothing to discuss? Allow me to remind you that we left unsettled the question of the two families of Montgomery. We really must settle it. I am relying upon you.\u201d Others had come simply to buy newspapers. And many others came and chatted with us who, I have often suspected, were to be found upon the platform of the station nearest to their little mansion simply because they had nothing better to do than to converse for a moment with people of their acquaintance. A scene of social existence like any other, in fact, these halts on the little railway. The train itself appeared conscious of the part that had devolved upon it, had contracted a sort of human kindliness; patient, of a docile nature, it waited as long as they pleased for the stragglers, and even after it had started would stop to pick up those who signalled to it; they would then run after it panting, in which they resembled itself, but differed from it in that they were running to overtake it at full speed whereas it employed only a wise slowness. And so Hermenonville, Harambouville, Incarville no longer suggested to me even the rugged grandeurs of the Norman Conquest, not content with having entirely rid themselves of the unaccountable melancholy in which I had seen them steeped long ago in the moist evening air. Donci\u00e8res! To me, even after I had come to know it and had awakened from my dream, how much had long survived in that name of pleasantly glacial streets, lighted windows, succulent flesh of birds. Donci\u00e8res! Now it was nothing more than the station at which Morel joined the train, Egleville (Aquilae villa) that at which we generally found waiting for us Princess Sherbatoff, Maineville, the station at which Albertine left the train on fine evenings, when, if she was not too tired, she felt inclined to enjoy a moment more of my company, having, if she took a footpath, little if any farther to walk than if she had alighted at Parville (Paterni villa). Not only did I no longer feel the anxious dread of isolation which had gripped my heart the first evening, I had no longer any need to fear its reawakening, nor to feel myself a stranger or alone in this land productive not only of chestnut trees and tamarisks, but of friendships which from beginning to end of the journey formed a long chain, interrupted like that of the blue hills, hidden here and there in the anfractuosity of the rock or behind the lime trees of the avenue, but delegating at each stage an amiable gentleman who came to interrupt my course with a cordial handclasp, to prevent me from feeling it too long, to offer if need be to continue the journey with me. Another would be at the next station, so that the whistle of the little tram parted us from one friend only to enable us to meet others. Between the most isolated properties and the railway which skirted them almost at the pace of a person who is walking fast, the distance was so slight that at the moment when, from the platform, outside the waiting-room, their owners hailed us, we might almost have imagined that they were doing so from their own doorstep, from their bedroom window, as though the little departmental line had been merely a street in a country town and the isolated mansion-house the town residence of a family; and even at the few stations where no \u2018good evening\u2019 sounded, the silence had a nourishing and calming fulness, because I knew that it was formed from the slumber of friends who had gone to bed early in the neighbouring manor, where my arrival would have been greeted with joy if I had been obliged to arouse them to ask for some hospitable office. Not to mention that a sense of familiarity so fills up our time that we have not, after a few months, a free moment in a town where on our first arrival the day offered us the absolute disposal of all its twelve hours, if one of these had by any chance fallen vacant, it would no longer have occurred to me to devote it to visiting some church for the sake of which I had come to Bal-bec in the past, nor even to compare a scene painted by Elstir with the sketch that I had seen of it in his studio, but rather to go and play one more game of chess at M. F\u00e9r\u00e9\u2018s. It was indeed the degrading influence, as it was also the charm that this country round Balbec had had, that it should become for me in the true sense a friendly country; if its territorial distribution, its sowing, along the whole extent of the coast, with different forms of cultivation, gave of necessity to the visits which I paid to these different friends the form of a journey, they also reduced that journey to nothing more than the social amusement of a series of visits. The same place-names, so disturbing to me in the past that the mere Country House Year Book, when I turned over the chapter devoted to the Department of the Manche, caused me as keen an emotion as the railway time-table, had become so familiar to me that, in the time-table itself, I could have consulted the page headed: Balbec to Douville via Donci\u00e8res, with the same happy tranquillity as a directory of addresses. In. this too social valley, along the sides of which I felt assembled, whether visible or not, a numerous company of friends, the poetical cry of the evening was no longer that of the owl or frog, but the \u2018How goes it?\u2019 of M. de Criquetot or the \u2018Chaire!\u2019 of Brichot. Its atmosphere no longer aroused my anguish, and, charged with effluvia that were purely human, was easily breathable, indeed unduly soothing. The benefit that I did at least derive from it was that of looking at things only from a practical point of view. The idea of marrying Albertine appeared to me to be madnessEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1770661", "artist_names": "Eddie Floyd", "full_title": "Love Is A

Burton", "lyrics": "Arabian Nights, Vol. 5 (Chap. 55) LyricsAbu Al-Husn And His Slave-Girl Tawaddud.[FN#281]\n\nThere was once in Baghdad a man of consequence and rich in monies and immoveables, who was one of the chiefs of the merchants; and Allah had largely endowed him with worldly goods, but had not vouchsafed him what he longed for of offspring; and there passed over him a long space of time, without his being blessed with issue, male or female. His years waxed great; his bones became wasted and his back bent; weakness and weariness grew upon him, and he feared the loss of his wealth and possessions, seeing he had no child whom he might make his heir and by whom his name should be remembered. So he betook himself with supplication to Almighty Allah, fasting by day and praying through the night. Moreover, he vowed many vows to the Living, the Eternal; and visited the pious and was constant in supplication to the Most Highest, till He gave ear to him and accepted his prayer and took pity on his straining and complaining; so that, before many days were past, he knew carnally one of his women and she conceived by him the same night. In due time she finished her months and, casting her burden, bore a male child as he were a slice of the moon; whereupon the merchant fulfilled his vows in his gratitude to Allah, (to whom be honour and glory!) and gave alms and clothed the widow and the orphan. On the seventh night after the boy's birth, he named him Abu al-Husn,[FN#282] and the wet-nurses suckled him and the dry-nurses dandled him and the servants and the slaves carried him and handled him, till he shot up and grew tall and throve greatly and learnt the Sublime Koran and the ordinances of Al-Islam and the Canons of the True Faith; and calligraphy and poetry and mathematics and archery. On this wise he became the union-pearl of his age and the goodliest of the folk of his time and his day; fair of face and of tongue fluent, carrying himself with a light and graceful gait and glorying in his stature proportionate and amorous graces which were to many a bait: and his cheeks were red and flower-white was his forehead and his side face waxed brown with tender down, even as saith one, describing him,\n\n\"The spring of the down on cheeks right clearly shows: * And how\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     when the Spring is gone shall last the rose?\nDost thou not see that the growth upon his cheek * Is violet-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     bloom that from its leaves outgrows.\"\n\nHe abode awhile in ease and happiness with his father, who rejoiced and delighted in him, till he came to man's estate, when the merchant one day made him sit down before him and said, \"O my son, the appointed term draweth near; my hour of death is at hand and it remaineth but to meet Allah (to whom belong Majesty and Might!). I leave thee what shall suffice thee, even to thy son's son, of monies and mansions, farms and gardens; wherefore, fear thou Almighty Allah, O my son, in dealing with that which I bequeath to thee and follow none but those who will help thee to the Divine favour.\" Not long after, he sickened and died; so his son ordered his funeral,[FN#283] after the goodliest wise, and burying him, returned to his house and sat mourning for him many days and nights. But behold, certain of his friends came in to him and said to him, \"Whoso leaveth a son like thee is not dead; indeed, what is past is past and fled and mourning beseemeth none but the young maid and the wife cloistered.\" And they ceased not from him till they wrought on him to enter the Hammam and break off his mourning.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Thirty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Abu al-Husn was visited by his friends and taken to the Hamman and persuaded to break off his mourning, he presently forgot his father's charge, and his head was turned by his riches; he thought fortune would always wone with him as it was, and that wealth would ever wax and never wane. So he ate and drank and made merry and took his pleasure and gave gifts of gear and coin and was profuse with gold and addrest himself up to eating fowls and breaking the seals of wine-flasks and listening to the giggle of the daughter of the vine, as she gurgled from the flagon and enjoying the jingle of the singing-girls; nor did he give over this way of life, till his wealth was wasted and the case worsened and all his goods went from him and he bit his hands[FN#284] in bitter penitence. For of a truth he had nothing left, after that which he had squandered, but a concubine, a slave-girl whom his father had bequeathed to him with the rest of his estate: and she had no equal in beauty and loveliness and brightness and liveliness and symmetric stature and perfect grace. She was past mistress in every manner of arts and accomplishments and endowed with many excellences, surpassing all the folk of her age and time. She was grown more notorious than a way-mark,[FN#285] for her seductive genius, and outdid the fair both in theory and practice, and she was noted for her swimming gait, flexile and delicate, albeit she was full five feet in height and by all the boons of fortune deckt and dight, with strait arched brows twain, as they were the crescent moon of Sha'ab\u00e1n,[FN#286] and eyes like gazelles' eyne; and nose like the edge of scymitar fine and cheeks like anemones of blood-red shine; and mouth like Solomon's seal and sign and teeth like necklaces of pearls in line; and navel holding an ounce of oil of benzoin and waist more slender than his body whom love hath wasted and whom concealment hath made sick with pine and hind parts heavier than two hills of sand; briefly she was a volume of charms after his saying who saith,\n\n\"Her fair shape ravisheth, if face to face she did appear, * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     if she turn, for severance from her she slayeth sheer.\nSun-like, full-moon-like, sapling-like, unto her character *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    Estrangement no wise appertains nor cruelty austere.\nUnder the bosom of her shift the garths of Eden are * And the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     full-moon revolveth still upon her neck-rings'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     sphere.\"[FN#287]\n\nShe seemed a full moon rising and a gazelle browsing, a girl of nine plus five[FN#288] shaming the moon and sun, even as saith of her the sayer eloquent and ingenious,\n\n\"Semblance of full-moon Heaven bore, * When five and five are\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     conjoined by four;\n'Tis not my sin if she made of me * Its like when it riseth\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    horizon o'er.\"[FN#289]\n\nClean of skin, odoriferous of breath, it seemed as if she were of fire fashioned and of crystal moulded; rose-red was the cheek of her and perfect the shape and form of her; even as one saith of her, describing her,\n\n\"Scented with sandal[FN#290] and musk, right proudly doth she go,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     * With gold and silver and rose and saffron-colour aglow.\nA flower in a garden she is, a pearl in an ouch of gold * Or an\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    image in chapel[FN#291] set for worship of high and low.\nSlender and shapely she is; vivacity bids her arise, * But the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     weight of her hips says, 'Sit, or softly and slowly go.'\nWhenas her favours I seek and sue for my heart's desire, * 'Be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     gracious,' her beauty says; but her coquetry answers, 'No.'\nGlory to Him who made beauty her portion, and that * Of her lover\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     to be the prate of the censurers, heigho!\"[FN#292]\nShe captivated all who saw her, with the excellence of her beauty and the sweetness of her smile,[FN#293] and shot them down with the shafts she launched from her eyes; and withal she was eloquent of speech and excellently skilled in verse. Now when Abu al-Husn had squandered all his gold, and his ill-plight all could behold, and there remained to him naught save this slave-girl, he abode three days without tasting meat or taking rest in sleep, and the handmaid said to him, \"O my lord, carry me to the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Thirty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the slave-girl to her master, \"O my lord, carry me to Harun al-Rashid, fifth of the sons of Abbas, and seek of him to my price ten thousand dinars. If he deem me dear, say to him: 'O Prince of True Believers, my handmaid is worth more than this: do but prove her, and her value will be magnified in thine eyes; for this slave-girl hath not her equal, and she were unfit to any but thou.'\" And she added, \"Beware, O my lord, of selling me at less than the sum I have named; indeed 'tis but little for the like of me.\" Now her owner knew not her worth nor that she had no equal in her day; but he carried her to the Caliph and set her in the presence and repeated what she had bidden him say. The Caliph asked her, \"What is thy name?\"; to which she answered, \"My name is Tawaddud.\"[FN#294] He then enquired, \"O Tawaddud, in what branches of knowledge dost thou excel?\"; and she replied, \"O my lord, I am versed in syntax and poetry and jurisprudence and exegesis and philosophy; and I am skilled in music and the knowledge of the Divine ordinances and in arithmetic and geodesy and geometry and the fables of the ancients. I know the Sublime Koran by heart and have read it according to the seven, the ten and the fourteen modes. I know the number of its chapters and versets and sections and words; and its halves and fourths and eighths and tenths; the number of prostrations which occur in it and the sum total of its letters; and I know what there is in it of abrogating and abrogated[FN#295]; also what parts of it were revealed at Al-Medinah and what at Meccah and the cause of the different revelations. I know the Holy Traditions of the Apostle's sayings, historical and legendary, the established and those whose ascription is doubtful; and I have studied the exact sciences, geometry and philosophy and medicine and logic and rhetoric and composition; and I have learnt many things by rote and am passionately fond of poetry. I can play the lute and know its gamut and notes and notation and the crescendo and diminuendo. If I sing and dance, I seduce, and if I dress and scent myself, I slay. In fine, I have reached a pitch of perfection such as can be estimated only by those of them who are firmly rooted in knowledge.\"[FN#296] Now when the Caliph heard these words spoken by one so young, he wondered at her eloquence, and turning to Abu al-Husn, said, \"I will summon those who shall discuss with her all she claimeth to know; if she answer correctly, I will give thee the price thou askest for her and more; and if not, thou art fitter to have her than I.\" \"With gladness and goodly gree, O Commander of the Faithful,\" replied Abu al-Husn. So the Caliph wrote to the Viceroy of Bassorah, to send him Ibrahim bin Siyy\u00e1r the prosodist, who was the first man of his day in argument and eloquence and poetry and logic, and bade him bring with him readers of the Koran and learned doctors of the law and physicians and astrologers and scientists and mathematicians and philosophers; and Ibrahim was more learned than all. In a little while they arrived at the palace of the Caliphate, knowing not what was to do, and the Caliph sent for them to his sitting-chamber and ordered them to be seated. So they sat down and he bade bring the damsel Tawaddud who came and unveiling, showed herself, as she were a sparkling star.[FN#297] The Caliph set her a stool of gold; and she saluted, and speaking with an eloquent tongue, said, \"O Commander of the Faithful, bid the Olema and the doctors of law and leaches and astrologers and scientists and mathematicians and all here present contend with me in argument.\" So he said to them, \"I desire of you that ye dispute with this damsel on the things of her faith, and stultify her argument in all she advanceth;\" and they answered, saying, \"We hear and we obey Allah and thee, O Commander of the Faithful.\" Upon this Tawaddud bowed her head and said, \"Which of you is the doctor of the law, the scholar, versed in the readings of the Koran and in the Traditions?\" Quoth one of them, \"I am the man thou seekest.\" Quoth she, \"Then ask me of what thou wilt.\" Said the doctor, \"Hast thou read the precious book of Allah and dost thou know its cancelling and cancelled parts and hast thou meditated its versets and its letters?\" \"Yes,\" answered she. \"Then,\" said he, \"I will proceed to question thee of the obligations and the immutable ordinances: so tell me of these, O damsel, and who is thy Lord, who thy prophet, who thy Guide, what is thy point of fronting in prayer, and who be thy brethren? Also what thy spiritual path and what thy highway?\" Whereto she replied, \"Allah is my Lord, and Mohammed (whom Allah save and assain!) my prophet, and the Koran is my guide and the Ka'abah my fronting; and the True-believers are my brethren. The practice of good is my path and the Sunnah my highway.\" The Caliph again marvelled at her words so eloquently spoken by one so young; and the doctor pursued, \"O damsel, with what do we know Almighty Allah?\" Said she, \"With the understanding.\" Said he, \"And what is the understanding?\" Quoth she, \"It is of two kinds, natural and acquired.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Thirty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damsel continued, \"The understanding is of two kinds, natural and acquired. The natural is that which Allah (to whom be honour and glory!) created for the right direction of His servants after His will; and the acquired is that which men accomplish by dint of study and fair knowledge.\" He rejoined, \"Thou hast answered well.\" Q \"Where is the seat of the understanding?\"\u2014\"Allah casteth it in the heart whence its lustrous beams ascend to the brain and there become fixed.\" Q \"How knowest thou the Prophet of Allah?\" \"By the reading of Allah's Holy Book and by signs and proofs and portents and miracles!\" Q \"What are the obligations and the immutable ordinances?\" \"The obligations are five. (1) Testification that there is no il\u00e1h[FN#298] but Allah, no god but the God alone and One, which for partner hath none, and that Mohammed is His servant and His apostle. (2) The standing in prayers.[FN#299] (3) The payment of the poor-rate. (4) Fasting Ramazan. (5) The Pilgrimage to Allah's Holy House for all to whom the journey is possible. The immutable ordinances are four; to wit, night and day and sun and moon, the which build up life and hope; nor any son of Adam wotteth if they will be destroyed on the Day of Judgment.\" Q \"What are the obligatory observances of the Faith?\" \"They are five, prayer, almsgiving, fasting, pilgrimage, fighting for the Faith and abstinence from the forbidden.\" Q \"Why dost thou stand up to pray?\" \"To express the devout intent of the slave acknowledging the Deity.\" Q \"What are the obligatory conditions which precede standing in prayer?\" \"Purification, covering the shame, avoidance of soiled clothes, standing on a clean place, fronting the Ka'abah, an upright posture, the intent[FN#300] and the pronouncing 'Allaho Akbar' of prohibition.\"[FN#301] Q \"With what shouldest thou go forth from thy house to pray?\" \"With the intent of worship mentally pronounced.\" Q \"With what intent shouldest thou enter the mosque?\" \"With an intent of service.\" Q \"Why do we front the Kiblah[FN#302]?\" \"In obedience to three Divine orders and one Traditional ordinance.\" Q \"What are the beginning, the consecration and the end of prayer?\" \"Purification beginneth prayer, saying the Allaho Akbar of prohibition consecrateth, and the salutation endeth prayer.\" Q \"What deserveth he who neglecteth prayer?\" \"It is reported, among the authentic Traditions of the Prophet, that he said, 'Whoso neglecteth prayer wilfully and purposely hath no part in Al-Islam.'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Fortieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that after the damsel had repeated the words of that Holy Tradition the doctor cried, \"Thou hast replied aright: now say me, what is prayer?\" \"Prayer is communion between the slave and his lord, and in it are ten virtues: (1) it illumineth the heart; (2) it maketh the face shine; (3) it pleaseth the Compassionate One; (4) it angereth Satan; (5) it conjureth calamity; (6) it wardeth off the mischief of enemies; (7) it multiplieth mercy; (8) it forfendeth vengeance and punishment; (9) it bringeth the slave nigh unto his lord; and (10) it restraineth from lewdness and frowardness. Hence it is one of the absolute requisites and obligatory ordinances and the pillar of the Faith.\" Q \"What is the key of prayer?\" \"Wuzd or the lesser ablution.\"[FN#303] Q \"What is the key to the lesser ablution?\" \"Intention and naming the Almighty.\" Q \"What is the key of naming the Almighty?\" \"Assured faith.\" Q \"What is the key of faith?\" \"Trust in the Lord.\" Q \"What is the key of trust in the Lord?\" \"Hope.\" Q \"What is the key of hope?\" \"Obedience.\" Q \"What is the key of obedience?\" \"The confession of the Unity and the acknowledgment of the divinity of Allah.\" Q \"What are the Divine ordinances of Wuzu, the minor ablution?\" \"They are six, according to the canon of the Imam al-Sh\u00e1fi'\u00ed Mohammed bin Idris (of whom Allah accept!): (1) intent while washing the face; (2) washing the face; (3) washing the hands and forearms; (4) wiping part of the head; (5) washing the feet and heels; and (6) observing due order.[FN#304] And the traditional statutes are ten: (1) nomination; (2) and washing the hands before putting them into the water-pot; (3) and mouth-rinsing; (4) and snuffing;[FN#305] (5) and wiping the whole head; (6) and wetting the ears within and without with fresh water; (7) and separating a thick beard; (8) and separating the fingers and toes;[FN#306] (9) and washing the right foot before the left and (10) doing each of these thrice and all in unbroken order. When the minor ablution is ended, the worshipper should say, I testify that there is no god but the God, the One, which for partner hath none, and I testify that Mohammed is His servant and His apostle. O my Allah, make me of those who repent and in purity are permanent! Glory to Thee, O my God, and in Thy praise I bear witness, that there is no god save Thou! I crave pardon of Thee and I repent to Thee! For it is reported, in the Holy Traditions, that the Prophet (whom Allah bless and preserve!) said of this prayer, 'Whoso endeth every ablution with this prayer, the eight gates of Paradise are open to him; he shall enter at which he pleaseth.'\" Q \"When a man purposeth ablution, what betideth him from the angels and the devils?\" \"When a man prepareth for ablution, the angels come and stand on his right and the devils on his left hand.[FN#307] If he name Almighty Allah at the beginning of the ablution, the devils flee from him and the angels hover over him with a pavilion of light, having four ropes, to each an angel glorifying Allah and craving pardon for him, so long as he remaineth silent or calleth upon the name of Allah. But if he omit to begin washing with naming Allah (to whom belong might and majesty!), neither remain silent, the devils take command of him; and the angels depart from him and Satan whispereth evil thoughts unto him, till he fall into doubt and come short in his ablution. For (quoth he on whom be blessing and peace!), 'A perfect ablution driveth away Satan and assureth against the tyranny of the Sultan'; and again quoth he, 'If calamity befal one who is not pure by ablution; verily and assuredly let him blame none but himself.'\" Q \"What should a man do when he awaketh from sleep?\" \"He should wash his hands thrice, before putting them into the water vessel.\" Q \"What are the Koranic and traditional orders anent Ghusl, the complete ablution[FN#308]?\" \"The divine ordinances are intent and 'crowning'[FN#309] the whole body with water, that is, the liquid shall come at every part of the hair and skin. Now the traditional ordinances are the minor ablution as preliminary; rubbing the body; separating the hair and deferring in words[FN#310] the washing of the feet till the end of the ablution.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Forty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel had recounted to the doctor what were the divine and traditional orders anent Ghusl or total ablution, quoth he, \"Thou hast replied aright: now tell me what are the occasions for Tayammum, or making the ablution with sand and dust; and what are the ordinances thereof, divine and human?\" \"The reasons are seven, viz.: want of water; fear lest water lack; need thereto; going astray on a march; sickness; having broken bones in splints and having open wounds.[FN#311] As for its ordinances, the divine number four, viz., intent, dust, clapping it to the face and clapping it upon the hands; and the human number two, nomination and preferring the right before the left hand.\" Q \"What are the conditions, the pillars or essentials, and the traditional statutes of prayer?\" \"The conditions are five: (1) purification of the members; (2) covering of the privy parts; (3) observing the proper hours, either of certainty or to the best of one's belief; (4) fronting the Kiblah; and (5) standing on a clean place. The pillars or essentials number twelve: (1) intent; (2) the Takb\u00edr or magnification of prohibition; (3) standing when able to stand[FN#312]; (4) repeating the Fatihah or opening chapter of the Koran and saying, 'In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate!' with a verse thereof according to the canon of the Imam Al-Shafi'i; (5) bowing the body and keeping it bowed; (6) returning to the upright posture and so remaining for the time requisite; (7) prostration and permanence therein; (8) sitting between two prostrations and permanence therein; (9) repeating the latter profession of the Faith and sitting up therefor; (10) invoking benediction on the Prophet (whom Allah bless and preserve!) (11) the first Salutation,[FN#313] and (12) the intent of making an end of prayer expressed in words. But the traditional statutes are the call to prayer; the standing posture; raising the hands (to either side of the face) whilst pronouncing the prohibition; uttering the magnification before reciting the Fatihah; seeking refuge with Allah[FN#314]; saying, 'Amen'; repeating the chapter of the Koran after the Fatihah, repeating the magnifications during change of posture; saying, 'May Allah hear him who praiseth Him! and O our Lord, to Thee be the praise!'; praying aloud in the proper place[FN#315] and praying under the breath prayers so prescribed; the first profession of unity and sitting up thereto; blessing the Prophet therein; blessing his family in the latter profession and the second Salutation.\" Q \"On what is the Zak\u00e1t or obligatory poor-rate taxable?\" \"On gold and silver and camels and oxen and sheep and wheat and barley and holcus and millet and beans and vetches and rice and raisins and dates.\" Q \"What is the Zak\u00e1t or poor-rate on gold?\" \"Below twenty miskals or dinars, nothing; but on that amount half a dinar for every score and so on proportionally.[FN#316]\" Q \"On silver?\" \"Under two hundred dirhams nothing, then five dirhams on every two hundred and so forth.\" Q \"On camels?\" \"For every five, an ewe, or for every twenty-five a pregnant camel.\" Q \"On sheep?\" \"An ewe for every forty head,\" Q \"What are the ordinances of the Ramazan Fast?\" \"The Koranic are intent; abstinence from eating, drinking and carnal copulation, and the stoppage of vomiting. It is incumbent on all who submit to the Law, save women in their courses and forty days after childbirth; and it becomes obligatory on sight of the new moon or on news of its appearance, brought by a trustworthy person and commending itself as truth to the hearer's heart; and among its requisites is that the intent be pronounced at nightfall. The traditional ordinances of fasting are, hastening to break the fast at sundown; deferring the fore-dawn meal,[FN#317] and abstaining from speech, save for good works and for calling on the name of Allah and reciting the Koran.\" Q \"What things vitiate not the fast?\" \"The use of unguents and eye-powders and the dust of the road and the undesigned swallowing of saliva and the emission of seed in nocturnal pollution or at the sight of a strange woman and blooding and cupping; none of these things vitiates the fast.\" Q \"What are the prayers of the two great annual Festivals?\" \"Two one-bow prayers, which be a traditional ordinance, without call to prayer or standing up to pronounce the call;[FN#318] but let the Moslem say, 'Prayer is a collector of all folk!'[FN#319] and pronounce 'Allaho Akbar' seven times in the first prayer, besides the Takbir of prohibition; and, in the second, five times, besides the magnification of rising up (according to the doctrine of the Imam Al-Shafi'i, on whom Allah have mercy!) and make the profession of the Faith.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Forty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel had answered the doctor anent the Festival-prayers, quoth he, \"Thou hast replied aright: now tell me what are the prayers prescribed on the occasion of an eclipse of the sun or moon?\" \"Two one-bow prayers without call to prayer or standing thereto by the worshipper, who shall make in each two-bow prayer double standing up and double inclinations and two-fold prostrations, then sit and testify and salute.\" Q \"What is the ritual of prayer for rain?\" \"Two one-bow prayers without call to prayer or standing thereto; then shall the Moslem make the profession and salute.

Thereupon another man stood up and said to her, \"O damsel, hear a few questions from me.\" Quoth she, \"Say on;' and he asked, \"What are the conditions of purchase by advance?\" whereto she answered, \"That the price be fixed, the kind be fixed and the period of delivery be fixed and known.\" Q \"What are the Koranic and the traditional canons of eating?\" \"The confession that Allah Almighty provideth the eater and giveth him meat and drink, with thanksgiving to Him therefor.\" Q \"What is thanksgiving?\" \"The use by the creature of that which the Creator vouchsafeth to him, according as it was created for the creature.\" Q \"What are the traditional canons of eating?\" \"The Bismillah[FN#334] and washing both hands; sitting on the left of the hind part; eating with three fingers, and eating of that which hath been duly masticated.[FN#335]\" Q \"What are good manners in eating?\" \"Taking small mouthfuls and looking little at one's table-companion.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Forty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel had answered concerning good manners in eating, the doctor who was trying her, rejoined, \"Thou hast replied aright. Now tell me what are the stays of the heart and their supports?\"[FN#336] \"The stays and supports both number three: (1) holding fast to the Faith, the support whereof is the shunning of infidelity; (2) holding fast to the Traditional Law, and its support the shunning of innovation; and (3) holding fast to obedience, and its support the shunning of disobedience.\" Q \"What are the conditions of Wuzu?\" \"(1) being a Moslem; (2) discernment of good and evil; (3) purity of the water, and (4) absence of material or religious impediments.\" Q \"What is belief?\" \"It is divided into nine parts: (1) belief in the One worshipped; (2) belief in the condition of slavery of the worshipper; (3) belief in the personality of the Deity; (4) belief in the Two Handfuls;[FN#337] (5) belief in Providence which allotteth to man his lot; (6) belief in the Abrogating and (7) in the Abrogated; (8) belief in Allah, His angels and apostles; and (9) in fore-ordained Fate, general and individual, its good and ill, its sweet and bitter.\" Q \"What three things do away other three?\" \"It is told of Sufy\u00e1n al-Saur\u00ed[FN#338] that he said, 'Three things do away with other three.

Furthermore, the hearts of learned Olema are of three kinds, the heart which is in love with this world; the heart which loveth the next world, and the heart which loveth its Lord; and it is said that hearts are three, the suspended, that of the infidel; the non-existent, that of the hypocrite; and the constant, that of the True-believer.

If he answer them both, it is well; and if not, I will take his clothes and he shall wend in peace.\" Quoth the doctor, \"Ask me what thou wilt,\" and she said, \"What sayest thou religion is?\" Answered he, \"Religion is confession of Faith with the tongue and conviction with the heart and correspondent action with the members. He (upon whom be blessings and peace!) hath said, 'The believer is not perfect in belief, except he perfect himself in five qualities, namely: trust in Allah,[FN#341] committal of his affair to Allah, submission to the commands of Allah, acquiescence in the decrees of Allah; and that all he doth be done for sake of Allah; so is he of those who are acceptable to the Deity, and who give to Him and withhold for Him; and such man is perfect in belief.'\" Then said she, \"What is the Divine ordinance of ordinances and the ordinance which is the initiator of all ordinances and that of which all others stand in need and that which comprehendeth all others; and what is the traditional ordinance that entereth into the Koranic, and the prophetic practice whereby the Divine is completed?\" But he was silent and made no reply; whereupon the Caliph bade her expound and ordered him to doff his clothes and give them to her. Said she, \"O doctor, the Koranic ordinance of ordinances is the knowledge of Allah Almighty; that, which is the initiative of all others, is the testifying there is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God; that, of which all others have need, is the Wuzu-ablution; that, which compriseth all others, is the Ghusl-ablution from defilement[FN#342]; the Traditional ordinance that entereth into the Koranic, is the separation of the fingers and the thick beard;[FN#343] and that, wherewith all Koranic ordinances are completed, is circumcision.\"[FN#344] Therewith was made manifest the defeat of the doctor, who rose to his feet and said, \"I call Allah to witness, O Commander of the Faithful, that this damsel is more learned than I in theology and what pertaineth to the Law.\" So saying, he put off his clothes and went away ignominiously worsted. Then she turned to the rest of the learned men present and said, \"O masters, which of you is the Koranist, the reader and reciter of the Koran, versed in the seven readings and in syntax and in lexicography?\" Thereupon a professor arose and, seating himself before her, said \"Hast thou read the Book of Almighty Allah and made thyself thoroughly acquainted with its signs, that is its verses, and its abrogating parts and abrogated portions, its unequivocal commands and its ambiguous; and the difference of its revelations, Meccan and Medinan? Dost thou understand its interpretation and hast thou studied it, according to the various traditions and origins?\" \"Yes,\" answered she; and he said, \"What then is the number of its chapters, how many are the decades and versets, how many words and how many letters and how many acts of prostration and how many prophets and how many chapters are Medinan and how many are Meccan and how many birds are mentioned in it?\" Replied she, \"O my lord, its chapters are an hundred and fourteen, whereof seventy were revealed at Meccah and forty-four at Al-Medinah; and it containeth six hundred and twenty-one decades; six thousand three hundred and thirty-six versets;[FN#345] seventy-nine thousand four hundred and thirty-nine words and three hundred and twenty-three thousand and six hundred and seventy letters; and to the reader thereof, for every letter, are given ten benefits. The acts of prostration it compriseth are fourteen.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Forty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the professor of Koranic exegesis questioned the damsel, she continued, \"As regards the Prophets named in the Book there be five-and-twenty, to wit, Adam, Noah,[FN#346] Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Lot, Elisha, Jonah, Salih,[FN#347] or Heber, H\u00fad,[FN#348] Shua'yb or Jethro,[FN#349] David, Solomon, Z\u00fa'l-kafl or Joshua, Idr\u00eds, Elias, Yahy\u00e1 or John the Baptist, Zacharias, Job, Moses, Aaron, Jesus and Mohammed,[FN#350] the peace of Allah and His blessing be on them all! Moreover, nine flying things are mentioned in the Koran, namely, the gnat, the bee, the fly, the ant, the hoopoe, the crow, the locust, the swallow and the bird of Jesus[FN#351] (on whom be peace!), to wit, the bat.\" Q \"Which is the most excellent chapter of the Koran?\" \"That of The Cow.[FN#352]\" Q \"Which is the most magnificent verse?\" \"That of the Throne; it hath fifty words, bearing in each fifty blessings.\" Q \"What sign or verse hath in it nine signs or wonders?\" \"That in which quoth Allah Almighty, 'Verily, in the creation of the Heaven and the Earth: and in the vicissitude of night, and day; and in the ship which saileth through the sea laden with what is profitable for mankind; and in the rain-water which God sendeth down from Heaven, quickening thereby the dead ground and replenishing the same with all sorts of cattle; and in the change of winds and in the clouds that are compelled to do service between the Heaven and the Earth;[FN#353]\u2014are signs to people of understanding.'\" Q \"Which verse is the most just?\" \"That in which Allah saith, 'Verily, Allah enjoineth justice and the doing of good, and the giving unto kindred what shall be necessary; and He forbiddeth wickedness and iniquity and oppression'\"[FN#354] Q \"Which is the most greedy?\" \"That in which quoth Allah, 'Is it that every man of them greedeth to enter the Garden of Delight?'\"[FN#355] Q \"Which is the most hopeful?\" \"That in which quoth Almighty Allah, 'Say: O my servants who have transgressed against your own souls, despair not of the mercy of Allah; seeing, that Allah forgiveth all sins; aye Gracious, Merciful is He.'\"[FN#356] Q \"By what school of intonation dost thou read?\" \"By that of the people of Paradise, to wit, the version of N\u00e1f'i.\" Q \"In which verse doth Allah make prophets lie?\"[FN#357] \"In that wherein He saith, 'They (the brothers of Joseph) brought his inner garment stained with false blood.'\"[FN#358] Q \"In which doth He make unbelievers speak the truth?\" \"In that wherein He saith, 'The Jews say, 'The Christians are grounded on nothing,' and the Christians say, 'The Jews are grounded on nothing'; and yet they both read the Scriptures;'[FN#359] and, so saying, all say sooth.\" Q \"In which doth God speak in his own person?\" \"In that in which he saith, 'I have not created Genii and men for any other end than that they should serve me.'\"[FN#360] Q \"In which verse do the angels speak?\" \"In that which saith, 'But we celebrate Thy praise and extol Thy holiness.'\"[FN#361] Q \"What sayest thou of the formula:\u2014I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned?\" \"It is obligatory by commandment of Allah on all before reading the Koran, as appeareth by His saying, 'When thou readest the Koran, seek refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned.'\"[FN#362] Q \"What signify the words 'seeking refuge'[FN#363] and what are the variants of the formula?\" \"Some say, 'I take refuge with Allah the All-hearing and All-knowing,' and others, 'With Allah the Strong;' but the best is that whereof the Sublime Koran speaketh and the Traditions perpetuate. And he (whom Allah bless and keep!) was used to ejaculate, 'I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned.' And quoth a Tradition, reported by Naf'i on the authority of his adopted father, 'The apostle of Allah, was wont when he rose in the night to pray, to say aloud, 'Allaho Akbar'; God is Most Great, with all Majesty! Praise be to Allah abundantly! Glory to Allah morn and even be!' Then would he say, 'I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned and from the delusions of the Devils and their evil suggestions.' And it is told of Ibn Abbas[FN#364] (of whom Allah accept!) that he said, 'The first time Gabriel came down to the Prophet with revelation he taught him the 'seeking refuge,' saying, 'O Mohammed, say, I seek refuge with Allah the All-hearing and All-knowing;' then say, 'In the name of Allah the Compassionating, the Compassionate!' Read, in the name of thy Lord who created;\u2014created man of blood-clots.\"[FN#365] Now when the Koranist heard her words he marvelled at her expressions, her eloquence, her learning, her excellence, and said, \"O damsel, what sayst thou of the verse 'In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate'? Is it one of the verses of the Koran?\" \"Yes; it is a verset of 'The Ant'[FN#366] occurring also at the head of the first and between every two following chapters; and there is much difference of opinion, respecting this, among the learned.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Forty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel had told the professor concerning the difference of opinion among the learned touching the \"Basmalah,\" he said, \"Thou hast replied aright: now tell me why is not the formula written at the head of the chapter of Immunity[FN#367]?\"; and she answered, \"When this chapter was revealed from on high for the dissolution of the alliance between the Prophet and the idolaters, He (whom Allah bless and preserve!) sent Ali[FN#368] ibn Ab\u00ed T\u00e1lib (whose face Allah honour!) therewith, and he read the chapter to them, but did not read the Basmalah.\"[FN#369] Q \"What of the excellence of the formula and its blessing?\" \"It is told of the Prophet that he said, 'Never is the Basmalah pronounced over aught, but there is a blessing in it;' and it is reported, on authority of Him (whom Allah bless and preserve!) that the Lord of Glory swore by His glory that never should the Basmalah be pronounced over a sick person, but he should be healed of his sickness. Moreover, it is said that, when Allah created the empyrean, it was agitated with an exceeding agitation; but He wrote on it, 'Bismillah' and its agitation subsided. When the formula first descended from heaven to the Prophet, he said, 'I am safe from three things, earthquake and metamorphosis and drowning; and indeed its boons are great and its blessings too many to enumerate. It is told of Allah's Apostle that he said, 'There will be brought on the Judgment-day a man with whom He shall reckon and finding no good deed to his account, shall order him to the Fire; but the man will cry, 'O my God, Thou hast not dealt justly by me!' Then shall Allah (to whom be honour and glory!) say, 'How so?' and the man shall answer, O Lord, for that Thou callest Thyself the Compassionating, the Compassionate, yet wilt Thou punish me with the Fire!' And Allah (magnified be His Majesty!) shall reply, 'I did indeed name myself the Compassionating, the Compassionate. Carry My servant to Paradise, of My mercy, for I am the most Merciful of the mercifuls!'\" Q \"What was the origin of the use of the Basmalah?\" \"When Allah sent down from Heaven the Koran, they wrote, 'In Thy name, O my God!'; when Allah revealed the words, 'Say: Call upon Allah, or call upon the Compassionating, what days ye pray, for hath He the most excellent names,'[FN#370] they wrote, 'In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate; and, when He revealed the words, 'Your God is one God, there is no God but He, the Compassionating, the Compassionate,'[FN#371] they wrote, 'In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate!'\" Now when the Koranist heard her reply, he hung down his head and said to himself, \"This be a marvel of marvels! How hath this slave-girl expounded the origin of the Basmalah? But, by Allah, needs must I go a bout with her and haply defeat her.\" So he asked, \"Did Allah reveal the Koran all at once or at times manifold?\" She answered, \"Gabriel the Faithful (on whom be peace!) descended with it from the Lord of the Worlds upon His Prophet Mohammed, Prince of the Apostles and Seal of the Prophets, by detached versets: bidding and forbidding, covenanting and comminating, and containing advices and instances in the course of twenty years as occasion called for it.\" Q \"Which chapter was first revealed?\" \"According to Ibn Abbas, that entituled 'Congealed Blood':[FN#372] and, according to J\u00e1bir bin Abdillah,[FN#373] that called 'The Covered' which preceded all others.[FN#374]\" Q \"Which verset was the last revealed?\" \"That of 'Usury',[FN#375] and it is also said, the verse, 'When there cometh Allah's succour and victory.'\"[FN#376]\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Forty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel told the Koranist which was the last verse he said, \"Thou hast replied aright; now tell me the names of the Companions who collected the Koran, in the lifetime of the Apostle of Allah.\" And she answered \"They were four, Ubay ibn Ka'ab, Zayd ibn S\u00e1bit, Ab\u00fa Obaydah 'Aamir bin Jarr\u00e1h, and Othm\u00e1n bin Aff\u00e1n[FN#377] (Allah accept of them one and all!)\" Q \"Who are the readers, from whom the accepted reading of the Koran is taken?\" \"They number four, Abdallah bin Mas'\u00fad, Ubay bin Ka'ab, Ma'az bin Jabal and S\u00e1lim bin Abdillah.\" Q \"What sayest thou of the words of the Most High, 'That which is sacrificed to stones'\"?[FN#378] \"The stones are idols, which are set up and worshipped, instead of Allah the Most High, and from this we seek refuge with Allah.\" Q \"What sayest thou of the words of the Most High 'Thou knowest what is in my soul, and I know not what is in Thy soul'\"?[FN#379] \"They mean, 'Thou knowest the truth of me and what is in me, and I know not what is in Thee;' and the proof of this are His words,[FN#380] 'Thou art He who wottest the hidden things'; and it is said, also, 'Thou knowest my essence, but I know not Thine essence.'\" Q \"What sayst thou of the words of the Most High, 'O true believers, forbid not yourselves the good things which Allah hath allowed you?'\"[FN#381] \"My Shaykh (on whom Allah have mercy!) told me that the Companion Al-Zahh\u00e1k related: 'There was a people of the True-believers who said, 'We will dock our members masculine and don sackcloth;' whereupon this verse was revealed.

Tell me, therefore, how is man made; how many veins, bones and vertebrae are there in his body; which is the first and chief vein and why Adam was named Adam?\" She replied, \"Adam was called Adam, because of his udmah, that is, the wheaten colour of his complexion and also (it is said) because he was created of the adim of the earth, that is to say, of the surface-soil. His breast was made of the earth of the Ka'abah, his head of earth from the East and his legs of earth from the West. There were created for him seven doors in his head, viz., the eyes, the ears, the nostrils and the mouth, and two passages, before and behind. The eyes were made the seat of the sight-sense, the ears the seat of the hearing-sense, the nostrils the seat of the smell-sense, the mouth the seat of the taste-sense and the tongue to utter what is in the heart of man.[FN#393] Now Adam was made of a compound of the four elements, which be water, earth, fire and air. The yellow bile is the humour of fire, being hot-dry; the black bile that of earth, being cold-dry; the phlegm that of water, being cold-moist, and the blood that of air, being hot-moist.[FN#394] There were made in man three hundred and sixty veins, two hundred and forty-nine bones, and three souls[FN#395] or spirits, the animal, the rational and the natural, to each of which is allotted its proper function. Moreover, Allah made him a heart and spleen and lungs and six intestines and a liver and two kidneys and buttocks and brain and bones and skin and five senses; hearing, seeing, smell, taste, touch. The heart He set on the left side of the breast and made the stomach the guide and governor thereof. He appointed the lungs for a fan to the heart and stablished the liver on the right side, opposite thereto. Moreover, He made, besides this, the diaphragm and the viscera and set up the bones of the breast and latticed them with the ribs.\" Q \"How many ventricles are there in a man's head?\" \"Three, which contain five faculties, styled the intrinsic senses, to wit, common sense, imagination, the thinking faculty, perception and memory.\" Q \"Describe to me the configuration of the bones.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Fiftieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the physicist said to her, \"Describe to me the configuration of the bones,\" she replied, \"Man's frame consists of two hundred and forty bones, which are divided into three parts, the head, the trunk and the extremities. The head is divided into calvarium and face. The skull is constructed of eight bones, and to it are attached the four osselets of the ear. The face is furnished with an upper jaw of eleven bones and a lower jaw of one; and to these are added the teeth two-and-thirty in number, and the os hyoides.[FN#396] The trunk is divided into spinal column, breast and basin. The spinal column is made up of four-and-twenty bones, called Fik\u00e1r or vertebr\u00e6; the breast, of the breastbone and the ribs, which are four-and-twenty in number, twelve on each side; and the basin of the hips, the sacrum[FN#397] and os coccygis. The extremities divided into upper and lower, arms and legs. The arms are again divided: firstly into shoulder, comprising shoulder blades and collar bone; secondly into the upper arm which is one bone; thirdly into fore-arm, composed of two bones, the radius and the ulna; and fourthly into the hand, consisting of the wrist, the metacarpus of five and the fingers, which number five, of three bones each, called the phalanges, except the thumb, which hath but two. The lower extremities are divided: firstly into thigh, which is one bone; secondly into leg, composed of three bones, the tibia, the fibula and the patella; and thirdly into the foot, divided, like the hand, into tarsus, metatarsus and toes; and is composed of seven bones, ranged in two rows, two in one and five in the other; and the metatarsus is composed of five bones and the toes number five, each of three phalanges except the big toe which hath only two.\" Q \"Which is the root of the veins?\" \"The aorta, from which they ramify, and they are many, none knoweth the tale of them save He who created them; but I repeat, it is said that they number three hundred and sixty.[FN#398] Moreover, Allah hath appointed the tongue as interpreter for the thought, the eyes to serve as lanterns, the nostrils to smell with, and the hands for prehensors. The liver is the seat of pity, the spleen of laughter[FN#399] and the kidneys of craft; the lungs are ventilators, the stomach the store-house, and the heart the prop and pillar of the body. When the heart is sound, the whole body is sound, and when the heart is corrupt, the whole body is corrupt.\" Q \"What are the outward signs and symptoms evidencing disease in the members of the body, both external and internal?\" \"A physician, who is a man of understanding, looketh into the state of the body and is guided by the feel of the hands,[FN#400] according as they are firm or flabby, hot or cool, moist or dry. Internal disorders are also indicated by external symptoms, such as yellowness of the white of the eyes, which denoteth jaundice, and bending of the back, which denoteth disease of the lungs.\" And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel had described to the doctor the outer signs and symptoms quoth he, \"Thou hast replied aright! now what are the internal symptoms of disease?\" \"The science of the diagnosis of disease by internal symptoms is founded upon six canons: (1) the patient's actions; (2) what is evacuated from his body; (3) the nature of the pain; and (4) the site thereof; (5) swelling; and (6) the effluvia given off his person.\" Q \"How cometh hurt to the head?\" \"By the ingestion of food upon food, before the first be digested, and by fullness upon fullness; this it is that wasteth peoples. He who would live long, let him be early with the morning-meal and not late with the evening-meal; let him be sparing of commerce with women and chary of such depletory measures as cupping and blood-letting; and let him make of his belly three parts, one for food, one for drink and the third for air; for that a man's intestines are eighteen spans in length and it befitteth that he appoint six for meat, six for drink, and six for breath. If he walk, let him go gently; it will be wholesomer for him and better for his body and more in accordance with the saying of the Almighty, 'Walk not proudly on the earth.'\"[FN#401] Q \"What are the symptoms of yellow bile and what is to be feared therefrom?\" \"The symptoms are sallow complexion and bitter taste in the mouth with dryness; failure of the appetite, venereal and other, and rapid pulse; and the patient hath to fear high fever and delirium and eruptions and jaundice and tumour and ulcers of the bowels and excessive thirst.\" Q \"What are the symptoms of black bile and what hath the patient to fear from it, an it get the mastery of the body?\" \"The symptoms are false appetite and great mental disquiet and cark and care; and it behoveth that it be evacuated, else it will generate melancholia[FN#402] and leprosy and cancer and disease of the spleen and ulceration of the bowels.\" Q \"Into how many branches is the art of medicine divided?\" \"Into two: the art of diagnosing diseases, and that of restoring the diseased body to health.\" Q \"When is the drinking of medicine more efficacious than otherwhen?\" \"When the sap runs in the wood and the grape thickens in the cluster and the two auspicious planets, Jupiter and Venus, are in the ascendant; then setteth in the proper season for drinking of drugs and doing away of disease.\" Q \"What time is it, when, if a man drink water from a new vessel, the drink is sweeter and lighter or more digestible to him than at another time, and there ascendeth to him a pleasant fragrance and a penetrating?\" \"When he waiteth awhile after eating, as quoth the poet,\n\n'Drink not upon thy food in haste but wait awhile; * Else thou\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     with halter shalt thy frame to sickness lead:\nAnd patient bear a little thirst from food, then drink; * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     thus, O brother, haply thou shalt win thy need.[FN#403]'\"\n\nQ \"What food is it that giveth not rise to ailments?\" \"That which is not eaten but after hunger, and when it is eaten, the ribs are not filled with it, even as saith J\u00e1l\u00edn\u00fas or Galen the physician, 'Whoso will take in food, let him go slowly and he shall not go wrongly.' And to conclude with His saying (on whom be blessing and peace!), 'The stomach is the house of disease, and diet is the head of healing; for the origin of all sickness is indigestion, that is to say, corruption of the meat'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-second Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel said to the doctor, \"'The stomach is the house of disease and diet is the head of healing; for the origin of all sickness is indigestion, that is to say, corruption of the meat in the stomach;'\" he rejoined, \"Thou hast replied aright! what sayest thou of the Hammam?\" \"Let not the full man enter it.

The most excellent of food is brewis[FN#404] or bread sopped in broth; according to the saying of the Prophet, 'Brewis excelleth other food, even as Ayishah excelleth other women.'\" Q \"What kind of kitchen, or seasoning, is most profitable?\" \"'Flesh meat' (quoth the Prophet) 'is the most excellent of kitchen; for that it is the delight of this world and the next world.'\" Q \"What kind of meat is the most profitable?\" \"Mutton; but jerked meat is to be avoided, for there is no profit in it.\" Q \"What of fruits?\" \"Eat them in their prime and quit them when their season is past.\" Q \"What sayest thou of drinking water?\" \"Drink it not in large quantities nor swallow it by gulps, or it will give thee head-ache and cause divers kinds of harm; neither drink it immediately after leaving the Hammam nor after carnal copulation or eating (except it be after the lapse of fifteen minutes for a young man and forty for an old man), nor after waking from sleep.\" Q \"What of drinking fermented liquors?\" \"Doth not the prohibition suffice thee in the Book of Almighty Allah, where He saith, 'Verily, wine and lots and images, and the divining arrows are an abomination, of Satan's work; therefore avoid them, that ye may prosper'?[FN#405] And again, 'They will ask thee concerning wine and lots': Answer, 'In both there is great sin and also some things of use unto men: but their sinfulness is greater than their use.'[FN#406] Hence quoth the poet,\n\n'O bibber of liquor, art not ashamed * To drink what Allah\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     forbade thee drain?\nPut it far from thee and approach it not; * It holds what Allah\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     forbade as bane.'\n\nAnd quoth another to the same purport,\n\n'I drank the sin till my reason fled: * Ill drink that reason to loss misled!'\n\nAs for the advantages that be therein, it disperseth stone and gravel from the kidneys and strengtheneth the viscera and banisheth care, and moveth to generosity and preserveth health and digestion; it conserveth the body, expelleth disease from the joints, purifieth the frame of corrupt humours, engendereth cheerfulness, gladdeneth the heart of man and keepeth up the natural heat: it contracteth the bladder, enforceth the liver and removeth obstructions, reddeneth the cheeks, cleareth away maggots from the brain and deferreth grey hairs. In short, had not Allah (to whom be honour and glory!) forbidden it,[FN#407] there were not on the face of the earth aught fit to stand in its stead. As for gambling by lots, it is a game of hazard such as diceing, not of skill.\" Q \"What wine is best?\" \"That which is pressed from white grapes and kept eighty days or more after fermentation: it resembleth not water and indeed there is nothing on the surface of the earth like unto it.\" Q \"What sayest thou of cupping?\" \"It is for him who is over full of blood and who hath no defect therein; and whoso would be cupped, let it be during the wane of the moon, on a day without cloud, wind or rain and on the seventeenth of the month.

It is reported of the Prophet that, when anyone complained to him of a pain in the head or legs, he would bid him be cupped and after cupping not eat salt food, fasting, for it engendereth scurvy; neither eat sour things as curded milk[FN#408] immediately after cupping.\" Q \"When is cupping to be avoided?\" \"On Sabbaths or Saturdays and Wednesdays; and let him who is cupped on these days blame none but himself. Moreover, one should not be cupped in very hot weather nor in very cold weather; and the best season for cupping is springtide.\" Quoth the doctor, \"Now tell me of carnal copulation.\" Hereupon Tawaddud hung her head, for shame and confusion before the Caliph's majesty; then said, \"By Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, it is not that I am at fault, but that I am ashamed; though, indeed, the answer is on the edge of my tongue.\" Said the Caliph; \"Speak, O damsel,\" whereupon said she, \"Copulation hath in it many and exceeding virtues and praiseworthy qualities, amongst which are, that it lighteneth a body full of black bile and calmeth the heat of love and induceth affection and dilateth the heart and dispelleth the sadness of solitude; and the excess of it is more harmful in summer and autumn than in spring and winter.\" Q \"What are its good effects?\" \"It banisheth trouble and disquiet, calmeth love and wrath and is good for ulcers, especially in a cold and dry humour; on the other hand excess of it weakeneth the sight and engendereth pains in the legs and head and back: and beware, beware of carnal connection with old women, for they are deadly. Quoth the Iman Ali[FN#409] (whose face Allah honour!), 'Four things kill and ruin the body: entering the Hammam on a full stomach; eating salt food; copulation on a plethora of blood and lying with an ailing woman; for she will weaken thy strength and infect thy frame with sickness; and an old woman is deadly poison.' And quoth one of them, 'Beware of taking an old woman to wife, though she be richer in hoards than K\u00e1r\u00fan'\"[FN#410] Q \"What is the best copulation?\" \"If the woman be tender of years, comely of shape, fair of face, swelling of breast and of noble race, she will add to thee strength and health of body; and let her be even as saith a certain poet describing her,\n\n'Seeing thy looks wots she what thou desir'st, * By inspiration;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     wants nor word nor sign;\nAnd, when thou dost behold her rarest grace, * The charms of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     every garden canst decline.'\n\nQ \"At what time is copulation good?\" \"If by night, after food digested and if by day, after the morning meal.\" Q \"What are the most excellent fruits?\" \"Pomegranate and citron.\" Q \"Which is the most excellent of vegetables?\" \"Endive.[FN#411]\" Q \"Which of sweet-scented flowers?\" \"Rose and Violet.\" Q \"How is the seed of man secreted?\" \"There is in man a vein which feedeth all the other veins. Now water is collected from the three hundred and sixty veins and, in the form of red blood, entereth the left testicle, where it is decocted, by the heat of temperament inherent in the son of Adam, into a thick, white liquid, whose odour is as that of the palm-spathe.\" Q \"What flying thing is it that emitteth seed and menstruateth?\" \"The flitter-mouse,[FN#412] that is the bat.\" Q \"What is that which, when confined and shut out from the air liveth, and when let out to smell the air dieth?\" \"The fish.\" Q \"What serpent layeth eggs?\" \"The Su'ban or dragon.[FN#413]\" With this the physician waxed weary with much questioning, and held his peace, when Tawaddud said to the Caliph, \"O Commander of the Faithful, he hath questioned me till he is tired out and now I will ask him one question, which if he answer not, I will take his clothes as lawful prize.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-fourth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel said to the Commander of the Faithful, \"Verily he hath questioned me till he is tired out, and now I will ask him one question, which if he answer not I will take his clothes as lawful prize,\" the Caliph cried, \"Ask on.\" So quoth she to the physician, \"What is that thing which resembleth the earth in roundness, whose resting-place and whose spine are hidden from men's eyes; little of price and estimation; narrow of chest and shackled as to throat though it be nor runaway slave nor pestilent thief; thrust through and through, though not in fray, and wounded, though not in fight: time eateth its vigour and water wasteth it away; now it is beaten without blemish, and then made to serve without stint; united after separation; submissive, but not to him who caresseth it; pregnant without child in belly; drooping, yet not leaning on its side; becoming dirty yet purifying itself; cleaving to its fere, yet changing; copulating without a yard, wrestling without arms: resting and taking its ease; bitten, yet not crying out: now more complaisant than a cup-companion and then more troublesome than summer-heat; leaving its mate by night and embracing her by day and having its abode in the corners of the mansions of the noble?\" The physician was silent awhile in perplexity and his colour changed and he bowed his head and made no reply; whereupon she said to him, \"Ho, sir doctor, speak or doff thy dress.\" At this, he rose and said, \"O Commander of the Faithful, bear witness against me that this damsel is more learned than I in medicine and what else, and that I cannot cope with her.\" And he put off his clothes and fled forth. Quoth the Caliph to Tawaddud, \"Ree us thy riddle,\" and she replied, \"O Commander of the Faithful, it is the button and the button-loop.[FN#414]\"\u2014Then she undertook the astronomers and said, \"Let him of you who is an astronomer rise and come forward.\" So the astronomer advanced and sat down before her; and, when she saw him, she laughed and said, \"Art thou the astronomer, the mathematician, the scribe?\" \"Yes,\" answered he. Quoth she, \"Ask of what thou wilt; success resteth with Allah.\" So he said, \"Tell me of the sun and its rising and setting.\" And she replied: \"Know that the sun riseth from the shadows in the Eastern hemisphere and setteth in the shadows of the Western, and each hemisphere compriseth one hundred and eighty degrees. Quoth Allah Almighty, 'I swear by the Lord of the East and of the West.'[FN#415] And again, 'He it is who hath ordained the sun to shine by day, and the moon for a light by night; and hath appointed her station that ye might know the number of years and the computation of time.'[FN#416] The moon is Sultan of the night and the sun Sultan of the day, and they vie with each other in their courses and follow without overtaking each other. Quoth Almighty Allah, 'It is not expedient that the sun overtake the moon in her course; neither doth the night outstrip the day, but each of these luminaries moveth in a peculiar orbit.'\"[FN#417] Q \"When the day cometh, what becometh of the night; and what of the day, when the night cometh?\" \"He causeth the night to enter in upon the day, and He causeth the day to enter in upon the night.\"[FN#418] Q \"Enumerate to me the mansions of the moon?\"[FN#419] \"They number eight-and-twenty, to wit, Sharat\u00e1n, Butayn, Suray\u00e1, Dabar\u00e1n, Hak'ah, Han'ah, Zir\u00e1'a, Nasrah, Tarf, Jabhah, Zubrah, Sarfah, 'Aww\u00e1, Sim\u00e1k, Ghafar, Zub\u00e1n\u00ed, Ikl\u00edl, Kalb, Shaulah, Na'am, Baldah, Sa'ad al-Z\u00e1bih, Sa'ad al-Bul'a, Sa'ad al-Su'\u00fad, Sa'ad al-Akhbiyah, Fargh the Former and Fargh the Latter; and Rish\u00e1a.

She answered, \"The sitting is narrow for so large a matter, but I will say as much as I can. Now the planets number seven; which are, the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. The Sun, hot-dry, sinister in conjunction, favourable in opposition, abideth thirty days in each Sign. The Moon, cold-moist and favourable of aspect, tarrieth in each Sign two days and a third of another day. Mercury is of a mixed nature, favourable in conjunction with the favourable, and sinister in conjunction with the sinister aspects, and abideth in each sign seventeen days and a half day. Venus, temperate and favourable, abideth in each sign five-and-twenty days. Mars is sinister and woneth in each sign ten months. Jupiter is auspicious and abideth in each sign a year. Saturn, cold-dry and sinister, tarrieth in each sign thirty months. The house of the Sun is Leo, her ascendant is Aries, and her descendant Aquarius. The Moon's house is Cancer, his ascendant Taurus, his descendant Scorpio and his sinister aspect Capricorn. Saturn's house is Capricorn-Aquarius, his ascendant Libra, his descendant Aries and his sinister aspects Cancer and Leo. Jupiter's house is Pisces-Sagittarius, his ascendant Cancer, his descendant Capricorn and his sinister aspects Gemini and Leo. Venus's house is Taurus, her ascendant Pisces, her descendant Libra, and her sinister aspects Aries and Scorpio. Mercury's house is Gemini-Virgo, his ascendant Virgo, his descendant Pisces, and his sinister aspect Taurus. Mars' house is Aries-Scorpio, his ascendant Capricorn, his descendant Cancer and his sinister aspect Libra.\" Now when the astronomer saw her acuteness and comprehensive learning and heard her fair answers, he bethought him for a sleight to confound her before the Commander of the Faithful, and said to her, \"O damsel, tell me, will rain fall this month?\" At this she bowed her head and pondered so long, that the Caliph thought her at a loss for an answer and the astronomer said to her, \"Why dost thou not speak?\" Quoth she, \"I will not speak except the Commander of the Faithful give me leave.\" So the Caliph laughed and said, \"How so?\" Cried she \"I would have thee give me a sword, that I may strike off his head, for he is an Infidel, an Agnostic, an Atheist.[FN#421]\" At this, loud laughed the Caliph and those about him laughed, and she continued \"O astronomer, there are five things that none knoweth save Allah Almighty;\" and she repeated the verset; \"'Aye! Allah!\u2014with Him is the knowledge of the hour and He causeth the rain to descend at His own appointed time \u2014and He knoweth what is in the wombs of females\u2014but no soul knoweth what it shall have gotten on the morrow; neither wotteth any soul in what land it shall die: Verily Allah is knowing, informed of all.'\"[FN#422] Quoth the astronomer, \"Thou hast said well, and I, by Allah, thought only to try thee.\" Rejoined she, \"Know that the almanack-makers have certain signs and tokens, referring to the planets and constellations relative to the coming in of the year; and folk have learned something by experience.\" Q \"What be that?\" \"Each day hath a planet that ruleth it: so if the first day in the year fall on First Day (Sunday) that day is the Sun's and this portendeth (though Allah alone is All-knowing!) oppression of kings and sultans and governors and much miasma and lack of rain; and that people will be in great tumult and the grain-crop will be good, except lentils, which will perish, and the vines will rot and flax will be dear and wheat cheap from the beginning of T\u00fabah to the end of Barmah\u00e1t.[FN#423] And, in this year there will be much fighting among kings, and there shall be great plenty of good in this year, but Allah is All-knowing!\" Q \"What if the first day fall on Second Day (Monday)?\" \"That day belongeth to the Moon and portendeth righteousness in administrators and officials and that it will be a year of much rain and grain-crops will be good, but linseed will decay and wheat will be cheap in the month Kiy\u00e1hk;[FN#424] also the plague will rage and the sheep and goats will die, grapes will be plentiful and honey scarce and cotton cheap; and Allah is omniscient!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel ended her notice of Second Day the astronomer said to her \"Now tell me what will occur if New Year's day fall on Third Day (Tuesday).\" She replied, \"That is Mars' day and portendeth death of great men and much destruction and deluge of blood and dearness of grain; lack of rain and scarcity of fish, which will anon be in excess and anon fail. Lentils and honey in this year will be cheap and linseed dear and only barley will thrive, to the exception of all other cereals: great will be the fighting among kings and death will be in the blood and there will be much mortality among asses.\" Q \"What if it fall on Fourth Day?\" \"That is Mercury's day and portendeth great tumult among the folk and much enmity and, though rains be moderate, rotting of some of the green crops; also that there will be sore mortality among cattle and young children and much fighting by sea; that wheat will be dear from Barm\u00fadah to Misra[FN#425] and other grains cheap; thunder and lightning will abound and honey will be dear, palm- trees will thrive and bear abundantly and flax and cotton will be plentiful, while radishes and onions will be dear; but Allah is All-knowing!\" Q \"What if it fall on Fifth Day?\" \"That is Jupiter's day and portendeth equity in Wazirs and righteousness in Kazis and Fakirs and the Ministers of religion; and that good will be plentiful: rains and fruit and trees and grain will abound, and flax, cotton, honey, grapes and fish be cheap; and Allah is Omniscient!\" Q \"What if it fall on Meeting Day or Friday?\" \"That day appertaineth to Venus and portendeth oppression in the chiefs of the Jinn and talk of forgery and back-biting; there will be much dew; the autumn crops will be good in the land and there will be cheapness in one town and not in another: ungraciousness will be rife by land and sea; linseed will be dear, also wheat, in H\u00e1t\u00far, but cheap in Amsh\u00edr; honey will be dear and grapes and water-melons will rot; and Allah is Omniscient!\" Q \"What if it fall on the Sabbath (Saturday)?\" \"That is Saturn's day and portendeth the preferment of slaves and Greeks and those in whom there is no good, neither in their neighbourhood; there will be great drought and dearth; clouds will abound and death will be rife among the sons of Adam and woe to the people of Egypt and Syria from the oppression of the Sultan and failure of blessing upon the green crops and rotting of grain; and Allah is All-knowing!\"[FN#426] Now with this, the astronomer hung his head very low, and she said to him, \"O astronomer, I will ask thee one question, which if thou answer not, I will take thy clothes.\" \"Ask,\" replied he.

Quoth Allah Almighty, 'Verily, we have dight the sky of the earth with the adornment of the stars; and have appointed them for projectiles against every rebellious Satan.'[FN#428] And the third part is hung in air to illuminate the seas and give light to what is therein.\" Quoth the astronomer, \"I have one more question to ask, which if she answer, I will avow myself beaten.\" \"Say on,\" answered she.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-seventh Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the astronomer said, \"Now tell me what four contraries are based upon other four contraries?\" Replied she, \"The four qualities of Caloric and Frigoric, Humidity and Siccity; for of heat Allah created fire, whose nature is hot-dry; of dryness, earth, which is cold-dry; of cold, water which is cold-wet; of moisture, air, which is hot-wet.

Then quoth the Caliph, \"Where is the philosopher[FN#429]?\"; at which one rose hastily and came forward and said to Tawaddud, \"What is Time and what be its limits, and its days, and what things bringeth it?\" Replied she, \"Time is a term applied to the hours of the night and day, which are but the measures of the courses of the sun and moon in their several heavens, even as Allah Almighty telleth us when he saith, 'A sign to them also is the Night, from which we strip off the day, and lo! they are plunged in darkness, and the Sun runneth to her place of rest; this is the ordinance of the Sublime, the All-knowing.'\"[FN#430] Q \"How cometh unbelief to the son of Adam?\" \"It is reported of the Apostle (whom Allah bless and preserve!) that he said, 'Unbelief in a man runneth as the blood runneth in his veins, when he revileth the world and Time and night and the Hour.'

Let us return to what we were about.\" When the Caliph Harun al-Rashid heard her, he stood up and said, \"Thou hast spoken well, by the Lord of the Ka'abah, O Tawaddud!\" Then quoth Ibrahim the rhetorician, \"What meaneth the poet when he saith,\n\n'Slim-wasted one, whose taste is sweetest-sweet, * Likest a lance\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     whereon no head we scan:\nAnd all the lieges find it work them weal, * Eaten of afternoon\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     in Ramazan.'\"\n\nShe answered, \"The sugar-cane;\" and he said, \"Tell me of many things.\" Asked she, \"What are they?\" and he said, \"What is sweeter than honey; what is sharper than the sword; what is swifter than poison; what is the delight of a moment and what the contentment of three days; what is the pleasantest of days; what is the joy of a week; what is that debt the worst debtor denieth not; what is the prison of the tomb; what is the joy of the heart; what is the snare of the soul; what is death-in-life; what is the disease that may not be healed; what is the shame that may not be wiped off; what is the beast that woneth not in cultivated fields, but lodgeth in waste places and hateth the sons of Adam and hath in him somewhat of the make of seven strong and violent beasts?\" Quoth she, \"Hear what I shall say in reply; then put off thy clothes, that I may explain to thee;\" and the Caliph said, \"Expound, and he shall doff his clothes.\" So she said, \"Now that, which is sweeter than honey, is the love of pious children to their two parents; that, which is sharper than the sword, is the tongue; that, which is swifter than poison, is the Envier's eye; the delight of a moment is carnal copulation and the contentment of three days is the depilatory for women; the pleasantest of days is that of profit on merchandise; the joy of a week is the bride; the debt, which the worst debtor denieth not, is death; the prison of the tomb is a bad son; the joy of the heart is a woman obedient to her husband (and it is said also that, when fleshmeat descendeth upon the heart, it rejoiceth therein); the snare of the soul is a disobedient slave; death-in-life is poverty; the disease that may not be healed is an ill-nature, and the shame that may not be wiped away is an ill daughter; lastly, the beast that woneth not in cultivated fields, but lodgeth in waste places and hateth the sons of Adam and hath in him somewhat of the make of seven strong and violent beasts, is the locust, whose head is as the head of a horse, its neck as the neck of the bull, its wings as the wings of the vulture, its feet as the feet of the camel, its tail as the tail of the serpent, its belly as the belly of the scorpion and its horns as the horns of the gazelle.\" The Caliph was astounded at her quickness and understanding, and said to the rhetorician, \"Doff thy clothes.\" So he rose up and cried, \"I call all who are present in this assembly to witness that she is more learned than I and every other learned man.\" And he put off his clothes and gave them to her, saying, \"Take them and may Allah not bless them to thee!\" So the Caliph ordered him fresh clothes and said, \"O Tawaddud, there is one thing left of that for which thou didst engage, namely, chess.\" And he sent for experts of chess and cards[FN#448] and trictrac. The chess-player sat down before her, and they set the pieces, and he moved and she moved; but, every move he made she speedily countered,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Sixty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damsel was playing chess with the expert in presence of the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, whatever move he made was speedily countered by her, till she beat him and he found himself checkmated. Quoth he, \"I did but lead thee on, that thou mightest think thyself skilful: but set up again, and thou shalt see.\" So they placed the pieces a second time, when he said in himself, \"Open thine eyes or she will beat thee.\" And he fell to moving no piece, save after calculation, and ceased not to play, till she said, \"Thy King is dead!\u2014Checkmate.\" When he saw this he was confounded at her quickness and understanding; but she laughed and said, \"O professor, I will make a wager with thee on this third game. I will give thee the queen and the right-hand castle and the left-hand knight; if thou beat me, take my clothes, and if I beat thee, I will take thy clothes.\" Replied he, \"I agree to this;\" and they replaced the pieces, she removing queen, castle and knight.[FN#449] Then said she, \"Move, O master.\" So he moved, saying to himself, \"I cannot but beat her, with such odds,\" and planned a combination; but, behold, she moved on, little by little, till she made one of her pawns[FN#450] a queen and pushing up to him pawns and other pieces, to take off his attention, set one in his way and tempted him to take it. Accordingly, he took it and she said to him, \"The measure is meted and the loads equally balanced.[FN#451] Eat till thou are over-full; naught shall be thy ruin, O son of Adam, save thy greed. Knowest thou not that I did but tempt thee, that I might finesse thee? See: this is check-mate!\" adding, \"So doff off thy clothes.\" Quoth he, \"Leave me my bag-trousers, so Allah repay thee;\" and he swore by Allah that he would contend with none, so long as Tawaddud abode in the realm of Baghdad. Then he stripped off his clothes and gave them to her and went away. Thereupon came the backgammon-player, and she said to him, \"If I beat thee, this day, what wilt thou give me?\" Quoth he, \"I will give thee ten suits of brocade of Constantinople, figured with gold, and ten suits of velvet and a thousand gold pieces; and if I beat thee, I ask nothing but that thou write me an acknowledgment of my victory.\" Quoth she, \"To it, then, and do thy best.\" So they played, and he lost and went away, chattering in Frankish jargon and saying, \"By the bounty of the Commander of the Faithful, there is not her like in all the regions of the world!\" Then the Caliph summoned players on instruments of music and asked her, \"Dost thou know aught of music?\"; when she answered, \"Even so!\" He bade bring a worn lute, polished by use, whose owner forlorn and lone was by parting trodden down; and of which quoth one, describing it\n\n\"Allah watered a land, and upsprang a tree * Struck root deep\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     down, and raised head a-sky:\nThe birds o'ersang it when green its wood; * And the Fair\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     o'ersing now the wood is dry.\"\n\nSo they brought the lute in a bag of red satin, with tassels of saffron-coloured silk: and she opened the bag, and took it out and behold on it was graven,\n\n\"Oft hath a tender bough made lute for maid, * whose swift sweet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     lays at feast men's hearts invade:\nShe sings; it follows on her song, as though * The\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Bulbuls[FN#452] taught her all the modes she played.\"\n\nShe laid her lute in her lap and with bosom inclining over it, bent to it with the bending of a mother who suckleth her child; then she preluded in twelve different modes, till the whole assembly was agitated with delight, like a waving sea, and she sang the following,\n\n\"Cut short this strangeness, leave unruth of you; * My heart\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     shall love you aye, by youth of you!\nHave ruth on one who sighs and weeps and moans, * Pining and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     yearning for the troth of you.\"\n\nThe Caliph was ravished and exclaimed, \"Allah bless thee and be merciful to him who taught thee!\": whereupon she rose and kissed the ground before him. Then he sent for money and paid her master Abu al-Husn an hundred thousand gold pieces to her price; after which he said to her, \"O Tawaddud, ask a boon of me!\" Replied she, \"I ask of thee that thou restore me to my lord who sold me.\" \"'Tis well,\" answered the Caliph and restored her to her master and gave her five thousand dinars for herself. Moreover, he appointed Abu al-Husn one of his cup-companions for a permanence,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Four Hundred and Sixty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph gave the damsel five thousand dinars for herself and restored her to her master whom he appointed one of his cup-companions for a permanence and assigned him a monthly stipend of a thousand dinars so long as he should live; and he abode with the damsel Tawaddud in all solace and delight of life. Marvel then, O King, at the eloquence of this damsel and the hugeness of her learning and understanding and her perfect excellence in all branches of art and science; and consider the generosity of the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, in that he gave her master this money and said to her, \"Ask a boon of me;\" and she besought him to restore her to her lord. So he restored her to him and gave her five thousand dinars for herself and made him one of his boon-companions. Where is such generosity to be found after the Abbaside Caliphs?\u2014May Allah Almighty have mercy upon them, one and all! And they tell a tale of\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n[FN#281] Lane (ii. 636) omits this tale, \"as it would not only require a volume of commentary but be extremely tiresome to most readers.\" Quite true; but it is valuable to Oriental Students who are beginning their studies, as an excellent compendium of doctrine and practice according to the Shafi'\u00ed School.\n\n[FN#282] Pronounced Aboo 'l-Husn = Father of Beauty, a fancy name.\n\n[FN#283] As in most hot climates so in Egypt the dead are buried at once despite the risk of vivisepulture. This seems an instinct with the Semitic (Arabian) race teste Abraham, as with the Gypsy. Hence the Moslems have invoked religious aid. The Mishk\u00e1t al-Mas\u00e1bih (i. 387) makes Mohammed say, \"When any one of you dieth you may not keep him in the house but bear him quickly to his grave\"; and again, \"Be quick in raising up the bier: for if the dead have been a good man, it is good to bear him gravewards without delay; and if bad, it is frowardness ye put from your necks.\"\n\n[FN#284] This biting of the hand in Al-Har\u00edri expresses bitterness of repentance and he uses more than once the Koranic phrase (chapter vii., 148) \"Sukita f\u00ed ayd\u00edhim,\" lit. where it (the biting) was fallen upon their hands; i.e. when it repented them; \"sukita\" being here not a passive verb as it appears, but an impersonal form uncommon in Arabic. The action is instinctive, a survival of the days when man was a snarling and snapping animal (physically) armed only with claws and teeth.\n\n[FN#285] Arab. \"'Alam,\" applied to many things, an \"old man\" of stones (K\u00e1k\u00far), a signpost with a rag on the top, etc.\n\n[FN#286] The moon of Ramazan was noticed in Night ix. That of Sha'aban (eighth month) begins the fighting month after the conclusion of the Treuga Dei in Rajab. See Night ccclxxviii.\n\n[FN#287] These lines have occurred in Night cccxix. I give Mr.\nPayne's version for variety.\n\n[FN#288] i.e. in her prime, at fourteen to fifteen.\n\n[FN#289] i.e. pale and yellow.\n\n[FN#290] The word means the wood; but it alludes to a preparation made by levigating it on a stone called in India \"Sandl\u00e1s\u00e1.\" The gruel-like stuff is applied with the right hand to the right side of the neck, drawing the open fingers from behind forwards so as to leave four distinct streaks, then down to the left side, and so on to the other parts of the body.\n\n[FN#291] Arab. \"Haykal\" which included the Porch, the Holy and\nthe Holy of Holies. The word is used as in a wider sense by\nJosephus A. J. v. v. 3. In Moslem writings it is applied to a\nChristian Church generally, on account of its images.\n\n[FN#292] These lines having occurred before, I here quote Mr.\nPayne.\n\n[FN#293] Arab writers often mention the smile of beauty, but rarely, after European fashion, the laugh, which they look upon as undignified. A Moslem will say \"Don't guffaw (Kahkahah) in that way; leave giggling and grinning to monkeys and Christians.\" The Spaniards, a grave people, remark that Christ never laughed. I would draw the reader's attention to a theory of mine that the open-hearted laugh has the sound of the vowels a and o; while e, i, and u belong to what may be roughly classed as the rogue order.\n\n[FN#294] i.e. gaining the love of another, love.\n\n[FN#295] i.e. the abrogated passages and those by which they are abrogated. This division is necessary for \"inspired volumes,\" which always abound in contradictions. But the charge of \"opportunism\" brought against the Koran is truly absurd; as if \"revelation\" could possibly be aught save opportune.\n\n[FN#296] Koran iv. 160, the chapter \"Women.\"\n\n[FN#297] She unveiled, being a slave-girl and for sale. If a free woman show her face to a Moslem, he breaks out into violent abuse, because the act is intended to let him know that he is looked upon as a small boy or an eunuch or a Chriastian\u2014in fact not a man.\n\n[FN#298] Ilah=Heb. El, a most difficult root, meaning strength, interposition, God (Numen) \"the\" (article) \"don't\" (do not), etc. etc.\n\n[FN#299] As far as I know Christians are the only worshippers who kneel as if their lower legs were cut off and who \"join hands\" like the captive offering his wrists to be bound (dare manus). The posture, however, is not so ignoble as that of the Moslem \"Sijdah\" (prostration) which made certain North African tribes reject Al-Islam saying, \"These men show their hind parts to heaven.\"\n\n[FN#300] i.e. saying \"I intend (purpose) to pray (for instance) the two-bow prayer (ruka'tayn) of the day-break,\" etc.\n\n[FN#301] So called because it prohibits speaking with others till the prayer is ended.\n\n[FN#302] Lit. \"any thing opposite;\" here used for the Ka'abah towards which men turn in prayer; as Guebres face the sun or fire and idolators their images. \"Al-Kiblatayn\" (= the two Kiblahs) means Meccah and Jerusalem, which was faced by Moslems as well as Jews and Christians till Mohammed changed the direction. For the occasion of the change see my Pilgrimage, ii. 320.\n\n[FN#303] Which includes Tayammum or washing with sand. This is a very cleanly practice in a hot, dry land and was adopted long before Mohammed. Cedrenus tells of baptism with sand being administered to a dying traveller in the African desert.\n\n[FN#304] The Koranic order for Wuz\u00fa is concise and as usual obscure, giving rise to a host of disputes and casuistical questions. Its text runs (chapt. v.), \"O true believers, when you prepare to pray, wash (Ghusl) your faces, and your hands unto the elbows; and rub (Mas-h) your hands and your feet unto the ankles; and if ye be unclean by having lain with a woman, wash (Ghusl) yourselves all over.\" The purifications and ceremonious ablutions of the Jews originated this command; and the early Christians did very unwisely in not making the bath obligatory. St. Paul (Heb. xi. 22) says, \"Let us draw near with a true heart\u2026having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with clean (or pure) water.\" But this did not suffice. Hence the Eastern Christian, in hot climates where cleanliness should rank before godliness, is distinguished by his dirt which as a holy or reverend man he makes still dirtier, and he offers an ugly comparison with the Moslem and especially the Hindu. The neglect of commands to wash and prohibitions to drink strong waters are the two grand physical objections of the Christian code of morality.\n[FN#305] Arab. \"Istinsh\u00e1k\"=snuffing up water from the palm of the right hand so as to clean thoroughly the nostrils. This \"function\" is unreasonably neglected in Europe, to the detriment of the mucous membrane and the olfactory nerves.\n\n[FN#306] So as to wash between them. The thick beard is combed out with the fingers.\n\n[FN#307] Poor human nature! How sad to compare ita pretensions with its actualities.\n\n[FN#308] Complete ablution is rendered necessary chiefly by the emission of semen either in copulation or in nocturnal pollution. The water must be pure and not less than a certain quantity, and it must touch every part of the skin beginning with the right half of the person and ending with the left. Hence a plunge-bath is generally preferred.\n\n[FN#309] Arab. \"Ta'm\u00edm,\" lit. crowning with turband, or tiara, here=covering, i.e. wetting.\n\n[FN#310] This practice (saying \"I purpose to defer the washing of the feet,\" etc.) is now somewhat obsolete.\n\n[FN#311] Arabs have a prejudice against the hydropathic treatment of wounds, holding that water poisons them: and, as the native produce usually contains salt, soda and magnesia, they are justified by many cases. I once tried water-bandages in Arabia and failed dismally.\n\n[FN#312] The sick man says his prayers lying in bed, etc., and as he best can.\n\n[FN#313] i.e. saying, \"And peace be on us and on the worshippers of Allah which be pious.\"\n\n[FN#314] i.e. saying, \" I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the\nStoned.\"\n\n[FN#315] Certain parts should be recited aloud (jahr) and others sotto voce (with mussitation=Khafi). No mistake must be made in this matter where a Moslem cannot err.\n\n[FN#316] Hence an interest of two-and-a-half percent is not held to be \"Rib\u00e1\" or unlawful gain of money by money, usury.\n\n[FN#317] The meal must be finished before the faster can plainly distinguish the white thread from the black thread (Koran ii. 183); some understand this literally, others apply it to the dark and silvery streak of zodiacal light which appears over the Eastern horizon an hour or so before sunrise. The fast then begins and ends with the disappearance of the sun. I have noticed its pains and penalties in my Pilgrimage, i. 110, etc.\n\n[FN#318] For the \"Az\u00e1n\" or call to prayer see Lane, M. E., chapt. xviii. The chant, however, differs in every country, and a practical ear will know the land by its call.\n\n[FN#319] Arab. \"Had\u00eds\" or saying of the Apostle.\n\n[FN#320] \"Al-I'itikaf\" resembles the Christian \"retreat;\" but the worshipper generally retires to a mosque, especially in Meccah. The Apostle practised it on Jabal Hira and other places.\n\n[FN#321] The word is the Heb. \"Hagg\" whose primary meaning is circularity of form or movement. Hence it applied to religious festivals in which dancing round the idol played a prime part; and Lucian of \"saltation\" says, dancing was from the beginning and coeval with the ancient god, Love. But man danced with joy before he worshipped, and, when he invented a systematic saltation, he made it represent two things, and only two things, love and war, in most primitive form, courtship and fighting.\n\n[FN#322] Two adjoining ground-waves in Meccah. For these and for the places subsequently mentioned the curious will consult my Pilgrimage, iii. 226, etc.\n\n[FN#323] The 'Umrah or lesser Pilgrimage, I have noted, is the ceremony performed in Meccah at any time out of the pilgrim-season proper, i.e. between the eighth and tenth days of the twelfth lunar month Zu 'l-Hijjah. It does not entitle the Moslem to be called H\u00e1jj (pilgrim) or H\u00e1j\u00ed as Persians and Indians corrupt the word.\n\n[FN#324] I need hardly note that Mohammed borrowed his pilgrimage-practices from the pagan Arabs who, centuries before his day, danced around the Meccan Ka'abah. Nor can he be blamed for having perpetuated a Gentile rite, if indeed it be true that the Ka'abah contained relics of Abraham and Ishmael.\n\n[FN#325] On first sighting Meccah. See Night xci.\n\n[FN#326] Arab. \"Taw\u00e1f:\" the place is called Mat\u00e1f and the guide Mutawwif. (Pilgrimage, iii. 193, 205.) The seven courses are termed Ashw\u00e1t.\n\n[FN#327] Stoning the Devil at Mina. (Pilgrimage, iii. 282.) Hence\nSatan's title \"the Stoned\" (lapidated not castrated).\n\n[FN#328] Koran viii. 66; in the chapter entided \"Spoil,\" and relating mainly to the \"day of Al-Bedr.\n\n[FN#329] Arab. \"AI-Ik\u00e1lah\"= cancelling: Mr. Payne uses the technical term \"resiliation.\"\n\n[FN#330] Freedman of Abdallah, son of the Caliph Omar and noted as a traditionist.\n\n[FN#331] i.e. at a profit: the exchange must be equal\u2014an ordinance intended to protect the poor. Arabs have strange prejudices in these matters; for instance it disgraces a Badawi to take money for milk.\n\n[FN#332] Arab. \"Jam\u00e1'ah,\" which in theology means the Greek , our \"Church,\" the congregation of the Faithful under a lawful head. Hence the Sunnis call themselves \"People of the Sunnat and Jam\u00e1'at.\" In the text it is explained as \"Ulfat\" or intimacy.\n\n[FN#333] Arab. \"Al-Khal\u00edl,\" i.e. of Allah=Abraham. Mohammed, following Jewish tradition, made Abraham rank second amongst the Prophets, inferior only to himself and superior to Hazrat Isa=Jesus. I have noted that Ishmael the elder son succeeded his father. He married Da'alah bint Muz\u00e1z bin Omar, a Jurhamite, and his progeny abandoning Hebrew began to speak Arabic (ta'arraba); hence called Muta'arribah or Arabised Arabs. (Pilgrimage iii. 190.) He died at Meccah and was buried with his mother in the space North of the Ka'abah called Al-Hijr which our writers continue to confuse with the city Al-Hijr. (Ibid. 165-66.)\n\n[FN#334] This ejaculation, \"In the name of Allah\" is, I have noted, equivalent to \"saying grace.\" If neglected it is a sin and entails a curse.\n\n[FN#335] The ceremonious posture is sitting upon the shin-bones, not tailor-fashion; and \"bolting food\" is a sign of boorishness.\n\n[FN#336] Arab. \"Zidd,\" the word is a fair specimen of Arabic ambiguity meaning primarily opposite or contrary (as virtue to vice), secondarily an enemy or a friend (as being opposite to an enemy).\n\n[FN#337] \"The whole earth (shall be) but His handful on the Resurrection day and in His right hand shall the Heaven be rolled up (or folded together).\"-Koran xxxix. 67.\n\n[FN#338] See Night lxxxi.\n\n[FN#339] Koran lxxviii. 19.\n\n[FN#340] Arab. \"Al-Mun\u00e1fik,\" technically meaning one who outwardly professes Al-Islam while inwardly hating it. Thus the word is by no means synonymous with our \"hypocrite,\" hypocrisy being the homage vice pays to virtue; a homage, I may observe, nowhere rendered more fulsomely than among the so-called Anglo-Saxon race.\n\n[FN#341] Arab. \"Tawakkul al\u00e1 'llah\": in the imperative the phrase is vulgarly used=\"Be off!\"\n\n[FN#342] i.e. ceremonial impurity which is sui generis, a very different thing from general dirtiness.\n\n[FN#343] A thick beard is one which does not show the skin; otherwise the wearer is a \"Kausaj;\" in Pers. \"K\u00faseh.\" See vol. iii., 246.\n\n[FN#344] Arab. \"Al-Khutnah.\" Nowhere commanded in the Koran and being only a practice of the Prophet, the rite is not indispensable for converts, especially the aged and the sick. Our ideas upon the subject are very hazy, for modern \"niceness\" allows a \"Feast of the Circumcision,\" but no discussion thereon. Moses (alias Osarsiph) borrowed the rite from the Egyptian hierophants who were all thus \"purified\"; the object being to counteract the over-sensibility of the \"sixth sense\" and to harden the glans against abrasions and infection by exposure to air and friction against the dress. Almost all African tribes practise it but the modes vary and some are exceedingly curious: I shall notice a peculiarly barbarous fashion called Al-Salkh (the flaying) still practised in the Arabian province Al-As\u00edr. (Pilgrimage iii. 80.) There is a difference too between the Hebrew and the Moslem rite. The Jewish operator, after snipping off the foreskin, rips up the prepuce with his sharp thumb-nails so that the external cutis does not retract far from the internal; and the wound, when healed, shows a narrow ring of cicatrice. This ripping is not done by Moslems. They use a stick as a probe passed round between glans and prepuce to ascertain the extent of the frenum and that there is no abnormal adhesion. The foreskin is then drawn forward and fixed by the forceps, a fork of two bamboo splints, five or six inches long by a quarter thick, or in some cases an iron like our compasses. This is tied tightly over the foreskin so as to exclude about an inch and a half of the prepuce above and three quarters below. A single stroke of the razor drawn directly downwards removes the skin. The slight bleeding is stopped by burnt rags or ashes and healed with cerates, pledgets and fumigations. Thus Moslem circumcision does not prevent the skin retracting.\n\n[FN#345] Of these 6336 versets only some 200 treat on law, civil and ceremonial, fiscal and political, devotional and ceremonial, canonical and ecclesiastical.\n\n[FN#346] The learned young woman omitted Ukhn\u00fakh=Enoch, because not in Koran; and if she denoted him by \"Idr\u00eds,\" the latter is much out of place.\n\n\n[FN#347] Some say grandson of Shem. (Koran vii. 71.)\n\n[FN#348] Koran vii. 63, etc.\n\n[FN#349] Father-in-law of Moses. (Koran vii. 83.)\n\n[FN#350] Who is the last and greatest of the twenty-five.\n\n[FN#351] See Night ccccxxxviii.\n\n[FN#352] Koran ii., whose 256th Ayah is the far-famed and sublime Throne-verse which begins \"Allah! there is no god but He, the Living, the Eternal One, whom nor slumber nor sleep seizeth on!\" The trivial name is taken from the last line, \"His throne overstretcheth Heaven and Earth and to Him their preservation is no burden for He is the most Highest, the Supreme.\" The lines are often repeated in prayers and engraved on agates, etc., as portable talismans.\n\n[FN#353] Koran ii. 159.\n\n[FN#354] Koran xvi. 92. The verset ends with, \"He warneth you, so haply ye may be mindful.\"\n\n[FN#355] Koran lxx. 38.\n\n[FN#356] Koran xxxix. 54.\n[FN#357] The Sunnis hold that the \"Anbiy\u00e1\" (=prophets, or rather announcers of Allah's judgments) were not sinless. But this dogma is branded as most irreverent and sinful by the Shi'ahs or Persian \"followers of Ali,\" who make capital out of this blasphemy and declare that if any prophet sinned he sinned only against himself.\n\n\n[FN#358] Koran xii. 18.\n\n[FN#359] Koran ii. 107.\n\n[FN#360] Koran ii. 57. He (Allah) does not use the plurale majestatis.\n\n[FN#361] Koran ii. 28.\n\n[FN#362] Koran xvi. 100. Satan is stoned in the Min\u00e1 or Mun\u00e1 basin (Night ccccxlii.) because he tempted Abraham to disobey the command of Allah by refusing to sacrifice Ishmael. (Pilgrimage iii. 248.)\n\n[FN#363] It may also mean \"have recourse to God.\"\n\n[FN#364] Abdallah ibn Abbas, before noticed, first cousin of\nMohammed and the most learned of the Companions. See D'Herbelot.\n\n[FN#365] Koran xcvi., \"Blood-clots,\" 1 and 2. \"Read\" may mean \"peruse the revelation\" (it was the first Koranic chapter communicated to Mohammed), or \"recite, preach.\"\n\n[FN#366] Koran xxvii. 30. Mr. Rodwell (p.1) holds to the old idea that the \"Basmalah\" is of Jewish origin, taught to the Kuraysh by Omayyah, of Taif, the poet and Han\u00edf (convert).\n\n[FN#367] Koran ix.: this was the last chapter revealed and the only one revealed entire except verse 110.\n\n[FN#368] Ali was despatched from Al-Medinah to Meccah by the Prophet on his own slit-eared camel to promulgate this chapter; and meeting the assembly at Al-'Akabah he also acquainted them with four things; (1) No Infidel may approach the Meccah temple; (2) naked men must no longer circut the Ka'abah; (3) only Moslems enter Paradise, and (4) public faith must be kept.\n\n[FN#369] Dictionaries give the word \"Basmalah\" (=saying\nBismillah); but the common pronunciation is \"Bismalah.\"\n\n[FN#370] Koran xvii. 110, a passage revealed because the Infidels, hearing Mohammed calling upon The Compassionate, imagined that Al-Rahm\u00e1n was other deity but Allah. The \"names\" have two grand divisions, Asm\u00e1 Jal\u00e1l\u00ed, the fiery or terrible attributes, and the Asm\u00e1 Jam\u00e1l\u00ed (airy, watery, earthy or) amiable. Together they form the Asm\u00e1 al-Husna or glorious attributes, and do not include the Ism al-A'azam, the ineffable name which is known only to a few.\n\n[FN#371] Koran ii. 158.\n\n\n[FN#372] Koran xcvi. before noticed.\n\n[FN#373] A man of Al-Medinah, one of the first of Mohammed's disciples.\n\n[FN#374] Koran lxxiv. 1, etc., supposed to have been addressed by Gabriel to Mohammed when in the cave of Hira or Jabal N\u00far. He returned to his wife Khadijah in sore terror at the vision of one sitting on a throne between heaven and earth, and bade her cover him up. Whereupon the Archangel descended with this text, supposed to be the first revealed. Mr. Rodwell (p. 3) renders it, \"O thou enwrapped in thy mantle!\" and makes it No. ii. after a Fatrah or silent interval of six months to three years.\n\n[FN#375] There are several versets on this subject (chapts. ii. and xxx.)\n\n[FN#376] Koran cx. 1.\n\n[FN#377] The third Caliph; the \"Writer of the Koran.\"\n\n[FN#378] Koran, v. 4. Sale translates \"idols.\" Mr. Rodwell, \"On the blocks (or shafts) of Stone,\" rude altars set by the pagan Arabs before their dwellings.\n\n[FN#379] Koran, v. 116. The words are put into the mouth of\nJesus.\n\n[FN#380] The end of the same verse.\n\n[FN#381] Koran, v. 89. Supposed to have been revealed when certain Moslems purposed to practise Christian asceticism, fasting, watching, abstaining from women and sleeping on hard beds. I have said Mohammed would have \"no monkery in Al-Islam,\" but human nature willed otherwise. Mr. Rodwell prefers \"Interdict the healthful viands.\"\n\n[FN#382] Koran, iv. 124.\n\n[FN#383] Arab. \"Mukri.\" \"K\u00e1ri\" is one who reads the Koran to pupils; the Mukri corrects them. \"With the passage of the clouds\" = without a moment's hesitation.\n\n[FN#384] The twenty-first, twenty-fourth and eighteenth Arabic letters.\n\n[FN#385] Arab. \"Hizb.\" The Koran is divided into sixty portions, answering to \"Lessons\" for convenience of public worship.\n\n[FN#386] Arab. \"Jal\u00e1lah,\"=saying Jalla Jal\u00e1lu-hu=magnified be His\nMajesty!, or glorified be His Glory.\n\n[FN#387] Koran, xi. 50.\n\n[FN#388] The partition-wall between Heaven and Hell which others call Al-'Urf (in the sing. from the verb meaning he separated or parted). The Jews borrowed from the Guebres the idea of a partition between Heaven and Hell and made it so thin that the blessed and damned can speak together. There is much dispute about the population of Al-A'ar\u00e1f, the general idea being that they are men who do not deserve reward in Heaven or punishment in Hell. But it is not a \"Purgatory\" or place of expiating sins.\n\n[FN#389] Koran, vii. 154.\n\n[FN#390] A play on the word ayn, which means \"eye\" or the eighteenth letter which in olden times had the form of a circle.\n\n[FN#391] From misreading these words comes the absurd popular belief of the moon passing up and down Mohammed's sleeves. George B. Airy (The Athen\u00e6um, Nov.29, 1884) justly objects to Sale's translation \"The hour of judgment approacheth\" and translates \"The moon hath been dichotomised\" a well-known astronomical term when the light portion of the moon is defined in a strait line: in other words when it is really a half-moon at the first and third quarters of each lunation. Others understand, The moon shall be split on the Last Day, the preterite for the future in prophetic style. \"Koran Moslems\" of course understand it literally.\n\n[FN#392] Chapters liv., lv. and lvi.\n\n\n\n[FN#393] We should say, not to utter, etc.\n\n[FN#394] These well-known \"humours of Hippocrates,\" which reappear in the form of temperaments of European phrenology, are still the base of Eastern therapeutics.\n\n[FN#395] The doctrine of the three souls will be intelligible to\nSpiritualists.\n\n[FN#396] Arab. \"Al-l\u00e1mi\"=the l-shaped, curved, forked.\n\n[FN#397] Arab. \"Usus,\" our os sacrum because, being incorruptible, the body will be built up thereon for Resurrection-time. Hence Hudibras sings (iii. 2),\n\n\"The learned Rabbis of the Jews\nWrite there's a bone which they call leuz,\nI' the rump of man, etc.\"\n\nIt is the Heb. \"Uz,\" whence older scholars derived os. Sale (sect. iv.) called it \"El Ajb, os coccygis or rump-bone.\"\n[FN#398] Arab physiologists had difficulties in procuring \"subjects\"; and usually practised dissection on the simiads. Their illustrated books are droll; the figures have been copied and recopied till they have lost all resemblance to the originals.\n\n[FN#399] The liver and spleen are held to be congealed blood.\nHence the couplet,\n\n\"We are allowed two carrions (i.e. with throats uncut) and\ntwo bloods,\nThe fish and the locust, the liver and the spleen.\"\n(Pilgrimage iii. 92.)\n\n[FN#400] This is perfectly true and yet little known to the general.\n\n[FN#401] Koran xvii. 39.\n\n[FN#402] Arab. \"Al-malikhul\u00edya,\" proving that the Greeks then pronounced the penultimate vowel according to the acute accent\u00eda; not as we slur it over. In old Hebrew we have the transliteration of four Greek words; in the languages of Hindostan many scores including names of places; and in Latin and Arabic as many hundreds. By a scholar-like comparison of these remains we should find little difficulty in establishing the true Greek pronunciation since the days of Alexander the Great; and we shall prove that it was pronounced according to accent and emphatically not quantity. In the next century I presume English boys will be taught to pronounce Greek as the Greeks do.\n\n[FN#403] Educated Arabs can quote many a verse bearing upon domestic medicine and reminding us of the lines bequeathed to Europe by the School of Salerno. Such e.g. are;\n\n\"After the noon-meal, sleep, although for moments twain;\nAfter the night-meal, walk, though but two steps be ta'en;\nAnd after swiving stale, though but two drops thou drain.\"\n\n[FN#404] Arab. \"Sar\u00eddah\" (Thar\u00eddah), also called \"ghaut\"=crumbled bread and hashed meat in broth; or bread, milk and meat. The Sar\u00eddah of Ghass\u00e1n, cooked with eggs and marrow, was held a dainty dish: hence the Prophet's dictum.\n\n[FN#405] Koran v. 92. \"Lots\"=games of chance and \"images\"=statues.\n\n[FN#406] Koran ii. 216. The word \"Maysar\" which I have rendered \"gambling\" or gaming (for such is the modern application of the word), originally meant what St. Jerome calls and explains thereby the verse (Ezek. xxi. 22), \"The King held in his hand the lot of Jerusalem\" i.e. the arrow whereon the city-name was written. The Arabs use it for casting lots with ten azlam or headless arrows (for dice) three being blanks and the rest notched from one to seven. They were thrown by a \"Z\u00e1rib\" or punter and the stake was generally a camel. Amongst so excitable a people as the Arabs, this game caused quarrels and bloodshed, hence its prohibition: and the theologians, who everywhere and at all times delight in burdening human nature, have extended the command, which is rather admonitory than prohibitive, to all games of chance. Tarafah is supposed to allude to this practice in his Mu'allakah.\n\n[FN#407] Liberal Moslems observe that the Koranic prohibition is not absolute, with threat of Hell for infraction. Yet Mohammed doubtless forbade all inebriatives and the occasion of his so doing is well known. (Pilgrimage ii. 322.)\n\n[FN#408] I have noticed this soured milk in Pilgrimage i. 362.\n\n[FN#409] He does not say the \"Caliph\" or successor of his uncle\nMohammed.\n\n[FN#410] The Jewish Korah (Numbers xvi.) fabled by the Koran (xxviii. 76), following a Talmudic tradition, to have been a man of immense wealth. The notion that lying with an old woman, after the menses have ceased, is unwholesome, dates from great antiquity; and the benefits of the reverse process were well known to good King David. The faces of children who sleep with their grandparents (a bad practice now waxing obsolete in England), of a young wife married to an old man and of a young man married to an old woman, show a peculiar wizened appearance, a look of age overlaying youth which cannot be mistaken.\n\n[FN#411] Arab. \"Hindib\u00e1\"(=endubium): the modern term is\nShakur\u00edyah=chicor\u00e9e. I believe it to be very hurtful to the eyes.\n\n[FN#412] Arab. \"Khuff\u00e1sh\" and \"Watw\u00e1t\": in Egypt a woman is called \"Watw\u00e1t\u00edyah\" when the hair of her privities has been removed by applying bats' blood. I have often heard of this; but cannot understand how such an application can act depilatory.\n\n[FN#413] Dictionaries render the word by \"dragon, cockatrice.\" The Badawin apply it to a variety of serpents mostly large and all considered venomous.\n\n[FN#414] Arab. \"Zarr wa 'urwah,\" 1it.=handle. The button-hole, I have said, is a modern invention; Urwah is also applied to the loopshaped handle of the water-skin, for attachment of the All\u00e1kah or suspensory thong.\n\n[FN#415] Koran lxx. 40; see also the chapter following, v. 16.\n\n[FN#416] Koran x. 5; the \"her\" refers to the sun.\n\n[FN#417] Koran xxxvi. 40.\n\n[FN#418] Koran xxii. 60.\n\n[FN#419] Arab. \"Man\u00e1zil:\" these are the Hindu \"Nakshatra\"; extensively used in meteorology even by Europeans unconsciously: thus they will speak of the Elephantina-storm without knowing anything of the lunar mansion so called. The names in the text are successively Sharat\u00e1n=two horns of the Ram; (2) the Ram's belly; (3) the Pleiades; (4) Aldebaran; (5) three stars in Orion's head; (6) ditto in Orion's shoulder; (7) two stars above the Twins; (8) Lion's nose and first summer station; (9) Lion's eye; (1O) Lion's forehead; (11) Lion's mane; (12) Lion's heart; (13) the Dog, two stars in Virgo; (14) Spica Virginis; (15) foot of Virgo; (16) horns of Scorpio; (17) the Crown; (18) heart of Scorpio; (19) tail of Scorpio; (2O) stars in Pegasus; (21) where no constellation appears; (22) the Slaughterer's luck; (23) Glutton's luck; (24) Luck of Lucks, stars in Aquarius; (25) Luck of Tents, stars in Aquarius; (26) the fore-lip or spout of Urn; (27) hind lip of Urn; and (28) in navel of Fish's belly (Batn al-H\u00fat); of these 28, to each of the four seasons 7 are allotted.\n\n[FN#420] The Hebrew absey, still used by Moslems in chronograms. For mnemonic purposes the 28 letters are distributed into eight words of which the first and second are Abjad and Hawwaz. The last six letters in two words (Thakhiz and Zuzigh) are Arabian, unknown to the Jews and not found in Syriac.\n\n[FN#421] Arab. \"Zind\u00edk;\" properly, one who believes in two gods (the old Persian dualism); in books an atheist, i.e. one who does not believe in a god or gods; and, popularly, a free-thinker who denies the existence of a Supreme Being, rejects revelation for the laws of Nature imprinted on the heart of man and for humanity in its widest sense. Hence he is accused of permitting incestuous marriages and other abominations. We should now call him (for want of something better) an Agnostic.\n\n[FN#422] Koran xxxi. 34. The words may still be applied to meteorologists especially of the scientific school. Even the experienced (as the followers of the late Mathieu de la Dr\u00f4me) reckon far more failures than successes. The Koranic passage enumerates five things known only to Allah; Judgment-day; rain; sex of child in womb; what shall happen to-morrow and where a man shall die.\n\n[FN#423] The fifth and seventh months (January and March) of the Coptic year which, being solar, is still used by Arab and Egyptian meteorologists. Much information thereon will be found in the \"Egyptian Calendar\" by Mr. Mitchell, Alexandria, 1876. It bears the appropriate motto \"Anni certus modus apud solos semper Egyptios fuit.\" (Macrobius.) See also Lane M.E., chapt. ix.\n\n[FN#424] Vulg. Kiy\u00e1k; the fourth month, beginning 9th\u20141Oth\nDecember. The first month is T\u00fat, commencing 1Oth\u201411th\nSeptember.\n\n[FN#425] The 8th and 12th months partly corresponding with April and August: H\u00e1t\u00far is the 3rd (November) and AmshRr the 6th (February).\n\n[FN#426] Moslems have been compelled to adopt infidel names for the months because Mohammed's Koranic rejection of Nasy or intercalation makes their lunar months describe the whole circle of the seasons in a cycle of about thirty-three and a half years. Yet they have retained the terms which contain the original motive of the denomination. The first month is Muharram, the \"Holy,\" because war was forbidden; it was also known as Safar No. 1. The second Safar=\"Emptiness,\" because during the heats citizens left the towns and retired to T\u00e1if and other cool sites. Rab\u00ed'a (first and second) alluded to the spring-pasturages; Jum\u00e1d\u00e1 (first and second) to the \"hardening\" of the dry ground and, according to some, to the solidification, freezing, of the water in the highlands. Rajab (No.7)=\"worshipping,\" especially by sacrifice, is also known as Al-Asamm the deaf; because being sacred, the rattle of arms was unheard. Sha'ab\u00e1n=\"collecting,\" dispersing, ruining, because the tribal wars recommenced: Ramazan (intensely hot) has been explained and Shaww\u00e1l (No. 10) derives from Shaul (elevating) when the he-camels raise their tails in rut. Z\u00fa'l-Ka'adah, the sedentary, is the rest time of the year, when fighting is forbidden and Zu'l-Hijjah explains itself as the pilgrimage-month.\n[FN#427] The lowest of the seven.\n[FN#428] Koran xxxvii. 5.\n[FN#429] Arab. \"Faylas\u00faf,\" an evident corruption from the Greek. Amongst the vulgar it denotes a sceptic, an atheist; much the same a \"Framm\u00e1s\u00fan\" or Freemason. The curious reader will consult the Dabistan, vol. iii. chapt. xi. p. 138 et seq. \"On the Religion of the Wise\" (philosophi), and, Beaconsfield's theft from Shaftesbury.\n\n[FN#430] Koran xxxvi. 37-38.\n\n[FN#431] Koran xxii. 7. The Hour i.e. of Judgment.\n\n[FN#432] Koran xx. 58. The Midrasch Tanchumah on Exod. vii. gives a similar dialogue between Pharaoh and Moses. (Rodwell, in loco.)\n\n[FN#433] Arab. \"Sham'\u00fan\" or \"Shim'\u00fan,\" usually applied to Simon\nPeter (as in Acts xv. 14). But the text alludes to Saint Simeon\n(Luke ii. 25-35). See Gospel of Infancy (ii. 8) and especially\nthe Gospel of Nicodemus (xii. 3) which makes him a High-Priest.\n\n[FN#434] S\u00e1lih the Patriarch's she-camel, miraculously produced from the rock in order to convert the Tham\u00fad-tribe. (Koran vii.)\n\n[FN#435] When Abu Bakr was hiding with Mohammed in a cave on the Hill Al-Saur (Thaur or Th\u00far, Pilgrimage ii. 131) South of Meccah, which must not be confounded with the cave on Jabal Hir\u00e1 now called Jabal N\u00far on the way to Arafat (Pilgrimage iii. 246), the fugitives were protected by a bird which built her nest at the entrance (according to another legend it was curtained by a spider's web), whilst another bird (the crow of whom I shall presently speak) tried to betray them. The first bird is popularly supposed to have been a pigeon, and is referred to by Hudibras,\n\n\"Th' apostles of this fierce religion\nLike Mahomet, were ass and widgeon.\"\n\nThe ass I presume alludes to the marvellous beast Al-Bur\u00e1k which the Greeks called from (Euthymius in Pocock, Spec. A.H. p.144) and which Indian Moslems picture with human face, ass's ears, equine body and peacock's wings and tail. The \"widgeon\" I presume to be a mistake or a misprint for pigeon.\n\n[FN#436] The Arabs are not satisfied with the comparative moderation of the Hebrew miracle, and have added all manner of absurdities. (Pilgrimage ii. 288.)\n\n[FN#437] Koran lxxxi. 18. Sale translates \"by the morning when it appeareth;\" and the word (tanaffus) will bear this meaning. Mr. Rodwell prefers, \"By the dawn when it clears away the darkness by its breath.\"\n\n[FN#438] As a rule Moslems are absurdly ignorant of arithmetic and apparently cannot master it. Hence in Egypt they used Copts for calculating-machines and further East Hindds. The mildest numerical puzzle, like the above, is sure of success.\n\n[FN#439] The paradiseal tree which supplied every want. Mohammed borrowed it from the Christians (Rev. xxi. 10-21 and xxii. 1-2) who placed in their paradise the Tree of Life which bears twelve sorts of fruits and leaves of healing virtue. (See also the 3rd book of Hermas, his Similitudes.) The Hebrews borrowed it from the Persians. Amongst the Hindus it appears as \"Kalpavriksha;\" amongst the Scandinavians as Yggdrasil. The curious reader will consult Mr. James Fergusson's learned work, \"Tree and Serpent Worship,\" etc. London, 1873.\n\n[FN#440] Aaron's Rod becomes amongst Moslems (Koran vii. 110) Moses' Staff; the size being that of a top-mast. (Pilgrimage i. 300, 301.) In Koran xx. 18, 19, we find a notice of its uses; and during the Middle Ages it reappeared in the Staff of Wamba the Goth (A.D.672-680) the witch's broomstick was its latest development.\n\n[FN#441] Christ, say the Eutychians, had only one nature, the divine; so he was crucified in effigy.\n\n[FN#442] Jesus is compared with Adam in the Koran (chapt. iii.): his titles are Kal\u00e1mu 'llah (word of God) because engendered without a father, and R\u00fahu 'llah (breath of God) because conceived by Gabriel in the shape of a beautifui youth breathing into the Virgin's vulva. Hence Moslems believe in a \"miraculous conception\" and consequently determine that one so conceived was, like Elias and Khizr, not subject to death; they also hold him born free from \"original sin\" (a most sinful superstition), a veil being placed before the Virgin and Child against the Evil One who could not touch them. He spoke when a babe in cradle; he performed miracles of physic; he was taken up to Heaven; he will appear as the forerunner of Mohammed on the White Tower of Damascus, and finally he will be buried at Al-Medinah. The Jews on the other hand speak of him as \"that man:\" they hold that he was begotten by Joseph during the menstrual period and therefore a born magician. Moreover he learned the Sham ha-maphrash or Nomen tetragrammaton, wrote it on parchment and placed it in an incision in his thigh, which closed up on the Name being mentioned (Buxtorf, Lex Talmud, 25-41). Other details are given in the Toldoth Jesu (Historia Joshu\u00e6 Nazareni). This note should be read by the eminent English litt\u00e9rateur who discovered a fact, well known to Locke and Carlyle, that \"Mohammedans are Christians.\" So they are and something more.\n[FN#443] In the Kalamd\u00e1n, or pen-case, is a little inkstand of metal occupying the top of the long, narrow box.\n\n[FN#444] A fair specimen of the riddle known as the \"surprise.\"\n\n[FN#445] Koran xli. 10.\n\n[FN#446] Koran xxxvi. 82.\n\n[FN#447] Here we enter upon a series of disputed points. The Wahh\u00e1bis deny the intercession of the Apostle (Pilgrimage ii. 76-77). The Shi'ahs place Ali next in dignity to Mohammed and there is a sect (Ali-Il\u00e1hi) which believes him to be an Avatar or incarnation of the Deity. For the latter the curious reader will consult the \"Dabistan,\" ii. 451. The Koran by its many contradictions seems to show that Mohammed never could make up his own mind on the subject, thinking himself at times an intercessor and then sharply denying all intercession.\n\n[FN#448] Arab. \"Kanjifah\"=a pack of cards; corrupted from the Persian \"Ganj\u00edfah.\" We know little concerning the date or origin of this game in the East, where the packs are quite unlike ours.\n\n[FN#449] It is interesting to compare this account with the pseudo Ovid and with Tale clxvi. in Gesta \"Of the game of Schaci.\" Its Schacarium is the chess-board. Rochus (roccus, etc.) is not from the Germ. Rock (a coat) but from Rukh (Pers. a hero, a knight-errant) Alphinus (Ital. Alfino) is Al-Firz\u00e1n (Pers. science, wise).\n\n[FN#450] Arab, \"Baydak\" or \"Bayzak\"; a corruption of the Persian \"Piy\u00e1dah\"=a footman, peon, pawn; and proving whence the Arabs derived the game. The Persians are the readiest backgammon-players known to me, better even than the Greeks; they throw the dice from the hand and continue foully abusing the fathers and mothers of the \"bones\" whilst the game lasts. It is often played in the intervals of dinner by the higher classes in Persia.\n\n[FN#451] Metaphor from loading camels and mules. To \"eat\" a piece is to take it.\n\n[FN#452] Arab. \"Bil\u00e1bil\"; a plural of \"Bulbul\" with a double entendre bal\u00e1bil (plur. of ballalah)=heart's troubles, and \"bal\u00e1, bul\"=a calamity, nay, etc.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/5144086", "artist_names": "Grace Petrie", "full_title": "Aeroplanes and Stars by\u00a0Grace\u00a0Petrie",

"The Female Quixote  (chap. 1.2.7) LyricsWhich treats of the Olympic Games.\n\nWhile Arabella was ruminating on the unaccountable Behaviour of her new Acquaintance, she received a Letter from her Uncle, informing her (for she had expresly forbid Mr. Glanville to write to her), that his Son and Daughter intended to set out for her Seat in a few Days.\n\nThis News was received with great Satisfaction by Arabella, who hoped to find an agreeable Companion in her Cousin; and was not so insensible of Mr. Glanville's Merit, as not to feel some kind of Pleasure at the Thought of seeing him again.\n\nThis Letter was soon followed, by the Arrival of Mr. Glanville, and his Sister; who, upon the Sight of Arabella, discovered some Appearance of Astonishment and Chagrin; for, notwithstanding all her Brother had told her of her Accomplishments, she could not conceive it possible for a young Lady, bred up in the Country, to be so perfectly elegant and genteel as she found her Cousin.\n\nAs Miss Charlotte had a large Share of Coquetry in her Composition, and was fond of Beauty in none of her own Sex but herself, she was sorry to see Lady Bella possessed of so great a Share; and, being in Hopes her Brother had drawn a flattering Figure of her Cousin, she was extremely disappointed at finding the Original so handsome.\n\nArabella, on the contrary, was highly pleased with Miss Glanville; and, finding her Person very agreeable, did not fail to commend her Beauty: A sort of Complaisance mightily in Use among the Heroines, who knew not what Envy or Emulation meant.\nMiss Glanville received her Praises with great Politeness, but could not find in her Heart to return them: And, as soon as these Compliments were over, Mr. Glanville told Lady Bella, how tedious he had found the short Absence she had forced him to, and how great was his Satisfaction at seeing her again.\n\nI shall not dispute the Truth of your last Assertion, replied Arabella, smiling, since I verily believe, you are mighty well satisfied at present; but I know not how you will make it appear, that an Absence, which you allow to be short, has seemed so tedious to you; for this is a manifest Contradiction: However, pursued she, preventing his Reply, you look so well, and so much at Ease, that I am apt to believe, Absence has agreed very well with you.\n\nAnd yet I assure you, Madam, said Mr. Glanville, interrupting her, that I have suffered more Uneasiness during this Absence, than I fear you will permit me to tell you.\n\nSince, replied Arabella, that Uneasiness has neither made you thinner, nor paler, I don't think you ought to be pitied: For, to say the Truth, in these Sort of Matters, a Person's bare Testimony has but little Weight.\n\nMr. Glanville was going to make her some Answer; when MissGlanville, who, while they had been speaking, was adjusting her Dress at the Glass, came up to them, and made the Conversation more general.\n\nAfter Dinner, they adjourned to the Gardens, where the gay MissGlanville, running eagerly from one Walk to another, gave her Brother as many Opportunities of talking to Lady Bella as he could wish: However, he stood in such Awe of her, and dreaded so much another Banishment, that he did not dare, otherwise than by distant Hints, to mention his Passion; and Arabella, well enough pleased with a Respect that in some measure came up to her Expectation, discovered no Resentment at Insinuations she was at Liberty to dissemble the Knowlege of: And if he could not, by her Behaviour, flatter himself with any great Hopes, yet he found as little Reason, in Arabella's Language, to despair.\n\nMiss Glanville, at the End of a few Weeks, was so tired of the magnificent Solitude she lived in, that she heartily repented her Journey; and insinuated to her Brother, her Inclination to return to Town.\n\nMr. Glanville, knowing his Stay was regulated by his Sister's, intreated her not to expose him to the Mortification of leaving Arabella so soon; and promised her he would contrive some Amusements for her, which should make her relish the Country better than she had yet done.\n\nAccordingly, he proposed to Arabella to go to the Races, which were to be held at \u2014\u2014 a few Miles from the Castle: She would have excused herself, upon account of her Mourning; but Miss Glanville discovered so great an Inclination to be present at this Diversion, that Arabella could no longer refuse to accompany her.\n\nSince, said she to Miss Glanville, you are fond of public Diversions, it happens very luckily, that these Races are to be held at the Time you are here: I never heard of them before, and I presume 'tis a good many Years since they were last celebrated. Pray, Sir, pursued she, turning toGlanville, do not these Races, in some Degree, resemble the OlympicGames? Do the Candidates ride in Chariots?\n\nNo, Madam, replied Glanville; the Jockeys are mounted upon the fleetest Coursers they can procure; and he who first reaches the Goal obtains the Prize.\n\nAnd who is the fair Lady that is to bestow it? resumed Arabella: I dare engage one of her Lovers will enter the Lists; she will, doubtless, be in no less Anxiety than he; and the Shame of being overcome, will hardly affect him with more Concern, than herself; that is, provided he be so happy as to have gained her Affections. I cannot help thinking the fair Elismonda was extremely happy in this Particular: For she had the Satisfaction to see her secret Admirer Victor in all the Exercises at the Olympic Games, and carry away the Prize from many Princes, and Persons of rare Quality, who were Candidates with him; and he had also the Glory to receive three Crowns in one Day, from the Hands of his adored Princess; who, questionless, bestowed them upon him with an infinite deal of Joy.\n\nWhat Sort of Races were those, Madam? said Miss Glanville; whose Reading had been very confined.\nThe Olympic Games, Miss, said Arabella, so called from Olympia, a City near which they were performed, in the Plains of Elis, consisted of Foot and ChariotRaces; Combats with the Cestus; Wrestling, and other Sports. They were instituted in Honour of the Gods and Heroes; and were therefore termed sacred, and were considered as a Part of Religion.\n\nThey were a kind of School, or military Apprenticeship; in which the Courage of the Youth found constant Employment: And the Reason why Victory in those Games was attended with such extraordinary Applause, was, that their Minds might be quickened with great and noble Prospects, when, in this Image of War, they arrived to a Pitch of Glory, approaching, in some respects, to that of the most famous Conquerors. They thought this Sort of Triumph one of the greatest Parts of Happiness of which Human Nature was capable: So that when Diagoras had seen his Sons crowned in the Olympic Games, one of his Friends made him this Compliment, Now, Diagoras, you may die satisfied; since you can't be a God. It would tire you, perhaps, was I to describe all the Exercises performed there: But you may form a general Notion of them, from what you have doubtless read of Justs and Tournaments.\n\nReally, said Miss Glanville, I never read about any such Things.\n\nNo! replied Arabella, surprised: Well, then, I must tell you, that they hold a middle Place, between a Diversion and a Combat; but the OlympicGames were attended with a much greater Pomp and Variety: And not only all Greece, but other neighbouring Nations, were in a manner drained, to furnish out the Appearance.\n\nWell, for my Part, said Miss Glanville, I never before heard of these Sort of Races; those I have been at were quite different. I know the Prizes and Bets are sometimes very considerable.\n\nAnd, doubtless, interrupted Arabella, there are a great many Heroes who signalize themselves at these Races; not for the sake of the Prize, which would be unworthy of great Souls, but to satisfy that burning Desire of Glory, which spurs them on to every Occasion of gaining it.\n\nAs for the Heroes, or Jockeys, said Miss Glanville, call them what you please, I believe they have very little Share, either of the Profit or Glory: For their Masters have the one, and the Horses the other.\n\nTheir Masters! interrupted Arabella: What, I suppose, a great many foreign Princes send their Favourites to Combat, in their Name? I remember to have read, that Alcibiades triumphed three times successively at the Olympic Games, by means of one of his Domestics, who, in his Master's Name, entered the Lists.\n\nMr. Glanville, fearing his Sister would make some absurd Answer, and thereby disoblige his Cousin, took up the Discourse: And, turning it upon the Grecian History, engrossed her Conversation, for two Hours, wholly to himself; while Miss Glanville (to whom all they said was quite unintelligible) diverted herself with humming a Tune, and tinkling her Cousin's Harpsichord; which proved no Interruption to the more rational Entertainment of her Brother and Arabella.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 12, "api_path": "/songs/150926", "artist_names": "George Wallace", "full_title": "\"Segregation Forever\" Speech by\u00a0George\u00a0Wallace", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "id": 150926, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 16, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1622516988, "path": "/George-wallace-segregation-forever-speech-annotated", "pyongs_count": 4, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/George-wallace-segregation-forever-speech-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "song_art_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 2, "hot": false}, "title": "\u201cSegregation Forever\u201d Speech", "title_with_featured": "\"Segregation Forever\" Speech", "updated_by_human_at": 1622516988, "url": "https://genius.com/George-wallace-segregation-forever-speech-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/49861", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "id": 49861, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "George Wallace", "slug": "George-wallace", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/George-wallace"}, "artist": "George Wallace", "lyrics": "\u201cSegregation Forever\u201d Speech LyricsBefore I begin my talk with you, I want to ask you for a few minutes patience while I say something that is on my heart: I want to thank those home folks of my county who first gave an anxious country boy his opportunity to serve in State politics. I shall always owe a lot to those who gave me that first opportunity to serve...\n\nThis is the day of my Inauguration as Governor of the State of Alabama. And on this day I feel a deep obligation to renew my pledges, my covenants with you, the people of this great state.\n\nGeneral Robert E. Lee said that \"duty\" is the sublimest word on the English language and I have come, increasingly, to realize what he meant. I SHALL do my duty to you, God helping...to every man, to every woman...yes, to every child in this state. I shall fulfill my duty toward honesty and economy in our State government so that no man shall have a part of his livelihood cheated and no child shall have a bit of his future stolen away.\n\nI have said to you that I would eliminate the liquor agents in this state and that the money saved would be returned to our citizens...I am happy to report to you that I am now filling orders for several hundred one-way tickets and stamped on them are these words...\"for liquor agents...destination:...out of Alabama.\" I am happy to report to you that the big-wheeling cocktail-party boys have gotten the word that their free whiskey and boat rides are over...that the farmer in the field, the worker in the factory, the businessman in his office, the housewife in her home, have decided that the money can be better spent to help our children's education and our older citizens...and they have put a man in office to see that it is done. It shall be done. Let me say one more time...no more liquor drinking in your governor's mansion.\n\nI shall fulfill my duty in working hard to bring industry into our state, not only by maintaining an honest, sober and free-enterprise climate of government in which industry can have confidence . . but in going out and getting it . . . so that our people can have industrial jobs in Alabama and provide a better life for their children.\n\nI shall not forget my duty to our senior citizens...so that their lives can be lived in dignity and enrichment of the golden years, nor to our sick, both mental and physical...and they will know we have not forsaken them. I want the farmer to feel confident that in this State government he has a partner who will work with him in raising his income and increasing his markets. And I want the laboring man to know he has a friend who is sincerely striving to better his field of endeavor.\nI want to assure every child that this State government is not afraid to invest in their future through education, so that they will not be handicapped on every threshold of their lives.\nToday I have stood, where once Jefferson Davis stood, and took an oath to my people. It is very appropriate then that from this Cradle of the Confederacy, this very Heart of the Great Anglo-Saxon Southland, that today we sound the drum for freedom as have our generations of forebears before us done, time and time again through history. Let us rise to the call of freedomloving blood that is in us and send our answer to the tyranny that clanks its chains upon the South. In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth, I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny...and I say...segregation today...segregation tomorrow...segregation forever.\n\nThe Washington, D.C. school riot report is disgusting and revealing. We will not sacrifice our children to any such type school system--and you can write that down. The federal troops in Mississippi could be better used guarding the safety of the citizens of Washington, D.C., where it is even unsafe to walk or go to a ballgame--and that is the nation's capitol. I was safer in a B-29 bomber over Japan during the war in an air raid, than the people of Washington are walking to the White House neighborhood. A closer example is Atlanta. The city officials fawn for political reasons over school integration and THEN build barricades to stop residential integration--what hypocrisy!\n\nLet us send this message back to Washington by our representatives who are with us today--that from this day we are standing up, and the heel of tyranny does not fit the neck of an upright man . . . that we intend to take the offensive and carry our fight for freedom across the nation, wielding the balance of power we know we possess in the Southland . . . . that WE, not the insipid bloc of voters of some sections...will determine in the next election who shall sit in the White House of these United States...That from this day, from this hour...from this minute...we give the word of a race of honor that we will tolerate their boot in our face no longer...and let those certain judges put that in their opium pipes of power and smoke it for what it is worth.\n\nHear me, Southerners! You sons and daughters who have moved north and west throughout this nation...we call on you from your native soil to join with us in national support and vote...and we know...wherever you are...away from the hearths of the Southland...that you will respond, for though you may live in the fartherest reaches of this vast country...your heart has never left Dixieland.\n\nAnd you native sons and daughters of old New England's rock-ribbed patriotism...and you sturdy natives of the great Mid-West...and you descendants of the far West flaming spirit of pioneer freedom...we invite you to come and be with us...for you are of the Southern spirit...and the Southern philosophy...you are Southerners too and brothers with us in our fight.\n\nWhat I have said about segregation goes double this day...and what I have said to or about some federal judges goes TRIPLE this day.\n\nAlabama has been blessed by God as few states in this Union have been blessed. Our state owns ten percent of all the natural resources of all the states in our country. Our inland waterway system is second to none . . . and has the potential of being the greatest waterway transport system in the entire world. We possess over thirty minerals in usable quantities and our soil is rich and varied, suited to a wide variety of plants. Our native pine and forestry system produces timber faster than we can cut it and yet we have only pricked the surface of the great lumber and pulp potential.\n\nWith ample rainfall and rich grasslands our live stock industry is in the infancy of a giant future that can make us a center of the big and growing meat packing and prepared foods marketing. We have the favorable climate, streams, woodlands, beaches, and natural beauty to make us a recreational Mecca in the booming tourist and vacation industry. Nestled in the great Tennessee Valley, we possess the Rocket center of the world and the keys to the space frontier.\n\nWhile the trade with a developing Europe built the great port cities of the east coast, our own fast developing port of Mobile faces as a magnetic gateway to the great continent of South America, well over twice as large and hundreds of times richer in resources, even now awakening to the growing probes of enterprising capital with a potential of growth and wealth beyond any present dream for our port development and corresponding results throughout the connecting waterways that thread our state.\n\nAnd while the manufacturing industries of free enterprise have been coming to our state in increasing numbers, attracted by our bountiful natural resources, our growing numbers of skilled workers and our favorable conditions, their present rate of settlement here can be increased from the trickle they now represent to a stream of enterprise and endeavor, capital and expansion that can join us in our work of development and enrichment of the educational futures of our children, the opportunities of our citizens and the fulfillment of our talents as God has given them to us. To realize our ambitions and to bring to fruition our dreams, we as Alabamians must take cognizance of the world about us. We must re-define our heritage, re-school our thoughts in the lessons our forefathers knew so well, first hand, in order to function and to grow and to prosper. We can no longer hide our head in the sand and tell ourselves that the ideology of our free fathers is not being attacked and is not being threatened by another idea...for it is. We are faced with an idea that if a centralized government assume enough authority, enough power over its people, that it can provide a utopian life . . that if given the power to dictate, to forbid, to require, to demand, to distribute, to edict and to judge what is best and enforce that will produce only \"good\"...and it shall be our father...and our God. It is an idea of government that encourages our fears and destroys our faith...for where there is faith, there is no fear, and where there is fear, there is no faith. In encouraging our fears of economic insecurity it demands we place that economic management and control with government; in encouraging our fear of educational development it demands we place that education and the minds of our children under management and control of government, and even in feeding our fears of physical infirmities and declining years, it offers and demands to father us through it all and even into the grave. It is a government that claims to us that it is bountiful as it buys its power from us with the fruits of its rapaciousness of the wealth that free men before it have produced and builds on crumbling credit without responsibilities to the debtors . . . our children. It is an ideology of government erected on the encouragement of fear and fails to recognize the basic law of our fathers that governments do not produce wealth...people produce wealth...free people; and those people become less free...as they learn there is little reward for ambition...that it requires faith to risk...and they have none...as the government must restrict and penalize and tax incentive and endeavor and must increase its expenditures of bounties...then this government must assume more and more police powers and we find we are become government-fearing people...not God-fearing people. We find we have replaced faith with fear...and though we may give lip service to the Almighty...in reality, government has become our god. It is, therefore, a basically ungodly government and its appeal to the psuedo-intellectual and the politician is to change their status from servant of the people to master of the people...to play at being God...without faith in God...and without the wisdom of God. It is a system that is the very opposite of Christ for it feeds and encourages everything degenerate and base in our people as it assumes the responsibilities that we ourselves should assume. Its psuedo-liberal spokesmen and some Harvard advocates have never examined the logic of its substitution of what it calls \"human rights\" for individual rights, for its propaganda play on words has appeal for the unthinking. Its logic is totally material and irresponsible as it runs the full gamut of human desires...including the theory that everyone has voting rights without the spiritual responsibility of preserving freedom. Our founding fathers recognized those rights...but only within the framework of those spiritual responsibilities. But the strong, simple faith and sane reasoning of our founding fathers has long since been forgotten as the so-called \"progressives\" tell us that our Constitution was written for \"horse and buggy\" days...so were the Ten Commandments.\n\nNot so long ago men stood in marvel and awe at the cities, the buildings, the schools, the autobahns that the government of Hitler's Germany had built...just as centuries before they stood in wonder of Rome's building...but it could not stand ...for the system that built it had rotted the souls of the builders...and in turn ...rotted the foundation of what God meant that men should be. Today that same system on an international scale is sweeping the world. It is the \"changing world\" of which we are told...it is called \"new\" and \"liberal\". It is as old as the oldest dictator. It is degenerate and decadent. As the national racism of Hitler's Germany persecuted a national minority to the whim of a national majority . . . so the international racism of the liberals seek to persecute the international white minority to the whim of the international colored majority...so that we are footballed about according to the favor of the Afro-Asian bloc. But the Belgian survivors of the Congo cannot present their case to a war crimes commission...nor the Portuguese of Angola...nor the survivors of Castro...nor the citizens of Oxford, Mississippi.\n\nIt is this theory of international power politic that led a group of men on the Supreme Court for the first time in American history to issue an edict, based not on legal precedent, but upon a volume, the editor of which said our Constitution is outdated and must be changed and the writers of which, some had admittedly belonged to as many as half a hundred communist-front organizations. It is this theory that led this same group of men to briefly bare the ungodly core of that philosophy in forbidding little school children to say a prayer. And we find the evidence of that ungodliness even in the removal of the words \"in God we trust\" from some of our dollars, which was placed there as like evidence by our founding fathers as the faith upon which this system of government was built. It is the spirit of power thirst that caused a President in Washington to take up Caesar's pen and with one stroke of it make a law. A Law which the law making body of Congress refused to pass...a law that tells us that we can or cannot buy or sell our very homes, except by his conditions...and except at HIS descretion. It is the spirit of power thirst that led the same President to launch a full offensive of twenty-five thousand troops against a university...of all places...in his own country...and against his own people, when this nation maintains only six thousand troops in the beleagured city of Berlin. We have witnessed such acts of \"might makes right\" over the world as men yielded to the temptation to play God...but we have never before witnessed it in America. We reject such acts as free men.\nWe do not defy, for there is nothing to defy...since as free men we do not recognize any government right to give freedom...or deny freedom. No government erected by man has that right. As Thomas Jefferson said, \"The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time; no King holds the right of liberty in his hands.\" Nor does any ruler in American government.\n\nWe intend, quite simply, to practice the free heritage as bequeathed to us as sons of free fathers. We intend to re-vitalize the truly new and progressive form of government that is less that two hundred years old...a government first founded in this nation simply and purely on faith...that there is a personal God who rewards good and punishes evil...that hard work will receive its just deserts...that ambition and ingenuity and incentiveness...and profit of such...are admirable traits and goals . . that the individual is encouraged in his spiritual growth and from that growth arrives at a character that enhances his charity toward others and from that character and that charity so is influenced business, and labor and farmer and government. We intend to renew our faith as God-fearing men . . . not government-fearing men nor any other kind of fearing men. We intend to roll up our sleeves and pitch in to develop this full bounty God has given us . . . to live full and useful lives and in absolute freedom from all fear. Then can we enjoy the full richness of the Great American Dream.\n\nWe have placed this sign, \"In God We Trust,\" upon our State Capitol on this Inauguration Day as physical evidence of determination to renew the faith of our fathers and to practice the free heritage they bequeathed to us. We do this with the clear and solemn knowledge that such physical evidence is evidently a direct violation of the logic of that Supreme Court in Washington D.C., and if they or their spokesmen in this state wish to term this defiance...I say...then let them make the most of it.\n\nThis nation was never meant to be a unit of one...but a united of the many...that is the exact reason our freedom loving forefathers established the states, so as to divide the rights and powers among the states, insuring that no central power could gain master government control.\n\nIn united effort we were meant to live under this government...whether Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Church of Christ, or whatever one's denomination or religious belief...each respecting the others right to a separate denomination...each, by working to develop his own, enriching the total of all our lives through united effort. And so it was meant in our political lives...whether Republican, Democrat, Prohibition, or whatever political party . . . each striving from his separate political station . . . respecting the rights of others to be separate and work from within their political framework...and each separate political station making its contribution to our lives...\n\nAnd so it was meant in our racial lives...each race, within its own framework has the freedom to teach...to instruct...to develop...to ask for and receive deserved help from others of separate racial stations. This is the great freedom of our American founding fathers...but if we amalgamate into the one unit as advocated by the communist philosophers...then the enrichment of our lives...the freedom for our development...is gone forever. We become, therefore, a mongrel unit of one under a single all powerful government...and we stand for everything...and for nothing.\n\nThe true brotherhood of America, of respecting the separateness of others . . and uniting in effort...has been so twisted and distorted from its original concept that there is a small wonder that communism is winning the world. We invite the negro citizens of Alabama to work with us from his separate racial station...as we will work with him...to develop, to grow in individual freedom and enrichment. We want jobs and a good future for BOTH races...the tubercular and the infirm. This is the basic heritage of my religion, if which I make full practice...for we are all the handiwork of God.\n\nBut we warn those, of any group, who would follow the false doctrine of communistic amalgamation that we will not surrender our system of government...our freedom of race and religion...that freedom was won at a hard price and if it requires a hard price to retain it...we are able...and quite willing to pay it.\n\nThe liberals' theory that poverty, discrimination and lack of opportunity is the cause of communism is a false theory...if it were true the South would have been the biggest single communist bloc in the western hemisphere long ago...for after the great War Between the States, our people faced a desolate land of burned universities, destroyed crops and homes, with manpower depleted and crippled, and even the mule, which was required to work the land, was so scarce that whole communities shared one animal to make the spring plowing. There were no government handouts, no Marshall Plan aid, no coddling to make sure that our people would not suffer; instead the South was set upon by the vulturous carpetbagger and federal troops, all loyal Southerners were denied the vote at the point of bayonet, so that the infamous, illegal 14th Amendment might be passed. There was no money, no food and no hope of either. But our grandfathers bent their knee only in church and bowed their head only to God.\n\nNot for a single instant did they ever consider the easy way of federal dictatorship and amalgamation in return for fat bellies. They fought. They dug sweet roots from the ground with their bare hands and boiled them in iron pots...they gathered poke salad from the woods and acorns from the ground. They fought. They followed no false doctrine...they knew what the wanted...and they fought for freedom! They came up from their knees in the greatest disply of sheer nerve, grit and guts that has ever been set down in the pages of written history...and they won! The great writer, Rudyard Kipling wrote of them, that: \"There in the Southland of the United States of America, lives the greatest fighting breed of man...in all the world!\"\n\nAnd that is why today, I stand ashamed of the fat, well-fed whimperers who say that it is inevitable...that our cause is lost. I am ashamed of them...and I am ashamed for them. They do not represent the people of the Southland.\n\nAnd may we take note of one other fact, with all trouble with communists that some sections of this country have...there are not enough native communists in the South to fill up a telephone booth...and THAT is a matter of public FBI record. We remind all within hearing of this Southland that a Southerner, Peyton Randolph, presided over the Continental Congress in our nation's beginning...that a Southerner, Thomas Jefferson, wrote the Declaration of Independence, that a Southerner, George Washington, is the Father of our country...that a Southerner, James Madison, authored our Constitution, that a Southerner, George Mason, authored the Bill of Rights and it was a Southerner who said, \"Give me liberty...or give me death,\" Patrick Henry.\n\nSoutherners played a most magnificent part in erecting this great divinely inspired system of freedom...and as God is our witnesses, Southerners will save it.\nLet us, as Alabamians, grasp the hand of destiny and walk out of the shadow of fear...and fill our divine destination. Let us not simply defend . . but let us assume the leadership of the fight and carry our leadership across this nation. God has placed us here in this crisis...let is not fail in this...our most historical moment.\n\nYou are here today, present in this audience, and to you over this great state, wherever you are in sound of my voice, I want to humbly and with all sincerity, thank you for your faith in me.\n\nI promise you that I will try to make you a good governor. I promise you that, as God gives me the wisdom and the strength, I will be sincere with you. I will be honest with you.\n\nI will apply the old sound rule of our fathers, that anything worthy of our defense is worthy of one hundred percent of our defense. I have been taught that freedom meant freedom from any threat or fear of government. I was born in that freedom, I was raised in that freedom...I intend to live in that freedom...and God willing, when I die, I shall leave that freedom to my children...as my father left it to me.\n\nMy pledge to you...to \"Stand up for Alabama,\" is a stronger pledge today than it was the first day I made that pledge. I shall \"Stand up for Alabama,\" as Governor of our State...you stand with me...and we, together, can give courageous leadership to millions of people throughout this nation who look to the South for their hope in this fight to win and preserve our freedoms and liberties.\n\nSo help me God.\n\nAnd my prayer is that the Father who reigns above us will bless all the people of this great sovereign State and nation, both white and black.\n\nI thank you.4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/4459183", "artist_names": "Eddie Floyd", "full_title": "Don't Rock The

at a distance, from a twenty-mile radius, as we used to see it from the railway when we arrived there every year in Holy Week, was no more than a church epitomising the town, representing it, speaking of it and for it to the horizon, and as one drew near, gathering close about its long, dark cloak, sheltering from the wind, on the open plain, as a shepherd gathers his sheep, the woolly grey backs of its flocking houses, which a fragment of its mediaeval ramparts enclosed, here and there, in an outline as scrupulously circular as that of a little town in a primitive painting. To live in, Combray was a trifle depressing, like its streets, whose houses, built of the blackened stone of the country, fronted with outside steps, capped with gables which projected long shadows downwards, were so dark that one had, as soon as the sun began to go down, to draw back the curtains in the sitting-room windows; streets with the solemn names of Saints, not a few of whom figured in the history of the early lords of Combray, such as the Rue Saint-Hilaire, the Rue Saint-Jacques, in which my aunt's house stood, the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde, which ran past her railings, and the Rue du Saint-Esprit, on to which the little garden gate opened; and these Combray streets exist in so remote a quarter of my memory, painted in colours so different from those in which the world is decked for me to-day, that in fact one and all of them, and the church which towered above them in the Square, seem to me now more unsubstantial than the projections of my magic-lantern; while at times I feel that to be able to cross the Rue Saint-Hilaire again, to engage a room in the Rue de l'Oiseau, in the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesch\u00e9, from whose windows in the pavement used to rise a smell of cooking which rises still in my mind, now and then, in the same warm gusts of comfort, would be to secure a contact with the unseen world more marvellously supernatural than it would be to make Golo's acquaintance and to chat with Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandfather's cousin\u2014by courtesy my great-aunt\u2014with whom we used to stay, was the mother of that aunt L\u00e9onie who, since her husband's (my uncle Octave's) death, had gradually declined to leave, first Combray, then her house in Combray, then her bedroom, and finally her bed; and who now never 'came down,' but lay perpetually in an indefinite condition of grief, physical exhaustion, illness, obsessions, and religious observances. Her own room looked out over the Rue Saint-Jacques, which ran a long way further to end in the Grand-Pr\u00e9 (as distinct from the Petit-Pr\u00e9, a green space in the centre of the town where three streets met) and which, monotonous and grey, with the three high steps of stone before almost every one of its doors, seemed like a deep furrow cut by some sculptor of gothic images in the very block of stone out of which he had fashioned a Calvary or a Crib. My aunt's life was now practically confined to two adjoining rooms, in one of which she would rest in the afternoon while they, aired the other. They were rooms of that country order which (just as in certain climes whole tracts of air or ocean are illuminated or scented by myriads of protozoa which we cannot see) fascinate our sense of smell with the countless odours springing from their own special virtues, wisdom, habits, a whole secret system of life, invisible, superabundant and profoundly moral, which their atmosphere holds in solution; smells natural enough indeed, and coloured by circumstances as are those of the neighbouring countryside, but already humanised, domesticated, confined, an exquisite, skilful, limpid jelly, blending all the fruits of the season which have left the orchard for the store-room, smells changing with the year, but plenishing, domestic smells, which compensate for the sharpness of hoar frost with the sweet savour of warm bread, smells lazy and punctual as a village clock, roving smells, pious smells; rejoicing in a peace which brings only an increase of anxiety, and in a prosiness which serves as a deep source of poetry to the stranger who passes through their midst without having lived amongst them. The air of those rooms was saturated with the fine bouquet of a silence so nourishing, so succulent that I could not enter them without a sort of greedy enjoyment, particularly on those first mornings, chilly still, of the Easter holidays, when I could taste it more fully, because I had just arrived then at Combray: before I went in to wish my aunt good day I would be kept waiting a little time in the outer room, where the sun, a wintry sun still, had crept in to warm itself before the fire, lighted already between its two brick sides and plastering all the room and everything in it with a smell of soot, making the room like one of those great open hearths which one finds in the country, or one of the canopied mantelpieces in old castles under which one sits hoping that in the world outside it is raining or snowing, hoping almost for a catastrophic deluge to add the romance of shelter and security to the comfort of a snug retreat; I would turn to and fro between the prayer-desk and the stamped velvet armchairs, each one always draped in its crocheted antimacassar, while the fire, baking like a pie the appetising smells with which the air of the room, was thickly clotted, which the dewy and sunny freshness of the morning had already 'raised' and started to 'set,' puffed them and glazed them and fluted them and swelled them into an invisible though not impalpable country cake, an immense puff-pastry, in which, barely waiting to savour the crustier, more delicate, more respectable, but also drier smells of the cupboard, the chest-of-drawers, and the patterned wall-paper I always returned with an unconfessed gluttony to bury myself in the nondescript, resinous, dull, indigestible, and fruity smell of the flowered quilt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the next room I could hear my aunt talking quietly to herself. She never spoke save in low tones, because she believed that there was something broken in her head and floating loose there, which she might displace by talking too loud; but she never remained for long, even when alone, without saying something, because she believed that it was good for her throat, and that by keeping the blood there in circulation it would make less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she was liable; besides, in the life of complete inertia which she led she attached to the least of her sensations an extraordinary importance, endowed them with a Protean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to keep them secret, and, failing a confidant to whom she might communicate them, she used to promulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue which was her sole form of activity. Unfortunately, having formed the habit of thinking aloud, she did not always take care to see that there was no one in the adjoining room, and I would often hear her saying to herself: \"I must not forget that I never slept a wink\"\u2014for \"never sleeping a wink\" was her great claim to distinction, and one admitted and respected in our household vocabulary; in the morning Fran\u00e7oise would not 'call' her, but would simply 'come to' her; during the day, when my aunt wished to take a nap, we used to say just that she wished to 'be quiet' or to 'rest'; and when in conversation she so far forgot herself as to say \"what made me wake up,\" or \"I dreamed that,\" she would flush and at once correct herself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After waiting a minute, I would go in and kiss her; Fran\u00e7oise would be making her tea; or, if my aunt were feeling 'upset,' she would ask instead for her 'tisane,' and it would be my duty to shake out of the chemist's little package on to a plate the amount of lime-blossom required for infusion in boiling water. The drying of the stems had twisted them into a fantastic trellis, in whose intervals the pale flowers opened, as though a painter had arranged them there, grouping them in the most decorative poses. The leaves, which had lost or altered their own appearance, assumed those instead of the most incongruous things imaginable, as though the transparent wings of flies or the blank sides of labels or the petals of roses had been collected and pounded, or interwoven as birds weave the material for their nests. A thousand trifling little details\u2014the charming prodigality of the chemist\u2014details which would have been eliminated from an artificial preparation, gave me, like a book in which one is astonished to read the name of a person whom one knows, the pleasure of finding that these were indeed real lime-blossoms, like those I had seen, when coming from the train, in the Avenue de la Gare, altered, but only because they were not imitations but the very same blossoms, which had grown old. And as each new character is merely a metamorphosis from something older, in these little grey balls I recognised green buds plucked before their time; but beyond all else the rosy, moony, tender glow which lit up the blossoms among the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden roses\u2014marking, as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place of a vanished fresco, the difference between those parts of the tree which had and those which had not been 'in bloom'\u2014shewed me that these were petals which, before their flowering-time, the chemist's package had embalmed on warm evenings of spring. That rosy candlelight was still their colour, but half-extinguished and deadened in the diminished life which was now theirs, and which may be called the twilight of a flower. Presently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion, in which she would relish the savour of dead or faded blossom, a little madeleine, of which she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At one side of her bed stood a big yellow chest-of-drawers of lemon-wood, and a table which served at once as pharmacy and as high altar, on which, beneath a statue of Our Lady and a bottle of Vichy-C\u00e9lestins, might be found her service-books and her medical prescriptions, everything that she needed for the performance, in bed, of her duties to soul and body, to keep the proper times for pepsin and for vespers. On the other side her bed was bounded by the window: she had the street beneath her eyes, and would read in it from morning to night to divert the tedium of her life, like a Persian prince, the daily but immemorial chronicles of Combray, which she would discuss in detail afterwards with Fran\u00e7oise.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would not have been five minutes with my aunt before she would send me away in case I made her tired. She would hold out for me to kiss her sad brow, pale and lifeless, on which at this early hour she would not yet have arranged the false hair and through which the bones shone like the points of a crown of thorns\u2014or the beads of a rosary, and she would say to me: \"Now, my poor child, you must go away; go and get ready for mass; and if you see Fran\u00e7oise downstairs, tell her not to stay too long amusing herself with you; she must come up soon to see if I want anything.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise, who had been for many years in my aunt's service and did not at that time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to ours, was a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we spent in her house. There had been in my infancy, before we first went to Combray, and when my aunt L\u00e9onie used still to spend the winter in Paris with her mother, a time when I knew Fran\u00e7oise so little that on New Year's Day, before going into my great-aunt's house, my mother put a five-franc piece in my hand and said: \"Now, be careful. Don't make any mistake. Wait until you hear me say 'Good morning, Fran\u00e7oise,' and I touch your arm before you give it to her.\" No sooner had we arrived in my aunt's dark hall than we saw in the gloom, beneath the frills of a snowy cap as stiff and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the concentric waves of a smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Fran\u00e7oise, motionless and erect, framed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in its niche. When we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we could discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity, blended with a tender respect for the 'upper classes' which raised to the most honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward. Mamma pinched my arm sharply and said in a loud voice: \"Good morning, Fran\u00e7oise.\" At this signal my fingers parted and I let fall the coin, which found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand. But since we had begun to go to Combray there was no one I knew better than Fran\u00e7oise. We were her favourites, and in the first years at least, while she shewed the same consideration for us as for my aunt, she enjoyed us with a keener relish, because we had, in addition to our dignity as part of 'the family' (for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites the members of a family as much respect as any Greek tragedian), the fresh charm of not being her customary employers. And so with what joy would she welcome us, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so bad for us, on the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was often an icy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her nephews, and if her grandson was good-looking, and what they were going to make of him, and whether he took after his granny.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Later, when no one else was in the room, Mamma, who knew that Fran\u00e7oise was still mourning for her parents, who had been dead for years, would speak of them kindly, asking her endless little questions about them and their lives.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had guessed that Fran\u00e7oise was not over-fond of her son-in-law, and that he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter, as the two could not talk so freely when he was there. And so one day, when Fran\u00e7oise was going to their house, some miles from Combray, Mamma said to her, with a smile: \"Tell me, Fran\u00e7oise, if Julien has had to go away, and you have Marguerite to yourself all day, you will be very sorry, but will make the best of it, won't you?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Fran\u00e7oise answered, laughing: \"Madame knows everything; Madame is worse than the X-rays\" (she pronounced 'x' with an affectation of difficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her, an unlettered woman's, daring to employ a scientific term) \"they brought here for Mme. Octave, which see what is in your heart\"\u2014and she went off, disturbed that anyone should be caring about her, perhaps anxious that we should not see her in tears: Mamma was the first person who had given her the pleasure of feeling that her peasant existence, with its simple joys and sorrows, might offer some interest, might be a source of grief or pleasure to some one other than herself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My aunt resigned herself to doing without Fran\u00e7oise to some extent during our visits, knowing how much my mother appreciated the services of so active and intelligent a maid, one who looked as smart at five o'clock in the morning in her kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills seemed to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for churchgoing; who did everything in the right way, who toiled like a horse, whether she was well or ill, but without noise, without the appearance of doing anything; the only one of my aunt's maids who when Mamma asked for hot water or black coffee would bring them actually boiling; she was one of those servants who in a household seem least satisfactory, at first, to a stranger, doubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him and shew him no special attention, knowing very well that they have no real need of him, that he will cease to be invited to the house sooner than they will be dismissed from it; who, on the other hand, cling with most fidelity to those masters and mistresses who have tested and proved their real capacity, and do not look for that superficial responsiveness, that slavish affability, which may impress a stranger favourably, but often conceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can produce the least trace of individuality.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Fran\u00e7oise, having seen that my parents had everything they required, first went upstairs again to give my aunt her pepsin and to find out from her what she would take for luncheon, very few mornings pased but she was called upon to give an opinion, or to furnish an explanation, in regard to some important event.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just fancy, Fran\u00e7oise, Mme. Goupil went by more than a quarter of an hour late to fetch her sister: if she loses any more time on the way I should not be at all surprised if she got in after the Elevation.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, there'd be nothing wonderful in that,\" would be the answer. Or:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fran\u00e7oise, if you had come in five minutes ago, you would have seen Mme. Imbert go past with some asparagus twice the size of what mother Callot has: do try to find out from her cook where she got them. You know you've been putting asparagus in all your sauces this spring; you might be able to get some like these for our visitors.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I shouldn't be surprised if they came from the Cur\u00e9's,\" Fran\u00e7oise would say, and:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm sure you wouldn't, my poor Fran\u00e7oise,\" my aunt would reply, raising her shoulders. \"From the Cur\u00e9's, indeed! You know quite well that he can never grow anything but wretched little twigs of asparagus, not asparagus at all. I tell you these ones were as thick as my arm. Not your arm, of course, but my-poor arm, which has grown so much thinner again this year.\" Or:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fran\u00e7oise, didn't you hear that bell just now! It split my head.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, Mme. Octave.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, poor girl, your skull must be very thick; you may thank God for that. It was Maguelone come to fetch Dr. Piperaud. He came out with her at once and they went off along the Rue de l'Oiseau. There must be some child ill.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh dear, dear; the poor little creature!\" would come with a sigh from Fran\u00e7oise, who could not hear of any calamity befalling a person unknown to her, even in some distant part of the world, without beginning to lament. Or:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fran\u00e7oise, for whom did they toll the passing-bell just now? Oh dear, of course, it would be for Mme. Rousseau. And to think that I had forgotten that she passed away the other night. Indeed, it is time the Lord called me home too; I don't know what has become of my head since I lost my poor Octave. But I am wasting your time, my good girl.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Indeed no, Mme. Octave, my time is not so precious; whoever made our time didn't sell it to us. I am just going to see that my fire hasn't gone out.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this way Fran\u00e7oise and my aunt made a critical valuation between them, in the course of these morning sessions, of the earliest happenings of the day. But sometimes these happenings assumed so mysterious or so alarming an air that my aunt felt she could not wait until it was time for Fran\u00e7oise to come upstairs, and then a formidable and quadruple peal would resound through the house.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, Mme. Octave, it is not time for your pepsin,\" Fran\u00e7oise would begin. \"Are you feeling faint?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, thank you, Fran\u00e7oise,\" my aunt would reply, \"that is to say, yes; for you know well that there is very seldom a time when I don't feel faint; one day I shall pass away like Mme. Rousseau, before I know where I am; but that is not why I rang. Would you believe that I have just seen, as plainly as I see you, Mme. Goupil with a little girl I didn't know at all. Run and get a pennyworth of salt from Camus. It's not often that Th\u00e9odore can't tell you who a person is.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But that must be M. Pupin's daughter,\" Fran\u00e7oise would say, preferring to stick to an immediate explanation, since she had been perhaps twice already into Camus's shop that morning.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"M. Pupin's daughter! Oh, that's a likely story, my poor Fran\u00e7oise. Do you think I should not have recognised M. Pupin's daughter!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I don't mean the big one, Mme. Octave; I mean the little girl, he one who goes to school at Jouy. I seem to have seen her once already his morning.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, if that's what it is!\" my aunt would say, \"she must have come over for the holidays. Yes, that is it. No need to ask, she will have come over for the holidays. But then we shall soon see Mme. Sazerat come along and ring her sister's door-bell, for her luncheon. That will be it! I saw the boy from Galopin's go by with a tart. You will see that the tart was for Mme. Goupil.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Once Mme. Goupil has anyone in the house, Mme. Octave, you won't be long in seeing all her folk going in to their luncheon there, for it's not so early as it was,\" would be the answer, for Fran\u00e7oise, who was anxious to retire downstairs to look after our own meal, was not sorry to leave my aunt with the prospect of such a distraction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh! not before midday!\" my aunt would reply in a tone of resignation, darting an uneasy glance at the clock, but stealthily, so as not to let it be seen that she, who had renounced all earthly joys, yet found a keen satisfaction in learning that Mme. Goupil was expecting company to luncheon, though, alas, she must wait a little more than an hour still before enjoying the spectacle. \"And it will come in the middle of my luncheon!\" she would murmur to herself. Her luncheon was such a distraction in itself that she did not like any other to come at the same time. \"At least, you will not forget to give me my creamed eggs on one of the flat plates?\" These were the only plates which had pictures on them and my aunt used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the description on whichever might have been sent up to her. She would put on her spectacles and spell out: \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,\" \"Aladdin, or the Wonderful Lamp,\" and smile, and say \"Very good indeed.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I may as well go across to Camus...\" Fran\u00e7oise would hazard, seeing that my aunt had no longer any intention of sending her there.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, no; it's not worth while now; it's certain to be the Pupin girl. My poor Fran\u00e7oise, I am sorry to have made you come upstairs for nothing.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But it was not for nothing, as my aunt well knew, that she had rung for Fran\u00e7oise, since at Combray a person whom one 'didn't know at all' was as incredible a being as any mythological deity, and it was apt to be forgotten that after each occasion on which there had appeared in the Rue du Saint-Esprit or in the Square one of these bewildering phenomena, careful and exhaustive researches had invariably reduced the fabulous monster to the proportions of a person whom one 'did know,' either personally or in the abstract, in his or her civil status as being more or less closely related to some family in Combray. It would turn out to be Mme. Sauton's son discharged from the army, or the Abb\u00e9 Perdreau's niece come home from her convent, or the Cur\u00e9's brother, a tax-collector at Ch\u00e2teaudun, who had just retired on a pension or had come over to Combray for the holidays. On first noticing them you have been impressed by the thought that there might be in Combray people whom you 'didn't know at all,' simply because, you had failed to recognise or identify them at once. And yet long beforehand Mme. Sauton and the Cur\u00e9 had given warning that they expected their 'strangers.' In the evening, when I came in and went upstairs to tell my aunt the incidents of our walk, if I was rash enough to say to her that we had passed, near the Pont-Vieux, a man whom my grandfather didn't know:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A man grandfather didn't know at all!\" she would exclaim. \"That's a likely story.\" None the less, she would be a little disturbed by the news, she would wish to have the details correctly, and so my grandfather would be summoned. \"Who can it have been that you passed near the Pont-Vieux, uncle? A man you didn't know at all?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, of course I did,\" my grandfather would answer; \"it was Prosper, Mme. Bouilleboeuf's gardener's brother.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, well!\" my aunt would say, calm again but slightly flushed still; \"and the boy told me that you had passed a man you didn't know at all!\" After which I would be warned to be more careful of what I said, and not to upset my aunt so by thoughtless remarks. Everyone was so well known in Combray, animals as well as people, that if my aunt had happened to see a dog go by which she 'didn't know at all' she would think about it incessantly, devoting to the solution of the incomprehensible problem all her inductive talent and her leisure hours.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That will be Mme. Sazerat's dog,\" Fran\u00e7oise would suggest, without any real conviction, but in the hope of peace, and so that my aunt should not 'split her head.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As if I didn't know Mme. Sazerat's dog!\"\u2014for my aunt's critical mind would not so easily admit any fresh fact.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, but that will be the new dog M. Galopin has brought her from Lisieux.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, if that's what it is!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It seems, it's a most engaging animal,\" Fran\u00e7oise would go on, having got the story from Th\u00e9odore, \"as clever as a Christian, always in a good temper, always friendly, always everything that's nice. It's not often you see an animal so well-behaved at that age. Mme. Octave, it's high time I left you; I can't afford to stay here amusing myself; look, it's nearly ten o'clock and my fire not lighted yet, and I've still to dress the asparagus.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What, Fran\u00e7oise, more asparagus! It's a regular disease of asparagus you have got this year: you will make our Parisians sick of it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, no, Madame Octave, they like it well enough. They'll be coming back from church soon as hungry as hunters, and they won't eat it out of the back of their spoons, you'll see.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Church! why, they must be there now; you'd better not lose any time. Go and look after your luncheon.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While my aunt gossiped on in this way with Fran\u00e7oise I would have accompanied my parents to mass. How I loved it: how clearly I can see it still, our church at Combray! The old porch by which we went in, black, and full of holes as a cullender, was worn out of shape and deeply furrowed at the sides (as also was the holy water stoup to which it led us) just as if the gentle grazing touch of the cloaks of peasant-women going into the church, and of their fingers dipping into the water, had managed by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force, to impress itself on the stone, to carve ruts in it like those made by cart-wheels upon stone gate-posts against which they are driven every day. Its memorial stones, beneath which the noble dust of the Abbots of Combray, who were buried there, furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual pavement, were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter, for time had softened and sweetened them, and had made them melt like honey and flow beyond their proper margins, either surging out in a milky, frothing wave, washing from its place a florid gothic capital, drowning the white violets of the marble floor; or else reabsorbed into their limits, contracting still further a crabbed Latin inscription, bringing a fresh touch of fantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed characters, closing together two letters of some word of which the rest were disproportionately scattered. Its windows were never so brilliant as on days when the sun scarcely shone, so that if it was dull outside you might be certain of fine weather in church. One of them was filled from top to bottom by a solitary figure, like the king on a playing-card, who lived up there beneath his canopy of stone, between earth and heaven; and in the blue light of its slanting shadow, on weekdays sometimes, at noon, when there was no service (at one of those rare moments when the airy, empty church, more human somehow and more luxurious with the sun shewing off all its rich furnishings, seemed to have almost a habitable air, like the hall\u2014all sculptured stone and painted glass\u2014of some mediaeval mansion), you might see Mme. Sazerat kneel for an instant, laying down on the chair beside her own a neatly corded parcel of little cakes which she had just bought at the baker's and was taking home for her luncheon. In another, a mountain of rosy snow, at whose foot a battle was being fought, seemed to have frozen the window also, which it swelled and distorted with its cloudy sleet, like a pane to which snowflakes have drifted and clung, but flakes illumined by a sunrise\u2014the same, doubtless, which purpled the reredos of the altar with tints so fresh that they seemed rather to be thrown on it for a moment by a light shining from outside and shortly to be extinguished than painted and permanently fastened on the stone. And all of them were so old that you could see, here and there, their silvery antiquity sparkling with the dust of centuries and shewing in its threadbare brilliance the very cords of their lovely tapestry of glass. There was one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred little rectangular windows, of blue principally, like a great game of patience of the kind planned to beguile King Charles VI; but, either because a ray of sunlight had gleamed through it or because my own shifting vision had drawn across the window, whose colours died away and were rekindled by turns, a rare and transient fire\u2014the next instant it had taken on all the iridescence of a peacock's tail, then shook and wavered in a flaming and fantastic shower, distilled and dropping from the groin of the dark and rocky vault down the moist walls, as though it were along the bed of some rainbow grotto of sinuous stalactites that I was following my parents, who marched before me, their prayer-books clasped in their hands; a moment later the little lozenge windows had put on the deep transparence, the unbreakable hardness of sapphires clustered on some enormous breastplate; but beyond which could be distinguished, dearer than all such treasures, a fleeting smile from the sun, which could be seen and felt as well here, in the blue and gentle flood in which it washed the masonry, as on the pavement of the Square or the straw of the market-place; and even on our first Sundays, when we came down before Easter, it would console me for the blackness and bareness of the earth outside by making burst into blossom, as in some springtime in old history among the heirs of Saint Louis, this dazzling and gilded carpet of forget-me-nots in glass.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two tapestries of high warp represented the coronation of Esther (in which tradition would have it that the weaver had given to Ahasuerus the features of one of the kings of France and to Esther those of a lady of Guermantes whose lover he had been); their colours had melted into one another, so as to add expression, relief, light to the pictures. A touch of red over the lips of Esther had strayed beyond their outline; the yellow on her dress was spread with such unctuous plumpness as to have acquired a kind of solidity, and stood boldly out from the receding atmosphere; while the green of the trees, which was still bright in Silk and wool among the lower parts of the panel, but had quite 'gone' at the top, separated in a paler scheme, above the dark trunks, the yellowing upper branches, tanned and half-obliterated by the sharp though sidelong rays of an invisible sun. All these things and, still more than these, the treasures which had come to the church from personages who to me were almost legendary figures (such as the golden cross wrought, it was said, by Saint Eloi and presented by Dagobert, and the tomb of the sons of Louis the Germanic in porphyry and enamelled copper), because of which I used to go forward into the church when we were making our way to our chairs as into a fairy-haunted valley, where the rustic sees with amazement on a rock, a tree, a marsh, the tangible proofs of the little people's supernatural passage\u2014all these things made of the church for me something entirely different from the rest of the town; a building which occupied, so to speak, four dimensions of space\u2014the name of the fourth being Time\u2014which had sailed the centuries with that old nave, where bay after bay, chapel after chapel, seemed to stretch across and hold down and conquer not merely a few yards of soil, but each successive epoch from which the whole building had emerged triumphant, hiding the rugged barbarities of the eleventh century in the thickness of its walls, through which nothing could be seen of the heavy arches, long stopped and blinded with coarse blocks of ashlar, except where, near the porch, a deep groove was furrowed into one wall by the tower-stair; and even there the barbarity was veiled by the graceful gothic arcade which pressed coquettishly upon it, like a row of grown-up sisters who, to hide him from the eyes of strangers, arrange themselves smilingly in front of a countrified, unmannerly and ill-dressed younger brother; rearing into the sky above the Square a tower which had looked down upon Saint Louis, and seemed to behold him still; and thrusting down with its crypt into the blackness of a Merovingian night, through which, guiding us with groping finger-tips beneath the shadowy vault, ribbed strongly as an immense bat's wing of stone, Th\u00e9odore or his sister would light up for us with a candle the tomb of Sigebert's little daughter, in which a deep hole, like the bed of a fossil, had been bored, or so it was said, \"by a crystal lamp which, on the night when the Frankish princess was murdered, had left, of its own accord, the golden chains by which it was suspended where the apse is to-day and with neither the crystal broken nor the light extinguished had buried itself in the stone, through which it had gently forced its way.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then the apse of Combray: what am I to say of that? It was so coarse, so devoid of artistic beauty, even of the religious spirit. From outside, since the street crossing which it commanded was on a lower level, its great wall was thrust upwards from a basement of unfaced ashlar, jagged with flints, in all of which there was nothing particularly ecclesiastical; the windows seemed to have been pierced at an abnormal height, and its whole appearance was that of a prison wall rather than of a church. And certainly in later years, were I to recall all the glorious apses that I had seen, it would never enter my mind to compare with any one of them the apse of Combray. Only, one day, turning out of a little street in some country town, I came upon three alley-ways that converged, and facing them an old wall, rubbed, worn, crumbling, and unusually high; with windows pierced in it far overhead and the same asymmetrical appearance as the apse of Combray. And at that moment I did not say to myself, as at Chartres I might have done or at Rheims, with what strength the religious feeling had been expressed in its construction, but instinctively I exclaimed \"The Church!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The church! A dear, familiar friend; close pressed in the Rue Saint-Hilaire, upon which its north door opened, by its two neighbours, Mme. Loiseau's house and the pharmacy of M. Rapin, against which its walls rested without interspace; a simple citizen of Combray, who might have had her number in the street had the streets of Combray borne numbers, and at whose door one felt that the postman ought to stop on his morning rounds, before going into Mme. Loiseau's and after leaving M. Rapin's, there existed, for all that, between the church and everything in Combray that was not the church a clear line of demarcation which I have never succeeded in eliminating from my mind. In vain might Mme. Loiseau deck her window-sills with fuchsias, which developed the bad habit of letting their branches trail at all times and in all directions, head downwards, and whose flowers had no more important business, when they were big enough to taste the joys of life, than to go and cool their purple, congested cheeks against the dark front of the church; to me such conduct sanctified the fuchsias not at all; between the flowers and the blackened stones towards which they leaned, if my eyes could discern no interval, my mind preserved the impression of an abyss.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From a long way off one could distinguish and identify the steeple of Saint-Hilaire inscribing its unforgettable form upon a horizon beneath which Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which brought us down from Paris at Easter-time my father caught sight of it, as it slipped into every fold of the sky in turn, its little iron cock veering continually in all directions, he would say: \"Come, get your wraps together, we are there.\" And on one of the longest walks we ever took from Combray there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly on to an immense plain, closed at the horizon by strips of forest over which rose and stood alone the fine point of Saint-Hilaire's steeple, but so sharpened and so pink that it seemed to be no more than sketched on the sky by the finger-nail of a painter anxious to give to such a landscape, to so pure a piece of 'nature,' this little sign of art, this single indication of human existence. As one drew near it and could make out the remains of the square tower, half in ruins, which still stood by its side, though without rivalling it in height, one was struck, first of all, by the tone, reddish and sombre, of its stones; and on a misty morning in autumn one would have called it, to see it rising above the violet thunder-cloud of the vineyards, a ruin of purple, almost the colour of the wild vine.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often in the Square, as we came home, my grandmother would make me stop to look up at it. From the tower windows, placed two and two, one pair above another, with that right and original proportion in their spacing to which not only human faces owe their beauty and dignity, it released, it let fall at regular intervals flights of jackdaws which for a little while would wheel and caw, as though the ancient stones which allowed them to sport thus and never seemed to see them, becoming of a sudden uninhabitable and discharging some infinitely disturbing element, had struck them and driven them forth. Then after patterning everywhere the violet velvet of the evening air, abruptly soothed, they would return and be absorbed in the tower, deadly no longer but benignant, some perching here and there (not seeming to move, but snapping, perhaps, and swallowing some passing insect) on the points of turrets, as a seagull perches, with an angler's immobility, on the crest of a wave. Without quite knowing why, my grandmother found in the steeple of Saint-Hilaire that absence of vulgarity, pretension, and meanness which made her love\u2014and deem rich in beneficent influences\u2014nature itself, when the hand of man had not, as did my great-aunt's gardener, trimmed it, and the works of genius. And certainly every part one saw of the church served to distinguish the whole from any other building by a kind of general feeling which pervaded it, but it was in the steeple that the church seemed to display a consciousness of itself, to affirm its individual and responsible existence. It was the steeple which spoke for the church. I think, too, that in a confused way my grandmother found in the steeple of Combray what she prized above anything else in the world, namely, a natural air and an air of distinction. Ignorant of architecture, she would say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My dears, laugh at me if you like; it is not conventionally beautiful, but there is something in its quaint old face which pleases me. If it could play the piano, I am sure it would really play.\" And when she gazed on it, when her eyes followed the gentle tension, the fervent inclination of its stony slopes which drew together as they rose, like hands joined in prayer, she would absorb herself so utterly in the outpouring of the spire that her gaze seemed to leap upwards with it; her lips at the same time curving in a friendly smile for the worn old stones of which the setting sun now illumined no more than the topmost pinnacles, which, at the point where they entered that zone of sunlight and were softened and sweetened by it, seemed to have mounted suddenly far higher, to have become truly remote, like a song whose singer breaks into falsetto, an octave above the accompanying air.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which shaped and crowned and consecrated every occupation, every hour of the day, every point of view in the town. From my bedroom window I could discern no more than its base, which had been freshly covered with slates; but when on Sundays I saw these, in the hot light of a summer morning, blaze like a black sun I would say to myself: \"Good heavens! nine o'clock! I must get ready for mass at once if I am to have time to go in and kiss aunt L\u00e9onie first,\" and I would know exactly what was the colour of the sunlight upon the Square, I could feel the heat and dust of the market, the shade behind the blinds of the shop into which Mamma would perhaps go on her way to mass, penetrating its odour of unbleached calico, to purchase a handkerchief or something, of which the draper himself would let her see what he had, bowing from the waist: who, having made everything ready for shutting up, had just gone into the back shop to put on his Sunday coat and to wash his hands, which it was his habit, every few minutes and even on the saddest occasions, to rub one against the other with an air of enterprise, cunning, and success.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And again, after mass, when we looked in to tell Th\u00e9odore to bring a larger loaf than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine weather to come over from Thiberzy for luncheon, we had in front of us the steeple, which, baked and brown itself like a larger loaf still of 'holy bread,' with flakes and sticky drops on it of sunlight, pricked its sharp point into the blue sky. And in the evening, as I came in from my walk and thought of the approaching moment when I must say good night to my mother and see her no more, the steeple was by contrast so kindly, there at the close of day, that I would imagine it as being laid, like a brown velvet cushion, against\u2014as being thrust into the pallid sky which had yielded beneath its pressure, had sunk slightly so as to make room for it, and had correspondingly risen on either side; while the cries of the birds wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence, to elongate its spire still further, and to invest it with some quality beyond the power of words.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even when our errands lay in places behind the church, from which it could not be seen, the view seemed always to have been composed with reference to the steeple, which would stand up, now here, now there, among the houses, and was perhaps even more affecting when it appeared thus without the church. And, indeed, there are many others which look best when seen in this way, and I can call to mind vignettes of housetops with surmounting steeples in quite another category of art than those formed by the dreary streets of Combray. I shall never forget, in a quaint Norman town not far from Balbec, two charming eighteenth-century houses, dear to me and venerable for many reasons, between which, when one looks up at them from a fine garden which descends in terraces to the river, the gothic spire of a church (itself hidden by the houses) soars into the sky with the effect of crowning and completing their fronts, but in a material so different, so precious, so beringed, so rosy, so polished, that it is at once seen to be no more a part of them than would be a part of two pretty pebbles lying side by side, between which it had been washed on the beach, the purple, crinkled spire of some sea-shell spun out into a turret and gay with glossy colour. Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of the town, I know a window from which one can see across a first, a second, and even a third layer of jumbled roofs, street beyond street, a violet bell, sometimes ruddy, sometimes too, in the finest 'prints' which the atmosphere makes of it, of an ashy solution of black; which is, in fact, nothing else than the dome of Saint-Augustin, and which imparts to this view of Paris the character of some of the Piranesi views of Rome. But since into none of these little etchings, whatever the taste my memory may have been able to bring to their execution, was it able to contribute an element I have long lost, the feeling which makes us not merely regard a thing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature without parallel, so none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole section of my inmost life as does the memory of those aspects of the steeple of Combray from the streets behind the church. Whether one saw it at five o'clock when going to call for letters at the post-office, some doors away from one, on the left, raising abruptly with its isolated peak the ridge of housetops; or again, when one had to go in and ask for news of Mme. Sazerat, one's eyes followed the line where it ran low again beyond the farther, descending slope, and one knew that it would be the second turning after the steeple; or yet again, if pressing further afield one went to the station, one saw it obliquely, shewing in profile fresh angles and surfaces, like a solid body surprised at some unknown point in its revolution; or, from the banks of the Vivonne, the apse, drawn muscularly together and heightened in perspective, seemed to spring upwards with the effort which the steeple made to hurl its spire-point into the heart of heaven: it was always to the steeple that one must return, always it which dominated everything else, summing up the houses with an unexpected pinnacle, raised before me like the Finger of God, Whose Body might have been concealed below among the crowd of human bodies without fear of my confounding It, for that reason, with them. And so even to-day in any large provincial town, or in a quarter of Paris which I do not know well, if a passer-by who is 'putting me on the right road' shews me from afar, as a point to aim at, some belfry of a hospital, or a convent steeple lifting the peak of its ecclesiastical cap at the corner of the street which I am to take, my memory need only find in it some dim resemblance to that dear and vanished outline, and the passer-by, should he turn round to make sure that I have not gone astray, would see me, to his astonishment, oblivious of the walk that I had planned to take or the place where I was obliged to call, standing still on the spot, before that steeple, for hours on end, motionless, trying to remember, feeling deep within myself a tract of soil reclaimed from the waters of Lethe slowly drying until the buildings rise on it again; and then no doubt, and then more uneasily than when, just now, I asked him for a direction, I will seek my way again, I will turn a corner... but... the goal is in my heart...\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On our way home from mass we would often meet M. Legrandin, who, detained in Paris by his professional duties as an engineer, could only (except in the regular holiday seasons) visit his home at Combray between Saturday evenings and Monday mornings. He was one of that class of men who, apart from a scientific career in which they may well have proved brilliantly successful, have acquired an entirely different kind of culture, literary or artistic, of which they make no use in the specialised work of their profession, but by which their conversation profits. More 'literary' than many 'men of letters' (we were not aware at this period that M. Legrandin had a distinct reputation as a writer, and so were greatly astonished to find that a well-known composer had set some verses of his to music), endowed with a greater ease in execution than many painters, they imagine that the life they are obliged to lead is not that for which they are really fitted, and they bring to their regular occupations either a fantastic indifference or a sustained and lofty application, scornful, bitter, and conscientious. Tall, with a good figure, a fine, thoughtful face, drooping fair moustaches, a look of disillusionment in his blue eyes, an almost exaggerated refinement of courtesy; a talker such as we had never heard; he was in the sight of my family, who never ceased to quote him as an example, the very pattern of a gentleman, who took life in the noblest and most delicate manner. My grandmother alone found fault with him for speaking a little too well, a little too much like a book, for not using a vocabulary as natural as his loosely knotted Lavalli\u00e8re neckties, his short, straight, almost schoolboyish coat. She was astonished, too, at the furious invective which he was always launching at the aristocracy, at fashionable life, and 'snobbishness'\u2014\"undoubtedly,\" he would say, \"the sin of which Saint Paul is thinking when he speaks of the sin for which there is no forgiveness.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Worldly ambition was a thing which my grandmother was so little capable of feeling, or indeed of understanding, that it seemed to her futile to apply so much heat to its condemnation. Besides, she thought it in not very good taste that M. Legrandin, whose sister was married to a country gentleman of Lower Normandy near Balbec, should deliver himself of such violent attacks upon the nobles, going so far as to blame the Revolution for not having guillotined them all.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well met, my friends!\" he would say as he came towards us. \"You are lucky to spend so much time here; to-morrow I have to go back to Paris, to squeeze back into my niche.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I admit,\" he went on, with his own peculiar smile, gently ironical, disillusioned and vague, \"I have every useless thing in the world in my house there. The only thing wanting is the necessary thing, a great patch of open sky like this. Always try to keep a patch of sky above your life, little boy,\" he added, turning to me. \"You have a soul in you of rare quality, an artist's nature; never let it starve for lack of what it needs.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, on our reaching the house, my aunt would send to ask us whether Mme. Goupil had indeed arrived late for mass, not one of us could inform her. Instead, we increased her anxiety by telling her that there was a painter at work in the church copying the window of Gilbert the Bad. Fran\u00e7oise was at once dispatched to the grocer's, but returned empty-handed owing to the absence of Th\u00e9odore, whose dual profession of choirman, with a part in the maintenance of the fabric, and of grocer's assistant gave him not only relations with all sections of society, but an encyclopaedic knowledge of their affairs.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah!\" my aunt would sigh, \"I wish it were time for Eulalie to come. She is really the only person who will be able to tell me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eulalie was a limping, energetic, deaf spinster who had 'retired' after the death of Mme. de la Bretonnerie, with whom she had been in service from her childhood, and had then taken a room beside the church, from which she would incessantly emerge, either to attend some service, or, when there was no service, to say a prayer by herself or to give Th\u00e9odore a hand; the rest of her time she spent in visiting sick persons like my aunt L\u00e9onie, to whom she would relate everything that had occurred at mass or vespers. She was not above adding occasional pocket-money to the little income which was found for her by the family of her old employers by going from time to time to look after the Cur\u00e9's linen, or that of some other person of note in the clerical world of Combray. Above a mantle of black cloth she wore a little white coif that seemed almost to attach her to some Order, and an infirmity of the skin had stained part of her cheeks and her crooked nose the bright red colour of balsam. Her visits were the one great distraction in the life of my aunt L\u00e9onie, who now saw hardly anyone else, except the reverend Cur\u00e9. My aunt had by degrees erased every other visitor's name from her list, because they all committed the fatal error, in her eyes, of falling into one or other of the two categories of people she most detested. One group, the worse of the two, and the one of which she rid herself first, consisted of those who advised her not to take so much care of herself, and preached (even if only negatively and with no outward signs beyond an occasional disapproving silence or doubting smile) the subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a good red beefsteak would do her more good (her, who had had two dreadful sips of Vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours!) than all her medicine bottles and her bed. The other category was composed of people who appeared to believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought, in fact that she was as seriously ill as she said. And so none of those whom she had allowed upstairs to her room, after considerable hesitation and at Fran\u00e7oise urgent request, and who in the course of their visit had shewn how unworthy they were of the honour which had been done them by venturing a timid: \"Don't you think that if you were just to stir out a little on really fine days...?\" or who, on the other hand, when she said to them: \"I am very low, very low; nearing the end, dear friends!\" had replied: \"Ah, yes, when one has no strength left! Still, you may last a while yet\"; each party alike might be certain that her doors would never open to them again. And if Fran\u00e7oise was amused by the look of consternation on my aunt's face whenever she saw, from her bed, any of these people in the Rue du Saint-Esprit, who looked as if they were coming to see her, or heard her own door-bell ring, she would laugh far more heartily, as at a clever trick, at my aunt's devices (which never failed) for having them sent away, and at their look of discomfiture when they had to turn back without having seen her; and would be filled with secret admiration for her mistress, whom she felt to be superior to all these other people, inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to see them. In short, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that whoever came to see her must approve of her way of life, commiserate with her in her sufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In all this Eulalie excelled. My aunt might say to her twenty times in a minute: \"The end is come at last, my poor Eulalie!\", twenty times Eulalie would retort with: \"Knowing your illness as you do, Mme. Octave, you will live to be a hundred, as Mme. Sazerin said to me only yesterday.\" For one of Eulalie's most rooted beliefs, and one that the formidable list of corrections which her experience must have compiled was powerless to eradicate, was that Mme. Sazerat's name was really Mme. Sazerin.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I do not ask to live to a hundred,\" my aunt would say, for she preferred to have no definite limit fixed to the number of her days.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And since, besides this, Eulalie knew, as no one else knew, how to distract my aunt without tiring her, her visits, which took place regularly every Sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent them, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on those days in a state of expectation, appetising enough to begin with, but at once changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if Eulalie were a minute late in coming. For, if unduly prolonged, the rapture of waiting for Eulalie became a torture, and my aunt would never cease from looking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of her symptoms in turn. Eulalie's ring, if it sounded from the front door at the very end of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would almost make her ill. For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of nothing else than this visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended Fran\u00e7oise would become impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that she might go upstairs to 'occupy' my aunt. But\u2014and this more than ever from the day on which fine weather definitely set in at Combray\u2014the proud hour \u00b0f noon, descending from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which it blazoned for a moment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown, would long have echoed about our table, beside the 'holy bread,' which too had come in, after church, in its familiar way; and we would still be found seated in front of our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down by the heat of the day, and even more by our heavy meal. For upon the permanent foundation of eggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and biscuits, whose appearance on the table she no longer announced to us, Fran\u00e7oise would add\u2014as the labour of fields and orchards, the harvest of the tides, the luck of the markets, the kindness of neighbours, and her own genius might provide; and so effectively that our bill of fare, like the quatrefoils that were carved on the porches of cathedrals in the thirteenth century, reflected to some extent the march of the seasons and the incidents of human life\u2014a brill, because the fish-woman had guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she had seen a beauty in the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with marrow, because she had never done them for us in that way before; a roast leg of mutton, because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be plenty of time for it to 'settle down' in the seven hours before dinner; spinach, by way of a change; apricots, because they were still hard to get; gooseberries, because in another fortnight there would be none left; raspberries, which M. Swann had brought specially; cherries, the first to come from the cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two years; a cream cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an almond cake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy loaf, because it was our turn to 'offer' the holy bread. And when all these had been eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but dedicated more particularly to my father, who had a fondness for such things, a cream of chocolate, inspired in the mind, created by the hand of Fran\u00e7oise, would be laid before us, light and fleeting as an 'occasional piece' of music, into which she had poured the whole of her talent. Anyone who refused to partake of it, saying: \"No, thank you, I have finished; I am not hungry,\" would at once have been lowered to the level of the Philistines who, when an artist makes them a present of one of his works, examine its weight and material, whereas what is of value is the creator's intention and his signature. To have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish would have shewn as much discourtesy as to rise and leave a concert hall while the 'piece' was still being played, and under the composer's-very eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At length my mother would say to me: \"Now, don't stay here all day; you can go up to your room if you are too hot outside, but get a little fresh air first; don't start reading immediately after your food.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And I would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough, ornamented here and there, like a gothic font, with a salamander, which modelled upon a background of crumbling stone the quick relief of its slender, allegorical body; on the bench without a back, in the shade of a lilac-tree, in that little corner of the garden which communicated, by a service door, with the Rue du Saint-Esprit, and from whose neglected soil rose, in two stages, an outcrop from the house itself and apparently a separate building, my aunt's back-kitchen. One could see its red-tiled floor gleaming like porphyry. It seemed not so much the cave of Fran\u00e7oise as a little temple of Venus. It would be overflowing with the offerings of the milkman, the fruiterer, the greengrocer, come sometimes from distant villages to dedicate here the first-fruits of their fields. And its roof was always surmounted by the cooing of a dove.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In earlier days I would not have lingered in the sacred grove which surrounded this temple, for, before going upstairs to read, I would steal into the little sitting-room which my uncle Adolphe, a brother of my grandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a major, used to occupy on the ground floor, a room which, even when its opened windows let in the heat, if not actually the rays of the sun which seldom penetrated so far, would never fail to emit that vague and yet fresh odour, suggesting at once an open-air and an old-fashioned kind of existence, which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one goes into a disused gun-room. But for some years now I had not gone into my uncle Adolphe's room, since he no longer came to Combray on account of a quarrel which had arisen between him and my family, by my fault, and in the following circumstances: Once or twice every month, in Paris, I used to be sent to pay him a. visit, as he was finishing his luncheon, wearing a plain alpaca coat, and waited upon by his servant in a working-jacket of striped linen, purple and white. He would complain that I had not been to see him for a long time; that he was being neglected; he would offer me a marchpane or a tangerine, and we would cross a room in which no one ever sat, whose fire was never lighted, whose walls were picked out with gilded mouldings, its ceiling painted blue in imitation of the sky, and its furniture upholstered in satin, as at my grandparents', only yellow; then we would enter what he called his 'study,' a room whose walls were hung with prints which shewed, against a dark background, a plump and rosy goddess driving a car, or standing upon a globe, or wearing a star on her brow; pictures which were popular under the Second Empire because there was thought to be something about them that suggested Pompeii, which were then generally despised, and which now people are beginning to collect again for one single and consistent reason (despite any others which they may advance), namely, that they suggest the Second Empire. And there I would stay with my uncle until his man came, with a message from the coachman, to ask him at what time he would like the carriage. My uncle would then be lost in meditation, while his astonished servant stood there, not daring to disturb him by the least movement, wondering and waiting for his answer, which never varied. For in the end, after a supreme crisis of hesitation, my uncle would utter, infallibly, the words: \"A quarter past two,\" which the servant would echo with amazement, but without disputing them: \"A quarter past two! Very good, sir... I will go and tell him....\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this date I was a lover of the theatre: a Platonic lover, of necessity, since my parents had not yet allowed me to enter one, and so incorrect was the picture I drew for myself of the pleasures to be enjoyed there that I almost believed that each of the spectators looked, as into a stereoscope, upon a stage and scenery which existed for himself alone, though closely resembling the thousand other spectacles presented to the rest of the audience individually.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every morning I would hasten to the Moriss column to see what new plays it announced. Nothing could be more disinterested or happier than the dreams with which these announcements filled my mind, dreams which took their form from the inevitable associations of the words forming the title of the play, and also from the colour of the bills, still damp and wrinkled with paste, on which those words stood out. Nothing, unless it were such strange titles as the Testament de C\u00e9sar Girodot, or Oedipe-Roi, inscribed not on the green bills of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, but on the wine-coloured bills of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, nothing seemed to me to differ more profoundly from the sparkling white plume of the Diamants de la Couronne than the sleek, mysterious satin of the Domino Noir and since my parents had told me that, for my first visit to the theatre, I should have to choose between these two pieces, I would study exhaustively and in turn the title of one and the title of the other (for those were all that I knew of either), attempting to snatch from each a foretaste of the pleasure which it offered me, and to compare this pleasure with that latent in the other title, until in the end I had shewn myself such vivid, such compelling pictures of, on the one hand, a play of dazzling arrogance, and on the other a gentle, velvety play, that I was as little capable of deciding which play I should prefer to see as if, at the dinner-table, they had obliged me to choose between rice \u00e0 l'Imp\u00e9ratrice and the famous cream of chocolate.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All my conversations with my playfellows bore upon actors, whose art, although as yet I had no experience of it, was the first of all its numberless forms in which Art itself allowed me to anticipate its enjoyment. Between one actor's tricks of intonation and inflection and another's, the most trifling differences would strike me as being of an incalculable importance. And from what I had been told of them I would arrange them in the order of their talent in lists which I used to murmur to myself all day long: lists which in the end became petrified in my brain and were a source of annoyance to it, being irremovable.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And later, in my schooldays, whenever I ventured in class, when the master's head was turned, to communicate with some new friend, I would always begin by asking him whether he had begun yet to go to theatres, and if he agreed that our greatest actor was undoubtedly Got, our second Delaunay, and so on. And if, in his judgment, Febvre came below Thiron, or Delaunay below Coquelin, the sudden volatility which the name of Coquelin, forsaking its stony rigidity, would engender in my mind, in which it moved upwards to the second place, the rich vitality with which the name of Delaunay would suddenly be furnished, to enable it to slip down to fourth, would stimulate and fertilise my brain with a sense of bradding and blossoming life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if the thought of actors weighed so upon me, if the sight of Maubant, coming out one afternoon from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais, had plunged me in the throes and sufferings of hopeless love, how much more did the name of a 'star,' blazing outside the doors of a theatre, how much more, seen through the window of a brougham which passed me in the street, the hair over her forehead abloom with roses, did the face of a woman who, I would think, was perhaps an actress, leave with me a lasting disturbance, a futile and painful effort to form a picture of her private life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I classified, in order of talent, the most distinguished: Sarah Bernhardt, Berma, Bartet, Madeleine Brohan, Jeanne Samary; but I was interested in them all. Now my uncle knew many of them personally, and also ladies of another class, not clearly distinguished from actresses in my mind. He used to entertain them at his house. And if we went to see him on certain days only, that was because on the other days ladies might come whom his family could not very well have met. So we at least thought; as for my uncle, his fatal readiness to pay pretty widows (who had perhaps never been married) and countesses (whose high-sounding titles were probably no more than noms de guerre) the compliment of presenting them to my grandmother or even of presenting to them some of our family jewels, had already embroiled him more than once with my grandfather. Often, if the name of some actress were mentioned in conversation, I would hear my father say, with a smile, to my mother: \"One of your uncle's friends,\" and I would think of the weary novitiate through which, perhaps for years on end, a grown man, even a man of real importance, might have to pass, waiting on the doorstep of some such lady, while she refused to answer his letters and made her hall-porter drive him away; and imagine that my uncle was able to dispense a little jackanapes like myself from all these sufferings by introducing me in his own home to the actress, unapproachable by all the world, but for him an intimate friend.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so\u2014on the pretext that some lesson, the hour of which had been altered, now came at such an awkward time that it had already more than once prevented me, and would continue to prevent me, from seeing my uncle\u2014one day, not one of the days which he set apart for our visits, I took advantage of the fact that my parents had had luncheon earlier than usual; I slipped out and, instead of going to read the playbills on their column, for which purpose I was allowed to go out unaccompanied, I ran all the way to his house. I noticed before his door a carriage and pair, with red carnations on the horses' blinkers and in the coachman's buttonhole. As I climbed the staircase I could hear laughter and a woman's voice, and, as soon as I had rung, silence and the sound of shutting doors. The man-servant who let me in appeared embarrassed, and said that my uncle was extremely busy and probably could not see me; he went in, however, to announce my arrival, and the same voice I had heard before said: \"Oh, yes! Do let him come in; just for a moment; it will be so amusing. Is that his photograph there, on your desk? And his mother (your niece, isn't she?) beside it? The image of her, isn't he? I should so like to see the little chap, just for a second.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could hear my uncle grumbling and growing angry; finally the manservant told me to come in.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the table was the same plate of marchpanes that was always there; my uncle wore the same alpaca coat as on other days; but opposite to him, in a pink silk dress with a great necklace of pearls about her throat, sat a young woman who was just finishing a tangerine. My uncertainty whether I ought to address her as Madame or Mademoiselle made me blush, and not daring to look too much in her direction, in case I should be obliged to speak to her, I hurried across to kiss my uncle. She looked at me and smiled; my uncle said \"My nephew!\" without telling her my name or telling me hers, doubtless because, since his difficulties with my grandfather, he had endeavoured as far as possible to avoid any association of his family with this other class of acquaintance.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How like his mother he is,\" said the lady.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But you have never seen my niece, except in photographs,\" my uncle broke in quickly, with a note of anger.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I beg your pardon, dear friend, I passed her on the staircase last year when you were so ill. It is true I only saw her for a moment, and your staircase is rather dark; but I saw well enough to see how lovely she was. This young gentleman has her beautiful eyes, and also this,\" she went on, tracing a line with one finger across the lower part of her forehead. \"Tell me,\" she asked my uncle, \"is your niece Mme.\u2014\u2014; is her name the same as yours?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He takes most after his father,\" muttered my uncle, who was no more anxious to effect an introduction by proxy, in repeating Mamma's name aloud, than to bring the two together in the flesh. \"He's his father all over, and also like my poor mother.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I have not met his father, dear,\" said the lady in pink, bowing her head slightly, \"and I never saw your poor mother. You will remember it was just after your great sorrow that we got to know one another.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt somewhat disillusioned, for this young lady was in no way different from other pretty women whom I had seen from time to time at home, especially the daughter of one of our cousins, to whose house I went every New Year's Day. Only better dressed; otherwise my uncle's friend had the same quick and kindly glance, the same frank and friendly manner. I could find no trace in her of the theatrical appearance which I admired in photographs of actresses, nothing of the diabolical expression which would have been in keeping with the life she must lead. I had difficulty in believing that this was one of 'those women,' and certainly I should never have believed her one of the 'smart ones' had I not seen the carriage and pair, the pink dress, the pearly necklace, had I not been aware, too, that my uncle knew only the very best of them. But I asked myself how the millionaire who gave her her carriage and her flat and her jewels could find any pleasure in flinging his money away upon a woman who had so simple and respectable an appearance. And yet, when I thought of what her life must be like, its immorality disturbed me more, perhaps, than if it had stood before me in some concrete and recognisable form, by its secrecy and invisibility, like the plot of a novel, the hidden truth of a scandal which had driven out of the home of her middle-class parents and dedicated to the service of all mankind which had brought to the flowering-point of her beauty, had raised to fame or notoriety this woman, the play of whose features, the intonations of whose voice, like so many others I already knew, made me regard her, in spite of myself, as a young lady of good family, her who was no longer of a family at all.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We had gone by this time into the 'study,' and my uncle, who seemed a trifle embarrassed by my presence, offered her a cigarette.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, thank you, dear friend,\" she said. \"You know I only smoke the ones the Grand Duke sends me. I tell him that they make you jealous.\" And she drew from a case cigarettes covered with inscriptions in gold, in a foreign language. \"Why, yes,\" she began again suddenly. \"Of course I have met this young man's father with you. Isn't he your nephew? How on earth could I have forgotten? He was so nice, so charming to me,\" she went on, modestly and with feeling. But when I thought to myself what must actually have been the rude greeting (which, she made out, had been so charming), I, who knew my father's coldness and reserve, was shocked, as though at some indelicacy on his part, at the contrast between the excessive recognition bestowed on it and his never adequate geniality. It has since struck me as one of the most touching aspects of the part played in life by these idle, painstaking women that they devote all their generosity, all their talent, their transferable dreams of sentimental beauty (for, like all artists, they never seek to realise the value of those dreams, or to enclose them in the four-square frame of everyday life), and their gold, which counts for little, to the fashioning of a fine and precious setting for the rubbed and scratched and ill-polished lives of men. And just as this one filled the smoking-room, where my uncle was entertaining her in his alpaca coat, with her charming person, her dress of pink silk, her pearls, and the refinement suggested by intimacy with a Grand Duke, so, in the same way, she had taken some casual remark by my father, had worked it up delicately, given it a 'turn,' a precious title, set in it the gem of a glance from her own eyes, a gem of the first water, blended of humility and gratitude; and so had given it back transformed into a jewel, a work of art, into something altogether charming.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Look here, my boy, it is time you went away,\" said my uncle.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I rose; I could scarcely resist a desire to kiss the hand of the lady in pink, but I felt that to do so would require as much audacity as a forcible abduction of her. My heart beat loud while I counted out to myself \"Shall I do it, shall I not?\" and then I ceased to ask myself what I ought to do so as at least to do something. Blindly, hotly, madly, flinging aside all the reasons I had just found to support such action, I seized and raised to my lips the hand she held out to me.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Isn't he delicious! Quite a ladies' man already; he takes after his uncle. He'll be a perfect 'gentleman,'\" she went on, setting her teeth so as to give the word a kind of English accentuation. \"Couldn't he come to me some day for 'a cup of tea,' as our friends across the channel say; he need only send me a 'blue' in the morning?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had not the least idea of what a 'blue' might be. I did not understand half the words which the lady used, but my fear lest there should be concealed in them some question which it would be impolite in me not to answer kept me from withdrawing my close attention from them, and I was beginning to feel extremely tired.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, no; it is impossible,\" said my uncle, shrugging his shoulders. \"He is kept busy at home all day; he has plenty of work to do. He brings back all the prizes from his school,\" he added in a lower tone, so that I should not hear this falsehood and interrupt with a contradiction. \"You can't tell; he may turn out a little Victor Hugo, a kind of Vaulabelle, don't you know.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I love artistic people,\" replied the lady in pink; \"there is no one like them for understanding women. Them, and really nice men like yourself. But please forgive my ignorance. Who, what is Vaulabelle? Is it those gilt books in the little glass case in your drawing-room? You know you promised to lend them to me; I will take great care of them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My uncle, who hated lending people books, said nothing, and ushered me out into the hall. Madly in love with the lady in pink, I covered my old uncle's tobacco-stained cheeks with passionate kisses, and while he, awkwardly enough, gave me to understand (without actually saying) that he would rather I did not tell my parents about this visit, I assured him, with tears in my eyes, that his kindness had made so strong an impression upon me that some day I would most certainly find a way of expressing my gratitude. So strong an impression had it made upon me that two hours later, after a string of mysterious utterances which did not strike me as giving my parents a sufficiently clear idea of the new importance with which I had been invested, I found it simpler to let them have a full account, omitting no detail, of the visit I had paid that afternoon. In doing this I had no thought of causing my uncle any unpleasantness. How could I have thought such a thing, since I did not wish it? And I could not suppose that my parents would see any harm in a visit in which I myself saw none. Every day of our lives does not some friend or other ask us to make his apologies, without fail, to some woman to whom he has been prevented from writing; and do not we forget to do so, feeling that this woman cannot attach much importance to a silence which has none for ourselves? I imagined, like everyone else, that the brains of other people were lifeless and submissive receptacles with no power of specific reaction to any stimulus which might be applied to them; and I had not the least doubt that when I deposited in the minds of my parents the news of the acquaintance I had made at my uncle's I should at the same time transmit to them the kindly judgment I myself had based on the introduction. Unfortunately my parents had recourse to principles entirely different from those which I suggested they should adopt when they came to form their estimate of my uncle's conduct. My father and grandfather had 'words' with him of a violent order; as I learned indirectly. A few days later, passing my uncle in the street as he drove by in an open carriage, \u00ce felt at once all the grief, the gratitude, the remorse which I should have liked to convey to him. Beside the immensity of these emotions I considered that merely to raise my hat to him would be incongruous and petty, and might make him think that I regarded myself as bound to shew him no more than the commonest form of courtesy. I decided to abstain from so inadequate a gesture, and turned my head away. My uncle thought that, in doing so I was obeying my parents' orders; he never forgave them; and though he did not die until many years later, not one of us ever set eyes on him again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so I no longer used to go into the little sitting-room (now kept shut) of my uncle Adolphe; instead, after hanging about on the outskirts of the back-kitchen until Fran\u00e7oise appeared on its threshold and announced: \"I am going to let the kitchen-maid serve the coffee and take up the hot water; it is time I went off to Mme. Octave,\" I would then decide to go indoors, and would go straight upstairs to my room to read. The kitchen-maid was an abstract personality, a permanent institution to which an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and continuity and identity throughout the long series of transitory human shapes in which that personality was incarnate; for we never found the same girl there two years running. In the year in which we ate such quantities of asparagus, the kitchen-maid whose duty it was to dress them was a poor sickly creature, some way 'gone' in pregnancy when we arrived at Combray for Easter, and it was indeed surprising that Fran\u00e7oise allowed her to run so many errands in the town and to do so much work in the house, for she was beginning to find a difficulty in bearing before her the mysterious casket, fuller and larger every day, whose splendid outline could be detected through the folds of her ample smocks. These last recalled the cloaks in which Giotto shrouds some of the allegorical figures in his paintings, of which M. Swann had given me photographs. He it was who pointed out the resemblance, and when he inquired after the kitchen-maid he would say: \"Well, how goes it with Giotto's Charity?\" And indeed the poor girl, whose pregnancy had swelled and stoutened every part of her, even to her face, and the vertical, squared outlines of her cheeks, did distinctly suggest those virgins, so strong and mannish as to seem matrons rather, in whom the Virtues are personified in the Arena Chapel. And I can see now that those Virtues and Vices of Padua resembled her in another respect as well. For just as the figure of this girl had been enlarged by the additional symbol which she carried in her body, without appearing to understand what it meant, without any rendering in her facial expression of all its beauty and spiritual significance, but carried as if it were an ordinary and rather heavy burden, so it is without any apparent suspicion of what she is about that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed in the Arena beneath the label 'Caritas,' and a reproduction of whose portrait hung upon the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, incarnates that virtue, for it seems impossible, that any thought of charity can ever have found expression in her vulgar and energetic face. By a fine stroke of the painter's invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at her feet, but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a wine-press to extract their juice, or, still more, as if she had climbed on a heap of sacks to raise herself higher; and she is holding out her flaming heart to God, or shall we say 'handing' it to Him, exactly as a cook might hand up a corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to some one who had called down to ask her for it from the ground-level above. The 'Invidia,' again, should have had some look on her face of envy. But in this fresco, too, the symbol occupies so large a place and is represented with such realism; the serpent hissing between the lips of Envy is so huge, and so completely fills her wide-opened mouth that the muscles of her face are strained and contorted, like a child's who is filling a balloon with his breath, and that Envy, and we ourselves for that matter, when we look at her, since all her attention and ours are concentrated on the action of her lips, have no time, almost, to spare for envious thoughts.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite all the admiration that M. Swann might profess for these figures of Giotto, it was a long time before I could find any pleasure in seeing in our schoolroom (where the copies he had brought me were hung) that Charity devoid of charity, that Envy who looked like nothing so much as a plate in some medical book, illustrating the compression of the glottis or uvula by a tumour in the tongue, or by the introduction of the operator's instrument, a Justice whose greyish and meanly regular features were the very same as those which adorned the faces of certain good and pious and slightly withered ladies of Combray whom I used to see at mass, many of whom had long been enrolled in the reserve forces of Injustice. But in later years I understood that the arresting strangeness, the special beauty of these frescoes lay in the great part played in each of them by its symbols, while the fact that these were depicted, not as symbols (for the thought symbolised was nowhere expressed), but as real things, actually felt or materially handled, added something more precise and more literal to their meaning, something more concrete and more striking to the lesson they imparted. And even in the case of the poor kitchen-maid, was not our attention incessantly drawn to her belly by the load which filled it; and in the same way, again, are not the thoughts of men and women in the agony of death often turned towards the practical, painful, obscure, internal, intestinal aspect, towards that 'seamy side' of death which is, as it happens, the side that death actually presents to them and forces them to feel, a side which far more closely resembles a crushing burden, a difficulty in breathing, a destroying thirst, than the abstract idea to which we are accustomed to give the name of Death?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There must have been a strong element of reality in those Virtues and Vices of Padua, since they appeared to me to be as much alive as the pregnant servant-girl, while she herself appeared scarcely less allegorical than they. And, quite possibly, this lack (or seeming lack) of participation by a person's soul in the significant marks of its own special virtue has, apart from its aesthetic meaning, a reality which, if not strictly psychological, may at least be called physiognomical. Later on, when, in the course of my life, I have had occasion to meet with, in convents for instance, literally saintly examples of practical charity, they have generally had the brisk, decided, undisturbed, and slightly brutal air of a busy surgeon, the face in which one can discern no commiseration, no tenderness at the sight of suffering humanity, and no fear of hurting it, the face devoid of gentleness or sympathy, the sublime face of true goodness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then while the kitchen-maid\u2014who, all unawares, made the superior qualities of Fran\u00e7oise shine with added lustre, just as Error, by force of contrast, enhances the triumph of Truth\u2014took in coffee which (according to Mamma) was nothing more than hot water, and then carried up to our rooms hot water which was barely tepid, I would be lying stretched out on my bed, a book in my hand, in my room which trembled with the effort to defend its frail, transparent coolness against the afternoon sun, behind its almost closed shutters through which, however, a reflection of the sunlight had contrived to slip in on its golden wings, remaining motionless, between glass and woodwork, in a corner, like a butterfly poised upon a flower. It was hardly light enough for me to read, and my feeling of the day's brightness and splendour was derived solely from the blows struck down below, in the Rue de la Cur\u00e9, by Camus (whom Fran\u00e7oise had assured that my aunt was not 'resting' and that he might therefore make a noise), upon some old packing-cases from which nothing would really be sent flying but the dust, though the din of them, in the resonant atmosphere that accompanies hot weather, seemed to scatter broadcast a rain of blood-red stars; and from the flies who performed for my benefit, in their small concert, as it might be the chamber music of summer; evoking heat and light quite differently from an air of human music which, if you happen to have heard it during a fine summer, will always bring that summer back to your mind, the flies' music is bound to the season by a closer, a more vital tie\u2014born of sunny days, and not to be reborn but with them, containing something of their essential nature, it not merely calls up their image in our memory, but gives us a guarantee that they do really exist, that they are close around us, immediately accessible.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This dim freshness of my room was to the broad daylight of the street what the shadow is to the sunbeam, that is to say, equally luminous, and presented to my imagination the entire panorama of summer, which my senses, if I had been out walking, could have tasted and enjoyed in fragments only; and so was quite in harmony with my state of repose, which (thanks to the adventures related in my books, which had just excited it) bore, like a hand reposing motionless in a stream of running water, the shock and animation of a torrent of activity and life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But my grandmother, even if the weather, after growing too hot, had broken, and a storm, or just a shower, had burst over us, would come up and beg me to go outside. And as I did not wish to leave off my book, I would go on with it in the garden, under the chestnut-tree, in a little sentry-box of canvas and matting, in the farthest recesses of which I used to sit and feel that I was hidden from the eyes of anyone who might be coming to call upon the family.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then my thoughts, did not they form a similar sort of hiding-hole, in the depths of which I felt that I could bury myself and remain invisible even when I was looking at what went on outside? When I saw any external object, my consciousness that I was seeing it would remain between me and it, enclosing it in a slender, incorporeal outline which prevented me from ever coming directly in contact with the material form; for it would volatilise itself in some way before I could touch it, just as an incandescent body which is moved towards something wet never actually touches moisture, since it is always preceded, itself, by a zone of evaporation. Upon the sort of screen, patterned with different states and impressions, which my consciousness would quietly unfold while I was reading, and which ranged from the most deeply hidden aspirations of my heart to the wholly external view of the horizon spread out before my eyes at the foot of the garden, what was from the first the most permanent and the most intimate part of me, the lever whose incessant movements controlled all the rest, was my belief in the philosophic richness and beauty of the book I was reading, and my desire to appropriate these to myself, whatever the book might be. For even if I had purchased it at Combray, having seen it outside Borange's, whose grocery lay too far from our house for Fran\u00e7oise to be able to deal there, as she did with Camus, but who enjoyed better custom as a stationer and bookseller; even if I had seen it, tied with string to keep it in its place in the mosaic of monthly parts and pamphlets which adorned either side of his doorway, a doorway more mysterious, more teeming with suggestion than that of a cathedral, I should have noticed and bought it there simply because I had recognised it as a book which had been well spoken of, in my hearing, by the school-master or the school-friend who, at that particular time, seemed to me to be entrusted with the secret of Truth and Beauty, things half-felt by me, half-incomprehensible, the full understanding of which was the vague but permanent object of my thoughts.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next to this central belief, which, while I was reading, would be constantly a motion from my inner self to the outer world, towards the discovery of Truth, came the emotions aroused in me by the action in which I would be taking part, for these afternoons were crammed with more dramatic and sensational events than occur, often, in a whole lifetime. These were the events which took place in the book I was reading. It is true that the people concerned in them were not what Fran\u00e7oise would have called 'real people.' But none of the feelings which the joys or misfortunes of a 'real' person awaken in us can be awakened except through a mental picture of those joys or misfortunes; and the ingenuity of the first novelist lay in his understanding that, as the picture was the one essential element in the complicated structure of our emotions, so that simplification of it which consisted in the suppression, pure and simple, of 'real' people would be a decided improvement. A 'real' person, profoundly as we may sympathise with him, is in a great measure perceptible only through our senses, that is to say, he remains opaque, offers a dead weight which our sensibilities have not the strength to lift. If some misfortune comes to him, it is only in one small section of the complete idea we have of him that we are capable of feeling any emotion; indeed it is only in one small section of the complete idea he has of himself that he is capable of feeling any emotion either. The novelist's happy discovery was to think of substituting for those opaque sections, impenetrable by the human spirit, their equivalent in immaterial sections, things, that is, which the spirit can assimilate to itself. After which it matters not that the actions, the feelings of this new order of creatures appear to us in the guise of truth, since we have made them our own, since it is in ourselves that they are happening, that they are holding in thrall, while we turn over, feverishly, the pages of the book, our quickened breath and staring eyes. And once the novelist has brought us to that state, in which, as in all purely mental states, every emotion is multiplied ten-fold, into which his book comes to disturb us as might a dream, but a dream more lucid, and of a more lasting impression than those which come to us in sleep; why, then, for the space of an hour he sets free within us all the joys and sorrows in the world, a few of which, only, we should have to spend years of our actual life in getting to know, and the keenest, the most intense of which would never have been revealed to us because the slow course of their development stops our perception of them. It is the same in life; the heart changes, and that is our worst misfortune; but we learn of it only from reading or by imagination; for in reality its alteration, like that of certain natural phenomena, is so gradual that, even if we are able to distinguish, successively, each of its different states, we are still spared the actual sensation of change.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next to, but distinctly less intimate a part of myself than this human element, would come the view, more or less projected before my eyes, of the country in which the action of the story was taking place, which made a far stronger impression on my mind than the other, the actual landscape which would meet my eyes when I raised them from my book. In this way, for two consecutive summers I used to sit in the heat of our Combray garden, sick with a longing inspired by the book I was then reading for a land of mountains and rivers, where I could see an endless vista of sawmills, where beneath the limpid currents fragments of wood lay mouldering in beds of watercress; and nearby, rambling and clustering along low walls, purple flowers and red. And since there was always lurking in my mind the dream of a woman who would enrich me with her love, that dream in those two summers used to be quickened with the freshness and coolness of running water; and whoever she might be, the woman whose image I called to mind, purple flowers and red would at once spring up on either side of her like complementary colours.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever distinguished, is adorned and enriched by the association of colours not its own which may happen to surround it in our mental picture; for the scenes in the books I read were to me not merely scenery more vividly portrayed by my imagination than any which Combray could spread before my eyes but otherwise of the same kind. Because of the selection that the author had made of them, because of the spirit of faith in which my mind would exceed and anticipate his printed word, as it might be interpreting a revelation, these scenes used to give me the impression\u2014one which I hardly ever derived from any place in which I might happen to be, and never from our garden, that undistinguished product of the strictly conventional fantasy of the gardener whom my grandmother so despised\u2014of their being actually part of Nature herself, and worthy to be studied and explored.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had my parents allowed me, when I read a book, to pay a visit to the country it described, I should have felt that I was making an enormous advance towards the ultimate conquest of truth. For even if we have the sensation of being always enveloped in, surrounded by our own soul, still it does not seem a fixed and immovable prison; rather do we seem to be borne away with it, and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it, to break out into the world, with a perpetual discouragement as we hear endlessly, all around us, that unvarying sound which is no echo from without, but the resonance of a vibration from within. We try to discover in things, endeared to us on that account, the spiritual glamour which we ourselves have cast upon them; we are disillusioned, and learn that they are in themselves barren and devoid of the charm which they owed, in our minds, to the association of certain ideas; sometimes we mobilise all our spiritual forces in a glittering array so as to influence and subjugate other human beings who, as we very well know, are situated outside ourselves, where we can never reach them. And so, if I always imagined the woman I loved as in a setting of whatever places I most longed, at the time, to visit; if in my secret longings it was she who attracted me to them, who opened to me the gate of an unknown world, that was not by the mere hazard of a simple association of thoughts; no, it was because my dreams of travel and of love were only moments\u2014which I isolate artificially to-day as though I were cutting sections, at different heights, in a jet of water, rainbow-flashing but seemingly without flow or motion\u2014were only drops in a single, undeviating, irresistible outrush of all the forces of my life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, as I continue to trace the outward course of these impressions from their close-packed intimate source in my consciousness, and before I come to the horizon of reality which envelops them, I discover pleasures of another kind, those of being comfortably seated, of tasting the good scent on the air, of not being disturbed by any visitor; and, when an hour chimed from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, of watching what was already spent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until I heard the last stroke which enabled me to add up the total sum, after which the silence that followed seemed to herald the beginning, in the blue sky above me, of that long part of the day still allowed me for reading, until the good dinner which Fran\u00e7oise was even now preparing should come to strengthen and refresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero through the pages of my book. And, as each hour struck, it would seem to me that a few seconds only had passed since the hour before; the latest would inscribe itself, close to its predecessor, on the sky's surface, and I would be unable to believe that sixty minutes could be squeezed into the tiny arc of blue which was comprised between their two golden figures. Sometimes it would even happen that this precocious hour would sound two strokes more than the last; there must then have been an hour which I had not heard strike; something which had taken place had not taken place for me; the fascination of my book, a magic as potent as the deepest slumber, had stopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated the sound of that golden bell from the azure surface of the enveloping silence. Sweet Sunday afternoons beneath the chestnut-tree in our Combray garden, from which I was careful to eliminate every commonplace incident of my actual life, replacing them by a career of strange adventures and ambitions in a land watered by living streams, you still recall those adventures and ambitions to my mind when I think of you, and you embody and preserve them by virtue of having little by little drawn round and enclosed them (while I went on with my book and the heat of the day declined) in the gradual crystallisation, slowly altering in form and dappled with a pattern of chestnut-leaves, of your silent, sonorous, fragrant, limpid hours.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I would be torn from my book, in the middle of the afternoon, by the gardener's daughter, who came running like a mad thing, overturning an orange-tree in its tub, cutting a finger, breaking a tooth, and screaming out \"They're coming, they're coming!\" so that Fran\u00e7oise and I should run too and not miss anything of the show. That was on days when the cavalry stationed in Combray went out for some military exercise, going as a rule by the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While our servants, sitting in a row on their chairs outside the garden railings, stared at the people of Combray taking their Sunday walks and were stared at in return, the gardener's daughter, through the gap which there was between two houses far away in the Avenue de la Gare, would have spied the glitter of helmets. The servants then hurried in with their chairs, for when the troopers filed through the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde they filled it from side to side, and their jostling horses scraped against the walls of the houses, covering and drowning the pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel to a river in flood.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Poor children,\" Fran\u00e7oise would exclaim, in tears almost before she had reached the railings; \"poor boys, to be mown down like grass in a meadow. It's just shocking to think of,\" she would go on, laying a hand over her heart, where presumably she had felt the shock.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A fine sight, isn't it, Mme. Fran\u00e7oise, all these young fellows not caring two straws for their lives?\" the gardener would ask, just to 'draw' her. And he would not have spoken in vain.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Not caring for their lives, is it? Why, what in the world is there that we should care for if it's not our lives, the only gift the Lord never offers us a second time? Oh dear, oh dear; you're right all the same; it's quite true, they don't care! I can remember them in '70; in those wretched wars they've no fear of death left in them; they're nothing more nor less than madmen; and then they aren't worth the price of a rope to hang them with; they're not men any more, they're lions.\" For by her way of thinking, to compare a man with a lion, which she used to pronounce 'lie-on,' was not at all complimentary to the man.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Rue Sainte-Hildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see people approaching at any distance, and it was only through the gap between those two houses in the Avenue de la Gare that we could still make out fresh helmets racing along towards us, and flashing in the sunlight. The gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to come, and he was thirsty besides, with the sun beating down upon his head. So then, suddenly, his daughter would leap out, as though from a beleaguered city, would make a sortie, turn the street corner, and, having risked her life a hundred times over, reappear and bring us, with a jug of liquorice-water, the news that there were still at least a thousand of them, pouring along without a break from the direction of Thiberzy and M\u00e9s\u00e9glise. Fran\u00e7oise and the gardener, having 'made up' their difference, would discuss the line to be followed in case of war.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't you see, Fran\u00e7oise,\" he would say. \"Revolution would be better, because then no one would need to join in unless he liked.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, yes, I can see that, certainly; it's more straightforward.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The gardener believed that, as soon as war was declared, they would stop all the railways.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, to be sure; so that we sha'n't get away,\" said Fran\u00e7oise.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the gardener would assent, with \"Ay, they're the cunning ones,\" for he would not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the state attempted to play on the people, or that there was a man in the world who would not run away from it if he had the chance to do so.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Fran\u00e7oise would hasten back to my aunt, and I would return to my book, and the servants would take their places again outside the gate to watch the dust settle on the pavement, and the excitement caused by the passage of the soldiers subside. Long after order had been restored, an abnormal tide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of Corn-bray. And in front of every house, even of those where it was not, as a rule, 'done,' the servants, and sometimes even the masters would sit and stare, festooning their doorsteps with a dark, irregular fringe, like the border of shells and sea-weed which a stronger tide than usual leaves on the beach, as though trimming it with embroidered crape, when the sea itself has retreated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except on such days as these, however, I would as a rule be left to read in peace. But the interruption which a visit from Swann once made, and the commentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading, which had brought me to the work of an author quite new to me, called Bergotte, had this definite result that for a long time afterwards it was not against a wall gay with spikes of purple blossom, but on a wholly different background, the porch of a gothic cathedral, that I would see outlined the figure of one of the women of whom I dreamed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had heard Bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older than myself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the name of Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the Nuit d'Octobre, he had burst out in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me, by way of warning: \"You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset, Esquire. He is a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable specimen. I am bound to admit, natheless,\" he added graciously, \"that he, and even the man Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is not only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is in my eyes the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing. One is\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0La blanche Oloossone et la blanche Camire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0La fille de Minos et de Pasipha\u00eb.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They were submitted to my judgment, as evidence for the defence of the two runagates, in an article by my very dear master Father Lecomte, who is found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token, here is a book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book recommended, it would seem, by that colossal fellow. He regards, or so they tell me, its author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe, more subtle, indeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he exhibits on occasion a critical pacifism, a tenderness in suffering fools, for which it is impossible to account, and hard to make allowance, still his word has weight with me as it were the Delphic Oracle. Read you then this lyrical prose, and, if the Titanic master-builder of rhythm who composed Bhagavat and the L\u00e9vrier de Magnus speaks not falsely, then, by Apollo, you may taste, even you, my master, the ambrosial joys of Olympus.\" It was in an ostensible vein of sarcasm that he had asked me to call him, and that he himself called me, \"my master.\" But, as a matter of fact, we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism, being still at the age in which one believes that one gives a thing real existence by giving it a name.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately I was not able to set at rest, by further talks with Bloch, in which I might have insisted upon an explanation, the doubts he had engendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry (from which I, if you please, expected nothing less than the revelation of truth itself) were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing. For, as it happened, Bloch was not invited to the house again. At first, he had been well received there. It is true that my grandfather made out that, whenever I formed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and brought him home with me, that friend was invariably a Jew; to which he would not have objected on principle\u2014indeed his own friend Swann was of Jewish extraction\u2014had he not found that the Jews whom I chose as friends were not usually of the best type. And so I was hardly ever able to bring a new friend home without my grandfather's humming the \"O, God of our fathers\" from La Juive, or else \"Israel, break thy chain,\" singing the tune alone, of course, to an \"um-ti-tum-ti-tum, tra-la\"; but I used to be afraid of my friend's recognising the sound, and so being able to reconstruct the words.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before seeing them, merely on hearing their names, about which, as often as not, there was nothing particularly Hebraic, he would divine not only the Jewish origin of such of my friends as might indeed be of the chosen people, but even some dark secret which was hidden in their family.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And what do they call your friend who is coming this evening?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Dumont, grandpapa.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Dumont! Oh, I'm frightened of Dumont.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he would sing:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Archers, be on your guard!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Watch without rest, without sound.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, after a few adroit questions on points of detail, he would call out \"On guard! on guard,\" or, if it were the victim himself who had already arrived, and had been obliged, unconsciously, by my grandfather's subtle examination, to admit his origin, then my grandfather, to shew us that he had no longer any doubts, would merely look at us, humming almost inaudibly the air of\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  What! do you hither guide the feet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of this timid Israelite?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or of\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sweet vale of Hebron, dear paternal fields\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or, perhaps, of\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I am of the chosen race\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These little eccentricities on my grandfather's part implied no ill-will whatsoever towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for other reasons. He had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come in with wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, M. Bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining? I can't understand it; the barometer has been 'set fair.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which drew from Bloch nothing more instructive than \"Sir, I am absolutely incapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so resolutely apart from physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me of them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My poor boy,\" said my father after Bloch had gone, \"your friend is out of his mind. Why, he couldn't even tell me what the weather was like. As if there could be anything more interesting! He is an imbecile.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, Bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when she complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped the tears from his eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You cannot imagine that he is sincere,\" she observed to me. \"Why he doesn't know me. Unless he's mad, of course.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour and a half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and made not the least apology, saying merely: \"I never allow myself to be influenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or by the arbitrary divisions of what is known as Time. I would willingly reintroduce to society the opium pipe of China or the Malayan kriss, but I am wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more pernicious (besides being quite bleakly bourgeois) implements, the umbrella and the watch.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In spite of all this he would still have been received at Combray. He was, of course, hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for me; they had, in the end, decided that the tears which he had shed on hearing of my grandmother's illness were genuine enough; but they knew, either instinctively or from their own experience, that our early impulsive emotions have but little influence over our later actions and the conduct of our lives; and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty to our friends, patience in finishing our work, obedience to a rule of life, have a surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly followed than in these momentary transports, ardent but sterile. They would have preferred to Bloch, as companions for myself, boys who would have given me no more than it is proper, by all the laws of middle-class morality, for boys to give one another, who would not unexpectedly send me a basket of fruit because they happened, that morning, to have thought of me with affection, but who, since they were incapable of inclining in my favour, by any single impulse of their imagination and emotions, the exact balance of the duties and claims of friendship, were as incapable of loading the scales to my prejudice. Even the injuries we do them will not easily divert from the path of their duty towards us those conventional natures of which my great-aunt furnished a type: who, after quarrelling for years with a niece, to whom she never spoke again, yet made no change in the will in which she had left that niece the whole of her fortune, because she was her next-of-kin, and it was the 'proper thing' to do.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But I was fond of Bloch; my parents wished me to be happy; and the insoluble problems which I set myself on such texts as the 'absolutely meaningless' beauty of La fille de Minos et de Pasipha\u00ebtired me more and made me more unwell than I should have been after further talks with him, unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother's mind. And he would still have been received at Combray but for one thing. That same night, after dinner, having informed me (a piece of news which had a great influence on my later life, making it happier at one time and then more unhappy) that no woman ever thought of anything but love, and that there was not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome, he had gone on to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable authority that my great-aunt herself had led a 'gay' life in her younger days, and had been notoriously 'kept.' I could not refrain from passing on so important a piece of information to my parents; the next time Bloch called he was not admitted, and afterwards, when I met him in the street, he greeted me with extreme coldness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But in the matter of Bergotte he had spoken truly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the first few days, like a tune which will be running in one's head and maddening one soon enough, but of which one has not for the moment 'got hold,' the things I was to love so passionately in Bergotte's style had not yet caught my eye. I could not, it is true, lay down the novel of his which I was reading, but I fancied that I was interested in the story alone, as in the first dawn of love, when we go every day to meet a woman at some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine it is that we are attracted. Then I observed the rare, almost archaic phrases which he liked to employ at certain points, where a hidden flow of harmony, a prelude contained and concealed in the work itself would animate and elevate his style; and it was at such points as these, too, that he would begin to speak of the \"vain dream of life,\" of the \"inexhaustible torrent of fair forms,\" of the \"sterile, splendid torture of understanding and loving,\" of the \"moving effigies which ennoble for all time the charming and venerable fronts of our cathedrals\"; that he would express a whole system of philosophy, new to me, by the use of marvellous imagery, to the inspiration of which I would naturally have ascribed that sound of harping which began to chime and echo in my ears, an accompaniment to which that imagery added something ethereal and sublime. One of these passages of Bergotte, the third or fourth which I had detached from the rest, filled me with a joy to which the meagre joy I had tasted in the first passage bore no comparison, a joy which I felt myself to have experienced in some innermost chamber of my soul, deep, undivided, vast, from which all obstructions and partitions seemed to have been swept away. For what had happened was that, while I recognised in this passage the same taste for uncommon phrases, the same bursts of music, the same idealist philosophy which had been present in the earlier passages without my having taken them into account as the source of my pleasure, I now no longer had the impression of being confronted by a particular passage in one of Bergotte's works, which traced a purely bi-dimensional figure in outline upon the surface of my mind, but rather of the 'ideal passage' of Bergotte, common to every one of his books, and to which all the earlier, similar passages, now becoming merged in it, had added a kind of density and volume, by which my own understanding seemed to be enlarged.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was by no means Bergotte's sole admirer; he was the favourite writer also of a friend of my mother's, a highly literary lady; while Dr. du Boulbon had kept all his patients waiting until he finished Bergotte's latest volume; and it was from his consulting room, and from a house in a park near Combray that some of the first seeds were scattered of that taste for Bergotte, a rare-growth in those days, but now so universally acclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout Europe and America, and even in the tiniest villages, rare still in its refinement, but in that alone. What my mother's friend, and, it would seem, what Dr. du Boulbon liked above all in the writings of Bergotte was just what I liked, the same flow of melody, the same old-fashioned phrases, and certain others, quite simple and familiar, but so placed by him, in such prominence, as to hint at a particular quality of taste on his part; and also, in the sad parts of his books, a sort of roughness, a tone that was almost harsh. And he himself, no doubt, realised that these were his principal attractions. For in his later books, if he had hit upon some great truth, or upon the name of an historic cathedral, he would break off his narrative, and in an invocation, an apostrophe, a lengthy prayer, would give a free outlet to that effluence which, in the earlier volumes, remained buried beneath the form of his prose, discernible only in a rippling of its surface, and perhaps even more delightful, more harmonious when it was thus veiled from the eye, when the reader could give no precise indication of where the murmur of the current began, or of where it died away. These passages in which he delighted were our favourites also. For my own part I knew all of them by heart. I felt even disappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative. Whenever he spoke of something whose beauty had until then remained hidden from me, of pine-forests or of hailstorms, of Notre-Dame de Paris, of Athalie, or of Ph\u00e8dre, by some piece of imagery he would make their beauty explode and drench me with its essence. And so, dimly realising that the universe contained innumerable elements which my feeble senses would be powerless to discern, did he not bring them within my reach, I wished that I might have his opinion, some metaphor of his, upon everything in the world, and especially upon such things as I might have an opportunity, some day, of seeing for myself; and among such things, more particularly still upon some of the historic buildings of France, upon certain views of the sea, because the emphasis with which, in his books, he referred to these shewed that he regarded them as rich in significance and beauty. But, alas, upon almost everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me. I had no doubt that it would differ entirely from my own, since his came down from an unknown sphere towards which I was striving to raise myself; convinced that my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected spirit, I had so completely obliterated them all that, if I happened to find in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own mind, my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity had, in his infinite bounty, restored it to me, had pronounced it to be beautiful and right. It happened now and then that a page of Bergotte would express precisely those ideas which I used often at night, when I was unable to sleep, to write to my grandmother and mother, and so concisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of mottoes for me to set at the head of my letters. And so too, in later years, when I began to compose a book of my own, and the quality of some of my sentences seemed so inadequate that I could not make up my mind to go on with the undertaking, I would find the equivalent of my sentences in Bergotte's. But it was only then, when I read them in his pages, that I could enjoy them; when it was I myself who composed them, in my anxiety that they should exactly reproduce what I seemed to have detected in my mind, and in my fear of their not turning out 'true to life,' I had no time to ask myself whether what I was writing would be pleasant to read! But indeed there was no kind of language, no kind of ideas which I really liked, except these. My feverish and unsatisfactory attempts were themselves a token of my love, a love which brought me no pleasure, but was, for all that, intense and deep. And so, when I came suddenly upon similar phrases in the writings of another, that is to say stripped of their familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and self-tormentings, I was free to indulge to the full my own appetite for such things, just as a cook who, once in a while, has no dinner to prepare for other people, can then find time to gormandise himself. And so, when I had found, one day, in a book by Bergotte, some joke about an old family servant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a great deal of irony, but which was in principle what I had often said to my grandmother about Fran\u00e7oise, and when, another time, I had discovered that he thought not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of absolute Truth which were his writings, a remark similar to one which I had had occasion to make on our friend M. Legrandin (and, moreover, my remarks on Fran\u00e7oise and M. Legrandin were among those which I would most resolutely have sacrificed for Bergotte's sake, in the belief that he would find them quite without interest); then it was suddenly revealed to me that my own humble existence and the Realms of Truth were less widely separated than I had supposed, that at certain points they were actually in contact; and in my new-found confidence and joy I wept upon his printed page, as in the arms of a long-lost father.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and disappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found any consolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in my brain, with rather more dolce, rather more lento than he himself had, perhaps, intended, and his simplest phrase would strike my ears with something peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation. More than anything else in the world I cherished his philosophy, and had pledged myself to it in lifelong devotion. It made me impatient to reach the age when I should be eligible to attend the class at school called 'Philosophy.' I did not wish to learn or do anything else there, but simply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of Bergotte, and, if I had been told then that the metaphysicians whom I was actually to follow there resembled him in nothing, I should have been struck down by the despair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity, when a friend speaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to come.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One Sunday, while I was reading in the garden, I was interrupted by Swann, who had come to call upon my parents.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What are you reading? May I look? Why, it's Bergotte! Who has been telling you about him?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I replied that Bloch was responsible.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, yes, that boy I saw here once, who looks so like the Bellini portrait of Mahomet II. It's an astonishing likeness; he has the same arched eyebrows and hooked nose and prominent cheekbones. When his beard comes he'll be Mahomet himself. Anyhow he has good taste, for Bergotte is a charming creature.\" And seeing how much I seemed to admire Bergotte, Swann, who never spoke at all about the people he knew, made an exception in my favour and said: \"I know him well; if you would like him to write a few words on the title-page of your book I could ask him for you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I dared not accept such an offer, but bombarded Swann with questions about his friend. \"Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Actor? No, I can't say. But I do know this: there's not a man on the stage whom he thinks equal to Berma; he puts her above everyone. Have you seen her?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, sir, my parents do not allow me to go to the theatre.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That is a pity. You should insist. Berma in Ph\u00e8dre, in the Cid; well, she's only an actress, if you like, but you know that I don't believe very much in the 'hierarchy' of the arts.\" As he spoke I noticed, what had often struck me before in his conversations with my grandmother's sisters, that whenever he spoke of serious matters, whenever he used an expression which seemed to imply a definite opinion upon some important subject, he would take care to isolate, to sterilise it by using a special intonation, mechanical and ironic, as though he had put the phrase or word between inverted commas, and was anxious to disclaim any personal responsibility for it; as who should say \"the 'hierarchy,' don't you know, as silly people call it.\" But then, if it was so absurd, why did he say the 'hierarchy'? A moment later he went on: \"Her acting will give you as noble an inspiration as any masterpiece of art in the world, as\u2014oh, I don't know\u2014\" and he began to laugh, \"shall we say the Queens of Chartres?\" Until then I had supposed that his horror of having to give a serious opinion was something Parisian and refined, in contrast to the provincial dogmatism of my grandmother's sisters; and I had imagined also that it was characteristic of the mental attitude towards life of the circle in which Swann moved, where, by a natural reaction from the 'lyrical' enthusiasms of earlier generations, an excessive importance was given to small and precise facts, formerly regarded as vulgar, and anything in the nature of 'phrase-making' was banned. But now I found myself slightly shocked by this attitude which Swann invariably adopted when face to face with generalities. He appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion, and to be at his ease only when he could furnish, with meticulous accuracy, some precise but unimportant detail. But in so doing he did not take into account that even here he was giving an opinion, holding a brief (as they say) for something, that the accuracy of his details had an importance of its own. I thought again of the dinner that night, when I had been so unhappy because Mamma would not be coming up to my room, and when he had dismissed the balls given by the Princesse de L\u00e9on as being of no importance. And yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he was devoting his life. For what other kind of existence did he reserve the duties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things, of formulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas; and when would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at the same, time he made out that they were absurd? I noticed, too, in the manner in which Swann spoke to me of Bergotte, something which, to do him justice, was not peculiar to himself, but was shared by all that writer's admirers at that time, at least by my mother's friend and by Dr. du Boulbon. Like Swann, they would say of Bergotte: \"He has a charming mind, so individual, he has a way of his own of saying things, which is a little far-fetched, but so pleasant. You never need to look for his name on the title-page, you can tell his work at once.\" But none of them had yet gone so far as to say \"He is a great writer, he has great talent.\" They did not even credit him with talent at all. They did not speak, because they were not aware of it. We are very slow in recognising in the peculiar physiognomy of a new writer the type which is labelled 'great talent' in our museum of general ideas. Simply because that physiognomy is new and strange, we can find in it no resemblance to what we are accustomed to call talent. We say rather originality, charm, delicacy, strength; and then one day we add up the sum of these, and find that it amounts simply to talent.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Are there any books in which Bergotte has written about Berma?\" I asked M. Swann.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think he has, in that little essay on Racine, but it must be out of print. Still, there has perhaps been a second impression. I will find out. Anyhow, I can ask Bergotte himself all that you want to know next time he comes to dine with us. He never misses a week, from one year's end to another. He is my daughter's greatest friend. They go about together, and look at old towns and cathedrals and castles.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I was still completely ignorant of the different grades in the social hierarchy, the fact that my father found it impossible for us to see anything of Swann's wife and daughter had, for a long time, had the contrary effect of making me imagine them as separated from us by an enormous gulf, which greatly enhanced their dignity and importance in my eyes. I was sorry that my mother did not dye her hair and redden her lips, as I had heard our neighbour, Mme. Sazerat, say that Mme. Swann did, to gratify not her husband but M. de Charlus; and I felt that, to her, we must be an object of scorn, which distressed me particularly on account of the daughter, such a pretty little girl, as I had heard, and one of whom I used often to dream, always imagining her with the same features and appearance, which I bestowed upon her quite arbitrarily, but with a charming effect. But from this afternoon, when I had learned that Mile. Swann was a creature living in such rare and fortunate circumstances, bathed, as in her natural element, in such a sea of privilege that, if she should ask her parents whether anyone were coming to dinner, she would be answered in those two syllables, radiant with celestial light, would hear the name of that golden guest who was to her no more than an old friend of her family, Bergotte; that for her the intimate conversation at table, corresponding to what my great-aunt's conversation was for me, would be the words of Bergotte upon all those subjects which he had not been able to take up in his writings, and on which I would fain have heard him utter oracles; and that, above all, when she went to visit other towns, he would be walking by her side, unrecognised and glorious, like the gods who came down, of old, from heaven to dwell among mortal men: then I realised both the rare worth of a creature such as Mile. Swann, and, at the same time, how coarse and ignorant I should appear to her; and I felt so keenly how pleasant and yet how impossible it would be for me to become her friend that I was filled at once with longing and with despair. And usually, from this time forth, when I thought of her, I would see her standing before the porch of a cathedral, explaining to me what each of the statues meant, and, with a smile which was my highest commendation, presenting me, as her friend, to Bergotte. And invariably the charm of all the fancies which the thought of cathedrals used to inspire in me, the charm of the hills and valleys of the He de France and of the plains of Normandy, would radiate brightness and beauty over the picture I had formed in my mind of Mile. Swann; nothing more remained but to know and to love her. Once we believe that a fellow-creature has a share in some unknown existence to which that creature's love for ourselves can win us admission, that is, of all the preliminary conditions which Love exacts, the one to which he attaches most importance, the one which makes him generous or indifferent as to the rest. Even those women who pretend that they judge a man by his exterior only, see in that exterior an emanation from some special way of life. And that is why they fall in love with a soldier or a fireman, whose uniform makes them less particular about his face; they kiss and believe that beneath the crushing breastplate there beats a heart different from the rest, more gallant, more adventurous, more tender; and so it is that a young king or a crown prince may travel in foreign countries and make the most gratifying conquests, and yet lack entirely that regular and classic profile which would be indispensable, I dare say, in an outside-broker.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I was reading in the garden, a thing my great-aunt would never have understood my doing save on a Sunday, that being the day on which it was unlawful to indulge in any serious occupation, and on which she herself would lay aside her sewing (on a week-day she would have said, \"How you can go on amusing yourself with a book; it isn't Sunday, you know!\" putting into the word 'amusing' an implication of childishness and waste of time), my aunt L\u00e9onie would be gossiping with Fran\u00e7oise until it was time for Eulalie to arrive. She would tell her that she had just seen Mme. Goupil go by \"without an umbrella, in the silk dress she had made for her the other day at Ch\u00e2teaudun. If she has far to go before vespers, she may get it properly soaked.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Very likely\" (which meant also \"very likely not\") was the answer, for Fran\u00e7oise did not wish definitely to exclude the possibility of a happier alternative\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There, now,\" went on my aunt, beating her brow, \"that reminds me that I never heard if she got to church this morning before the Elevation. I must remember to ask Eulalie... Fran\u00e7oise, just look at that black cloud behind the steeple, and how poor the light is on the slates, you may be certain it will rain before the day is out. It couldn't possibly keep on like this, it's been too hot. And the sooner the better, for until the storm breaks my Vichy water won't 'go down,'\" she concluded, since, in her mind, the desire to accelerate the digestion of her Vichy water was of infinitely greater importance than her fear of seeing Mme. Goupil's new dress ruined.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Very likely.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And you know that when it rains in the Square there's none too much shelter.\" Suddenly my aunt turned pale. \"What, three o'clock!\" she exclaimed. \"But vespers will have begun already, and I've forgotten my pepsin! Now I know why that Vichy water has been lying on my stomach.\" And falling precipitately upon a prayer-book bound in purple velvet, with gilt clasps, out of which in her haste she let fall a shower of the little pictures, each in a lace fringe of yellowish paper, which she used to mark the places of the greater feasts of the church, my aunt, while she swallowed her drops, began at full speed to mutter the words of the sacred text, its meaning being slightly clouded in her brain by the uncertainty whether the pepsin, when taken so long after the Vichy, would still be able to overtake it and to 'send it down.' \"Three o'clock! It's unbelievable how time flies.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A little tap at the window, as though some missile had struck it, followed by a plentiful, falling sound, as light, though, as if a shower of sand were being sprinkled from a window overhead; then the fall spread, took on an order, a rhythm, became liquid, loud, drumming, musical, innumerable, universal. It was the rain.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There, Fran\u00e7oise, what did I tell you? How it's coming down! But I think I heard the bell at the garden gate: go along and see who can be outside in this weather.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise went and returned. \"It's Mme. Am\u00e9d\u00e9e\" (my grandmother). \"She said she was going for a walk. It's raining hard, all the same.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm not at all surprised,\" said my aunt, looking up towards the sky. \"I've always said that she was not in the least like other people. Well, I'm glad it's she and not myself who's outside in all this.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Mme. Am\u00e9d\u00e9e is always the exact opposite of the rest,\" said Fran\u00e7oise, not unkindly, refraining until she should be alone with the other servants from stating her belief that my grandmother was 'a bit off her head.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There's Benediction over! Eulalie will never come now,\" sighed my aunt. \"It will be the weather that's frightened her away.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But it's not five o'clock yet, Mme. Octave, it's only half-past four.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Only half-past four! And here am I, obliged to draw back the small curtains, just to get a tiny streak of daylight. At half-past four! Only a week before the Rogation-days. Ah, my poor Fran\u00e7oise, the dear Lord must be sorely vexed with us. The world is going too far in these days. As my poor Octave used to say, we have forgotten God too often, and He is taking vengeance upon us.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A bright flush animated my aunt's cheeks; it was Eulalie. As ill luck would have it, scarcely had she been admitted to the presence when Fran\u00e7oise reappeared and, with a smile which was meant to indicate her full participation in the pleasure which, she had no doubt, her tidings would give my aunt, articulating each syllable so as to shew that, in spite of her having to translate them into indirect speech, she was repeating, as a good servant should, the very words which the new visitor had condescended to use, said: \"His reverence the Cur\u00e9 would be delighted, enchanted, if Mme. Octave is not resting just now, and could see him. His reverence does not wish to disturb Mme. Octave. His reverence is downstairs; I told him to go into the parlour.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had the truth been known, the Cur\u00e9's visits gave my aunt no such ecstatic pleasure as Fran\u00e7oise supposed, and the air of jubilation with which she felt bound to illuminate her face whenever she had to announce his arrival, did not altogether correspond to what was felt by her invalid. The Cur\u00e9 (an excellent man, with whom I am sorry now that I did not converse more often, for, even if he cared nothing for the arts, he knew a great many etymologies), being in the habit of shewing distinguished visitors over his church (he had even planned to compile a history of the Parish of Com-bray), used to weary her with his endless explanations, which, incidentally, never varied in the least degree. But when his visit synchronized exactly with Eulalie's it became frankly distasteful to my aunt. She would have preferred to make the most of Eulalie, and not to have had the whole of her circle about her at one time. But she dared not send the Cur\u00e9 away, and had to content herself with making a sign to Eulalie not to leave when he did, so that she might have her to herself for a little after he had gone.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What is this I have been hearing, Father, that a painter has set up his easel in your church, and is copying one of the windows? Old as I am, I can safely say that I have never even heard of such a thing in all my life! What is the world coming to next, I wonder! And the ugliest thing in the whole church, too.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I will not go so far as to say that it is quite the ugliest, for, although there are certain things in Saint-Hilaire which are well worth a visit, there are others that are very old now, in my poor basilica, the only one in all the diocese that has never even been restored. The Lord knows, our porch is dirty and out of date; still, it is of a majestic character; take, for instance, the Esther tapestries, though personally I would not give a brass farthing for the pair of them, but experts put them next after the ones at Sens. I can quite see, too, that apart from certain details which are\u2014well, a trifle realistic, they shew features which testify to a genuine power of observation. But don't talk to me about the windows. Is it common sense, I ask you, to leave up windows which shut out all the daylight, and even confuse the eyes by throwing patches of colour, to which I should be hard put to it to give a name, on a floor in which there are not two slabs on the same level? And yet they refuse to renew the floor for me because, if you please, those are the tombstones of the Abbots of Combray and the Lords of Guermantes, the old Counts, you know, of Brabant, direct ancestors of the present Duc de Guermantes, and of his Duchesse also, since she was a lady of the Guermantes family, and married her cousin.\" (My grandmother, whose steady refusal to take any interest in 'persons' had ended in her confusing all their names and titles, whenever anyone mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes used to make out that she must be related to Mme. de Villeparisis. The whole family would then burst out laughing; and she would attempt to justify herself by harking back to some invitation to a christening or funeral: \"I feel sure that there was a Guermantes in it somewhere.\" And for once I would side with the others, and against her, refusing to admit that there could be any connection between her school-friend and the descendant of Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Look at Roussainville,\" the Cur\u00e9 went on. \"It is nothing more nowadays than a parish of farmers, though in olden times the place must have had a considerable importance from its trade in felt hats and clocks. (I am not certain, by the way, of the etymology of Roussainville. I should dearly like to think that the name was originally Rouville, from Radulfi villa, analogous, don't you see, to Ch\u00e2teauroux,Castrum Radulfi, but we will talk about that some other time.) Very well; the church there has superb windows, almost all quite modern, including that most imposing 'Entry of Louis-Philippe into Combray' which would be more in keeping, surely, at Combray itself, and which is every bit as good, I understand, as the famous^windows at Chartres. Only yesterday I met Dr. Percepied's brother, who goes in for these things, and he told me that he looked upon it as a most beautiful piece of work. But, as I said to this artist, who, by the way, seems to be a most civil fellow, and is a regular virtuoso, it appears, with his brush; what on earth, I said to him, do you find so extraordinary in this window, which is, if anything, a little dingier than the rest?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am sure that if you were to ask his Lordship,\" said my aunt in a resigned tone, for she had begun to feel that she was going to be 'tired,' \"he would never refuse you a new window.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You may depend upon it, Mme. Octave,\" replied the Cur\u00e9. \"Why, it was just his Lordship himself who started the outcry about the window, by proving that it represented Gilbert the Bad, a Lord of Guermantes and a direct descendant of Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant, who was a daughter of the House of Guermantes, receiving absolution from Saint Hilaire.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I don't see where Saint Hilaire comes in.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why yes, have you never noticed, in the corner of the window, a lady in a yellow robe? Very well, that is Saint Hilaire, who is also known, you will remember, in certain parts of the country as Saint Illiers, Saint H\u00e8lier, and even, in the Jura, Saint Ylie. But these various corruptions of Sanctus Hilarius are by no means the most curious that have occurred in the names of the blessed Saints. Take, for example, my good Eulalie, the case of your own patron, Sancta Eulalia; do you know what she has become in Burgundy? Saint Eloi, nothing more nor less! The lady has become a gentleman. Do you hear that, Eulalie, after you are dead they will make a man of you!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Father will always have his joke.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Gilbert's brother, Charles the Stammerer, was a pious prince, but, having early in life lost his father, Pepin the Mad, who died as a result of his mental infirmity, he wielded the supreme power with all the arrogance of a man who has not been subjected to discipline in his youth, so much so that, whenever he saw a man in a town whose face he did not remember, he would massacre the whole place, to the last inhabitant. Gilbert, wishing to be avenged on Charles, caused the church at Combray to be burned down, the original church, that was, which Th\u00e9odebert, when he and his court left the country residence he had near here, at Thiberzy (which is, of course, Theodeberiacus), to go out and fight the Burgundians, had promised to build over the tomb of Saint Hilaire if the Saint brought him; victory. Nothing remains of it now but the crypt, into which Th\u00e9odore has probably taken you, for Gilbert burned all the rest. Finally, he defeated the unlucky Charles with the aid of William\" which the Cur\u00e9 pronounced \"Will'am\" \"the Conqueror, which is why so many English still come to visit the place. But he does not appear to have managed to win the affection of the people of Combray, for they fell upon him as he was coming out from mass, and cut off his head. Th\u00e9odore has a little book, that he lends people, which tells you the whole story.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But what is unquestionably the most remarkable thing about our church is the view from the belfry, which is full of grandeur. Certainly in your case, since you are not very strong, I should never recommend you: to climb our seven and ninety steps, just half the number they have in the famous cathedral at Milan. It is quite tiring enough for the most active person, especially as you have to go on your hands and knees, if you don't wish to crack your skull, and you collect all the cobwebs off the staircase upon your clothes. In any case you should be well wrapped up,\" he went on, without noticing my aunt's fury at the mere suggestion that she could ever, possibly, be capable of climbing into his belfry, \"for there's a strong breeze there, once you get to the top. Some people even assure me that they have felt the chill of death up there. No matter, on Sundays there are always clubs and societies, who come, some of them, long distances to admire our beautiful panorama, and they always go home charmed. Wait now, next Sunday, if the weather holds, you will be sure to find a lot of people there, for Rogation-tide. You must admit, certainly, that the view from up there is like a fairy-tale, with what you might call vistas along the plain, which have quite a special charm of their own. On a clear day you can see as far as Verneuil. And then another thing; you can see at the same time places which you are in the habit of seeing one without the other, as, for instance, the course of the Vivonne and the ditches at Saint-Assise-l\u00e8s-Combray, which are separated, really, by a screen of tall trees; or, to take another example, there are all the canals at Jouy-le-Vicomte, which is Gaudiacus vicecomitis, as of course you know. Each time that I have been to Jouy I have seen a bit of a canal in one place, and then I have turned a corner and seen another, but when I saw the second I could no longer see the first. I tried in vain to imagine how they lay by one another; it was no good. But, from the top of Saint-Hilaire, it's quite another matter; the whole countryside is spread out before you like a map. Only, you cannot make out the water; you would say that there were great rifts in the town, slicing it up so neatly that it looks like a loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been cut up. To get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at once; up here on the top of Saint-Hilaire and down there at Jouy-le-Vicomte.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Cur\u00e9 had so much exhausted my aunt that no sooner had he gone than she was obliged to send away Eulalie also\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Here, my poor Eulalie,\" she said in a feeble voice, drawing a coin from a small purse which lay ready to her hand. \"This is just something so that you shall not forget me in your prayers.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but, Mme. Octave, I don't think I ought to; you know very well that I don't come here for that!\" So Eulalie would answer, with the same hesitation and the same embarrassment, every Sunday, as though each temptation were the first, and with a look of displeasure which enlivened my aunt and never offended her, for if it so happened that Eulalie, when she took the money, looked a little less sulky than usual, my aunt would remark afterwards, \"I cannot think what has come over Eulalie; I gave her just the trifle I always give, and she did not look at all pleased.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't think she has very much to complain of, all the same,\" Fran\u00e7oise would sigh grimly, for she had a tendency to regard as petty cash all that my aunt might give her for herself or her children, and as treasure riotously squandered on a pampered and ungrateful darling the little coins slipped, Sunday by Sunday, into Eulalie's hand, but so discreetly passed that Fran\u00e7oise never managed to see them. It was not that she wanted to have for herself the money my aunt bestowed on Eulalie. She already enjoyed a sufficiency of all that my aunt possessed, in the knowledge that the wealth of the mistress automatically ennobled and glorified the maid in the eyes of the world; and that she herself was conspicuous and worthy to be praised throughout Combray, Jouy-le-Vicomte, and other cities of men, on account of my aunt's many farms, her frequent and prolonged visits from the Cur\u00e9, and the astonishing number of bottles of Vichy water which she consumed. Fran\u00e7oise was avaricious only for my aunt; had she had control over my aunt's fortune (which would have more than satisfied her highest ambition) she would have guarded it from the assaults of strangers with a maternal ferocity. She would, however, have seen no great harm in what my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to give away, had she given only to those who were already rich. Perhaps she felt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt's presents, could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on that account. Besides, presents offered to persons of great wealth and position, such as Mme. Sazerat, M. Swann, M. Legrandin and Mme. Goupil, to persons of the 'same class' as my aunt, and who would naturally 'mix with her,' seemed to Fran\u00e7oise to be included among the ornamental customs of that strange and brilliant life led by rich people, who hunted and shot, gave balls and paid visits, a life which she would contemplate with an admiring smile. But it was by no means the same thing if, for this princely exchange of courtesies, my aunt substituted mere charity, if her beneficiaries were of the class which Fran\u00e7oise would label \"people like myself,\" or \"people no better than myself,\" people whom she despised even more if they did not address her always as \"Mme. Fran\u00e7oise,\" just to shew that they considered themselves to be 'not as good.' And when she saw that, despite all her warnings, my aunt continued to do exactly as she pleased, and to fling money away with both hands (or so, at least, Fran\u00e7oise believed) on undeserving objects, she began to find that the presents she herself received from my aunt were very tiny compared to the imaginary riches squandered upon Eulalie, There was not, in the neighbourhood of Combray, a farm of such prosperity and importance that Fran\u00e7oise doubted Eulalie's ability to buy it, without thinking twice, out of the capital which her visits to my aunt had 'brought in.' It must be added that Eulalie had formed an exactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of Fran\u00e7oise. So, every Sunday, after Eulalie had gone, Fran\u00e7oise would mercilessly prophesy her coming downfall. She hated Eulalie, but was at the same time afraid of her, and so felt bound, when Eulalie was there, to 'look pleasant.' But she would make up for that after the other's departure; never, it is true, alluding to her by name, but hinting at her in Sibylline oracles, or in utterances of a comprehensive character, like those of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher, but so worded that their special application could not escape my aunt. After peering out at the side of the curtain to see whether Eulalie had shut the front-door behind her; \"Flatterers know how to make themselves welcome, and to gather up the crumbs; but have patience, have patience; our God is a jealous God, and one fine day He will be avenged upon them!\" she would declaim, with the sidelong, insinuating glance of Joash, thinking of Athaliah alone when he says that the\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    prosperity\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of wicked men runs like a torrent past\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And soon is spent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But on this memorable afternoon, when the Cur\u00e9 had come as well, and by his interminable visit had drained my aunt's strength, Fran\u00e7oise followed Eulalie from the room, saying: \"Mme. Octave, I will leave you to rest; you look utterly tired out.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And my aunt answered her not a word, breathing a sigh so faint that it seemed it must prove her last, and lying there with closed eyes, as though already dead. But hardly had Fran\u00e7oise arrived downstairs, when four peals of a bell, pulled with the utmost violence, reverberated through the house, and my aunt, sitting erect upon her bed, called out: \"Has Eulalie gone yet? Would you believe it; I forgot to ask her whether Mme. Goupil arrived in church before the Elevation. Run after her, quick!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Fran\u00e7oise returned alone, having failed to overtake Eulalie. \"It is most provoking,\" said my aunt, shaking her head. \"The one important thing that I had to ask her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this way life went by for my aunt L\u00e9onie, always the same, in the gentle uniformity of what she called, with a pretence of deprecation but with a deep tenderness, her 'little jog-trot.' Respected by all and sundry, not merely in her own house, where every one of us, having learned the futility of recommending any healthier mode of life, had become gradually resigned to its observance, but in the village as well, where, three streets away, a tradesman who had to hammer nails into a packing-case would send first to Fran\u00e7oise to make sure that my aunt was not 'resting'\u2014her 'little jog-trot' was, none the less, brutally disturbed on one occasion in this same year. Like a fruit hidden among its leaves, which has grown and ripened unobserved by man, until it falls of its own accord, there came upon us one night the kitchen-maid's confinement. Her pains were unbearable, and, as there was no midwife in Combray, Fran\u00e7oise had to set off before dawn to fetch one from Thiberzy. My aunt was unable to 'rest,' owing to the cries of the girl, and as Fran\u00e7oise, though the distance was nothing, was very late in returning, her services were greatly missed. And so, in the course of the morning, my mother said to me: \"Run upstairs, and see if your aunt wants anything.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went into the first of her two rooms, and through the open door of the other saw my aunt lying on her side, asleep. I could hear her breathing, in what was almost distinguishable as a snore. I was just going to slip away when something, probably the sound of my entry, interrupted her sleep, and made it 'change speed,' as they say of motorcars nowadays, for the music of her snore broke off for a second and began again on a lower note; then she awoke, and half turned her face, which I could see for the first time; a kind of horror was imprinted on it; plainly she had just escaped from some terrifying dream. She could not see me from where she was lying, and I stood there not knowing whether I ought to go forward or to retire; but all at once she seemed to return to a sense of reality, and to grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified her; a smile of joy, a pious act of thanksgiving to God, Who is pleased to grant that life shall be less cruel than our dreams, feebly illumined her face, and, with the habit she had formed of speaking to herself, half-aloud, when she thought herself alone, she murmured: \"The Lord be praised! We have nothing to disturb us here but the kitchen-maid's baby. And I've been dreaming that my poor Octave had come back to life, and was trying to make me take a walk every day!\" She stretched out a hand towards her rosary, which was lying on the small table, but sleep was once again getting the mastery, and did not leave her the strength to reach it; she fell asleep, calm and contented, and I crept out of the room on tiptoe, without either her or anyone's else ever knowing, from that day to this, what I had seen and heard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I say that, apart from such rare happenings as this confinement, my aunt's 'little jog-trot' never underwent any variation, I do not include those variations which, repeated at regular intervals and in identical form, did no more, really, than print a sort of uniform pattern upon the greater uniformity of her life. So, for instance, every Saturday, as Fran\u00e7oise had to go in the afternoon to market at Roussainville-le-Pin, the whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier. And my aunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly exception to her general habits, that she clung to it as much as to the rest. She was so well 'routined' to it, as Fran\u00e7oise would say, that if, on a Saturday, she had had to wait for her luncheon until the regular hour, it would have 'upset' her as much as if she had had, on an ordinary day, to put her luncheon forward to its Saturday time. Incidentally this acceleration of luncheon gave Saturday, for all of us, an individual character, kindly and rather attractive. At the moment when, ordinarily, there was still an hour to be lived through before meal-time sounded, we would all know that in a few seconds we should see the endives make their precocious appearance, followed by the special favour of an omelette, an unmerited steak. The return of this asymmetrical Saturday was one of those petty occurrences, intra-mural, localised, almost civic, which, in uneventful lives and stable orders of society, create a kind of national unity, and become the favourite theme for conversation, for pleasantries, for anecdotes which can be embroidered as the narrator pleases; it would have provided a nucleus, ready-made, for a legendary cycle, if any of us had had the epic mind. At daybreak, before we were dressed, without rhyme or reason, save for the pleasure of proving the strength of our solidarity, we would call to one another good-humoredly, cordially, patriotically, \"Hurry up; there's no time to be lost; don't forget, it's Saturday!\" while my aunt, gossiping with Fran\u00e7oise, and reflecting that the day would be even longer than usual, would say, \"You might cook them a nice bit of veal, seeing that it's Saturday.\" If, at half-past ten, some one absent-mindedly pulled out a watch and said, \"I say, an hour-and-a-half still before luncheon,\" everyone else would be in ecstasies over being able to retort at once: \"Why, what are you thinking about? Have you for-gotten that it's Saturday?\" And a quarter of an hour later we would still be laughing, and reminding ourselves to go up and tell aunt L\u00e9onie about this absurd mistake, to amuse her. The very face of the sky appeared to undergo a change. After luncheon the sun, conscious that it was Saturday, would blaze an hour longer in the zenith, and when some one, thinking that we were late in starting for our walk, said, \"What, only two o'clock!\" feeling the heavy throb go by him of the twin strokes from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire (which as a rule passed no one at that hour upon the highways, deserted for the midday meal or for the nap which follows it, or on the banks of the bright and ever-flowing stream, which even the angler had abandoned, and so slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky, where only a few loitering clouds remained to greet them) the whole family would respond in chorus: \"Why, you're forgetting; we had luncheon an hour earlier; you know very well it's Saturday.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The surprise of a 'barbarian' (for so we termed everyone who was not acquainted with Saturday's special customs) who had called at eleven o'clock to speak to my father, and had found us at table, was an event which used to cause Fran\u00e7oise as much merriment as, perhaps, anything that had ever happened in her life. And if she found it amusing that the nonplussed visitor should not have known, beforehand, that we had our luncheon an hour earlier on Saturday, it was still more irresistibly funny that my father himself (fully as she sympathised, from the bottom of her heart, with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him) should never have dreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a matter, and so had replied, with no further enlightenment of the other's surprise at seeing us already in the dining-room: \"You see, it's Saturday.\" On reaching this point in the story, Fran\u00e7oise would pause to wipe the tears of merriment from her eyes, and then, to add to her own enjoyment, would prolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom the word 'Saturday' had conveyed nothing. And so far from our objecting to these interpolations, we would feel that the story was not yet long enough, and would rally her with: \"Oh, but surely he said something else as well. There was more than that, the first time you told it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My great-aunt herself would lay aside her work, and raise her head and look on at us over her glasses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The day had yet another characteristic feature, namely, that during May we used to go out on Saturday evenings after dinner to the 'Month of Mary' devotions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we were liable, there, to meet M. Vinteuil, who held very strict views on \"the deplorable untidiness of young people, which seems to be encouraged in these days,\" my mother would first see that there was nothing out of order in my appearance, and then we would set out for the church. It was in these 'Month of Mary' services that I can remember having first fallen in love with hawthorn-blossom. The hawthorn was not merely in the church, for there, holy ground as it was, we had all of us a right of entry; but, arranged upon the altar itself, inseparable from the mysteries in whose celebration it was playing a part, it thrust in among the tapers and the sacred vessels its rows of branches, tied to one another horizontally in a stiff, festal scheme of decoration; and they were made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark leaves, over which were scattered in profusion, as over a bridal train, little clusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness. Though I dared not look at them save through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme was composed of living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by trimming the shape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public rejoicing and a solemn mystery. Higher up on the altar, a flower had opened here and there with a careless grace, holding so unconcernedly, like a final, almost vaporous bedizening, its bunch of stamens, slender as gossamer, which clouded the flower itself in a white mist, that in following these with my eyes, in trying to imitate, somewhere inside myself, the action of their blossoming, I imagined it as a swift and thoughtless movement of the head with an enticing glance from her contracted pupils, by a young girl in white, careless and alive\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Vinteuil had come in with his daughter and had sat down beside us. He belonged to a good family, and had once been music-master to my grandmother's sisters; so that when, after losing his wife and inheriting some property, he had retired to the neighbourhood of Combray, we used often to invite him to our house. But with his intense prudishness he had given up coming, so as not to be obliged to meet Swann, who had made what he called \"a most unsuitable marriage, as seems to be the fashion in these days.\" My mother, on hearing that he 'composed,' told him by way of a compliment that, when she came to see him, he must play her something of his own. M. Vinteuil would have liked nothing better, but he carried politeness and consideration for others to so fine a point, always putting himself in their place, that he was afraid of boring them, or of appearing egotistical, if he carried out, or even allowed them to suspect what were his own desires. On the day when my parents had gone to pay him a visit, I had accompanied them, but they had allowed me to remain outside, and as M. Vinteuil's house, Montjouvain, stood on a site actually hollowed out from a steep hill covered with shrubs, among which I took cover, I had found myself on a level with his drawing-room, upstairs, and only a few feet away from its window. When a servant came in to tell him that my parents had arrived, I had seen M. Vinteuil run to the piano and lay out a sheet of music so as to catch the eye. But as soon as they entered the room he had snatched it away and hidden it in a corner. He was afraid, no doubt, of letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave him a chance of playing them some of his compositions. And every time that my mother, in the course of her visit, had returned to the subject of his playing, he had hurriedly protested: \"I cannot think who put that on the piano; it is not the proper place for it at all,\" and had turned the conversation aside to other topics, simply because those were of less interest to himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His one and only passion was for his daughter, and she, with her somewhat boyish appearance, looked so robust that it was hard to restrain a smile when one saw the precautions her father used to take for her health, with spare shawls always in readiness to wrap around her shoulders. My grandmother had drawn our attention to the gentle, delicate, almost timid expression which might often be caught flitting across the face, dusted all over with freckles, of this otherwise stolid child. When she had spoken, she would at once take her own words in the sense in which her audience must have heard them, she would be alarmed at the possibility of a misunderstanding, and one would see, in clear outline, as though in a transparency, beneath the mannish face of the 'good sort' that she was, the finer features of a young woman in tears\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, before turning to leave the church, I made a genuflection before the altar, I felt suddenly, as I rose again, a bitter-sweet fragrance of almonds steal towards me from the hawthorn-blossom, and I then noticed that on the flowers themselves were little spots of a creamier colour, in which I imagined that this fragrance must lie concealed, as the taste of an almond cake lay in the burned parts, or the sweetness of Mile. Vinteuil's cheeks beneath their freckles. Despite the heavy, motionless silence of the hawthorns, these gusts of fragrance came to me like the murmuring of an intense vitality, with which the whole altar was quivering like a roadside hedge explored by living antennae, of which I was reminded by seeing some stamens, almost red in colour, which seemed to have kept the springtime virulence, the irritant power of stinging insects now transmuted into flowers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outside the church we would stand talking for a moment with M. Vinteuil, in the porch. Boys would be chevying one another in the Square, and he would interfere, taking the side of the little ones and lecturing the big. If his daughter said, in her thick, comfortable voice, how glad she had been to see us, immediately it would seem as though some elder and more sensitive sister, latent in her, had blushed at this thoughtless, schoolboyish utterance, which had, perhaps, made us think that she was angling for an invitation to the house. Her father would then arrange a cloak over her shoulders, they would clamber into a little dog-cart which she herself drove, and home they would both go to Montjouvain. As for ourselves, the next day being Sunday, with no need to be up and stirring before high mass, if it was a moonlight night and warm, then, instead of taking us home at once, my father, in his thirst for personal distinction, would lead us on a long walk round by the Calvary, which my mother's utter incapacity for taking her bearings, or even for knowing which road she might be on, made her regard as a triumph of his strategic genius. Sometimes we would go as far as the viaduct, which began to stride on its long legs of stone at the railway station, and to me typified all the wretchedness of exile beyond the last outposts of civilisation, because every year, as we came down from Paris, we would be warned to take special care, when we got to Combray, not to miss the station, to be ready before the train stopped, since it would start again in two minutes and proceed across the viaduct, out of the lands of Christendom, of which Combray, to me, represented the farthest limit. We would return by the Boulevard de la Gare, which contained the most attractive villas in the town. In each of their gardens the moonlight, copying the art of Hubert Robert, had scattered its broken staircases of white marble, its fountains of water and gates temptingly ajar. Its beams had swept away the telegraph office. All that was left of it was a column, half shattered, but preserving the beauty of a ruin which endures for all time. I would by now be dragging my weary limbs, and ready to drop with sleep; the balmy scent of the lime-trees seemed a consolation which I could obtain only at the price of great suffering and exhaustion, and not worthy of the effort. From gates far apart the watchdogs, awakened by our steps in the silence, would set up an antiphonal barking, as I still hear them bark, at times, in the evenings, and it is in their custody (when the public gardens of Combray were constructed on its site) that the Boulevard de la Gare must have taken refuge, for wherever I may be, as soon as they begin their alternate challenge and acceptance, I can see it again with all its lime-trees, and its pavement glistening beneath the moon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly my father would bring us to a standstill and ask my mother\u2014\"Where are we?\" Utterly worn out by the walk but still proud of her husband, she would lovingly confess that she had not the least idea. He would shrug his shoulders and laugh. And then, as though it had slipped, with his latchkey, from his waistcoat pocket, he would point out to us, when it stood before our eyes, the back-gate of our own garden, which had come hand-in-hand with the familiar corner of the Rue du Saint-Esprit, to await us, to greet us at the end of our wanderings over paths unknown. My mother would murmur admiringly \"You really are wonderful!\" And from that instant I had not to take another step; the ground moved forward under my feet in that garden where, for so long, my actions had ceased to require any control, or even attention, from my will. Custom came to take me in her arms, carried me all the way up to my bed, and laid me down there like a little child\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although Saturday, by beginning an hour earlier, and by depriving her of the services of Fran\u00e7oise, passed more slowly than other days for my aunt, yet, the moment it was past, and a new week begun, she would look forward with impatience to its return, as something that embodied all the novelty and distraction which her frail and disordered body was still able to endure. This was not to say, however, that she did not long, at times, for some even greater variation, that she did not pass through those abnormal hours in which one thirsts for something different from what one has, when those people who, through lack of energy or imagination, are unable to generate any motive power in themselves, cry out, as the clock strikes or the postman knocks, in their eagerness for news (even if it be bad news), for some emotion (even that of grief); when the heartstrings, which prosperity has silenced, like a harp laid by, yearn to be plucked and sounded again by some hand, even a brutal hand, even if it shall break them; when the will, which has with such difficulty brought itself to subdue its impulse, to renounce its right to abandon itself to its own uncontrolled desires, and consequent sufferings, would fain cast its guiding reins into the hands of circumstances, coercive and, it may be, cruel. Of course, since my aunt's strength, which was completely drained by the slightest exertion, returned but drop by drop into the pool of her repose, the reservoir was very slow in filling, and months would go by before she reached that surplus which other people use up in their daily activities, but which she had no idea\u2014and could never decide how to employ. And I have no doubt that then\u2014just as a desire to have her potatoes served with b\u00e9chamel sauce, for a change, would be formed, ultimately, from the pleasure she found in the daily reappearance of those mashed potatoes of which she was never 'tired'\u2014she would extract from the accumulation of those monotonous days (on which she so much depended) a keen expectation of some domestic cataclysm, instantaneous in its happening, but violent enough to compel her to put into effect, once for all, one of those changes which she knew would be beneficial to her health, but to which she could never make up her mind without some such stimulus. She was genuinely fond of us; she would have enjoyed the long luxury of weeping for our untimely decease; coming at a moment when she felt 'well' and was not in a perspiration, the news that the house was being destroyed by a fire, in which all the rest of us had already perished, a fire which, in a little while, would not leave one stone standing upon another, but from which she herself would still have plenty of time to escape without undue haste, provided that she rose at once from her bed, must often have haunted her dreams, as a prospect which combined with the two minor advantages of letting her taste the full savour of her affection for us in long years of mourning, and of causing universal stupefaction in the village when she should sally forth to conduct our obsequies, crushed but courageous, moribund but erect, the paramount and priceless boon of forcing her at the right moment, with no time to be lost, no room for weakening hesitations, to go off and spend the summer at her charming farm of Mirougrain, where there was a waterfall. Inasmuch as nothing of this sort had ever occurred, though indeed she must often have pondered the success of such a manoeuvre as she lay alone absorbed in her interminable games of patience (and though it must have plunged her in despair from the first moment of its realisation, from the first of those little unforeseen facts, the first word of calamitous news, whose accents can never afterwards be expunged from the memory, everything that bears upon it the imprint of actual, physical death, so terribly different from the logical abstraction of its possibility) she would fall back from time to time, to add an interest to her life, upon imagining other, minor catastrophes, which she would follow up with passion. She would beguile herself with a sudden suspicion that Fran\u00e7oise had been robbing her, that she had set a trap to make certain, and had caught her betrayer red-handed; and being in the habit, when she made up a game of cards by herself, of playing her own and her adversary's hands at once, she would first stammer out Fran\u00e7oise's awkward apologies, and then reply to them with such a fiery indignation that any of us who happened to intrude upon her at one of these moments would find her bathed in perspiration, her eyes blazing, her false hair pushed awry and exposing the baldness of her brows. Fran\u00e7oise must often, from the next room, have heard these mordant sarcasms levelled at herself, the mere framing of which in words would not have relieved my aunt's feelings sufficiently, had they been allowed to remain in a purely immaterial form, without the degree of substance and reality which she added to them by murmuring them half-aloud. Sometimes, however, even these counterpane dramas would not satisfy my aunt; she must see her work staged. And so, on a Sunday, with all the doors mysteriously closed, she would confide in Eulalie her doubts of Fran\u00e7oise's integrity and her determination to be rid of her, and on another day she would confide in Fran\u00e7oise her suspicions of the disloyalty of Eulalie, to whom the front-door would very soon be closed for good. A few days more, and, disgusted with her latest confidant, she would again be 'as thick as thieves' with the traitor, while, before the next performance, the two would once more have changed their parts. But the suspicions which Eulalie might occasionally breed in her were no more than a fire of straw, which must soon subside for lack of fuel, since Eulalie was not living with her in the house. It was a very different matter when the suspect was Fran\u00e7oise, of whose presence under the same roof as herself my aunt was perpetually conscious, while for fear of catching cold, were she to leave her bed, she would never dare go downstairs to the kitchen to see for herself whether there was, indeed, any foundation for her suspicions. And so on by degrees, until her mind had no other occupation than to attempt, at every hour of the day, to discover what was being done, what was being concealed from her by Fran\u00e7oise. She would detect the most furtive movement of Fran\u00e7oise's features, something contradictory in what she was saying, some desire which she appeared to be screening. And she would shew her that she was unmasked, by, a single word, which made Fran\u00e7oise turn pale, and which my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in driving into her unhappy servant's heart. And the very next Sunday a disclosure by Eulalie\u2014like one of those discoveries which suddenly open up an unsuspected field for exploration to some new science which has hitherto followed only the beaten paths\u2014proved to my aunt that her own worst suspicions fell a long way short of the appalling truth. \"But Fran\u00e7oise ought to know that,\" said Eulalie, \"now that you have given her a carriage.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now that I have given her a carriage!\" gasped my aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but I didn't know; I only thought so; I saw her go by yesterday in her open coach, as proud as Artaban, on her way to Roussainville market. I supposed that it must be Mme. Octave who had given it to her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So on by degrees, until Fran\u00e7oise and my aunt, the quarry and the hunter, could never cease from trying to forestall each other's devices. My mother was afraid lest Fran\u00e7oise should develop a genuine hatred of my aunt, who was doing everything in her power to annoy her. However that might be, Fran\u00e7oise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely scrupulous attention to my aunt's least word and gesture. When she had to ask her for anything she would hesitate, first, for a long time, making up her mind how best to begin. And when she had uttered her request, she would watch my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the expression on her face what she thought of it, and how she would reply. And in this way\u2014whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth century, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great Louis, would consider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family, or when he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning Sovereigns of Europe, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere outward forms\u2014a middle-aged lady in a small country town, by doing no more than yield whole-hearted obedience to her own irresistible eccentricities, and to a spirit of mischief engendered by the utter idleness of her existence, could see, without ever having given a thought to Louis XIV, the most trivial occupations of her daily life, her morning toilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by virtue of their despotic singularity, something of the interest that was to be found in what Saint-Simon used to call the 'machinery' of life at Versailles; and was able, too, to persuade herself that her silence, a shade of good humour or of arrogance on her features, would provide Fran\u00e7oise with matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror, as did the silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King when a courtier, or even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition to him, at the turning of an avenue, at Versailles\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One Sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the Cur\u00e9 and from Eulalie, and had been left alone, afterwards, to rest, the whole family went upstairs to bid her good night, and Mamma ventured to condole with her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both visitors to her door at the same time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I hear that things went wrong again to-day, L\u00e9onie,\" she said kindly, \"you have had all your friends here at once.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And my great-aunt interrupted with: \"Too many good things...\" for, since her daughter's illness, she felt herself in duty bound to revive her as far as possible by always drawing her attention to the brighter side of things. But my father had begun to speak\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I should like to take advantage,\" he said, \"of the whole family's being here together, to tell you a story, so as not to have to begin all over again to each of you separately. I am afraid we are in M. Legrandin's bad books; he would hardly say 'How d'ye do' to me this morning.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not wait to hear the end of my father's story, for I had been with him myself after mass when we had passed M. Legrandin; instead, I went downstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner, which was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and excited me as might the programme of a coming festivity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As M. Legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church, walking by the side of a lady, the owner of a country house in the neighbourhood, whom we knew only by sight, my father had saluted him in a manner at once friendly and reserved, without stopping in his walk; M. Legrandin had barely acknowledged the courtesy, and then with an air of surprise, as though he had not recognised us, and with that distant look characteristic of people who do not wish to be agreeable, and who from the suddenly receding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of you at the far end of an interminably straight road, and at so great a distance that they content themselves with directing towards you an almost imperceptible movement of the head, in proportion to your doll-like dimensions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, the lady who was walking with Legrandin was a model of virtue, known and highly respected; there could be no question of his being out for amorous adventure, and annoyed at being detected; and my father asked himself how he could possibly have displeased our friend\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us,\" he said, \"because among all those people in their Sunday clothes there is something about him, with his little cut-away coat and his soft neckties, so little 'dressed-up,' so genuinely simple; an air of innocence, almost, which is really attractive.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the vote of the family council was unanimous, that my father had imagined the whole thing, or that Legrandin, at the moment in question, had been preoccupied in thinking about something else. Anyhow, my father's fears were dissipated no later than the following evening. As we returned from a long walk we saw, near the Pont-Vieux, Legrandin himself, who, on account of the holidays, was spending a few days more in Combray. He came up to us with outstretched hand: \"Do you know, master book-lover,\" he asked me, \"this line of Paul Desjardins?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this? Perhaps you have never read Paul Desjardins. Read him, my boy, read him; in these days he is converted, they tell me, into a preaching friar, but he used to have the most charming water-colour touch\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May you always see a blue sky overhead, my young friend; and then, even when the time comes, which is coming now for me, when the woods are all black, when night is fast falling, you will be able to console yourself, as I am doing, by looking up to the sky.\" He took a cigarette from his pocket and stood for a long time, his eyes fixed on the horizon. \"Goodbye, friends!\" he suddenly exclaimed, and left us.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the hour when I usually went downstairs to find out what there was for dinner, its preparation would already have begun, and Fran\u00e7oise, a colonel with all the forces of nature for her subalterns, as in the fairy-tales where giants hire themselves out as scullions, would be stirring the coals, putting the potatoes to steam, and, at the right moment, finishing over the fire those culinary masterpieces which had been first got ready in some of the great array of vessels, triumphs of the potter's craft, which ranged from tubs and boilers and cauldrons and fish kettles down to jars for game, moulds for pastry, and tiny pannikins for cream, and included an entire collection of pots and pans of every shape and size. I would stop by the table, where the kitchen-maid had shelled them, to inspect the platoons of peas, drawn up in ranks and numbered, like little green marbles, ready for a game; but what fascinated me would be the asparagus, tinged with ultramarine and rosy pink which ran from their heads, finely stippled in mauve and azure, through a series of imperceptible changes to their white feet, still stained a little by the soil of their garden-bed: a rainbow-loveliness that was not of this world. I felt that these celestial hues indicated the presence of exquisite creatures who had been pleased to assume vegetable form, who, through the disguise which covered their firm and edible flesh, allowed me to discern in this radiance of earliest dawn, these hinted rainbows, these blue evening shades, that precious quality which I should recognise again when, all night long after a dinner at which I had partaken of them, they played (lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in Shakespeare's Dream) at transforming my humble chamber into a bower of aromatic perfume.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Poor Giotto's Charity, as Swann had named her, charged by Fran\u00e7oise with the task of preparing them for the table, would have them lying beside her in a basket; sitting with a mournful air, as though all the sorrows of the world were heaped upon her; and the light crowns of azure which capped the asparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and separately outlined, star by star, as in Giotto's fresco are the flowers banded about the brows, or patterning the basket of his Virtue at Padua. And, meanwhile, Fran\u00e7oise would be turning on the spit one of those chickens, such as she alone knew how to roast, chickens which had wafted far abroad from Combray the sweet savour of her merits, and which, while she was serving them to us at table, would make the quality of kindness predominate for the moment in my private conception of her character; the aroma of that cooked flesh, which she knew how to make so unctuous and so tender, seeming to me no more than the proper perfume of one of her many virtues.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the day on which, while my father took counsel with his family upon our strange meeting with Legrandin, I went down to the kitchen, was one of those days when Giotto's Charity, still very weak and ill after her recent confinement, had been unable to rise from her bed; Fran\u00e7oise, being without assistance, had fallen into arrears. When I went in, I saw her in the back-kitchen which opened on to the courtyard, in process of killing a chicken; by its desperate and quite natural resistance, which Fran\u00e7oise, beside herself with rage as she attempted to slit its throat beneath the ear, accompanied with shrill cries of \"Filthy creature! Filthy creature!\" it made the saintly kindness and unction of our servant rather less prominent than it would do, next day at dinner, when it made its appearance in a skin gold-embroidered like a chasuble, and its precious juice was poured out drop by drop as from a pyx. When it was dead Fran\u00e7oise mopped up its streaming blood, in which, however, she did not let her rancour drown, for she gave vent to another burst of rage, and, gazing down at the carcass of her enemy, uttered a final \"Filthy creature!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I crept out of the kitchen and upstairs, trembling all over; I could have prayed, then, for the instant dismissal of Fran\u00e7oise. But who would have baked me such hot rolls, boiled me such fragrant coffee, and even\u2014roasted me such chickens? And, as it happened, everyone else had already had to make the same cowardly reckoning. For my aunt L\u00e9onie knew (though I was still in ignorance of this) that Fran\u00e7oise, who, for her own daughter or for her nephews, would have given her life without a murmur, shewed a singular implacability in her dealings with the rest of the world. In spite of which my aunt still retained her, for, while conscious of her cruelty, she could appreciate her services. I began gradually to realise that Fran\u00e7oise's kindness, her compunction, the sum total of her virtues concealed many of these back-kitchen tragedies, just as history reveals to us that the reigns of the kings and queens who are portrayed as kneeling with clasped hands in the windows of churches, were stained by oppression and bloodshed. I had taken note of the fact that, apart from her own kinsfolk, the sufferings of humanity inspired in her a pity which increased in direct ratio to the distance separating the sufferers from herself. The tears which flowed from her in torrents when she read of the misfortunes of persons unknown to her, in a newspaper, were quickly stemmed once she had been able to form a more accurate mental picture of the victims. One night, shortly after her confinement, the kitchen-maid was seized with the most appalling pains; Mamma heard her groans, and rose and awakened Fran\u00e7oise, who, quite unmoved, declared that all the outcry was mere malingering, that the girl wanted to 'play the mistress' in the house. The doctor, who had been afraid of some such attack, had left a marker in a medical dictionary which we had, at the page on which the symptoms were described, and had told us to turn up this passage, where we would find the measures of 'first aid' to be adopted. My mother sent Fran\u00e7oise to fetch the book, warning her not to let the marker drop out. An hour elapsed, and Fran\u00e7oise had not returned; my mother, supposing that she had gone back to bed, grew vexed, and told me to go myself to the bookcase and fetch the volume. I did so, and there found Fran\u00e7oise who, in her curiosity to know what the marker indicated, had begun to read the clinical account of these after-pains, and was violently sobbing, now that it was a question of a type of illness with which she was not familiar. At each painful symptom mentioned by the writer she would exclaim: \"Oh, oh, Holy Virgin, is it possible that God wishes any wretched human creature to suffer so? Oh, the poor girl!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But when I had called her, and she had returned to the bedside of Giotto's Charity, her tears at once ceased to flow; she could find no stimulus for that pleasant sensation of tenderness and pity which she very well knew, having been moved to it often enough by the perusal of newspapers; nor any other pleasure of the same kind in her sense of weariness and irritation at being pulled out of bed in the middle of the night for the kitchen-maid; so that at the sight of those very sufferings, the printed account of which had moved her to tears, she had nothing to offer but ill-tempered mutterings, mingled with bitter sarcasm, saying, when she thought that we had gone out of earshot: \"Well, she need never have done what she must have done to bring all this about! She found that pleasant enough, I dare say! She had better not put on any airs now. All the same, he must have been a god-forsaken young man to go after that. Dear, dear, it's just as they used to say in my poor mother's country:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Snaps and snails and puppy-dogs' tails\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And dirty sluts in plenty\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Smell sweeter than roses in young men's noses\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the heart is one-and-twenty.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although, when her grandson had a slight cold in his head, she would Bet off at night, even if she were ill also, instead of going to bed, to see whether he had everything that he wanted, covering ten miles on foot before daybreak so as to be in time to begin her work, this same love for her own people, and her desire to establish the future greatness of her house on a solid foundation reacted, in her policy with regard to the other servants, in one unvarying maxim, which was never to let any of them set foot in my aunt's room; indeed she shewed a sort of pride in not allowing anyone else to come near my aunt, preferring, when she herself was ill, to get out of bed and to administer the Vichy water in person, rather than to concede to the kitchen-maid the right of entry into her mistress's presence. There is a species of hymenoptera, observed by Fabre, the burrowing wasp, which in order to provide a supply of fresh meat for her offspring after her own decease, calls in the science of anatomy to amplify the resources of her instinctive cruelty, and, having made a collection of weevils and spiders, proceeds with marvellous knowledge and skill to pierce the nerve-centre on which their power of locomotion (but none of their other vital functions) depends, so that the paralysed insect, beside which her egg is laid, will furnish the larva, when it is hatched, with a tamed and inoffensive quarry, incapable either of flight or of resistance, but perfectly fresh for the larder: in the same way Fran\u00e7oise had adopted, to minister to her permanent and unfaltering resolution to render the house uninhabitable to any other servant, a series of crafty and pitiless stratagems. Many years later we discovered that, if we had been fed on asparagus day after day throughout that whole season, it was because the smell of the plants gave the poor kitchen-maid, who had to prepare them, such violent attacks of asthma that she was finally obliged to leave my aunt's service.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas! we had definitely to alter our opinion of M. Legrandin. On one-of the Sundays following our meeting with him on the Pont-Vieux, after which my father had been forced to confess himself mistaken, as mass drew to an end, and, with the sunshine and the noise of the outer world, something else invaded the church, an atmosphere so far from sacred that Mme. Goupil, Mme. Percepied (all those, in fact, who a moment ago, when I arrived a little late, had been sitting motionless, their eyes fixed on their prayer-books; who, I might even have thought, had not seen me come in, had not their feet moved slightly to push away the little kneeling-desk which was preventing me from getting to my chair) began in loud voices to discuss with us all manner of utterly mundane topics, as though we were already outside in the Square, we saw, standing on the sun-baked steps of the porch, dominating the many-coloured tumult of the market, Legrandin himself, whom the husband of the lady we had seen with him, on the previous occasion, was just going to introduce to the wife of another large landed proprietor of the district. Legrandin's face shewed an extraordinary zeal and animation; he made a profound bow, with a subsidiary backward movement which brought his spine sharply up into a position behind its starting-point, a gesture in which he must have been trained by the husband of his sister, Mme. de Cambremer. This rapid recovery caused a sort of tense muscular wave to ripple over Legrandin's hips, which I had not supposed to be so fleshy; I cannot say why, but this undulation of pure matter, this wholly carnal fluency, with not the least hint in it of spiritual significance, this wave lashed to a fury by the wind of an assiduity, an obsequiousness of the basest sort, awoke my mind suddenly to the possibility of a Legrandin altogether different from the one whom we knew. The lady gave him some message for her coachman, and while he was stepping down to her carriage the impression of joy, timid and devout, which the introduction had stamped there, still lingered on his face. Carried away in a sort of dream, he smiled, then he began to hurry back towards the lady; he was walking faster than usual, and his shoulders swayed backwards and forwards, right and left, in the most absurd fashion; altogether he looked, so utterly had he abandoned himself to it, ignoring all other considerations, as though he were the lifeless and wire-pulled puppet of his own happiness. Meanwhile we were coming out through the porch; we were passing close beside him; he was too well bred to turn his head away; but he fixed his eyes, which had suddenly changed to those of a seer, lost in the profundity of his vision, on so distant a point of the horizon that he could not see us, and so had not to acknowledge our presence. His face emerged, still with an air of innocence, from his straight and pliant coat, which looked as though conscious of having been led astray, in spite of itself, and plunged into surroundings of a detested splendour. And a spotted necktie, stirred by the breezes of the Square, continued to float in front of Legrandin, like the standard of his proud isolation, of his noble independence. Just as we reached the house my mother discovered that we had forgotten the 'Saint-Honor\u00e9,' and asked my father to go back with me and tell them to send it up at once. Near the church we met Legrandin, coming towards us with the same lady, whom he was escorting to her carriage. He brushed past us, and did not interrupt what he was saying to her, but gave us, out of the corner of his blue eye, a little sign, which began and ended, so to speak, inside his eyelids, and as it did not involve the least movement of his facial muscles, managed to pass quite unperceived by the lady; but, striving to compensate by the intensity of his feelings for the somewhat restricted field in which they had to find expression, he made that blue chink, which was set apart for us, sparkle with all the animation of cordiality, which went far beyond mere playfulness, and almost touched the border-line of roguery; he subtilised the refinements of good-fellowship into a wink of connivance, a hint, a hidden meaning, a secret understanding, all the mysteries of complicity in a plot, and finally exalted his assurances of friendship to the level of protestations of affection, even of a declaration of love, lighting up for us, and for us alone, with a secret and languid flame invisible by the great lady upon his other side, an enamoured pupil in a countenance of ice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only the day before he had asked my parents to send me to dine with him on this same Sunday evening. \"Come and bear your aged friend company,\" he had said to me. \"Like the nosegay which a traveller sends us from some land to which we shall never go again, come and let me breathe from the far country of your adolescence the scent of those flowers of spring among which I also used to wander, many years ago. Come with the primrose, with the canon's beard, with the gold-cup; come with the stone-crop, whereof are posies made, pledges of love, in the Balzacian flora, come with that flower of the Resurrection morning, the Easter daisy, come with the snowballs of the guelder-rose, which begin to embalm with their fragrance the alleys of your great-aunt's garden ere the last snows of Lent are melted from its soil. Come with the glorious silken raiment of the lily, apparel fit for Solomon, and with the many-coloured enamel of the pansies, but come, above all, with the spring breeze, still cooled by the last frosts of winter, wafting apart, for the two butterflies' sake, that have waited outside all morning, the closed portals of the first Jerusalem rose.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question was raised at home whether, all things considered, I ought still to be sent to dine with M. Legrandin. But my grandmother refused to believe that he could have been impolite.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You admit yourself that he appears at church there, quite simply dressed, and all that; he hardly looks like a man of fashion.\" She added that; in any event, even if, at the worst, he had been intentionally rude, it was far better for us to pretend that we had noticed nothing. And indeed my father himself, though more annoyed than any of us by the attitude which Legrandin had adopted, may still have held in reserve a final uncertainty as to its true meaning. It was like every attitude or action which reveals a man's deep and hidden character; they bear no relation to what he has previously said, and we cannot confirm our suspicions by the culprit's evidence, for he will admit nothing; we are reduced to the evidence of our own senses, and we ask ourselves, in the face of this detached and incoherent fragment of recollection, whether indeed our senses have not been the victims of a hallucination; with the result that such attitudes, and these alone are of importance in indicating character, are the most apt to leave us in perplexity.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I dined with Legrandin on the terrace of his house, by moonlight. \"There is a charming quality, is there not,\" he said to me, \"in this silence; for hearts that are wounded, as mine is, a novelist, whom you will read in time to come, claims that there is no remedy but silence and shadow. And see you this, my boy, there comes in all lives a time, towards which you still have far to go, when the weary eyes can endure but one kind of light, the light which a fine evening like this prepares for us in the stillroom of darkness, when the ears can listen to no music save what the moonlight breathes through the flute of silence.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could hear what M. Legrandin was saying; like everything that he said, it sounded attractive; but I was disturbed by the memory of a lady whom I had seen recently for the first time; and thinking, now that I knew that Legrandin was on friendly terms with several of the local aristocracy, that perhaps she also was among his acquaintance, I summoned up all my courage and said to him: \"Tell me, sir, do you, by any chance, know the lady\u2014the ladies of Guermantes?\" and I felt glad because, in pronouncing the name, I had secured a sort of power over it, by the mere act of drawing it up out of my dreams and giving it an objective existence in the world of spoken things\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, at the sound of the word Guermantes, I saw in the middle of each of our friend's blue eyes a little brown dimple appear, as though they had been stabbed by some invisible pin-point, while the rest of his pupils, reacting from the shock, received and secreted the azure overflow. His fringed eyelids darkened, and drooped. His mouth, which had been stiffened and seared with bitter lines, was the first to recover, and smiled, while his eyes still seemed full of pain, like the eyes of a good-looking martyr whose body bristles with arrows\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, I do not know them,\" he said, but instead of uttering so simple a piece of information, a reply in which there was so little that could astonish me, in the natural and conversational tone which would have befitted it, he recited it with a separate stress upon each word, leaning forward, bowing his head, with at once the vehemence which a man gives, so as to be believed, to a highly improbable statement (as though the fact that he did not know the Guermantes could be due only to some strange accident of fortune) and with the emphasis of a man who, finding himself unable to keep silence about what is to him a painful situation, chooses to proclaim it aloud, so as to convince his hearers that the confession he is making is one that causes him no embarrassment, but is easy, agreeable, spontaneous, that the situation in question, in this case the absence of relations with the Guermantes family, might very well have been not forced upon, but actually designed by Legrandin himself, might arise from some family tradition, some moral principle or mystical vow which expressly forbade his seeking their society\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No,\" he resumed, explaining by his words the tone in which they were uttered. \"No, I do not know them; I have never wished to know them; I have always made a point of preserving complete independence; at heart, as you know, I am a bit of a Radical. People are always coming to me about it, telling me I am mistaken in not going to Guermantes, that I make myself seem ill-bred, uncivilised, an old bear. But that's not the sort of reputation that can frighten me; it's too true! In my heart of hearts I care for nothing in the world now but a few churches, books\u2014two or three, pictures\u2014rather more, perhaps, and the light of the moon when the fresh breeze of youth (such as yours) wafts to my nostrils the scent of gardens whose flowers my old eyes are not sharp enough, now, to distinguish.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not understand very clearly why, in order to refrain from going to the houses of people whom one did not know, it should be necessary to cling to one's independence, nor how that could give one the appearance of a savage or a bear. But what I did understand was this, that Legrandin was not altogether truthful when he said that he cared only for churches, moonlight, and youth; he cared also, he cared a very great deal, for people who lived in country houses, and would be so much afraid, when in their company, of incurring their displeasure that he would never dare to let them see that he numbered, as well, among his friends middle-class people, the families of solicitors and stockbrokers, preferring, if the truth must be known, that it should be revealed in his absence, when he was out of earshot, that judgment should go against him (if so it must) by default: in a word, he was a snob. Of course he would never have admitted all or any of this in the poetical language which my family and I so much admired. And if I asked him, \"Do you know the Guermantes family?\" Legrandin the talker would reply, \"No, I have never cared to know them.\" But unfortunately the talker was now subordinated to another Legrandin, whom he kept carefully hidden in his breast, whom he would never consciously exhibit, because this other could tell stories about our own Legrandin and about his snobbishness which would have ruined his reputation for ever; and this other Legrandin had replied to me already in that wounded look, that stiffened smile, the undue gravity of his tone in uttering those few words, in the thousand arrows by which our own Legrandin had instantaneously been stabbed and sickened, like a Saint Sebastian of snobbery:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, how you hurt me! No, I do not know the Guermantes family. Do not remind me of the great sorrow of my life.\" And since this other, this irrepressible, dominant, despotic Legrandin, if he lacked our Legrandin's charming vocabulary, shewed an infinitely greater promptness in expressing himself, by means of what are called 'reflexes,' it followed that, when Legrandin the talker attempted to silence him, he would already have spoken, and it would be useless for our friend to deplore the bad impression which the revelations of his alter ego must have caused, since he could do no more now than endeavour to mitigate them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was not to say that M. Legrandin was anything but sincere when he inveighed against snobs. He could not (from his own knowledge, at least) be aware that he was one also, since it is only with the passions of others that we are ever really familiar, and what we come to find out about our own can be no more than what other people have shewn us. Upon ourselves they react but indirectly, through our imagination, which substitutes for our actual, primary motives other, secondary motives, less stark and therefore more decent. Never had Legrandin's snobbishness impelled him to make a habit of visiting a duchess as such. Instead, it would set his imagination to make that duchess appear, in Legrandin's eyes, endowed with all the graces. He would be drawn towards the duchess, assuring himself the while that he was yielding to the attractions of her mind, and her other virtues, which the vile race of snobs could never understand. Only his fellow-snobs knew that he was of their number, for, owing to their inability to appreciate the intervening efforts of his imagination, they saw in close juxtaposition the social activities of Legrandin and their primary cause\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At home, meanwhile, we had no longer any illusions as to M. Legrandin, and our relations with him had become much more distant. Mamma would be greatly delighted whenever she caught him red-handed in the sin, which he continued to call the unpardonable sin, of snobbery. As for my father, he found it difficult to take Legrandin's airs in so light, in so detached a spirit; and when there was some talk, one year, of sending me to spend the long summer holidays at Balbec with my grandmother, he said: \"I must, most certainly, tell Legrandin that you are going to Balbec, to see whether he will offer you an introduction to his sister. He probably doesn't remember telling us that she lived within a mile of the place.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother, who held that, when one went to the seaside, one ought to be on the beach from morning to night, to taste the salt breezes, and that one should not know anyone in the place, because calls and parties and excursions were so much time stolen from what belonged, by rights, to the sea-air, begged him on no account to speak to Legrandin of our plans; for already, in her mind's eye, she could see his sister, Mme. de Cambremer, alighting from her carriage at the door of our hotel just as we were on the point of going out fishing, and obliging us to remain indoors all afternoon to entertain her. But Mamma laughed her fears to scorn, for she herself felt that the danger was not so threatening, and that Legrandin would shew no undue anxiety to make us acquainted with his sister. And, as it happened, there was no need for any of us to introduce the subject of Balbec, for it was Legrandin himself who, without the least suspicion that we had ever had any intention of visiting those parts, walked into the trap uninvited one evening, when we met him strolling on the banks of the Vivonne\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which are very beautiful, are they not, my friend?\" he said to my father. \"Especially a blue which is far more floral than atmospheric, a cineraria blue, which it is surprising to see in the sky. And that little pink cloud there, has it not just the tint of some flower, a carnation or hydrangea? Nowhere, perhaps, except on the shores of the English Channel, where Normandy merges into Brittany, have I been able to find such copious examples of what you might call a vegetable kingdom in the clouds. Down there, close to Balbec, among all those places which are still so uncivilised, there is a little bay, charmingly quiet, where the sunsets of the Auge Valley, those red-and-gold sunsets (which, all the same, I am very far from despising) seem commonplace and insignificant; for in that moist and gentle atmosphere these heavenly flower-beds will break into blossom, in a few moments, in the evenings, incomparably lovely, and often lasting for hours before they fade. Others shed their leaves at once, and then it is more beautiful still to see the sky strewn with the scattering of their innumerable petals, sulphurous yellow and rosy red. In that bay, which they call the Opal Bay, the golden sands appear more charming still from being fastened, like fair Andromeda, to those terrible rocks of the surrounding coast, to that funereal shore, famed for the number of its wrecks, where every winter many a brave vessel falls a victim to the perils of the sea. Balbec! the oldest bone in the geological skeleton that underlies our soil, the true Armor, the sea, the land's end, the accursed region which Anatole France\u2014an enchanter whose works our young friend ought to read\u2014has so well depicted, beneath its eternal fogs, as though it were indeed the land of the Cimmerians in the Odyssey. Balbec; yes, they are building hotels there now, superimposing them upon its ancient and charming soil, which they are powerless to alter; how delightful it is, down there, to be able to step out at once into regions so primitive and so entrancing.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Indeed! And do you know anyone at Balbec?\" inquired my father. \"This young man is just going to spend a couple of months there with his grandmother, and my wife too, perhaps.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legrandin, taken unawares by the question at a moment when he was looking directly at my father, was unable to turn aside his gaze, and so concentrated it with steadily increasing intensity\u2014smiling mournfully the while\u2014upon the eyes of his questioner, with an air of friendliness and frankness and of not being afraid to look him in the face, until he seemed to have penetrated my father's skull, as it had been a ball of glass, and to be seeing, at the moment, a long way beyond and behind it, a brightly coloured cloud, which provided him with a mental alibi, and would enable him to establish the theory that, just when he was being asked whether he knew anyone at Balbec, he had been thinking of something else, and so had not heard the question. As a rule these tactics make the questioner proceed to ask, \"Why, what are you thinking about?\" But my father, inquisitive, annoyed, and cruel, repeated: \"Have you friends, then, in that neighbourhood, that you know Balbec so well?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a final and desperate effort the smiling gaze of Legrandin struggled to the extreme limits of its tenderness, vagueness, candour, and distraction; then feeling, no doubt, that there was nothing left for it now but to answer, he said to us: \"I have friends all the world over, wherever there are companies of trees, stricken but not defeated, which have come together to offer a common supplication, with pathetic obstinacy, to an inclement sky which has no mercy upon them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That is not quite what I meant,\" interrupted my father, obstinate as a tree and merciless as the sky. \"I asked you, in case anything should happen to my mother-in-law and she wanted to feel that she was not all alone down there, at the ends of the earth, whether you knew any of the people.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There as elsewhere, I know everyone and I know no one,\" replied Legrandin, who was by no means ready yet to surrender; \"places I know well, people very slightly. But, down there, the places themselves seem to me just like people, rare and wonderful people, of a delicate quality which would have been corrupted and ruined by the gift of life. Perhaps it is a castle which you encounter upon the cliff's edge; standing there by the roadside, where it has halted to contemplate its sorrows before an evening sky, still rosy, through which a golden moon is climbing; while the fishing-boats, homeward bound, creasing the watered silk of the Channel, hoist its pennant at their mastheads and carry its colours. Or perhaps it is a simple dwelling-house that stands alone, ugly, if anything, timid-seeming but full of romance, hiding from every eye some imperishable secret of happiness and disenchantment. That land which knows not truth,\" he continued with Machiavellian subtlety, \"that land of infinite fiction makes bad reading for any boy; and is certainly not what I should choose or recommend for my young friend here, who is already so much inclined to melancholy, for a heart already predisposed to receive its impressions. Climates that breathe amorous secrets and futile regrets may agree with an old and disillusioned man like myself; but they must always prove fatal to a temperament which is still unformed. Believe me,\" he went on with emphasis, \"the waters of that bay\u2014more Breton than Norman\u2014may exert a sedative influence, though even that is of questionable value, upon a heart which, like mine, is no longer unbroken, a heart for whose wounds there is no longer anything to compensate. But at your age, my boy, those waters are contra-indicated.... Good night to you, neighbours,\" he added, moving away from us with that evasive abruptness to which we were accustomed; and then, turning towards us, with a physicianly finger raised in warning, he resumed the consultation: \"No Balbec before you are fifty!\" he called out to me, \"and even then it must depend on the state of the heart.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father spoke to him of it again, as often as we met him, and tortured him with questions, but it was labour in vain: like that scholarly swindler who devoted to the fabrication of forged palimpsests a wealth of skill and knowledge and industry the hundredth part of which would have sufficed to establish him in a more lucrative\u2014but an honourable occupation, M. Legrandin, had we insisted further, would in the end have constructed a whole system of ethics, and a celestial geography of Lower Normandy, sooner than admit to us that, within a mile of Balbec, his own sister was living in her own house; sooner than find himself obliged to offer us a letter of introduction, the prospect of which would never have inspired him with such terror had he been absolutely certain\u2014as, from his knowledge of my grandmother's character, he really ought to have been certain\u2014that in no circumstances whatsoever would we have dreamed of making use of it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We used always to return from our walks in good time to pay aunt L\u00e9onie a visit before dinner. In the first weeks of our Combray holidays, when the days ended early, we would still be able to see, as we turned into the Rue du Saint-Esprit, a reflection of the western sky from the windows of the house and a band of purple at the foot of the Calvary, which was mirrored further on in the pond; a fiery glow which, accompanied often by a cold that burned and stung, would associate itself in my mind with the glow of the fire over which, at that very moment, was roasting the chicken that was to furnish me, in place of the poetic pleasure I had found in my walk, with the sensual pleasures of good feeding, warmth and rest. But in summer, when we came back to the house, the sun would not have set; and while we were upstairs paying our visit to aunt L\u00e9onie its rays, sinking until they touched and lay along her window-sill, would there be caught and held by the large inner curtains and the bands which tied them back to the wall, and split and scattered and filtered; and then, at last, would fall upon and inlay with tiny flakes of gold the lemonwood of her chest-of-drawers, illuminating the room in their passage with the same delicate, slanting, shadowed beams that fall among the boles of forest trees. But on some days, though very rarely, the chest-of-drawers would long since have shed its momentary adornments, there would no longer, as we turned into the Rue du Saint-Esprit, be any reflection from the western sky burning along the line of window-panes; the pond beneath the Calvary would have lost its fiery glow, sometimes indeed had changed already to an opalescent pallor, while a long ribbon of moonlight, bent and broken and broadened by every ripple upon the water's surface, would be lying across it, from end to end. Then, as we drew near the house, we would make out a figure standing upon the doorstep, and Mamma would say to me: \"Good heavens! There is Fran\u00e7oise looking out for us; your aunt must be anxious; that means we are late.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And without wasting time by stopping to take off our 'things' we would fly upstairs to my aunt L\u00e9onie's room to reassure her, to prove to her by our bodily presence that all her gloomy imaginings were false, that, on the contrary, nothing had happened to us, but that we had gone the 'Guermantes way,' and, good lord, when one took that walk, my aunt knew well enough that one could never say at what time one would be home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There, Fran\u00e7oise,\" my aunt would say, \"didn't I tell you that they must have gone the Guermantes way? Good gracious! They must be hungry! And your nice leg of mutton will be quite dried up now, after all the hours it's been waiting. What a time to come in! Well, and so you went the Guermantes way?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, Leonie, I supposed you knew,\" Mamma would answer. \"I thought that Fran\u00e7oise had seen us go out by the little gate, through the kitchen-garden.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For there were, in the environs of Combray, two 'ways' which we used to take for our walks, and so diametrically opposed that we would actually leave the house by a different door, according to the way we had chosen: the way towards M\u00e9s\u00e9glise-la-Vineuse, which we called also 'Swann's way,' because, to get there, one had to pass along the boundary of M. Swann's estate, and the 'Guermantes way.' Of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise-la-Vineuse, to tell the truth, I never knew anything more than the way there, and the strange people who would come over on Sundays to take the air in Combray, people whom, this time, neither my aunt nor any of us would 'know at all,' and whom we would therefore assume to be 'people who must have come over from M\u00e9s\u00e9glise.' As for Guermantes, I was to know it well enough one day, but that day had still to come; and, during the whole of my boyhood, if M\u00e9s\u00e9glise was to me something as inaccessible as the horizon, which remained hidden from sight, however far one went, by the folds of a country which no longer bore the least resemblance to the country round Combray; Guermantes, on the other hand, meant no more than the ultimate goal, ideal rather than real, of the 'Guermantes way,' a sort of abstract geographical term like the North Pole or the Equator. And so to 'take the Guermantes way' in order to get to M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, or vice versa, would have seemed to me as nonsensical a proceeding as to turn to the east in order to reach the west. Since my father used always to speak of the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' as comprising the finest view of a plain that he knew anywhere, and of the 'Guermantes way' as typical of river scenery, I had invested each of them, by conceiving them in this way as two distinct entities, with that cohesion, that unity which belongs only to the figments of the mind; the smallest detail of either of them appeared to me as a precious thing, which exhibited the special excellence of the whole, while, immediately beside them, in the first stages of our walk, before we had reached the sacred soil of one or the other, the purely material roads, at definite points on which they were set down as the ideal view over a plain and the ideal scenery of a river, were no more worth the trouble of looking at them than, to a keen playgoer and lover of dramatic art, are the little streets which may happen to run past the walls of a theatre. But, above all, I set between them, far more distinctly than the mere distance in miles and yards and inches which separated one from the other, the distance that there was between the two parts of my brain in which I used to think of them, one of those distances of the mind which time serves only to lengthen, which separate things irremediably from one another, keeping them for ever upon different planes. And this distinction was rendered still more absolute because the habit we had of never going both ways on the same day, or in the course of the same walk, but the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' one time and the 'Guermantes way' another, shut them up, so to speak, far apart and unaware of each other's existence, in the sealed vessels\u2014between which there could be no communication\u2014of separate afternoons\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When we had decided to go the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' we would start (without undue haste, and even if the sky were clouded over, since the walk was not very long, and did not take us too far from home), as though we were not going anywhere in particular, by the front-door of my aunt's house, which opened on to the Rue du Saint-Esprit. We would be greeted by the gunsmith, we would drop our letters into the box, we would tell Th\u00e9odore, from Fran\u00e7oise, as we passed, that she had run out of oil or coffee, and we would leave the town by the road which ran along the white fence of M. Swann's park. Before reaching it we would be met on our way by the scent of his lilac-trees, come out to welcome strangers. Out of the fresh little green hearts of their foliage the lilacs raised inquisitively over the fence of the park their plumes of white or purple blossom, which glowed, even in the shade, with the sunlight in which they had been bathed. Some of them, half-concealed by the little tiled house, called the Archers' Lodge, in which Swann's keeper lived, overtopped its gothic gable with their rosy minaret. The nymphs of spring would have seemed coarse and vulgar in comparison with these young houris, who retained, in this French garden, the pure and vivid colouring of a Persian miniature. Despite my desire to throw my arms about their pliant forms and to draw down towards me the starry locks that crowned their fragrant heads, we would pass them by without stopping, for my parents had ceased to visit Tansonville since Swann's marriage, and, so as not to appear to be looking into his park, we would, instead of taking the road which ran beside its boundary and then climbed straight up to the open fields, choose another way, which led in the same direction, but circuitously, and brought us out rather too far from home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day my grandfather said to my 'father: \"Don't you remember Swann's telling us yesterday that his wife and daughter had gone off to Rheims and that he was taking the opportunity of spending a day or two in Paris? We might go along by the park, since the ladies are not at home; that will make it a little shorter.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We stopped for a moment by the fence. Lilac-time was nearly over; some of the trees still thrust aloft, in tall purple chandeliers, their tiny balls of blossom, but in many places among their foliage where, only a week before, they had still been breaking in waves of fragrant foam, these were now spent and shrivelled and discoloured, a hollow scum, dry and scentless. My grandfather pointed out to my father in what respects the appearance of the place was still the same, and how far it had altered since the walk that he had taken with old M. Swann, on the day of his wife's death; and he seized the opportunity to tell us, once again, the story of that walk\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In front of us a path bordered with nasturtiums rose in the full glare of the sun towards the house. But to our right the park stretched away into the distance, on level ground. Overshadowed by the tall trees which stood close around it, an 'ornamental water' had been constructed by Swann's parents but, even in his most artificial creations, nature is the material upon which man has to work; certain spots will persist in remaining surrounded by the vassals of their own especial sovereignty, and will raise their immemorial standards among all the 'laid-out' scenery of a park, just as they would have done far from any human interference, in a solitude which must everywhere return to engulf them, springing up out of the necessities of their exposed position, and superimposing itself upon the work of man's hands. And so it was that, at the foot of the path which led down to this artificial lake, there might be seen, in its two tiers woven of trailing forget-me-nots below and of periwinkle flowers above, the natural, delicate, blue garland which binds the luminous, shadowed brows of water-nymphs; while the iris, its swords sweeping every way in regal profusion, stretched out over agrimony and water-growing king-cups the lilied sceptres, tattered glories of yellow and purple, of the kingdom of the lake\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The absence of Mlle. Swann, which\u2014since it preserved me from the terrible risk of seeing her appear on one of the paths, and of being identified and scorned by this so privileged little girl who had Bergotte for a friend and used to go with him to visit cathedrals\u2014made the exploration of Tansonville, now for the first time permitted me, a matter of indifference to myself, seemed however to invest the property, in my grandfather's and father's eyes, with a fresh and transient charm, and (like an entirely cloudless sky when one is going mountaineering) to make the day extraordinarily propitious for a walk in this direction; I should have liked to see their reckoning proved false, to see, by a miracle, Mlle. Swann appear, with her father, so close to us that we should not have time to escape, and should therefore be obliged to make her acquaintance. And so, when I suddenly noticed a straw basket lying forgotten on the grass by the side of a line whose float was bobbing in the water, I made a great effort to keep my father and grandfather looking in another direction, away from this sign that she might, after all, be in residence. Still, as Swann had told us that he ought not, really, to go away just then, as he had some people staying in the house, the line might equally belong to one of these guests. Not a footstep was to be heard on any of the paths. Somewhere in one of the tall trees, making a stage in its height, an invisible bird, desperately attempting to make the day seem shorter, was exploring with a long, continuous note the solitude that pressed it on every side, but it received at once so unanimous an answer, so powerful a repercussion of silence and of immobility that, one would have said, it had arrested for all eternity the moment which it had been trying to make pass more quickly. The sunlight fell so implacably from a fixed sky that one was naturally inclined to slip away out of the reach of its attentions, and even the slumbering water, whose repose was perpetually being invaded by the insects that swarmed above its surface, while it dreamed, no doubt, of some imaginary maelstrom, intensified the uneasiness which the sight of that floating cork had wrought in me, by appearing to draw it at full speed across the silent reaches of a mirrored firmament; now almost vertical, it seemed on the point of plunging down out of sight, and I had begun to ask myself whether, setting aside the longing and the terror that I had of making her acquaintance, it was not actually my duty to warn Mlle. Swann that the fish was biting\u2014when I was obliged to run after my father and grandfather, who were calling me, and were surprised that I had not followed them along the little path, climbing up hill towards the open fields, into which they had already turned. I found the whole path throbbing with the fragrance of hawthorn-blossom. The hedge resembled a series of chapels, whose walls were no longer visible under the mountains of flowers that were heaped upon their altars; while underneath, the sun cast a square of light upon the ground, as though it had shone in upon them through a window; the scent that swept out over me from them was as rich, and as circumscribed in its range, as though I had been standing before the Lady-altar, and the flowers, themselves adorned also, held out each its little bunch of glittering stamens with an air of inattention, fine, radiating 'nerves' in the flamboyant style of architecture, like those which, in church, framed the stair to the rood-loft or closed the perpendicular tracery of the windows, but here spread out into pools of fleshy white, like strawberry-beds in spring. How simple and rustic, in comparison with these, would seem the dog-roses which, in a few weeks' time, would be climbing the same hillside path in the heat of the sun, dressed in the smooth silk of their blushing pink bodices, which would be undone and scattered by the first breath of wind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But it was in vain that I lingered before the hawthorns, to breathe in, to marshal before my mind (which knew not what to make of it), to lose in order to rediscover their invisible and unchanging odour, to absorb myself in the rhythm which disposed their flowers here and there with the light-heartedness of youth, and at intervals as unexpected as certain intervals of music; they offered me an indefinite continuation of the same charm, in an inexhaustible profusion, but without letting me delve into it any more deeply, like those melodies which one can play over a hundred times in succession without coming any nearer to their secret. I turned away from them for a moment so as to be able to return to them with renewed strength. My eyes followed up the slope which, outside the hedge, rose steeply to the fields, a poppy that had strayed and been lost by its fellows, or a few cornflowers that had fallen lazily behind, and decorated the ground here and there with their flowers like the border of a tapestry, in which may be seen at intervals hints of the rustic theme which appears triumphant in the panel itself; infrequent still, spaced apart as the scattered houses which warn us that we are approaching a village, they betokened to me the vast expanse of waving corn beneath the fleecy clouds, and the sight of a single poppy hoisting upon its slender rigging and holding against the breeze its scarlet ensign, over the buoy of rich black earth from which it sprang, made my heart beat as does a wayfarer's when he perceives, upon some low-lying ground, an old and broken boat which is being caulked and made seaworthy, and cries out, although he has not yet caught sight of it, \"The Sea!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then I returned to my hawthorns, and stood before them as one stands before those masterpieces of painting which, one imagines, one will be better able to 'take in' when one has looked away, for a moment, at something else; but in vain did I shape my fingers into a frame, so as to have nothing but the hawthorns before my eyes; the sentiment which they aroused in me remained obscure and vague, struggling and failing to free itself, to float across and become one with the flowers. They themselves offered me no enlightenment, and I could not call upon any other flowers to satisfy this mysterious longing. And then, inspiring me with that rapture which we feel on seeing a work by our favourite painter quite different from any of those that we already know, or, better still, when some one has taken us and set us down in front of a picture of which we have hitherto seen no more than a pencilled sketch, or when a piece of music which we have heard played over on the piano bursts out again in our ears with all the splendour and fullness of an orchestra, my grandfather called me to him, and, pointing to the hedge of Tansonville, said: \"You are fond of hawthorns; just look at this pink one; isn't it pretty?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it was indeed a hawthorn, but one whose flowers were pink, and lovelier even than the white. It, too, was in holiday attire, for one of those days which are the only true holidays, the holy days of religion, because they are not appointed by any capricious accident, as secular holidays are appointed, upon days which are not specially ordained for such observances, which have nothing about them that is essentially festal\u2014but it was attired even more richly than the rest, for the flowers which clung to its branches, one above another, so thickly as to leave no part of the tree undecorated, like the tassels wreathed about the crook of a rococo shepherdess, were every one of them 'in colour,' and consequently of a superior quality, by the aesthetic standards of Combray, to the 'plain,' if one was to judge by the scale of prices at the 'stores' in the Square, or at Camus's, where the most expensive biscuits were those whose sugar was pink. And for my own part I set a higher value on cream cheese when it was pink, when I had been allowed to tinge it with crushed strawberries. And these flowers had chosen precisely the colour of some edible and delicious thing, or of some exquisite addition to one's costume for a great festival, which colours, inasmuch as they make plain the reason for their superiority, are those whose beauty is most evident to the eyes of children, and for that reason must always seem more vivid and more natural than any other tints, even after the child's mind has realised that they offer no gratification to the appetite, and have not been selected by the dressmaker. And, indeed, I had felt at once, as I had felt before the white blossom, but now still more marvelling, that it was in no artificial manner, by no device of human construction, that the festal intention of these flowers was revealed, but that it was Nature herself who had spontaneously expressed it (with the simplicity of a woman from a village shop, labouring at the decoration of a street altar for some procession) by burying the bush in these little rosettes, almost too ravishing in colour, this rustic 'pompadour.' High up on the branches, like so many of those tiny rose-trees, their pots concealed in jackets of paper lace, whose slender stems rise in a forest from the altar on the greater festivals, a thousand buds were swelling and opening, paler in colour, but each disclosing as it burst, as at the bottom of a cup of pink marble, its blood-red stain, and suggesting even more strongly than the full-blown flowers the special, irresistible quality of the hawthorn-tree, which, wherever it budded, wherever it was about to blossom, could bud and blossom in pink flowers alone. Taking its place in the hedge, but as different from the rest as a young girl in holiday attire among a crowd of dowdy women in everyday clothes, who are staying at home, equipped and ready for the 'Month of Mary,' of which it seemed already to form a part, it shone and smiled in its cool, rosy garments, a Catholic bush indeed, and altogether delightful\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The hedge allowed us a glimpse, inside the park, of an alley bordered with jasmine, pansies, and verbenas, among which the stocks held open their fresh plump purses, of a pink as fragrant and as faded as old Spanish leather, while on the gravel-path a long watering-pipe, painted green, coiling across the ground, poured, where its holes were, over the flowers whose perfume those holes inhaled, a vertical and prismatic fan of infinitesimal, rainbow-coloured drops. Suddenly I stood still, unable to move, as happens when something appears that requires not only our eyes to take it in, but involves a deeper kind of perception and takes possession of the whole of our being. A little girl, with fair, reddish hair, who appeared to be returning from a walk, and held a trowel in her hand, was looking at us, raising towards us a face powdered with pinkish freckles. Her black eyes gleamed, and as I did not at that time know, and indeed have never since learned how to reduce to its objective elements any strong impression, since I had not, as they say, enough 'power of observation' to isolate the sense of their colour, for a long time afterwards, whenever I thought of her, the memory of those bright eyes would at once present itself to me as a vivid azure, since her complexion was fair; so much so that, perhaps, if her eyes had not been quite so black\u2014which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her\u2014I should not have been, as I was, especially enamoured of their imagined blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I gazed at her, at first with that gaze which is not merely a messenger from the eyes, but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out, petrified and anxious, that gaze which would fain reach, touch, capture, bear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed, and the soul with the body; then (so frightened was I lest at any moment my grandfather and father, catching sight of the girl, might tear me away from her, by making me run on in front of them) with another, an unconsciously appealing look, whose object was to force her to pay attention to me, to see, to know me. She cast a glance forwards and sideways, so as to take stock of my grandfather and father, and doubtless the impression she formed of them was that we were all absurd people, for she turned away with an indifferent and contemptuous air, withdrew herself so as to spare her face the indignity of remaining within their field of vision; and while they, continuing to walk on without noticing her, had overtaken and passed me, she allowed her eyes to wander, over the space that lay between us, in my direction, without any particular expression, without appearing to have seen me, but with an intensity, a half-hidden smile which I was unable to interpret, according to the instruction I had received in the ways of good breeding, save as a mark of infinite disgust; and her hand, at the same time, sketched in the air an indelicate gesture, for which, when it was addressed in public to a person whom one did not know, the little dictionary of manners which I carried in my mind supplied only one meaning, namely, a deliberate insult\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Gilberte, come along; what are you doing?\" called out in a piercing tone of authority a lady in white, whom I had not seen until that moment, while, a little way beyond her, a gentleman in a suit of linen 'ducks,' whom I did not know either, stared at me with eyes which seemed to be starting from his head; the little girl's smile abruptly faded, and, seizing her trowel, she made off without turning to look again in my direction, with an air of obedience, inscrutable and sly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so was wafted to my ears the name of Gilberte, bestowed on me like a talisman which might, perhaps, enable me some day to rediscover her whom its syllables had just endowed with a definite personality, whereas, a moment earlier, she had been only something vaguely seen. So it came to me, uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines, pungent and cool as the drops which fell from the green watering-pipe; impregnating and irradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed, which it set apart and isolated from all other air, with the mystery of the life of her whom its syllables designated to the happy creatures that lived and walked and travelled in her company; unfolding through the arch of the pink hawthorn, which opened at the height of my shoulder, the quintessence of their familiarity\u2014so exquisitely painful to myself\u2014with her, and with all that unknown world of her existence, into which I should never penetrate\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For a moment (while we moved away, and my grandfather murmured: \"Poor Swann, what a life they are leading him; fancy sending him away so that she can be left alone with her Charlus\u2014for that was Charlus: I recognised him at once! And the child, too; at her age, to be mixed up in all that!\") the impression left on me by the despotic tone in which Gilberte's mother had spoken to her, without her replying, by exhibiting her to me as being obliged to yield obedience to some one else, as not being indeed superior to the whole world, calmed my sufferings somewhat, revived some hope in me, and cooled the ardour of my love. But very soon that love surged up again in me like a reaction by which my humiliated heart was endeavouring to rise to Gilberte's level, or to draw her down to its own. I loved her; I was sorry not to have had the time and the inspiration to insult her, to do her some injury, to force her to keep some memory of me. I knew her to be so beautiful that I should have liked to be able to retrace my steps so as to shake my fist at her and shout, \"I think you are hideous, grotesque; you are utterly disgusting!\" However, I walked away, carrying with me, then and for ever afterwards, as the first illustration of a type of happiness rendered inaccessible to a little boy of my kind by certain laws of nature which it was impossible to transgress, the picture of a little girl with reddish hair, and a skin freckled with tiny pink marks, who held a trowel in her hand, and smiled as she directed towards me a long and subtle and inexpressive stare. And already the charm with which her name, like a cloud of incense, had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn through which she and I had, together, heard its sound, was beginning to conquer, to cover, to embalm, to beautify everything with which it had any association: her grandparents, whom my own had been so unspeakably fortunate as to know, the glorious profession of a stockholder, even the melancholy neighbourhood of the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, where she lived in Paris.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"L\u00e9onie,\" said my grandfather on our return, \"I wish we had had you with us this afternoon. You would never have known Tansonville. If I had had the courage I would have cut you a branch of that pink hawthorn you used to like so much.\" And so my grandfather told her the story of our walk, either just to amuse her, or perhaps because there was still some hope that she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of doors. For in earlier days she had been very fond of Tansonville, and, moreover, Swann's visits had been the last that she had continued to receive, at a time when she had already closed her doors to all the world. And just as, when he called, in these later days, to inquire for her (and she was still the only person in our household whom he would ask to see), she would send down to say that she was tired at the moment and resting, but that she would be happy to see him another time, so, this evening, she said to my grandfather, \"Yes, some day when the weather is fine I shall go for a drive as far as the gate of the park.\" And in saying this she was quite sincere. She would have liked to see Swann and Tansonville again; but the mere wish to do so sufficed for all that remained of her strength, which its fulfilment would have more than exhausted. Sometimes a spell of fine weather made her a little more energetic, she would rise and put on her clothes; but before she had reached the outer room she would be 'tired' again, and would insist on returning to her bed. The process which had begun in her\u2014and in her a little earlier only than it must come to all of us\u2014was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in preparation for death, the chrysalis stage of life, which may be observed wherever life has been unduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived for one another with the utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends bound by the closest ties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year, cease to make, the necessary journey, or even to cross the street to see one another, cease to correspond, and know well that they will communicate no more in this world. My aunt must have been perfectly well aware that she would not see Swann again, that she would never leave her own house any more, but this ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with all the more readiness for the very reason which, to our minds, ought to have made it more unbearable; namely, that such a seclusion was forced upon her by the gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she was able to measure daily, which, by making every action, every movement 'tiring' to her if not actually painful, gave to inaction, isolation and silence the blessed, strengthening and refreshing charm of repose.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My aunt did not go to see the pink hawthorn in the hedge, but at all hours of the day I would ask the rest of my family whether she was not going to go, whether she used not, at one time, to go often to Tansonville, trying to make them speak of Mile. Swann's parents and grandparents, who appeared to me to be as great and glorious as gods. The name, which had for me become almost mythological, of Swann\u2014when I talked with my family I would grow sick with longing to hear them utter it; I dared not pronounce it myself, but I would draw them into a discussion of matters which led naturally to Gilberte and her family, in which she was involved, in speaking of which I would feel myself not too remotely banished from her company; and I would suddenly force my father (by pretending, for instance, to believe that my grandfather's business had been in our family before his day, or that the hedge with the pink hawthorn which my aunt L\u00e9onie wished to visit was on common ground) to correct my statements, to say, as though in opposition to me and of his own accord: \"No, no, the business belonged to Swann's father, that hedge is part of Swann's park.\" And then I would be obliged to pause for breath; so stifling was the pressure, upon that part of me where it was for ever inscribed, of that name which, at the moment when I heard it, seemed to me fuller, more portentous than any other name, because it was burdened with the weight of all the occasions on which I had secretly uttered it in my mind. It caused me a pleasure which I was ashamed to have dared to demand from my parents, for so great was it that to have procured it for me must have involved them in an immensity of effort, and with no recompense, since for them there was no pleasure in the sound. And so I would prudently turn the conversation. And by a scruple of conscience, also. All the singular seductions which I had stored up in the sound of that word Swann, I found again as soon as it was uttered. And then it occurred to me suddenly that my parents could not fail to experience the same emotions, that they must find themselves sharing my point of view, that they perceived in their turn, that they condoned, that they even embraced my visionary longings, and I was as wretched as though I had ravished and corrupted the innocence of their hearts.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That year my family fixed the day of their return to Paris rather earlier than usual. On the morning of our departure I had had my hair curled, to be ready to face the photographer, had had a new hat carefully set upon my head, and had been buttoned into a velvet jacket; a little later my mother, after searching everywhere for me, found me standing in tears on that steep little hillside close to Tansonville, bidding a long farewell to my hawthorns, clasping their sharp branches to my bosom, and (like a princess in a tragedy, oppressed by the weight of all her senseless jewellery) with no gratitude towards the officious hand which had, in curling those ringlets, been at pains to collect all my hair upon my forehead; trampling underfoot the curl-papers which I had torn from my head, and my new hat with them. My mother was not at all moved by my tears, but she could not suppress a cry at the sight of my battered headgear and my ruined jacket. I did not, however, hear her. \"Oh, my poor little hawthorns,\" I was assuring them through my sobs, \"it is not you that want to make me unhappy, to force me to leave you. You, you have never done me any harm. So I shall always love you.\" And, drying my eyes, I promised them that, when I grew up, I would never copy the foolish example of other men, but that even in Paris, on fine spring days, instead of paying calls and listening to silly talk, I would make excursions into the country to see the first hawthorn-trees in bloom.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once in the fields we never left them again during the rest of our M\u00e9s\u00e9glise walk. They were perpetually crossed, as though by invisible streams of traffic, by the wind, which was to me the tutelary genius of Combray. Every year, on the day of our arrival, in order to feel that I really was at Combray, I would climb the hill to find it running again through my clothing, and setting me running in its wake. One always had the wind for companion when one went the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way,' on that swelling plain which stretched, mile beyond mile, without any disturbance of its gentle contour. I knew that Mlle. Swann used often to go and spend a few days at Laon, and, for all that it was many miles away, the distance was obviated by the absence of any intervening obstacle; when, on hot afternoons, I would see a breath of wind emerge from the farthest horizon, bowing the heads of the corn in distant fields, pouring like a flood over all that vast expanse, and finally settling down, warm and rustling, among the clover and sainfoin at my feet, that plain which was common to us both seemed then to draw us together, to unite us; I would imagine that the same breath had passed by her also, that there was some message from her in what it was whispering to me, without my being able to understand it, and I would catch and kiss it as it passed. On my left was a village called Champieu (Campus Pagani, according to the Cur\u00e9). On my right I could see across the cornfields the two crocketed, rustic spires of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, themselves as tapering, scaly, plated, honeycombed, yellowed, and roughened as two ears of wheat.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At regular intervals, among the inimitable ornamentation of their leaves, which can be mistaken for those of no other fruit-tree, the apple-trees were exposing their broad petals of white satin, or hanging in shy bunches their unopened, blushing buds. It was while going the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' that I first noticed the circular shadow which apple-trees cast upon the sunlit ground, and also those impalpable threads of golden silk which the setting sun weaves slantingly downwards from beneath their leaves, and which I would see my father slash through with his stick without ever making them swerve from their straight path.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes in the afternoon sky a white moon would creep up like a little cloud, furtive, without display, suggesting an actress who does not have to 'come on' for a while, and so goes 'in front' in her ordinary clothes to watch the rest of the company for a moment, but keeps in the background, not wishing to attract attention to herself. I was glad to find her image reproduced in books and paintings, though these works of art were very different\u2014at least in my earlier years, before Bloch had attuned my eyes and mind to more subtle harmonies\u2014from those in which the moon seems fair to me to-day, but in which I should not have recognised her then. It might be, for instance, some novel by Saintine, some landscape by Gleyre, in which she is cut out sharply against the sky, in the form of a silver sickle, some work as unsophisticated and as incomplete as were, at that date, my own impressions, and which it enraged my grandmother's sisters to see me admire. They held that one ought to set before children, and that children shewed their own innate good taste in admiring, only such books and pictures as they would continue to admire when their minds were developed and mature. No doubt they regarded aesthetic values as material objects which an unclouded vision could not fail to discern, without needing to have their equivalent in experience of life stored up and slowly ripening in one's heart.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was along the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way,' at Montjouvain, a house built on the edge of a large pond, and overlooked by a steep, shrub-grown hill, that M. Vinteuil lived. And so we used often to meet his daughter driving her dogcart at full speed along the road. After a certain year we never saw her alone, but always accompanied by a friend, a girl older than herself, with an evil reputation in the neighbourhood, who in the end installed herself permanently, one day, at Montjouvain. People said: \"That poor M. Vinteuil must be blinded by love not to see what everyone is talking about, and to let his daughter\u2014a man who is horrified if you use a word in the wrong sense\u2014bring a woman like that to live under his roof. He says that she is a most superior woman, with a heart of gold, and that she would have shewn extraordinary musical talent if she had only been trained. He may be sure it is not music that she is teaching his daughter.\" But M. Vinteuil assured them that it was, and indeed it is remarkable that people never fail to arouse admiration of their normal qualities in the relatives of anyone with whom they are in physical intercourse. Bodily passion, which has been so unjustly decried, compels its victims to display every vestige that is in them of unselfishness and generosity, and so effectively that they shine resplendent in the eyes of all beholders. Dr. Percepied, whose loud voice and bushy eyebrows enabled him to play to his heart's content the part of 'double-dealer,' a part to which he was not, otherwise, adapted, without in the least degree compromising his unassailable and quite unmerited reputation of being a kind-hearted old curmudgeon, could make the Cur\u00e9 and everyone else laugh until they cried by saying in a harsh voice: \"What d'ye say to this, now? It seems that she plays music with her friend, Mile. Vinteuil. That surprises you, does it? Oh, I know nothing, nothing at all. It was Papa Vinteuil who told me all about it yesterday. After all, she has every right to be fond of music, that girl. I should never dream of thwarting the artistic vocation of a child; nor Vinteuil either, it seems. And then he plays music too, with his daughter's friend. Why, gracious heavens, it must be a regular musical box, that house out there! What are you laughing at? I say they've been playing too much music, those people. I met Papa Vinteuil the other day, by the cemetery. It was all he could do to keep on his feet.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anyone who, like ourselves, had seen M. Vinteuil, about this time, avoiding people whom he knew, and turning away as soon as he caught sight of them, changed in a few months into an old man, engulfed in a sea of sorrows, incapable of any effort not directly aimed at promoting his daughter's happiness, spending whole days beside his wife's grave, could hardly have failed to realise that he was gradually dying of a broken heart, could hardly have supposed that he paid no attention to the rumours which were going about. He knew, perhaps he even believed, what his neighbours were saying. There is probably no one, however rigid his virtue, who is not liable to find himself, by the complexity of circumstances, living at close quarters with the very vice which he himself has been most outspoken in condemning, without at first recognising it beneath the disguise which it assumes on entering his presence, so as to wound him and to make him suffer; the odd words, the unaccountable attitude, one evening, of a person whom he has a thousand reasons for loving. But for a man of M. Vinteuil's sensibility it must have been far more painful than for a hardened man of the world to have to resign himself to one of those situations which are wrongly supposed to occur in Bohemian circles only; for they are produced whenever there needs to establish itself in the security necessary to its development a vice which Nature herself has planted in the soul of a child, perhaps by no more than blending the virtues of its father and mother, as she might blend the colours of their eyes. And yet however much M. Vinteuil may have known of his daughter's conduct it did not follow that his adoration of her grew any less. The facts of life do not penetrate to the sphere in which our beliefs are cherished; as it was not they that engendered those beliefs, so they are powerless to destroy them; they can aim at them continual blows of contradiction and disproof without weakening them; and an avalanche of miseries and maladies coming, one after another, without interruption into the bosom of a family, will not make it lose faith in either the clemency of its God or the capacity of its physician. But when M. Vinteuil regarded his daughter and himself from the point of view of the world, and of their reputation, when he attempted to place himself by her side in the rank which they occupied in the general estimation of their neighbours, then he was bound to give judgment, to utter his own and her social condemnation in precisely the terms which the inhabitant of Combray most hostile to him and his daughter would have employed; he saw himself and her in 'low,' in the very 'lowest water,' inextricably stranded; and his manners had of late been tinged with that humility, that respect for persons who ranked above him and to whom he must now look up (however far beneath him they might hitherto have been), that tendency to search for some means of rising again to their level, which is an almost mechanical result of any human misfortune.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day, when we were walking with Swann in one of the streets of Combray, M. Vinteuil, turning out of another street, found himself so suddenly face to face with us all that he had not time to escape; and Swann, with that almost arrogant charity of a man of the world who, amid the dissolution of all his own moral prejudices, finds in another's shame merely a reason for treating him with a friendly benevolence, the outward signs of which serve to enhance and gratify the self-esteem of the bestower because he feels that they are all the more precious to him upon whom they are bestowed, conversed at great length with M. Vinteuil, with whom for a long time he had been barely on speaking terms, and invited him, before leaving us, to send his daughter over, one day, to play at Tansonville. It was an invitation which, two years earlier, would have enraged M. Vinteuil, but which now filled him with so much gratitude that he felt himself obliged to refrain from the indiscretion of accepting. Swann's friendly regard for his daughter seemed to him to be in itself so honourable, so precious a support for his cause that he felt it would perhaps be better to make no use of it, so as to have the wholly Platonic satisfaction of keeping it in reserve.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What a charming man!\" he said to us, after Swann had gone, with the same enthusiasm and veneration which make clever and pretty women of the middle classes fall victims to the physical and intellectual charms of a duchess, even though she be ugly and a fool. \"What a charming man! What a pity that he should have made such a deplorable marriage!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, so strong an element of hypocrisy is there in even the most sincere of men, who cast off, while they are talking to anyone, the opinion they actually hold of him and will express when he is no longer there, my family joined with M. Vinteuil in deploring Swann's marriage, invoking principles and conventions which (all the more because they invoked them in common with him, as though we were all thorough good fellows of the same sort) they appeared to suggest were in no way infringed at Montjouvain. M. Vinteuil did not send his daughter to visit Swann, an omission which Swann was the first to regret. For constantly, after meeting M. Vinteuil, he would remember that he had been meaning for a long time to ask him about some one of the same name as himself, one of his relatives, Swann supposed. And on this occasion he determined that he would not forget what he had to say to him when M. Vinteuil should appear with his daughter at Tansonville.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' was the shorter of the two that we used to take for our walks round Combray, and for that reason was reserved for days of uncertain weather, it followed that the climate of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise shewed an unduly high rainfall, and we would never lose sight of the fringe of Roussainville wood, so that we could, at any moment, run for shelter beneath its dense thatch of leaves.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often the sun would disappear behind a cloud, which impinged on its roundness, but whose edge the sun gilded in return. The brightness, though not the light of day, would then be shut off from a landscape in which all life appeared to be suspended, while the little village of Roussainville carved in relief upon the sky the white mass of its gables, with a startling precision of detail. A gust of wind blew from its perch a rook, which floated away and settled in the distance, while beneath a paling sky the woods on the horizon assumed a deeper tone of blue, as though they were painted in one of those cameos which you still find decorating the walls of old houses.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But on other days would begin to fall the rain, of which we had had due warning from the little barometer-figure which the spectacle-maker hung out in his doorway. Its drops, like migrating birds which fly off in a body at a given moment, would come down out of the sky in close marching order. They would never drift apart, would make no movement at random in their rapid course, but each one, keeping in its place, would draw after it the drop which was following, and the sky would be as greatly darkened as by the swallows flying south. We would take refuge among the trees. And when it seemed that their flight was accomplished, a few last drops, feebler and slower than the rest, would still come down. But we would emerge from our shelter, for the rain was playing a game, now, among the branches, and, even when it was almost dry again underfoot, a stray drop or two, lingering in the hollow of a leaf, would run down and hang glistening from the point of it until suddenly it splashed plump upon our upturned faces from the whole height of the tree.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often, too, we would hurry for shelter, tumbling in among all its stony saints and patriarchs, into the porch of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, How typically French that church was! Over its door the saints, the kings of chivalry with lilies in their hands, the wedding scenes and funerals were carved as they might have been in the mind of Fran\u00e7oise. The sculptor had also recorded certain anecdotes of Aristotle and Virgil, precisely as Fran\u00e7oise in her kitchen would break into speech about Saint Louis as though she herself had known him, generally in order to depreciate, by contrast with him, my grandparents, whom she considered less 'righteous.' One could see that the ideas which the mediaeval artist and the mediaeval peasant (who had survived to cook for us in the nineteenth century) had of classical and of early Christian history, ideas whose inaccuracy was atoned for by their honest simplicity, were derived not from books, but from a tradition at once ancient and direct, unbroken, oral, degraded, unrecognisable, and alive. Another Combray person whom I could discern also, potential and typified, in the gothic sculptures of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs was young Th\u00e9odore, the assistant in Camus's shop. And, indeed, Fran\u00e7oise herself was well aware that she had in him a countryman and contemporary, for when my aunt was too ill for Fran\u00e7oise to be able, unaided, to lift her in her bed or to carry her to her chair, rather than let the kitchen-maid come upstairs and, perhaps, 'make an impression' on my aunt, she would send out for Th\u00e9odore. And this lad, who was regarded, and quite rightly, in the town as a 'bad character,' was so abounding in that spirit which had served to decorate the porch of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, and particularly in the feelings of respect due, in Fran\u00e7oise eyes, to all 'poor invalids,' and, above all, to her own 'poor mistress,' that he had, when he bent down to raise my aunt's head from her pillow, the same air of pr\u00e9rapha\u00e9lite simplicity and zeal which the little angels in the bas-reliefs wear, who throng, with tapers in their hands, about the deathbed of Our Lady, as though those carved faces of stone, naked and grey like trees in winter, were, like them, asleep only, storing up life and waiting to flower again in countless plebeian faces, reverend and cunning as the face of Th\u00e9odore, and glowing with the ruddy brilliance of ripe apples.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There, too, not fastened to the wall like the little angels, but detached from the porch, of more than human stature, erect upon her pedestal as upon a footstool, which had been placed there to save her feet from contact with the wet ground, stood a saint with the full cheeks, the firm breasts which swelled out inside her draperies like a cluster of ripe grapes inside a bag, the narrow forehead, short and stubborn nose, deep-set eyes, and strong, thick-skinned, courageous expression of the country-women of those parts. This similarity, which imparted to the statue itself a kindliness that I had not looked to find in it, was corroborated often by the arrival of some girl from the fields, come, like ourselves, for shelter beneath the porch, whose presence there\u2014as when the leaves of a climbing plant have grown up beside leaves carved in stone\u2014seemed intended by fate to allow us, by confronting it with its type in nature, to form a critical estimate of the truth of the work of art. Before our eyes, in the distance, a promised or an accursed land, Roussainville, within whose walls I had never penetrated, Roussainville was now, when the rain had ceased for us, still being chastised, like a village in the Old Testament, by all the innumerable spears and arrows of the storm, which beat down obliquely upon the dwellings of its inhabitants, or else had already received the forgiveness of the Almighty, Who had restored to it the light of His sun, which fell upon it in rays of uneven length, like the rays of a monstrance upon an altar.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, when the weather had completely broken, we were obliged to go home and to remain shut up indoors. Here and there, in the distance, in a landscape which, what with the failing light and saturated atmosphere, resembled a seascape rather, a few solitary houses clinging to the lower slopes of a hill whose heights were buried in a cloudy darkness shone out like little boats which had folded their sails and would ride at anchor, all night, upon the sea. But what mattered rain or storm? In summer, bad weather is no more than a passing fit of superficial ill-temper expressed by the permanent, underlying fine weather; a very different thing from the fluid and unstable 'fine weather' of winter, its very opposite, in fact; for has it not (firmly established in the soil, on which it has taken solid form in dense masses of foliage over which the rain may pour in torrents without weakening the resistance offered by their real and lasting happiness) hoisted, to keep them flying throughout the season, in the village streets, on the walls of the houses and in their gardens, its silken banners, violet and white. Sitting in the little parlour, where I would pass the time until dinner with a book, I might hear the water dripping from our chestnut-trees, but I would know that the shower would only glaze and brighten the greenness of their thick, crumpled leaves, and that they themselves had undertaken to remain there, like pledges of summer, all through the rainy night, to assure me of the fine weather's continuing; it might rain as it pleased, but to-morrow, over the white fence of Tansonville, there would surge and flow, numerous as ever, a sea of little heart-shaped leaves; and without the least anxiety I could watch the poplar in the Rue des Perchamps praying for mercy, bowing in desperation before the storm; without the least anxiety I could hear, at the far end of the garden, the last peals of thunder growling among our lilac-trees.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the weather was bad all morning, my family would abandon the idea of a walk, and I would remain at home. But, later on, I formed the habit of going out by myself on such days, and walking towards M\u00e9s\u00e9glise-la-Vineuse, during that autumn when we had to come to Combray to settle the division of my aunt L\u00e9onie's estate; for she had died at last, leaving both parties among her neighbours triumphant in the fact of her demise\u2014those who had insisted that her mode of life was enfeebling and must ultimately kill her, and, equally, those who had always maintained that she suffered from some disease not imaginary, but organic, by the visible proof of which the most sceptical would be obliged to own themselves convinced, once she had succumbed to it; causing no intense grief to any save one of her survivors, but to that one a grief savage in its violence. During the long fortnight of my aunt's last illness Fran\u00e7oise never went out of her room for an instant, never took off her clothes, allowed no one else to do anything for my aunt, and did not leave her body until it was actually in its grave. Then, at last, we understood that the sort of terror in which Fran\u00e7oise had lived of my aunt's harsh words, her suspicions and her anger, had developed in her a sentiment which we had mistaken for hatred, and which was really veneration and love. Her true mistress, whose decisions it had been impossible to foresee, from whose stratagems it had been so hard to escape, of whose good nature it had been so easy to take advantage, her sovereign, her mysterious and omnipotent monarch was no more. Compared with such a mistress we counted for very little. The time had long passed when, on our first coming to spend our holidays at Combray, we had been of equal importance, in Fran\u00e7oise eyes, with my aunt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During that autumn my parents, finding the days so fully occupied with the legal formalities that had to be gone through, and discussions with solicitors and farmers, that they had little time for walks which, as it happened, the weather made precarious, began to let me go, without them, along the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way,' wrapped up in a huge Highland plaid which protected me from the rain, and which I was all the more ready to throw over my shoulders because I felt that the stripes of its gaudy tartan scandalised Fran\u00e7oise, whom it was impossible to convince that the colour of one's clothes had nothing whatever to do with one's mourning for the dead, and to whom the grief which we had shewn on my aunt's death was wholly unsatisfactory, since we had not entertained the neighbours to a great funeral banquet, and did not adopt a special tone when we spoke of her, while I at times might be heard humming a tune. I am sure that in a book\u2014and to that extent my feelings were closely akin to those of Fran\u00e7oise\u2014such a conception of mourning, in the manner of the Chanson de Roland and of the porch of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, would have seemed most attractive. But the moment that Fran\u00e7oise herself approached, some evil spirit would urge me to attempt to make her angry, and I would avail myself of the slightest pretext to say to her that I regretted my aunt's death because she had been a good woman in spite of her absurdities, but not in the least because she was my aunt; that she might easily have been my aunt and yet have been so odious that her death would not have caused me a moment's sorrow; statements which, in a book, would have struck me as merely fatuous.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if Fran\u00e7oise then, inspired like a poet with a flood of confused reflections upon bereavement, grief, and family memories, were to plead her inability to rebut my theories, saying: \"I don't know how to espress myself\"\u2014I would triumph over her with an ironical and brutal common sense worthy of Dr. Percepied; and if she went on: \"All the same she was a geological relation; there is always the respect due to your geology,\" I would shrug my shoulders and say: \"It is really very good of me to discuss the matter with an illiterate old woman who cannot speak her own language,\" adopting, to deliver judgment on Fran\u00e7oise, the mean and narrow outlook of the pedant, whom those who are most contemptuous of him in the impartiality of their own minds are only too prone to copy when they are obliged to play a part upon the vulgar stage of life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My walks, that autumn, were all the more delightful because I used to take them after long hours spent over a book. When I was tired of reading, after a whole morning in the house, I would throw my plaid across my shoulders and set out; my body, which in a long spell of enforced immobility had stored up an accumulation of vital energy, was now obliged, like a spinning-top wound and let go, to spend this in every direction. The walls of houses, the Tansonville hedge, the trees of Roussainville wood, the bushes against which Montjouvain leaned its back, all must bear the blows of my walking-stick or umbrella, must hear my shouts of happiness, blows and shouts being indeed no more than expressions of the confused ideas which exhilarated me, and which, not being developed to the point at which they might rest exposed to the light of day, rather than submit to a slow and difficult course of elucidation, found it easier and more pleasant to drift into an immediate outlet. And so it is that the bulk of what appear to be the emotional renderings of our inmost sensations do no more than relieve us of the burden of those sensations by allowing them to escape from us in an indistinct form which does not teach us how it should be interpreted. When I attempt to reckon up all that I owe to the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way,' all the humble discoveries of which it was either the accidental setting or the direct inspiration and cause, I am reminded that it was in that same autumn, on one of those walks, near the bushy precipice which guarded Montjouvain from the rear, that I was struck for the first time by this lack of harmony between our impressions and their normal forms of expression. After an hour of rain and wind, against which I had put up a brisk fight, as I came to the edge of the Montjouvain pond, and reached a little hut, roofed with tiles, in which M. Vinteuil's gardener kept his tools, the sun shone out again, and its golden rays, washed clean by the shower, blazed once more in the sky, on the trees, on the wall of the hut, and on the still wet tiles of the roof, which had a chicken perching upon its ridge. The wind pulled out sideways the wild grass that grew in the wall, and the chicken's downy feathers, both of which things let themselves float upon the wind's breath to their full extent, with the unresisting submissiveness of light and lifeless matter. The tiled roof cast upon the pond, whose reflections were now clear again in the sunlight, a square of pink marble, the like of which I had never observed before. And, seeing upon the water, where it reflected the wall, a pallid smile responding to the smiling sky, I cried aloud in my enthusiasm, brandishing my furled umbrella: \"Damn, damn, damn, damn!\" But at the same time I felt that I was in duty bound not to content myself with these unilluminating words, but to endeavour to see more clearly into the sources of my enjoyment.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it was at that moment, too\u2014thanks to a peasant who went past, apparently in a bad enough humour already, but more so when he nearly received my umbrella in his face, and who replied without any cordiality to my \"Fine day, what! good to be out walking!\"\u2014that I learned that identical emotions do not spring up in the hearts of all men simultaneously, by a pre-established order. Later on I discovered that, whenever I had read for too long and was in a mood for conversation, the friend to whom I would be burning to say something would at that moment have finished indulging himself in the delights of conversation, and wanted nothing now but to be left to read undisturbed. And if I had been thinking with affection of my parents, and forming the most sensible and proper plans for giving them pleasure, they would have been using the same interval of time to discover some misdeed that I had already forgotten, and would begin to scold me severely, just as I flung myself upon them with a kiss.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes to the exhilaration which I derived from being alone would be added an alternative feeling, so that I could not be clear in my mind to which I should give the casting vote; a feeling stimulated by the desire to see rise up before my eyes a peasant-girl whom I might clasp in my arms. Coming abruptly, and without giving me time to trace it accurately to its source among so many ideas of a very different kind, the pleasure which accompanied this desire seemed only a degree superior to what was given me by my other thoughts. I found an additional merit in everything that was in my mind at the moment, in the pink reflection of the tiled roof, the wild grass in the wall, the village of Roussainville into which I had long desired to penetrate, the trees of its wood and the steeple of its church, created in them by this fresh emotion which made them appear more desirable only because I thought it was they that had provoked it, and which seemed only to wish to bear me more swiftly towards them when it filled my sails with a potent, unknown, and propitious breeze. But if this desire that a woman should appear added for me something more exalting than the charms of nature, they in their turn enlarged what I might, in the woman's charm, have found too much restricted. It seemed to me that the beauty of the trees was hers also, and that, as for the spirit of those horizons, of the village of Roussainville, of the books which I was reading that year, it was her kiss which would make me master of them all; and, my imagination drawing strength from contact with my sensuality, my sensuality expanding through all the realms of my imagination, my desire had no longer any bounds. Moreover\u2014just as in moments of musing contemplation of nature, the normal actions of the mind being suspended, and our abstract ideas of things set on one side, we believe with the profoundest faith in the originality, in the individual existence of the place in which we may happen to be\u2014the passing figure which my desire evoked seemed to be not any one example of the general type of 'woman,' but a necessary and natural product of the soil. For at that time everything which was not myself, the earth and the creatures upon it, seemed to me more precious, more important, endowed with a more real existence than they appear to full-grown men. And between the earth and its creatures I made no distinction. I had a desire for a peasant-girl from M\u00e9s\u00e9glise or Roussainville, for a fisher-girl from Balbec, just as I had a desire for Balbec and M\u00e9s\u00e9glise. The pleasure which those girls were empowered to give me would have seemed less genuine, I should have had no faith in it any longer, if I had been at liberty to modify its conditions as I chose. To meet in Paris a fisher-girl from Balbec or a peasant-girl from M\u00e9s\u00e9glise would have been like receiving the present of a shell which I had never seen upon the beach, or of a fern which I had never found among the woods, would have stripped from the pleasure which she was about to give me all those other pleasures in the thick of which my imagination had enwrapped her. But to wander thus among the woods of Roussainville without a peasant-girl to embrace was to see those woods and yet know nothing of their secret treasure, their deep-hidden beauty. That girl whom I never saw save dappled with the shadows of their leaves, was to me herself a plant of local growth, only taller than the rest, and one whose structure would enable me to approach more closely than in them to the intimate savour of the land from which she had sprung. I could believe this all the more readily (and also that the caresses by which she would bring that savour to my senses were themselves of a particular kind, yielding a pleasure which I could never derive from any but herself) since I was still, and must for long remain, in that period of life when one has not yet separated the fact of this sensual pleasure from the various women in whose company one has tasted it, when one has not reduced it to a general idea which makes one regard them thenceforward as the variable instruments of a pleasure that is always the same. Indeed, that pleasure does not exist, isolated and formulated in the consciousness, as the ultimate object with which one seeks a woman's company, or as the cause of the uneasiness which, in anticipation, one then feels. Hardly even does one think of oneself, but only how to escape from oneself. Obscurely awaited, immanent and concealed, it rouses to such a paroxysm, at the moment when at last it makes itself felt, those other pleasures which we find in the tender glance, in the kiss of her who is by our side, that it seems to us, more than anything else, a sort of transport of gratitude for the kindness of heart of our companion and for her touching predilection of ourselves, which we measure by the benefits, by the happiness that she showers upon us.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas, it was in vain that I implored the dungeon-keep of Roussainville, that I begged it to send out to meet me some daughter of its village, appealing to it as to the sole confidant to whom I had disclosed my earliest desire when, from the top floor of our house at Combray, from the little room that smelt of orris-root, I had peered out and seen nothing but its tower, framed in the square of the half-opened window, while, with the heroic scruples of a traveller setting forth for unknown climes, or of a desperate wretch hesitating on the verge of self-destruction, faint with emotion, I explored, across the bounds of my own experience, an untrodden path which, I believed, might lead me to my death, even\u2014until passion spent itself and left me shuddering among the sprays of flowering currant which, creeping in through the window, tumbled all about my body. In vain I called upon it now. In vain I compressed the whole landscape into my field of vision, draining it with an exhaustive gaze which sought to extract from it a female creature. I might go alone as far as the porch of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs: never did I find there the girl whom I should inevitably have met, had I been with my grandfather, and so unable to engage her in conversation. I would fix my eyes, without limit of time, upon the trunk of a distant tree, from behind which she must appear and spring towards me; my closest scrutiny left the horizon barren as before; night was falling; without any hope now would I concentrate my attention, as though to force up out of it the creatures which it must conceal, upon that sterile soil, that stale and outworn land; and it was no longer in lightness of heart, but with sullen anger that I aimed blows at the trees of Roussainville wood, from among which no more living creatures made their appearance than if they had been trees painted on the stretched canvas background of a panorama, when, unable to resign myself to having to return home without having held in my arms the woman I so greatly desired, I was yet obliged to retrace my steps towards Combray, and to admit to myself that the chance of her appearing in my path grew smaller every moment. And if she had appeared, would I have dared to speak to her? I felt that she would have regarded me as mad, for I no longer thought of those desires which came to me on my walks, but were never realized, as being shared by others, or as having any existence apart from myself. They seemed nothing more now than the purely subjective, impotent, illusory creatures of my temperament. They were in no way connected now with nature, with the world of real things, which from now onwards lost all its charm and significance, and meant no more to my life than a purely conventional framework, just as the action of a novel is framed in the railway carriage, on a seat of which a traveller is reading it to pass the time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it is perhaps from another impression which I received at Mont-jouvain, some years later, an impression which at that time was without meaning, that there arose, long afterwards, my idea of that cruel side of human passion called 'sadism.' We shall see, in due course, that for quite another reason the memory of this impression was to play an important part in my life. It was during a spell of very hot weather; my parents, who had been obliged to go away for the whole day, had told me that I might stay out as late as I pleased; and having gone as far as the Montjouvain pond, where I enjoyed seeing again the reflection of the tiled roof of the hut, I had lain down in the shade and gone to sleep among the bushes on the steep slope that rose up behind the house, just where I had waited for my parents, years before, one day when they had gone to call on M. Vinteuil. It was almost dark when I awoke, and I wished to rise and go away, but I saw Mile. Vinteuil (or thought, at least, that I recognised her, for I had not seen her often at Combray, and then only when she was still a child, whereas she was now growing into a young woman), who probably had just come in, standing in front of me, and only a few feet away from me, in that room in which her father had entertained mine, and which she had now made into a little sitting-room for herself. The window was partly open; the lamp was lighted; I could watch her every movement without her being able to see me; but, had I gone away, I must have made a rustling sound among the bushes, she would have heard me, and might have thought that I had been hiding there in order to spy upon her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was in deep mourning, for her father had but lately died. We had not gone to see her; my mother had not cared to go, on account of that virtue which alone in her fixed any bounds to her benevolence\u2014namely, modesty; but she pitied the girl from the depths of her heart. My mother had not forgotten the sad end of M. Vinteuil's life, his complete absorption, first in having to play both mother and nursery-maid to his daughter, and, later, in the suffering which she had caused him; she could see the tortured expression which was never absent from the old man's face in those terrible last years; she knew that he had definitely abandoned the task of transcribing in fair copies the whole of his later work, the poor little pieces, we imagined, of an old music-master, a retired village organist, which, we assumed, were of little or no value in themselves, though we did not despise them, because they were of such great value to him and had been the chief motive of his life before he sacrificed them to his daughter; pieces which, being mostly not even written down, but recorded only in his memory, while the rest were scribbled on loose sheets of paper, and quite illegible, must now remain unknown for ever; my mother thought, also, of that other and still more cruel renunciation to which M. Vinteuil had been driven, that of seeing the girl happily settled, with an honest and respectable future; when she called to mind all this utter and crushing misery that had come upon my aunts' old music-master, she was moved to very real grief, and shuddered to think of that other grief, so different in its bitterness, which Mlle. Vinteuil must now be feeling, tinged with remorse at having virtually killed her father. \"Poor M. Vinteuil,\" my mother would say, \"he lived for his daughter, and now he has died for her, without getting his reward. Will he get it now, I wonder, and in what form? It can only come to him from her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the far end of Mlle. Vinteuil's sitting-room, on the mantelpiece, stood a small photograph of her father which she went briskly to fetch, just as the sound of carriage wheels was heard from the road outside, then flung herself down on a sofa and drew close beside her a little table on which she placed the photograph, just as, long ago, M. Vinteuil had 'placed' beside him the piece of music which he would have liked to play over to my parents. And then her friend came in. Mlle. Vinteuil greeted her without rising, clasping her hands behind her head, and drew her body to one side of the sofa, as though to 'make room.' But no sooner had she done this than she appeared to feel that she was perhaps suggesting a particular position to her friend, with an emphasis which might well be regarded as importunate. She thought that her friend would prefer, no doubt, to sit down at some distance from her, upon a chair; she felt that she had been indiscreet; her sensitive heart took fright; stretching herself out again over the whole of the sofa, she closed her eyes and began to yawn, so as to indicate that it was a desire to sleep, and that alone, which had made her lie down there. Despite the rude and hectoring familiarity with which she treated her companion I could recognise in her the obsequious and reticent advances, the abrupt scruples and restraints which had characterised her father. Presently she rose and came to the window, where she pretended to be trying to close the shutters and not succeeding.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Leave them open,\" said her friend. \"I am hot.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But it's too dreadful! People will see us,\" Mlle. Vinteuil answered. And then she guessed, probably, that her friend would think that she had uttered these words simply in order to provoke a reply in certain other words, which she seemed, indeed, to wish to hear spoken, but, from prudence, would let her friend be the first to speak. And so, although I could not see her face clearly enough, I am sure that the expression must have appeared on it which my grandmother had once found so delightful, when she hastily went on: \"When I say 'see us' I mean, of course, see us reading. It's so dreadful to think that in every trivial little thing you do some one may be overlooking you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the instinctive generosity of her nature, a courtesy beyond her control, she refrained from uttering the studied words which, she had felt, were indispensable for the full realisation of her desire. And perpetually, in the depths of her being, a shy and suppliant maiden would kneel before that other element, the old campaigner, battered but triumphant, would intercede with him and oblige him to retire.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, yes, it is so extremely likely that people are looking at us at this time of night in this densely populated district!\" said her friend, with bitter irony. \"And what if they are?\" she went on, feeling bound to annotate with a malicious yet affectionate wink these words which she was repeating, out of good nature, like a lesson prepared beforehand which, she knew, it would please Mlle. Vinteuil to hear. \"And what if they are? All the better that they should see us.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mlle. Vinteuil shuddered and rose to her feet. In her sensitive and scrupulous heart she was ignorant what words ought to flow, spontaneously, from her lips, so as to produce the scene for which her eager senses clamoured. She reached out as far as she could across the limitations of her true character to find the language appropriate to a vicious young woman such as she longed to be thought, but the words which, she imagined, such a young woman might have uttered with sincerity sounded unreal in her own mouth. And what little she allowed herself to say was said in a strained tone, in which her ingrained timidity paralysed her tendency to freedom and audacity of speech; while she kept on interrupting herself with: \"You're sure you aren't cold? You aren't too hot? You don't want to sit and read by yourself?...\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Your ladyship's thoughts seem to be rather 'warm' this evening,\" she concluded, doubtless repeating a phrase which she had heard used, on some earlier occasion, by her friend.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the V-shaped opening of her crape bodice Mlle. Vinteuil felt the sting of her friend's sudden kiss; she gave a little scream and ran away; and then they began to chase one another about the room, scrambling over the furniture, their wide sleeves fluttering like wings, clucking and crowing like a pair of amorous fowls. At last Mlle. Vinteuil fell down exhausted upon the sofa, where she was screened from me by the stooping body of her friend. But the latter now had her back turned to the little table on which the old music-master's portrait had been arranged. Mlle. Vinteuil realised that her friend would not see it unless her attention were drawn to it, and so exclaimed, as if she herself had just noticed it for the first time: \"Oh! there's my father's picture looking at us; I can't think who can have put it there; I'm sure I've told them twenty times, that is not the proper place for it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I remembered the words that M. Vinteuil had used to my parents in apologising for an obtrusive sheet of music. This photograph was, of course, in common use in their ritual observances, was subjected to daily profanation, for the friend replied in words which were evidently a liturgical response: \"Let him stay there. He can't trouble us any longer. D'you think he'd start whining, d'you think he'd pack you out of the house if he could see you now, with the window open, the ugly old monkey?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To which Mlle. Vinteuil replied, \"Oh, please!\"\u2014a gentle reproach which testified to the genuine goodness of her nature, not that it was prompted by any resentment at hearing her father spoken of in this fashion (for that was evidently a feeling which she had trained herself, by a long course of sophistries, to keep in close subjection at such moments), but rather because it was the bridle which, so as to avoid all appearance of egotism, she herself used to curb the gratification which her friend was attempting to procure for her. It may well have been, too, that the smiling moderation with which she faced and answered these blasphemies, that this tender and hypocritical rebuke appeared to her frank and generous nature as a particularly shameful and seductive form of that criminal attitude towards life which she was endeavouring to adopt. But she could not resist the attraction of being treated with affection by a woman who had just shewn herself so implacable towards the defenceless dead; she sprang on to the knees of her friend and held out a chaste brow to be kissed; precisely as a daughter would have done to her mother, feeling with exquisite joy that they would thus, between them, inflict the last turn of the screw of cruelty, in robbing M. Vinteuil, as though they were actually rifling his tomb, of the sacred rights of fatherhood. Her friend took the girl's head in her hands and placed a kiss on her brow with a docility prompted by the real affection she had for Mlle. Vinteuil, as well as by the desire to bring what distraction she could into the dull and melancholy life of an orphan.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you know what I should like to do to that old horror?\" she said, taking up the photograph. She murmured in Mlle. Vinteuil's ear something that I could not distinguish.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh! You would never dare.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Not dare to spit on it? On that?\" shouted the friend with deliberate brutality.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I heard no more, for Mlle. Vinteuil, who now seemed weary, awkward, preoccupied, sincere, and rather sad, came back to the window and drew the shutters close; but I knew now what was the reward that M. Vinteuil, in return for all the suffering that he had endured in his lifetime, on account of his daughter, had received from her after his death.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet I have since reflected that if M. Vinteuil had been able to be present at this scene, he might still, and in spite of everything, have continued to believe in his daughter's soundness of heart, and that he might even, in so doing, have been not altogether wrong. It was true that in all Mlle. Vinteuil's actions the appearance of evil was so strong and so consistent that it would have been hard to find it exhibited in such completeness save in what is nowadays called a 'sadist'; it is behind the footlights of a Paris theatre, and not under the homely lamp of an actual country house, that one expects to see a girl leading her friend on to spit upon the portrait of a father who has lived and died for nothing and no one but herself; and when we find in real life a desire for melodramatic effect, it is generally the 'sadic' instinct that is responsible for it. It is possible that, without being in the least inclined towards 'sadism,' a girl might have shewn the same outrageous cruelty as Mlle. Vinteuil in desecrating the memory and defying the wishes of her dead father, but she would not have given them deliberate expression in an act so crude in its symbolism, so lacking in subtlety; the criminal element in her behaviour would have been less evident to other people, and even to herself, since she would not have admitted to herself that she was doing wrong. But, appearances apart, in Mlle. Vinteuil's soul, at least in the earlier stages, the evil element was probably not unmixed. A 'sadist' of her kind is an artist in evil, which a wholly wicked person could not be, for in that case the evil would not have been external, it would have seemed quite natural to her, and would not even have been distinguishable from herself; and as for virtue, respect for the dead, filial obedience, since she would never have practised the cult of these things, she would take no impious delight in their profanation. 'Sadists' of Mlle. Vinteuil's sort are creatures so purely sentimental, so virtuous by nature, that even sensual pleasure appears to them as something bad, a privilege reserved for the wicked. And when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it they endeavour to impersonate, to assume all the outward appearance of wicked people, for themselves and their partners in guilt, so as to gain the momentary illusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own gentle and scrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleasure. And I could understand how she must have longed for such an escape when I realised that it was impossible for her to effect it. At the moment when she wished to be thought the very antithesis of her father, what she at once suggested to me were the mannerisms, in thought and speech, of the poor old music-master. Indeed, his photograph was nothing; what she really desecrated, what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures, but what remained between them and her and prevented her from any direct enjoyment of them, was the likeness between her face and his, his mother's blue eyes which he had handed down to her, like some trinket to be kept in the family, those little friendly movements and inclinations which set up between the viciousness of Mlle. Vinteuil and herself a phraseology, a mentality not designed for vice, which made her regard it as not in any way different from the numberless little social duties and courtesies to which she must devote herself every day. It was not evil that gave her the idea of pleasure, that seemed to her attractive; it was pleasure, rather, that seemed evil. And as, every time that she indulged in it, pleasure came to her attended by evil thoughts such as, ordinarily, had no place in her virtuous mind, she came at length to see in pleasure itself something diabolical, to identify it with Evil. Perhaps Mlle. Vinteuil felt that at heart her friend was not altogether bad, not really sincere when she gave vent to those blasphemous utterances. At any rate, she had the pleasure of receiving those kisses on her brow, those smiles, those glances; all feigned, perhaps, but akin in their base and vicious mode of expression to those which would have been discernible on the face of a creature formed not out of kindness and long-suffering, but out of self-indulgence and cruelty. She was able to delude herself for a moment into believing that she was indeed amusing herself in the way in which, with so unnatural an accomplice, a girl might amuse herself who really did experience that savage antipathy towards her father's memory. Perhaps she would not have thought of wickedness as a state so rare, so abnormal, so exotic, one which it was so refreshing to visit, had she been able to distinguish in herself, as in all her fellow-men and women, that indifference to the sufferings which they cause which, whatever names else be given it, is the one true, terrible and lasting form of cruelty.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_______________________________________\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' was so easy, it was a very different matter when we took the 'Guermantes way,' for that meant a long walk, and we must make sure, first, of the weather. When we seemed to have entered upon a spell of fine days, when Fran\u00e7oise, in desperation that not a drop was falling upon the 'poor crops,' gazing up at the sky and seeing there only a little white cloud floating here and there upon its calm, azure surface, groaned aloud and exclaimed: \"You would say they were nothing more nor less than a lot of dogfish swimming about and sticking up their snouts! Ah, they never think of making it rain a little for the poor labourers! And then when the corn is all ripe, down it will come, rattling all over the place, and think no more of where it is falling than if it was on the sea!\"\u2014when my father's appeals to the gardener had met with the same encouraging answer several times in succession, then some one would say, at dinner: \"To-morrow, if the weather holds, we might go the Guermantes way.\" And off we would set, immediately after luncheon, through the little garden gate which dropped us into the Rue des Perchamps, narrow and bent at a sharp angle, dotted with grass-plots over which two or three wasps would spend the day botanising, a street as quaint as its name, from which its odd characteristics and its personality were, I felt, derived; a street for which one might search in vain through the Combray of to-day, for the public school now rises upon its site. But in my dreams of Combray (like those architects, pupils of Viollet-le-Duc, who, fancying that they can detect, beneath a Renaissance rood-loft and an eighteenth-century altar, traces of a Norman choir, restore the whole church to the state in which it probably was in the twelfth century) I leave not a stone of the modern edifice standing, I pierce through it and 'restore' the Rue des Perchamps. And for such reconstruction memory furnishes me with more detailed guidance than is generally at the disposal of restorers; the pictures which it has preserved\u2014perhaps the last surviving in the world to-day, and soon to follow the rest into oblivion\u2014of what Combray looked like in my childhood's days; pictures which, simply because it was the old Combray that traced their outlines upon my mind before it vanished, are as moving\u2014if I may compare a humble landscape with those glorious works, reproductions of which my grandmother was so fond of bestowing on me\u2014as those old engravings of the 'Cenacolo,' or that painting by Gentile Bellini, in which one sees, in a state in which they no longer exist, the masterpiece of Leonardo and the portico of Saint Mark's.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We would pass, in the Rue de l'Oiseau, before the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesch\u00e9, into whose great courtyard, once upon a time, would rumble the coaches of the Duchesses de Montpensier, de Guermantes, and de Montmorency, when they had to come down to Combray for some litigation with their farmers, or to receive homage from them. We would come at length to the Mall, among whose treetops I could distinguish the steeple of Saint-Hilaire. And I should have liked to be able to sit down and spend the whole day there, reading and listening to the bells, for it was so charming there and so quiet that, when an hour struck, you would have said not that it broke in upon the calm of the day, but that it relieved the day of its superfluity, and that the steeple, with the indolent, painstaking exactitude of a person who has nothing else to do, had simply, in order to squeeze out and let fall the few golden drops which had slowly and naturally accumulated in the hot sunlight, pressed, at a given moment, the distended surface of the silence.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The great charm of the 'Guermantes' way was that we had beside us, almost all the time, the course of the Vivonne. We crossed it first, ten minutes after leaving the house, by a foot-bridge called the Pont-Vieux. And every year, when we arrived at Combray, on Easter morning, after the sermon, if the weather was fine, I would run there to see (amid all the disorder that prevails on the morning of a great festival, the gorgeous preparations for which make the everyday household utensils that they have not contrived to banish seem more sordid than ever) the river flowing past, sky-blue already between banks still black and bare, its only companions a clump of daffodils, come out before their time, a few primroses, the first in flower, while here and there burned the blue flame of a violet, its stem bent beneath the weight of the drop of perfume stored in its tiny horn. The Pont-Vieux led to a tow-path which, at this point, would be overhung in summer by the bluish foliage of a hazel, under which a fisherman in a straw hat seemed to have taken root. At Combray, where I knew everyone, and could always detect the blacksmith or grocer's boy through his disguise of a beadle's uniform or chorister's surplice, this fisherman was the only person whom I was never able to identify. He must have known my family, for he used to raise his hat when we passed; and then I would always be just on the point of asking his name, when some one would make a sign to me to be quiet, or I would frighten the fish. We would follow the tow-path which ran along the top of a steep bank, several feet above the stream. The ground on the other side was lower, and stretched in a series of broad meadows as far as the village and even to the distant railway-station. Over these were strewn the remains, half-buried in the long grass, of the castle of the old Counts of Combray, who, during the Middle Ages, had had on this side the course of the Vivonne as a barrier and defence against attack from the Lords of Guermantes and Abbots of Martinville. Nothing was left now but a few stumps of towers, hummocks upon the broad surface of the fields, hardly visible, broken battlements over which, in their day, the bowmen had hurled down stones, the watchmen had gazed out over Novepont, Clairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-l'Exempt, fiefs all of them of Guermantes, a ring in which Combray was locked; but fallen among the grass now, levelled with the ground, climbed and commanded by boys from the Christian Brothers' school, who came there in their playtime, or with lesson-books to be conned; emblems of a past that had sunk down and well-nigh vanished under the earth, that lay by the water's edge now, like an idler taking the air, yet giving me strong food for thought, making the name of Combray connote to me not the little town of to-day only, but an historic city vastly different, seizing and holding my imagination by the remote, incomprehensible features which it half-concealed beneath a spangled veil of buttercups. For the buttercups grew past numbering on this spot which they had chosen for their games among the grass, standing singly, in couples, in whole companies, yellow as the yolk of eggs, and glowing with an added lustre, I felt, because, being powerless to consummate with my palate the pleasure which the sight of them never failed to give me, I would let it accumulate as my eyes ranged over their gilded expanse, until it had acquired the strength to create in my mind a fresh example of absolute, unproductive beauty; and so it had been from my earliest childhood, when from the tow-path I had stretched out my arms towards them, before even I could pronounce their charming name\u2014a name fit for the Prince in some French fairy-tale; colonists, perhaps, in some far distant century from Asia, but naturalised now for ever in the village, well satisfied with their modest horizon, rejoicing in the sunshine and the water's edge, faithful to their little glimpse of the railway-station; yet keeping, none the less, as do some of our old paintings, in their plebeian simplicity, a poetic scintillation from the golden East.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would amuse myself by watching the glass jars which the boys used to lower into the Vivonne, to catch minnows, and which, filled by the current of the stream, in which they themselves also were enclosed, at once 'containers' whose transparent sides were like solidified water and 'contents' plunged into a still larger container of liquid, flowing crystal, suggested an image of coolness more delicious and more provoking than the same water in the same jars would have done, standing upon a table laid for dinner, by shewing it as perpetually in flight between the impalpable water, in which my hands could not arrest it, and the insoluble glass, in which my palate could not enjoy it. I decided that I would come there again with a line and catch fish; I begged for and obtained a morsel of bread from our luncheon basket; and threw into the Vivonne pellets which had the power, it seemed, to bring about a chemical precipitation, for the water at once grew solid round about them in oval clusters of emaciated tadpoles, which until then it had, no doubt, been holding in solution, invisible, but ready and alert to enter the stage of crystallisation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently the course of the Vivonne became choked with water-plants. At first they appeared singly, a lily, for instance, which the current, across whose path it had unfortunately grown, would never leave at rest for a moment, so that, like a ferry-boat mechanically propelled, it would drift over to one bank only to return to the other, eternally repeating its double journey. Thrust towards the bank, its stalk would be straightened out, lengthened, strained almost to breaking-point until the current again caught it, its green moorings swung back over their anchorage and brought the unhappy plant to what might fitly be called its starting-point, since it was fated not to rest there a moment before moving off once again. I would still find it there, on one walk after another, always in the same helpless state, suggesting certain victims of neurasthenia, among whom my grandfather would have included my aunt L\u00e9onie, who present without modification, year after year, the spectacle of their odd and unaccountable habits, which they always imagine themselves to be on the point of shaking off, but which they always retain to the end; caught in the treadmill of their own maladies and eccentricities, their futile endeavours to escape serve only to actuate its mechanism, to keep in motion the clockwork of their strange, ineluctable, fatal daily round. Such as these was the water-lily, and also like one of those wretches whose peculiar torments, repeated indefinitely throughout eternity, aroused the curiosity of Dante, who would have inquired of them at greater length and in fuller detail from the victims themselves, had not Virgil, striding on ahead, obliged him to hasten after him at full speed, as I must hasten after my parents.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But farther on the current slackened, where the stream ran through a property thrown open to the public by its owner, who had made a hobby of aquatic gardening, so that the little ponds into which the Vivonne was here diverted were aflower with water-lilies. As the banks at this point were thickly wooded, the heavy shade of the trees gave the water a background which was ordinarily dark green, although sometimes, when we were coming home on a calm evening after a stormy afternoon, I have seen in its depths a clear, crude blue that was almost violet, suggesting a floor of Japanese cloisonn\u00e9. Here and there, on the surface, floated, blushing like a strawberry, the scarlet heart of a lily set in a ring of white petals.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beyond these the flowers were more frequent, but paler, less glossy, more thickly seeded, more tightly folded, and disposed, by accident, in festoons so graceful that I would fancy I saw floating upon the stream, as though after the dreary stripping of the decorations used in some Watteau festival, moss-roses in loosened garlands. Elsewhere a corner seemed to be reserved for the commoner kinds of lily; of a neat pink or white like rocket-flowers, washed clean like porcelain, with housewifely care; while, a little farther again, were others, pressed close together in a floating garden-bed, as though pansies had flown out of a garden like butterflies and were hovering with blue and burnished wings over the transparent shadowiness of this watery border; this skiey border also, for it set beneath the flowers a soil of a colour more precious, more moving than their own; and both in the afternoon, when it sparkled beneath the lilies in the kaleidoscope of a happiness silent, restless, and alert, and towards evening, when it was filled like a distant heaven with the roseate dreams of the setting sun, incessantly changing and ever remaining in harmony, about the more permanent colour of the flowers themselves, with the utmost profundity, evanescence, and mystery\u2014with a quiet suggestion of infinity; afternoon or evening, it seemed to have set them flowering in the heart of the sky.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After leaving this park the Vivonne began to flow again more swiftly. How often have I watched, and longed to imitate, when I should be free to live as I chose, a rower who had shipped his oars and lay stretched out on his back, his head down, in the bottom of his boat, letting it drift with the current, seeing nothing but the sky which slipped quietly above him, shewing upon his features a foretaste of happiness and peace\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We would sit down among the irises at the water's edge. In the holiday sky a lazy cloud streamed out to its full length. Now and then, crushed by the burden of idleness, a carp would heave up out of the water, with an anxious gasp. It was time for us to feed. Before starting homewards we would sit for a long time there, eating fruit and bread and chocolate, on the grass, over which came to our ears, horizontal, faint, but solid still and metallic, the sound of the bells of Saint-Hilaire, which had melted not at all in the atmosphere it was so well accustomed to traverse, but, broken piecemeal by the successive palpitation of all their sonorous strokes, throbbed as it brushed the flowers at our feet.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, at the water's edge and embedded in trees, we would come upon a house of the kind called 'pleasure houses,' isolated and lost, seeing nothing of the world, save the river which bathed its feet. A young woman, whose pensive face and fashionable veils did not suggest a local origin, and who had doubtless come there, in the popular phrase, 'to bury herself,' to taste the bitter sweetness of feeling that her name, and still more the name of him whose heart she had once held, but had been unable to keep, were unknown there, stood framed in a window from which she had no outlook beyond the boat that was moored beside her door. She raised her eyes with an air of distraction when she heard, through the trees that lined the bank, the voices of passers-by of whom, before they came in sight, she might be certain that never had they known, nor would they know, the faithless lover, that nothing in their past lives bore his imprint, which nothing in their future would have occasion to receive. One felt that in her renunciation of life she had willingly abandoned those places in which she would at least have been able to see him whom she loved, for others where he had never trod. And I watched her, as she returned from some walk along a road where she had known that he would not appear, drawing from her submissive fingers long gloves of a precious, useless charm.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Never, in the course of our walks along the 'Guermantes way,' might we penetrate as far as the source of the Vivonne, of which I had often thought, which had in my mind so abstract, so ideal an existence, that I had been as much surprised when some one told me that it was actually to be found in the same department, and at a given number of miles from Combray, as I had been on the day when I had learned that there was another fixed point somewhere on the earth's surface, where, according to the ancients, opened the jaws of Hell. Nor could we ever reach that other goal, to which I longed so much to attain, Guermantes itself. I knew that it was the residence of its proprietors, the Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, I knew that they were real personages who did actually exist, but whenever I thought about them I pictured them to myself either in tapestry, as was the 'Coronation of Esther' which hung in our church, or else in changing, rainbow colours, as was Gilbert the Bad in his window, where he passed from cabbage green, when I was dipping my fingers in the holy water stoup, to plum blue when I had reached our row of chairs, or again altogether impalpable, like the image of Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant, ancestress of the Guermantes family, which the magic lantern sent wandering over the curtains of my room or flung aloft upon the ceiling\u2014in short, always wrapped in the mystery of the Merovingian age, and bathed, as in a sunset, in the orange light which glowed from the resounding syllable 'antes.' And if, in spite of that, they were for me, in their capacity as a duke and a duchess, real people, though of an unfamiliar kind, this ducal personality was in its turn enormously distended, immaterialised, so as to encircle and contain that Guermantes of which they were duke and duchess, all that sunlit 'Guermantes way' of our walks, the course of the Vivonne, its water-lilies and its overshadowing trees, and an endless series of hot summer afternoons. And I knew that they bore not only the titles of Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, but that since the fourteenth century, when, after vain attempts to conquer its earlier lords in battle, they had allied themselves by marriage, and so became Counts of Combray, the first citizens, consequently, of the place, and yet the only ones among its citizens who did not reside in it\u2014Comtes de Combray, possessing Combray, threading it on their string of names and titles, absorbing it in their personalities, and illustrating, no doubt, in themselves that strange and pious melancholy which was peculiar to Combray; proprietors of the town, though not of any particular house there; dwelling, presumably, out of doors, in the street, between heaven and earth, like that Gilbert de Guermantes, of whom I could see, in the stained glass of the apse of Saint-Hilaire, only the 'other side' in dull black lacquer, if I raised my eyes to look for him, when I was going to Camus's for a packet of salt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then it happened that, going the 'Guermantes way,' I passed occasionally by a row of well-watered little gardens, over whose hedges rose clusters of dark blossom. I would stop before them, hoping to gain some precious addition to my experience, for I seemed to have before my eyes a fragment of that riverside country which I had longed so much to see and know since coming upon a description of it by one of my favourite authors. And it was with that story-book land, with its imagined soil intersected by a hundred bubbling watercourses, that Guermantes, changing its form in my mind, became identified, after I heard Dr. Percepied speak of the flowers and the charming rivulets and fountains that were to be seen there in the ducal park. I used to dream that Mme. de Guermantes, taking a sudden capricious fancy for myself, invited me there, that all day long she stood fishing for trout by my side. And when evening came, holding my hand in her own, as we passed by the little gardens of her vassals, she would point out to me the flowers that leaned their red and purple spikes along the tops of the low walls, and would teach me all their names. She would make me tell her, too, all about the poems that I meant to compose. And these dreams reminded me that, since I wished, some day, to become a writer, it was high time to decide what sort of books I was going to write. But as soon as I asked myself the question, and tried to discover some subjects to which I could impart a philosophical significance of infinite value, my mind would stop like a clock, I would see before me vacuity, nothing, would feel either that I was wholly devoid of talent, or that, perhaps, a malady of the brain was hindering its development. Sometimes I would depend upon my father's arranging everything for me. He was so powerful, in such favour with the people who 'really counted,' that he made it possible for us to transgress laws which Fran\u00e7oise had taught me to regard as more ineluctable than the laws of life and death, as when we were allowed to postpone for a year the compulsory repainting of the walls of our house, alone among all the houses in that part of Paris, or when he obtained permission from the Minister for Mme. Sazerat's son, who had been ordered to some watering-place, to take his degree two months before the proper time, among the candidates whose surnames began with 'A,' instead of having to wait his turn as an 'S.' If I had fallen seriously ill, if I had been captured by brigands, convinced that my father's understanding with the supreme powers was too complete, that his letters of introduction to the Almighty were too irresistible for my illness or captivity to turn out anything but vain illusions, in which there was no danger actually threatening me, I should have awaited with perfect composure the inevitable hour of my return to comfortable realities, of my deliverance from bondage or restoration to health. Perhaps this want of talent, this black cavity which gaped in my mind when I ransacked it for the theme of my future writings, was itself no more, either, than an unsubstantial illusion, and would be brought to an end by the intervention of my father, who would arrange with the Government and with Providence that I should be the first writer of my day. But at other times, while my parents were growing impatient at seeing me loiter behind instead of following them, my actual life, instead of seeming an artificial creation by my father, and one which he could modify as he chose, appeared, on the contrary, to be comprised in a larger reality which had not been created for my benefit, from whose judgments there was no appeal, in the heart of which I was bound, helpless, without friend or ally, and beyond which no further possibilities lay concealed. It was evident to me then that I existed in the same manner as all other men, that I must grow old, that I must die like them, and that among them I was to be distinguished merely as one of those who have no aptitude for writing. And so, utterly despondent, I renounced literature for ever, despite the encouragements that had been given me by Bloch. This intimate, spontaneous feeling, this sense of the nullity of my intellect, prevailed against all the flattering speeches that might be lavished upon me, as a wicked man, when everyone is loud in the praise of his good deeds, is gnawed by the secret remorse of conscience.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day my mother said: \"You are always talking about Mme. de Guermantes. Well, Dr. Percepied did a great deal for her when she was ill, four years ago, and so she is coming to Combray for his daughter's wedding. You will be able to see her in church.\" It was from Dr. Percepied, as it happened, that I had heard most about Mme. de Guermantes, and he had even shewn us the number of an illustrated paper in which she was depicted in the costume which she had worn at a fancy dress ball given by the Princesse de L\u00e9on.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, during the nuptial mass, the beadle, by moving to one side, enabled me to see, sitting in a chapel, a lady with fair hair and a large nose, piercing blue eyes, a billowy scarf of mauve silk, glossy and new and brilliant, and a little spot at the corner of her nose. And because on the surface of her face, which was red, as though she had been very warm, I could make out, diluted and barely perceptible, details which resembled the portrait that had been shewn to me; because, more especially, the particular features which I remarked in this lady, if I attempted to catalogue them, formulated themselves in precisely the same terms:\u2014a large nose, blue eyes, as Dr. Percepied had used when describing in my presence the Duchesse de Guermantes, I said to myself: \"This lady is like the Duchesse de Guermantes.\" Now the chapel from which she was following the service was that of Gilbert the Bad; beneath its flat tombstones, yellowed and bulging like cells of honey in a comb, rested the bones of the old Counts of Brabant; and I remembered having heard it said that this chapel was reserved for the Guermantes family, whenever any of its members came to attend a ceremony at Combray; there was, indeed, but one woman resembling the portrait of Mme. de Guermantes who on that day, the very day on which she was expected to come there, could be sitting in that chapel: it was she! My disappointment was immense. It arose from my not having borne in mind, when I thought of Mme. de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a painted window, as living in another century, as being of another substance than the rest of the human race. Never had I taken into account that she might have a red face, a mauve scarf like Mme. Sazerat; and the oval curve of her cheeks reminded me so strongly of people whom I had seen at home that the suspicion brushed against my mind (though it was immediately banished) that this lady in her creative principle, in the molecules of her physical composition, was perhaps not substantially the Duchesse de Guermantes, but that her body, in ignorance of the name that people had given it, belonged to a certain type of femininity which included, also, the wives of doctors and tradesmen. \"It is, it must be Mme. de Guermantes, and no one else!\" were the words underlying the attentive and astonished expression with which I was gazing upon this image, which, naturally enough, bore no resemblance to those that had so often, under the same title of 'Mme. de Guermantes,' appeared to me in dreams, since this one had not been, like the others, formed arbitrarily by myself, but had sprung into sight for the first time, only a moment ago, here in church; an image which was not of the same nature, was not colourable at will, like those others that allowed themselves to imbibe the orange tint of a sonorous syllable, but which was so real that everything, even to the fiery little spot at the corner of her nose, gave an assurance of her subjection to the laws of life, as in a transformation scene on the stage a crease in the dress of a fairy, a quivering of her tiny finger, indicate the material presence of a living actress before our eyes, whereas we were uncertain, till then, whether we were not looking merely at a projection of limelight from a lantern.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile I was endeavouring to apply to this image, which the prominent nose, the piercing eyes pinned down and fixed in my field of vision (perhaps because it was they that had first struck it, that had made the first impression on its surface, before I had had time to wonder whether the woman who thus appeared before me might possibly be Mme. de Guermantes), to this fresh and unchanging image the idea: \"It is Mme. de Guermantes\"; but I succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and the image, as though they were two discs moving in separate planes, with a space between. But this Mme. de Guermantes of whom I had so often dreamed, now that I could see that she had a real existence independent of myself, acquired a fresh increase of power over my imagination, which, paralysed for a moment by contact with a reality so different from anything that it had expected, began to react and to say within me: \"Great and glorious before the days of Charlemagne, the Guermantes had the right of life and death over their vassals; the Duchesse de Guermantes descends from Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant. She does not know, nor would she consent to know, any of the people who are here to-day.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then\u2014oh, marvellous independence of the human gaze, tied to the human face by a cord so loose, so long, so elastic that it can stray, alone, as far as it may choose\u2014while Mme. de Guermantes sat in the chapel above the tombs of her dead ancestors, her gaze lingered here and wandered there, rose to the capitals of the pillars, and even rested upon myself, like a ray of sunlight straying down the nave, but a ray of sunlight which, at the moment when I received its caress, appeared conscious of where it fell. As for Mme. de Guermantes herself, since she remained there motionless, sitting like a mother who affects not to notice the rude or awkward conduct of her children who, in the course of their play, are speaking to people whom she does not know, it was impossible for me to determine whether she approved or condemned the vagrancy of her eyes in the careless detachment of her heart.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt it to be important that she should not leave the church before I had been able to look long enough upon her, reminding myself that for years past I had regarded the sight of her as a thing eminently to be desired, and I kept my eyes fixed on her, as though by gazing at her I should be able to carry away and incorporate, to store up, for later reference, in myself the memory of that prominent nose, those red cheeks, of all those details which struck me as so much precious, authentic, unparalleled information with regard to her face. And now that, whenever I brought my mind to bear upon that face\u2014and especially, perhaps, in my determination, that form of the instinct of self-preservation with which we guard everything that is best in ourselves, not to admit that I had been in any way deceived\u2014I found only beauty there; setting her once again (since they were one and the same person, this lady who sat before me and that Duchesse de Guermantes whom, until then, I had been used to conjure into an imagined shape) apart from and above that common run of humanity with which the sight, pure and simple, of her in the flesh had made me for a moment confound her, I grew indignant when I heard people saying, in the congregation round me: \"She is better looking than Mme. Sazerat\" or \"than Mlle. Vinteuil,\" as though she had been in any way comparable with them. And my gaze resting upon her fair hair, her blue eyes, the lines of her neck, and overlooking the features which might have reminded me of the faces of other women, I cried out within myself, as I admired this deliberately unfinished sketch: \"How lovely she is! What true nobility! it is indeed a proud Guermantes, the descendant of Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant, that I have before me!\" And the care which I took to focus all my attention upon her face succeeded in isolating it so completely that to-day, when I call that marriage ceremony to mind, I find it impossible to visualise any single person who was present except her, and the beadle who answered me in the affirmative when I inquired whether the lady was, indeed, Mme. de Guermantes. But her, I can see her still quite clearly, especially at the moment when the procession filed into the sacristy, lighted by the intermittent, hot sunshine of a windy and rainy day, where Mme. de Guermantes found herself in the midst of all those Combray people whose names, even, she did not know, but whose inferiority proclaimed her own supremacy so loud that she must, in return, feel for them a genuine, pitying sympathy, and whom she might count on impressing even more forcibly by virtue of her simplicity and natural charm. And then, too, since she could not bring into play the deliberate glances, charged with a definite meaning, which one directs, in a crowd, towards people whom one knows, but must allow her vague thoughts to escape continually from her eyes in a flood of blue light which she was powerless to control, she was anxious not to distress in any way, not to seem to be despising those humbler mortals over whom that current flowed, by whom it was everywhere arrested. I can see again to-day, above her mauve scarf, silky and buoyant, the gentle astonishment in her eyes, to which she had added, without daring to address it to anyone in particular, but so that everyone might enjoy his share of it, the almost timid smile of a sovereign lady who seems to be making an apology for her presence among the vassals whom she loves. This smile rested upon myself, who had never ceased to follow her with my eyes. And I, remembering the glance which she had let fall upon me during the service, blue as a ray of sunlight that had penetrated the window of Gilbert the Bad, said to myself, \"Of course, she is thinking about me.\" I fancied that I had found favour in her sight, that she would continue to think of me after she had left the church, and would, perhaps, grow pensive again, that evening, at Guermantes, on my account. And at once I fell in love with her, for if it is sometimes enough to make us love a woman that she looks on us with contempt, as I supposed Mlle. Swann to have done, while we imagine that she cannot ever be ours, it is enough, also, sometimes that she looks on us kindly, as Mme. de Guermantes did then, while we think of her as almost ours already. Her eyes waxed blue as a periwinkle flower, wholly beyond my reach, yet dedicated by her to me; and the sun, bursting out again from behind a threatening cloud and darting the full force of its rays on to the Square and into the sacristy, shed a geranium glow over the red carpet laid down for the wedding, along which Mme. de Guermantes smilingly advanced, and covered its woollen texture with a nap of rosy velvet, a bloom of light, giving it that sort of tenderness, of solemn sweetness in the pomp of a joyful celebration, which characterises certain pages of Lohengrin, certain paintings by Carpaccio, and makes us understand how Baudelaire was able to apply to the sound of the trumpet the epithet 'delicious.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How often, after that day, in the course of my walks along the 'Guermantes way,' and with what an intensified melancholy did I reflect on my lack of qualification for a literary career, and that I must abandon all hope of ever becoming a famous author. The regret that I felt for this, while I lingered alone to dream for a little by myself, made me suffer so acutely that, in order not to feel it, my mind of its own accord, by a sort of inhibition in the instant of pain, ceased entirely to think of verse-making, of fiction, of the poetic future on which my want of talent precluded me from counting. Then, quite apart from all those literary preoccupations, and without definite attachment to anything, suddenly a roof, a gleam of sunlight reflected from a stone, the smell of a road would make me stop still, to enjoy the special pleasure that each of them gave me, and also because they appeared to be concealing, beneath what my eyes could see, something which they invited me to approach and seize from them, but which, despite all my efforts, I never managed to discover. As I felt that the mysterious object was to be found in them, I would stand there in front of them, motionless, gazing, breathing, endeavouring to penetrate with my mind beyond the thing seen or smelt. And if I had then to hasten after my grandfather, to proceed on my way, I would still seek to recover my sense of them by closing my eyes; I would concentrate upon recalling exactly the line of the roof, the colour of the stone, which, without my being able to understand why, had seemed to me to be teeming, ready to open, to yield up to me the secret treasure of which they were themselves no more than the outer coverings. It was certainly not any impression of this kind that could or would restore the hope I had lost of succeeding one day in becoming an author and poet, for each of them was associated with some material object devoid of any intellectual value, and suggesting no abstract truth. But at least they gave me an unreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity of mind; and in that way distracted me from the tedium, from the sense of my own impotence which I had felt whenever I had sought a philosophic theme for some great literary work. So urgent was the task imposed on my conscience by these impressions of form or perfume or colour\u2014to strive for a perception of what lay hidden beneath them, that I was never long in seeking an excuse which would allow me to relax so strenuous an effort and to spare myself the fatigue that it involved. As good luck would have it, my parents called me; I felt that I had not, for the moment, the calm environment necessary for a successful pursuit of my researches, and that it would be better to think no more of the matter until I reached home, and not to exhaust myself in the meantime to no purpose. And so I concerned myself no longer with the mystery that lay hidden in a form or a perfume, quite at ease in my mind, since I was taking it home with me, protected by its visible and tangible covering, beneath which I should find it still alive, like the fish which, on days when I had been allowed to go out fishing, I used to carry back in my basket, buried in a couch of grass which kept them cool and fresh. Once in the house again I would begin to think of something else, and so my mind would become littered (as my room was with the flowers that I had gathered on my walks, or the odds and ends that people had given me) with a stone from the surface of which the sunlight was reflected, a roof, the sound of a bell, the smell of fallen leaves, a confused mass of different images, under which must have perished long ago the reality of which I used to have some foreboding, but which I never had the energy to discover and bring to light. Once, however, when we had prolonged our walk far beyond its ordinary limits, and so had been very glad to encounter, half way home, as afternoon darkened into evening, Dr. Percepied, who drove past us at full speed in his carriage, saw and recognised us, stopped, and made us jump in beside him, I received an impression of this sort which I did not abandon without having first subjected it to an examination a little more thorough. I had been set on the box beside the coachman, we were going like the wind because the Doctor had still, before returning to Combray, to call at Martinville-le-Sec, at the house of a patient, at whose door he asked us to wait for him. At a bend in the road I experienced, suddenly, that special pleasure, which bore no resemblance to any other, when I caught sight of the twin steeples of Martinville, on which the setting sun was playing, while the movement of the carriage and the windings of the road seemed to keep them continually changing their position; and then of a third steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, which, although separated from them by a hill and a valley, and rising from rather higher ground in the distance, appeared none the less to be standing by their side.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In ascertaining and noting the shape of their spires, the changes of aspect, the sunny warmth of their surfaces, I felt that I was not penetrating to the full depth of my impression, that something more lay behind that mobility, that luminosity, something which they seemed at once to contain and to conceal.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The steeples appeared so distant, and we ourselves seemed to come so little nearer them, that I was astonished when, a few minutes later, we drew up outside the church of Martinville. I did not know the reason for the pleasure which I had found in seeing them upon the horizon, and the business of trying to find out what that reason was seemed to me irksome; I wished only to keep in reserve in my brain those converging lines, moving in the sunshine, and, for the time being, to think of them no more. And it is probable that, had I done so, those two steeples would have vanished for ever, in a great medley of trees and roofs and scents and sounds which I had noticed and set apart on account of the obscure sense of pleasure which they gave me, but without ever exploring them more fully. I got down from the box to talk to my parents while we were waiting for the Doctor to reappear. Then it was time to start; I climbed up again to my place, turning my head to look back, once more, at my steeples, of which, a little later, I caught a farewell glimpse at a turn in the road. The coachman, who seemed little inclined for conversation, having barely acknowledged my remarks, I was obliged, in default of other society, to fall back on my own, and to attempt to recapture the vision of my steeples. And presently their outlines and their sunlit surface, as though they had been a sort of rind, were stripped apart; a little of what they had concealed from me became apparent; an idea came into my mind which had not existed for me a moment earlier, framed itself in words in my head; and the pleasure with which the first sight of them, just now, had filled me was so much enhanced that, overpowered by a sort of intoxication, I could no longer think of anything but them. At this point, although we had now travelled a long way from Martinville, I turned my head and caught sight of them again, quite black this time, for the sun had meanwhile set. Every few minutes a turn in the road would sweep them out of sight; then they shewed themselves for the last time, and so I saw them no more.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without admitting to myself that what lay buried within the steeples of Martinville must be something analogous to a charming phrase, since it was in the form of words which gave me pleasure that it had appeared to me, I borrowed a pencil and some paper from the Doctor, and composed, in spite of the jolting of the carriage, to appease my conscience and to satisfy my enthusiasm, the following little fragment, which I have since discovered, and now reproduce, with only a slight revision here and there.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_______________________________________\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alone, rising from the level of the plain, and seemingly lost in that expanse of open country, climbed to the sky the twin steeples of Martinville. Presently we saw three: springing into position confronting them by a daring volt, a third, a dilatory steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, was come to join them. The minutes passed, we were moving rapidly, and yet the three steeples were always a long way ahead of us, like three birds perched upon the plain, motionless and conspicuous in the sunlight. Then the steeple of Vieuxvicq withdrew, took its proper distance, and the steeples of Martinville remained alone, gilded by the light of the setting sun, which, even at that distance, I could see playing and smiling upon their sloped sides. We had been so long in approaching them that I was thinking of the time that must still elapse before we could reach them when, of a sudden, the carriage, having turned a corner, set us down at their feet; and they had flung themselves so abruptly in our path that we had barely time to stop before being dashed against the porch of the church.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We resumed our course; we had left Martinville some little time, and the village, after accompanying us for a few seconds, had already disappeared, when, lingering alone on the horizon to watch our flight, its steeples and that of Vieuxvicq waved once again, in token of farewell, their sun-bathed pinnacles. Sometimes one would withdraw, so that the other two might watch us for a moment still; then the road changed direction, they veered in the light like three golden pivots, and vanished from my gaze. But, a little later, when we were already close to Combray, the sun having set meanwhile, I caught sight of them for the last time, far away, and seeming no more now than three flowers painted upon the sky above the low line of fields. They made me think, too, of three maidens in a legend, abandoned in a solitary place over which night had begun to fall; and while we drew away from them at a gallop, I could see them timidly seeking their way, and, after some awkward, stumbling movements of their noble silhouettes, drawing close to one another, slipping one behind another, shewing nothing more, now, against the still rosy sky than a single dusky form, charming and resigned, and so vanishing in the night.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_______________________________________\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I never thought again of this page, but at the moment when, on my corner of the box-seat, where the Doctor's coachman was in the habit of placing, in a hamper, the fowls which he had bought at Martinville market, I had finished writing it, I found such a sense of happiness, felt that it had so entirely relieved my mind of the obsession of the steeples, and of the mystery which they concealed, that, as though I myself were a hen and had just laid an egg, I began to sing at the top of my voice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All day long, during these walks, I had been able to muse upon the pleasure that there would be in the friendship of the Duchesse de Guermantes, in fishing for trout, in drifting by myself in a boat on the Vivonne; and, greedy for happiness, I asked nothing more from life, in such moments, than that it should consist always of a series of joyous afternoons. But when, on our way home, I had caught sight of a farm, on the left of the road, at some distance from two other farms which were themselves close together, and from which, to return to Combray, we need only turn down an avenue of oaks, bordered on one side by a series of orchard-closes, each one planted at regular intervals with apple-trees which cast upon the ground, when they were lighted by the setting sun, the Japanese stencil of their shadows; then, sharply, my heart would begin to beat, I would know that in half an hour we should be at home, and that there, as was the rule on days when we had taken the 'Guermantes way' and dinner was, in consequence, served later than usual, I should be sent to bed as soon as I had swallowed my soup, so that my mother, kept at table, just as though there had been company to dinner, would not come upstairs to say good night to me in bed. The zone of melancholy which I then entered was totally distinct from that other zone, in which I had been bounding for joy a moment earlier, just as sometimes in the sky a band of pink is separated, as though by a line invisibly ruled, from a band of green or black. You may see a bird flying across the pink; it draws near the border-line, touches it, enters and is lost upon the black. The longings by which I had just now been absorbed, to go to Guermantes, to travel, to live a life of happiness\u2014I was now so remote from them that their fulfilment would have afforded me no pleasure. How readily would I have sacrificed them all, just to be able to cry, all night long, in the arms of Mamma! Shuddering with emotion, I could not take my agonised eyes from my mother's face, which was not to appear that evening in the bedroom where I could see myself already lying, in imagination; and wished only that I were lying dead. And this state would persist until the morrow, when, the rays of morning leaning their bars of light, as the gardener might lean his ladder, against the wall overgrown with nasturtiums, which clambered up it as far as my window-sill, I would leap out of bed to run down at once into the garden, with no thought of the fact that evening must return, and with it the hour when I must leave my mother. And so it was from the 'Guermantes way' that I learned to distinguish between these states which reigned alternately in my mind, during certain periods, going so far as to divide every day between them, each one returning to dispossess the other with the regularity of a fever and ague: contiguous, and yet so foreign to one another, so devoid of means of communication, that I could no longer understand, or even picture to myself, in one state what I had desired or dreaded or even done in the other.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' and the 'Guermantes way' remain for me linked with many of the little incidents of that one of all the divers lives along whose parallel lines we are moved, which is the most abundant in sudden reverses of fortune, the richest in episodes; I mean the life of the mind. Doubtless it makes in us an imperceptible progress, and the truths which have changed for us its meaning and its aspect, which have opened new paths before our feet, we had for long been preparing for their discovery; but that preparation was unconscious; and for us those truths date only from the day, from the minute when they became apparent. The flowers which played then among the grass, the water which rippled past in the sunshine, the whole landscape which served as environment to their apparition lingers around the memory of them still with its unconscious or unheeding air; and, certainly, when they were slowly scrutinised by this humble passer-by, by this dreaming child\u2014as the face of a king is scrutinised by a petitioner lost in the crowd\u2014that scrap of nature, that corner of a garden could never suppose that it would be thanks to him that they would be elected to survive in all their most ephemeral details; and yet the scent of hawthorn which strays plundering along the hedge from which, in a little while, the dog-roses will have banished it, a sound of footsteps followed by no echo, upon a gravel path, a bubble formed at the side of a waterplant by the current, and formed only to burst\u2014my exaltation of mind has borne them with it, and has succeeded in making them traverse all these successive years, while all around them the one-trodden ways have vanished, while those who thronged those ways, and even the memory of those who thronged those trodden ways, are dead. Sometimes the fragment of landscape thus transported into the present will detach itself in such isolation from all associations that it floats uncertainly upon my mind, like a flowering isle of Delos, and I am unable to say from what place, from what time\u2014perhaps, quite simply, from which of my dreams\u2014it comes. But it is pre-eminently as the deepest layer of my mental soil, as firm sites on which I still may build, that I regard the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise and Guermantes 'ways.' It is because I used to think of certain things, of certain people, while I was roaming along them, that the things, the people which they taught me to know, and these alone, I still take seriously, still give me joy. Whether it be that the faith which creates has ceased to exist in me, or that reality will take shape in the memory alone, the flowers that people shew me nowadays for the first time never seem to me to be true flowers. The 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' with its lilacs, its hawthorns, its cornflowers, its poppies, its apple-trees, the 'Guermantes way' with its river full of tadpoles, its water-lilies, and its buttercups have constituted for me for all time the picture of the land in which I fain would pass my life, in which my only requirements are that I may go out fishing, drift idly in a boat, see the ruins of a gothic fortress in the grass, and find hidden among the cornfields\u2014as Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs lay hidden\u2014an old church, monumental, rustic, and yellow like a mill-stone; and the cornflowers, the hawthorns, the apple-trees which I may happen, when I go walking, to encounter in the fields, because they are situated at the same depth, on the level of my past life, at once establish contact with my heart. And yet, because there is an element of individuality in places, when I am seized with a desire to see again the 'Guermantes way,' it would not be satisfied were I led to the banks of a river in which were lilies as fair, or even fairer than those in the Vivonne, any more than on my return home in the evening, at the hour when there awakened in me that anguish which, later on in life, transfers itself to the passion of love, and may even become its inseparable companion, I should have wished for any strange mother to come in and say good night to me, though she were far more beautiful and more intelligent than my own. No: just as the one thing necessary to send me to sleep contented (in that untroubled peace which no mistress, in later years, has ever been able to give me, since one has doubts of them at the moment when one believes in them, and never can possess their hearts as I used to receive, in her kiss, the heart of my mother, complete, without scruple or reservation, unburdened by any liability save to myself) was that it should be my mother who came, that she should incline towards me that face on which there was, beneath her eye, something that was, it appears, a blemish, and which I loved as much as all the rest\u2014so what I want to see again is the 'Guermantes way' as I knew it, with the farm that stood a little apart from the two neighbouring farms, pressed so close together, at the entrance to the oak avenue; those meadows upon whose surface, when it is polished by the sun to the mirroring radiance of a lake, are outlined the leaves of the apple-trees; that whole landscape whose individuality sometimes, at night, in my dreams, binds me with a power that is almost fantastic, of which I can discover no trace when I awake.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt, by virtue of having permanently and indissolubly combined in me groups of different impressions, for no reason save that they had made me feel several separate things at the same time, the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise and Guermantes 'ways' left me exposed, in later life, to much disillusionment, and even to many mistakes. For often I have wished to see a person again without realising that it was simply because that person recalled to me a hedge of hawthorns in blossom; and I have been led to believe, and to make some one else believe in an aftermath of affection, by what was no more than an inclination to travel. But by the same qualities, and by their persistence in those of my impressions, to-day, to which they can find an attachment, the two 'ways' give to those impressions a foundation, depth, a dimension lacking from the rest. They invest them, too, with a charm, a significance which is for me alone. When, on a summer evening, the resounding sky growls like a tawny lion, and everyone is complaining of the storm, it is along the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' that my fancy strays alone in ecstasy, inhaling, through the noise of falling rain, the odour of invisible and persistent lilac-trees.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so I would often lie until morning, dreaming of the old days at Combray, of my melancholy and wakeful evenings there; of other days besides, the memory of which had been more lately restored to me by the taste\u2014by what would have been called at Combray the 'perfume'\u2014-of a cup of tea; and, by an association of memories, of a story which, many years after I had left the little place, had been told me of a love affair in which Swann had been involved before I was born; with that accuracy of detail which it is easier, often, to obtain when we are studying the lives of people who have been dead for centuries than when we are trying to chronicle those of our own most intimate friends, an accuracy which it seems as impossible to attain as it seemed impossible to speak from one town to another, before we learned of the contrivance by which that impossibility has been overcome. All these memories, following one after another, were condensed into a single substance, but had not so far coalesced that I could not discern between the three strata, between my oldest, my instinctive memories, those others, inspired more recently by a taste or 'perfume,' and those which were actually the memories of another, from whom I had acquired them at second hand\u2014no fissures, indeed, no geological faults, but at least those veins, those streaks of colour which in certain rocks, in certain marbles, point to differences of origin, age, and formation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that, when morning drew near, I would long have settled the brief uncertainty of my waking dream, I would know in what room I was actually lying, would have reconstructed it round about me in the darkness, and\u2014fixing my orientation by memory alone, or with the assistance of a feeble glimmer of light at the foot of which I placed the curtains and the window\u2014would have reconstructed it complete and with its furniture, as an architect and an upholsterer might do, working upon an original, discarded plan of the doors and windows; would have replaced the mirrors and set the chest-of-drawers on its accustomed site. 'But scarcely had daylight itself\u2014and no longer the gleam from a last, dying ember on a brass curtain-rod, which I had mistaken for daylight\u2014traced across the darkness, as with a stroke of chalk across a blackboard, its first white correcting ray, when the window, with its curtains, would leave the frame of the doorway, in which I had erroneously placed it, while, to make room for it, the writing-table, which my memory had clumsily fixed where the window ought to be, would hurry off at full speed, thrusting before it the mantelpiece, and sweeping aside the wall of the passage; the well of the courtyard would be enthroned on the spot where, a moment earlier, my dressing-room had lain, and the dwelling-place which I had built up for myself in the darkness would have gone to join all those other dwellings of which I had caught glimpses from the whirlpool of awakening; put to flight by that pale sign traced above my window-curtains by the uplifted forefinger of day.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/4199541", "artist_names": "TheHills79", "full_title": "2019 thehills79 Listening Log by\u00a0TheHills79", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/aea4b4f97a17ffe223269e33499876a2.300x200x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/aea4b4f97a17ffe223269e33499876a2.500x334x1.jpg", "id": 4199541, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 4001617, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1603120093, "path": "/Thehills79-2019-thehills79-listening-log-annotated", "pyongs_count": 4, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Thehills79-2019-thehills79-listening-log-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 2}, "release_date_for_display": "January 2, 2019", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jan. 2, 2019", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/aea4b4f97a17ffe223269e33499876a2.300x200x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/aea4b4f97a17ffe223269e33499876a2.500x334x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "2019 thehills79 Listening Log", "title_with_featured": "2019 thehills79 Listening Log", "updated_by_human_at": 1603120093, "url": "https://genius.com/Thehills79-2019-thehills79-listening-log-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/1108110", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/62e642e29c353394e8562b4b6e2b344e.564x513x1.jpg", "id": 1108110, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5e3bdea6c8a00c238d77c42da88c69bb.500x500x1.jpg", "index_character": "t", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "TheHills79", "slug": "Thehills79", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Thehills79"}, "artist": "TheHills79", "lyrics": "2019 thehills79 Listening Log LyricsJanuary 7, 2019 MondayExpectations by Hayley KiyokoJanuary 8, 2019 TuesdayExpectations by Hayley KiyokoJanuary 9, 2019 Wednesday\"WHEN I WAS OLDER\" by Billie EilishJanuary 10, 2019 ThursdayExpectations by Hayley KiyokoJanuary 11, 2019 Friday\"Dancing With a Stranger\" by Normani & Sam Smith \u2764 \"Lost in the Fire\" by Gesaffelstein & The WeekndJanuary 12, 2019 Saturday\"Alien\" by Sabrina Carpenter ft.

Others demand a ban on photographs.\n\nFrom where I\u2019m sitting in the back, my hand inches up, and I stand and explain that I am a writer who covers resistance movements. I promise not to take pictures.\n\nJust then, a heavyset man in a tight T-shirt, with patchy dark hair and a beard, starts snapping photos. He is Bob Arihood, a fixture of the neighborhood known for documenting it with his camera and his blog. People shout at him to stop; he shouts back something about the nature of public space. Soon, a few from the group break off to talk things through with him, and the discussion turns back to me.\n\nThe interrogation and harrowing debate that follow are less about me, really, than about them. Are they holdin a public meeting or a private one? Is a journalist to be regarded as an agent of the state or a potential ally? Can they expect to maintain their anonymity?\nAfter half an hour, at last, I witness an act of consensus: hands rise above heads, fingers wiggle. I can stay. A little later, I see that Arihood and the people who\u2019d gone to confront him are laughing together.\n\nThose present were mainly, but not exclusively, young, and when they spoke, they introduced themselves as students, artists, organizers, teachers. There were a lot of beards and hand-rolled cigarettes, though neither seemed obligatory. On the side of the circle nearest the tree were the facilitators\u2014David Graeber, a noted anthropologist, and Marisa Holmes, a brown-haired, brown-eyed filmmaker in her midtwenties who had spent the summer interviewing revolutionaries in Egypt. Elders, such as a Vietnam vet from Staten Island, were listened to with particular care. It was a common rhetorical tic to address the group as \u201cYou beautiful people,\u201d which happened to be not just encouraging but also empirically true.\n\nSeveral had accents from revolutionary places\u2014Spain, Greece, Latin America\u2014or had been working to create ties among pro-democracy movements in other countries. Vlad Teichberg, leaning against the Hare Krishna Tree and pecking at the keys of a pink laptop, was one of the architects of the Internet video channel Global Revolution. With his Spanish wife, Nikky Schiller, he had been in Madrid during the May 15 movement\u2019s occupation at Puerta del Sol. Alexa O\u2019Brien, a slender woman with blond hair and black-rimmed glasses, covered the Arab Spring for the website WikiLeaks Central and had been collaborating with organizers of the subsequent uprisings in Europe; now, she was trying to foment a movement called US Day of Rage, named after the big days of protest in the Middle East.\n\nThat meeting would last five hours, followed by working groups convening in huddles and in nearby bars. I\u2019d never heard young people talking politics quite like this, with so much seriousness and revelry and determination. But their unease was also visible when a police car passed, and conversation slowed; a member of the Tactics Committee had pointed out that, since any group of twenty or more in a New York City park needs a permit, we were already breaking the law.\n\nFault lines were forming, too. Some liked the idea of coming up with one demand and others didn\u2019t. Some wanted regulation, others revolution. I heard the slogan \u201cWe are the 99 percent\u201d for the first time when Chris, a member of the Food Committee, proposed it as a tagline. There were murmurs of approval but also calls for something more militant: \u201cWe are your crisis.\u201d When the idea came up of having a meeting on the picket line with striking Verizon workers, O\u2019Brien blocked consensus. She didn\u2019t want the assembly to lose its independence by siding with a union.\n\n\u201cWe need to appeal to the right as well as the left,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTo the right?\u201d a graduate student behind me muttered. \u201cWow.\u201d\n\nJust about the only thing everyone could agree on was the fantasy of crowds filling the area around Wall Street and staying until they overthrew the corporate oligarchy, or until they were driven out. As the evening grew darker, a pack of intern-aged boys walked by, looking as if they had just left a bar, and noticed the meeting\u2019s slow progress. One of them, wearing a polo shirt, held up a broken beer mug and shouted, at an inebriated pace, \u201cIf you always act later, you might forget the now!\u201d\n\nBob Arihood died of a heart attack at the end of September, after he exhausted himself photographing a march from the Financial District to Union Square. By then, the idea that the New York City General Assembly had been planning for was a reality, spreading fast. One of his photos of the meeting survives on his blog, the only picture of its kind I\u2019ve found. In that cluster of people around the banner, almost everyone is looking toward the camera; a guy I now know as Richie, dressed in white, is pointing right into the lens. Some look curious, some suspicious, some scared, some indifferent. I\u2019m barely visible in a far corner of the group.\n\nI recognize most of the others now in a way I couldn\u2019t then. Some have had their names and faces broadcast on the news all over the world. There\u2019s the woman from LaRouchePAC with such a good singing voice, and the group who went to high school together in North Dakota. When I showed Arihood\u2019s picture to a friend, he recognized his former roommate from art school. I try to guess what the ones I know best were thinking, what it was exactly that they imagined they were doing there\u2014so expectant, so at odds with one another, so anxious about being watched.\n\nThe saying \u201cYou had to be there\u201d typically comes at the end of a joke that didn\u2019t get the right reaction, that set up high hopes but by the time of the punchline fell flat. If you were there, after all, you\u2019d know that something happened that really was significant or funny or worth repeating. I keep wanting to say those words again and again about Occupy Wall Street\u2014\u201cyou had to be there,\u201d \u201cyou had to be there!\u201d\u2014but I stop myself, because doing so would also be an admission of defeat. Those words are a conversation stopper. If I say them I\u2019m giving up on even trying to convey why Occupy Wall Street was such a momentous thing, and such a rare moment of political hope for us who were born during the past thirty years in the United States of America.\n\nFor nearly two months in the fall of 2011, a square block of granite and honey locust trees in New York\u2019s Financial District, right between Wall Street and the World Trade Center, became a canvas for the image of another world. In occupied Zuccotti Park, thousands of people ate, slept, met, talked, argued, read, planned, and were dragged away to jail. Many came to protest the most abstract of wrongs\u2014the deregulation of high finance, the funding of electoral campaigns, the erosion of the social safety net, the logic of mass incarceration, the failure to address climate change\u2014but what they found was something more tangible. There was a community in formation, which they would have a hand in forming; there was work to be done, which they would do with people and ideas that the world outside had insulated them from ever considering.\n\nBefore the occupation itself, there was a process by which a few hundred people, inspired by what they saw happening overseas, found the wherewithal to imagine, plan, and resist. After the encampment ended, the many thousands who had experienced it faced a crisis of what to do next.\nOver the course of a year of being immersed in Occupy Wall Street, I saw a veil being lifted. Etymologically, the lifting of a veil is what the word apocalypse refers to; after that, one can\u2019t go back unchanged. The preceding world has passed, and a new revelation is at hand. Nobody who worked to make Occupy Wall Street happen imagined anything much like what actually did: it altered them and transformed them and messed with them. The movement\u2019s most unsettling features were often the same ones that made it work\u2014in addition to being at fault for the extent to which the Occupy joke ended up falling flat.\n\nBut disappointment is part of any apocalypse. The fact that the most radical aspirations of Occupy Wall Street remain unrealized is also a symptom of success; images that it promulgated of shutting down Wall Street and mounting a general strike became implanted in people\u2019s minds, if even just to provide a measure of how those images failed to become manifest.\n\nThis was movement time, the nonlinear and momentous kind of temporality that the Greeks called kairos. The dumb piece of red sculpture that towers over Zuccotti Park\u2014the \u201cBig Red Thing\u201d\u2014now has in my nervous system the chill-inducing and undeserved status of Beacon of the Real, as the first thing I\u2019d see when approaching the occupation from the subway. Under that distracting piece of corporate abstraction, a living work of art brought every aspect of life into a sharper kind of focus. It was a utopian act, but in the form of realism. With artists mainly in charge, Occupy Wall Street was art before it was anything properly organized, before it was even politics. It was there to change us first and make demands later.\n\nAnd so it did. Like probably thousands of other underemployed Brooklynites who otherwise had no business being in the Financial District, I came to know that area\u2019s twisty streets like the neighborhood I grew up in. And, now, fearing that my generation might slip back into irony and apathy and unreality, I feel an urgent, evangelistic duty to record as best I can the sliver of this reality that I experienced.\n\nWhat first brought me to Occupy Wall Street, in some respects, dates back to 2001. I was in high school and had an internship at Pacifica Radio in Washington DC. My first and only reporting job there was to cover a protest against the invasion of Afghanistan, just a few days before the invasion began. I followed the course of the march, and interviewed people, and wasn\u2019t sure whether I should be marching too or standing at a professional distance. It was a moderately impressive display, and yet of course the war went on.\n\nThen, in early 2003, the same thing happened, only more so. The worldwide protests against the invasion of Iraq were the largest mobilization in history, and the war happened anyway. The newspapers hardly even noticed the opposition. A lot of us who were young enough to believe that we could turn back the bombers if our slogans were loud enough retreated into disappointment and the complacent cynicism of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. But those protests lodged a question in my head: What would it have taken to make a difference? What would it have taken to capture people\u2019s imaginations and keep them from letting the politicians lead us into disaster again?\n\nFor the most part, though, I turned my attention to other things. I converted to Catholicism and studied religion. I went to graduate school and started writing for magazines. By the time the middle of 2011 came around, I was putting off finishing a quixotic book I\u2019d been writing for years about how and why people concoct proofs about the existence of God. This put me in a fidgety mood, primed for apocalyptic distractions.\n\nI had been watching revolutions from a distance since the beginning of the year, when people rose up and expelled dictators in Tunisia and Egypt, stirring up Libya, Bahrain, Syria, Jordan, and more. Continually refreshing my social media feeds, with Al Jazeera on in the background, I tried my best to blog each day about whatever was happening in the Middle East. I wanted to understand where these movements came from, who organized them, and how. Experts in the United States were satisfied with attributing the uprisings to global food prices and Twitter, but the revolutionaries themselves didn\u2019t use the language of economic or technological determinism. In interviews, they seemed instead to talk about having rediscovered their agency, their collective power, their ability to act.\n\nOver the summer, I attended a seminar in Boston with civil resisters from around the world. Some were still glowing from recent success, like the Egyptians who\u2019d helped overthrow Hosni Mubarak, while others, like the Tibetan and the two from Burma, remained so far from what they longed for. They shared their goals and their strategies, as well as their sacrifices\u2014for many of them, imprisonment and torture. They had arguments and epiphanies. They learned from what one another was doing and thinking, and grew stronger as a result.\n\nDuring a break in the discussion, I noticed a photocopied essay by one of those at the seminar, a memoir of her time in the civil rights movement. The essay opened with a passage from a nineteenth-century poem born of the struggle over slavery. It described a moment arising, or a movement, in which a whole society is forced to choose where it stands: \u201cSome great cause, God's new Messiah.\u201d When might such a moment, or a movement, come to us in the United States again? Those words became my mission.\n\nI left that meeting with something lit up inside me. I now knew the kinds of stories I needed to learn how to tell\u2014the stories of how people go from wanting to resist to actually doing so, of how by reasoning and creativity they learn to build power. I wasn\u2019t interested so much in reporting on more protests, coming and going with the spectacle; I wanted to experience the planning and organizing by which the spectacle, and whatever comes of it, came about. So when I returned home to New York, I started looking for the planning process of some great cause to follow and to learn from. It turned out that this would be easier than I expected\u2014and that the spectacle would be the process itself.\n\n* * *\n\nRevolution didn\u2019t seem like such a crazy idea in 2011. Just a few weeks into the year, two dictators had already bowed to the power of the people. By late February, the victorious Egyptians were phoning in pizza-delivery orders to the occupied Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison. Unrest followed the summer\u2019s heat to Greece, Spain, and England. Europe\u2019s summer was Chile\u2019s winter, but students and unions rose up there too. Tel Aviv grew a tent city.\nWhile Tahrir Square in Cairo was still full, the boutique-y activist art magazine Adbusters published a blog post imagining \u201cA Million Man March on Wall Street.\u201d But the United States appeared to go quiet after Madison, its politics again domesticated by talk of the \u201cdebt ceiling\u201d and the Iowa Straw Poll; when tens of thousands actually did march on Wall Street on May 12, few noticed and fewer remembered.\n\nWhile following the march that day on Twitter from Florida, however, a thirty-two-year-old drifter using the pseudonym Gary Roland read about another action planned near Wall Street for the next month: Operation Empire State Rebellion, or OpESR. That tweet led him to a dot-commer-turned-activist-journalist named David DeGraw. DeGraw was working through the Internet entity known as Anonymous, which over the past year or two had been emerging from various cesspools online into a swarm of vigilantes for justice. With Anonymous, DeGraw had helped build safe networks for the dissidents of the Arab Spring. Since early 2010 he had also been writing about his vision of a movement closer to home, a movement in which the lower 99 percent of the United States would rebel against the rapacity and corruption of the top 1 percent. An Anonymous unit formed to organize OpESR, calling itself A99.\n\nThrough DeGraw\u2019s website, Roland helped make plans. Having recently lost his job as a construction manager for a New York real estate firm, he was familiar with the city\u2019s public spaces and the laws applying to them. He proposed that OpESR try to occupy Zuccotti Park, a publicly accessible place privately owned by Brookfield Office Properties. On June 14\u2014Flag Day\u2014Zuccotti Park would be their target.\n\nAnonymous-branded videos announcing the action had begun to appear in March and got hundreds of thousands of views. Momentum seemed to be building. When the day came, though, only sixteen people arrived at Chase Manhattan Plaza, where the march to Zuccotti was to commence, and of the sixteen only four intended to occupy.\n\nUndeterred, Roland decided to join another occupation that was beginning the same day near City Hall, a few blocks north. Organized by a coalition called New Yorkers against Budget Cuts, the so-called Bloombergville occupation would turn into a three-week stand against the city\u2019s austerity budget. It didn\u2019t seem to amount to much on its own, but it eventually proved to be another step building toward something that would.\n\n\u201cThe attention we were able to get online,\u201d David DeGraw wrote after the flop on June 14, \u201cobviously doesn\u2019t translate into action.\u201d Consoling himself with the thought that the attempt was at least spreading awareness, he started talking about trying again on September 10, a date chosen in deference to the Anonymous convention of operating in three-month cycles.\n\nMore simultaneity, more synchronicity: September 10 was also the day on which a completely separate mass action was slated to happen in Washington. Seize DC, as it was called, came from a small organization called Citizens for Legitimate Government, which had experienced a period of some prominence during the Bush years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking of this as a guerrilla protest,\u201d CLG\u2019s Michael Rectenwald told me on a park bench in Washington Square Park. (In addition to being the group\u2019s founder, chair, and \u201cchief editorialist,\u201d he is a professor at New York University who writes about nineteenth-century working-class intellectuals.) The goal was to mount a protest against wars abroad and corporate control at home, beginning on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks but possibly continuing much longer. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get the maximum impact for the numbers we have,\u201d Rectenwald said. The details would be worked out more or less on the fly.\n\nNumbers, however, were again the problem. CLG had called for Seize DC on its seventy-five-thousand-member e-mail list, but by late August it was clear that a turnout of even a thousand wasn\u2019t likely. This, too, had to be put on hold.\n\nThe call that came on July 13 from Adbusters was just one more among the others. Like OpESR and Seize DC, its prospects were entrusted to the Internet. The name was in the idiom of a Twitter hashtag: #OCCUPYWALLSTREET. Accompanying that was an image of a ballerina posed atop the Financial District\u2019s Charging Bull statue, with police in riot gear partly obscured by tear gas in the background. Red letters at the top asked, \u201cWHAT IS OUR ONE DEMAND?\u201d At the bottom, in white, it said \u201cSEPTEMBER 17TH\u201d\u2014the birthday of Adbusters founder Kalle Lasn\u2019s mother\u2014and \u201cBRING TENT.\u201d The image appeared as a centerfold in an issue titled \u201cpostanarchism,\u201d which also included an article by David Graeber. With that, more or less, the magazine\u2019s logistical guidance ended.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to play is a more philosophical role,\u201d Adbusters\u2019s twenty-nine-year-old senior editor, Micah White, told me in August. Not dirtying their hands with organizing became just part of the aesthetic, part of the mystique.\n\nAlmost at once, Twitter accounts, Facebook pages, and Internet Relay Chat channels started appearing and connecting. \u201c#OCCUPYWALLSTREET goes viral,\u201d Adbusters announced in a \u201cTactical Briefing\u201d e-mail on July 26. The following day, Alexa O\u2019Brien\u2019s US Day of Rage declared its support for the occupation. O\u2019Brien and the colleagues she\u2019d found online were organizing actions on September 17 in Los Angeles, Portland, Austin, Seattle, and San Francisco, in addition to Wall Street. Her press releases and tweets became so ubiquitous that people started referring to #OCCUPYWALLSTREET and US Day of Rage interchangeably.\n\nI first heard about the idea of occupying Wall Street while attending the planning meetings of yet another group that, since April, had been planning another indefinitely long occupation of a symbolic public space. In late July I attended one of its meetings, around a conference table in an office above Broadway shared by a handful of New York activist organizations. Those present, both in person and over video-chat, included some of the hardiest survivors of Bush-era dissent. They were mostly middle-aged, frustrated, and ready for a breakthrough. This October 2011 Coalition intended to set up camp at Freedom Plaza in Washington DC starting on October 6, in time for the tenth anniversary of the war in Afghanistan. \u201cStop the machine!\u201d went their slogan, \u201cCreate a new world!\u201d\nIn early August, Al Gore told TV commentator Keith Olbermann, \u201cWe need to have an American Spring.\u201d But people all over the country were already fumbling toward an American Autumn.\n\n* * *\n\nWhat, if anything, the hubbub online actually amounted to remained opaque. \u201cWe are not a political party,\u201d Alexa O\u2019Brien told me when I asked her about the nature of US Day of Rage in mid-August. \u201cWe are an idea.\u201d Here\u2019s how she described its genesis, out of the inspiration of the Arab Spring:I felt that something needed to be done to help people have a space where they could discuss these issues and their self-interest without ideological talking points. I asked them to list their grievances on a hashtag\u2014US Day of Rage asked people to list their grievances. Originally we were going to put them into columns. But what ended up happening is we realized that most of the grievances, whether on the left or the right, could be linked to corrupt elections. So we decided to keep it really simple. We need to reform our elections.The idea that emerged out of these discussions on social media was an especially drastic kind of campaign finance reform: \u201cOne citizen. One dollar. One vote.\u201d\n\nShe went on:I wouldn\u2019t even call myself an activist. I\u2019m a normal nobody. I\u2019m a nobody. I always say that. For me, this is an avocation. It\u2019s an idea of service to my country, to my community, and to other people. In the beginning it was me, but I have to say \u201cwe,\u201d because there was the hashtag as well. And it\u2019s not me. In the beginning we had the hashtag, and we had a Facebook page. And what we did was we built a platform.The platform also had a theme song, which appeared on the website in the form of an embedded YouTube video: the theme from the 1970s show Free to Be .\u00a0.\u00a0. You and Me.\n\nOn August 23, an Adbusters e-mail featured a video of Anonymous\u2019s headless-man logo and a computerized voice declaring support for Occupy Wall Street. Soon there were rumors that the Department of Homeland Security had issued a warning about September 17 and Anonymous; Anonymous bombarded mainstream news outlets with tweets demanding that they cover the story.\n\nMicah White:I see stuff on Twitter from people saying that we had interaction and then we cut off communication, but we never had any. I never communicated with Anonymous.Alexa O\u2019Brien:They [Homeland Security] believe that we are high-level Anonymous members, which is really a joke.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. We have had no contact with Anonymous. And that\u2019s the honest truth.An occupation, by definition, has to start with people physically present. Social media, even with whatever aid and cachet Anonymous might lend, isn\u2019t enough\u2014witness the failure of OpESR. Until August 2, when the NYC General Assembly began to meet near the Charging Bull statue at Bowling Green, #OCCUPYWALLSTREET was still just a hashtag.\n\nThat first meeting was hosted by the coalition behind Bloombergville, New Yorkers against Budget Cuts, which had exchanged e-mails with Adbusters. Others learned about the assembly at a report-back from anti-austerity movements around the world at the nearby 16 Beaver Street art space on July 31. What was advertised as an open assembly began like a rally, with Workers World Party members and those of other groups making speeches over a portable PA system to the hundred or so people there. But the anarchists started to heckle the socialists, and the socialists heckled back. The meeting melted down. Here\u2019s how one participant, Jeremy Bold, described what took place in an e-mail the next day:[A] few participants were adamantly opposed to the initial speak-out sessions being voiced through the loudspeaker, proclaiming that it was \u201cnot a general assembly\u201d and demanding that a more open GA be created. Though organizers quickly shifted to the general assembly structure for the meeting, maintaining use of the loudspeaker caused the opposed participants to organize their own assembly, causing a brief bifurcation in the group: one group utilizing the GA structure of an open floor but maintaining the loudspeaker to contend with the traffic noise, the other group seating themselves in a circle closer to Bowling Green park. The breakaway faction had objected to the format because it appeared to function more like a rally than a GA and expressed concerns about being forced to speak under a particular political party or viewpoint[, and the breakaway faction] voiced this criticism; as they broke off to begin the GA, participants were stuck between the two groups. As the power began to die from the loudspeaker, the group voted by simple majority to move to the traditional GA and joined the circle, in which the GA was already under way.Those who stuck around got what the anarchists wanted, and perhaps more: a leaderless assembly, microphone-free and in a circle, that dragged the 4:30 P.M. event on until 8:30, with some people staying around to talk until eleven o\u2019clock. They started using the language of the 1 percent versus the other 99\u2014independently, it seems, of David DeGraw and A99. Working groups formed to do outreach, to produce media, to provide food.\n\nDespite the presence of people from various contingents of the sectarian left who made their affiliations known with T-shirts and specialized rhetoric, none of these groups could dominate the NYC General Assembly. New York\u2019s activists at that point were splintered and frustrated, and no one group could do much of anything on its own. One of them with a considerable role, the invitation-only Organization for a Free Society, was not the kind to announce its presence, and its members seemed to operate as individuals, not as representatives of a bloc. Even the anarchists, who set the format of the GA and furnished some of its more influential interventions, were in no position to run the show entirely. David Graeber told me,The anarchist scene in New York had been very fragmented. The insurrectionists versus the SDS people\u2014there\u2019d been all these splits. It had become a little dysfunctional. The New York scene was fucked up, to be perfectly honest.Describing the makeup of the GA, Graeber continued:\n\nThere was one fairly small crew\u2014capital-A insurrectionary anarchists, they were there. But there was mainly what I like to call the small-a anarchists, people like myself.I couldn\u2019t tell you what kind of anarchist I am. I don\u2019t feel any need to work in groups that are made up exclusively or mainly of anarchists, as long as they operate on anarchist principles. I see anarchism more as a way of doing things, a broad series of ethical commitments and principles, rather than an ideology. So people like that, there were a lot of them.In lieu of anything else, small-a anarchy was an acceptable enough common denominator for the anarchists and everyone else. On that basis, the General Assembly would continue to meet about once a week.\n\nThe second meeting I attended was on August 20, the fourth in all. It was relatively productive at first, even if short on consensus. The group didn\u2019t, for instance, make any outright commitment to nonviolence, largely because they couldn\u2019t agree on what it would mean to do so. No text for the Outreach Committee\u2019s fliers could be passed. But people wiggled their fingers in the air when they liked what was being said and wiggled them down at the ground when they didn\u2019t, so through these discussions everyone got to know one another a little better.\n\nSoon, even that modicum of process started to fail. Georgia Sagri, a performance artist from Greece, paced around the periphery of the circle with a large cup of coffee in her hand, making interjections whether or not she was \u201con stack\u201d to speak. She seemed less interested in planning an occupation than in the planning meeting itself. \u201cWe are not just here for one action,\u201d she declared. \u201cThis is an action. We are producing a new reality!\u201d The pitch of her voice rose and then fell with every slogan. \u201cWe are not an organization; we are an environment!\u201d\n\nGeorgia\u2019s powers of persuasion and disruption were especially on display when the discussion turned to the Internet Committee. Drew Hornbein, a red-haired, wispy-bearded web designer, had started putting together a site for the General Assembly. Georgia thought he was doing it all wrong. She didn\u2019t trust the security of the server he was using\u2014not that she knew much about servers\u2014and wanted to stop depending on Google for the e-mail group. Her concern was principle, while his was expediency.\n\nAs Georgia and her allies denounced Drew publicly, he apologized as much as he could, but then he eventually got up and left the circle with others who\u2019d also had enough. \u201cI\u2019m talking about freedom and respect!\u201d Georgia cried. \u201cThis is not bullshit!\u201d\n\nShe continued to hold the floor, proposing every detail of what the website would say and how it would look, reading one item at a time from her phone and insisting that the General Assembly approve it. The facilitators seemed exasperated. A passerby began playing Duck, Duck, Goose on the shoulders of those sitting under the Hare Krishna Tree.\n\nThe thrill I\u2019d felt the previous Saturday turned to pretty thoroughgoing disappointment. I abandoned my reportorial post: I left early, after three and a half hours.\n\nOn the way out, I ran into a couple I knew from the October 2011 Coalition, Ellen Davidson and Tarak Kauff, who were just arriving from another gathering in Harlem. They had met each other at protests over the past few years, in jail after an action at the Supreme Court in DC, and in Cairo during a mobilization against Israel\u2019s blockade of the Gaza Strip. I updated Tarak\u2014who had served in the army in the early 1960s and could still do a hundred push-ups\u2014on what had been going on. None of it appeared to surprise or trouble him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really, really hard,\u201d he said in his Queens accent, as the Internet Committee proposals ground through consensus a few steps away. \u201cThey\u2019re doing fine.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nMicah White of Adbusters said, when I called him on August 12:The worst outcome would be to get there and they just fumble it by doing this whole lefty game we always play, which is self-defeatist. We go there, make some unreasonable demand, like, we want to abolish capitalism and we won\u2019t leave until we do. And well, that\u2019s like the war on terrorism; that\u2019s an impossible dream. Or they just squander it by being some hipster, anarchist insurrection like, we\u2019re gonna smash some stores and make a spectacle. And everyone\u2019s like, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nBecause we have something beautiful going here. So we\u2019re trying to rise above the sectarian clashings of whether or not US Day of Rage is tweeting too much or whether or not the libertarians are\u2014you know? And reach out to the Tea Party too. This is a moment for all of America.\n\nI don\u2019t see why this has to be a lefty moment or a righty moment, because this is a moment for us to reinvent democracy in America, because it\u2019s getting to be too late. If we don\u2019t do it now, we are reaching the end.* * *\n\nIn the NYC General Assembly, as well as on the Internet, the idea of \u201cone demand\u201d that Adbusters had promulgated was a topic of perpetual discussion. Some of the proposals that were being suggested:Impose a Tobin tax (or a \u201cRobin Hood tax\u201d) on financial transactions, a popular proposition among some economists for simultaneously bringing the most speculative markets a bit more under control while generating revenue for social programs. This idea was described in one of the planning GAs on a photocopied sheet of paper signed under the activist pen name \u201cLuther Blissett.\u201dRestore the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which was repealed by Bill Clinton in 1999. It prevented investment banks from gambling with money deposited in their commercial affiliates, putting a further brake on speculation and lessening the public\u2019s exposure to the banks\u2019 risk.Overturn the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision, which massively deregulated the campaign finance system.Demand universal employment in New York, with the accompanying socialist mantra \u201cA job is a right!\u201d\u201cEnd the Fed.\u201d The various libertarian contingents (and fans of the online documentary sensation Zeitgeist) were especially insistent on this proposal for the abolition of the Federal Reserve.\u201cEnd the wars, tax the rich.\u201d This slogan of the anti-war movement tended to come from older voices, and it figured prominently in the October 2011 Coalition.\n\nNone of these was to win out. \u201cOne demand is dangerous,\u201d I remember someone saying in Tompkins Square Park. \u201cThis is for the long haul.\u201d Another added, \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m not asking anything of Wall Street.\u201d And another: \u201cOnce you get pigeonholed into one demand, it becomes easy to be just about winning or losing.\u201d\n\nAt first the \u201cone demand\u201d was simply hard to agree on. But gradually its absence seemed to make more and more sense.\n\n* * *\n\nThe August 27 GA meeting didn\u2019t happen because there was a hurricane that weekend\u2014weird for New York City, just like the earthquake a few days earlier. I missed the following weekend\u2019s meeting because I went to the October 2011 Coalition\u2019s retreat at Ellen and Tarak\u2019s house up in Woodstock, where a dozen organizers holed up for two nights and a long day of planning the DC occupation. They were eating well, singing protest songs, and debating the theories of Gene Sharp, the scholar who from his home office in Boston helped inspire revolutions as far away as Serbia and Egypt. Everyone in the group came with some deep well of experience\u2014a Ralph Nader presidential campaign manager, leaders of major antiwar groups, and the gruff Veterans for Peace, whose youthfulness returned to them with any talk of tactics. After decades of trying leaderless activism, they affirmed to one another that identifying leaders is really okay. It was conspicuous that only the very youngest\u2014a sober-minded, thirty-eight-year-old Israeli who managed their website\u2014had any real Internet expertise.\n\nThe goal of the occupation was to create a space for people to come into their own, explained Margaret Flowers, a pediatrician and a mother of three teenagers, who became radicalized while fighting for single-payer health care. She was among those who first conceived of the plan for October 6, but Margaret and the other organizers realized that the moment they succeeded\u2014if they did, by some definition of the word\u2014would be the moment they\u2019d have to let go and let this take a life of its own.\n\n\u201cI just think of how I raised my children,\u201d she said.\n\nThe organizers gathered in the living room the first night, after dinner on the screened-in porch out back, for a meeting over Skype with a guru-type old man in Santa Cruz. His expertise was in a technique for \u201cgrounding\u201d oneself with chi\u2014or energy, or qigong, or the earth, or plain love\u2014by pointing one\u2019s attention to the ground underneath and feeling oneself as connected to it. For too long, they put up with him explaining all this as strange women strolled by in the background, occasionally pausing to look at the camera or to stand in as demonstration subjects when he attempted to explain just what he was talking about and what it had to do with revolution. Tarak fell asleep in his chair as it became clear that the guy was quite pathetically just in search of a market, a spot on the website, and access to a huge crowd so he could jizz his metaphysics on them and make a buck in the process. For the rest of the retreat they\u2019d joke about this\u2014\u201cAre you grounded?\u201d But a few weeks later, standing again and again before columns of angry cops, I\u2019ve got to say that I fell back on what little I\u2019d gleaned of his technique.\n\nThe rest of the retreat was far more reasonable. Sketching notes on giant sheets of paper on an easel, the organizers set out to assess what their protomovement was up against and what its strengths and weaknesses were. While debate about the \u201cone demand\u201d had come to an impasse in Tompkins Square Park, this group decided much more methodically not to state proscriptions at the outset. For months already, they had been developing a fifteen-point set of demands on issues ranging from military spending to public transportation, but now they started thinking that the group wasn\u2019t strong enough\u2014not yet\u2014to make such demands heard. They concluded from their discussion of Gene Sharp that there was no point in making a demand until they were in a position to force the system to accept it. Instead, their goal would be to host an open conversation at their occupation in the capital, to spread a culture of resistance to the illegitimate politics of Washington. Given where they were at the time, the first priority was to claim that space, cause a disruption, and grow.\n\nThe concluding topic of the retreat, after Goals and Strategy and Tactics were settled, was Message. Over wine that Saturday night, the group tripped and turned over words until finally landing on something that would let them go to bed satisfied: \u201cIt Starts Here.\u201d The slogan, however, was destined for obsolescence; by the time they pitched their tents in October, they would seem like latecomers.\n\n* * *\n\nReports about the planned occupation of Wall Street trickled out slowly online, and consequently they betrayed the biases of the Internet: much discussion of Adbusters, US Day of Rage, and Anonymous, but hardly anything about the General Assembly\u2014which, despite not having an active website, still constituted the closest thing to a guaranteed turnout on September 17.\n\nAmong the most prolific early chroniclers was Aaron Klein of the right-wing website WorldNetDaily. His articles claimed that September 17 could bring \u201cBritain-style riots,\u201d that \u201cDay of Rage\u201d was a reference to the terrorism of the Weather Underground, and that the billionaire George Soros\u2014who else?\u2014was behind it all. Because Stephen Lerner of the Service Employees International Union had been murmuring about wanting to see an uprising against banks, Klein concluded that the union was involved, together with the remnants of ACORN. None of it was true; when people from the General Assembly tried to reach out to unions and the like, none wanted to touch the idea of an occupation with a ten-foot pole. But Klein thought he saw exactly the kind of vast left-wing conspiracy he had been outlining in his book, Red Army: The Radical Network That Must Be Defeated to Save America, which was scheduled for release in October. Before most Americans had heard of #OCCUPYWALLSTREET, Klein\u2019s gumshoeing inspired a new fund-raising and lobbying campaign from the conservative AmeriPAC: \u201cOn September 17th,\u201d the title of one solicitation warned, \u201cSocialists Will Riot Like Egyptians in All Fifty States.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nMy next chance to go to an NYC General Assembly meeting was on September 10, a week before the date Adbusters had named. The facilitators this time were especially expert\u2014impatient with off-topic speeches and creative with synthesizing what was said into passable proposals. Things got done. But really, most of the work was already being handled by the various formal and informal committees that had grown out of the General Assembly. I was learning that the point of a consensus process like this is often less to make decisions than to hear one another out; individuals and subgroups can then act autonomously, respecting the assembly while sparing it the burden of micromanagement.\n\nOn September 1, nine people had been arrested while attempting to sleep legally on the sidewalk of Wall Street as a \u201ctest run,\u201d and a video of it was getting traction online. A student group was rehearsing a flash mob to Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller.\u201d The Food Committee had raised eight hundred dollars\u2014the only funding that I heard mentioned\u2014which was about a quarter of the goal for supplying water and peanut butter sandwiches. The National Lawyers Guild would be sending observers in green caps. More than any one plan, there were plans.\n\nI didn\u2019t see Georgia Sagri there on September 10. Gary Roland showed up with an actress he\u2019d met at Bloombergville; they had gone on a bike trip around the country but then decided to come back to see what would happen on the 17th. There was enough of a crowd that the facilitators had to demonstrate the \u201cpeople\u2019s microphone,\u201d which would become a hallmark of the movement: the speaker addresses the audience in short phrases, and those who can hear repeat them in turn for the benefit of those who can\u2019t. Less can be said that way, and less quickly, but more actually tends to be heard.\n\nIn the three weeks since the previous GA meeting I had attended, the mess had congealed into common wisdom. Frustrations were past, folded into the present, and turned into lessons. Some of these planners would later be accused of belonging to a secret leadership cabal behind the leaderless movement; if they were, it was the result of nothing more mysterious than having come to know and trust one another after a month and a half of arguing, digressing, and, occasionally, consensing.\n\nThe Tactics Committee gave its report. An occupation right in front of the Stock Exchange seemed unfeasible and overly vulnerable. The previous week, the GA had decided to convene an assembly on September 17 at Chase Manhattan Plaza. The committee was coming up with contingencies, and contingencies for contingencies, in case that plan didn\u2019t work. In all likelihood there would be a legal encampment along sidewalks, which many had done during Bloombergville. Despite Adbusters\u2019s initial suggestion to \u201cbring tent\u201d and the rapper Lupe Fiasco\u2019s promise to donate fifty of them, tents would probably be too risky\u2014though it all depended on how many people would be there and what those people would be willing to do. As in Cairo and Madrid, the encampment would have to form itself.\n\nKeeping tactics loose might also be safer. Everyone assumed there were cops in the group\u2014I, for one, had my short list of suspects\u2014and the less you plan ahead, the less they can plan for you.\n\nBy this point, the idea of making a single demand had completely fallen out of fashion. After a month and a half of meetings, those in the General Assembly were getting addicted to listening to one another and being heard. Rather than discussing the Glass-Steagall Act or campaign-finance reform, they were talking about making assemblies like this one spread, around the city and around the country. The process of bottom-up direct democracy would be the occupation\u2019s chief message at first, not some call for legislation to be passed from on high. They\u2019d figure out the rest from there.\n\nI was still wrapping my head around this. Everyone was. This was a kind of politics most had never quite experienced, a kind apparently necessary even if its consequences seemed eternally obscure.\n\nDrew Hornbein, who\u2019d almost left the movement after how he\u2019d been treated at the meeting three weeks earlier, was back. \u201cWhat\u2019s really keeping me in this is the idea of a general assembly, of the horizontal power structure and decision making,\u201d he said. Mike Andrews\u2014a tall, well-muscled book editor who usually spoke for the Tactics Committee\u2014told me about how he felt after being at a GA meeting:It pushes you toward being more respectful of the people there. Even after General Assembly ends I find myself being very attentive in situations where I\u2019m not normally so attentive. So if I go get some food after General Assembly, I find myself being very polite to the person I\u2019m ordering from, and listening if they talk back to me.Maybe assemblies like this could even become a new basis for organizing political power on a larger scale. Of course, in the months to come this would be exactly what happened; as the call to occupy spread, assemblies followed. From Boston to Oakland to Missoula, Montana, activists wiggled fingers in horizontally structured meetings, using a common language to discuss problems both local and global\u2014just as was hoped for, just as was planned. But the fact that there was a plan doesn\u2019t mean that the plan was complete, or reassuring, or guaranteed to have the intended effect.\n\nA spree of decisions passed by consensus the night of September 10. There would be no appointed marshals or police negotiators; if the police wanted to negotiate, it would have to be with the whole assembly. The General Assembly would start on the 17th at three o\u2019clock\u2014\u201cand if we\u2019re in jail we start it there.\u201d A few rebellious minutes after ten, when the park was supposed to be closed, the meeting ended, and we huddled around tables at Odessa, a nearby diner, for drinks.\n\nThroughout the week before September 17, there were committee meetings, civil-disobedience training sessions, and warm-ups. People from all over started sending pictures of themselves holding signs with their grievances against Wall Street, which were posted at wearethe99percent.tumblr.com. When the Arts & Culture Committee put on midday yoga classes and speak-outs in front of the Stock Exchange, onlookers were baffled, but that didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so liberated, so free!\u201d one of the planners told me, a Brazilian doctor studying for a master\u2019s in public health. He was carrying around with him a hefty copy of Peter Kropotkin\u2019s Mutual Aid.\n\nAlso in front of the Stock Exchange one of those days was a man in a giant white no. 4 lottery ball suit with an Uncle Sam hat on top that said \u201cJUSTICE.\u201d The suit, he told me, had been created for a business of his then in litigation. Next to him his colleague held a sign that said \u201cPlease Re-Elect PRESIDENT OBAMA Or The little guy Has No Chance.\u201d I asked if they were involved in occupying Wall Street, and they informed me they weren\u2019t. For them, the choice of location was a practical matter.\n\n\u201cWe were at Times Square once,\u201d the man with the sign said. \u201cIt was just too crowded.\u201d\n\nThat week, too, Anonymous threatened a fearsome attack on bank websites. And more. No one could know everything that was happening, much less whether it would work.\n\n\u201cMaybe the General Assembly has been the really big central planner, but I don\u2019t know,\u201d Drew Hornbein told me that week over lunch. \u201cThere might be a lot of other stuff going on.\u201d I mentioned the group organizing for October 6, and he asked me to send him some links. If Wall Street didn\u2019t work out he could help with that.\n\n* * *\n\nThere was a small meeting a few days before the 17th in the back of a bar in the Bed-Stuy section of Brooklyn\u2014for outreach, to talk about #OCCUPYWALLSTREET with some locals. It\u2019s a mostly black neighborhood, yet all but one of us\u2014hip-hop elder Radio Rahim\u2014was white. Still, \u201cWhat a propitious moment this is!\u201d predicted a retired schoolteacher. \u201cThis is the moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is fucking really new, this is the definition of a truly radical movement,\u201d said one of the graduate students from the General Assembly. \u201cSo, yeah, we\u2019re gonna win.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nOccupation was on my mind constantly as the date approached, but it was still a mostly secret fixation. Norman Mailer\u2019s mesmeric account of the 1967 march on Washington, Armies of the Night, was on my nightstand. I saw \u201cOCCUPY WALL STREET SEPTEMBER 17\u201d scrawled in chalk near the fountain in Washington Square Park. On the whole, though, the city\u2019s landscape seemed innocent of what was being planned for it\u2014if what was happening was really planning at all.\n\nOn September 16, the night before whatever it was was slated to begin, I opted to pass on covering a civil-disobedience training to satisfy my curiosity about an occupation-themed Critical Mass bike ride setting out from Tompkins Square Park. Online, Anonymous associated the ride with something called \u201cOperation Lighthouse.\u201d\n\nA critical mass there was not, unless you counted the police, who were stationed at every corner of the park and periodically motorcycled by to monitor the handful of bicyclists waiting in vain for more to turn up. The bicyclists accepted soup and coffee from enterprising evangelists and obtained a tepid blessing for the next day\u2019s undertaking. Rather than invite the police to form a motorcade around the group, those present decided to leave the park one at a time and reconvene downtown for a scouting mission.\n\nAfter riding into the Financial District and passing by Wall Street, I stopped in front of a boxing match two blocks south of the New York Stock Exchange. Seeping out from the Broad Street Ballroom, an inexhaustible electronic beat surged under a looping bagpipe track. Well-decorated couples and gaggles paid their forty-five dollars per person to slip through the doors and into the crowd surrounding the ring, where two sinewy fighters were bouncing back and forth, punching and kicking each other. They were following Thai-style rules, but the scene looked more like the last days of Rome. Along the back wall stood a row of Doric columns.\n\nOn the sidewalk, looking in and around, I recognized Marisa Holmes from the General Assembly meetings as she veered away from the entrance to the boxing match. She looked worried, but she usually looked worried, so it was hard to be sure. We nodded to each other knowingly, like spies, and maybe for a moment even questioned whether to acknowledge each other publicly. But we did, and we exchanged our reconnaissance.\n\nShe had just been down at Bowling Green, where a Department of Homeland Security truck was parked. Barricades surrounded the Charging Bull statue like a cage. I told her I had been up at Chase Manhattan Plaza, north of Wall Street, and it was also completely closed off. A stack of barricades sat in wait just across a narrow street. We stood in silence and watched as the fight ended, the combatants making a gesture of good sportsmanship. Marisa continued north to Wall Street, and I got on my bicycle to go home.\n\nNights in the Financial District are desolate, even ones with scattered boxing fans and police officers preparing for God-knows-what. One can feel the weight of the buildings overhead, all the more because there are so few people around to help bear the load. The buildings seemed completely different, however, while I rode home over the Manhattan Bridge. They were distant, manageable, and light. Rolling high above the East River and looking back at them, I wondered if they had any idea what was coming.10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1306508", "artist_names": "Claudine Longet", "full_title": "Hello Hello by\u00a0Claudine\u00a0Longet", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/df38a0b2dfa03ddb68ec02e65d52b50e.300x301x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/df38a0b2dfa03ddb68ec02e65d52b50e.500x502x1.jpg", "id": 1306508, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429756218, "path": "/Claudine-longet-hello-hello-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Claudine-longet-hello-hello-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/df38a0b2dfa03ddb68ec02e65d52b50e.300x301x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/df38a0b2dfa03ddb68ec02e65d52b50e.500x502x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Hello Hello", "title_with_featured": "Hello Hello", "updated_by_human_at": 1481840156, "url": "https://genius.com/Claudine-longet-hello-hello-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/343974", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/60e0847a26e5d97bd6b27e248815dcdc.249x249x1.png", "id": 343974, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/60e0847a26e5d97bd6b27e248815dcdc.249x249x1.png", "index_character": "c", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Claudine Longet", "slug": "Claudine-longet", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Claudine-longet"}, "artist": "Claudine Longet", "lyrics": "Hello Hello LyricsHello, hello\nI like your smile\nHello, hello\nShall we talk awhile\nWould you like some of my tangerine\nI know I'd never treat you mean\nNever knew how I'd meet you\nDidn't know how to greet you\nWhen I saw you look that way\nI knew I had to say hello, hello\nAlways longed to say I love you\nAlways been too high above you\nNow you're not so far away\nNow at last I can say\nHello, hello\nYou got pretty hair\nHello, hello\nCan't you tell I care\nWould you like some of my tangerine\nYou know I'd never treat you mean, oh, no\nYou know I'd never treat you meanYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1693772", "artist_names": "B.J.

Plants LyricsCHAPTER VIII.\n\nPLANTS.\n\nThat Shakespeare possessed an extensive knowledge of the history and superstitions associated with flowers is evident, from even only a slight perusal of his plays. Apart from the extensive use which he has made of these lovely objects of nature for the purpose of embellishing, or adding pathos to, passages here and there; he has also, with a master hand, interwoven many a little legend or superstition, thereby infusing an additional force into his writings. Thus we know with what effect he has made use of the willow in \"Othello,\" in that touching passage where Desdemona (iv. 3), anticipating her death, relates how her mother had a maid called Barbara\u2014\n\n\"She was in love, and he she lov\u2019d, prov\u2019d mad,\nAnd did forsake her; she had a song of willow,\nAn old thing \u2019twas, but it express\u2019d her fortune,\nAnd she died singing it. That song, to-night,\nWill not go from my mind.\"\nIn a similar manner, Shakespeare has frequently introduced the notice of flowers with a wonderful aptness, as in the case of poor Ophelia. Those, however, desirous of gaining a good insight into Shakespeare's knowledge of flowers, as illustrated by his plays, would do well to consult Mr Ellacombe's exhaustive work on the \"Plant-Lore of Shakespeare,\" a book to which we are much indebted in the following pages, as also to Mr Biesly's \"Shakspere's Garden.\"\n\nAconite. \u2014This plant from the deadly virulence of its juice, which, Mr Turner says, \"is of all poysones the most hastie poysone,\" is compared by Shakespeare to gunpowder, as in \"2 Henry IV.\" (iv. 4)\u2014\n\n\"The united vessel of their blood\nMingled with venom of suggestion\nAs, force perforce, the age will pour it in,\nShall never leak, though it do work as strong\nAs aconitum or rash gunpowder.\"\n\nIt is probably, too, alluded to in the following passage in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (v. 1), were Romeo says\u2014\n\n\"Let me have\nA dram of poison, such soon speeding geer\nAs will disperse itself through all the veins\nThat the life-weary taker may fall dead\nAnd that the trunk may be discharged of breath\nAs violently as hasty powder fired\nDoth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.\"\n\nAccording to Ovid, it derived its name from growing upon rock (Metam. vii. 419)\u2014\n\n\"Qu\u00e6, quia nascuntur dura vivacia caute,\nAgrestes aconita vocant.\"\n\nIt is probably derived from the Greek \u1f00\u03ba\u1f79\u03bd\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, without a struggle, in allusion to the intensity of its poisonous qualities. Virgil 1speaks of it, and tells us \"how the aconite deceives the wretched gatherers, because often mistaken for some harmless plant.  The ancients fabled it as the invention of Hecate, who caused the plant to spring from the foam of Cerberus, when Hercules dragged him from the gloomy regions of Pluto. Ovid pictures the stepdame as preparing a deadly potion of aconite, (Metam. i. I47)\u2014\n\"Lurida terribiles miscent aconita noverc\u0153.\"\nIn hunting the ancients poisoned their arrows with this venomous plant, as \"also when following their mortal brutal trade of slaughtering their fellow creatures. Numerous instances are on record of the fatal results through persons eating this plant. In the \"Philosophical Transactions\" (1732, vol. 38), we read of a man who was poisoned in that year, by eating some of it in a salad, instead of celery. Dr Turner mentions the case of some Frenchmen at Antwerp, who eating the shoots of this plant for masterwort, all died, with the exception of two, in forty-eight hours. The aconitum is equally pernicious to animals.\n\nAnemone.\u2014This favourite flower of early spring is probably alluded to in the following passage of \"Venus and Adonis\"\u2014\n\n\"By this, the boy that by her side lay killed\nWas melted like a vapour from her sight;\nAnd in the blood that on the ground lay spill\u2019d,\nA purple flower sprung up chequer\u2019d with white,\nResembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood\nWhich in round drops upon their whiteness stood.\"\n\nAccording to Bion, it is said to have sprung from the tears that Venus wept over the body of Adonis\u2014\n\n\"Alas, the Paphian! fair Adonis slain!\nTears plenteous as his blood she pours amain,\nBut gentle flowers are born, and bloom around,\nFrom every drop that falls upon the ground\nWhere streams his blood, there blushing springs the rose,\nAnd where a tear has dropp\u2019d a wind-flower blows.\"\n\nOther classical writers make the anemone to be the flower of Adonis. Mr Ellacombe, says that although Shakespeare does not actually name the anemone, yet the evidence is in favour of this plant. The \"purple colour,\" he adds, is no objection, for purple in Shakespeare's time had a very wide signification, meaning almost any bright colour, just as \"purpureus\" had in Latin.\n\nApple.\u2014Although Shakespeare has so frequently introduced the apple into his Plays, yet he has abstained from alluding to the extensive folk-lore associated with this favourite fruit.\n\nIndeed, beyond mentioning some of the popular nicknames by which the apple was known in his day, little is said about it. The term apple was not originally confined to the fruit now so called, but was a generic name applied to any fruit, as we still speak of the love-apple, pine-apple, &c.\"  So when Shakespeare (\"Sonnet\" xciii.), makes mention of Eve's apple, he simply means that it was some fruit that grew in Eden\u2014\n\"How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,\nIf thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.\"\n\n(a.) The \"Apple-john,\" called in France deux-ann\u00e9es or deux-ans, because it will keep two years, and considered to be in perfection when shrivelled and withered, is evidently spoken of in \"1 Henry IV.\" (iii. 3) where Falstaff says\u2014\"My skin hangs about me like an old lady's loose gown; I am withered like an old apple-john.\" In \"2 Henry IV.\" (ii. 4) there is a further. allusion\u2014\"1st Drawer. What the devil hast thou brought there? apple-johns? thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an apple-john. 2nd Drawer. Mass, thou sayest true. The prince once set a dish of apple johns before him, and told him there were five more Sir Johns, and, putting off his hat, said, 'I will now take my leave of these six dry, round, old, withered knights.'\" This apple, too, is well described by Phillips (\"Cider,\" B. i.)\u2014\n\n\"Nor John Apple, whose wither\u2019d rind, entrench\u2019d\nBy many a furrow, aptly represents\nDecrepid age.\"\n\nIn Ben Jonson's \"Bartholomew Fair\" (i. 1) where Little-wit encourages Quarlus to kiss his wife, he says, \"she may call you an apple-john if you use this.\" \"Here apple-john  evidently means a procuring John, besides the allusion to the fruit so called.\n\n(b.) The \"Bitter-sweet or sweeting\" to which Mercutio alludes in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (ii. 4)\u2014\"Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce;\" was apparently a favourite apple, which furnished many allusions to poets. Gower in his \"Confessio Amantis\" (1554, fol. 174) speaks of it\u2014\n\n\"For all such time of love is lore\nAnd like unto the bitter swete,\nFor though it thinke a man first swete,\nHe shall well felen atte laste,\nThat it is sower, and maie not laste.\"\n\nThe name is \"now given to an apple of no great value as a table fruit, but good as a cider apple, and for use in silk dyeing.\"\n(c.) The \"Crab\" roasted before the fire and put into ale was a very favourite indulgence, especially at Christmas, in days gone by, and is referred to in the song of winter in \"Love's Labour's Lost\" (v. 2)\u2014\n\n\"When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl\nThen nightly sings the staring owl.\"\n\nThe beverage thus formed was called \"Lambs-wool,\" and generally consisted of ale, nutmeg, sugar, toast, and roasted crabs, or apples. It formed the ingredient of the wassail-bowl; and also of the gossip's bowl 3 alluded to in \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" (ii. 1) where Puck says\u2014\n\n\"And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,\nIn very likeness of a roasted crab,\nAnd when she drinks, against her lips I bob\nAnd on her wither\u2019d dewlap pour the ale.\"\n\nIn Peele's \"Old Wives' Tale,\" it is said\u2014\n\n\"Lay a crab in the fire to roast for lamb's wool.\"\nAnd in Herrick's \"Poems\"\u2014\n\n\"Now crowne the bowle\nWith gentle lamb's wooll,\nAdd sugar, and nutmegs, and ginger.\"\n\n\n(d.) The \"Codling,\" spoken of by Malvolio in \"Twelfth Night,\" (i. 5), \"Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy, as a squash is before \u2019tis a peascod, or a codling when \u2019tis almost an apple,\"\u2014is not the variety now so-called, but was the popular term for an immature apple, such as would require cooking to be eaten, being derived from \"coddle,\" to stew or boil lightly,\u2014hence it denoted a boiling apple, an apple for coddling or boiling. Mr Gifford says that codling was used by our old writers for that early state of vegetation when the fruit, after shaking off the blossom, began to assume a globular and determinate form.\n\n(e). The \"Leather Coat\" was the apple generally known as \"the golden russeting.\" 3 Davy, in \"2 Henry IV,\" (v. 3), says:\u2014\"There's a dish of leather coats for you.\"\n\n(f.) The \"Pippin\" was formerly a common term for an apple, to which reference is made in \"Hudibras Redivivus,\" (1705),\u2014\n\n\"A goldsmith telling o\u2019er his cash,\nA pipping-monger selling trash.\"\n\nIn Taylor's Workes  (1630), we read:\u2014\n\n\"Lord, who would take him for a pippin squire,\nThat's so bedaub\u2019d with lace and rich attire?\"\n\nMr Ellacombe  says the word \"pippin\" denoted an apple raised from pips and not from grafts, and \"is now, and probably was in Shakespeare's time, confined to the bright-coloured long-keeping apples of which the golden pippin is the type.\" Justice Shallow, in \"2 Henry IV,\" (v. 3), says:\u2014\"Nay, you shall see my orchard, where in an arbour we will eat a last year's pippin of my own graffing.\"\n\n(g.) The \"Pomewater\" was a species of apple evidently of a juicy nature, and hence of high esteem in Shakespeare's time, for in \"Love's Labour's Lost,\" (iv. 2), Holofernes says:\u2014\"The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of c\u0153lo,\u2014the sky, the welkin, the heaven; and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,\u2014the soil, the land, the earth.\"\n\nParkinson 1 tells us the \"Pomewater is an excellent, good, and great whiteish apple, full of sap or moisture, somewhat pleasant sharp, but a little bitter withal; it will not last long, the winter's frost soon causing it to rot and perish.\n\nIt appears that apples and carraways were formerly always eaten together; and it is said that they are still served up on. particular days at Trinity College, Cambridge. This practice is probably alluded to by Justice Shallow in the much disputed passage in \"2 Henry IV.,\" (iii. 5), when he speaks of eating \"a last year's pippin, with a dish of caraways.\" The phrase, too, seems further explained by the following quotations from Cogan's \"Haven of Health,\" (1599). After stating the virtues of the seed, and some of its uses, he says:\u2014\"For the same purpose careway seeds are used to be made in comfits, and to be eaten with apples, and surely very good for that purpose, for all such things as breed wind would be eaten with other things that break wind.\" Again, in his chapter on apples, he says:\u2014\"Howbeit wee are wont to eat carrawaies or biskets, or some other kind of comfits, or seeds together with apples, thereby to breake winde ingendred by them, and surely this is a verie good way for students.\" Mr Ellacombe, however, considers that in \"the dish of carraways\" mentioned by Justice Shallow, neither caraway seeds, nor cakes made of caraways, are meant; but the carraway or carraway-russet apple. Most of the commentators are in favour of one of the former explanations. Mr Dyce reads caraways in the sense of comfits or confections made with caraway-seeds, and quotes from Shadwell's \"Woman-Captain\" the following:\u2014\"The fruit, crab-apples, sweetings, and horse-plumbs; and for confections, a few carraways in a small sawcer, as if his worship's house had been a lousie inn.\"\n\nApricot. This word, which is spelt by Shakespeare \"Apricock,\" occurs in \"Richard II.,\" (iii. 4), where the gardener says:\u2014\n\n\"Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,\nWhich, like unruly children, make their sire\nStoop with oppression of their prodigal weight.\"\n\nAnd in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (iii. i), Titania gives directions:\u2014\n\n\"Be kind and courteous to this gentleman,\nFeed him with apricocks and dewberries.\"\n\nThe spelling \"Apricock,\"  is derived from the Latin pr\u00e6cox, or pr\u00e6coquus; and it was called \"the precocious tree\" because it flowered and fruited earlier than the peach. The term \"Apricock\" is still in use in Northamptonshire.\n\nAspen,\u2014According to a medi\u00e6val legend, the perpetual motion of this tree dates from its having supplied the wood of the Cross, and that its leaves have trembled ever since at the recollection of their guilt. De Quincey in his essay on \"Modern Superstition\" says, that this belief is co-extensive with Christendom. The following verses,  after telling how other trees were passed by in the choice of wood for the Cross, describe the hewing down of the aspen, and the dragging of it from the forest to Calvary\u2014\n\n\"On the morrow stood she, trembling\nAt the awful weight she bore,\nWhen the sun in midnight blackness\nDarkened on Judea's shore.\nStill when not a breeze is stirring,\nWhen the mist sleeps on the hill,\nAnd all other trees are moveless\nStands the aspen trembling still.\"\n\nThe Germans, says Mr Henderson, have a theory of their own, embodied in a little poem, which may be thus translated:\u2014\n\n\"Once, as our Saviour walked with men below,\nHis path of mercy through a forest lay;\nAnd mark how all the drooping branches show,\nWhat homage best a silent tree may pay.\n\n\nOnly the aspen stands erect and free,\nScorning to join that voiceless worship pure;\nBut see! He casts one look upon the tree,\nStruck to the heart she trembles evermore!\"\n\nAnother legend tells us  that the aspen was said to have been the tree on which Judas hanged himself after the betrayal of his Master, and ever since its leaves have trembled with shame. Shakespeare twice alludes to the trembling of the aspen. In \"Titus Andronicus\" (ii. 4), Marcus exclaims:\u2014\n\n\"O, had the monster seen those lily hands\nTremble, like aspen leaves, upon the lute?\"\n\nAnd in \"2 Henry IV.\" (ii. 4), the hostess says:\u2014\"Feel, masters, how I shake. Yea, in very truth, do I, an \u2019twere an aspen leaf.\"\n\nBachelor's Buttons.\u2014This was a name given to several flowers, and perhaps in Shakespeare's time was more loosely applied to any flower in bud. It is now usually understood to be a double variety of ranunculus; according to others, the Lychnis Sylvestris; and in some counties it is applied to the Scabiosa Succisa.  According to Gerarde, this plant was so called from the similitude of its flowers \"to the jagged cloathe buttons, anciently worne in this kingdome.\" It was formerly supposed by country people to have some magical effect upon the fortunes of lovers. Hence, it was customary for young people to carry its flowers in their pockets, judging of their good or bad success, in proportion as these retained or lost their freshness. It is to this sort of divination that Shakespeare probably refers in \"Merry Wives of Windsor\" (iii. 2) where he makes the hostess say:\u2014\"What say you to young Master Fenton? He capers, he dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he speaks holiday, he smells April and May; he will carry \u2019t, he will carry \u2019t; \u2019tis in his buttons; he will carry \u2019t.\" Mr Warter, in one of his notes in Southey's \"Common-Place Book\" (1851, 4th series 244) says that this practice was common in his time, in Shropshire and Staffordshire. The term \"to wear bachelor's buttons,\" seems to have grown into a phrase for being unmarried.\n\nBalm.\u2014From very early times, the balm or balsam has been valued for its curative properties, and, as such, is alluded to in \"Troilus and Cressida\" (i. 1)\u2014\n\n\"But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,\nThou lay\u2019st in every gash that love hath given me\nThe knife that made it.\"\n\nIn \"3 Henry VI.\" (iv. 8) King Henry says 2\u2014\n\n\"My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds.\"\nAlcibiades, in \"Timon of Athens\" (iii. 5), says\u2014\n\n\"Is this the balsam, that the usuring senate\nPours into captains\u2019 wounds? Banishment?\"\n\nMacbeth, too, in the well-known passage (ii. 2), introduces it\u2014\n\n\"Sleep that knits up the ravell\u2019d sleave of care,\nThe death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,\nBalm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,\nChief nourisher in life's feast.\"\n\nAs the oil of consecration, it is spoken of by Richard (\"Richard II.,\" iii. 2)\u2014\n\n\"Not all the water in the rough, rude sea\nCan wash the balm off from an anointed king.\"\n\nAnd again, in \"3 Henry VI.\" (iii. 1), King Henry, when in disguise, speaks thus\u2014\n\n\"Thy place is filled, thy sceptre wrung from thee,\nThy balm wash\u2019d off wherewith thou wast anointed.\nNo bending knee will call thee C\u00e6sar now.\"\n\nThe origin of balsam, says Mr Ellacombe  \"was for a long time a secret, but it is now known to have been the produce of several gum-bearing trees, especially the pistacia lentiscus and the balsamodendron gileadense, and now, as then, the name is not strictly confined to the produce of any one plant.\"\n\nBarley.\u2014The barley broth, of which the Constable in \"Henry V.\" (iii. 5) spoke so contemptuously as the food of English soldiers, was probably beer, 1 which long before the time of Henry was so celebrated that it gave its name to the plant (barley being simply the beer-plant)\u2014\n\n\"Can sodden water,\nA drench for surrein\u2019d jades, their barley broth,\nDecoct their cold blood to such valiant heat.\"\n\nBay-tree.\u2014The withering and death of this tree were reckoned a prognostic of evil, both in ancient and modern times, a notion 2 to which Shakespeare refers in \"Richard II.\" (ii. 4)\u2014\n\n\"\u2019Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.\nThe bay-trees in our country are all wither\u2019d\"\n\n\u2014having obtained it probably from Holinshed, who says\u2014\"In this yeare, in a manner throughout all the realme of Englande, old baie trees withered.\" Lupton, in his \"Syxt Booke of Notable Things,\" mentions this as a bad omen\u2014\"Neyther falling-sickness, neyther devyll, wyll infest or hurt one in that place whereas a bay-tree is. The Romaynes call it the plant of the good angel.\"\n\nCamomile.\u2014It was formerly imagined that this plant grew the more luxuriantly for being frequently trodden or pressed down; a notion alluded to in \"1 Henry IV.\" (ii. 4), by Falstaff\u2014\"For though the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the sooner it wears.\" Nares  considers that the above was evidently written in ridicule of the following passage, in a book very fashionable in Shakespeare's day, Lyly's \"Euphues,\" of which it is a parody\u2014\"Though the camomile, the more it is trodden and pressed down, the more it spreadeth; yet the violet, the oftener it is handled and touched, the sooner it withereth and decayeth,\" &c.\n\nClover.\u2014According to Johnson, the \"honey-stalks\" in the following passage (\"Titus Andronicus,\" iv. 4), are \"clover-flowers, which contain a sweet juice.\" It is not uncommon for cattle to overcharge themselves with clover and die, hence the allusion by Tamora\u2014\n\n\"I will enchant the old Andronicus\nWith words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,\nThan baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep.\"\n\nColumbine.\u2014This was anciently termed \"a thankless flower,\" and was also emblematical of forsaken lovers. It is somewhat doubtful to what Ophelia alludes in \"Hamlet\" (iv. 5), where she seems to address the king\u2014\n\n\"There's fennel for you, and columbines.\"\nPerhaps she regarded it as symbolical of ingratitude:\n\nCrow-flowers.\u2014This name, which in Shakespeare's time was applied to the \"ragged robin,\" is now used for the buttercup. It was one of the flowers that poor Ophelia wove into her garland (\"Hamlet\" iv. 7)\u2014\n\n\"There with fantastic garlands did she come\nOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples.\"\n\nCuckoo-buds.\u2014Commentators are uncertain as to what flower Shakespeare refers in \"Love's Labour's Lost,\" (v. 2):\u2014\n\n\"When daisies pied and violets blue\nAnd lady-smocks all silver-white\nAnd cuckoo-buds of yellow hue\nDo paint the meadows with delight.\"\n\nMr Miller, in his \"Gardener's Dictionary,\" says that the flower here alluded to is the \"Ranunculus Bulbosus\"; but Mr Beisly, in his \"Shakspere's Garden,\" considers it to be the \"Ranunculus Ficaria,\" (lesser celandine), or pile-wort, as this flower appears earlier in spring, and is in bloom at the same time as the other flowers named in the song. Mr Swinfen Jervis, however, in his \"Dictionary of the Language of Shakespeare\" (1868), decides in favour of cowslips 1; and Dr Prior suggests the buds of the crowfoot. At the present day the nickname cuckoo-bud is assigned to the meadow cress (cardamine pratensis).\n\nCuckoo-Flowers.\u2014By this flower, Mr Beisly says, the ragged robin is meant, a well-known meadow and marsh plant, with rose-coloured flowers and deeply-cut narrow segments. It blossoms at the time the cuckoo comes, hence one of its names. In \"King Lear,\" (iv. 4), Cordelia narrates how:\u2014\n\n\"He was met even now\nAs mad as the vex\u2019d sea\u2014singing aloud;\nCrown\u2019d with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,\nWith burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,\nDarnel, and all the idle weeds that grow\nIn our sustaining corn.\"\n\nCypress.\u2014From the earliest times the cypress has had a mournful history, being associated with funerals and churchyards, and as such is styled by Spenser \"cypress funereal.\"\n\nIn Quarles's \"Argalus and Parthenia,\" (1726, bk. iii.), a knight is introduced whose\n\n\"Horse was black as jet, His furniture was round about beset\nWith branches slipt from the sad cypress tree.\"\n\nFormerly coffins were frequently made of cypress wood, a practice to which Shakespeare probably alludes in \"Twelfth Night,\" (ii. 4), where the clown says:\u2014\"In sad cypress let me be laid. Some, however, prefer  understanding cypress to mean \"a shroud of cyprus or cypress,\"\u2014a fine transparent stuff, similar to crape, either white or black, but more commonly the latter. Douce  thinks that the expression \"laid\"\nseems more applicable to a coffin than to a shroud, and also adds that the shroud is afterwards expressly mentioned by itself.\n\nDaffodil.\u2014The daffodil of Shakespeare is the wild daffodil which grows so abundantly in many parts of England. Perdita, in \"Winter's Tale,\" (iv. 4), mentions a little piece of weather-lore, and tells us how\u2014\n\n\"Daffodils\nThat come before the swallow dares, and take\nThe winds of March with beauty.\"\n\nAnd Autolycus in the same play (iv. 3), sings thus:\u2014\n\n\"When daffodils begin to peer,\nWith heigh! the doxy over the dale,\nWhy, then comes in the sweet o\u2019 the year.\"\n\nDarnel.\u2014This plant, like the cockle, was used in Shakespeare's day to denote any hurtful weed. Newton, in his \"Herbal to the Bible,\" says that \"under the name of cockle and darnel is comprehended all vicious, noisome, and unprofitable graine, encombring and hindering good corne.\" Thus Cordelia, in \"King Lear,\" (iv. 4), says:\u2014\n\n\"Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow\nIn our sustaining corn.\"\n\nAccording to Gerarde, \"darnel hurteth the eyes, and maketh them dim, if it happen either in corne for breade, or drinke.\" Hence, it is said, originated the old proverb, \"lolio victitare,\"\u2014applied to such as were dim-sighted. Steevens considers that Pucelle in the following passage from \"1 Henry VI.,\" (iii. 2), alludes to this property of the darnel\u2014meaning to intimate that the corn she carried with her had produced the same effect on the guards of Rouen; otherwise they would have seen through her disguise, and defeated her stratagem:\u2014\n\n\"Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?\nI think the Duke of Burgundy will fast\nBefore he'll buy again at such a rate:\n\u2019Twas full of darnel: do you like the taste?\"\n\nDate.\u2014This fruit of the palm-tree was once a common ingredient in all kinds of pastry, and some other dishes, and often supplied a pun for comedy, as for example, in \"All's Well that End's Well\" (i. 1), where Parolles says:\u2014\"Your date is better in your pie and your porridge, than in your cheek.\" And in \"Troilus and Cressida\" (i. 2):\u2014\"Ay, a minced man; and then to be baked with no date in the pye; for then the man's date's out.\"\n\nEbony.\u2014The wood of this tree was regarded as the typical emblem of darkness\u2014the tree itself, however, was unknown in this country in Shakespeare's time. It is mentioned in \"Love's Labour's Lost\" (iv. 3)\u2014\n\n\"King By heaven thy love is black as ebony,\nBiron. Is ebony like her? O wood divine!\nA wife of such wood were felicity.\"\n\nIn the same play we read of \"the ebon-coloured ink\" (i. 1), and in \"Venus and Adonis\" (948), of \"Death's Ebon Dart.\"\n\nElder.\u2014This plant whilst surrounded by an extensive folklore, has from time immemorial possessed an evil reputation, and been regarded as one of bad omen. According to a popular tradition \"Judas was hanged on an elder,\"\u2014a superstition mentioned by Biron in \"Love's Labour's Lost\" (v. 2); and also by Ben Jonson in \"Every Man Out of Humour\" (iv. 4)\u2014\"He shall be your Judas, and you shall be his elder-tree to hang on.\" In \"Piers Plowman's Vision\" (1. 593\u20136), we are told how\u2014\n\n\"Judas, he japed\nWith jewen silver,\nAnd sithen on an eller\nHanged hymselve.\"\n\nSo firmly rooted was this belief in days gone by that Sir John Mandeville tells us in his travels, which he wrote in 1364, that he was actually shown the identical tree at Jerusalem, \"And faste by is zit, the tree of Elder that Judas henge himself upon, for despeyr that he hadde when he solde and betrayed oure Lord.\" This tradition no doubt, in a great measure, helped to give it its bad fame; causing it to be spoken of as \"the stinking elder.\" Shakespeare makes it an emblem of grief. In \"Cymbeline\" (iv. 2) Arviragus says\u2014\n\n\"Grow, patience!\nAnd let the stinking elder, grief, untwine\nHis perishing root with the increasing vine.\"\n\nThe Dwarf Elder (Sambucus Ebulus) is said only to grow where blood has been shed either in battle or in murder. The Welsh call it \"Llysan gward gwyr,\" or \"plant of the blood of man.\" Shakespeare perhaps had this piece of folklore in mind when he represents Bassianus, in \"Titus and Andronicus\" (ii. 4), as killed at a pit beneath an elder tree\u2014\"This is the pit and this the elder tree.\"\n\nEryngoes.\u2014These were formerly said to be strong pro-vocatives, and as such are mentioned by Falstaff in \"Merry Wives of Windsor\" (v. 5). \"Let the sky rain potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green Sleeves, hail kissing comfits, and snow eryngoes.\" Mr Ellacombe thinks that in this passage the Globe Artichoke is meant, \"which is a near ally of the Eryngium, and was a favourite dish in Shakespeare's time.\"\n\nFennel.\u2014This was generally considered as an inflammatory herb; and to eat \"conger and fennel\" was \"to eat two high and hot things together,\" which was an act of libertinism.  Thus in \"2 Henry IV.\" (ii. 4) Falstaff says of Poins he \"eats conger and fennel.\" Mr Beisly states that fennel was used as a sauce with fish hard of digestion, being aromatic, and as the old writers term it, \"hot in the third degree.\" One of the herbs distributed by poor Ophelia in her distraction is fennel which she offers either as a cordial or as an emblem of flattery\u2014\"There's fennel for you, and columbine.\"\n\nMr Staunton, however, considers that fennel here signifies lust, while Mr Beisly thinks its reputed property of clearing the sight is alluded to. It is more probable that it denotes flattery; especially, as in Shakespeare's time, it was regarded emblematical of flattery. In this sense it is often quoted by old writers. In Greene's \"Quip for an Upstart Courtier,\" we read\u2014\"Fennell I meane for flatterers.\" In \"Phyala Lachrymarum\" 1 we find\u2014\n\n\"Nor fennel-finkle bring for flattery,\nBegot of his, and famed courtesie.\"\n\nFern.\u2014According to a curious notion fern-seed was supposed to possess the power of rendering persons invisible. Hence it was a most important object of superstition, being gathered mystically, especially on Midsummer Eve. It was believed at one time to have neither flower nor seed; the seed, which lay on the back of the leaf, being so small as to escape the detection of the. hasty observer. On this account, probably, proceeding on the fantastic doctrine of signatures, our ancestors derived the notion that those who could obtain and wear this invisible seed would be themselves invisible; a belief which is referred to in \"1 Henry IV.\" (ii. 1)\u2014\n\n\"Gadshill. We have the receipt of fern-seed, we walk invisible.\n\"Chamberlain. Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.\"\n\nThis superstition is mentioned by many old writers; a proof of its popularity in times past. It is alluded to in Beaumont and Fletcher's \"Fair Maid of the Inn\" (i. 1)\u2014\n\n\"Did you think that you had Gyges\u2019 ring?\nOr the herb that gives invisibility?\"\nAgain, in Ben Jonson's \"New Inn\" (i. 1)\u2014\n\n\"I had\nNo medicine, sir, to go invisible,\nNo fern-seed in my pocket.\"\n\nAs recently as Addison's day, we are told in the \"Tatler\" (No. 240), that \"it was impossible to walk the streets without having an advertisement thrust into your hand of a doctor who had arrived at the knowledge of the green and red dragon, and had discovered the female fern-seed.\"\n\nFig\u2014Formerly the term fig served as a common expression of contempt, and was used to denote a thing of the least importance. Hence the popular phrase, \"not to care a fig for one;\" a sense in which it is sometimes used by Shakespeare, who makes Pistol say, in \"Merry Wives of Windsor\" (i. 3), \"a fico for the phrase;\" and in \"Henry V.\" (iii. 6), Pistol exclaims, \"figo for thy friendship.\" In \"Othello\" (i. 3), Iago says, \"Virtue! a fig.\"\n\nThe term, \"to give or make the fig,\" as an expression of insult, has for many ages been very prevalent among the nations of Europe, and according to Douce was known to the Romans. It consists in thrusting the thumb between two of the closed fingers, or into the mouth, a practice, as some say, in allusion to a contemptuous punishment inflicted on the Milanese, by the Emperor Frederic Barbarossa in 1162, when he took their city. This, however, is altogether improbable, the real origin no doubt being a coarse w representation of a disease, to which the name of ficus or fig has always been given.\n\nThe \"fig of Spain\" spoken of in \"Henry V.\" (iii. 6), may either allude to the poisoned fig employed in Spain as a secret way of destroying an obnoxious person, as in Webster's \"White Devil\" \u2014\n\n\"I do look now for a Spanish fig, or an Italian salad, daily,\"\nAnd in Shirley's \"Brothers\" \u2014\n\n\"I must poison him; One fig sends him to Erebus.\"\n\n\nIt may, as Mr Dyce remarks, simply denote contempt or insult in the sense already mentioned.\n\nFlower-de-luce.\u2014The common purple iris which adorns our gardens is now generally agreed upon as the fleur-de-luce, a corruption of fleur de Louis\u2014being spelt either fleur-de-lys or fleur-de-lis. It derives its name from Louis VII., King of France, who chose this flower as his heraldic emblem when setting forth on his crusade to the Holy Land. It had already been used by the other French kings, and by the emperors of Constantinople; but it is still a matter of dispute among antiquarians as to what it was originally intended to represent. Some say a flower, some a toad, some a halbert-head. It is uncertain as to what plant is referred to by Shakespeare when he alludes to the fleur-de-luce in the following passage 2 in \"2 Henry VI.\" (v. 1) where the Duke of York says\u2014\n\n\"A sceptre shall it have, hive I a soul,\nOn which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.\"\nIn \"1 Henry VI.\" (i. 2), Pucelle declares\u2014\n\n\"I am prepared; here is my keen edged sword,\nDeck\u2019d with five flower-de-luces on each side.\"\n\nSome think the lily is meant, others the iris. For the lily theory, says Mr Ellacombe, 3 \"there are the facts that Shakespeare calls it one of the lilies, and that the other way of spelling is fleur-de-lys.\"\n\nChaucer seems to connect it with the lily (C. T. Prol, 238)\u2014\n\n\"Her nekke was white as the flour-de-lis.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Spenser separates the lilies from the flower-de-lutes in his \"Shepherd's Calendar;\" and Ben Jonson mentions \"rich carnations, flower-de-luces, lilies.\"\n\nThe fleur-de-lis was not always confined to royalty as a badge. Thus in the square of La Pucelle, in Rouen, there is a statue of Jeanne D\u2019Arc with fleur-de-lys sculptured upon it, and an inscription as follows:\u2014\n\n\"The maiden's sword protects the royal crown;\nBeneath the maiden's sword the lilies safely blow.\"\nSt Louis conferred upon the Chateaubriands the device of a fleur-de-lis, and the motto, \"Mon sang teint les banni\u00e8rs de France.\" When Edward III. claimed the crown of France, in the year 1340, he quartered the ancient shield of France with the lions of England. It disappeared, however, from the English shield in the first year of the present century.\n\nGillifower.\u2014This was the old name for the whole class of carnations, pinks, and sweet-williams, from the French girofle, which is itself corrupted from the Latin cariophyllum. 1 The streaked gillyflowers, says Mr Beisly, 2 noticed by Perdita in \"Winter's Tale\" (iv. 4)\u2014\n\n\"The fairest flowers o\u2019 the season\nAre our carnations and streak\u2019d gillyvors,\nWhich some call nature's bastards\"\n\"are produced by the flowers of one kind being impregnated by the pollen of another kind, and this art (or law) in nature Shakspere alludes to in the delicate language used by Perdita, as well as to the practice of increasing the plants by slips.\" Tusser, in his \"Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry,\" says\u2014\n\n\"The gilloflower also the skilful doe know,\nDoth look to be covered in frost and in snow.\"\nHarebell.\u2014This flower, mentioned in \"Cymbeline\" (iv. 2), is no doubt another name for the wild hyacinth.\n\nArviragus says of Imogen\u2014\n\n\"Thou shalt not lack\nThe flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor\nThe azured harebell, like thy veins.\"\n\nHemlock.\u2014In consequence of its bad and poisonous character, this plant was considered an appropriate ingredient for witches\u2019 broth. In \"Macbeth,\" (iv. 1), we read of \"root of hemlock digg\u2019d i\u2019 the dark.\" Its scientific name, conium, is from the Greek word meaning cone or top, whose whirling motion resembles the giddiness produced on the constitution by its poisonous juice. It is by most persons supposed to be the death-drink of the Greeks, and the one by which Socrates was put to death.\n\nHerb of Grace or Herb Grace.\u2014A popular name in days gone by for rue. The origin of the term is uncertain. Most probably it arose from the extreme bitterness of the plant, which, as it had always borne the name rue (to be sorry for anything), was not unnaturally associated with repentance. It was, therefore, the herb of repentance, 1\" and this was soon changed into 'herb of grace,' repentance being the chief sign of grace.\" The expression is several times used by Shakespeare. In \"Richard II.\" (iii. 4), the gardener narrates\u2014\n\n\"Here did she fall a tear; here in this place\nI'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:\nRue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,\nIn the remembrance of a weeping queen.\"\nIn \"Hamlet\" (iv. 5), Ophelia, when addressing the queen, says, \"There's rue for you; and here's some for me: we may call it herb-grace o\u2019 Sundays: O, you must wear your rue with a difference.\" 2\n\nMalone observes that there is no ground for supposing that rue was called \"herb of grace\" from its being used in exorcisms in churches on Sunday, a notion entertained by Jeremy Taylor, who says, referring to the Flagellum D\u00e6monum, \"First, they (the Romish exorcisers) are to try the devil by holy water, incense, sulphur, rue, which from thence, as we suppose, came to be called \"herb of grace.\" 3 Rue was also a common subject of puns, from being the same word which signified sorrow or pity (see \"Richard II.\" iii. 4 cited above).\n\nHoly Thistle.\u2014The Carduus Benedictus, called also \"blessed thistle,\" was so named, like other plants which bear the specific name of \"blessed,\" from its supposed power of counteracting the effect of poison. 1 Cogan, in his \"Haven of Health,\" 1595, says, \"This herbe may worthily be called Benedictus, or Omnimorbia, that is, a salve for every sore, not known to physitians of old time, but lately revealed by the special providence of almighty God.\" It is alluded to in \"Much Ado about Nothing\" (iii. 4)\u2014\n\n\"Margaret. Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus, and lay it to your heart; it is the only thing for a qualm.\n\"Hero. There thou prickest her with a thistle.\n\"Beatrice. Benedictus! why Benedictus? You have some moral in this Benedictus.\n\"Margaret. Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning: I mean plain holy-thistle.\"\n\nInsane Root.\u2014There is much doubt as to what plant is meant by Banquo in \"Macbeth\" (i. 3)\u2014\n\n\"Have we eaten of the insane root\nThat takes the reason prisoner?\"\n\nThe origin of this passage is probably to be found in North's \"Plutarch\u2014Life of Antony,\" 1579 (p. 990), where mention is made of a plant which \"made them out of their wits.\" Several plants have been suggested\u2014the hemlock, belladonna, mandrake, henbane, &c. Douce supports the last, and cites the following passage 2:\u2014\"Henbane . . . is called insana, mad, for the use thereof is perillous; for if it be eate or dronke, it breedeth madness, or slow lykenesse of sleepe.\" Nares 3 quotes from Ben Jonson (\"Sejanus\" iii. 2), in support of hemlock\u2014\n\n\"Well, read my charms,\nAnd may they lay that hold upon thy senses\nAs thou hadst snufft up hemlock.\"\n\n\nIvy.\u2014It was formerly the general custom in England, as it is still in France and the Netherlands, to hang a bush of ivy at the door of a vintner. Hence the allusion in \"As You Like It\" (v. 4, Epilogue), where Rosalind wittingly remarks, \"If it be true that good wine needs no bush, \u2019tis true that a good play needs no epilogue.\" This custom is often referred to by our old writers, as, for instance, in Nash's \"Summer's Last Will and Testament; 1\" 1600\u2014\n\n\"Green ivy bushes at the vintner's doors.\"\nAnd in the \"Rival Friends,\" 1632\u2014\n\n\"\u2019Tis like the ivy bush unto a tavern.\"\n\nThis plant was no doubt chosen from its being sacred to Bacchus. The practice was observed at statute hirings, wakes, &c., by people who sold ale at no other time. The manner, says Mr Singer, in which they were decorated appears from a passage in Florio's \"Italian Dictionary,\" in voce trcmola, \"Gold foile, or thin leaves of gold or silver, namely, thinne plate, as our vintners adorn their bushes with.\" We may compare the old sign of \"An owl in an ivy bush,\" which perhaps denoted the union of wisdom or prudence with conviviality, as \"be merry and wise.\"\n\nKecksies.\u2014These are the dry hollow stalks of hemlock. In \"Henry V.\" (v. 2), Burgundy makes use of the word:\u2014\n\n\"And nothing teems,\nBut hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,\nLosing both beauty and utility.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that kecksies may be a mistaken form of the plural kex; and that kex may have been formed from keck, something so dry that the eater would keck at it, or be unable to swallow it. The word is probably derived from the Welsh \"cecys,\" which is applied to several plants of the umbelliferous kind. Dr Prior, however, says that kecksies is from an old English word keek, or kike, retained in the northern counties in the sense of \"peep\" or \"spy.\"\n\n\n\nKnotgrass. 1\u2014The allusion to this plant in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (iii. 2):\u2014\n\n\"Get you gone, you dwarf,\nYou minimus, of hindering knot-grass made,\nYou bead, you acorn\"\n\nrefers to its supposed power of hindering the growth of any child or animal, when taken in an infusion, a notion alluded to by Beaumont and Fletcher (\"Coxcombe\" ii. 2):\u2014\n\n\"We want a boy extremely for this function,\nKept under for a year with milk and knot-grass.\"\n\nIn \"The Knight of the Burning Pestle\" (ii. 2), we read:\u2014\"The child's a fatherless child, and say they should put him into a strait pair of gaskins, \u2019twere worse than knot-grass; he would never grow after it.\"\n\nLady Smocks.\u2014This plant is so-called from the resemblance of its white flowers to little smocks hung out to dry (\"Love's Labour's Lost\" v. 2), as they used to be at that season of the year especially:\u2014\n\n\"When daisies pied and violets blue,\nAnd lady-smocks all silver white\nAnd cuckoo buds of yellow hue\nDo paint the meadows with delight,\nWhen shepherds pipe on oaten straws,\nAnd maidens bleach their summer smocks.\"\n\nAccording to another explanation, the lady's smock is a corruption of \"Our Lady's Smock,\" so called from its first flowering about Lady-tide. This plant has also been called cuckoo-flower, because, as Gerarde says, \"it flowers in April and May when the cuckoo doth begin to sing her pleasant notes without stammering.\"\n\nLaurel.\u2014From the very earliest times this classical plant has been regarded as symbolical of victory, and used for crowns. In \"Titus Andronicus\" (i. 1), Titus says:\u2014\n\n\"Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs.\"\n\nAnd in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" (v. 3), the latter exclaims:\u2014\n\n\"Upon your sword\nSit laurelled victory.\"\n\n\nLeek.\u2014The first of March is observed by the Welsh in honour of St David, their patron saint, when, as a sign of their patriotism, they wear a leek. Much doubt exists as to the origin of this custom. According to the Welsh, it is because St David ordered his Britons to place leeks in their caps, that they might be distinguished in fight from their Saxon foes. Shakespeare in \"Henry V.\" (iv. 7), alludes to the custom when referring to the battle of Cressy. Fluellen says:\u2014\"If your majesties is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps, which your majesty know to this hour is an honourable badge of the service; and I do believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy's Day.\"  Dr Owen Pughe  supposes the custom arose from the practice of every farmer contributing his leek to the common repast when they met at the Cymmortha, an association by which they reciprocated assistance in ploughing the land. Anyhow, the subject is one involved in complete uncertainty, and the various explanations given are purely conjectural (see page 284).\n\nLily.\u2014Although so many pretty legends and romantic superstitions have. clustered round this sweet and favourite flower, yet they have escaped the notice of Shakespeare, who, whilst attaching to it the choicest epithets, has simply made it the type of elegance and beauty, and the symbol of purity and whiteness.\n\nLong Purples.\u2014This plant mentioned by Shakespeare in \"Hamlet\" (iv. 7) as forming part of the nosegay of poor Ophelia, is generally considered to be the early purple orchis (orchis mascula) which blossoms in April or May. It grows in meadows and pastures, and is about ten inches high. Tennyson (\"A Dirge\") uses the name\u2014\n\n\"Round thee blow, self-pleached deep,\nBramble roses, faint and pale,\nAnd long purples of the dale.\"\n\nAnother term applied by Shakespeare to this flower was \"Dead Men's Fingers,\" from the pale colour and hand-like shape of the palmate tubers\u2014\n\n\"Our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.\"\n\nIn \"Flowers from Stratford-on-Avon\" it is said \"there can be no doubt that the wild arum is the plant alluded to by Shakespeare,\" but there seems no authority for this statement.\n\nLove-in-Idleness, or, with more accuracy, Love-in-Idle, is one of the many nicknames of the pansy or heart\u2019s-ease\u2014a term said to be still in use in Warwickshire. It occurs in \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" (ii. 1) 2 where Oberon says\u2014\n\n\"Yet mark\u2019d I where the bolt of Cupid fell:\nIt fell upon a little western flower,\nBefore milk-white, now purple with love's wound,\nAnd maidens call it love-in-idleness.\"\n\nThe phrase literally signifies love in vain, or to no purpose, as Taylor alludes to it in the following couplet:\u2014\n\n\"When passions are let loose without a bridle,\nThen precious time is turned to love and idle.\"\n\nThat flowers, and pansies especially, were used as love-philtres, or for the object of casting a spell over people in Shakespeare's day, is shown in the passage already quoted, where Puck and Oberon amuse themselves at Titania's expense. Again, a further reference occurs (iv. 1) where the king removes the spell\u2014\n\n\"But first I will release the fairy queen.\nBe as thou wast wont to be:\nSee as thou wast wont to see:\nDian's bud  o\u2019er Cupid's flower\nHath such force and blessed power.\nNow, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.\"\n\n\"It has been suggested,\" says Mr Aldis Wright, \"that the device employed by Oberon to enchant Titania by anointing her eyelids with the juice of a flower, may have been borrowed by Shakespeare from the Spanish Romance of Diana by George of Montemayor. But apart from the difficulty which arises from the fact that no English translation of this romance is known before that published by Young in 1598, there is no necessity to suppose that Shakespeare was indebted to anyone for what must have been a familiar element in all incantations at a time when a belief in witchcraft was common.\" Percy (\"Reliques,\" iii. b. 2) quotes a receipt by the celebrated astrologer, Dr Dee, for \"an ungent to anoynt under the eyelids, and upon the eyelids eveninge and morninge, but especially when you call,\" that is, upon the fairies. It consisted of a decoction of various flowers.\n\nMandragora or Mandrake.\u2014No plant, perhaps, has had, at different times, a greater share of folk-lore attributed to it than the mandrake; partly owing probably to the fancied resemblance of its root to the human figure, and the accidental circumstance of man being the first syllable of the word. An inferior degree of animal life was assigned to it; and it was commonly supposed that, when torn from the ground, it uttered groans of so pernicious a character, that the person who committed the violence either went mad or died. In \"2 Henry VI.\" (iii. 2), Suffolk says:\u2014\n\n\"Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,\nI would invent, &c.\nAnd Juliet (iv. 3) speaks of\u2014\n\n\"Shrieks like mandrake's torn out of the earth,\nThat living mortals, hearing them, run mad.\"\n\nTo escape this danger, it was recommended to tie one end of a string to the plant and the other to a dog, upon whom the fatal groan would discharge its whole malignity. The ancients, it appears, were equally superstitious with regard to this mysterious plant, and Columella, in his directions for the site of gardens, says they may be formed where\u2014\n\n\"The mandrake's flowers\nProduce, whose root shews half a man, whose juice\nWith madness strikes.\"\n\nPliny informs us that those who dug up this plant paid particular attention to stand so that the wind was at their back; and before they began to dig, they made three circles round the plant with the point of the sword, and then proceeding to the west commenced digging it up. It seems to have been well known as an opiate in the time of Shakespeare, who makes Iago say in \"Othello,\" (iii. 3):\u2014\n\n\"Not poppy, nor mandragora.\nNor all the drowsy syrups of the world,\nShall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\nWhich you owedst yesterday.\"\n\nIn \"Antony and Cleopatra,\" (i. 5), the latter pathetically says:\u2014\n\n\"Give me to drink mandragora.\nChar. Why, madam?\nCleo. That I might sleep out this great gap of time,\nMy Antony is away.\"\n\nLyte, in his translation of \"Dodoens,\" (1578, 438), tells us that \"the leaves and fruit be also dangerous, for they cause deadly sleepe, and peevish drowsiness, like opium.\" It was sometimes regarded as an emblem of incontinence, as in \"2 Henry IV.\" (i. 2):\u2014\n\n\"Yes, lecherous as a monkey, and the whores call him mandrake.\"\n\nA very diminutive figure was, too, often compared to a mandrake. In \"2 Henry IV.\" (i. 2), Falstaff says:\u2014\n\n\"Thou whoreson mandrake, thou are fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels.\"\n\nTracing back the history of this plant into far distant times, it is generally believed that it is the same as that which the ancient Hebrews called Dudain. That these people held it in the highest esteem in the days of Jacob is evident from its having been found by Reuben, who carried the plant to his mother, and the inducement which tempted Leah to part with it, proves the value then set upon this celebrated plant. According to a curious superstition this plant was thought to possess the properties of making childless wives become mothers, and hence some suppose Rachel became so desirous of possessing the mandrakes which Reuben had found. Among the many other items of folk-lore associated with the mandrake; there is one which informs us that \"it is perpetually watched over by Satan, and if it be pulled up at certain holy times, and with certain invocations, the evil spirit will appear to do the bidding of the practitioner.\" In comparatively recent times, quacks and impostors counterfeited with the root briony figures resembling parts of the human body, which were sold to the credulous as endued with specific virtues.  The Germans, too, equally superstitious, formed little idols of the roots of the mandrake, which were regularly dressed every day, and consulted as oracles,\u2014their repute being such that they were manufactured in great numbers and sold in cases. They were, also, imported into this country during the time of Henry VIII., it being pretended that they would; with the assistance of some mystic words, increase whatever money was placed near them. In order, too, to enhance the value of these so-called miracle workers, it was said that the roots of this plant were produced from the flesh of criminals which fell from the gibbet, and that it only grew in such a situation.\n\nMarigold.\u2014This flower was a great favourite with our old writers, from a curious notion that it always opened or shut its flowers at the sun's bidding; in allusion to which Perdita remarks in \"Winter's Tale,\" (iv. 3):\u2014\n\n\"The marigold, that goes to bed wi\u2019 the sun\nAnd with him rises weeping.\"\n\n\nIt was also said, but erroneously, to turn its flowers to the sun, a quality attributed to the sunflower (helianthus annuus), and thus described by Moore:\u2014\n\n\"The sunflower turns on her god when he sets\nThe same look which she did when he rose.\"\n\nA popular name for the marigold was \"mary-bud,\" mention of which we find in \"Cymbeline,\" (ii. 3):\u2014\n\n\"Winking Mary-buds begin\nTo ope their golden eyes.\"\n\nMedlar.\u2014This fruit, which Shakespeare describes as only fit to be eaten when rotten, is applied by Lucio to a woman of loose character, as in \"Measure for Measure,\" (iv. 3):\" They would else have married me to the rotten medlar.\"\n\nChaucer, in the \"Reeve's Prologue,\" applies the same name to it\u2014\n\n\"That ilke fruit is ever lenger the wers,\nTill it be roten in mullok, or in stre.\nWe olde men, I drede, so faren we,\nTill we be roten can we not be ripe.\"\n\nMistletoe.\u2014This plant, which from the earliest times has been an object of interest to naturalists, on account of its curious growth, deriving its subsistence entirely from the branch to which it annexes itself, has been the subject of wide-spread superstition. In \"Titus Andronicus\" (ii. 3), Tamora describes it in the graphic passage below as \"the baleful mistletoe,\" an epithet which, as Mr Douce observes, is extremely appropriate either conformably to an ancient, but erroneous, opinion, that the berries of the mistletoe were poisonous; or on account of the use made of this plant by the Druids during their detestable human sacrifices.\n\nDemetrius. How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother,\nWhy doth your highness look so pale and wan?\nTamora. Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?\nThese two have \u2019tic\u2019d me hither to this place:\u2014\nA barren detested vale you see it is;\nThe trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,\nO'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:\nHere never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,\nUnless the nightly owl or fatal raven.\"\n\n\nMushroom.\u2014Besides his notice of the mushroom in the following passages, Shakespeare alludes to the fairy rings  which are formed by fungi, though, as Mr Ellacombe  points out, he probably knew little of this. In the \"Tempest\" (v. 1), Prospero says of the fairies\u2014\n\n\"You demi-puppets that\nBy moonshine do the green-sour ringlets make,\nWhereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime\nIs to make midnight mushrooms.\"\n\nthe allusion in this passage being to the superstition that sheep will not eat the grass that grows on fairy rings.\n\nMustard.\u2014Tewkesbury mustard, to which reference is made in \"2 Henry IV.\" (ii. 4), where Falstaff speaks of \"wit as thick as Tewkesbury mustard,\" was formerly very famous. Shakespeare speaks only of its thickness, but others have celebrated its pungency. Coles, writing in 1657, says:\" In Gloucestershire, about Teuxbury, they grind mustard and make it into balls, which are brought to London, and other remote places, as being the best that the world affords.\"\n\nNarcissus.\u2014The old legend attached to this flower is mentioned by Emilia in \"The Two Noble Kinsmen\" (ii. 1)\u2014\n\n\"That was a fair boy certain, but a fool,\nTo love himself; were there not maids enough.\"\n\nNutmeg.\u2014A gilt nutmeg was formerly a common gift at Christmas and on other festive occasions, a notice of which occurs in \"Love's Labour's Lost\" (v. 2), in the following dialogue \u2014\n\n\"Armado. The omnipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,\nGave Hector a gift.\nDumain.                             A gilt nutmeg.\"\n\nOak.\u2014A crown of oak was considered by the Romans worthy of the highest emulation of statesmen and warriors.\n\nTo him who had saved the life of a Roman soldier was given a crown of oak leaves; one, indeed, which was accounted more honourable than any other. In \"Coriolanus\" (ii. 1), Volumnia says\u2014\"He comes the third time home with the oaken garland.\" And again (i. 3)\u2014\"To a cruel war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.\" Montesquieu, indeed, said that it was with two or three hundred crowns of oak that Rome conquered the world. Although so much historical and legendary lore have clustered round the oak, yet scarcely any mention is made of this by Shakespeare. The legend of Herne the hunter, which seems to have been current at Windsor, is several times alluded to, as for instance in \"Merry Wives of Windsor\" (iv. 4)\u2014\n\n\"There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,\nSometime a keeper in Windsor forest,\nDoth all the winter time, at still midnight,\nWalk round about an oak, with great ragg\u2019d horns.\"\n\"Page. There want not many that do fear\nIn deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak.\"\n\nHerne's Oak, so long an object of much curiosity and enthusiasm, is now no more. According to one theory, the old tree was blown down, August 31st, 1863; and a young oak was planted by Her Majesty, September 12th, 1863, to mark the spot where Herne's oak stood.  Mr Halliwell-Phillipps, however, tells us, \"the general opinion is that it was accidentally destroyed in the year 1796, through an order of George III. to the bailiff Robinson, that all the unsightly trees in the vicinity of the castle, should be removed; an opinion confirmed by a well-established fact, that a person named Grantham, who contracted with the bailiff for the removal of the trees, fell into disgrace with the king for having included the oak in his gatherings.\"\n\nOlive.\u2014This plant ever famous from its association with the return of the dove to the oak, has been considered typical of peace. It was as an emblem of peace, that a garland of olive was given to Judith when she restored peace to the Israelites by the death of Holofernes (Judith xv. i3). It was equally honoured by Greeks and Romans. It is, too, in this sense, that Shakespeare speaks of it when he makes Viola in \"Twelfth Night\" (i. 5), say\u2014\"I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage; I hold the olive in my hand, my words are as full of peace as matter.\" In his \"Sonnet\" (cvii.), here are too those well-known lines1\u2014\n\n\"And peace proclaims olives of endless age.\"\n\nPalm.\u2014As the symbol of victory, this was carried before the conqueror in triumphal processions. Its classical use is noticed by Shakespeare in \"Coriolanus\" (v. 3). Volumnia says \u2014\n\n\"And bear the palm for having bravely shed\nThy wife and children's blood.\"\n\nIn \"Julius C\u00e6sar\" (i. 2), Cassius exclaims\u2014\n\n\"Ye gods, it doth amaze me,\nA man of such a feeble temper should\nSo get the start of the majestic world\nAnd bear the palm alone.\"\n\nPilgrims were formerly called \"palmers,\" from the staff or bough of palm they were wont to carry. So in \"All's Well That End's Well\" (iii. 5), Helena asks\u2014\n\n\"Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?\"\n\nPear.\u2014In his few notices of the pear, Shakespeare only mentions two by name, the warden and the poperin\u2014the former was chiefly used for roasting or baking, and is mentioned by the clown in the \"Winter's Tale\" (iv. 3)\u2014\n\n\"I must have saffron to colour the warden pies.\"\n\nHence, Ben Jonson makes a pun upon Church-Warden pie's. According to some antiquarians, the name warden is from the Anglo-Saxon wearden, to preserve, as it keeps for a long time; but it is more probable that the word had its origin from the horticultural skill of the Cistercian monks of Wardon Abbey, in Bedfordshire, founded in the twelfth century. Three warden pears appeared on the armorial bearings of the Abbey. It is noticeable that the warden pies of Shakespeare's day, coloured with saffron, have been replaced by stewed pears coloured with cochineal.\n\nThe Poperin.\u2014This pear was probably introduced from Flanders by the Antiquary Leland, who was made rector of Popering, by Henry VIII. It is alluded to by Mercutio in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (ii. 1), where he wishes that Romeo were \"a poperin pear.\" In the old dramas there is much attempt at wit on this pear.\n\nPeas.\u2014A practice called \"peascod wooing\" was formerly a common mode of divination in love affairs. The cook, when shelling green peas, would, if she chanced to find a pod having nine, lay it on the lintel of the kitchen door, and the first man who entered was supposed to be her future husband. Another way of divination by peascod consisted in the lover selecting one growing on the stem, snatching it away quickly, and if the good omen of the peas remaining in the husk were preserved, in then presenting it to the lady of his choice. Touchstone in \"As You Like It\" (ii. 4), alludes to this piece of popular suggestion:\u2014\"I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her.\" Gay, who has carefully chronicled many a custom of his time, says in his \"Fourth Pastoral\":\u2014\n\n\"As peascods once I pluck\u2019d, I chanc\u2019d to see,\nOne that was closely fill\u2019d with three times three,\nWhich when I cropp\u2019d I safely home convey\u2019d,\nAnd o\u2019er my door the spell in secret laid.\"\n\nWe may quote as a further illustration the following stanza from Browne's \"Pastorals\" (Bk. ii., song 3).\n\n\"The peascod greene, oft with no little toyle,\nHe\u2019d seek for in the fattest, fertil\u2019st soile,\nAnd rende it from the stalke to bring it to her,\nAnd in her bosom for acceptance wooe her.\"\n\nPlantain.\u2014The leaves of this plant were carefully valued by our forefathers for their supposed efficacy in healing wounds, &c. It was also considered as a preventive of poison. And to this supposed virtue we find an allusion in \"Romeo and Juliet\"(i. 2):\u2014\n\n\"Benvolio. Take thou some new infection to thy eye,\nAnd the rank poison of the old will die.\nRomeo. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.\nBenvolio. For what, I pray thee?\nRomeo. For your broken skin.\"\n\nIn the \"Two Noble Kinsmen\" (i. 2), Palamon says:\u2014\n\n\"These poor slight sores\nNeed not a plantain.\"\n\nPoppy.\u2014The plant referred to by Shakespeare in \"Othello\" (iii. 3), is the opium poppy, well known in his day for its deadly qualities. It is described by Spencer, \"Faerie Queene\" (ii. 7, 52), as the \"dead-sleeping poppy,\" and Drayton (\"Nymphal\" v.), enumerates it among the flowers that procure \"deadly sleeping.\"\n\nPotato.\u2014It is curious enough, says Nares  to find that excellent root which now forms a regular portion of the daily nutriment of every individual, and is the chief or entire support of multitudes in Ireland, spoken of continually as having some powerful effect upon the human frame, in exciting the desires and passions\u2014yet this is the case in all the writings contemporary with Shakespeare. Thus Falstaff in \"Merry Wives of Windsor\" (v. 5) says:\u2014\"Let the sky rain potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green Sleeves, hail kissing comfits,\" &c. In \"Troilus and Cressida\" (v. 2) Thersites adds:\u2014\"How the devil Luxury with his fat rump and potato finger, tickles these together.\"  It appears, too, that the medical writers of the times countenanced this fancy. Mr Ellacombe 4 observes that the above passages are of peculiar interest inasmuch as they contain almost the earliest notice of potatoes after their introduction into England.\n\nPrimrose.\u2014Although the early primrose has always been such a popular and favourite flower, yet it seems to have been associated with sadness, or even worse than sadness; for in the following passages the \"primrose paths,\" and \"primrose way,\" are meant to be suggestive of sinful pleasures. Thus in \"Hamlet\" (i. 3), Ophelia says:\u2014\n\n\"Like a puffed and reckless libertine,\nHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads,\nAnd recks not his own rede.\"\n\nAnd in \"Macbeth\" (ii. 3), the porter declares:\u2014\n\n\"I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire.\"\n\nCurious to say, too, Shakespeare's only epithets for this fair flower are \"pale,\" \"faint,\" \"that die unmarried.\" Nearly all the poets of that time spoke of it in the same strain, with the exception of Ben Jonson and the two Fletchers.\n\nReed\u2014Among the uses to which the reed was formerly applied were the thatching of houses, and the making of shepherds\u2019 pipes. The former is alluded to in the \"Tempest\" (v. i.):\u2014\"His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops from eaves of reeds\"; and the latter in \"Merchant of Venice\" (iii. 4), where Portia speaks of \"a reed voice.\" It has generally been regarded as the emblem of weakness, as in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" (ii. 7)\u2014\"A reed that will do me no service.\"\n\nRose.\u2014As might be expected, the rose is the flower most frequently mentioned by Shakespeare; denoting. in many cases the symbol of all that is fair and lovely. Thus, for instance, in \"Hamlet\" (iii. 4), the queen says\n\n\"Such an act . . . takes off the rose\nFrom the fair forehead of an innocent love,\nAnd sets a blister there.\"\nAnd Ophelia (iii. i), describes Hamlet as\u2014\n\n\"The expectancy and rose of the fair state.\"\n\nIn days gone by the rose entered largely into the customs and superstitions of most nations, and even now-a-days there is an extensive folklore associated with it.\n\nIt appears that in Shakspeare's time one of the fashions of the day was the wearing of enormous roses on the shoes, of which full-length portraits afford striking examples.  Hamlet (iii. 2) speaks \"of two provincial roses on his razed shoes.\"\u2014meaning, no doubt, rosettes of ribbon in the shape of roses of Provins or Provence. Douce favours the former, Warton the latter locality. In either case it was a large rose. The Province or damask rose, was probably the better known. Gerarde in his \"Herbal,\" says that the damask rose is called by some \"Rosa provincialis.\" Mr Fairholt  quotes from Friar Bacon's Prophecy, 1604, the following in allusion to this fashion:\u2014\n\n\"When roses in the gardens grew,\nAnd not in ribbons on a shoe:\nNow ribbon roses take such place\nThat garden roses want their grace.\"\n\nAgain, in King John (i. 1), where the Bastard alludes to the three-farthing silver pieces of Queen Elizabeth, which were extremely thin, and had the profile of the sovereign, with a rose on the back of her head, there doubtless is a fuller reference to the court fashion of sticking roses in the ear:\u2014\n\n\"My face so thin,\nThat in mine ear I durst not stick a rose,\nLest men should say, 'Look, where three-farthings goes.'\"\n\nShakspeare also mentions the use of the rose in rose-cakes and rose-water, the former in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (v. r), where Romeo speaks of \"old cakes of roses,\" the latter in \"Taming the Shrew\" (induction, sc. 1):\u2014\n\n\"Let one attend him with a silver basin\nFull of rose water and bestrewed with flowers.\"\n\n\nReferring to its historical lore, we may mention its famous connection with the \"Wars of the Roses.\" In the fatal dispute in the Temple Gardens, Somerset, on the part of Lancaster, says, (\"1 Henry VI.\" ii. 3):\u2014\n\n\"Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,\nBut dare maintain the party of the truth,\nPluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.\"\n\nWarwick, on the part of York, replies:\u2014\n\n\"I have no colours, and without all colour\nOf base insinuating flattery\nI pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.\"\n\nThe trailing white dog-rose is commonly considered to have been the one chosen by the house of York. A writer however, in the \"Quarterly Review\" (vol. cxiv.), has shown that the white rose has a very ancient interest for Englishmen, as, long before the brawl in the Temple Gardens, the flower had been connected with one of the most ancient names of our island. The elder Pliny, in discussing the etymology of the word Albion, suggests that the land may have been so named from the white roses which abounded in it. The York and Lancaster rose, with its pale striped flowers, is a variety of the French rose known as Rosa Gallica. It became famous when the two emblematical roses, in the persons of Henry VII. and Elizabeth of York at last brought peace and happiness to the country which had been so long divided by internal warfare. The canker rose referred to by Shakspeare is the wild dog rose, a name occasionally applied to the common red poppy.\n\nRosemary.\u2014This plant was formerly in very high esteem, and was devoted to various uses. It was supposed to strengthen the memory, hence it was regarded as a symbol of remembrance, and on this account was often given to friends. Thus, in \"Hamlet\" (iv. 5), where Ophelia seems to be addressing Laertes, she says:\u2014\n\n\"There's rosemary, that's for remembrance.\"\n\nIn the \"Winter's Tale\" (iv. 4), rosemary and rue are beautifully put together:\u2014\n\n\"For you there's rosemary and rue, these keep;\nSeeming and savour all the winter long:\nGrace and Remembrance be to you both,\nAnd welcome to our shearing.\"\n\nBesides being used at weddings, it was also in request at funerals, probably for its odour, and as a token of remembrance of the deceased. Thus the Friar in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (iv. 5) says:\u2014\n\n\"Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary\nOn this fair corse.\"\n\nThis practice is thus touchingly alluded to by Gay in his \"Pastorals\"\u2014\n\n\"To shew their love, the neighbours far and near\nFollowed with wistful look, the damsel's bier:\nSprigg\u2019d rosemary the lads and lasses bore,\nWhile dismally the parson walk\u2019d before.\"\n\nRosemary, too, was one of the evergreens with which dishes were anciently garnished during the season of Christmas, an allusion to which occurs in \"Pericles\" (iv. 6)\u2014\"Marry, come up my dish of chastity, with rosemary and bays.\"\n\nRush.\u2014Before the introduction of carpets, the floors of churches and houses were strewed with rushes, a custom to which Shakespeare makes several allusions. In \"Taming of the Shrew\" (iv. i.) Grumio asks\u2014\"Is supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept;\" and Glendower in \"1 Henry IV.\" (iii. 1) says\u2014\n\n\"She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down\nAnd rest your gentle head upon her lap.\" 1\nAt the coronation of Henry V. (\"2 Henry IV.,\" v. 5) when the procession is coming, the grooms cry, \"More rushes, more rushes,\" which seems to have been the usual cry for rushes to be scattered on a pavement or a platform when a procession was approaching. 2 Again, in \"Richard II.\" (i. 3) the custom is further alluded to by John of Gaunt, who speaks of the presence strew\u2019d,\" referring to the presence chamber. So, too, in \"Cymbeline\" (ii. 2), Iachimo soliloquizes\u2014\n\n\"Tarquin thus\nDid softly press the rushes ere he waken\u2019d\nThe chastity he wounded.\"\n\nAnd in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (i. 4) Romeo says\u2014\n\n\"Let wantons light of heart\nTickle the senseless rushes with their heels.\"\n\n\u2014an expression which Middleton has borrowed in his \"Blunt Master Constable,\" 1602\u2014\n\n\"Bid him, whose heart no sorrow feels,\nTickle the rushes with his wanton heels,\nI have too much lead at mine.\"\n\nIn the \"Two Noble Kinsmen\" (ii. 1) the gaoler's daughter is represented carrying \"strewings\" for the two prisoners\u2019 chamber.\n\nRush-bearings were a sort of rural festival, when the parishioners brought rushes to strew the church.\n\nThe \"rush-ring\" appears to have been a kind of token for plighting of troth among rustic lovers. It was afterwards vilely used, however, for mock marriages, as appears from one of the Constitutions of Salisbury. In \"All's Well that Ends Well\" (ii. 2) there seems a covert allusion to the rush-ring\u2014\n\n\"As a Tib's Rush for Tom's forefinger.\"\n\nSpenser, in the \"Shepherd's Kalendar,\" speaks of\u2014\n\n\"The knotted rush-rings and gilt Rosemarie.\"\n\nDu Breul, in his \"Antiquities of Paris,\"  mentions the rush-ring as \"a kind of espousal used in France by such persons as meant to live together in a state of concubinage; but in England it was scarcely ever practised except by designing men, for the purpose of corrupting those young women to whom they pretended love.\"\n\nThe \"rush candle,\" which in times past was found in nearly every house, and served as a night-light for the rich and candle for the poor, is mentioned in \"Taming of the Shrew\" (iv. 5)\u2014\n\n\"Be it moon or sun, or what you please:\nAn if you please to call it a rush candle,\nHenceforth I vow it shall be so for me.\"\n\nSaffron.\u2014In the following passage (\"All's Well that Ends Well,\" iv. 5) there seems to be an allusion by Lafeu to the\n\nfashionable and fantastic custom of wearing yellow, and to that of colouring paste with saffron:\u2014\"No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow, whose villanous saffron would have made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in his colour.\"\n\nSpear-grass.\u2014This plant\u2014perhaps the common reed\u2014is noticed in \"1 Henry IV.\" (ii. 4) as used for tickling the nose and making it bleed. In Lupton's \"Notable Things\" it is mentioned as part of a medical recipe\u2014\"Whoever is tormented with sciatica or the hip gout, let them take an herb called spear-grass, and stamp it and lay a little thereof upon the grief.\" Mr Ellacombe thinks that the plant alluded to is the common couch grass, (Triticum repens), which is still known in the Eastern Counties as spear-grass.\n\nStover.\u2014This word, which is often found in the writings of Shakespeare's day, denotes fodder and provision of all sorts for cattle. In Cambridgeshire, stover signifies hay made of coarse rank grass, such as even cows will not eat while it is green. In the \"Tempest\" (iv. 1) Iris says\u2014\n\n\"Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,\nAnd flat meads thatch\u2019d with stover, them to keep.\"\n\nAccording to Steevens, stover was used as a thatch for cart-lodges and other buildings that required but cheap coverings.\n\nStrawberry.\u2014Shakespeare's mention of the strawberry in connection with the nettle in \"Henry V.\" (i. 1):\u2014\n\n\"The strawberry grows underneath the nettle\nAnd wholesome berries thrive and ripen best\nNeighbour\u2019d by fruit of baser quality.\"\n\ndeserves, says Mr. Ellacombe, a passing note. \"It was the common opinion in his day that plants were affected by the neighbourhood of other plants to such an extent that they imbibed each other's virtues and faults. Thus sweet flowers were planted near fruit trees with the idea of improving the flavour of the fruit, and evil-smelling trees, like the elder, were carefully cleared away from fruit trees, lest they should be tainted. But the strawberry was supposed to be an exception to the rule, and was said to thrive in the midst of 'evil communications without being corrupted.'\"\n\nThorns.\u2014The popular tradition which represents the marks on the moon 1 to be that of a man carrying a thorn-bush on his head, is alluded to in \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" (v. 1) in the prologue: \"This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn, presenteth Moonshine.\" Little else is mentioned by Shakespeare with regard to thorns, save that they are generally used by him as the emblems of desolation and trouble.\n\nViolets.\u2014An old superstition is alluded to by Shakespeare, when he makes Laertes wish that violets may spring from the grave of Ophelia (\"Hamlet\" v. 1):\u2014\n\n\"Lay her i\u2019 the earth:\nAnd from her fair and unpolluted flesh\nMay violets spring.\"\n\nan idea which occurs in Persius's \"Satires\" (i. 39)\n\n\"\u2014E tumulo fortunataque favilla\nNascentur viol\u00e6.\"\n\nThe violet has generally been associated with early death. This, Mr Ellacombe considers 2 \"may have arisen from a sort of pity for flowers that were only allowed to see the opening year, and were cut off before the first beauty of summer had come, and so were looked upon as apt emblems of those who enjoyed the bright springtide of life and no more.\" Thus, the violet is one of the flowers which Marina carries to hang \"as a chaplet on the grave\" in \"Pericles\" (iv. 1):\u2014\n\n\"The yellows, blues,\nThe purple violets and marigolds,\nShall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,\nWhile summer-days do last.\"\n\nAgain, in that exquisite passage in the \"Winter's Tale\" (iv. 4), where Perdita enumerates the flowers of spring, she speaks of:\u2014\n\n\"Violets dim,\nBut sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes\nOr Cytherea's breath.\"\n\nUpon which Mr Singer 1 thus comments:\u2014\"The eyes of Juno were as remarkable as those of Pallas, and:\u2014\n\n\"Of a beauty never yet\nEqualled in height of tincture.\"\n\nThe beauties of Greece and other Asiatic nations tinged their eyes of an obscure violet colour, by means of some unguent, which was doubtless perfumed like those for the hair, etc., mentioned by Athen\u00e6us.\n\nWillow.\u2014From time immemorial the willow has been regarded as the symbol of sadness. Hence it was customary for those who were forsaken in love, to wear willow garlands\u2014a practice to which Shakespeare gives several allusions. In \"Othello\" (iv. 3), Desdemona, anticipating her death, says:\u2014\n\n\"My mother had a maid call\u2019d Barbara;\nShe was in love, and he she loved proved mad,\nAnd did forsake her: she had a song of willow,\nAn old thing \u2019twas, but it express\u2019d her fortune,\nAnd she died singing it: that song to-night\nWill not go from my mind.\"\n\nThe following is the song :\u2014\n\n\"The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,\nSing all a green willow;\nHer hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,\nSing willow, willow, willow:\nThe fresh streams ran by her, and murmur\u2019d her moans,\nSing willow, willow, willow;\nHer salt tears fell from her, and soften\u2019d the stones,\nSing willow, willow, willow:\nSing all a green willow must be my garland.\"\n\nAnd further on Emilia says (v. 2):\u2014\n\n\"I will play the swan,\nAnd die in music [singing], willow, willow, willow.\"\n\nAnd, again, Lorenzo, in \"Merchant of Venice\" (v. 1), narrates:\u2014\n\n\"In such a night\nStood Dido, with a willow in her hand\nUpon the wild sea-banks.\"\n\nIt was, too, in reference to this custom that Shakespeare in \"Hamlet\" (iv. 7), represented poor Ophelia hanging her flowers on the \"willow aslaunt a brook.\" \"This tree,\" says Douce \"might have been chosen as the symbol of sadness from the cxxxvii. Psalm (verse 2)\u2014'We hanged our harps upon the willows;' or else from a coincidence between the weeping-willow and falling tears.\" Another reason has been assigned. The agnus castus was supposed to promote chastity, and \"the willow being of a much like nature,\" says Swan, in his \"Speculum Mundi,\" 1635, \"it is yet a custom that he which is deprived of his love must wear a willow garland.\" Bona, the sister of the King of France, on receiving news of Edward the Fourth's marriage with Elizabeth Grey, exclaimed, \"In hope he'll prove a widower shortly, I'll wear a willow garland for his sake.\"\n\nWormwood.\u2014The use of this plant in weaning infants is alluded to in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (i. 3) by Juliet's nurse in the following passage\u2014\n\n\"For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\nWhen it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\nOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool.\"\n\nYew.\u2014This tree styled by Shakespeare \"the dismal yew\" (\"Titus and Andronicus,\" ii. 3) apart from the many superstitions associated with it, has been very frequently planted in churchyards, besides being used at funerals. Paris in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (v. 3) says\u2014\n\n\"Under yon yew trees lay thee all along,\nHolding thine ear close to the hollow ground;\nSo shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,\nBeing loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,\nBut thou shalt hear it.\"\n\n\nAlthough various reasons have been assigned for planting the yew tree in churchyards, it seems probable that the practice had a superstitious origin. As witches were supposed to exercise a powerful influence over the winds, they were believed occasionally to exert their formidable power against religious edifices. Thus Macbeth says (iv. i)\u2014\n\n\"Though you untie the winds and let them fight\nAgainst the churches.\"\n\nTo counteract, therefore, this imaginary danger, our ancestors may have planted the yew tree in their churchyards\u2014not only on account of its vitality as an evergreen, but as connected, in some way in heathen times, with the influence of evil powers. In a statute made in the latter part of Edward the First's reign, to prevent rectors from cutting down trees in churchyards, we find the following: \"Verum arbores ips\u00e6, propter ventorum impetus ne ecclesiis noceant, s\u0153pe plantantur.\"\n\nThe custom of sticking yew in the shroud is alluded to in the following song in \"Twelfth Night\" (ii. 4)\u2014\n\n\"My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,\nO, prepare it!\nMy part of death, no one so true\nDid share it.\"\n\nThrough being reckoned poisonous, it is introduced in \"Macbeth\" (iv. 1), in connection with the witches\u2014\n\n\"Gall of goat, and slips of yew\nSliver\u2019d in the moon's eclipse.\"\n\n\"How much the splitting or tearing off of the slip had to do with magic we learn from a piece of Slavonic folk-lore. It is unlucky to use for a beam, a branch, or a tree, broken by the wind. The devil, or storm spirit, claims it as his own, and, were it used, the evil spirit would haunt the house. It is a broken branch the witches choose; a sliver\u2019d slip the woodman will have none of.\"\n\nIts epithet, \"double fatal\" \"Richard II.\" (iii. 2), no doubt refers to the poisonous quality of the leaves, and on account of its wood being employed for instruments of death. Sir Stephen Scroop, when telling Richard of Bolingbroke's revolt, declares that \"the very beadsmen learn to bend their bows of double-fatal yew against thy state.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that the poison intended by the Ghost in \"Hamlet\" (i. 5), when he speaks of the juice of cursed ebenon is that of the yew, and is the same as Marlowe's \"juice of hebon\" (\"Jew of Malta,\" iii. 4). The yew is called hebon by Spenser, and by other writers of Shakespeare's age; and, in its various forms of eben, eiben, hiben, etc., this tree is so named in no less than five different European languages. From medical authorities, both of ancient and modern times, it would seem that the juice of the yew is a rapidly fatal poison; next, that the symptoms attendant upon yew poisoning correspond, in a very remarkable manner, with those which follow the bites of poisonous snakes; and lastly, that no other poison but the yew produces the \"lazar-like\" ulcerations on the body, upon which Shakespeare, in this passage, lays so much stress.\n\nAmongst the other explanations of this passage, is the well-known one which identifies \"hebenon\" with henbane. Mr Beisly suggests that nightshade may be meant, while Nares considers that ebony is meant.\n\nFrom certain ancient statutes it appears that every Englishman, while archery was practised, was obliged to keep in his house either a bow of yew or some other wood.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/134468", "artist_names": "Neal Stephenson", "full_title": "Cryptonomicon by\u00a0Neal\u00a0Stephenson", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/359ecf36015c4a0d30880d5242eee66f.275x275x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/359ecf36015c4a0d30880d5242eee66f.275x275x1.jpg", "id": 134468, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 271820, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1622734920, "path": "/Neal-stephenson-cryptonomicon-annotated", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Neal-stephenson-cryptonomicon-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/359ecf36015c4a0d30880d5242eee66f.275x275x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/359ecf36015c4a0d30880d5242eee66f.275x275x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 2, "hot": false, "pageviews": 9564}, "title": "Cryptonomicon", "title_with_featured": "Cryptonomicon", "updated_by_human_at": 1666840692, "url": "https://genius.com/Neal-stephenson-cryptonomicon-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/43884", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d2e1321ecfe1389e38f2f40337c5c870.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 43884, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d2e1321ecfe1389e38f2f40337c5c870.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "n", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Neal Stephenson", "slug": "Neal-stephenson", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Neal-stephenson"}, "artist": "Neal Stephenson", "lyrics": "Cryptonomicon LyricsPROLOGUE\n\nTwo tires fly. Two wail.\n\nA bamboo grove, all chopped down\n\nFrom it, warring songs\n\n....IS THE BEST THAT CORPORAL BOBBY SHAFTOE CAN DO ON short notice--he's standing on the running board, gripping his Springfield with one hand and the rearview mirror with the other, so counting the syllables on his fingers is out of the question. Is ``tires'' one syllable or two? How about ``wail?'' The truck finally makes up its mind not to tip over, and thuds back onto four wheels. The wail--and the moment--are lost. Bobby can still hear the coolies singing, though, and now too there's the gunlike snicking of the truck's clutch linkage as Private Wiley downshifts. Could Wiley be losing his nerve? And, in the back, under the tarps, a ton and a half of file cabinets clanking, code books slaloming, fuel spanking the tanks of Station Alpha's electrical generator. The modern world's hell on haiku writers: ``Electrical generator'' is, what, eight syllables? You couldn't even fit that onto the second line!\n\n\"Are we allowed to run over people?'' Private Wiley inquires, and then mashes the horn button before Bobby Shaftoe can answer. A Sikh policeman hurdles a night soil cart. Shaftoe's gut reaction is: Sure, what're they going to do, declare war on us? but as the highest-ranking man on this truck he's probably supposed to be using his head or something, so he doesn't blurt it out just yet. He takes stock of the situation:\nShanghai, 1645 hours, Friday, the 28th of November 1941. Bobby Shaftoe, and the other half-dozen Marines on his truck, are staring down the length of Kiukiang Road, onto which they've just made this careening high-speed turn. Cathedral's going by to the right, so that means they are, what? two blocks away from the Bund. A Yangtze River Patrol gunboat is tied up there, waiting for the stuff they've got in the back of this truck. The only real problem is that those particular two blocks are inhabited by about five million Chinese people.\n\nNow these Chinese are sophisticated urbanites, not suntanned yokels who've never seen cars before--they'll get out of your way if you drive fast and honk your horn. And indeed many of them flee to one side of the street or the other, producing the illusion that the truck its moving faster than the forty-three miles an hour shown on its speedometer.\n\nBut the bamboo grove in Bobby Shaftoe's haiku has not been added just to put a little Oriental flavor into the poem and wow the folks back home in Oconomowoc. There is a lot of heavy bamboo in front of this truck, dozens of makeshift turnpikes blocking their path to the river, for the officers of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, and of the Fourth Marines, who dreamed up this little operation forgot to take the Friday Afternoon factor into account. As Bobby Shaftoe could've explained to them, if only they'd bothered to ask a poor dumb jarhead, their route took them through the heart of the banking district. Here you've got the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank of course, City Bank, Chase Manhattan, the Bank of America, and BBME and the Agricultural Bank of China and any number of crappy little provincial banks, and several of those banks have contracts with what's left of the Chinese Government to print currency. It must be a cutthroat business because they slash costs by printing it on old newspapers, and if you know how to read Chinese, you can see last year's news stories and polo scores peeking through the colored numbers and pictures that transform these pieces of paper into legal tender.\n\nAs every chicken-peddler and rickshaw operator in Shanghai knows, the money-printing contracts stipulate that all of the bills these banks print have to be backed by such-and-such an amount of silver; i.e., anyone should be able to walk into one of those banks at the end of Kiukiang Road and slap down a pile of bills and (provided that those bills were printed by that same bank) receive actual metallic silver in exchange.\n\nNow if China weren't right in the middle of getting systematically drawn and quartered by the Empire of Nippon, it would probably send official bean counters around to keep tabs on how much silver was actually present in these banks' vaults, and it would all be quiet and orderly. But as it stands, the only thing keeping these banks honest is the other banks.\n\nHere's how they do it: during the normal course of business, lots of paper money will pass over the counters of (say) Chase Manhattan Bank. They'll take it into a back room and sort it, throwing into money boxes (a couple of feet square and a yard deep, with ropes on the four corners) all of the bills that were printed by (say) Bank of America in one, all of the City Bank bills into another. Then, on Friday afternoon they will bring in coolies. Each coolie, or pair of coolies, will of course have his great big long bamboo pole with him--a coolie without his pole is like a China Marine without his nickel-plated bayonet--and will poke their pole through the ropes on the corners of the box. Then one coolie will get underneath each end of the pole, hoisting the box into the air. They have to move in unison or else the box begins flailing around and everything gets out of whack. So as they head towards their destination--whatever bank whose name is printed on the bills in their box--they sing to each other, and plant their feet on the pavement in time to the music. The pole's pretty long, so they are that far apart, and they have to sing loud to hear each other, and of course each pair of coolies in the street is singing their own particular song, trying to drown out all of the others so that they don't get out of step.\n\nSo ten minutes before closing time on Friday afternoon, the doors of many banks burst open and numerous pairs of coolies march in singing, like the curtain-raiser on a fucking Broadway musical, slam their huge boxes of tattered currency down, and demand silver in exchange. All of the banks do this to each other. Sometimes, they'll all do it on the same Friday, particularly at times like 28 November 1941, when even a grunt like Bobby Shaftoe can understand that it's better to be holding silver than piles of old cut-up newspaper. And that is why, once the normal pedestrians and food-cart operators and furious Sikh cops have scurried out of the way, and plastered themselves up against the clubs and shops and bordellos on Kiukiang Road, Bobby Shaftoe and the other Marines on the truck still cannot even see the gunboat that is their destination, because of this horizontal forest of mighty bamboo poles. They cannot even hear the honking of their own truck horn because of the wild throbbing pentatonic cacophony of coolies singing. This ain't just your regular Friday P.M. Shanghai bank-district money-rush. This is an ultimate settling of accounts before the whole Eastern Hemisphere catches fire. The millions of promises printed on those slips of bumwad will all be kept or broken in the next ten minutes; actual pieces of silver and gold will move, or they won't. It is some kind of fiduciary Judgment Day.\n\n``Jesus Christ, I can't--'' Private Wiley hollers.\n\n\"The captain said don't stop for any reason whatsofuckinever,'' Shaftoe reminds him. He's not telling Wiley to run over the coolies, he's reminding Wiley that if he refrains from running over them, they will have some explaining to do--which will be complicated by the fact that the captain's right behind them in a car stuffed with Tommy Gun-toting China Marines. And from the way the captain's been acting about this Station Alpha thing, it's pretty clear that he already has a few preliminary strap marks on his ass, courtesy of some admiral in Pearl Harbor or even (drumroll) Marine Barracks, Eight and Eye Streets Southeast, Washington, D.C.\n\nShaftoe and the other Marines have always known Station Alpha as a mysterious claque of pencil-necked swabbies who hung out on the roof of a building in the International Settlement in a shack of knot-pocked cargo pallet planks with antennas sticking out of it every which way. If you stood there long enough you could see some of those antennas moving, zeroing in on something out to sea. Shaftoe even wrote a haiku about it:\n\nAntenna searches\n\nRetriever's nose in the wind\n\nEther's far secrets\nThis was only his second haiku ever--clearly not up to November 1941 standards--and he cringes to remember it.\n\nBut in no way did any of the Marines comprehend what a big deal Station Alpha was until today. Their job had turned out to involve wrapping a ton of equipment and several tons of paper in tarps and moving it out of doors. Then they spent Thursday tearing the shack apart, making it into a bonfire, and burning certain books and papers.\n\n``Sheeeyit!'' Private Wiley hollers. Only a few of the coolies have gotten out of the way, or even seen them. But then there is this fantastic boom from the river, like the sound of a mile-thick bamboo pole being snapped over God's knee. Half a second later there're no coolies in the street anymore--just a lot of boxes with unmanned bamboo poles teeter-tottering on them, bonging into the streets like wind-chimes. Above, a furry mushroom of grey smoke rises from the gunboat. Wiley shifts up to high gear and floors it. Shaftoe cringes against the truck's door and lowers his head, hoping that his campy Great War doughboy helmet will be good for something. Then money-boxes start to rupture and explode as the truck rams through them. Shaftoe peers up through a blizzard of notes and sees giant bamboo poles soaring and bounding and windmilling toward the waterfront.\n\nThe leaves of Shanghai:\n\nPale doorways in a steel sky.\n\nWinter has begun.\n\n\nBARRENS\n\nLet's set the existence-of-god issue aside for a later volume, and just stipulate that in some way, self-replicating organisms came into existence on this planet and immediately began trying to get rid of each other, either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves, or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored. Most of them failed, and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever, but a few found some way to survive and to propagate. After about three billion years of this sometimes zany, frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage, Godfrey Waterhouse IV was born, in Murdo, South Dakota, to Blanche, the wife of a Congregational preacher named Bunyan Waterhouse. Like every other creature on the face of the earth, Godfrey was, by birthright, a stupendous badass, albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self-replicating gizmo--which, given the number and variety of its descendants, might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time. Everyone and everything that wasn't a stupendous badass was dead.\n\n\n\nAs nightmarishly lethal, memetically programmed death-machines went, these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet. In the tradition of his namesake (the Puritan writer John Bunyan, who spent much of his life in jail, or trying to avoid it) the Rev. Waterhouse did not preach in any one place for long. The church moved him from one small town in the Dakotas to another every year or two. It is possible that Godfrey found the lifestyle more than a little alienating, for, sometime during the course of his studies at Fargo Congregational College, he bolted from the fold and, to the enduring agony of his parents, fell into worldy pursuits, and ended up, somehow, getting a Ph.D. in Classics from a small private university in Ohio. Academics being no less nomadic than Congregational preachers, he took work where he could find it. He became a Professor of Greek and Latin at Bolger Christian College (enrollment 322) in West Point, Virginia, where the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers came together to form the estuarial James, and the loathsome fumes of the big paper mill permeated every drawer, every closet, even the interior pages of books. Godfrey's young bride, nee Alice Pritchard, who had grown up following her itinerant-preacher father across the vastnesses of eastern Montana--where air smelt of snow and sage--threw up for three months. Six months later she gave birth to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.\n\n\n\nThe boy had a peculiar relationship with sound. When a fire engine passed, he was not troubled by the siren's howl or the bell's clang. But when a hornet got into the house and swung across the ceiling in a broad Lissajous, droning almost inaudibly, he cried in pain at the noise. And if he saw or smelled something that scared him, he would clap his hands over his ears.\n\n\nOne noise that troubled him not at all was the pipe organ in the chapel at Bolger Christian College. The chapel itself was nothing worth mentioning, but the organ had been endowed by the paper mill family and would have sufficed for a church four times the size. It nicely complemented the organist, a retired high school math teacher who felt that certain attributes of the Lord (violence and capriciousness in the Old Testament, majesty and triumph in the New) could be directly conveyed into the souls of the enpewed sinners through a kind of frontal sonic impregnation. That he ran the risk of blowing out the stained-glass windows was of no consequence since no one liked them anyway, and the paper mill fumes were gnawing at the interstitial lead. But after one little old lady too many staggered down the aisle after a service, reeling from tinnitus, and made a barbed comment to the minister about the exceedingly dramatic music, the organist was replaced.\n\nNevertheless, he continued to give lessons on the instrument. Students were not allowed to touch the organ until they were proficient at the piano, and when this was explained to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, he taught himself, in three weeks, how to play a Bach fugue, and signed up for organ lessons. Since he was only five years old at the time, he was unable to reach both the manuals and the pedals, and had to play standing--or rather strolling, from pedal to pedal.\n\nWhen Lawrence was twelve, the organ broke down. That paper mill family had not left any endowment for maintenance, so the math teacher decided to have a crack at it. He was in poor health and required a nimble assistant: Lawrence, who helped him open up the hood of the thing. For the first time in all those years, the boy saw what had been happening when he had been pressing those keys.\n\nFor each stop--each timbre, or type of sound, that the organ could make (viz. blockflote, trumpet, piccolo)--there was a separate row of pipes, arranged in a line from long to short. Long pipes made low notes, short high. The tops of the pipes defined a graph: not a straight line but an upward-tending curve. The organist/math teacher sat down with a few loose pipes, a pencil, and paper, and helped Lawrence figure out why. When Lawrence understood, it was as if the math teacher had suddenly played the good part of Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor on a pipe organ the size of the Spiral Nebula in Andromeda--the part where Uncle Johann dissects the architecture of the Universe in one merciless descending ever-mutating chord, as if his foot is thrusting through skidding layers of garbage until it finally strikes bedrock. In particular, the final steps of the organist's explanation were like a falcon's dive through layer after layer of pretense and illusion, thrilling or sickening or confusing depending on what you were. The heavens were riven open. Lawrence glimpsed choirs of angels ranking off into geometrical infinity.\n\nThe pipes sprouted in parallel ranks from a broad flat box of compressed air. All of the pipes for a given note--but belonging to different stops--lined up with each other along one axis. All of the pipes for a given stop--but tuned at different pitches--lined up with each other along the other, perpendicular axis. Down there in the flat box of air, then, was a mechanism that got air to the right pipes at the right times. When a key or pedal was depressed, all of the pipes capable of sounding the corresponding note would speak, as long as their stops were pulled out.\n\nMechanically, all of this was handled in a fashion that was perfectly clear, simple, and logical. Lawrence had supposed that the machine must be at least as complicated as the most intricate fugue that could be played on it. Now he had learned that a machine, simple in its design, could produce results of infinite complexity.\n\nStops were rarely used alone. They tended to be piled on top of each other in combinations that were designed to take advantage of the available harmonics (more tasty mathematics here!). Certain combinations in particular were used over and over again. Lots of blockflo[autes, in varying lengths, for the quiet Offertory, for example. The organ included an ingenious mechanism called the preset, which enabled the organist to select a particular combination of stops--stops he himself had chosen--instantly. He would punch a button and several stops would bolt out from the console, driven by pneumatic pressure, and in that instant the organ would become a different instrument with entirely new timbres.\n\nThe next summer both Lawrence and Alice, his mother, were colonized by a distant cousin--a stupendous badass of a virus. Lawrence escaped from it with an almost imperceptible tendency to drag one of his feet. Alice wound up in an iron lung. Later, unable to cough effectively, she got pneumonia and died.\n\nLawrence's father Godfrey freely confessed that he was not equal to the burdens now laid on his shoulders. He resigned from his position at the small college in Virginia and moved, with his son, to a small house in Moorhead, Minnesota, next door to where Bunyan and Blanche had settled. Later he got a job teaching at a nearby normal school.\n\nAt this point, all of the responsible adults in Lawrence's life seemed to arrive at a tacit agreement that the best way to raise him--certainly the easiest--was to leave him alone. On the rare occasions when Lawrence requested adult intervention in his life, he was usually asking questions that no one could answer. At the age of sixteen, having found nothing in the local school system to challenge him, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse went off to college. He matriculated at Iowa State College, which among other things was the site of a Naval ROTC installation in which he was forcibly enrolled.\n\nThe Iowa State Naval ROTC had a band, and was delighted to hear that Lawrence had an interest in music. Since it was hard to drill on the deck of a dreadnought while playing a pipe organ, they issued him a glockenspiel and a couple of little dingers.\n\nWhen not marching back and forth on the flood plain of the Skunk River making loud dinging noises, Lawrence was majoring in mechanical engineering. He ended up doing poorly in this area because he had fallen in with a Bulgarian professor named John Vincent Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, who were building a machine that was intended to automate the solution of some especially tedious differential equations.\n\nThe basic problem for Lawrence was that he was lazy. He had figured out that everything was much simpler if, like Superman with his X-ray vision, you just stared through the cosmetic distractions and saw the underlying mathematical skeleton. Once you found the math in a thing, you knew everything about it, and you could manipulate it to your heart's content with nothing more than a pencil and a napkin. He saw it in the curve of the silver bars on his glockenspiel, saw it in the catenary arch of a bridge and in the capacitor-studded drum of Atanasoff and Berry's computing machine. Actually pounding on the glockenspiel, riveting the bridge together, or trying to figure out why the computing machine wasn't working were not as interesting to him.\n\nConsequently he got poor grades. From time to time, though, he would perform some stunt on the blackboard that would leave his professor weak in the knees and the other students baffled and hostile. Word got around.\n\nAt the same time, his grandmother Blanche was invoking her extensive Congregational connections, working the angles on Lawrence's behalf, totally unbeknownst to him. Her efforts culminated in triumph when Lawrence was awarded an obscure scholarship, endowed by a St. Paul oat-processing heir, whose purpose was to send Midwestern Congregationalists to the Ivy League for one year, which (evidently) was deemed a long enough period of time to raise their IQs by a few crucial points but not long enough to debauch them. So Lawrence got to be a sophomore in Princeton.\n\nNow Princeton was an august school and going there was a great honor, but no one got around to mentioning either of these facts to Lawrence, who had no way of knowing. This had bad and good consequences. He accepted the scholarship with a faintness of gratitude that infuriated the oat lord. On the other hand, he adjusted to Princeton easily because it was just another place. It reminded him of the nicer bits of Virginia, and there were some nice pipe organs in town, though he was not all that happy with his engineering homework of bridge-designing and sprocket-cutting problems. As always, these eventually came down to math, most of which he could handle easily. From time to time he would get stuck, though, which led him to the Fine Hall: the headquarters of the Math Department.\n\nThere was a motley assortment of fellows wandering around in Fine Hall, many sporting British or European accents. Administratively speaking, many of these fellows were not members of the Math Department at all, but a separate thing called IAS, which stood for Institute for Advanced something-or-other. But they were all in the same building and they all knew a thing or two about math, so the distinction didn't exist for Lawrence.\n\nQuite a few of these men would pretend shyness when Lawrence sought their advice, but others were at least willing to hear him out. For example: he had come up with a way to solve a difficult sprocket tooth shape problem that, as normally solved by engineers, would require any number of perfectly reasonable but aesthetically displeasing approximations. Lawrence's solution would provide exact results. The only drawback was that it would require a quintillion slide-rule operators a quintillion years to solve. Lawrence was working on a radically different approach that, if it worked, would bring those figures down to a trillion and a trillion respectively. Unfortunately, Lawrence was unable to interest anyone at Fine Hall in anything as prosaic as gears, until all of a sudden he made friends with an energetic British fellow, whose name he promptly forgot, but who had been doing a lot of literal sprocket-making himself lately. This fellow was trying to build, of all things, a mechanical calculating machine--specifically a machine to calculate certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.\n\n\ncertain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.\n\n[equation cannot be rendered in text]\n\nwhere s is a complex number.\n\nLawrence found this zeta function to be no more and no less interesting than any other math problem until his new friend assured him that it was frightfully important, and that some of the best mathematicians in the world had been gnawing on it for decades. The two of them ended up staying awake until three in the morning working out the solution to Lawrence's sprocket problem. Lawrence presented the results proudly to his engineering professor, who snidely rejected it, on grounds of practicality, and gave him a poor grade for his troubles.\n\nLawrence finally remembered, after several more contacts, that the name of the friendly Brit was Al something-or-other. Because Al was a passionate cyclist, he and Al went on quite a few bicycle rides through the countryside of the Garden State. As they rode around New Jersey, they talked about math, and particularly about machines for taking the dull part of math off their hands.\n\nBut Al had been thinking about this subject for longer than Lawrence, and had figured out that computing machines were much more than just labor-saving devices. He'd been working on a radically different sort of computing mechanism that would work out any arithmetic problem whatsoever, as long as you knew how to write the problem down. From a pure logic standpoint, he had already figured out everything there was to know about this (as yet hypothetical) machine, though he had yet to build one. Lawrence gathered that actually building machinery was looked on as undignified at Cambridge (England, that is, where this Al character was based) or for that matter at Fine Hall. Al was thrilled to have found, in Lawrence, someone who did not share this view.\n\nAl delicately asked him, one day, if Lawrence would terribly mind calling him by his full and proper name, which was Alan and not Al. Lawrence apologized and said he would try very hard to keep it in mind.\n\nOne day a couple of weeks later, as the two of them sat by a running stream in the woods above the Delaware Water Gap, Alan made some kind of an outlandish proposal to Lawrence involving penises. It required a great deal of methodical explanation, which Alan delivered with lots of blushing and stuttering. He was ever so polite, and several times emphasized that he was acutely aware that not everyone in the world was interested in this sort of thing.\n\nLawrence decided that he was probably one of those people.\n\nAlan seemed vastly impressed that Lawrence had paused to think about it at all and apologized for putting him out. They went directly back to a discussion of computing machines, and their friendship continued unchanged. But on their next bicycle ride--an overnight camping trip to the Pine Barrens--they were joined by a new fellow, a German named Rudy von something-or-other.\n\nAlan and Rudy's relationship seemed closer, or at least more multilayered, than Alan and Lawrence's. Lawrence concluded that Alan's penis scheme must have finally found a taker.\n\nIt got Lawrence to thinking. From an evolution standpoint, what was the point of having people around who were not inclined to have offspring? There must be some good, and fairly subtle, reason for it.\n\nThe only thing he could work out was that it was groups of people--societies--rather than individual creatures, who were now trying to out-reproduce and/or kill each other, and that, in a society, there was plenty of room for someone who didn't have kids as long as he was up to something useful.\n\nAlan and Rudy and Lawrence rode south, anyway, looking for the Pine Barrens. After a while the towns became very far apart, and the horse farms gave way to a low stubble of feeble, spiny trees that appeared to extend all the way to Florida--blocking their view, but not the headwind. ``Where are the Pine Barrens I wonder?'' Lawrence asked a couple of times. He even stopped at a gas station to ask someone that question. His companions began to make fun of him.\n\n``Vere are ze Pine Barrens?'' Rudy inquired, looking about quizzically.\n\n``I should look for something rather barren-looking, with numerous pine trees,'' Alan mused.\n\nThere was no other traffic and so they had spread out across the road to pedal three abreast, with Alan in the middle.\n\n``A forest, as Kafka would imagine it,'' Rudy muttered.\n\nBy this point Lawrence had figured out that they were, in fact, in the Pine Barrens. But he didn't know who Kafka was. ``A mathematician?'' he guessed.\n\n``Zat is a scary sing to sink of,'' Rudy said.\n\n``He is a writer,'' Alan said. ``Lawrence, please don't be offended that I ask you this, but: do you recognize any other people's names at all? Other than family and close friends, I mean.''\n\nLawrence must have looked baffled. ``I'm trying to figure out whether it all comes from in here,'' Alan said, reaching out to rap his knuckles on the side of Lawrence's head, ``or do you sometimes take in new ideas from other human beings?''\n\n\n``When I was a little boy, I saw angels in a church in Virginia,'' Lawrence said, ``but I think that they came from inside my head.''\n\n``Very well,'' Alan said.\n\nBut later Alan had another go at it. They had reached the fire lookout tower and it had been a thunderous disappointment: just an alienated staircase leading nowhere, and a small cleared area below that was glittery with shards of liquor bottles. They pitched their tent by the side of a pond that turned out to be full of rust-colored algae that stuck to the hairs on their bodies. Then there was nothing left to do but drink schnapps and talk about math.\n\n\nAlan said, ``Look, it's like this: Bertrand Russell and another chap named Whitehead wrote Principia Mathematica...''\n\n\n``Now I know you're pulling my leg,'' Waterhouse said. ``Even I know that Sir Isaac Newton wrote that.''\n\n\n``Newton wrote a different book, also called Principia Mathematica, which isn't really about mathematics at all; it's about what we would today call physics.''\n\n\n``Then why did he call it Principia Mathematica?''\n\n\n``Because the distinction between mathematics and physics wasn't especially clear in Newton's day--''\n\n\n``Or maybe even in zis day,'' Rudy said.\n\n\n``--which is directly relevant to what I'm talking about,'' Alan continued. ``I am talking about Russell's P.M., in which he and Whitehead started absolutely from scratch, I mean from nothing, and built it all up--all mathematics--from a small number of first principles. And why I am telling you this, Lawrence, is that--Lawrence! Pay attention!''\n\n\n``Hmmm?''\n\n\n``Rudy--take this stick, here--that's right--and keep a close eye on Lawrence, and when he gets that foggy look on his face, poke him with it!''\n\n\n``Zis is not an English school, you can't do zese kind of sing.''\n\n\n``I'm listening,'' Lawrence said.\n\n\n``What came out of P.M., which was terrifically radical, was the ability to say that all of math, really, can be expressed as a certain ordering of symbols.''\n\n``Leibniz said it a long time before zen!'' protested Rudy.\n\n``Er, Leibniz invented the notation we use for calculus, but--''\n\n``I'm not talking about zat!''\n\n``And he invented matrices, but--''\n\n``I'm not talking about zat eezer!''\n\n``And he did some work with binary arithmetic, but--''\n\n``Zat is completely different!''\n\n``Well, what the hell are you talking about, then, Rudy?''\n\n``Leibniz invented ze basic alphabet--wrote down a set of symbols, for expressing statements about logic.''\n\n``Well, I wasn't aware that Herr Leibniz counted formal logic among his interests, but--''\n\n``Of course! He wanted to do what Russell and Whitehead did, except not just with mathematics, but with everything in ze whole world!''\n\n``Well from the fact that you are the only man on the planet, Rudy, who seems to know about this undertaking of Leibniz's, can we assume that he failed?''\n\n``You can assume anything that pleases your fancy, Alan,'' Rudy responded, ``but I am a mathematician and I do not assume anything.''\n\nAlan sighed woundedly, and gave Rudy a Significant Look which Waterhouse assumed meant that there would be trouble later. ``If I may just make some headway, here,'' he said, ``all I'm really trying to get you to agree on, is that mathematics can be expressed as a series of symbols,'' (he snatched the Lawrence-poking stick and began drawing things like  the dirt) ``and frankly I could not care less whether they happen to be Leibniz's symbols, or Russell's, or the hexagrams of the I Ching....''\n\n``Leibniz was fascinated by the I Ching!'' Rudy began.\n\n``Shut up about Leibniz for a moment, Rudy, because look here: You--Rudy--and I are on a train, as it were, sitting in the dining car, having a nice conversation, and that train is being pulled along at a terrific clip by certain locomotives named The Bertrand Russell and Riemann and Euler and others. And our friend Lawrence is running alongside the train, trying to keep up with us--it's not that we're smarter than he is, necessarily, but that he's a farmer who didn't get a ticket. And I, Rudy, am simply reaching out through the open window here, trying to pull him onto the fucking train with us so that the three of us can have a nice little chat about mathematics without having to listen to him panting and gasping for breath the whole way.''\n\n``All right, Alan.''\n\n``Won't take a minute if you will just stop interrupting.''\n\n``But there is a locomotive too named Leibniz.''\n\n``Is it that you don't think I give enough credit to Germans? Because I am about to mention a fellow with an umlaut.''\n\n``Oh, would it be Herr Turing?'' Rudy said slyly.\n\n``Herr Turing comes later. I was actually thinking of Godel.''\n\n``But he's not German! He's Austrian!''\n\n``I'm afraid that it's all the same now, isn't it?''\n\n``Ze Anschluss wasn't my idea, you don't have to look at me that way, I think Hitler is appalling.''\n\n``I've heard of Godel,'' Waterhouse put in helpfully. ``But could we back up just a sec?''\n\n``Of course Lawrence.''\n\n``Why bother? Why did Russell do it? Was there something wrong with math? I mean, two plus two equals four, right?''\n\nAlan picked up two bottlecaps and set them down on the ground. ``Two. One-two. Plus--'' He set down two more. ``Another two. One-two. Equals four. One-two-three-four.''\n\n``What's so bad about that?'' Lawrence said.\n\n``But Lawrence--when you really do math, in an abstract way, you're not counting bottlecaps, are you?''\n\n``I'm not counting anything.''\n\nRudy broke the following news: ``Zat is a very modern position for you to take.''\n\n``It is?''\n\nAlan said, ``There was this implicit belief, for a long time, that math was a sort of physics of bottlecaps. That any mathematical operation you could do on paper, no matter how complicated, could be reduced--in theory, anyway--to messing about with actual physical counters, such as bottlecaps, in the real world.''\n\n``But you can't have two point one bottlecaps.''\n\n``All right, all right, say we use bottlecaps for integers, and for real numbers like two point one, we use physical measurements, like the length of this stick.'' Alan tossed the stick down next to the bottlecaps.\n\n``Well what about pi, then? You can't have a stick that's exactly pi inches long.''\n\n``Pi is from geometry--ze same story,'' Rudy put in.\n\n``Yes, it was believed that Euclid's geometry was really a kind of physics, that his lines and so on represented properties of the physical world. But--you know Einstein?''\n\n``I'm not very good with names.''\n\n``That white-haired chap with the big mustache?''\n\n``Oh, yeah,'' Lawrence said dimly, ``I tried to ask him my sprocket question. He claimed he was late for an appointment or something.''\n\n``That fellow has come up with a general relativity theory, which is sort of a practical application, not of Euclid's, but of Riemann's geometry--''\n\n``The same Riemann of your zeta function?''\n\n``Same Riemann, different subject. Now let's not get sidetracked here Lawrence--''\n\n``Riemann showed you could have many many different geometries that were not the geometry of Euclid but that still made sense internally,'' Rudy explained.\n\n``All right, so back to P.M. then,'' Lawrence said.\n\n``Yes! Russell and Whitehead. It's like this: when mathematicians began fooling around with things like the square root of negative one, and quaternions, then they were no longer dealing with things that you could translate into sticks and bottlecaps. And yet they were still getting sound results.''\n\n``Or at least internally consistent results,'' Rudy said.\n\n``Okay. Meaning that math was more than a physics of bottlecaps.''\n\n``It appeared that way, Lawrence, but this raised the question of was mathematics really true or was it just a game played with symbols? In other words--are we discovering Truth, or just wanking?''\n\n``It has to be true because if you do physics with it, it all works out! I've heard of that general relativity thing, and I know they did experiments and figured out it was true.''\n\n``Ze great majority of mathematics does not lend itself to experimental testing,'' Rudy said.\n\n``The whole idea of this project is to sever the ties to physics,'' Alan said.\n\n``And yet not to be vanking ourselves.''\n\n``That's what P.M. was trying to do?''\n\n``Russell and Whitehead broke all mathematical concepts down into brutally simple things like sets. From there they got to integers, and so on.''\n\n``But how can you break something like pi down into a set?''\n\n``You can't,'' Alan said, ``but you can express it as a long string of digits. Three point one four one five nine, and so on.''\n\n``And digits are integers,'' Rudy said.\n\n``But no fair! Pi itself is not an integer!''\n\n``But you can calculate the digits of pi, one at a time, by using certain formulas. And you can write down the formulas like so!'' Alan scratches this in the dirt:\n\n\n\n``I have used the Leibniz series in order to placate our friend. See, Lawrence? It is a string of symbols.''\n\n``Okay. I see the string of symbols,'' Lawrence said reluctantly.\n\n``Can we move on? Godel said, just a few years ago, `Say! If you buy into this business about mathematics being just strings of symbols, guess what?' And he pointed out that any string of symbols--such as this very formula, here--can be translated into integers.''\n\n``How?''\n\n``Nothing fancy, Lawrence--it's just simple encryption. Arbitrary. The number `538' might be written down instead of this great ugly \u00a3, and so on.''\n\n``Seems pretty close to wanking, now.''\n\n``No, no. Because then Godel sprang the trap! Formulas can act on numbers, right?''\n\n``Sure. Like 2x.''\n\n``Yes. You can substitute any number for x and the formula 2x will double it. But if another mathematical formula, such as this one right here, for calculating pi, can be encoded as a number, then you can have another formula act on it. Formulas acting on formulas!''\n\n``Is that all?''\n\n``No. Then he showed, really through a very simple argument, that if formulas really can refer to themselves, it's possible to write one down saying `this statement cannot be proved.' Which was tremendously startling to Hilbert and everyone else, who expected the opposite result.''\n\n``Have you mentioned this Hilbert guy before?''\n\n``No, he is new to this discussion, Lawrence.''\n\n``Who is he?''\n\n``A man who asks difficult questions. He asked a whole list of them once. Go[audel answered one of them.''\n\n``And Turing answered another,'' Rudy said.\n\n``Who's that?''\n\n``It's me,'' Alan said. ``But Rudy's joking. `Turing' doesn't really have an umlaut in it.''\n\n``He's going to have an umlaut in him later tonight,'' Rudy said, looking at Alan in a way that, in retrospect, years later, Lawrence would understand to have been smoldering.\n\n``Well, don't keep me in suspense. Which one of his questions did you answer?''\n\n``The Entscheidungsproblem,'' Rudy said.\n\n``Meaning?''\n\nAlan explained, ``Hilbert wanted to know whether any given statement could, in principle, be found true or false.''\n\n``But after Godel got finished, it changed,'' Rudy pointed out.\n\n``That's true--after Godel it became `Can we determine whether any given statement is provable or non-provable?' In other words, is there some sort of mechanical process we could use to separate the provable statements from the nonprovable ones?''\n\n`` `Mechanical process' is supposed to be a metaphor, Alan....''\n\n``Oh, stop it, Rudy! Lawrence and I are quite comfortable with machinery.''\n\n``I get it,'' Lawrence said.\n\n``What do you mean, you get it?'' Alan said.\n\n``Your machine--not the zeta-function calculator, but the other one. The one we've been talking about building--''\n\n``It is called Universal Turing Machine,'' Rudy said.\n\n``The whole point of that gizmo is to separate provable from nonprovable statements, isn't it?''\n\n``That's why I came up with the basic idea for it,'' Alan said. ``So Hilbert's question has been answered. Now I just want to actually build one so that I can beat Rudy at chess.''\n\n``You haven't told poor Lawrence the answer yet!'' Rudy protested.\n\n``Lawrence can figure it out,'' Alan said. ``It'll give him something to do.''\n\nSoon it became clear that Alan really meant: It'll give him something to do while we're fucking. Lawrence shoved a notebook into the waistband of his trousers and rode his bicycle a few hundred yards to the fire tower, then climbed up the stairs to the platform at the top and sat down, back to the setting sun, notebook propped up on his knees to catch the light.\n\nHe could not collect his thoughts, and then he was distracted by a false sunrise that lit up the clouds off to the northeast. He thought at first that some low clouds were bouncing fragments of the sunset back to him, but it was too concentrated and flickering for that. Then he thought it was lightning. But the color of the light was not blue enough. It fluctuated sharply, modulated by (one had to assume) great, startling events that were occulted by the horizon. As the sun went down on the opposite side of the world, the light on the New Jersey horizon focused to a steady, lambent core the color of a flashlight when you shine it through the palm of your hand under the bedsheets.\n\nLawrence climbed down the stairs and got on his bicycle and rode through the Pine Barrens. Before long he came to a road that led in the general direction of the light. Most of the time he could not see anything, not even the road, but after a couple of hours the glow bouncing off the low cloud layer lit up flat stones in the road, and turned the barrens' wandering rivulets into glowing crevices.\n\nThe road began to tend in the wrong direction and so Lawrence cut directly into the woods, because he was very close now, and the light in the sky was strong enough that he could see it through the sparse carpet of scrubby pines--black sticks that appeared to have been burned, though they hadn't. The ground had turned into sand, but it was damp and compacted, and his bicycle had fat tires that rode over it well. At one point he had to stop and throw the bike over a barbed-wire fence. Then he broke out of the sticks and onto a perfectly flat expanse of white sand, stitched down with tufts of beach grass, and just then he was dazzled by a low fence of quiet steady flames that ran across a part of the horizon about as wide as the harvest moon when it sinks into the sea. Its brightness made it difficult to see anything else--Lawrence kept riding into little ditches and creeks that meandered across the flats. He learned not to stare directly at the flames. Looking off to the sides was more interesting anyway: the table-land was marked at wide intervals by the largest buildings he had ever seen, cracker-box structures built by Pharaohs, and in the mile-wide plazas between them, gnomons of triangulated steel were planted in wide stances: the internal skeletons of pyramids. The largest of these pierced the center of a perfectly circular railway line a few hundred feet in diameter: two argent curves scored on the dull ground, interrupted in one place where the tower's shadow, a stopped sundial, told the time. He rode by a building smaller than the others, with oval tanks standing next to it. Steam murmured from valves on the tops of the tanks, but instead of rising into the air it dribbled down the sides and struck the ground and spread out, coating the sea-grass with jackets of silver.\n\nA thousand sailors in white were standing in a ring around the long flame. One of them held up his hand and waved Lawrence down. Lawrence came to a stop next to the sailor and planted one foot on the sand to steady himself. He and the sailor stared at each other for a moment and then Lawrence, who could not think of anything else, said, ``I am in the Navy also.'' Then the sailor seemed to make up his mind about something. He saluted Lawrence through, and pointed him towards a small building off to the side of the fire.\n\nThe building looked only like a wall glowing in the firelight, but sometimes a barrage of magnesium blue light made its windowframes jump out of the darkness, a rectangular lightning-bolt that echoed many times across the night. Lawrence started pedaling again and rode past that building: a spiraling flock of alert fedoras, prodding at slim terse notebooks with stately Ticonderogas, crab-walking photogs turning their huge chrome daisies, crisp rows of people sleeping with blankets over their faces, a sweating man with Brilliantined hair chalking umlauted names on a blackboard. Finally coming around this building he smelled hot fuel oil, felt the heat of the flames on his face and saw beach-glass curled toward it and desiccated.\n\nHe stared down upon the world's globe, not the globe fleshed with continents and oceans but only its skeleton: a burst of meridians, curving backwards to cage an inner dome of orange flame. Against the light of the burning oil those longitudes were thin and crisp as a draftsman's ink-strokes. But coming closer he saw them resolve into clever works of rings and struts, hollow as a bird's bones. As they spread away from the pole they sooner or later began to wander, or split into bent parts, or just broke off and hung in the fire oscillating like dry stalks. The perfect geometry was also mottled, here and there, by webs of cable and harnesses of electrical wiring. Lawrence almost rode over a broken wine bottle and decided he should now walk, to spare his bicycle's tires, so he laid the bike down, the front wheel covering an aluminum vase that appeared to have been spun on a lathe, with a few charred roses hanging out of it. Some sailors had joined their hands to form a sort of throne, and were bearing along a human-shaped piece of charcoal dressed in a coverall of immaculate asbestos. As they walked the toes of their shoes caught in vast, ramified snarls of ropes and piano-wires, cables and wires, creative furtive movements in the grass and the sand dozens of yards every direction. Lawrence began planting his feet very thoughtfully one in front of the other, trying to measure the greatness of what he had come and seen. A rocket-shaped pod stuck askew from the sand, supporting an umbrella of bent-back propellers. The duralumin struts and catwalks rambled on above him for miles. There was a suitcase spilled open, with a pair of women's shoes displayed as if in the window of a downtown store, and a menu that had been charred to an oval glow, and then some tousled wall-slabs, like a whole room that had dropped out of the sky--these were decorated, one with a giant map of the world, great circles arcing away from Berlin to pounce on cities near and far, and another with a photograph of a famous, fat German in a uniform, grinning on a flowered platform, the giant horizon of a new Zeppelin behind him.\n\nAfter a while he stopped seeing new things. Then he got on his bicycle and rode back through the Pine Barrens. He got lost in the dark and so didn't find his way back to the fire tower until dawn. But he didn't mind being lost because while he rode around in the dark he thought about the Turing machine. Finally he came back to the shore of the pond where they had camped. The dawn-light shining on the saucer of calm reddish water made it look like a pool of blood. Alan Mathison Turing and Rudolf von Hacklheber were lying together like spoons on the shore, still smudged a little bit from their swim yesterday. Lawrence started a little fire and made some tea and they woke up eventually.\n\n``Did you solve the problem?'' Alan asked him.\n\n``Well you can turn that Universal Turing Machine of yours into any machine by changing the presets--''\n\n``Presets?''\n\n``Sorry, Alan, I think of your U.T.M. as being kind of like a pipe organ.''\n\n``Oh.''\n\n``Once you've done that, anyway, you can do any calculation you please, if the tape is long enough. But gosh, Alan, making a tape that's long enough, and that you can write symbols on, and erase them, is going to be sort of tricky--Atanasoff's capacitor drum would only work up to a certain size--you'd have to--''\n\n``This is a digression,'' Alan said gently.\n\n``Yeah, okay, well--if you had a machine like that, then any given preset could be represented by a number--a string of symbols. And the tape that you would feed into it to start the calculation would contain another string of symbols. So it's Go[audel's proof all over again--if any possible combination of machine and data can be represented by a string of numbers, then you can just arrange all of the possible strings of numbers into a big table, and then it turns into a Cantor diagonal type of argument, and the answer is that there must be some numbers that cannot be computed.''\n\n``And ze Entscheidungsproblem?'' Rudy reminded him.\n\n``Proving or disproving a formula--once you've encrypted the formula into numbers, that is--is just a calculation on that number. So it means that the answer to the question is, no! Some formulas cannot be proved or disproved by any mechanical process! So I guess there's some point in being human after all!''\n\nAlan looked pleased until Lawrence said this last thing, and then his face collapsed. ``Now there you go making unwarranted assumptions.''\n\n``Don't listen to him, Lawrence!'' Rudy said. ``He's going to tell you that our brains are Turing machines.''\n\n``Thank you, Rudy,'' Alan said patiently. ``Lawrence, I submit that our brains are Turing machines.''\n\n``But you proved that there's a whole lot of formulas that a Turing machine can't process!''\n\n``And you have proved it too, Lawrence.''\n\n``But don't you think that we can do some things that a Turing machine couldn't?''\n\n``Godel agrees with you, Lawrence,'' Rudy put in, ``and so does Hardy.''\n\n``Give me one example,'' Alan said.\n\n``Of a noncomputable function that a human can do, and a Turing machine can't?''\n\n``Yes. And don't give me any sentimental nonsense about creativity. I believe that a Universal Turing Machine could show behaviors that we would construe as creative.''\n\n``Well, I don't know then... I'll try to keep my eye out for that kind of thing in the future.''\n\nBut later, as they were riding back towards Princeton, he said, ``What about dreams?''\n\n``Like those angels in Virginia?''\n\n``I guess so.''\n\n``Just noise in the neurons, Lawrence.''\n\n``Also I dreamed last night that a zeppelin was burning.''\n\n\n\nSoon, Alan got his Ph.D. and went back to England. He wrote Lawrence a couple of letters. The last of these stated, simply, that he would not be able to write Lawrence any more letters ``of substance'' and that Lawrence should not take it personally. Lawrence perceived right away that Alan's society had put him to work doing something useful--probably figuring out how to keep it from being eaten alive by certain of its neighbors. Lawrence wondered what use America would find for him.\n\nHe went back to Iowa State, considered changing his major to mathematics, but didn't. It was the consensus of all whom he consulted that mathematics, like pipe-organ restoration, was a fine thing, but that one needed some way to put bread on the table. He remained in engineering and did more and more poorly at it until the middle of his senior year, when the university suggested that he enter a useful line of work, such as roofing. He walked straight out of college into the waiting arms of the Navy.\n\nThey gave him an intelligence test. The first question on the math part had to do with boats on a river: Port Smith is 100 miles upstream of Port Jones. The river flows at 5 miles per hour. The boat goes through water at 10 miles per hour. How long does it take to go from Port Smith to Port Jones? How long to come back?\n\nLawrence immediately saw that it was a trick question. You would have to be some kind of idiot to make the facile assumption that the current would add or subtract 5 miles per hour to or from the speed of the boat. Clearly, 5 miles per hour was nothing more than the average speed. The current would be faster in the middle of the river and slower at the banks. More complicated variations could be expected at bends in the river. Basically it was a question of hydrodynamics, which could be tackled using certain well-known systems of differential equations. Lawrence dove into the problem, rapidly (or so he thought) covering both sides of ten sheets of paper with calculations. Along the way, he realized that one of his assumptions, in combination with the simplified Navier-Stokes equations, had led him into an exploration of a particularly interesting family of partial differential equations. Before he knew it, he had proved a new theorem. If that didn't prove his intelligence, what would?\n\nThen the time bell rang and the papers were collected. Lawrence managed to hang onto his scratch paper. He took it back to his dorm, typed it up, and mailed it to one of the more approachable math professors at Princeton, who promptly arranged for it to be published in a Parisian mathematics journal.\n\nLawrence received two free, freshly printed copies of the journal a few months later, in San Diego, California, during mail call on board a large ship called the U.S.S. Nevada. The ship had a band, and the Navy had given Lawrence the job of playing the glockenspiel in it, because their testing procedures had proven that he was not intelligent enough to do anything else.\n\nThe sack of mail carrying Lawrence's contribution to the mathematical literature arrived just in the nick of time. Lawrence's ship, and quite a few of her sisters, had until then been based in California. But at just this moment, all of them were transferred to some place called Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in order to show the Nips who was boss.\n\nLawrence had never really known what he wanted to do with his life, but he quickly decided that being glockenspiel player on a battleship in Hawaii during peacetime was a long way from the worst life you could possibly have. The harshest part of the job was sometimes having to sit or march in very warm conditions, and enduring occasional fluffed notes by other band members. He had abundant free time, which he spent working on a series of new theorems in the field of information theory. The field had been invented and pretty much encompassed by his friend Alan, but there was much detail work to be done. He and Alan and Rudy had sketched out a general plan of what needed to be proved or disproved. Lawrence tore through the list. He wondered what Alan and Rudy were up to in Britain and Germany, but he couldn't write to them and find out, so he kept his work to himself. When he wasn't playing the glockenspiel or working out theorems, there were bars and dances to go to. Waterhouse did some penis work of his own, got the clap, had it cured,* bought condoms. All of the sailors did this. They were like three-year olds who shove pencils in their ears, discover that it hurts, and stop doing it. Lawrence's first year went by almost instantly. Time just blazed by. Nowhere could be sunnier, more relaxing, than Hawaii.\n\n*1940 being a good year to begin experimenting with venereal diseases in that the new injectable penicillin was just becoming available\n\n\n\nNOVUS ORDO SECLORUM\n\n``Filipinos are a warm, gentle, caring, giving people,'' avi says, ``which is a good thing since so many of them carry concealed weapons.''\n\nRandy is in Tokyo's airport, ambling down a concourse with a slowness that is infuriating to his fellow travelers. They have all spent the last half-day strapped into bad chairs, stuffed into an aluminum tube aslosh with jet fuel. Over the safety-engineered nubs molded into the jetway floor, their rolling suitcases drone like fighter planes. They graze the backs of his knees as they bank around his husky columnar body. Randy is holding his new GSM phone to the side of his head. Supposedly it works anywhere in the world, except for the United States. This is his first chance to try it out.\n\n``You sound clear as a bell,'' Avi says. ``How was the flight over?''\n\n``All right,'' Randy says. ``They had one of those animated maps up on the video screen.''\n\nAvi sighs. ``All the airlines have those now,'' he announces monotonically.\n\n``The only feature between San Francisco and Tokyo was Midway Island.''\n\n``So?''\n\n``It kind of hung there for hours. MIDWAY. Mute embarrassment all around.''\n\nRandy reaches the departure gate for Manila, and pauses to admire a five-foot-wide high-definition TV set bearing the logo of a major Nipponese consumer-electronics company. It is running a video in which a wacky cartoon professor and his adorable canine sidekick cheerfully tick off the three transmission routes of the AIDS virus.\n\n``I have a fingerprint for you,'' Randy says.\n\n``Shoot.''\n\nRandy stares at the palm of his hand, on which he has written a string of numbers and letters in ballpoint pen. ``AF 10 06 E9 99 BA 11 07 64 C1 89 E3 40 8C 72 55.''\n\n``Got it,'' Avi says. ``That's from Ordo, right?''\n\n``Right. I e-mailed you the key from SFO.''\n\n``The apartment situation is still resolving,'' Avi says. ``So I just reserved you a suite at the Manila Hotel.''\n\n``What do you mean, it's still resolving?''\n\n``The Philippines is one of those post-Spanish countries with no clear boundaries between business and personal relationships,'' Avi says. ``I don't think you can secure lodgings there without marrying into a family with a major street named after it.''\n\nRandy takes a seat in the departure area. Perky gate attendants in jaunty, improbable hats zero in on Filipinos with too many carry-ons, and subject them to a public ritual of filling out little tags and surrendering their possessions. The Filipinos roll their eyes and stare longingly out the windows. But most of the waiting passengers are Nipponese--some businessmen, mostly vacationers. They are watching an educational video about how to get mugged in foreign countries.\n\n``Huh,'' Randy says, looking out the window, ``got another 747 down to Manila.''\n\n``In Asia, no decent airline bothers to dick around anything smaller than a 747,'' Avi snaps. ``If someone tries to pack you on board a 737 or god forbid an Airbus, run, don't walk, away from the boarding lounge, and call me on my Sky Pager and I'll send in a chopper to evacuate you.''\n\nRandy laughs.\n\nAvi continues. ``Now, listen. This hotel you're going to is very old, very grand, but it's in the middle of nowhere.''\n\n``Why would they build a grand hotel in the middle of nowhere?''\n\n``It used to be a happening place--it's on the waterfront, right on the edge of Intramuros.''\n\nRandy's high-school Spanish is enough to translate that: Inside the Walls.\n\n``But Intramuros was annihilated by the Nipponese in 1945,'' Avi continues. ``Systematically. All of the business hotels and office buildings are in a new neighborhood called Makati, much closer to the airport.''\n\n``So you want to put our office in Intramuros.''\n\n``How'd you guess?'' Avi says, sounding a little spooked. He prides himself on unpredictability.\n\n``I'm not an intuitive guy generally,'' Randy says, ``but I've been on a plane for thirteen hours and my brain has been turned inside out and hung up to dry.''\n\nAvi rattles off canned justifications: office space is much cheaper in Intramuros. Government ministries are closer. Makati, the gleaming new business district, is too isolated from the real Philippines. Randy pays no attention to it.\n\n``You want to work out of Intramuros because it was systematically annihilated, and because you're obsessed with the Holocaust,'' Randy finally says, quietly and without rancor.\n\n``Yeah. So?'' Avi says.\n\nRandy stares out the window of the Manila-bound 747, sipping on a fluorescent green Nipponese soft drink made from bee extracts (at least, it has pictures of bees on it) and munching on something that a flight attendant handed him called Japanese Snack. Sky and ocean are the same color, a shade of blue that makes his teeth freeze. The plane is so high that, whether he looks up or down, he sees foreshortened views of boiling cumulonimbus stacks. The clouds erupt from the hot Pacific as if immense warships were exploding all over the place. The speed and power of their growth is alarming, the forms they adopt as bizarre and varied as those of deep-sea organisms, and all of them, he supposes, are as dangerous to an airplane as punji stakes to a barefoot pedestrian. The red-orange meatball painted on the wingtip startles him when he notices it. He feels like he's been thrown into an old war film.\n\nHe turns on his laptop. Electronic mail from Avi, encrypted to a fare-thee-well, has been piling up in his in-box. It is a gradual accumulation of tiny files, thrown at him by Avi whenever a thought popped into his head over the last three days; it would be obvious, even if Randy didn't know it, that Avi owns a portable e-mail machine that talks to the Internet by radio. Randy fires up a piece of software that is technically called Novus Ordo Seclorum but that everyone calls Ordo for short. It is a fairly strained pun based on the fact that Ordo's job, as a piece of cryptographic software, is to put a message's bits in a New Order and that it will take Centuries for nosy governments to decrypt it. A scanned image of a Great Pyramid appears in the middle of his screen, and a single eye gradually materializes at its apex.\n\nOrdo can handle this in one of two ways. The obvious way is to decrypt all of the messages and convert them into plaintext files on his hard disk, which he can then read any time he wants. The problem with this (if you are paranoid) is that anyone who gets his hands on Randy's hard disk can then read the files. For all he knows, the customs officials in Manila will decide to ransack his computer for child pornography. Or, fogged by jet lag, he'll leave his laptop in a taxi. So instead he puts Ordo into a streaming mode where it will decrypt the files just long enough for him to read them and then, when he closes the windows, expunge the plaintext from the computer's memory and from its hard drive.\n\nThe subject heading of Avi's first message is: ``Guideline 1.''\n\nWe look for places where the math is right. Meaning what? Meaning that pop. is about to explode---we can predict that just by looking at age histogram---and per capita income is about to take off the way it did in Nippon, Taiwan, Singapore. Multiply those two things together and you get the kind of exponential growth that should get us all into fuck-you money before we turn forty.\n\nThis is an allusion to a Randy/Avi conversation of two years ago wherein Avi actually calculated a specific numerical value for ``fuck-you money.'' It was not a fixed constant, however, but rather a cell in a spreadsheet linked to any number of continually fluctuating economic indicators. Sometimes when Avi is working at his computer he will leave the spreadsheet running in a tiny window in the corner so that he can see the current value of ``fuck-you money'' at a glance.\n\nThe second message, sent a couple of hours later, is called ``Guideline 2.''\n\nTwo: pick a tech where no one can compete with us. Right now, that=networking. We're kicking the crap out of everyone else in the world when it comes to networking. It's not even funny.\n\nThe next day, Avi sent a message called, simply, ``More.'' Perhaps he had lost track of the number of guidelines he'd issued so far.\n\nAnother principle: this time we retain control of the corporation. That means that we keep at least fifty percent of the shares---which means little to no outside investment until we've built up some value.\n\n``You don't have to convince me,'' Randy mumbles to himself, as he reads this.\n\nThis shapes the kinds of businesses we can get into. Forget anything that requires a big initial investment.\n\nLuzon is green-black jungle mountains gouged with rivers that would appear to be avalanches of silt. As the navy-blue ocean verges on its khaki beaches, the water takes on the shocking iridescent hue of a suburban swimming pool. Farther south, the mountains are swidden-scarred--the soil beneath is bright red and so these parts look like fresh lacerations. But most is covered with foliage that looks like the nubby green stuff that model railroaders put over their papier-mache hills, and in vast stretches of the mountains there are no signs whatsoever that human beings have ever existed. Closer to Manila, some of the slopes are deforested, sprinkled with structures, ribboned with power-line cuts. Rice paddies line the basins. The towns are accretions of shanties, nucleated around large cross-shaped churches with good roofs.\n\nThe view gets blurry as they belly down into the pall of sweaty smog above the city. The plane begins to sweat like a giant glass of iced tea. The water streams off in sheets, collects in crevices, whips off the flaps' trailing edges.\n\nSuddenly they are banking over Manila Bay, which is marked with endless streaks of brilliant red--some kind of algal bloom. Oil tankers trail long time-delayed rainbows that flourish in their wakes. Every cove is jammed with long skinny boats with dual outriggers, looking like brightly painted water skaters.\n\nAnd then they are down on the runway at NAIA, Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Guards and cops of various stripes are ambling around with M-16s or pistol-handled pump shotguns, wearing burnooses fashioned from handkerchiefs clamped to the head with American baseball caps. A man dressed in a radiant white uniform stands below the ragged maw of the jetway holding his hands downwards with fluorescent orange sticks in them, like Christ dispensing mercy on a world of sinners. Sulfurous, fulminating tropical air begins to leak in through the jumbo's air vents. Everything moistens and wilts.\n\nHe is in Manila. He takes his passport out of his shirt pocket. It says, RANDALL LAWRENCE WATERHOUSE.\n\n\n\nThis is how Epiphyte Corporation came into existence:\n\n``I am channeling the bad shit!'' Avi said.\n\nThe number came through on Randy's pager while he was sitting around a table in a grubhouse along the coast with his girlfriend's crowd. A place where, every day, they laser-printed fresh menus on 100% recycled imitation parchment, where oscilloscope tracings of neon-colored sauces scribbled across the plates, and the entrees were towering, architectonic stacks of rare ingredients carved into gemlike prisms. Randy had spent the entire meal trying to resist the temptation to invite one of Charlene's friends (any one of them, it didn't matter) out on the sidewalk for a fistfight.\n\nHe glanced at his pager expecting to see the number of the Three Siblings Computer Center, which was where he worked (technically, still does). The fell digits of Avi's phone number penetrated the core of his being in the same way that 666 would a fundamentalist's.\n\nFifteen seconds later, Randy was out on the sidewalk, swiping his card through a pay phone like an assassin drawing a single-edged razor blade across the throat of a tubby politician.\n\n``The power is coming down from On High,'' Avi continued. ``Tonight, it happens to be coming through me--you poor bastard.''\n\n``What do you want me to do?'' Randy asked, adopting a cold, almost hostile tone to mask sick excitement.\n\n``Buy a ticket to Manila,'' Avi said.\n\n``I have to talk it over with Charlene first,'' Randy said.\n\n``You don't even believe that yourself,'' Avi said.\n\n``Charlene and I have a long-standing relationsh--''\n\n``It's been ten years. You haven't married her. Fill in the fucking blanks.''\n\n(Seventy-two hours later, he would be in Manila, looking at the One-Note Flute.)\n\n``Everyone in Asia is wondering when the Philippines is finally going to get its shit together,'' Avi said, ``it's the question of the nineties.''\n\n(The One-Note Flute is the first thing you see when you make it through passport control.)\n\n``I flashed on this when I was standing in line at Passport Control at Ninoy Aquino International Airport,'' Avi said, compressing that entire name into a single, sharply articulated burst. ``You know how they have different lanes?''\n\n``I guess so,'' Randy said. A parallelpiped of seared tuna did a barrel roll in his gullet. He felt a perverse craving for a double ice-cream cone. He did not travel as much as Avi, and had only a vague idea of what he meant by lanes.\n\n``You know. One lane for citizens. One for foreigners. Maybe one for diplomats.''\n\n(Now, standing there waiting to have his passport stamped, Randy can see it clearly. For once he doesn't mind the wait. He gets in a lane next to the OCW lane and studies them. They are Epiphyte Corp.'s market. Mostly young women, many of them fashionably dressed, but still with a kind of Catholic boarding-school demureness. Exhausted from long flights, tired of the wait, they slump, then suddenly straighten up and elevate their fine chins, as if an invisible nun were making her way up the line whacking their manicured knuckles with a ruler.)\n\nBut seventy-two hours ago he hadn't really understood what Avi meant by lanes, so he just said, ``Yeah, I've seen the lane thing.''\n\n``At Manila, they have a whole lane just for returning OCWs!''\n\n``OCWs?''\n\n``Overseas Contract Workers. Filipinos working abroad--because the economy of the Philippines is so lame. As maids and nannies in Saudi. Nurses and anesthesiologists in the States. Singers in Hong Kong, whores in Bangkok.''\n\n``Whores in Bangkok?'' Randy had been there, at least, and his mind reeled at the concept of importing prostitutes to Thailand.\n\n``The Filipino women are more beautiful,'' Avi said quietly, ``and have a ferocity that makes them more interesting, to the innately masochistic business traveler, than all those grinning Thai bimbos.'' Both of them knew that this was complete bullshit; Avi was a family man and had no firsthand experience whereof he spoke. Randy didn't call him on it, though. As long as Avi retained this extemporaneous bullshitting ability there was a better than even chance of all of them making fuck-you money.\n\n(Now that he's here, it is tempting to speculate as to which of the girls in the OCW lane are hustlers. But he can't see that going anywhere but wrong, so he squares his shoulders and marches toward the yellow line.\n\nThe government has set up glass display cases in the concourse leading from passport control to the security barrier. The cases contain artifacts demonstrating the glories of pre-Magellan Filipino culture. The first one of these contains the piece de resistance: a rustic hand-carved musical instrument labeled with a long and unreadable name in Tagalog. Underneath that, in smaller letters, is the English translation: ONE-NOTE FLUTE.)\n\n``See? The Philippines is innately hedged,'' Avi said. ``You know how rare that is? When you find an innately hedged environment, Randy, you lunge into it like a rabid ferret going into a pipe full of raw meat.''\n\nA word about Avi: his father's people had just barely gotten out of Prague. As Central European Jews went, they were fairly typical. The only thing about them that was really anomalous was that they were still alive. But his mother's people were unbelievably peculiar New Mexican crypto-Jews who had been living on mesas, dodging Jesuits, shooting rattlesnakes and eating jimson weed for three hundred years; they looked like Indians and talked like cowboys. In his relations with other people, therefore, Avi dithered. Most of the time he was courtly and correct in a way that was deeply impressive to businesspeople--Nipponese ones expecially--but there were these eruptions, from time to time, as if he'd been dipping into the loco weed. Randy had learned to deal with it, which is why Avi called him at times like this.\n\n``Oh, calm down!'' Randy said. He watched a tanned girl rollerblade past him, on her way up from the beach. ``Innately hedged?''\n\n``As long as the Philippines don't have their shit together, there'll be plenty of OCWs. They will want to communicate with their families--the Filipinos are incredibly family-oriented. They make Jews look like a bunch of alienated loners.''\n\n``Okay. You know more about both groups than I do.''\n\n``They are sentimental and affectionate in a way that's very easy for us to sneer at.''\n\n``You don't have to be defensive,'' Randy said, ``I'm not sneering at them.''\n\n``When you hear their song dedications on the radio, you'll sneer,'' Avi said. ``But frankly, we could take some pointers from the Pinoys on this front.''\n\n``You are so close to being sanctimonious right now--''\n\n``I apologize,'' Avi said, with absolute sincerity. Avi's wife had been pregnant almost continuously for the four years they'd been married. He was getting more religiously observant daily and couldn't make it through a conversation without mentioning the Holocaust. Randy was a bachelor who was just about to break up with the chick he'd been living with.\n\n``I believe you, Avi,'' Randy said. ``Is it a problem with you if I buy a business-class ticket?''\n\nAvi didn't hear him, so Randy assumed that meant yes. ``As long as that's the case, there will be a big market for Pinoy-grams.''\n\n``Pinoy-grams?''\n\n``For god's sake, don't say it out loud! I'm filling out the trademark application as we speak,'' Avi said. Randy could hear a rattling sound in the background, computer keys impacting so rapidly it sounded like Avi was simply holding the keyboard between his pale, spindly hands and shaking it violently up and down. ``But if the Filipinos do get their shit together, then we see explosive growth in telecoms, as in any other Arday.''\n\n``Arday?''\n\n``R-D-A-E. Rapidly Developing Asian Economy. Either way, we win.''\n\n``I gather you want to do something with telecoms?''\n\n``Bingo.'' In the background, a baby began to cough and cry. ``Gotta go,'' Avi said, ``Shlomo's asthma is spiking again. Take down this fingerprint.''\n\n``Fingerprint?''\n\n``For my encryption key. For e-mail.''\n\n``Ordo?''\n\n``Yeah.''\n\nRandy took out a ballpoint pen and, finding no paper in his pocket, poised it over the palm of his hand. ``Shoot.''\n\n``67 81 A4 AE FF 40 25 9B 43 0E 29 8D 56 60 E3 2F.'' Then Avi hung up the phone.\n\nRandy went back into the restaurant. On his way back, he asked the waiter to bring him a half-bottle of good red wine. Charlene heard him, and glowered. Randy was still thinking about innate ferocity, and did not see it in her face; only a schoolmarmishness common among all of her friends. My god! I have to get out of California, he realized.\n\n\nSEAWEED\n\nWoman holds baby\n\nEyes pale as a muzzle flash\n\nBand chimes frozen tears\n\nThe fourth marines is marching downhill to the strains of John Philip Sousa, which ought to be second nature to a Marine. But the Fourth Marines have been in Shanghai (which ain't no halls of Montezuma nor shores of Tripoli) for too long, longer than Marines should ever stay in one place, and Bobby's already seen his sergeant, one Frick, throw up from opium withdrawal.\n\nA Marine band is several Shanghai blocks ahead. Bobby's platoon can hear the thumpity-thump of the big drums and the piercing noises from piccolos and glockenspiels but he can't follow the tune. Corporal Shaftoe is effectively their leader, because Sergeant Frick is useless.\n\nShaftoe marches alongside the formation, supposedly to keep an eye on his men, but mostly he's just staring at Shanghai.\n\nShanghai stares back, and mostly gives them a standing ovation. Of course there is a type of young street rowdy who makes it a point of honor to let the Marines know he isn't scared of them, and they are jeering the Marines from a safe distance, and setting off strings of firecrackers, which does nothing to steady anyone's nerves. The Europeans are applauding--a whole chorus line of Russian dancing girls from Delmonte's is showing thigh and blowing kisses. But most of the Chinese look pretty stonefaced, which--Bobby suspects--means they're scared shitless.\n\nThe worst thing is the women carrying half-white babies. A few of these women are rabid, hysterical, throwing themselves into formations of massed Marines, undeterred by rifle butts. But most of them are stoic: they stand with their light-eyed babies and glare, searching the ranks and files for the guilty party. They've all heard about what happened upriver in Nanjing when the Nips came there, and they know that when it's all over, the only trace that they and their babies ever existed may be a really bad memory in the mind of some American Marine.\n\nIt works for Shaftoe: he has hunted deer in Wisconsin and seen them limping across the snow, bleeding to death. He saw a man die in basic training at Parris Island. He has seen whole tangles of bodies in the Yangtze, downstream of where the Nipponese were prosecuting the China Incident, and he has seen refugees from places like Nanjing starve to death in the gutters of Shanghai. He has himself killed people who were trying to storm the riverboats it was his duty to protect. He thinks that he has never seen, and will never see, anything as terrible as those stone-faced Chinese women holding their white babies, not even blinking as the firecrackers explode all around them.\n\nUntil, that is, he looks into the faces of certain Marines who stare into that crowd and see their own faces looking back at them, pudgy with baby fat and streaked with tears. Some of them seem to think it's all a joke. But many of the Marines who march out of their empty barracks that morning sane and solid men, have, by the time they reach the gunboats waiting for them at the Bund, gone mad. They don't show it. But Shaftoe can see in their eyes that something has given way inside.\n\nThe very best men in the regiment are in a foul mood. The ones like Shaftoe, who didn't get involved with the Chinese women, are still leaving plenty behind: houses with maids and shoeshine boys and coolies, with women and opium for almost nothing. They don't know where they are being shipped off to, but it's safe to say that their twenty-one dollars a month won't go as far. They'll be in barracks and they'll have to learn to polish their own boots again. When the gangplanks are drawn in from the stone edge of the Bund, they are cut off from a whole world that they'll never see again, a world where they were kings. Now they are Marines again. It's okay with Shaftoe, who wants to be a Marine. But many of the men have become middle-aged here, and don't.\n\nThe guilty men duck belowdecks. Shaftoe remains on the deck of the gunboat, which casts off from the Bund, headed for the cruiser Augusta, which awaits in mid-channel.\n\nThe Bund is jammed with onlookers in a riot of differently colored clothing, so one patch of uniform drab catches his eye: a group of Nip soldiers who've come down to bid their Yank counterparts a sarcastic farewell. Shaftoe scans the group looking for someone tall and bulky, and picks him out easily. Goto Dengo's waving to him.\n\nShaftoe takes his helmet off and waves back. Then, on impulse, just for the hell of it, he winds up and flings the helmet directly at Goto Dengo's head. The throw goes awry and Goto Dengo has to knock down about a dozen of his comrades in order to catch it. All of them seem to think that it is a high honor, as well as tremendously amusing, to be knocked down by Goto Dengo.\n\nTwenty seconds later, a comet sails up out of the flesh cosmos of the Bund and bounces on the wooden deck of the gunboat--a hell of a throw. Goto Dengo is showing off his follow-through. The projectile is a rock with a white streamer wrapped around it. Shaftoe runs over and snatches it. The streamer is one of those thousand-stitch headbands (supposedly; he's taken a few off of unconscious Nips, but he's never bothered to count the stitches) that they tie around their heads as a good-luck charm; it has a meatball in the center and some Nip writing to either side. He unties it from around the rock. In so doing he realizes, suddenly, that it's not a rock after all; it is a hand grenade! But good old Goto Dengo was just joking--he didn't pull the pin. A nice souvenir for Bobby Shaftoe.\n\nShaftoe's first haiku (December 1940) was a quick and dirty adaptation of the Marine Creed:\n\nThis is my rifle\n\nThere are many like it but\n\nThis rifle is mine.\n\nHe wrote it under the following circumstances: Shaftoe and the rest of Fourth Marines were stationed in Shanghai so that they could guard the International Settlement and work as muscle on the gunboats of the Yangtze River Patrol. His platoon had just come back from the Last Patrol: a thousand-mile reconnaissance-in-force all the way up past what was left of Nanjing, to Hankow, and back. Marines had been doing this ever since the Boxer Rebellion, through civil wars and everything else. But towards the end of 1940, what with the Nips basically running all of northeast China now, the politicians back in D.C. had finally thrown in the towel and told the China Marines not to steam up the Yangtze any more.\n\nNow, the Old Breed Marines like Frick claimed they could tell the difference between organized brigands; armed mobs of starving peasants; rogue Nationalists; Communist guerrillas; and the irregular forces in the pay of warlords. But to Bobby Shaftoe they were all just crazy, armed slopes who wanted a piece of the Yangtze River Patrol. The Last Patrol had been a wild trip. But it was over and they were back in Shanghai now, the safest place you could be in China, and about a hundred times more dangerous than the most dangerous place you could be in America. They had climbed off the gunboat six hours ago, gone to a bar, and not come out until just now, when they had decided it was high time they went to a whorehouse. On their way, they happened to pass this Nip restaurant.\n\nBobby Shaftoe had looked in the windows of the place before, and watched the man with the knife, trying to figure out what the hell he was doing. It looked a hell of a lot like he was cutting up uncooked fish and putting the raw meat on bullets of rice and handing it over to the Nips on the other side of the counter, who were wolfing it down.\n\nIt had to be some kind of optical illusion. The fish must have been precooked in the back room.\n\nThis had been nagging at Shaftoe for about a year. As he and the other horny drunk Marines went by the place, he slowed down to peer through the window, trying to gather more evidence. He could swear that some of that fish looked ruby red, which it wouldn't have been if it were cooked.\n\nOne of his buddies, Rhodes from Shreveport, noticed him looking. He dared Shaftoe to go in there and sit down at that bar. Then another private, Gowicki from Pittsburgh, double-dared him!\n\nShaftoe sucked his teeth and considered the matter. He had already made up his mind that he was going to do it. He was a sniper scout, and it was in his nature to do crazy shit like this; but it was also part of his training to scan the terrain carefully before venturing in.\n\nThe restaurant was three-quarters full, and everyone in the place was a uniformed member of the Nipponese military. At the bar where the man was cutting up the apparently raw fish, there was a marked concentration of officers; if you only had one grenade, that's where you'd throw it. Most of the place was filled with long tables where enlisted men sat, drinking noodle soup from steaming urns. Shaftoe paid particular attention to these, because they were the ones who were going to be beating the shit out of him in about sixty seconds. Some were there alone, with reading material. A cluster of them, back in one corner, were paying attention to one fellow who was apparently telling a joke or story.\n\nThe longer Shaftoe spent reconnoitering the place, the more convinced Rhodes and Gowicki became that he was actually going to do it. They became excited and called for the other Marines, who had gone ahead of them down the block, headed for that whorehouse.\n\nShaftoe saw the others coming back--his tactical reserve. ``What the fuck,'' he said, and went into the restaurant. Behind him, he could hear the others shouting excitedly; they couldn't believe he was doing it. When Shaftoe stepped over the threshold of that Nip restaurant, he passed into the realm of legend.\n\nAll the Nips looked up at him when he came in the door. If they were surprised, they didn't show it. The chef behind the counter began to holler out some kind of ritual greeting, which faltered and trailed off as he got a look at what had just come in. The fellow in the back of the room--a husky, pink-cheeked Nip--continued telling his joke or story or whatever it was.\n\nShaftoe nodded to no one in particular, then stepped to the nearest empty chair at the bar and sat down.\n\nOther Marines would have waited until the whole squad had assembled. Then they would have invaded the restaurant en masse, knocked over a few chairs, spilled some soup. But Shaftoe had seized the initiative before the others could do any such thing and gone in by himself, as a sniper scout was supposed to do. It was not just because he was a sniper scout, though. It was also because he was Bobby Shaftoe, and he was sincerely curious about this place, and if he could, he wanted to spend a few calm minutes in here and learn a few things about it before the fun started.\n\nIt helped, of course, that Shaftoe was a quiet and contemplative drunk, not a dangerous explosive drunk. He must have reeked of beer (those Krauts in Tsingtao cranked out a brew whose taste took him right back to Wisconsin, and he was homesick). But he wasn't hollering or knocking things over.\n\nThe chef was busy crafting one of his little morsels and pretended to ignore Shaftoe. The other men at the counter stared coldly at Shaftoe for a while, then turned their attentions back to their food. Shaftoe looked at the array of raw fish laid out on shaved ice behind the bar, then looked around the room. The guy back in the corner was talking in short bursts, reading from a notebook. He would speak maybe ten or twenty words, and then his little audience would turn to one another and grin, or grimace, or sometimes even make a patter of applause. He wasn't delivering his material like a dirty joke. He spoke precisely and expressively.\n\nFuck! He was reading poetry! Shaftoe had no idea what he was saying, but he could tell, by the sound of it, that it must be poetry. Didn't rhyme though. But the Nips did everything queerly.\n\nHe noticed that the chef was glaring at him. He cleared his throat, which was useless since he couldn't speak Nip. He looked at some of that ruby red fish behind the bar, pointed to it, held up two fingers.\n\nEveryone was startled that the American had actually placed an order. The tension was broken, only a little. The chef went to work and produced two morsels, which he served up on a wooden pedestal.\n\nShaftoe had been trained to eat insects, and to bite the heads off chickens, so he figured he could handle this. He picked the morsels up in his fingers, just like the Nips were doing, and ate them. They were good. He ordered two more, of another variety. The guy in the corner kept reading poetry. Shaftoe ate his morsels and then ordered some more. For perhaps ten seconds, between the taste of the fish and the sound of the poetry, he actually felt comfortable here, and forgot that he was merely instigating a vicious racial brawl.\n\nThe third order looked different: laid over the top of the raw fish were thin translucent sheets of some kind of moist, glistening material. It looked sort of like butcher paper soaked in oil. Shaftoe gawked at it for a while, trying to identify it, but it looked like no foodstuff he knew of. He glanced left and right, hoping that one of the Nips had ordered the same stuff, so that he could watch and learn the right way to eat it. No luck.\n\nHell, they were officers. Maybe one of them spoke a little English. `` 'Scuse me. What's this?'' Shaftoe said, peeling up one corner of the eerie membrane.\n\nThe chef looked up at him nervously, then scanned the bar, polling the customers. Discussion ensued. Finally, a Nip officer at the end of the bar, a naval lieutenant, stood up and spoke to Bobby Shaftoe.\n\n``Seaweed.''\n\nShaftoe did not particularly like the lieutenant's tone of voice--hostile and sullen. This, combined with the look on his face, seemed to say, You'll never understand it, you farmer, so why don't you just think of it as seaweed.\n\nShaftoe folded his hands primly in his lap, regarded the seaweed for a few moments, and then looked up at the lieutenant, who was still gazing at him expressionlessly. ``What kind of seaweed, sir?'' he said.\n\nSignificant glances began flying around the restaurant, like semaphores before a naval engagement. The poetry reading seemed to have stopped, and a migration of enlisted men had begun from the back of the room. Meanwhile the lieutenant translated Shaftoe's inquiry to the others, who discussed it in some detail, as if it were a major policy initiative from Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nThe lieutenant and the chef exchanged words. Then the lieutenant looked at Shaftoe again. ``He say, you pay now.'' The chef held up one hand and rubbed his fingers and thumb together.\n\nA year of working the Yangtze River Patrol had given Bobby Shaftoe nerves of titanium, and unlimited faith in his comrades, and so he resisted the impulse to turn his head and look out the window. He already knew exactly what he would see: Marines, shoulder to shoulder, ready to die for him. He scratched the new tattoo on his forearm: a dragon. His dirty fingernails, passing over the fresh scabs, made a rasping sound in the utterly silent restaurant.\n\n``You didn't answer my question,'' Shaftoe said, pronouncing the words with a drunk's precision.\n\nThe lieutenant translated this into Nipponese. More discussion. But this time it was curt and decisive. Shaftoe could tell that they were about to bounce him. He squared his shoulders.\n\nThe Nips were good; they mounted an organized charge out the door, onto the sidewalk, and engaged the Marines, before anyone actually laid a hand on Shaftoe. This spoiling attack prevented the Marines from invading the restaurant proper, which would have disturbed the officers' meal and, with any luck, led to untold property damage. Shaftoe then felt himself being grabbed from behind by at least three people and hoisted into the air. He made eye contact with the lieutenant while this was happening, and shouted: ``Are you bullshitting me about the seaweed?''\n\nAs brawls went, the only remarkable part of this one was the way he was carried out to the street before he could actually get started. Then it was like all the other street fights he'd been in with Nip soldiers in Shanghai. These all came down to American brawn (you didn't get picked for the Fourth Regiment unless you were an impressive-looking six-footer) versus that Nipponese chop-socky.\n\nShaftoe wasn't a boxer. He was a wrestler. This was to his advantage. The other Marines would put up their dukes and try to fight it out--Marquis of Queensberry style--no match for chop-socky. Shaftoe had no illusions about his boxing, so he would just put his head down and charge like a bull, take a few blows to the face on his way in, but usually get a solid hold on his opponent and slam him into the cobblestones. Usually that shook the Nip up enough that Shaftoe could get him in a full-nelson or a hammerlock and get him to cry uncle.\n\nThe guys who were carrying him out of the restaurant got jumped by Marines as soon as they were in the open. Shaftoe found himself going up against an opponent who was at least as tall as he was, which was unusual. This one had a solid build, too. Not like a sumo wrestler. More like a football player--a lineman, with a bit of a gut. He was a strong S.O.B. and Shaftoe knew right away that he was in for a real scrape. The guy had a different style of wrestling from the American, which (as Shaftoe learned the hard way) included some illegal maneuvers: partial strangulation and powerful, short punches to major nerve centers. The gulf between Shaftoe's mind and body, already wedged open by alcohol, was yanked open to a chasm by these techniques. He ended up lying on the sidewalk, helpless and paralyzed, staring up into the chubby face of his opponent. This was (he realized) the same guy who'd been sitting in the corner of the restaurant reading poetry. He was a good wrestler for a poet. Or maybe vice versa.\n\n``It is not seaweed,'' said the big Nip. He had a look on his face like a naughty schoolkid getting away with something. ``The English word is maybe calabash?'' Then he turned and walked back into the restaurant.\n\nSo much for legend. What none of the other Marines knows is that this was not the last encounter between Bobby Shaftoe and Goto Dengo. The incident left Shaftoe with any number of nagging questions about subjects as diverse as seaweed, poetry, and chop-socky. He sought out Goto Dengo after that, which was not that hard--he just paid some Chinese boys to follow the conspicuous Nip around town and file daily reports. From this he learned that Goto Dengo and some of his comrades gathered every morning in a certain park to practice their chop-socky. After making sure that his will was in order and writing a last letter to his parents and siblings in Oconomowoc, Shaftoe went to that park one morning, reintroduced himself to the surprised Goto Dengo, and made arrangements to serve as human punching bag. They found his self-defense skills hilariously primitive but admired his resilience, and so, for the small cost of a few broken ribs and digits, Bobby Shaftoe got a preliminary course in the particular type of chop-socky favored by Goto Dengo, which is called judo. Over time, this even led to a few social engagements in bars, and restaurants, where Shaftoe learned to recognize four types of seaweed, three types of fish eggs, and several flavors of Nip poetry. Of course he had no idea what the fuck they were saying, but he could count syllables, which, as far as he could tell, is about all there is to Nip poetry appreciation.\n\nNot that this--or any other knowledge of their culture--is going to do him any good now that it will soon be his job to kill them.\n\nIn return, Shaftoe taught Goto Dengo how not to throw like a girl. A lot of the Nips are good at baseball and so it was hilarious, even to them, to see their burly friend pushing ineffectually at a baseball. But it was Shaftoe who taught Goto Dengo to stand sideways, to rotate his shoulders, and to follow through. He's paid a lot of attention to the big Nip's throwing form during the last year, and maybe that's why the image of Goto Dengo planting his feet on the ashlars of the Bund, winding up, throwing the streamer-wrapped grenade, and following through almost daintily on one combat-booted foot stays in Shaftoe's mind all the way to Manila and beyond.\n\n\n\nA couple of days into the voyage it becomes apparent that Sergeant Frick has forgotten how to shine his boots. Every night he puts them on the deck beside his bunk, like he's expecting a coolie to come around and shine them up during the night. Every morning he wakes up and finds them in a sorrier state than before. After a few days he starts to draw reprimands from On High, starts to get a lot of potato-peeling duty.\n\nNow in and of itself this is forgivable. Frick started out his career chasing bandolier-draped desperadoes away from mail trains on the High Chaparral, for God's sake. In '27 he got shipped off to Shanghai on very short notice, and no doubt had to display some adaptability. Fine. And now he's on this miserable pre-Great War cruiser and it's a little hard on him. Fine. But he does not take all of this with the dignity that is demanded of Marines by Marines. He whines about it. He lets himself get humiliated. He gets angry. A lot of the other old China Marines see things his way.\n\nOne day Bobby Shaftoe is up on the deck of the destroyer tossing the old horsehide around with a couple of the other young Marines when he sees a few of these older guys accumulating into a sort of human booger on the afterdeck. He can tell by the looks on their faces and by their gestures that they are bellyaching.\n\nShaftoe hears a couple of the ship's crew talking to each other nearby. ``What the hell is wrong with those Marines?'' one of them says. The other one shakes his head sadly, like a doctor who has just seen a patient's eyeballs roll up into their sockets. ``Those poor bastards have gone Asiatic,'' he says.\n\nAnd then they turn and look at Shaftoe.\n\nThat evening, at mess, Bobby Shaftoe gulps his food down double-time, then stands up and approaches the table where those Old Breed Marines are sullenly gathered. ``Begging your pardon, Sergeant!'' he hollers. ``Request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''\n\nFrick's mouth drops open, revealing a half-chewed plug of boiled beef. ``Whud you say, Corporal?''\n\nThe mess has gone silent. ``Respectfully request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''\n\nFrick is not the quickest guy in the world even when he's sober, and it's pretty obvious, just from looking at his pupils, that he and his comrades have brought some opium aboard. ``Wull, uh, I guess so,'' he says. He looks around at his crew of gripers, who are a little confused and a little amused. He unlaces his boots. Bobby Shaftoe takes those disgraceful things away and returns a bit later with them resplendently shined. By this time, Frick has gotten high and mighty. ``Wull, those boots look real good, Corporal Shaftoe,'' he says in a brassy voice. ``Darned if you ain't as good a shoe-shiner as my coolie boy was.''\n\nAt lights out, Frick and crew are short-sheeted. Various other, ruder practical jokes ensue during the nighttime. One of them gets jumped in his bunk and beaten by unspecified attackers. The brass call a surprise inspection the next morning and cuss them out. The ``gone Asiatic'' crew spend most of the next day gathered in a cluster, watching each other's backs.\n\nAround midday, Frick finally gets it through his head that all of this was triggered by Shaftoe's gesture, and that Shaftoe knew, all along, what was going to happen. So he rushes Bobby Shaftoe up on the deck and tries to throw him over the rail.\n\nShaftoe's warned at the last minute by one of his compadres, and spins around just enough to throw off Frick's attack. Frick caroms off the rail, turns around, and tries to grab Shaftoe's nuts. Shaftoe pokes him in the eye, which straightens him right up. They back away from each other. The opening formalities having been finished; they put up their dukes.\n\nFrick and Shaftoe box for a couple of rounds. A large crowd of Marines gathers. On most of their cards, Frick is winning the fight. Frick was always dim-witted, and is now crazy to boot, but he knows his way around a boxing ring, and he has forty pounds on Shaftoe.\n\nShaftoe puts up with it until Frick socks him pretty hard in the mouth and gives him a bloody lip.\n\n``How far are we from Manila?'' Shaftoe hollers. This question, as usual, leaves Sergeant Frick confused and bewildered, and straightens him up for a moment.\n\n``Two days,'' answers one of the ship's officers.\n\n``Well, goddamn,'' Bobby Shaftoe says. ``How'm I gonna kiss my girl with this fat lip?''\n\nFrick answers, ``Just go out and find a cheaper one.''\n\nThat's all he needs. Shaftoe puts his head down and charges in on Frick, hollering like a Nip. Before Frick can get his brain in gear, Bobby Shaftoe has him wrapped up in one of those chop-socky holds that Goto Dengo taught him in Shanghai. He works his way up Frick's body to a choke-hold and then clamps down until Sergeant Frick's lips turn the color of the inside of an oyster shell. Then he hangs Frick over the rail, holding him upside-down by the ankles, until Frick recovers enough to shout, ``Uncle!''\n\nA disciplinary proceeding is hastily called. Shaftoe is found guilty of being courteous (by shining Frick's boots) and defending the life of a Marine (himself) from a crazed attacker. The crazed attacker goes straight to the brig. Within a few hours, the noises Frick makes lets all of the Marines know what opium withdrawal feels like.\n\nSo Sergeant Frick does not get to see their entrance into Manila Bay. Shaftoe almost feels sorry for the poor bastard.\n\nThe island of Luzon lies to port all day long, a black hulk barely visible through the haze, with glimpses of palm trees and beaches down below. All of the Marines have been this way before and so they can pick out the Cordillera Central up north, and later the Zambales Mountains, which eventually plunge down to meet the sea near Subic Bay. Subic triggers a barrage of salty anecdotes. The ship does not put in there, but continues to swing southward around Bata'an, turning inland toward the entrance of Manila Bay. The ship reeks of shoe polish, talcum powder, and after-shave lotion; the Fourth Marines may have specialized in whoring and opium abuse, but they've always been known as the best-looking Marines in the Corps.\n\nThey pass by Corregidor. An island shaped like a bead of water on a waxed boot, it is gently rounded in the middle but steeply sloping into the water. It has a long, bony, dry tail that trails off at one end. The Marines know that the island is riddled with tunnels and bristling with terrible guns, but the only sign of these fortifications is the clusters of concrete barracks up in the hills, housing the men who serve the weapons. A tangle of antennas rises up above Topside. Their shapes are familiar to Shaftoe, because many of the same antennas rose above Station Alpha in Shanghai, and he had to take them apart and load them into the truck.\n\nThere is a giant limestone cliff descending nearly into the sea, and at the base of it is the entrance to the tunnel where all the spooks and radio men have their hideaway. Nearby is a dock, quite busy at the moment, with supplies being offloaded from civilian transports and stacked right there on the beach. This detail is noticed by all of the Marines as a positive sign of approaching war. Augusta drops anchor in the cove, and all of that tarp-wrapped radio stuff is unloaded into launches and taken to that dock, along with all of the odd pencil-necked Navy men who tended that gear in Shanghai.\n\nThe swell dies as they pass Corregidor and enter the bay. Greenish-brown algae floats in swirls and curlicues near the surface. Navy ships lay brown ropes of smoke across the still sea. Undisturbed by wind, these unfold into rugged shapes like translucent mountain ranges. They pass the big military base at Cavite--a sheet of land so low and flat that its boundary with the water would be invisible except for the picket line of palm trees. A few hangars and water towers rise from it, and low dark clusters of barracks farther inland. Manila is dead ahead of them, still veiled in haze. It is getting on toward evening.\n\nThen the haze dissolves, the atmosphere suddenly becomes as limpid as a child's eyes, and for about an hour they can see to infinity. They are steaming into an arena of immense thunderheads with lightning corkscrewing down through them all around. Flat grey clouds like shards of broken slate peek out between anvils. Behind them are higher clouds vaulting halfway to the moon, glowing pink and salmon in the light of the setting sun. Behind that, more clouds nestled within banks of humidity like Christmas ornaments wrapped in tissue paper, expanses of blue sky, more thunderheads exchanging bolts of lightning twenty miles long. Skies nested within skies nested within skies.\n\nIt was cold up there in Shanghai, and it's gotten warmer every day since. Some days it's even been hot and muggy. But around the time Manila heaves into view, a warm breeze springs up over the deck and all of the Marines sigh, as if they have all ejaculated in unison.\n\nManila's perfume\n\nFanned by the coconut palms\n\nThe thighs of Glory\n\nManila's spreading tile roofs have a mestizo shape about them, half-Spanish and half-Chinese. The city has a concave seawall with a flat promenade on the top. Strollers turn and wave to the Marines; some of them blow kisses. A wedding party is gushing down the steps of a church and across the boulevard to the seawall, where they are getting their pictures taken in the flattering peach-colored light of the sunset. The men are in their fancy, gauzy Filipino shirts, or in U.S. military uniforms. The women are in spectacular gowns and dresses. The Marines holler and whistle at them and the women turn towards them, hitching up their skirts slightly so that they won't trip, and wave enthusiastically. The Marines get woozy and practically fall overboard.\n\nAs their ship is easing into its dock, a crescent-shaped formation of flying fish erupts from the water. It moves away like a dune being blown across the desert. The fish are silver and leaf-shaped. Each one strikes the water with a metallic click, and the clicks merge into a crisp ripping noise. The crescent glides beneath a pier, flowing around its pilings, and disappears in the shadows underneath.\n\nManila, the Pearl of the Orient, early on a Sunday evening, the 7th of December, 1941. In Hawaii, on the other side of the Date Line, it is only just past midnight. Bobby Shaftoe and his comrades have a few hours of freedom. The city is modern, prosperous, English-speaking, and Christian, by far the wealthiest and most advanced city in Asia, practically like being back home in the States. For all its Catholicity, it has areas that seem to have been designed, from the foundation-stones upwards, to the specifications of horny sailors. You get to those parts of town by turning right once your feet are on dry land.\n\nBobby Shaftoe turns left, politely excuses himself past a legion of excited prostitutes, and sets his course on the looming walls of Intramuros. He stops only to buy a sheaf of roses from a vendor in the park, who is doing land-office business. The park and the walls above it are crowded with strolling lovers, the men mostly in uniforms and the women in demure but stunning dresses, twirling parasols on their shoulders.\n\nA couple of fellows driving horse-drawn taxis want to do business with Bobby Shaftoe but he turns them down. A taxi will only get him there faster, and he is too nervous to get there fast. He walks through a gate in the wall and into the old Spanish city.\n\nIntramuros is a maze of buff-colored stone walls rising abruptly from narrow streets. The first-floor windows along the sidewalks are guarded by black ironwork cages. The bars swell, swirl, and sprout finedly hammered leaves. The second stories hang out overhead, sporting gas lights that are just now being lit by servants with long, smoking poles. The sound of laughter and music drifts out of the windows above, and when he passes by the archways that open into the inner courtyards, he can smell flowers back in the gardens.\n\nDamned if he can tell these places apart. He remembers the street name of Magallanes, because Glory told him once it was the same thing as ``Magellan.'' And he remembers the view of the cathedral from the Pascuals' window. He wanders around a block a couple of times, certain that he is close. Then he hears an exaltation of girlish laughter coming from a second-story window, and moves toward it like a jellyfish sucked into an intake pipe. It all comes together. This is the place. The girls are all gossiping, in English, about one of their instructors. He does not hear Glory's voice but he thinks he hears her laughter.\n\n``Glory!'' he says. Then he says it louder. If they hear him, they pay him no mind. Finally he winds up and flings the bouquet of roses like a potato-masher grenade over the wooden railing, through a narrow gap between the mother-of-pearl shutters, and into the room.\n\nMiraculous silence from within the room, and then gales of laughter. The nacre shutters part with slow, agonizing coyness. A girl of nineteen steps out onto the balcony. She is dressed in the uniform of a nursing student. It is as white as starlight shining on the North Pole. She has let her long black hair down to brush it, and it stirs languidly in the evening breeze. The last ruddy light of the sunset makes her face glow like a coal. She hides behind the bouquet for a moment, buries her nose in it, inhales deeply, peeking out at him over the blossoms with her black eyes. Then she lowers the bouquet gradually to reveal her high cheeks, her perfect little nose, the fantastic sculpture of her lips, and teeth, white but fetchingly crooked, barely visible. She is smiling.\n\n``Jesus H. Christ,'' Bobby Shaftoe says, ``your cheekbones are like a fucking snowplow.''\n\nShe puts her finger to her lips. The gesture of anything touching Glory's lips puts an invisible spear through Shaftoe's chest. She eyes him for a while, establishing, in her own mind, that she has the boy's attention and that he is not going anywhere. Then she turns her back on him. The light grazes her buttocks, showing nothing but suggesting cleavage. She goes back inside and the shutter glides shut behind her.\n\nSuddenly the room full of girls becomes quiet, except for occasional ripples of suppressed laughter. Shaftoe bites his tongue. They are screwing it all up. Mr. or Mrs. Pascual will notice their silence and become suspicious.\n\nIronwork clangs and a big gate swings open. The porter beckons him inside. Shaftoe follows the old fellow down the black, arched tunnel of the porte-cochere. The hard soles of his shiny black shoes skid on the cobblestones. A horse back in the stable whinnies at the smell of his aftershave. Sleepy American music, slow-dance stuff from the Armed Forces station, spills tinnily from a radio in the porter's nook.\n\nFlowering vines grow up the stone walls of the courtyard. It is a tidy, quiet, enclosed world, almost like being indoors. The porter waves him in the direction of one of the stairways that lead up to the second floor. Glory calls it the entresuelo and says that it's really a floor between the floors, but it looks like a full-fledged, regular floor to Bobby Shaftoe. He mounts the steps and looks up to see Mr. Pascual standing there, a tiny bald man with glasses and a trim little mustache. He is wearing a short-sleeved shirt, American style, and khaki trousers, and slippers, and is holding a glass of San Miguel in one hand and a cigarette in the other. ``Private Shaftoe! Welcome back,'' he says.\n\nSo. Glory has decided to play this one by the book. The Pascuals have been alerted. A few hours of socializing now stand between Bobby Shaftoe and his girl. But a Marine is never fazed by such setbacks.\n\n``Begging your pardon, Mr. Pascual, but I am a corporal now.''\n\nMr. Pascual puts his cigarette in his mouth and shakes Corporal Shaftoe's hand. ``Well, congratulations! I just saw your uncle Jack last week. I don't think he had any idea you were on your way back.''\n\n``It was a surprise to everyone, sir,'' Bobby Shaftoe says.\n\nNow they are on a raised walkway that runs around the courtyard. Only livestock and servants live at ground level. Mr. Pascual leads them around to a door that takes them into the entresuelo. The walls here are rough stone, the ceilings are simple painted planks. They pass through a dark, somber office where Mr. Pascual's father and grandfather used to receive the managers of the family's haciendas and plantations. For a moment, Bobby Shaftoe gets his hopes up. This level has a few rooms that back in the old days were apartments for high-ranking servants, bachelor uncles, and spinster aunts. Now that the hacienda business ain't what it used to be, the Pascuals are renting them out to female students. Perhaps Mr. Pascual is leading him directly to Glory.\n\nBut this goes the way of all foolish, horny illusions as Shaftoe finds himself at the foot of a vast staircase of polished nara wood. He can see pressed-tin ceiling up there, chandeliers, and the imposing superstructure of Mrs. Pascual, contained within a mighty bodice that looks like something dreamed up by naval engineers. They ascend the stairs into the antesala, which according to Glory is strictly for casual, drop-in visitors but is fancier than any room Bobby Shaftoe has ever seen. There are big vases and pots all over the place, supposedly old, and supposedly from Japan and China. A fresh breeze runs through; he looks out a window and sees, neatly framed in it, the green dome of the cathedral with its Celtic cross on top, just as he remembered it. Mrs. Pascual holds out her hand and Shaftoe clasps it. ``Mrs. Pascual,'' he says, ``thank you for welcoming me into your home.''\n\n``Please sit down,'' she says, ``we want to hear everything.''\n\nShaftoe sits in a fancy chair next to the piano, adjust his trousers a bit so that they will not cramp his erect penis, checks his shave. It probably has a few good hours left. A wing of airplanes drones overhead. Mrs. Pascual is giving instructions to the maid in Tagalog. Shaftoe examines the crusted lacerations on his knuckles and wonders whether Mrs. Pascual has the slightest idea of what she would be in for if he really told her everything. Perhaps a little anecdote about hand-to-hand combat with Chinese river pirates on the banks of the Yangtze would break the ice. Through a door and down the hall, he can see a corner of the family chapel, all Gothic arches, a gilded altar, and in front of it an embroidered kneeler worn threadbare by the patellas of Mrs. Pascual.\n\nCigarettes are brought round, stacked in a large lacquer box like artillery shells in a crate. They drink tea and exchange small talk for what seems like about thirty-six hours. Mrs. Pascual wants to be reassured, over and over again, that everything is fine and that there will not be a war. Mr. Pascual obviously believes that war is just around the corner, and mostly broods. Business has been good lately. He and Jack Shaftoe, Bobby's uncle, have been shipping a lot of stuff between here and Singapore. But business will get a lot worse soon, he thinks.\n\nGlory appears. She has changed out of her student's uniform and into a dress. Bobby Shaftoe nearly topples backward out of the window. Mrs. Pascual formally reintroduces them. Bobby Shaftoe kisses Glory's hand in what he thinks is more than likely a very gallant gesture. He's glad he did, because Glory is palming a tiny wadded-up note which ends up in his hand.\n\nGlory takes a seat and is duly issued her own teacup. Another eternity of small talk. Mr. Pascual asks him for the eighty-seventh time whether he has touched base with Uncle Jack yet, and Shaftoe reiterates that he literally just stepped off the boat and will certainly see Uncle Jack tomorrow morning. He excuses himself to the bathroom, which is an old-fashioned two-holer mounted above deep shafts that must descend all the way to hell. He unwads and reads Glory's note, memorizes the instructions, tears it up and sprinkles it down the hole.\n\nMrs. Pascual allows the two young lovers a full half hour of ``private'' time together, meaning that the Pascuals leave the room and only come back every five minutes or so to check up on them. There is a painfully elaborate and lengthy good-bye ceremony which ends in Shaftoe returning to the street and Glory waving to him from her balcony.\n\nHalf an hour later, they are doing tongue judo in the back of a horse-drawn taxi galloping over the cobblestones toward the nightclubs of Malate. The extraction of Glory from the Pascual residence was a simple matter for a highly motivated China Marine and a squadron of saucy nursing students.\n\nBut Glory must be kissing him with her eyes open because all of a sudden she wriggles loose and says to the taxi driver, ``Stop! Please stop, sir!''\n\n``What is it?'' Shaftoe says blurrily. He looks around and sees nothing but a great big old stone church looming up above them. This brings a preliminary stab of fear. But the church is dark, there's no Filipinas in long dresses, no Marines in dress uniforms, it can't be his wedding.\n\n``I want to show you something,'' Glory says, and clambers down out of the taxi. Shaftoe has to pursue her into the place--the Church of San Augustin. He's gone by this pile many times but he never reckoned he would come inside--on a date.\n\nShe stands at the bottom of a huge staircase and says, ``See?''\n\nShaftoe looks up into darkness, thinks there might be a stained-glass window or two up there, maybe a Laceration of Christ or an Impalement of the Blessed Thorax, but--\n\n``Look down,'' Glory says, and taps one miniature foot against the first tread of the staircase. It is a single great big huge slab of granite.\n\n``Looks like ten or twenty tons of rock there I'd estimate,'' he says authoritatively.\n\n``It came from Mexico.''\n\n``Ah, go on!''\n\nGlory smiles at him. ``Carry me up the stairs.'' And in case Shaftoe's thinking of refusing, she sort of falls into him, and he has no choice but to catch her up in his arms. She traps his nape in the crook of her arm, the better to pull her face close to his, but what he remembers is how the silk of her sleeve feels against the freshly shaved skin of his neck. He begins the ascent. Glory doesn't weigh much, but after four steps he has broken a fine sweat. She is watching him, from four inches away, for signs of fatigue, and he feels himself blushing. Good thing that the whole staircase is lit up by about two candles. There's a lovely bust of a thorn-crowned Jesus with long parallel blood-drops running down his face, and on the right--\n\n``These giant stones you are walking on were quarried in Mexico, centuries and centuries ago, before America was even a country. They were brought over in the bottoms of the Manila Galleons, as ballast.'' She pronounces it bayast.\n\n``I'll be damned.''\n\n``When those galleons arrived, the stones were brought out of their bellies, one by one, and taken here to the Church of San Agustin, and piled up. Each stone on top of the last year's stone. Until finally after many, many years this staircase was finished.''\n\nAfter a while it seems to Shaftoe as though it's going to take at least that many years to reach the top of the damn thing. The summit is adorned with a life-sized Jesus carrying a cross that appears to be at least as heavy as one of those stair-treads. So who's he to complain? Then Glory says, ``Now carry me down, so you will remember the story.''\n\n``You think I'm some horny jarhead who won't remember a story unless it's got a pretty girl in it?''\n\n``Yes,'' Glory says, and laughs in his face. He carries her down to the bottom again. Then, before she goes off on some other tangent, he carries her straight out the door and into the taxi.\n\nBobby Shaftoe is not one to lose his cool in the heat of action, but the rest of the evening is a blurry fever dream to him. Only a few impressions penetrate the haze: alighting from the taxi in front of a waterfront hotel; all of the other boys gaping at Glory; Bobby Shaftoe glaring at them, threatening to teach them some manners. Slow dancing with Glory in the ballroom, Glory's silk-clad thigh gradually slipping between his legs, her firm body pressing harder and harder against his. Strolling along the seawall, hand in hand beneath the starlight. Noticing that the tide is out. Exchanging a look. Carrying her down from the seawall to the thin strip of rocky beach beneath it.\n\nBy the time he is actually fucking her, he has more or less lost consciousness, he is off in some fantastic, libidinal dream. He and Glory fuck without the slightest hesitation, without any doubts, without any troublesome thinking whatsoever. Their bodies have spontaneously merged, like a pair of drops running together on a windowpane. If he is thinking anything at all, it is that his entire life has culminated in this moment. His upbringing in Oconomowoc, high school prom night, deer hunting in the Upper Peninsula, Parris Island boot camp, all of the brawls and struggles in China, his duel with Sergeant Frick, they are wood behind the point of a spear.\n\nSirens are blowing somewhere. He startles back to awareness. Has he been here all night long, holding Glory up against the seawall, her thighs wrapped around his waist? That would not be possible. The tide hasn't come in at all.\n\n``What is it?'' she says. Her hands are clasped around the back of his neck. She lets go and runs them down his chest.\n\nStill holding her up, his hands making a sling under her warm and flawless ass, Shaftoe backs away from the seawall and turns around on the beach, looking at the sky. He sees searchlights beginning to come on. And it ain't no Hollywood premiere.\n\n``It's war, baby,'' he says.\n\n\n\nFORAYS\n\nThe lobby of the manila hotel is about the size of a football field. It smells like last year's perfume, rare tropical orchids, and bug spray. There is a metal detector set up at the front door, because the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe happens to be staying here for a couple of days. Big Africans in good suits stand around the place in clusters of two and three. Mini-throngs of Nipponese tourists, in their Bermuda shorts, sandals and white socks, have lodged themselves in the deep, thick, wide sofas and sit quietly, waiting for a prearranged signal. Upper-class Filipino children brandish cylindrical potato chip canisters like tribal chieftains carrying ceremonial maces. A dignified old bellman carrying a hand-pumped tank circulates around the defensive perimeter and silently sprays insecticide against the baseboard. Enter Randall Lawrence Waterhouse, in a turquoise polo shirt embroidered with the logo of one of the bankrupt high-tech companies that he and Avi have founded, and relaxed-fit blue jeans held up with suspenders, and bulky athletic shoes that once were white.\n\nAs soon as he got through the formalities at the airport, he perceived that the Philippines are, like Mexico, one of those countries where Shoes Matter. He approaches the registration counter quickly so that the ravishing young woman in the navy-blue uniform will not see his feet. A couple of bellhops are engaged in a pathetic, Sisyphean contest with his bag, which has roughly the dimensions and mass of a two-drawer filing cabinet. ``You will not be able to find technical books there,'' Avi told him, ``bring anything you might conceivably need.''\n\nRandy's suite is a bedroom and living room, both with fourteen-foot ceilings, and a corridor along one side containing several closets and various plumbing-related technologies. The entire thing is lined in some kind of tropical hardwood stained to a lovely glowing auburn, which would be dismal in the northern latitudes but, here, gives it a cozy and cool feeling. The two main rooms each have huge windows with tiny signs by the latch handles warning of tropical insects. Each room is defended from its windows by a multilayered system of interlocking barriers: incredibly massive wooden shutters that rumble back and forth on tracks, like freight trains maneuvering in a switching yard; a second layer of shutters consisting of two-inch squares of nacre held in a polished wooden grid, sliding on its own set of tracks; window sheers, and finally, heavy-gauge blackout curtains, each suspended from its own set of clanging industrial rails.\n\nHe orders up a large pot of coffee, which barely keeps him awake long enough to unpack. It is late afternoon. Purple clouds tumble out of the surrounding mountains with the palpable momentum of volcanic mudflows and turn half of the sky into a blank wall striped with vertical bolts of lightning; the walls of the hotel room flash with it as though paparazzi are working outside the window. Below, food vendors in Rizal Park run up and down the sidewalks to get out of the rain, which falls, as it has been doing for about half a millennium, on the sloping black walls of Intramuros. If those walls did not run in straight lines they could be mistaken for a natural freak of geology: ridges of bare, dark volcanic rock erupting from the grass like teeth from gums. The walls have dovetail-shaped notches that converge to old gun emplacements, providing interlocking fields of fire across a dry moat.\n\nLiving in the States, you never see anything older than about two and a half centuries, and you have to visit the eastern fringe of the country to see that. The business traveler's world of airports and taxicabs looks the same everywhere. Randy never really believes he's in a different country until he sees something like Intramuros, and then he has to stand there like an idiot for a long time, ruminating.\n\nRight now, across the Pacific Ocean, in a small, tasteful Victorian town located a third of the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles, computers are seizing up, crucial files are disappearing, and e-mail is careening into intergalactic space, because Randy Waterhouse is not there to keep an eye on things. The town in question sports three small colleges: one founded by the State of California and two founded by Protestant denominations that are now actively reviled by the majority of their faculty. Taken together these colleges--the Three Siblings--comprise an academic center of middling importance. Their computer systems are linked into one. They exchange teachers and students. From time to time they host academic conferences. This part of California has beaches, mountains, redwood forests, vineyards, golf courses, and sprawling penal facilities all over the place. There are plenty of three- and four-star hotel rooms, and the Three Siblings, taken together, have enough auditoria and meeting rooms to host a conference of several thousand.\n\nAvi's telephone call, some eighty hours ago, arrived in the middle of a major interdisciplinary conference called ``The Intermediate Phase (1939\u203a45) of the Global Hegemony Struggle of the Twentieth Century (Common Era).'' This is a bit of a mouthful and so it has been given a pithy nickname: ``War as Text.''\n\nPeople are coming from places like Amsterdam and Milan. The conference's organizing committee--which includes Randy's girlfriend, Charlene, who actually gives every indication of being his ex-girlfriend now--hired an artist in San Francisco to come up with a poster. He started with a black-and-white halftone photo of a haggard World War Two infantryman with a cigarette dangling from his lower lip. He worked this image over using a photocopier, blowing the halftone dots up into rough lumps, like rubber balls chewed by a dog, and wreaking any number of other distortions on it until it had an amazingly stark, striking, jagged appearance; the soldier's pale eyes turned an eerie white. Then he added a few elements in color: red lipstick, blue eyeshadow, and a trace of a red brassiere strap peeking out from the soldier's unbuttoned uniform shirt.\n\nThe poster won some kind of an award almost the moment it came out. This led to a press release, which in turn led to the poster's being enshrined by the news media as an Official Object of Controversy. An enterprising journalist managed to track down the soldier depicted in the original photograph--a decorated combat veteran and retired tool-and-die maker who, as it happened, was not merely alive but in excellent health, and, since the death of his wife from breast cancer, had spent his retirement roaming around the Deep South in his pickup truck, helping to rebuild black churches that had been torched by drunken yahoos.\n\nThe artist who had designed the poster then confessed that he had simply copied it from a book and had made no effort whatsoever to obtain permission--the entire concept of getting permission to use other people's work was faulty, since all art was derivative of other art. High-powered trial lawyers converged, like dive bombers, on the small town in Kentucky where the aggrieved veteran was up on the roof of a black church with a mouthful of nails, hammering down slabs of A/D exterior plywood and mumbling ``no comment'' to a horde of reporters down on the lawn. After a series of conferences in a room at the town's Holiday Inn, the veteran emerged, accompanied by one of the five most famous lawyers on the face of the planet, and announced that he was filing a civil suit against the Three Siblings that would, if it succeeded, turn them and their entire community into a flat, smoking abrasion in the earth's crust. He promised to split the proceeds between the black churches and various disabled veterans' and breast cancer research groups.\n\nThe organizing committee pulled the poster from circulation, which caused thousands of bootleg copies to go up on the World Wide Web and, in general, brought it to the attention of millions who never would have seen it otherwise. They also filed suit against the artist, whose net worth could be tallied up on the back of a ticket stub: he had assets of about a thousand dollars and debts (mostly student loans) amounting to sixty-five thousand.\n\nAll of this happened before the conference even began. Randy was aware of it only because Charlene had roped him into providing computer support for the conference, which meant setting up a Web site and e-mail access for the attendees. When all of this hit the news, e-mail began to flood in, and quickly jammed up all of the lines and filled up all of the disk capacity that Randy had spent the last month setting up.\n\nConferees began to arrive. A lot of them seemed to be sleeping in the house where Randy and Charlene had been living together for seven years. It was a big old Victorian house and there was plenty of room. They stumbled in from Heidelberg and Paris and Berkeley and Boston, then sat around Randy and Charlene's kitchen table drinking coffee and talking at great length about the Spectacle. Randy inferred that the Spectacle meant the poster furor, but as they went on and on about it, he sensed that they were using the word not in a conventional sense but as part of some academic jargon; that it carried a heavy load of shadings and connotations to them, none of which Randy would ever understand unless he became one of them.\n\nTo Charlene, and to all of the people attending War as Text, it was self-evident that the veteran who filed the lawsuit was the very worst kind of human being--just the sort they had gathered together to debunk, burn in effigy, and sweep into the ash-bin of posthistorical discourse. Randy had spent a lot of time around these people, and thought he'd gotten used to them, but during those days he had a headache all the time, from clenching his teeth, and he kept jumping to his feet in the middle of meals or conversations and going out for solitary walks. This was partly to keep himself from saying something undiplomatic, and partly as a childish but fruitless tactic to get the attention he craved from Charlene.\n\nHe knew the whole poster saga was going to be a disaster from early on. He kept warning Charlene and the others. They listened coolly, clinically, as if Randy were a test subject on the wrong side of a one-way mirror.\n\n\n\nRandy forces himself to stay awake long enough for it to get dark. Then he lies in bed for a few hours trying to sleep. The container port is just north of the hotel, and all night long, Rizal Boulevard, along the base of the old Spanish wall, is jammed from one end to the other with container-carrying semis. The whole city is a cauldron of internal combustion. Manila seems to have more pistons and exhaust pipes than the rest of the world combined. Even at two in the morning the hotel's seemingly unshakable mass hums and rattles from the seismic energy pouring from all of those motors. The noise detonates car alarms down in the hotel's lot. The noise of one alarm triggers others, and so on. It is not the noise that keeps Randy awake so much as the insane stupidity of this chain reaction. It is an object lesson: the kind of nightmarish, snowballing technological fuck-up that keeps hackers awake at night even when they can't hear the results.\n\nHe paws open a Heineken from his minibar and stands in front of the window, looking. Many of the trucks are adorned with brilliant displays of multicolored lights--not quite as flashy as those of the few jeepneys that scurry and jostle among them. Seeing so many people awake and working puts sleep out of the question.\n\nHe is too jet-lagged to accomplish anything that requires actual thought--but there is one important job he can do, which requires no thinking whatsoever. He starts up his laptop again. Seeming to levitate in the center of his dark room, the screen is a perfect rectangle of light the color of diluted milk, of a Nordic dawn. This light originates in small fluorescent tubes imprisoned in the polycarbonate coffin of his computer's display. It can only escape through a pane of glass, facing Randy, which is entirely covered by small transistors arranged in a grid, which let photons through, or don't, or let through only those of a particular wavelength, cracking the pale light into colors. By turning those transistors on and off according to some systematic plan, meaning is conveyed to Randy Waterhouse. A good filmmaker could convey a whole story to Randy by seizing control of those transistors for a couple of hours.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a lot more laptop computers floating around than there are filmmakers worth paying attention to. The transistors are almost never put into the hands of human beings. They are controlled, instead, by software. Randy used to be fascinated by software, but now he isn't. It's hard enough to find human beings who are interesting.\n\nThe pyramid and the eyeball appear. Randy spends so much time using Ordo now that he has his machine boot it up automatically.\n\nNowadays the laptop has only one function for Randy: he uses it to communicate with other people, through e-mail. When he communicates with Avi, he has to use Ordo, which is a tool for taking his ideas and converting them into streams of bits that are almost indistinguishable from white noise, so that they can be sent to Avi in privacy. In exchange, it receives noise from Avi and converts it into Avi's thoughts. At the moment, Epiphyte has no assets other than information--it is an idea, with some facts and data to back it up. This makes it eminently stealable. So encryption is definitely a good idea. The question is: how much paranoia is really appropriate?\n\nAvi sent him encrypted e-mail:\n\nWhen you get to Manila I would like you to generate a 4096-bit key pair and keep it on a floppy disk that you carry on your person at all times. Do not keep it on your hard disk. Anyone could break into your hotel room while you're out and steal that key.\n\nNow, Randy pulls down a menu and picks an item labeled: ``New key. . . . ''\n\nA box pops up giving him several KEY LENGTH options: 768 bits, 1024, 1536, 2048, 3072, or Custom. Randy picks the latter option and then, wearily, types in 4096.\n\nEven a 768-bit key requires vast resources to break. Add one bit, to make it 769 bits long, and it becomes twice as difficult. A 770-bit key is twice as difficult yet, and so on. By using 768-bit keys, Randy and Avi could keep their communications secret from nearly every entity in the world for at least the next several years. A 1024-bit key would be vastly, astronomically more difficult to break.\n\nSome people go so far as to use keys 2048 or even 3072 bits in length. These will stop the very best codebreakers on the face of the earth for astronomical periods of time, barring the invention of otherworldly technologies such as quantum computers. Most encryption software--even stuff written by extremely security-conscious cryptography experts--can't even handle keys larger than that. But Avi insists on using Ordo, generally considered the best encryption software in the world, because it can handle keys of unlimited length--as long as you don't mind waiting for it to crunch all the numbers.\n\nRandy begins typing. He is not bothering to look at the screen; he is staring out the window at the lights on the trucks and the jeepneys. He is only using one hand, just flailing away loosely at the keyboard.\n\nInside Randy's computer is a precise clock. Whenever he strikes a key, Ordo uses that clock to record the current time, down to microseconds. He hits a key at 03:05:56.935788 and he hits another one at 03:05:57.290664, or about .354876 seconds later. Another .372307 seconds later, he hits another one. Ordo keeps track of all of these intervals and discards the more significant digits (in this example the .35 and the .37) because these parts will tend to be similar from one event to the next.\n\nOrdo wants randomness. It only wants the least significant digits--say, the 76 and the 07 at the very ends of these numbers. It wants a whole lot of random numbers, and it wants them to be very, very random. It is taking somewhat random numbers and feeding them through hash functions that make them even more random. It is running statistical routines on the results to make sure that they contain no hidden patterns. It has breathtakingly high standards for randomness, and it will not stop asking Randy to whack on the keyboard until those standards are met.\n\nThe longer the key you are trying to generate, the longer this takes. Randy is trying to generate one that is ridiculously long. He has pointed out to Avi, in an encrypted e-mail message, that if every particle of matter in the universe could be used to construct one single cosmic supercomputer, and this computer was put to work trying to break a 4096-bit encryption key, it would take longer than the lifespan of the universe.\n\n``Using today's technology,'' Avi shot back, ``that is true. But what about quantum computers? And what if new mathematical techniques are developed that can simplify the factoring of large prime numbers?''\n\n``How long do you want these messages to remain secret?'' Randy asked, in his last message before leaving San Francisco. ``Five years? Ten years? Twenty-five years?''\n\nAfter he got to the hotel this afternoon, Randy decrypted and read Avi's answer. It is still hanging in front of his eyes, like the afterimage of a strobe:\n\nI want them to remain secret for as long as men are capable of evil.\n\nThe computer finally beeps. Randy rests his tired hand. Ordo politely warns him that it may be busy for a while, and then goes to work. It is searching the cosmos of pure numbers, looking for two big primes that can be multiplied by each other to produce a number 4096 bits long.\n\nIf you want your secrets to remain secret past the end of your life expectancy, then, in order to choose a key length, you have to be a futurist. You have to anticipate how much faster computers will get during this time. You must also be a student of politics. Because if the entire world were to become a police state obsessed with recovering old secrets, then vast resources might be thrown at the problem of factoring large prime numbers.\n\nSo the length of the key that you use is, in and of itself, a code of sorts. A knowledgeable government eavesdropper, noting Randy's and Avi's use of a 4096-bit key, will conclude one of the following:\n\n--Avi doesn't know what he's talking about. This can be ruled out with a bit of research into his past accomplishments. Or,\n\n--Avi is clinically paranoid. This can also be ruled out with some research. Or,\n\n--Avi is extremely optimistic about the future development of computer technology, or pessimistic about the political climate, or both. Or,\n\n--Avi has a planning horizon that extends over a period of at least a century.\n\nRandy paces around his room while his computer soars through number space. The shipping containers on the backs of those trucks bear exactly the same logos as the ones that used to fill the streets of South Seattle when a ship was unloading. To Randy this is oddly satisfying, as if, by making this crazy lunge across the Pacific, he has brought some kind of antipodal symmetry to his life. He has gone from the place where things are consumed to where they are produced, from a land where onanism has been enshrined at the highest levels of the society to one where cars have ``NO to contraception!'' stickers in their windows. It feels bizarrely right. He has not felt this way since Avi and he founded their first doomed business venture twelve years ago.\n\n\n\nRandy grew up in a college town in eastern Washington State, graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle, and landed a Clerk Typist II job at the library there--specifically the Interlibrary Loan Department--where his job was to process incoming loan requests mailed in from smaller libraries all over the region and, conversely, to mail out requests to other libraries. If nine-year-old Randy Waterhouse had been able to look into the future and see himself in this career, he would have been delighted beyond measure: the primary tool of the Interlibrary Loan Department was the Staple Remover. Young Randy had seen one of these devices in the hands of his fourth-grade teacher and been enthralled by its cunning and deadly appearance, so like the jaws of some futuristic robot dragon. He had, in fact, gone out of his way to staple things incorrectly just so he could prevail on his teacher to unstaple them, giving him another glimpse of the blood-chilling mandibles in action. He had gone so far as to steal a staple remover from an untended desk at church and then incorporate it into an Erector-set robot hunter-killer device with which he terrorized much of the neighborhood; its pit-viper yawn separated many a cheap plastic toy from its parts and accessories before the theft was discovered and Randy made an example of before God and man. Now, in the Interlibrary Loan office, Randy had not just one but several staple removers in his desk drawer and was actually obligated to use them for an hour or two a day.\n\nSince the UW library was well-endowed, its patrons didn't request books from other libraries unless they had been stolen from their own or were, in some way, peculiar. The ILL office (as Randy and his coworkers affectionately called it) had its regulars--people who had a whole lot of peculiar books on their wish lists. These people tended to be either tedious or scary or both. Randy always ended up dealing with the ``both'' subgroup, because Randy was the only Clerk Typist in the office who was not a lifer. It seemed clear that Randy, with his astronomy degree and his extensive knowledge of computers, would one day move on, whereas his coworkers did not harbor further ambitions. His larger sphere of interests, his somewhat broader concept of normalcy, was useful when certain patrons came into the office.\n\nBy the standards of many, Randy was himself a tedious, scary, obsessed character. He was not merely obsessed with science but also with fantasy role-playing games. The only way he could tolerate working at such a stupid job for a couple of years was that his off time was completely occupied with enacting fantasy scenarios of a depth and complexity that exercised all of the cranial circuitry that was so conspicuously going to waste in the ILL office. He was part of a group that would meet every Friday night and play until sometime on Sunday. The other stalwarts in the group were a computer science/music double major named Chester, and a history grad student named Avi.\n\nWhen a new master's degree candidate named Andrew Loeb walked into the ILL office one day, with a certain glint in his eye, and produced a three-inch-thick stack of precisely typed request forms from his shitty old knapsack, he was recognized immediately as being of a particular type, and shunted in the direction of Randy Waterhouse. It was an instant meeting of minds, though Randy did not fully realize this until the books that Loeb had requested began to arrive on the trolley from the mail room.\n\nAndy Loeb's project was to figure out the energy budgets of the local Indian tribes. A human body has to expend a certain amount of energy just to keep breathing and to maintain its body temperature. This figure goes up when it gets cold or when the body in question is doing work. The only way to obtain that energy is by eating food. Some foods have a higher energy content than others. For example, trout is highly nutritious but so low in fat and carbohydrates that you can starve to death eating it three times a day. Other foods might have lots of energy, but might require so much work to obtain and prepare that eating them would be a losing proposition, BTU-wise. Andy Loeb was trying to figure out what foods had historically been eaten by certain Northwest Indian tribes, how much energy they expended to get these foods and how much they obtained by eating them. He wanted to do this calculation for coastal Indians like the Salish (who had easy access to seafood) and for inland ones like the Cayuse (who didn't) as part of an extremely convoluted plan to prove some sort of point about the relative standards of living of these tribes and how this affected their cultural development (coastal tribes made lots of fantastically detailed art and inland ones occasionally scratched stick figures on rocks).\n\nTo Andrew Loeb it was an exercise in meta-historical scholarship. To Randy Waterhouse, it sounded like the beginnings of a pretty cool game. Strangle a muskrat and you get 136 Energy Points. Lose the muskrat and your core temp drops another degree.\n\nAndy was nothing if not methodical and so he had simply looked up every book that had ever been written on such topics, and every book mentioned in those books' bibliographies, yea, even unto four or five generations; checked out all of them that were available locally; and ordered the rest from ILL. All of the latter passed across Randy's desk. Randy read some and skimmed all. He got to learn about how much blubber the Arctic explorers had to eat in order to keep from starving to death. He perused detailed specifications for Army C-rations. After a while, he actually began sneaking into the photocopy room and making copies of key data.\n\nIn order to run a realistic fantasy role-playing game, you had to keep track of how much food the imaginary characters were getting and how much trouble was involved in getting it. Characters passing across the Gobi desert in November of the year 5000 B.C. would have to spend more time worrying about food than, say, ones who were traveling across central Illinois in 1950.\n\nRandy was hardly the first game designer to notice this. There were a few incredibly stupid games in which you didn't have to think about food, but Randy and his friends disdained them. In all of the games that he participated in, or that he himself designed, you had to devote a realistic amount of effort to getting food for your character. But it was not easy to determine what was realistic. Like most designers, Randy got over the problem by slapping together a few rudimentary equations that he basically just pulled out of thin air. But in the books, articles, and dissertations that Andrew Loeb was borrowing through ILL, he found exactly the raw data that a mathematically inclined person would need to come up with a sophisticated rules system based on scientific fact.\n\nStimulating all of the physical processes going on in each character's body was out of the question, especially in a game where you might be dealing with armies of a hundred thousand men. Even a crude simulation, tracking only a few variables and using simple equations, would involve a nightmarish amount of paperwork if you did it all by hand. But all of this was happening in the mid-1980s, when personal computers had become cheap and ubiquitous. A computer could automatically track a large database and tell you whether each character was well-fed or starving. There was no reason not to do it on a computer.\n\nUnless, like Randy Waterhouse, you had such a shitty job that you couldn't afford a computer.\n\nOf course, there's a way to dodge any problem. The university had lots of computers. If Randy could get an account on one of them, he could write his program there and run it for free.\n\nUnfortunately, accounts were only available to students or faculty members, and Randy was neither.\n\nFortunately, he started dating a grad student named Charlene at just about this time.\n\nHow the hell did a generally keg-shaped guy, a hard scientist, working a dead-end Clerk Typist job, and spending all his spare time in the consummately nerdy pastime of fantasy role-playing games, end up in a relationship with a slender and not unattractive young liberal arts student who spent her spare time sea kayaking and going to foreign films? It must have been one of those opposites-attract kind of deals, a complementary relationship. They met, naturally, in the ILL office, where the highly intelligent but steady and soothing Randy helped the highly intelligent but scattered and flighty Charlene organize a messy heap of loan requests. He should have asked her out then and there, but he was shy. Second and third opportunities came along when the books she'd requested began to filter up from the mailroom, and finally he asked her out and they went to see a film together. Both of them turned out to be not just willing but eager, and possibly even desperate. Before they knew it, Randy had given Charlene a key to his apartment, and Charlene had given Randy the password to her free university computer account, and everything was just delightful.\n\nThe university computer system was better than no computer at all. But Randy was humiliated. Like every other high-powered academic computing network, this one was based on an industrial-strength operating system called UNIX, which had a learning curve like the Matterhorn, and lacked the cuddly and stylish features of the personal computers then coming into vogue. Randy had used it quite a bit as an undergraduate and knew his way around. Even so, learning how to write good code on the thing required a lot of time. His life had changed when Charlene had come along, and now it changed more: he dropped out of the fantasy role-playing game circuit altogether, stopped going to meetings of the Society for Creative Anachronism, and began to spend all of his free time either with Charlene or in front of a computer terminal. All in all, this was probably a change for the better. With Charlene, he did things he wouldn't have done otherwise, like getting exercise, or going to see live music. And at the computer, he was learning new skills, and he was creating something. It might be something completely useless, but at least he was creating.\n\nHe spent a lot of time talking to Andrew Loeb, who actually went out and did the stuff he was writing programs for; he'd disappear for a few days and come back all wobbly and haggard, with fish scales caught in his whiskers or dried animal blood under his fingernails. He'd ram down a couple of Big Macs, sleep for twenty-four hours, then meet Randy in a bar (Charlene wasn't comfortable with having him in the house) and talk learnedly of the difficulties of day-to-day life, aboriginal style. They argued about whether aborigines would eat the more disgusting parts of certain animals or throw them away. Andrew voted for yes. Randy disagreed--just because they were primitive didn't mean they couldn't have taste. Andrew accused him of being a romantic. Finally, to settle it, they went up into the mountains together, armed with nothing but knives and Andrew's collection of exquisitely crafted vermin snares. By the third night, Randy found himself seriously thinking about eating some insects. ``Q.E.D.,'' Andrew said.\n\nAnyway, Randy finished his software after a year and a half. It was a success; Chester and Avi liked it. Randy was moderately pleased at having built something so complicated that actually worked, but he had no illusions about its being good for anything. He was sort of embarrassed at having wasted so much time and mental energy on the project. But he knew that if he hadn't been writing code, he'd have spent the same amount of time playing games or going to Society for Creative Anachronism meetings in medieval drag, so it all zeroed out in the end. Spending the time in front of the computer was arguably better, because it had honed his programming skills, which had been pretty sharp to begin with. On the other hand, he'd done it all on the UNIX system, which was for scientists and engineers--not a savvy move in an age when all the money was in personal computers.\n\nChester and Randy had nicknamed Avi ``Avid,'' because he really, really liked fantasy games. Avi had always claimed that he played them as a way of understanding what it was really like to live in ancient times, and he was a maniac about historical authenticity. That was okay; they all had half-assed excuses, and Avi's historical acumen frequently came in handy.\n\nNot long after this, Avi graduated and disappeared, and popped up a few months later in Minneapolis, where he had gotten a job with a major publisher of fantasy role-playing games. He offered to buy Randy's game software for the astonishingly large sum of $1000 plus a small cut of future profits. Randy accepted the offer in its general outlines, asked Avi to send him a contract, then went out and found Andrew boiling some fish guts in a birchbark kettle atop a Weber grill on the roof of the apartment building where he lived. He wanted to give Andrew the good news, and to cut him in on the proceeds. What ensued was a really unpleasant conversation, standing up there in a pelting, spitting, wind-blown rain.\n\nTo begin with, Andrew took this deal far more seriously than Randy did. Randy saw it as a windfall, a lark. Andrew, who was the son of a lawyer, treated it as if it were a major corporate merger, and asked many tedious and niggling questions about the contract, which did not exist yet and which would probably cover a single piece of paper when it did. Randy didn't realize it at the time, but by asking so many questions for which Randy had no answers, Andrew was, in effect, arrogating to himself the role of Business Manager. He was implicitly forming a business partnership with Randy that did not, in fact, exist.\n\nFurthermore, Andrew didn't have the first notion of how much time and effort Randy had put into writing the code. Or (as Randy was to realize later) maybe he did. In any case, Andrew assumed from the get-go that he would share a fifty-fifty split with Randy, which was wildly out of proportion to the work he'd actually done on the project. Basically, Andrew acted as if all of the work he'd ever done on the subject of aboriginal dining habits was a part of this undertaking, and that it entitled him to an equal split.\n\nBy the time Randy extricated himself from this conversation, his mind was reeling. He had gone in with one view of reality and been radically challenged by another one that was clearly preposterous; but after an hour of Andrew's browbeating he was beginning to doubt himself. After two or three sleepless nights, he decided to call the whole thing off. A paltry few hundred dollars wasn't worth all of this agony.\n\nBut Andrew (who was, by now, represented by an associate of his father's Santa Barbara law firm) vehemently objected. He and Randy had, according to his lawyer, jointly created something that had economic value, and a failure on Randy's part to sell it at market value amounted to taking money out of Andrew's pocket. It had become an unbelievable Kafkaesque nightmare, and Randy could only withdraw to a corner table at his favorite pub, drink pints of stout (frequently in the company of Chester) and watch this fantastic psychodrama unfold. He had, he now realized, blundered into some serious domestic weirdness involving Andrew's family. It turned out that Andrew's parents were divorced and, long ago, had fought savagely over custody of him, their only child. Mom had turned into a hippie and joined a religious cult in Oregon and taken Andrew with her. It was rumored that this cult engaged in sexual abuse of children. Dad had hired private dicks to kidnap Andrew back and then showered him with material possessions to demonstrate his superior love. There had followed an interminable legal battle in which Dad had hired some rather fringey psychotherapists to hypnotize Andrew and get him to dredge up repressed memories of unspeakable and improbable horrors.\n\nThis was just the executive summary of a weird life that Randy only learned about in bits and pieces as the years went on. Later, he was to decide that Andrew's life had been fractally weird. That is, you could take any small piece of it and examine it in detail and it, in and of itself, would turn out to be just as complicated and weird as the whole thing in its entirety.\n\nAnyway Randy had blundered into this life and become enveloped in the weirdness. One of the young eager beavers in Andrew's dad's law firm decided, as a preemptive move, to obtain copies of all of Randy's computer files, which were still stored on the UW computer system. Needless to say, he went about it in a heavy-handed way, and when the university's legal department began to receive his sullen letters, it responded by informing both Andrew's lawyer, and Randy, that anyone who used the university's computer system to create a commercial product had to split the proceeds with the university. So now Randy was getting ominous letters from not one but two groups of deadly lawyers. Andrew then threatened to sue him for having made this blunder, which had halved the value of Andrew's share!\n\nIn the end, just to cut his losses and get out of it clean, Randy had to hire a lawyer of his own. The final cost to him was a hair more than five thousand dollars. The software was never sold to anyone, and indeed could not have been; it was so legally encumbered by that point that it would have been like trying to sell someone a rusty Volkswagen that had been dismantled and its parts hidden in attack dog kennels all over the world.\n\nIt was the only time in his life when he had ever thought about suicide. He did not think about it very hard, or very seriously, but he did think about it.\n\nWhen it was all over, Avi sent him a handwritten letter saying, ``I enjoyed doing business with you and look forward to continuing our relationship both as friends and, should opportunities arise, as creative partners.''\n\n\nINDIGO\n\n\n\nLawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the band are up on the deck of the Nevada one morning, playing the national anthem and watching the Stars and Stripes ratchet up the mast, when they are startled to find themselves in the midst of one hundred and ninety airplanes of unfamiliar design. Some of them are down low, traveling horizontally, and others are up high, plunging nearly straight down. The latter are going so fast that they appear to be falling apart; little bits are dropping off of them. It is terrible to see--some training exercise gone miserably awry. But they pull out of their suicidal trajectories in plenty of time. The bits that have fallen off of them plunge smoothly and purposefully, not tumbling and fluttering as chunks of debris would. They are coming down all over the place. Perversely, they all seem to be headed for the berthed ships. It is incredibly dangerous--they might hit someone! Lawrence is outraged.\n\nThere is a short-lived phenomenon taking place in one of the ships down the line. Lawrence turns to look at it. This is the first real explosion he's ever seen and so it takes him a long time to recognize it as such. He can play the very hardest glockenspiel parts with his eyes closed, and The Star Spangled Banner is much easier to ding than to sing.\n\nHis scanning eyes fasten, not on the source of the explosion, but on a couple of airplanes that are headed right toward them, skimming just above the water. Each drops a long skinny egg and then their tailplanes visibly move and they angle upwards and pass overhead. The rising sun shines directly through the glass of their canopies. Lawrence is able to look into the eyes of the pilot of one of the planes. He notes that it appears to be some sort of Asian gentleman.\n\nThis is an incredibly realistic training exercise--even down to the point of using ethnically correct pilots, and detonating fake explosives on the ships. Lawrence heartily approves. Things have just been too lax around this place.\n\nA tremendous shock comes up through the deck of the ship, making his feet and legs feel as if he had just jumped off a ten-foot precipice onto solid concrete. But he's just standing there flatfooted. It makes no sense at all.\n\nThe band have finished playing the national anthem and are looking about at the spectacle. Sirens and horns are speaking up all over the place, from the Nevada, from the Arizona in the next berth, from buildings onshore. Lawrence doesn't see any antiaircraft fire going up, doesn't see any familiar planes in the air. The explosions just keep coming. Lawrence wanders over to the rail and stares across a few yards of open water towards the Arizona.\n\nAnother one of those plunging airplanes drops a projectile that shoots straight down onto Arizona's deck but then, strangely, vanishes. Lawrence blinks and sees that it has left a neat bomb-shaped hole in the deck, just like a panicky Warner Brothers cartoon character passing at high speed through a planar structure such as a wall or ceiling. Fire jets from that hole for about a microsecond before the whole deck bulges up, disintegrating, and turns into a burgeoning globe of fire and blackness. Waterhouse is vaguely aware of a lot of stuff coming at him really fast. It is so big that he feels more like he is falling into it. He freezes up. It goes by him, over him, and through him. A terrible noise pierces his skull, a chord randomly struck, discordant but not without some kind of deranged harmony. Musical qualities aside, it is so goddamned loud that it almost kills him. He claps his hands over his ears.\n\nStill the noise is there, like red-hot knitting needles through the eardrums. Hell's Bells. He spins away from it, but it follows him. He has this big thick strap around his neck, sewn together at groin level where it supports a cup. Thrust into the cup is the central support of his glockenspiel, which stands in front of him like a lyre-shaped breastplate, huge fluffy tassels dangling gaily from the upper corners. Oddly, one of the tassels is burning. That isn't the only thing now wrong with the glockenspiel, but he can't quite make it out because his vision keeps getting obscured by something that must be wiped away every few moments. All he knows is that the glockenspiel has eaten a huge quantum of pure energy and been kicked up to some incredibly high state never before achieved by such an instrument; it is a burning, glowing, shrieking, ringing, radiating monster, a comet, an archangel, a tree of flaming magnesium, strapped to his body, standing on his groin. The energy is transmitted down its humming, buzzing central axis, through the cup, and into his genitals, which would be tumescing in other circumstances.\n\nLawrence spends some time wandering aimlessly around the deck. Eventually he has to help open a hatch for some men, and then he realizes that his hands are still clapped over his ears, and have been for a long time except for when he was wiping stuff out of his eyes. When he takes them off, the ringing has stopped, and he no longer hears airplanes. He was thinking that he wanted to go belowdecks, because the bad things are coming from the sky and he would like to get some big heavy permanent-seeming stuff between him and it, but a lot of sailors are taking the opposite view. He hears that they have been hit by one and maybe two of something that rhymes with ``torpedoes,'' and that they are trying to raise steam. Officers and noncoms, black and red with smoke and blood, keep deputizing him for different, extremely urgent tasks that he doesn't quite understand, not least because he keeps putting his hands over his ears.\n\nProbably half an hour goes by before he hits upon the idea of discarding his glockenspiel, which is, after all, just getting in the way. It was issued to him by the Navy with any number of stern warnings about the consequences of misusing it. Lawrence is conscientious about this kind of thing, dating back to when he was first given organ-playing privileges in West Point, Virginia. But at this point, for the first time in his life, as he stands there watching the Arizona burn and sink, he just says to himself: Well, to heck with it! He takes that glockenspiel out of its socket and has one last look at it, it is the last time in his life he will ever touch a glockenspiel. There is no point in saving it now anyway, he realizes; several of the bars have been bent. He flips it around and discovers that chunks of blackened, distorted metal have been impact-welded onto several of the bars. Really throwing caution to the winds now, he flings it overboard in the general direction of the Arizona, a military lyre of burnished steel that sings a thousand men to their resting places on the bottom of the harbor.\n\nAs it vanishes into a patch of burning oil, the second wave of attacking airplanes arrives. The Navy's antiaircraft guns finally open up and begin to rain shells down into the surrounding community and blow up occupied buildings. He can see human-shaped flames running around in the streets, pursued by people with blankets.\n\nThe rest of the day is spent, by Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the Navy, grappling with the fact that many two-dimensional structures on this and other ships, which were put into place to prevent various fluids from commingling (e.g. fuel and air) have holes in them, and not only that but a lot of shit is on fire too and things are more than a little smoky. Certain objects that are supposed to (a) remain horizontal and (b) support heavy things have ceased to do either.\n\nNevada's engineering section manages to raise steam in a couple of boilers and the captain tries to get the ship out of the harbor. As soon as she gets underway, she comes under concerted attack, mostly by dive bombers who are eager to sink her in the channel and block the harbor altogether. Eventually, the captain runs her aground rather than see this happen. Unfortunately, what Nevada has in common with most other naval vessels is that she is not really engineered to work from a stationary position, and consequently she is hit three more times by dive bombers. So it is a pretty exciting morning overall. As a member of the band who does not even have his instrument any more, Lawrence's duties are quite poorly defined, and he spends more time than he should watching the airplanes and the explosions. He has gone back to his earlier train of thought regarding societies and their efforts to outdo each other. It is very clear to him, as wave after wave of Nipponese dive bombers hurl themselves, with calligraphic precision, at the ship he is standing on, and as the cream of his society's navy burns and explodes and sinks, putting up virtually no resistance, that his society is going to have to rethink a thing or two.\n\n\n\nAt some point he burns his hand on something. It is his right hand, which is preferable--he is left-handed. Also, he becomes more clearly aware that a portion of Arizona has tried to take his scalp off. These are minor injuries by Pearl Harbor standards and he does not stay long in the hospital. The doctor warns him that the skin on his hand might contract and limit his fingers' range of motion. As soon as he can withstand the pain, Lawrence begins to play Bach's Art of Fugue in his lap whenever he is not otherwise occupied. Most of those tunes start out simple; you can easily picture old Johann Sebastian sitting there on the bench on a cold morning in Leipzig, one or two blockflote stops yanked out, left hand in his lap, a fat choirboy or two over in the corner heaving away on the bellows, faint gasping noises coming from all the leaks in the works, and Johann's right hand wandering aimlessly across the forbidding simplicity of the Great manual, stroking those cracked and yellowed elephant tusks, searching for some melody he hadn't already invented. That is good stuff for Lawrence right now, and so he makes his right hand go through the same motions as Johann's, even though it is a gauze-wrapped hand and he is using an upside-down dinner tray as a substitute for the keyboard, and he has to hum the music under his breath. When he really gets into it, his feet skid around and piston under the sheets, playing imaginary pedals, and his neighbors complain.\n\nHe is out of the hospital in a few days, just in time for him and the rest of Nevada's band to begin their new, wartime assignment. This was evidently something of a poser for the Navy's manpower experts. These musicians were (from a killing-Nips point of view) completely useless to begin with. As of 7 December, they no longer have even a functioning ship and most of them have lost their clarinets.\n\nStill, it isn't all about loading shells and pulling triggers. No large organization can kill Nips in any kind of systematic way without doing a nearly unbelievable amount of typing and filing. It is logical to suppose that men who can play the clarinet will not botch that kind of work any worse than anyone else. And so Waterhouse and his bandmates receive orders assigning them to what would appear to be one of the typing-and-filing branches of the Navy.\n\nThis is located in a building, not a ship. There are quite a few Navy people who sneer at the whole idea of working in a building, and Lawrence and some of the other recent recruits, eager to fit in, have gotten into the habit of copping the same attitude. But now that they have seen what happens to a ship when you detonate hundreds of pounds of high explosive on, in, and around it, Waterhouse and many others are reassessing their feelings about working in buildings. They report to their new post with high morale.\n\nTheir new commanding officer is not so cheerful, and his feelings appear to be shared by everyone in the entire section. The musicians are greeted without being welcomed and saluted without being honored. The people who have been working in this building--far from being overawed by their status as guys who not only worked on an actual ship until recently but furthermore have been very close to things that were exploding, burning, etc., and not as the result of routine lapses in judgment but because bad men deliberately made it happen--do not seem to feel that Lawrence and his bandmates deserve to be entrusted with this new work, whatever the hell it is.\n\nGlumly, almost despairingly, the commanding officer and his subordinates get the musicians squared away. Even if they don't have enough desks to go around, each man can at least have a chair at a table or counter. Some ingenuity is displayed in finding places for all the new arrivals. It is clear that these people are trying their best at what they considered to be a hopeless task.\n\nThen there is some talk about secrecy. A great deal of talk about it. They run through drills intended to test their ability to throw things away properly. This goes on for a long time and the longer it continues, without an explanation as to why, the more mysterious it becomes. The musicians, who were at first a little put out by their chilly reception, start to speculate amongst themselves as to what kind of an operation they have gotten themselves into now.\n\nFinally, one morning, the musicians are assembled in a classroom in front of the cleanest chalkboard Waterhouse has ever seen. The last few days have imbued him with just enough paranoia that he suspects it is that clean for a reason--erasing chalkboards is not to be taken lightly during wartime.\n\nThey are seated in little chairs with desks attached to them, desks designed for right-handers. Lawrence puts his notepad in his lap, then rests his bandaged right hand on the desk and begins to play a ditty from Art of Fugue, grimacing and even grunting with pain as his burned skin stretches and slides over his knuckles.\n\nSomeone chucks him on the shoulder. He opens his eyes to see that he is the only person in the room sitting down; an officer is on the deck. He stands up and his weak leg nearly buckles. When he finally gets himself fully to his feet, he sees that the officer (if he even is an officer) is out of uniform. Way out of uniform. He's wearing a bathrobe and smoking a pipe. The bathrobe is extraordinarily worn, and not in the sense of, say, a hospital or hotel bathrobe that gets laundered frequently. This thing hasn't been laundered in a long time, but boy has it seen some use. The elbows are worn out and the bottom of the right sleeve is ashy grey and slippery with graphite from being dragged back and forth, tens of thousands of times, across sheets of paper dense with number-two pencil work. The terrycloth has a dandruffy appearance, but it has nothing to do with exfoliation of the scalp; these flakes are way too big, and too geometric: rectangles and circular dots of oaktag, punched out of cards and tape respectively. The pipe went out a long time ago and the officer (or whatever he is) is not even pretending to worry about getting it relit. It is there just to give him something to bite down on, which he does as vigorously as a civil war infantryman having a leg sawed off.\n\nSome other fellow--one who actually bothered to shave, shower, and put on a uniform--introduces bathrobe man as Commander Shane-spelled-s-c-h-o-e-n, but Schoen is having none of it; he turns his back on them, exposing the back side of his bathrobe, which around the buttocks is worn transparent as a negligee. Reading from a notebook, he writes out the following in block letters:\n\n19 17 17 19 14 20 23 18 19 8 12 16 19 8 3\n\n21 8 25 18 14 18 6 3 18 8 15 18 22 18 11\n\nAround the time that the fourth or fifth number is going up on the chalkboard, Waterhouse feels the hairs standing up on the back of his neck. By the time the third group of five numbers is written out, he has not failed to notice that none of them is larger than 26--that being the number of letters in the alphabet. His heart is pounding more wildly than it did when Nipponese bombs were tracing parabolic trajectories toward the deck of the grounded Nevada. He pulls a pencil out of his pocket. Finding no paper handy, he writes down the numbers from 1 to 26 on the surface of his little writing desk.\n\nBy the time the man in the bathrobe is done writing out the last group of numbers, Waterhouse is already well into his frequency count. He wraps it up as Bathrobe Man is saying something along the lines of ``this might look like a meaningless sequence of numbers to you, but to a Nip naval officer it might look like something entirely different.'' Then the man laughs nervously, shakes his head sadly, squares his jaw resolutely, and runs through a litany of other emotion-laden expressions not a single one of which is appropriate here.\n\nWaterhouse's frequency count is simply a tally of how frequently each number appears on the blackboard. It looks like this:\n\n1  14 ||\n2  15 |\n3 ||  16 |\n4  17 ||\n5  18 ||||||\n6 |  19 ||||\n7  20 |\n8 ||||  21 |\n9  22 |\n10  23 |\n11 |  24\n12 |  25 |\n13  26\n\nThe most interesting thing about this is that ten of the possible symbols (viz. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 24, and 26) are not even used. Only sixteen different numbers appear in the message. Assuming each of those sixteen represents one and only one letter of the alphabet, this message has (Lawrence reckons in his head) 111136315345735680000 possible meanings. This is a funny number because it begins with four ones and ends with four zeroes; Lawrence snickers, wipes his nose, and gets on with it.\n\nThe most common number is 18. It probably represents the letter E. If he substitutes E into the message everywhere he sees an 18, then--\n\nWell, to be honest, then he'll have to write out the whole message again, substituting Es for 18s, and it will take a long time, and it might be time wasted because he might have guessed wrong. On the other hand, if he just restrains his mind to construe 18s as Es--an operation that he thinks of as being loosely analogous to changing the presets on a pipe organ's console--then what he sees in his mind's eye when he looks at the blackboard is\n\n19 17 17 19 14 20 23 E 19 8 12 16 19 8 3\n\n21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11\n\nwhich only has 10103301395066880000 possible meanings. This is a funny number too because of all those ones and zeroes--but it is an absolutely meaningless coincidence.\n\n``The science of making secret codes is called cryptography,'' Commander Schoen says, ``and the science of breaking them is cryptanalysis.'' Then he sighs, grapples visibly with some more widely divergent emotional states, and resignedly plods into the mandatory exercise of breaking these words down into their roots, which are either Latin or Greek (Lawrence isn't paying attention, doesn't care, only glimpses the stark word CRYPTO written in handsized capitals).\n\nThe opening sequence ``19 17 17 19'' is peculiar. 19, along with 8, is the second most common number in the list. 17 is only half as common. You can't have four vowels or four consonants in a row (unless the words are German) so either 17 is a vowel and 19 a consonant or the other way round. Since 19 appears more frequently (four times) in the message, it is more likely to be the vowel than 17 (which only appears twice). A is the most common vowel after E, so if he assumes that 19 is A, he gets\n\nA 17 17 A 14 20 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3\n\n21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11\n\n\nThis narrows it down quite a bit, to a mere 841941782922240000 possible answers. He's already reduced the solution space by a couple of orders of magnitude!\n\nSchoen has talked himself up into a disturbingly heavy sweat, now, and is almost bodily flinging himself into a historical overview of the science of CRYPTOLOGY, as the union of cryptography and cryptanalysis is called. There's some talk about an English fellow name of Wilkins, and book called Cryptonomicon that he wrote hundreds of years ago, but (perhaps because he doesn't rate the intelligence of his audience too highly) he goes very easy on the historical background, and jumps directly from Wilkins to Paul Revere's ``one if by land, two if by sea'' code. He even makes a mathematics in-joke about this being one of the earliest practical applications of binary notation. Lawrence dutifully brays and snorts, drawing an appalled look from the saxophonist seated in front of him.\n\nEarlier in his talk, the Schoen mentioned that this message was (in what's obviously a fictional scenario ginned up to make this mathematical exercise more interesting to a bunch of musicians who are assumed not to give a shit about math) addressed to a Nip naval officer. Given that context, Lawrence cannot but guess that the first word of the message is ATTACK. This would mean that 17 represented T, 14 C, and 20 K. When he fills these in, he gets\n\nA T T A C K 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3\n\n21 T 25 E C E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11\n\n\nand then the rest is so obvious he doesn't bother to write it out. He cannot restrain himself from jumping to his feet. He's so excited he forgets about the weak legs and topples over across a couple of his neighbors' desks, which makes a lot of noise.\n\n``Do you have a problem, sailor?'' says one of the officers in the corner, one who actually bothered to wear a uniform.\n\n``Sir! The message is, `Attack Pearl Harbor December Seven!' Sir!'' Lawrence shouts, and then sits down. His whole body is quivering with excitement. Adrenalin has taken over his body and mind. He could strangle twenty sumo wrestlers on the spot.\n\nCommander Schoen is completely impassive except that he blinks once, very slowly. He turns to one of his subordinates, who is standing against the wall with his hands clasped behind his back, and says, ``Get this one a copy of the Cryptonomicon. And a desk--as close to the coffee machine as possible. And why don't you promote the son of a bitch as long as you're at it.''\n\nThe part about the promotion turns out to be either military humor or further evidence of Commander Schoen's mental instability. Other than that small bit of drollery, the story of Waterhouse past this point, for the next ten months, is not much more complicated than the story of a bomb that has just been released from the belly of a plunging airplane. The barriers placed in his path (working his way through the Cryptonomicon, breaking the Nipponese Air Force Meteorological Code, breaking the Coral naval attache machine cipher, breaking Unnamed Nipponese Army Water Transport Code 3A, breaking the Greater East Asia Ministry Code) present about as much resistance as successive decks of a worm-eaten wooden frigate. Within a couple of months he is actually writing new chapters of the Cryptonomicon. People speak of it as though it were a book, but it's not. It is basically a compilation of all of the papers and notes that have drifted up in a particular corner of Commander Schoen's office over the roughly two-year period that he's been situated at Station Hypo, as this place is called.* It is everything that Commander Schoen knows about breaking codes, which amounts to everything that the United States of America knows. At any moment it could have been annihilated if a janitor had stepped into the room for a few minutes and tidied the place up. Understanding this, Commander Schoen's colleagues in the officers' ranks of Station Hypo have devised strenuous measures to prevent any type of tidying or hygienic operations, of any description, in the entire wing of the building that contains Commander Schoen's office. They know enough, in other words, to understand that the Cryptonomicon is terribly important, and they have the wit to take the measures necessary to keep it safe. Some of them actually consult it from time to time, and use its wisdom to break Nipponese messages, or even solve whole cryptosystems. But Waterhouse is the first guy to come along who is good enough to (at first) point out errors in what Schoen has written, and (soon) assemble the contents of the pile into something like an orderly work, and (eventually) add original material onto it.\n\n*``Hypo'' is a military way of saying the letter H. Bright boy Waterhouse infers that there must be at least seven others: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.\n\nAt some point Schoen takes him downstairs and leads him to the end of a long windowless corridor to a slab of a door guarded by hulking Myrmidons and lets him see the second coolest thing they've got at Pearl Harbor, a roomful of machinery from the Electrical Till Corporation that they use mainly for doing frequency counts on Nip intercepts.\n\nThe most remarkable machine* at Station Hypo, however--and the first coolest thing in Pearl Harbor--is even deeper in the cloaca of the building. It is contained in something that might be likened to a bank vault if it weren't all wired up with explosives so that its contents can be vaporized in the event of a total Nip invasion.\n\n*Assuming, provisionally, that Alan is wrong and that human brains are not machines.\n\nThis is the machine that Commander Schoen made, more than a year ago, for breaking the Nipponese cipher called Indigo. Apparently, as of the beginning of 1940, Schoen was a well-adjusted and mentally healthy young man into whose lap was dumped some great big long lists of numbers compiled from intercept stations around the Pacific (perhaps, Waterhouse thinks, Alpha, Bravo, etc.). These numbers were Nipponese messages that had been encrypted somehow--circumstantial evidence suggested that it had been done by some kind of machine. But absolutely nothing was known about the machine: whether it used gears or rotary switches or plugboards, or some combination thereof, or some other kind of mechanism that hadn't even been thought of by white people yet; how many such mechanisms it did or didn't use; specific details of how it used them. All that could be said was that these numbers, which seemed completely random, had been transmitted, perhaps even incorrectly. Other than that, Schoen had nothing--nothing--to work on.\n\nAs of the middle of 1941, then, this machine existed in this vault, here at Station Hypo. It existed because Schoen had built it. The machine perfectly decrypted every Indigo message that the intercept stations picked up, and was, therefore, necessarily an exact functional duplication of the Nipponese Indigo code machine, though neither Schoen nor any other American had ever laid eyes on one. Schoen had built the thing simply by looking at those great big long lists of essentially random numbers, and using some process of induction to figure it out. Somewhere along the line he had become totally debilitated psychologically, and begun to suffer nervous breakdowns at the rate of about one every week or two.\n\nAs of the actual outbreak of war with Nippon, Schoen is on disability, and taking lots of drugs. Waterhouse spends as much time with Schoen as he is allowed to, because he's pretty sure that whatever happened inside of Schoen's head, between when the lists of apparently random numbers were dumped into his lap and when he finished building his machine, is an example of a noncomputable process.\n\nWaterhouse's security clearance is upgraded about once a month, until it reaches the highest conceivable level (or so he thinks) which is Ultra/Magic. Ultra is what the Brits call the intelligence they get from having broken the German Enigma machine. Magic is what the Yanks call the intelligence they get from Indigo. In any case, Lawrence now gets to see the Ultra/Magic summaries, which are bound documents with dramatic, alternating red and black paragraphs printed on the front cover. Paragraph number three states:\n\nNO ACTION IS TO BE TAKEN ON INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED, REGARDLESS OF TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE, IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY.\n\nSeems clear enough, right? But Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse is not so damn sure.\n\n. . . IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING . . .\n\nAt about the same time, Waterhouse has made a realization about himself. He has found that he works best when he is not horny, which is to say in the day or so following ejaculation. So as a part of his duty to the United States he has begun to spend a lot of time in whorehouses. But he can't have that much actual sex on what is still a glockenspiel player's pay and so he limits himself to what are euphemistically called massages.\n\n. . . ACTION. . . EFFECT . . .REVEALING . . .\n\nThe words stay with him like the clap. He lies on his back during these massages, arms crossed over his eyes, mumbling the words to himself. Something bothers him. He has learned that when something bothers him in this particular way it usually leads to his writing a new paper. But first he has to do a lot of hard mental pick-and-shovel work.\n\nIt all comes to him, explosively, during the Battle of Midway, while he and his comrades are spending twenty-four hours a day down among those ETC machines, decrypting Yamamoto's messages, telling Nimitz exactly where to find the Nip fleet.\n\nWhat are the chances of Nimitz finding that fleet by accident? That's what Yamamoto must be asking himself.\n\nIt is all a question (oddly enough!) of information theory.\n\n. . .ACTION . . .\n\nWhat is an action? It might be anything. It might be something obvious like bombing a Nipponese military installation. Everyone would agree that this would constitute an action. But it might also be something like changing the course of an aircraft carrier by five degrees--or not doing so. Or having exactly the right package of forces off Midway to hammer the Nipponese invasion fleet. It could mean something much less dramatic, like canceling plans for an action. An action, in a certain sense, might even be the total absence of activity. Any of these might be rational responses, on the part of some commander, to INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED. But any of them might be observable by the Nipponese--and hence any of them would impart information to the Nipponese. How good might those Nips be at abstracting information from a noisy channel? Do they have any Schoens?\n\n. . . EFFECT . . .\n\nSo what if the Nips did observe it? What would the effect be exactly? And under what circumstances might the effect be REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY?\n\nIf the action is one that could never have happened unless the Americans were breaking Indigo, then it will constitute proof, to the Nipponese, that the Americans have broken it. The existence of the source--the machine that Commander Schoen built--will be revealed.\n\nWaterhouse trusts that no Americans will be that stupid. But what if it isn't that clear-cut? What if the action is one that would merely be really improbable unless the Americans were breaking the code? What if the Americans, in the long run, are just too damn lucky?\n\nAnd how closely can you play that game? A pair of loaded dice that comes up sevens every time is detected in a few throws. A pair that comes up sevens only one percent more frequently than a straight pair is harder to detect--you have to throw the dice many more times in order for your opponent to prove anything.\n\nIf the Nips keep getting ambushed--if they keep finding their own ambushes spoiled--if their merchant ships happen to cross paths with American subs more often than pure probability would suggest--how long until they figure it out?\n\nWaterhouse writes papers on the subject, keeps pestering people with them. Then, one day, Waterhouse receives a new set of orders.\n\nThe orders arrive encrypted into groups of five random-looking letters, printed out on the blue tissue paper that is used for top-secret cablegrams. The message has been encrypted in Washington using a one-time pad, which is a slow and awkward but, in theory, perfectly unbreakable cipher used for the most important messages. Waterhouse knows this because he is one of the only two persons in Pearl Harbor who has clearance to decrypt it. The other one is Commander Schoen, and he is under sedation today. The duty officer opens up the appropriate safe and gives him the one-time pad for the day, which is basically a piece of graph paper covered with numbers printed in groups of five. The numbers have been chosen by secretaries in a basement in Washington by shuffling cards or drawing chits out of a hat. They are pure noise. One copy of the pure noise is in Waterhouse's hands, and the other copy is used by the person who encrypted this message in Washington.\n\nWaterhouse sits down and gets to work, subtracting noise from ciphertext to produce plaintext.\n\nThe first thing he sees is that this message's classification is not merely Top Secret, or even Ultra, but something entirely new: ULTRA MEGA.\n\nThe messages states that after thoroughly destroying this message, he--Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse--is to proceed to London, England, by the fastest available means. All ships, trains, and airplanes, even submarines, will be made available to him. Though a member of the U.S. Navy, he is even to be provided with an extra uniform--an Army uniform--in case it simplifies matters for him.\n\nThe one thing he must never, ever do is place himself in a situation where he could be captured by the enemy. In this sense, the war is suddenly over for Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1618665", "artist_names": "Carla Thomas", "full_title": "When Tomorrow Comes by\u00a0Carla\u00a0Thomas", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/d8f2ca71e4da17d3a7a0941ac4bb5c72.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d8f2ca71e4da17d3a7a0941ac4bb5c72.500x500x1.jpg", "id": 1618665, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429900247, "path": "/Carla-thomas-when-tomorrow-comes-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Carla-thomas-when-tomorrow-comes-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1967, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1967", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1967", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/d8f2ca71e4da17d3a7a0941ac4bb5c72.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d8f2ca71e4da17d3a7a0941ac4bb5c72.500x500x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "When Tomorrow Comes", "title_with_featured": "When Tomorrow Comes", "updated_by_human_at": 1531108090, "url": "https://genius.com/Carla-thomas-when-tomorrow-comes-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/348601", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0511fb4f83992fcade2a87b8c4c75db3.166x190x1.jpg", "id": 348601, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/76a0839b33a8a93d04d71bc071d9d10f.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "c", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Carla Thomas", "slug": "Carla-thomas", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Carla-thomas"}, "artist": "Carla Thomas", "lyrics": "When Tomorrow Comes LyricsIt's easy for a love to come and go\nOh, yes, it is\nFor you to be thrilled just one time\nThen want no more\n\nOh, darling, when tomorrow comes\nWill you still want the love I got\nOh, tell me, when tomorrow\nComes and find us\nWill my kisses still be hot\nNow will your love for me be\nThe kind of love that lasts\nWhen you reach out to hold me\nTomorrow, will you reach out that fast\n\nOh, I want to know\nWhen tomorrow comes\nWill the need still be there\nOh, my lover\nWhen tomorrow comes and find us\nTell me will you, will you still care\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is\nI don't want just a one day lover\nToday with me, tomorrow with another\nWhat I want is an everyday man\nTo prove that loving over and\nOver again, oh, yeah, uh huh\n\nDarling, when tomorrow comes\nWill the need still be there\nWhen tomorrow comes and finds us\nTell me, will, will you still care\n\nI wanna know when tomorrow comes\nI wanna know will, will you still need me\nWhen tomorrow comes\nWill your kisses be the way\nThey're supposed to be\nYou might also likeI wanna know, know, know.....Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/6998156", "artist_names": "Genius", "full_title": "April 2022 Singles Release Calendar by\u00a0Genius", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.999x999x1.png", "id": 6998156, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 8723889, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1659262627, "path": "/Genius-april-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Genius-april-2022-singles-release-calendar-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2022, "month": 4, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "April 2022", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Apr. 2022", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.999x999x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 31610}, "title": "April 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "title_with_featured": "April 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "updated_by_human_at": 1659262627, "url": "https://genius.com/Genius-april-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/204611", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/822a5f872a1fcfe377695dc0046c6bc6.900x176x1.jpg", "id": 204611, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0ca83e3130e1303a7f78ba351e3091cd.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Genius", "slug": "Genius", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Genius", "iq": 77869}, "artist": "Genius", "lyrics": "April 2022 Singles Release Calendar Lyrics**ATTENTION: Please DO NOT edit this page on the NEW song page**4/1\n5 Seconds of Summer -

Avianne and y'all get a lease in that bitch\nMy earlobes got them yellow boogers like I sneezed in that bitch (Achoo)\nYour 808s is dry, you need to put some grease in that bitch\nAnd let it sit, nigga, fuck what you heard (Fuck what you heard)\nAnd fuck rap, I make a living off that four-letter word (GOLF WANG)\nOne-stop shop, nigga, just to sell them shoes\nThe profit margins lookin' higher

LyricsDuring nineteen fifty-nine, when the public was becoming aware of the Muslims after the New York telecast \"The Hate That Hate Produced,\" I was in San Francisco, about to retire after twenty years in the U.S. Coast Guard. A friend returned from a visit to her Detroit home and told me of a startling \"black man's\" religion, \"The Nation of Islam,\" to which, to her surprise, her entire family was converted. I listened with incredulity to how a \"mad scientist Mr. Yacub\" had genetically \"grafted\" the white race from an original black people. The organization's leader was described as \"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad\" and a \"Minister Malcolm X\" was apparently chief of staff.\n\nWhen I entered a civilian writing career in New York City, I collected, around Harlem, a good deal of provocative material and then proposed an article about the cult to the Reader's Digest. Visiting the Muslim restaurant in Harlem, I asked how I could meet Minister Malcolm X, who was pointed out talking in a telephone booth right behind me. Soon he came out, a gangling, tall, reddish-brown-skinned fellow, at that time thirty-five years old; when my purpose was made known, he bristled, his eyes skewering me from behind the horn-rimmed glasses. \"You're another one of the white man's tools sent to spy!\" he accused me sharply. I said I had a legitimate writing assignment and showed him my letter from the magazine stating that an objective article was wanted, one that would balance what the Muslims said of themselves and what their attackers said about them. Malcolm X snorted that no white man's promise was worth the paper it was on; he would need time to decide if he would cooperate or not. Meanwhile, he suggested that I could attend some of the Harlem Temple Number 7 meetings (\"temples\" have since been renamed \"mosques\") which were open to non-Muslim Negroes.\n\nAround the Muslim's restaurant, I met some of the converts, all of them neatly dressed and almost embarrassingly polite. Their manners and miens reflected the Spartan personal discipline the organization demanded, and none of them would utter anything but Nation of Islam clich\u00e9s. Even excellent weather was viewed as a blessing from Allah, with corollary credit due to \"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.\"\n\nFinally, Minister Malcolm X told me that he would not take personal responsibility. He said that I should talk about an article with Mr. Muhammad personally. I expressed willingness, an appointment was made, and I flew to Chicago. The slightly built, shy-acting, soft-voiced Mr. Muhammad invited me to dinner with his immediate family in his mansion. I was aware that I was being carefully sized up while he talked primarily of F.B.I. and Internal Revenue Service close surveillance of his organization, and of a rumored forthcoming Congressional probe. \"But I have no fear of any of them; I have all that I need -- the truth,\" Mr. Muhammad said. The subject of my writing an article somehow never got raised, but Malcolm X proved far more cooperative when I returned.\n\nHe would sit with me at a white-topped table in the Muslim restaurant and answer guardedly any questions I asked between constant interruptions by calls from the New York press in the telephone booth. When I asked if I could see Muslim activities in some other cities, he arranged with other ministers for me to attend meetings at temples in Detroit, Washington, and Philadelphia.\n\nMy article entitled \"Mr. Muhammad Speaks\" appeared in early 1960, and it was the first featured magazine notice of the phenomenon. A letter quickly came from Mr. Muhammad appreciating that the article kept my promise to be objective, and Malcolm X telephoned similar compliments. About this time, Dr. C. Eric Lincoln's book The Black Muslims in America was published and the Black Muslims became a subject of growing interest. During 1961 and 1962, the Saturday Evening Post teamed me with a white writer, Al Balk, to do an article; next I did a personal interview of Malcolm X for Playboy magazine, which had promised to print verbatim whatever response he made to my questions. During that interview of several days' duration, Malcolm X repeatedly exclaimed, after particularly blistering anti-Christian or anti-white statements: \"You know that devil's not going to print that!\" He was very much taken aback when Playboy kept its word.\nMalcolm X began to warm up to me somewhat. He was most aware of the national periodicals' power, and he had come to regard me, if still suspiciously, as one avenue of access. Occasionally now he began to telephone me advising me of some radio, television, or personal speaking appearance he was about to make, or he would invite me to attend some Black Muslim bazaar or other public affair.\n\nI was in this stage of relationship with the Malcolm X who often described himself on the air as \"the angriest black man in America\" when in early 1963 my agent brought me together with a publisher whom the Playboy interview had given the idea of the autobiography of Malcolm X. I was asked if I felt I could get the now nationally known firebrand to consent to telling the intimate details of his entire life. I said I didn't know, but I would ask him. The editor asked me if I could sketch the likely highlights of such a book, and as I commenced talking, I realized how little I knew about the man personally, despite all my interviews. I said that the question had made me aware of how careful Malcolm X had always been to play himself down and to play up his leader Elijah Muhammad.\n\nAll that I knew, really, I said, was that I had heard Malcolm X refer in passing to his life of crime and prison before he became a Black Muslim; that several times he had told me: \"You wouldn't believe my past,\" and that I had heard others say that at one time he had peddled dope and women and committed armed robberies.\n\nI knew that Malcolm X had an almost fanatical obsession about time. \"I have less patience with someone who doesn't wear a watch than with anyone else, for this type is not time-conscious,\" he had once told me. \"In all our deeds, the proper value and respect for time determines success or failure.\" I knew how the Black Muslim membership was said to increase wherever Malcolm X lectured, and I knew his pride that Negro prisoners in most prisons were discovering the Muslim religion as he had when he was a convict. I knew he professed to eat only what a Black Muslim (preferably his wife Betty) had cooked and he drank innumerable cups of coffee which he lightened with cream, commenting wryly, \"Coffee is the only thing I like integrated.\" Over our luncheon table, I told the editor and my agent how Malcolm X could unsettle non-Muslims -- as, for instance, once when he offered to drive me to a subway, I began to light a cigarette and he drily observed, \"That would make you the first person ever to smoke in this automobile.\"\n\nMalcolm X gave me a startled look when I asked him if he would tell his life story for publication. It was one of the few times I have ever seen him uncertain. \"I will have to give a book a lot of thought,\" he finally said. Two days later, he telephoned me to meet him again at the Black Muslim restaurant. He said, \"I'll agree. I think my life story may help people to appreciate better how Mr. Muhammad salvages black people. But I don't want my motives for this misinterpreted by anybody -- the Nation of Islam must get every penny that might come to me.\" Of course, Mr. Muhammad's agreement would be necessary, and I would have to ask Mr. Muhammad myself.\n\nSo I flew again to see Mr. Muhammad, but this time to Phoenix, Arizona, where the Nation of Islam had bought him the house in the hot, dry climate that relieved his severe bronchial condition. He and I talked alone this time. He told me how his organization had come far with largely uneducated Muslims and that truly giant strides for the black man could be made if his organization were aided by some of the talents which were available in the black race. He said, \"And one of our worst needs is writers\" -- but he did not press me to answer. He suddenly began coughing, and rapidly grew worse and worse until I rose from my seat and went to him, alarmed, but he waved me away, gasping that he would be all right. Between gasps, he told me he felt that \"Allah approves\" the book. He said, \"Malcolm is one of my most outstanding ministers.\" After arranging for his chauffeur to return me to the Phoenix airport, Mr. Muhammad quickly bade me good-bye and rushed from the room coughing.\n\nBack East, Malcolm X carefully read and then signed the publication contract, and he withdrew from his wallet a piece of paper filled with his sprawling longhand. \"This is this book's dedication,\" he said. I read: \"This book I dedicate to The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, who found me here in America in the muck and mire of the filthiest civilization and society on this earth, and pulled me out, cleaned me up, and stood me on my feet, and made me the man that I am today.\"\n\nThe contract provided that all monies accruing to Malcolm X \"shall be made payable by the agent to `Muhammad's Mosque No. 2,'\" but Malcolm X felt this was insufficient. He dictated to me a letter to type for his signature, which I did: \"Any and all monies representing my contracted share of the financial returns should be made payable by the literary agent to Muhammad's Mosque No. 2. These payments should be mailed to the following address: Mr. Raymond Sharrieff, 4847 Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago 15, Illinois.\"\n\nAnother letter was dictated, this one an agreement between him and me: \"Nothing can be in this book's manuscript that I didn't say, and nothing can be left out that I want in it.\"\n\nIn turn, I asked Malcolm X to sign for me a personal pledge that however busy he was, he would give me a priority quota of his time for the planned 100,000-word \"as told to\" book which would detail his entire life. And months later, in a time of strain between us, I asked for -- and he gave -- his permission that at the end of the book I could write comments of my own about him which would not be subject to his review.\n\nMalcolm X promptly did begin to pay me two- and three-hour visits, parking his blue Oldsmobile outside the working studio I then had in Greenwich Village. He always arrived around nine or ten at night carrying his flat tan leather briefcase which along with his scholarly look gave him a resemblance to a hardworking lawyer. Inevitably, he was tired after his long busy day, and sometimes he was clearly exhausted.\n\nWe got off to a very poor start. To use a word he liked, I think both of us were a bit \"spooky.\" Sitting right there and staring at me was the fiery Malcolm X who could be as acid toward Negroes who angered him as he was against whites in general. On television, in press conferences, and at Muslim rallies, I had heard him bitterly attack other Negro writers as \"Uncle Toms,\" \"yard Negroes,\" \"black men in white clothes.\" And there I sat staring at him, proposing to spend a year plumbing his innermost secrets when he had developed a near phobia for secrecy during his years of crime and his years in the Muslim hierarchy. My twenty years in military service and my Christian religious persuasion didn't help, either; he often jeered publicly at these affiliations for Negroes. And although he now would indirectly urge me to write for national magazines about the Muslims, he had told me several times, in various ways, that \"you blacks with professional abilities of any kind will one of these days wake up and find out that you must unite under the leadership of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad for your own salvation.\" Malcolm X was also convinced that the F.B.I. had \"bugged\" my studio; he probably suspected that it may even have been done with my cooperation. For the first several weeks, he never entered the room where we worked without exclaiming, \"Testing, testing -- one, two, three. . . . \"\n\nTense incidents occurred. One night a white friend was in the studio when Malcolm X arrived a little earlier than anticipated, and they passed each other in the corridor. Malcolm X's manner during all of that session suggested that his worst doubts had been confirmed. Another time when Malcolm X sat haranguing me about the glories of the Muslim organization, he was gesturing with his passport in his hand; he saw that I was trying to read its perforated number and suddenly he thrust the passport toward me, his neck flushed reddish: \"Get the number straight, but it won't be anything the white devil doesn't already know. He issued me the passport.\"\nFor perhaps a month I was afraid we weren't going to get any book. Malcolm X was still stiffly addressing me as \"Sir!\" and my notebook contained almost nothing but Black Muslim philosophy, praise of Mr. Muhammad, and the \"evils\" of \"the white devil.\" He would bristle when I tried to urge him that the proposed book was his life. I was thinking that I might have to advise the publisher that I simply couldn't seem to get through to my subject when the first note of hope occurred. I had noticed that while Malcolm X was talking, he often simultaneously scribbled with his red-ink ball-point pen on any handy paper. Sometimes it was the margin of a newspaper he brought in, sometimes it was on index cards that he carried in the back of a small, redbacked appointment book. I began leaving two white paper napkins by him every time I served him more coffee, and the ruse worked when he sometimes scribbled on the napkins, which I retrieved when he left. Some examples are these:\n\n\"Here lies a YM, killed by a BM, fighting for the WM, who killed all the RM.\" (Decoding that wasn't difficult knowing Malcolm X. \"YM\" was for yellow man, \"BM\" for black man, \"WM\" for white man, and \"RM\" was for red man.)\n\n\"Nothing ever happened without cause. Cause BM condition WM won't face. WM obsessed with hiding his guilt.\"\n\n\"If Christianity had asserted itself in Germany, six million Jews would have lived.\"\n\n\"WM so quick to tell BM `Look what I have done for you!' No! Look what you have done to us!\"\n\n\"BM dealing with WM who put our eyes out, now he condemns us because we cannot see.\"\n\n\"Only persons really changed history those who changed men's thinking about themselves. Hitler as well as Jesus, Stalin as well as Buddha . . . Hon. Elijah Muhammad. . . .\"\n\nIt was through a clue from one of the scribblings that finally I cast a bait that Malcolm X took. \"Woman who cries all the time is only because she knows she can get away with it,\" he had scribbled. I somehow raised the subject of women. Suddenly, between sips of coffee and further scribbling and doodling, he vented his criticisms and skepticisms of women. \"You never can fully trust any woman,\" he said. \"I've got the only one I ever met whom I would trust seventy-five percent. I've told her that.\" he said. \"I've told her like I tell you I've seen too many men destroyed by their wives, or their women.\n\n\"I don't completely trust anyone,\" he went on, \"not even myself. I have seen too many men destroy themselves. Other people I trust from not at all to highly, like The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.\" Malcolm X looked squarely at me. \"You I trust about twenty-five percent.\"\n\nTrying to keep Malcolm X talking, I mined the woman theme for all it was worth. Triumphantly, he exclaimed, \"Do you know why Benedict Arnold turned traitor -- a woman!\" He said, \"Whatever else a woman is, I don't care who the woman is, it starts with her being vain. I'll prove it, something you can do anytime you want, and I know what I'm talking about, I've done it. You think of the hardest-looking, meanest-acting woman you know, one of those women who never smiles. Well, every day you see that woman you look her right in the eyes and tell her `I think you're beautiful,' and you watch what happens. The first day she may curse you out, the second day, too -- but you watch, you keep on, after a while one day she's going to start smiling just as soon as you come in sight.\"\n\nWhen Malcolm X left that night, I retrieved napkin scribblings that further documented how he could be talking about one thing and thinking of something else:\n\n\"Negroes have too much righteousness. WM says, `I want this piece of land, how do I get those couple of thousand BM on it off?'\"\n\n\"I have wife who understands, or even if she doesn't she at least pretends.\"\n\"BM struggle never gets open support from abroad it needs unless BM first forms own united front.\"\n\n\"Sit down, talk with people with brains I respect, all of us want same thing, do some brainstorming.\"\n\n\"Would be shocking to reveal names of the BM leaders who have secretly met with THEM.\" (The capitalized letters stood for The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.)\n\nThen one night, Malcolm X arrived nearly out on his feet from fatigue. For two hours, he paced the floor delivering a tirade against Negro leaders who were attacking Elijah Muhammad and himself. I don't know what gave me the inspiration to say once when he paused for breath, \"I wonder if you'd tell me something about your mother?\"\n\nAbruptly he quit pacing, and the look he shot at me made me sense that somehow the chance question had hit him. When I look back at it now, I believe I must have caught him so physically weak that his defenses were vulnerable.\n\nSlowly, Malcolm X began to talk, now walking in a tight circle. \"She was always standing over the stove, trying to stretch whatever we had to eat. We stayed so hungry that we were dizzy. I remember the color of dresses she used to wear -- they were a kind of faded-out gray. . . .\" And he kept on talking until dawn, so tired that the big feet would often almost stumble in their pacing. From this stream-of-consciousness reminiscing I finally got out of him the foundation for this book's beginning chapters, \"Nightmare\" and \"Mascot.\" After that night, he never again hesitated to tell me even the most intimate details of his personal life, over the next two years. His talking about his mother triggered something.\n\nMalcolm X's mood ranged from somber to grim as he recalled his childhood. I remember his making a great point of how he learned what had been a cardinal awareness of his ever since: \"It's the hinge that squeaks that gets the grease.\" When his narration reached his moving to Boston to live with his half-sister Ella, Malcolm X began to laugh about how \"square\" he had been in the ghetto streets. \"Why, I'm telling you things I haven't thought about since then!\" he would exclaim. Then it was during recalling the early Harlem days that Malcolm X really got carried away. One night, suddenly, wildly, he jumped up from his chair and, incredibly, the fearsome black demagogue was scat-singing and popping his fingers, \"re-bop-de-bop-blap-blam -- \" and then grabbing a vertical pipe with one hand (as the girl partner) he went jubilantly lindy-hopping around, his coattail and the long legs and the big feet flying as they had in those Harlem days. And then almost as suddenly, Malcolm X caught himself and sat back down, and for the rest of that session he was decidedly grumpy. Later on in the Harlem narrative, he grew somber again. \"The only thing I considered wrong was what I got caught doing wrong. I had a jungle mind, I was living in a jungle, and everything I did was done by instinct to survive.\" But he stressed that he had no regrets about his crimes, \"because it was all a result of what happens to thousands upon thousands of black men in the white man's Christian world.\"\n\nHis enjoyment resumed when the narrative entered his prison days. \"Let me tell you how I'd get those white devil convicts and the guards, too, to do anything I wanted. I'd whisper to them, `If you don't, I'll start a rumor that you're really a light Negro just passing as white.' That shows you what the white devil thinks about the black man. He'd rather die than be thought a Negro!\" He told me about the reading he had been able to do in prison: \"I didn't know what I was doing, but just by instinct I liked the books with intellectual vitamins.\" And another time: \"In the hectic pace of the world today, there is no time for meditation, or for deep thought. A prisoner has time that he can put to good use. I'd put prison second to college as the best place for a man to go if he needs to do some thinking. If he's motivated, in prison he can change his life.\"\n\nYet another time, Malcolm X reflected, \"Once a man has been to prison, he never looks at himself or at other people the same again. The `squares' out here whose boat has been in smooth waters all the time turn up their noses at an ex-con. But an ex-con can keep his head up when the `squares' sink.\"\n\nHe scribbled that night (I kept both my notebooks and the paper napkins dated): \"This WM created and dropped A-bomb on non-whites; WM now calls `Red' and lives in fear of other WM he knows may bomb us.\"\n\nAlso: \"Learn wisdom from the pupil of the eye that looks upon all things and yet to self is blind. Persian poet.\"\n\nAt intervals, Malcolm X would make a great point of stressing to me, \"Now, I don't want anything in this book to make it sound that I think I'm somebody important.\" I would assure him that I would try not to, and that in any event he would be checking the manuscript page by page, and ultimately the galley proofs. At other times, he would end an attack upon the white man and, watching me take the notes, exclaim. \"That devil's not going to print that, I don't care what he says!\" I would point out that the publishers had made a binding contract and had paid a sizable sum in advance. Malcolm X would say, \"You trust them, and I don't. You studied what he wanted you to learn about him in schools, I studied him in the streets and in prison, where you see the truth.\"\n\nExperiences which Malcolm X had had during a day could flavor his interview mood. The most wistful, tender anecdotes generally were told on days when some incident had touched him. Once, for instance, he told me that he had learned that a Harlem couple, not Black Muslims, had named their newborn son \"Malcolm\" after him. \"What do you know about that?\" he kept exclaiming. And that was the night he went back to his own boyhood again and this time recalled how he used to lie on his back on Hector's Hill and think. That night, too: \"I'll never forget the day they elected me the class president. A girl named Audrey Slaugh, whose father owned a car repair shop, nominated me. And a boy named James Cotton seconded the nomination. The teacher asked me to leave the room while the class voted. When I returned I was the class president. I couldn't believe it.\"\n\nAny interesting book which Malcolm X had read could get him going about his love of books. \"People don't realize how a man's whole life can be changed by one book.\" He came back again and again to the books that he had studied when in prison. \"Did you ever read The Loom of Language?\" he asked me and I said I hadn't. \"You should. Philology, it's a tough science -- all about how words can be recognized, no matter where you find them. Now, you take `Caesar,' it's Latin, in Latin it's pronounced like `Kaiser,' with a hard C. But we anglicize it by pronouncing a soft C. The Russians say `Czar' and mean the same thing. Another Russian dialect says `Tsar.' Jakob Grimm was one of the foremost philologists, I studied his `Grimm's Law' in prison -- all about consonants. Philology is related to the science of etymology, dealing in root words. I dabbled in both of them.\"\n\nWhen I turn that page in my notebook, the next bears a note that Malcolm X had telephoned me saying \"I'm going to be out of town for a few days.\" I assumed that as had frequently been the case before, he had speaking engagements or other Muslim business to attend somewhere and I was glad for the respite in which to get my notes separated under the chapter headings they would fit. But when Malcolm X returned this time, he reported triumphantly, \"I have something to tell you that will surprise you. Ever since we discussed my mother, I've been thinking about her. I realized that I had blocked her out of my mind -- it was just unpleasant to think about her having been twenty-some years in that mental hospital.\" He said, \"I don't want to take the credit. It was really my sister Yvonne who thought it might be possible to get her out. Yvonne got my brothers Wilfred, Wesley and Philbert together, and I went out there, too. It was Philbert who really handled it.\n\n\"It made me face something about myself,\" Malcolm X said. \"My mind had closed about our mother. I simply didn't feel the problem could be solved, so I had shut it out. I had built up subconscious defenses. The white man does this. He shuts out of his mind, and he builds up subconscious defenses against anything he doesn't want to face up to. I've just become aware how closed my mind was now that I've opened it up again. That's one of the characteristics I don't like about myself. If I meet a problem I feel I can't solve, I shut it out. I make believe that it doesn't exist. But it exists.\"\n\nIt was my turn to be deeply touched. Not long afterward, he was again away for a few days. When he returned this time, he said that at his brother Philbert's home, \"we had dinner with our mother for the first time in all those years!\" He said, \"She's sixty-six, and her memory is better than mine and she looks young and healthy. She has more of her teeth than those who were instrumental in sending her to the institution.\"\n\nWhen something had angered Malcolm X during the day, his face would be flushed redder when he visited me, and he generally would spend much of the session lashing out bitterly. When some Muslims were shot by Los Angeles policemen, one of them being killed, Malcolm X, upon his return from a trip he made there, was fairly apoplectic for a week. It had been in this mood that he had made, in Los Angeles, the statement which caused him to be heavily censured by members of both races.\n\n\"I've just heard some good news!\" -- referring to a plane crash at Orly Field in Paris in which thirty-odd white Americans, mostly from Atlanta, Georgia, had been killed instantly. (Malcolm X never publicly recanted this statement, to my knowledge, but much later he said to me simply, \"That's one of the things I wish I had never said.\")\n\nAnytime the name of the present Federal Judge Thurgood Marshall was raised, Malcolm X still practically spat fire in memory of what the judge had said years before when he was the N.A.A.C.P. chief attorney: \"The Muslims are run by a bunch of thugs organized from prisons and jails and financed, I am sure, by some Arab group.\" The only time that I have ever heard Malcolm X use what might be construed as a curse word, it was a \"hell\" used in response to a statement that Dr. Martin Luther King made that Malcolm X's talk brought \"misery upon Negroes.\" Malcolm X exploded to me, \"How in the hell can my talk do this? It's always a Negro responsible, not what the white man does!\" The \"extremist\" or \"demagogue\" accusation invariably would burn Malcolm X. \"Yes, I'm an extremist. The black race here in North America is in extremely bad condition. You show me a black man who isn't an extremist and I'll show you one who needs psychiatric attention!\"\n\nOnce when he said, \"Aristotle shocked people. Charles Darwin outraged people. Aldous Huxley scandalized millions!\" Malcolm X immediately followed the statement with \"Don't print that, people would think I'm trying to link myself with them.\" Another time, when something provoked him to exclaim, \"These Uncle Toms make me think about how the Prophet Jesus was criticized in his own country!\" Malcolm X promptly got up and silently took my notebook, tore out that page and crumpled it and put it into his pocket, and he was considerably subdued during the remainder of that session.\n\nI remember one time we talked and he showed me a newspaper clipping reporting where a Negro baby had been bitten by a rat. Malcolm X said, \"Now, just read that, just think of that a minute! Suppose it was your child! Where's that slumlord -- on some beach in Miami!\" He continued fuming throughout our interview. I did not go with him when later that day he addressed a Negro audience in Harlem and an incident occurred which Helen Dudar reported in the New York Post.\n\n\"Malcolm speaking in Harlem stared down at one of the white reporters present, the only whites admitted to the meeting, and went on, `Now, there's a reporter who hasn't taken a note in half an hour, but as soon as I start talking about the Jews, he's busy taking notes to prove that I'm anti-Semitic.'\n\nBehind the reporter, a male voice spoke up, `Kill the bastard, kill them all.' The young man, in his unease, smiled nervously and Malcolm jeered, `Look at him laugh. He's really not laughing, he's just laughing with his teeth.' An ugly tension curled the edges of the atmosphere. Then Malcolm went on: `The white man doesn't know how to laugh. He just shows his teeth. But we know how to laugh. We laugh deep down, from the bottom up.' The audience laughed, deep down, from the bottom up and, as suddenly as Malcolm had stirred it, so, skillfully and swiftly, he deflected it. It had been at once a masterful and shabby performance.\"\n\nI later heard somewhere, or read, that Malcolm X telephoned an apology to the reporter. But this was the kind of evidence which caused many close observers of the Malcolm X phenomenon to declare in absolute seriousness that he was the only Negro in America who could either start a race riot -- or stop one. When I once quoted this to him, tacitly inviting his comment, he told me tartly, \"I don't know if I could start one. I don't know if I'd want to stop one.\" It was the kind of statement he relished making.\n\nOver the months, I had gradually come to establish something of a telephone acquaintance with Malcolm X's wife, whom I addressed as \"Sister Betty,\" as I had heard the Muslims do. I admired how she ran a home, with, then, three small daughters, and still managed to take all of the calls which came for Malcolm X, surely as many calls as would provide a job for an average switchboard operator. Sometimes when he was with me, he would telephone home and spend as much as five minutes rapidly jotting on a pad the various messages which had been left for him.\n\nSister Betty, generally friendly enough on the phone with me, sometimes would exclaim in spontaneous indignation, \"The man never gets any sleep!\" Malcolm X rarely put in less than an eighteen-hour workday. Often when he had left my studio at four A.M. and a forty-minute drive lay between him and home in East Elmhurst, Long Island, he had asked me to telephone him there at nine A.M. Usually this would be when he wanted me to accompany him somewhere, and he was going to tell me, after reviewing his commitments, when and where he wanted me to meet him. (There were times when I didn't get an awful lot of sleep, myself.) He was always accompanied, either by some of his Muslim colleagues like James 67X (the 67th man named \"James\" who had joined Harlem's Mosque Number 7), or Charles 37X, or by me, but he never asked me to be with him when they were. I went with him to college and university lectures, to radio and television stations for his broadcasts, and to public appearances in a variety of situations and locations.\n\nIf we were driving somewhere, motorists along the highway would wave to Malcolm X, the faces of both whites and Negroes spontaneously aglow with the wonderment that I had seen evoked by other \"celebrities.\" No few airline hostesses had come to know him, because he flew so much; they smiled prettily at him, he was in turn the essence of courtly gentlemanliness, and inevitably the word spread and soon an unusual flow of bathroom traffic would develop, passing where he sat. Whenever we arrived at our destination, it became familiar to hear \"There's Malcolm X!\" \"Where?\" \"The tall one.\" Passers-by of both races stared at him. A few of both races, more Negroes than whites, would speak or nod to him in greeting. A high percentage of white people were visibly uncomfortable in his presence, especially within the confines of small areas, such as in elevators. \"I'm the only black man they've ever been close to who they know speaks the truth to them,\" Malcolm X once explained to me. \"It's their guilt that upsets them, not me.\" He said another time, \"The white man is afraid of truth. The truth takes the white man's breath and drains his strength -- you just watch his face get red anytime you tell him a little truth.\"\n\nThere was something about this man when he was in a room with people. He commanded the room, whoever else was present. Even out of doors; once I remember in Harlem he sat on a speaker's stand between Congressman Adam Clayton Powell and the former Manhattan Borough President Hulan Jack, and when the street rally was over the crowd focus was chiefly on Malcolm X. I remember another time that we had gone by railway from New York City to Philadelphia where he appeared in the Philadelphia Convention Hall on the radio station WCAU program of Ed Harvey. \"You are the man who has said `All Negroes are angry and I am the angriest of all'; is that correct?\" asked Harvey, on the air, introducing Malcolm X, and as Malcolm X said crisply, \"That quote is correct!\" the gathering crowd of bystanders stared at him, riveted.\n\nWe had ridden to Philadelphia in reserved parlor car seats. \"I can't get caught on a coach, I could get into trouble on a coach,\" Malcolm X had said. Walking to board the parlor car, we had passed a dining car toward which he jerked his head, \"I used to work on that thing.\" Riding to our destination, he conversationally told me that the F.B.I. had tried to bribe him for information about Elijah Muhammad; that he wanted me to be sure and read a new book, Crisis in Black and White by Charles Silberman -- \"one of the very few white writers I know with the courage to tell his kind the truth\"; and he asked me to make a note to please telephone the New York Post's feature writer Helen Dudar and tell her he thought very highly of her recent series -- he did not want to commend her directly.\n\nAfter the Ed Harvey Show was concluded, we took the train to return to New York City. The parlor car, packed with businessmen behind their newspapers, commuting homeward after their workdays, was electric with Malcolm X's presence. After the white-jacketed Negro porter had made several trips up and down the aisle, he was in the middle of another trip when Malcolm X sotto-voced in my ear, \"He used to work with me, I forget his name, we worked right on this very train together. He knows it's me. He's trying to make up his mind what to do.\" The porter went on past us, poker-faced. But when he came through again, Malcolm X suddenly leaned forward from his seat, smiling at the porter. \"Why, sure, I know who you are!\" the porter suddenly said, loudly. \"You washed dishes right on this train! I was just telling some of the fellows you were in my car here. We all follow you!\"\n\nThe tension on the car could have been cut with a knife. Then, soon, the porter returned to Malcolm X, his voice expansive. \"One of our guests would like to meet you.\" Now a young, cleancut white man rose and came up, his hand extended, and Malcolm X rose and shook the proffered hand firmly. Newspapers dropped just below eye-level the length of the car. The young white man explained distinctly, loudly, that he had been in the Orient for a while, and now was studying at Columbia. \"I don't agree with everything you say,\" he told Malcolm X, \"but I have to admire your presentation.\"\n\nMalcolm's voice in reply was cordiality itself. \"I don't think you could search America, sir, and find two men who agree on everything.\" Subsequently, to another white man, an older businessman, who came up and shook hands, he said evenly, \"Sir, I know how you feel. It's a hard thing to speak out against me when you are agreeing with so much that I say.\" And we rode on into New York under, now, a general open gazing.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Malcolm X slashed at the government's reluctance to take positive steps in the Negro's behalf. I gather that even the White House took notice, for not long afterward I left off interviewing Malcolm X for a few days and went to the White House to do a Playboy interview of the then White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger, who grimaced spontaneously when I said I was writing the life story of Malcolm X. Another time I left Malcolm X to interview the U.S. Nazi Party Commander George Lincoln Rockwell, who frankly stated that he admired the courage of Malcolm X, and he felt that the two of them should speak together across the United States, and they could thus begin a real solution to the race problem -- one of voluntary separation of the white and black races, with Negroes returning to Africa. I reported this to Malcolm X, who snorted, \"He must think I'm nuts! What am I going to look like going speaking with a devil!\" Yet another time, I went off to Atlanta and interviewed for Playboy Dr. Martin Luther King. He was privately intrigued to hear little-known things about Malcolm X that I told him; for publication, he discussed him with reserve, and he did say that he would sometime like to have an opportunity to talk with him. Hearing this, Malcolm X said drily, \"You think I ought to send him a telegram with my telephone number?\" (But from other things that Malcolm X said to me at various times, I deduced that he actually had a reluctant admiration for Dr. King.)\n\nMalcolm X and I reached the point, ultimately, where we shared a mutual camaraderie that, although it was never verbally expressed, was a warm one. He was for me unquestionably one of the most engaging personalities I had ever met, and for his part, I gathered, I was someone he had learned he could express himself to, with candor, without the likelihood of hearing it repeated, and like any person who lived amid tension, he enjoyed being around someone, another man, with whom he could psychically relax. When I made trips now, he always asked me to telephone him when I would be returning to New York, and generally, if he could squeeze it into his schedule, he met me at the airport. I would see him coming along with his long, gangling strides, and wearing the wide, toothy, good-natured grin, and as he drove me into New York City he would bring me up to date on things of interest that had happened since I left. I remember one incident within the airport that showed me how Malcolm X never lost his racial perspective. Waiting for my baggage, we witnessed a touching family reunion scene as part of which several cherubic little children romped and played, exclaiming in another language. \"By tomorrow night, they'll know how to say their first English word -- nigger,\" observed Malcolm X.\n\nWhen Malcolm X made long trips, such as to San Francisco or Los Angeles, I did not go along, but frequently, usually very late at night, he would telephone me, and ask how the book was coming along, and he might set up the time for our next interview upon his return. One call that I never will forget came at close to four A.M., waking me; he must have just gotten up in Los Angeles. His voice said, \"Alex Haley?\" I said, sleepily, \"Yes? Oh, hey, Malcolm!\" His voice said, \"I trust you seventy percent\" -- and then he hung up. I lay a short time thinking about him and I went back to sleep feeling warmed by that call, as I still am warmed to remember it. Neither of us ever mentioned it.\n\nMalcolm X's growing respect for individual whites seemed to be reserved for those who ignored on a personal basis the things he said about whites and who jousted with him as a man. He, moreover, was convinced that he could tell a lot about any person by listening. \"There's an art to listening well,\" he told me. \"I listen closely to the sound of a man's voice when he's speaking. I can hear sincerity.\" The newspaper person whom he ultimately came to admire probably more than any other was the New York Times' M. S. Handler. (I was very happy when I learned that Handler had agreed to write this book's Introduction; I know that Malcolm X would have liked that.) The first time I ever heard Malcolm X speak of Handler, whom he had recently met, he began, \"I was talking with this devil --\" and abruptly he cut himself off in obvious embarrassment. \"It's a reporter named Handler, from the Times --\" he resumed. Malcolm X's respect for the man steadily increased, and Handler, for his part, was an influence upon the inner Malcolm X. \"He's the most genuinely unprejudiced white man I ever met,\" Malcolm X said to me, speaking of Handler months later. \"I have asked him things and tested him. I have listened to him talk, closely.\"\n\nI saw Malcolm X too many times exhilarated in after-lecture give-and-take with predominantly white student bodies at colleges and universities to ever believe that he nurtured at his core any blanket white-hatred. \"The young whites, and blacks, too, are the only hope that America has,\" he said to me once. \"The rest of us have always been living in a lie.\"\n\nSeveral Negroes come to mind now who I know, in one way or another, had vastly impressed Malcolm X. (Some others come to mind whom I know he has vastly abhorred, but these I will not mention.) Particularly high in his esteem, I know, was the great photographer, usually associated with Life magazine, Gordon Parks. It was Malcolm X's direct influence with Elijah Muhammad which got Parks permitted to enter and photograph for publication in Life the highly secret self-defense training program of the Black Muslim Fruit of Islam, making Parks, as\nfar as I know, the only non-Muslim who ever has witnessed this, except for policemen and other agency representatives who had feigned \"joining\" the Black Muslims to infiltrate them. \"His success among the white man never has made him lose touch with black reality,\" Malcolm X said of Parks once.\n\nAnother person toward whom Malcolm X felt similarly was the actor Ossie Davis. Once in the middle of one of our interviews, when we had been talking about something else, Malcolm X suddenly asked me, \"Do you know Ossie Davis?\" I said I didn't. He said, \"I ought to introduce you sometime, that's one of the finest black men.\" In Malcolm X's long dealings with the staff of the Harlem weekly newspaper Amsterdam News, he had come to admire Executive Editor James Hicks and the star feature writer James Booker. He said that Hicks had \"an open mind, and he never panics for the white man.\" He thought that Booker was an outstanding reporter; he also was highly impressed with Mrs. Booker when he met her.\n\nIt was he who introduced me to two of my friends today, Dr. C. Eric Lincoln who was at the time writing the book The Black Muslims in America, and Louis Lomax who was then writing various articles about the Muslims. Malcolm X deeply respected the care and depth which Dr. Lincoln was putting into his research. Lomax, he admired for his ferreting ear and eye for hot news. \"If I see that rascal Lomax running somewhere, I'll grab my hat and get behind him,\" Malcolm X said once, \"because I know he's onto something.\" Author James Baldwin Malcolm X also admired. \"He's so brilliant he confuses the white man with words on paper.\" And another time, \"He's upset the white man more than anybody except The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.\"\n\nMalcolm X had very little good to say of Negro ministers, very possibly because most of them had attacked the Black Muslims. Excepting reluctant admiration of Dr. Martin Luther King, I heard him speak well of only one other, The Reverend Eugene L. Callender of Harlem's large Presbyterian Church of the Master. \"He's a preacher, but he's a fighter for the black man,\" said Malcolm X. I later learned that somewhere the direct, forthright Reverend Callender had privately cornered Malcolm X and had read him the riot act about his general attacks upon the Negro\nclergy. Malcolm X also admired The Reverend Adam Clayton Powell, in his Congressman political role: \"I'd think about retiring if the black man had ten like him in Washington.\" He had similar feelings about the N.A.A.C.P. lawyer, now a New York State Assemblyman, Percy Sutton, and later Sutton was retained as his personal attorney. Among Negro educators, of whom Malcolm X met many in his college and university lecturing, I never heard him speak well of any but one, Dr. Kenneth B. Clark. \"There's a black man with brains gone to bed,\" Malcolm X told me once, briefly lapsing into his old vernacular. He had very distinct reservations about Negro professional intelligentsia as a category. They were the source from which most of the Black Muslims' attackers came. It was for this reason that some of his most bristling counterattacks against \"these so-called educated Uncle Thomases, Ph.D.\" were flung out at his audiences at Negro institutions of higher learning.\n\nWhere I witnessed the Malcolm X who was happiest and most at ease among members of our own race was when sometimes I chanced to accompany him on what he liked to call \"my little daily rounds\" around the streets of Harlem, among the Negroes that he said the \"so-called black leaders\" spoke of \"as black masses statistics.\" On these tours, Malcolm X generally avoided the arterial 125th Street in Harlem; he plied the side streets, especially in those areas which were thickest with what he described as \"the black man down in the gutter where I came from,\" the poverty-ridden with a high incidence of dope addicts and winos.\n\nMalcolm X here indeed was a hero. Striding along the side-walks, he bathed all whom he met in the boyish grin, and his conversation with any who came up was quiet and pleasant. \"It's just what the white devil wants you to do, brother,\" he might tell a wino, \"he wants you to get drunk so he will have an excuse to put a club up beside your head.\" Or I remember once he halted at a stoop to greet several older women: \"Sisters, let me ask you something,\" he said conversationally, \"have you ever known one white man who either didn't do something to you, or take something from you?\" One among that audience exclaimed after a moment, \"I sure ain't!\" whereupon all of them\njoined in laughter and we walked on with Malcolm X waving back to cries of \"He's right!\"\n\nI remember that once in the early evening we rounded a corner to hear a man, shabbily dressed, haranguing a small crowd around his speaking platform of an upturned oblong wooden box with an American flag alongside. \"I don't respect or believe in this damn flag, it's there because I can't hold a public meeting without it unless I want the white man to put me in jail. And that's what I'm up here to talk about -- these crackers getting rich off the blood and bones of your and my people!\" Said Malcolm X, grinning, \"He's working!\"\n\nMalcolm X rarely exchanged any words with those Negro men with shiny, \"processed\" hair without giving them a nudge. Very genially: \"Ahhhh, brother, the white devil has taught you to hate yourself so much that you put hot lye in your hair to make it look more like his hair.\"\n\nI remember another stoopful of women alongside the door of a small grocery store where I had gone for something, leaving Malcolm X talking across the street. As I came out of the store, one woman was excitedly describing for the rest a Malcolm X lecture she had heard in Mosque Number 7 one Sunday. \"Oooooh, he burnt that white man, burnt him up, chile . . . chile, he told us we descendin' from black kings an' queens -- Lawd, I didn't know it!\" Another woman asked, \"You believe that?\" and the first vehemently responded, \"Yes, I do!\"\n\nAnd I remember a lone, almost ragged guitarist huddled on a side street playing and singing just for himself when he glanced up and instantly recognized the oncoming, striding figure. \"Huh-ho!\" the guitarist exclaimed, and jumping up, he snapped into a mock salute. \"My man!\"\n\nMalcolm X loved it. And they loved him. There was no question about it: whether he was standing tall beside a street lamp chatting with winos, or whether he was firing his radio and television broadsides to unseen millions of people, or whether he was titillating small audiences of sophisticated whites with his small-talk such as, \"My hobby is stirring up Negroes, that's spelled knee-grows the way you liberals pronounce it\" -- the man had charisma, and he had power. And I was not the only one who at various times marveled at how he could continue to receive such an awesome amount of international personal publicity and still season liberally practically everything he said, both in public and privately, with credit and hosannas to \"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.\" Often I made side notes to myself about this. I kept, in effect, a double-entry set of notebooks. Once, noting me switching from one to the other, Malcolm X curiously asked me what for? I told him some reason, but not that one notebook was things he said for his book and the other was for my various personal observations about him; very likely he would have become self-conscious. \"You must have written a million words by now,\" said Malcolm X. \"Probably,\" I said. \"This white man's crazy,\" he mused. \"I'll prove it to you. Do you think I'd publicize somebody knocking me like I do him?\"\n\n\"Look, tell me the truth,\" Malcolm X said to me one evening, \"you travel around. Have you heard anything?\"\n\nTruthfully, I told him I didn't know what he had reference to. He dropped it and talked of something else.\n\nFrom Malcolm X himself, I had seen, or heard, a few unusual things which had caused me some little private wonder and speculation, and then, with nothing to hang them on to, I had dismissed them. One day in his car, we had stopped for the red light at an intersection; another car with a white man driving had stopped alongside, and when this white man saw Malcolm X, he instantly called across to him, \"I don't blame your people for turning to you. If I were a Negro I'd follow you, too. Keep up the fight!\" Malcolm X said to the man very sincerely, \"I wish I could have a white chapter of the people I meet like you.\" The light changed, and as both cars drove on, Malcolm X quickly said to me, firmly, \"Not only don't write that, never repeat it. Mr. Muhammad would have a fit.\" The significant thing about the incident, I later reflected, was that it was the first time I had ever heard him speak of Elijah Muhammad with anything less than reverence.\n\nAbout the same time, one of the scribblings of Malcolm X's that I had retrieved had read, enigmatically, \"My life has always been one of changes.\" Another time, this was in September, 1963, Malcolm X had been highly upset about something during an entire session, and when I read the Amsterdam News for that week, I guessed that he had been upset about an item in Jimmy Booker's column that Booker had heard that Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X were feuding. (Booker was later to reveal that after his column was written, he had gone on vacation, and on his return he learned that Malcolm X \"stormed into the Amsterdam News with three followers . . . `I want to see Jimmy Booker. I don't like what he wrote. There is no fight between me and Elijah Muhammad. I believe in Mr. Muhammad and will lay down my life for him.'\")\n\nAlso, now and then, when I chanced to meet a few other key Muslims, mainly when I was with Malcolm X, but when he was not immediately present, I thought I detected either in subtle phrasing, or in manner, something less than total admiration of their famous colleague -- and then I would tell myself I had misinterpreted. And during these days, Dr. C. Eric Lincoln and I would talk on the phone fairly often. We rarely would fail to mention how it seemed almost certain that seeds of trouble lay in the fact that however much Malcolm X praised Elijah Muhammad, it was upon dramatic, articulate Malcolm X that the communications media and hence the general public focused the great bulk of their attention. I never dreamed, though, what Malcolm X was actually going through. He never breathed a word, at least not to me, until the actual rift became public.\n\nWhen Malcolm X left me at around two A.M. on that occasion, he asked me to call him at nine A.M. The telephone in the home in East Elmhurst rang considerably longer than usual, and Sister Betty, when she answered, sounded strained, choked up. When Malcolm X came on, he, too, sounded different. He asked me, \"Have you heard the radio or seen the newspapers?\" I said I hadn't. He said, \"Well, do!\" and that he would call me later.\n\nI went and got the papers. I read with astonishment that Malcolm X had been suspended by Elijah Muhammad -- the stated reason being the \"chickens coming home to roost\" remark that Malcolm X recently had made as a comment upon the assassination of President Kennedy.\n\nMalcolm X did telephone, after about an hour, and I met him at the Black Muslims' newspaper office in Harlem, a couple of blocks further up Lenox Avenue from their mosque and restaurant. He was seated behind his light brown metal desk and his brown hat lay before him on the green blotter. He wore a dark suit with a vest, a white shirt, the inevitable leaping-sailfish clip held his narrow tie, and the big feet in the shined black shoes pushed the swivel chair pendulously back and forth as he talked into the telephone.\n\n\"I'm always hurt over any act of disobedience on my part concerning Mr. Muhammad. . . . Yes, sir -- anything The Honorable Elijah Muhammad does is all right with me. I believe absolutely in his wisdom and authority.\" The telephone would ring again instantly every time he put it down. \"Mr. Peter Goldman! I haven't heard your voice in a good while! Well, sir, I just should have kept my big mouth shut.\" To the New York Times: \"Sir? Yes -- he suspended me from making public appearances for the time being, which I fully understand. I say the same thing to you that I have told others, I'm in complete submission to Mr. Muhammad's judgment, because I have always found his judgment to be based on sound thinking.\" To C.B.S.: \"I think that anybody who is in a position to discipline others should first learn to accept discipline himself.\"\n\nHe brought it off, the image of contriteness, the best he could -- throughout the harshly trying next several weeks. But the back of his neck was reddish every time I saw him. He did not yet put into words his obvious fury at the public humiliation. We did very little interviewing now, he was so busy on telephones elsewhere; but it did not matter too much because by now I had the bulk of the needed life story material in hand. When he did find some time to visit me, he was very preoccupied, and I could feel him rankling with anger and with inactivity, but he tried hard to hide it.\n\nHe scribbled one night, \"You have not converted a man because you have silenced him. John Viscount Morley.\" And the same night, almost illegibly, \"I was going downhill until he picked me up, but the more I think of it, we picked each other up.\"\n\nWhen I did not see him for several days, a letter came. \"I have cancelled all public appearances and speaking engagements for a number of weeks. So within that period it should be possible to finish this book. With the fast pace of newly developing incidents today, it is easy for something that is done or said tomorrow to be outdated even by sunset on the same day. Malcolm X.\"\n\nI pressed to get the first chapter, \"Nightmare,\" into a shape that he could review. When it was ready in a readable rough draft, I telephoned him. He came as quickly as he could drive from his home -- which made me see how grinding an ordeal it was to him to just be sitting at home, inactive, and knowing his temperament, my sympathies went out to Sister Betty.\n\nHe pored over the manuscript pages, raptly the first time, then drawing out his red-ink ball-point pen he read through the chapter again, with the pen occasionally stabbing at something. \"You can't bless Allah!\" he exclaimed, changing \"bless\" to \"praise.\" In a place that referred to himself and his brothers and sisters, he scratched red through \"we kids.\" \"Kids are goats!\" he exclaimed sharply.\n\nSoon, Malcolm X and his family flew to Miami. Cassius Clay had extended the invitation as a sixth wedding anniversary present to Malcolm X and Sister Betty, and they had accepted most gratefully. It was Sister Betty's first vacation in the six years of the taut regimen as a Black Muslim wife, and it was for Malcolm X both a saving of face and something to do.\n\nVery soon after his arrival, he telegraphed me his phone number at a motel. I called him and he told me, \"I just want to tell you something. I'm not a betting man anymore, but if you are, you bet on Cassius to beat Liston, and you will win.\" I laughed and said he was prejudiced. He said, \"Remember what I told you when the fight's over.\" I received later a picture postcard, the picture in vivid colors being of a chimpanzee at the Monkey Jungle in Miami. Malcolm X had written on the reverse side, \"One hundred years after the Civil War, and these chimpanzees get more recognition, respect and freedom in America than our people do. Bro. Malcolm X.\" Another time, an envelope came, and inside it was a clipping of an Irv Kupcinet column in the Chicago Sun-Times. Malcolm X's red pen had encircled an item which read, \"Insiders are predicting a split in the Black Muslims. Malcolm X, ousted as No. 2 man in the organization, may form a splinter group to oppose Elijah Muhammad.\" Alongside the item, Malcolm X had scribbled \"Imagine this!!!\"\n\nThe night of the phenomenal upset, when Clay did beat Liston, Malcolm X telephoned me, and sounds of excitement were in the background. The victory party was in his motel suite, Malcolm X told me. He described what was happening, mentioned some of those who were present, and that the new heavyweight king was \"in the next room, my bedroom here\" taking a nap. After reminding me of the fight prediction he had made, Malcolm X said that I should look forward now to Clay's \"quick development into a major world figure. I don't know if you really realize the world significance that this is the first Muslim champion.\"\n\nIt was the following morning when Cassius Clay gave the press interview which resulted in national headlines that he was actually a \"Black Muslim,\" and soon after, the newspapers were carrying pictures of Malcolm X introducing the heavyweight champion to various African diplomats in the lobbies of the United Nations headquarters in New York City. Malcolm X toured Clay about in Harlem, and in other places, functioning, he said, as Clay's \"friend and religious advisor.\"\n\nI had now moved upstate to finish my work on the book, and we talked on the telephone every three or four days. He said things suggesting that he might never be returned to his former Black Muslim post, and he now began to say things quietly critical of Elijah Muhammad. Playboy magazine asked me to do an interview for them with the new champion Cassius Clay, and when I confidently asked Malcolm X to arrange for me the needed introduction to Clay, Malcolm X hesitantly said, \"I think you had better ask somebody else to do that.\" I was highly surprised at the reply, but I had learned never to press him for information. And then, very soon after, I received a letter. \"Dear Alex Haley: A quick note. Would you prepare a properly worded letter that would enable me to change the reading of the contract so that all remaining proceeds now would go to the Muslim Mosque, Inc., or in the case of my death then to go directly to my wife, Mrs. Betty X Little? The sooner this letter or contract is changed, the more easily I will rest.\" Under the signature of Malcolm X, there was a P.S.: \"How is it possible to write one's autobiography in a world so fast-changing as this?\"\n\nSoon I read in the various newspapers that rumors were being heard of threats on Malcolm X's life. Then there was an article in the Amsterdam News: The caption was \"Malcolm X Tells Of Death Threat,\" and the story reported that he had said that former close associates of his in the New York mosque had sent out \"a special squad\" to \"try to kill me in cold blood. Thanks to Allah, I learned of the plot from the very same brothers who had been sent out to murder me. These brothers had heard me represent and defend Mr. Muhammad for too long for them to swallow the lies about me without first asking me some questions for their own clarification.\"\n\nI telephoned Malcolm X, and expressed my personal concern for him. His voice sounded weary. He said that his \"uppermost interest\" was that any money which might come due him in the future would go directly to his new organization, or to his wife, as the letter he had signed and mailed had specified. He told me, \"I know I've got to get a will made for myself, I never did because I never have had anything to will to anybody, but if I don't have one and something happened to me, there could be a mess.\" I expressed concern for him, and he told me that he had a loaded rifle in his home, and \"I can take care of myself.\"\n\nThe \"Muslim Mosque, Inc.\" to which Malcolm X had referred was a new organization which he had formed, which at that time consisted of perhaps forty or fifty Muslims who had left the leadership of Elijah Muhammad.\n\nThrough a close associate of Cassius Clay, whom Malcolm X had finally suggested to me, my interview appointment was arranged with the heavyweight champion, and I flew down to New York City to do the interview for Playboy. Malcolm X was \"away briefly,\" Sister Betty said on the phone -- and she spoke brusquely. I talked with one Black Muslim lady whom I had known before she had joined, and who had been an admirer of Malcolm X. She had elected to remain in the original fold, \"but I'll tell you, brother, what a lot in the mosque are saying, you know, it's like if you divorced your husband, you'd still like to see him once in a while.\" During my interviews with Cassius Clay in his three-room suite at Harlem's Theresa Hotel, inevitably the questions got around to Clay's Muslim membership, then to a query about what had happened to his formerly very close relationship with Malcolm X. Evenly, Clay said, \"You just don't buck Mr. Muhammad and get away with it. I don't want to talk about him no more.\"\n\nElijah Muhammad at his headquarters in Chicago grew \"emotionally affected\" whenever the name of Malcolm X had to be raised in his presence, one of the Muslims in Clay's entourage told me. Mr. Muhammad reportedly had said, \"Brother Malcolm got to be a big man. I made him big. I was about to make him a great man.\" The faithful Black Muslims predicted that soon Malcolm X would be turned upon by the defectors from Mosque Number 7 who had joined him: \"They will feel betrayed.\" Said others, \"A great chastisement of Allah will fall upon a hypocrite.\" Mr. Muhammad reportedly had said at another time, \"Malcolm is destroying himself,\" and that he had no wish whatever to see Malcolm X die, that he \"would rather see him live and suffer his treachery.\"\n\nThe general feeling among Harlemites, non-Muslims, with whom I talked was that Malcolm X had been powerful and influential enough a minister that eventually he would split the mosque membership into two hostile camps, and that in New York City at least, Elijah Muhammad's unquestioned rule would be ended.\n\nMalcolm X returned. He said that he had been in Boston and Philadelphia. He spent ample time with me, now during the day, in Room 1936 in the Hotel Americana. His old total ease was no longer with him. As if it was the most natural thing in the world to do, at sudden intervals he would stride to the door; pulling it open, he would look up and down the corridor, then shut the door again. \"If I'm alive when this book comes out, it will be a miracle,\" he said by way of explanation. \"I'm not saying it distressingly --\" He leaned forward and touched the buff gold bedspread. \"I'm saying it like I say that's a bedspread.\"\n\nFor the first time he talked with me in some detail about what had happened. He said that his statement about President Kennedy's assassination was not why he had been ousted from the Muslims. \"It wasn't the reason at all. Nobody said anything when I made stronger statements before.\" The real reason, he said, was \"jealousy in Chicago, and I had objected to the immorality of the man who professed to be more moral than anybody.\"\n\nMalcolm X said that he had increased the Nation of Islam membership from about four hundred when he had joined to around forty thousand. \"I don't think there were more than four hundred in the country when I joined, I really don't. They were mostly older people, and many of them couldn't even pronounce Mr. Muhammad's name, and he stayed mostly in the background.\"\n\nMalcolm X worked hard not to show it, but he was upset. \"There is nothing more frightful than ignorance in action. Goethe,\" he scribbled one day. He hinted about Cassius Clay a couple of times, and when I responded only with anecdotes about my interview with Clay, he finally asked what Clay had said of him. I dug out the index card on which the question was typed in advance and Clay's response was beneath in longhand. Malcolm X stared at the card, then out of the window, and he got up and walked around; one of the few times I ever heard his voice betray his hurt was when he said, \"I felt like a blood bigbrother to him.\" He paused. \"I'm not against him now. He's a fine young man. Smart. He's just let himself be used, led astray.\"\n\nAnd at another time there in the hotel room he came the nearest to tears that I ever saw him, and also the only time I ever heard him use, for his race, one word. He had been talking about how hard he had worked building up the Muslim organization in the early days when he was first moved to New York City, when abruptly he exclaimed hoarsely, \"We had the best organization the black man's ever had -- niggers ruined it!\"\n\nA few days later, however, he wrote in one of his memo books this, which he let me read, \"Children have a lesson adults should learn, to not be ashamed of failing, but to get up and try again. Most of us adults are so afraid, so cautious, so `safe,' and therefore so shrinking and rigid and afraid that it is why so many humans fail. Most middle-aged adults have resigned themselves to failure.\"\n\nTelephone calls came frequently for Malcolm X when he was in the room with me, or he would make calls; he would talk in a covert, guarded manner, clearly not wishing me to be able to follow the discussion. I took to going into the bathroom at these times, and closing the door, emerging when the murmuring of his voice had stopped -- hoping that made him more comfortable. Later, he would tell me that he was hearing from some Muslims who were still ostensibly Elijah Muhammad's followers. \"I'm a marked man,\" he said one day, after such a call. \"I've had highly placed people tell me to be very careful every move I make.\" He thought about it. \"Just as long as my family doesn't get hurt, I'm not frightened for myself.\" I have the impression that Malcolm X heard in advance that the Muslim organization was going to sue to make him vacate the home he and his family lived in.\n\nI had become worried that Malcolm X, bitter, would want to go back through the chapters in which he had told of his Black Muslim days and re-edit them in some way. The day before I left New York City to return upstate, I raised my concern to Malcolm X. \"I have thought about that,\" he said. \"There are a lot of things I could say that passed through my mind at times even then, things I saw and heard, but I threw them out of my mind. I'm going to let it stand the way I've told it. I want the book to be the way it was.\"\n\nThen -- March 26, 1964 -- a note came from Malcolm X: \"There is a chance that I may make a quick trip to several very important countries in Africa, including a pilgrimage to the Muslim Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina, beginning about April 13th. Keep this to yourself.\"\n\nWhile abroad, Malcolm X wrote letters and postcards to almost everyone he knew well. His letters now were signed \"El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz.\"\n\nThen, in mid-May, Sister Betty telephoned me, her voice jubilant: Malcolm X was returning. I flew to New York City. On May 21, the phone rang in my hotel room and Sister Betty said, \"Just a minute, please --\" then the deep voice said, \"How are you?\"\n\n\"Well! El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz! How are you?\"\n\nHe said, \"Just a little bit tired.\" He had arrived on a Pan-American\n\nAirlines flight at 4:30. He was going to have a press conference at seven P.M. at the Hotel Theresa. \"I'll pick you up at 6:30 at 135th and Lenox, on the uptown side -- all right?\"\n\nWhen the blue Oldsmobile stopped, and I got in, El-Hajj Malcolm, broadly beaming, wore a seersucker suit, the red hair needed a barber's attention, and he had grown a beard. Also in the car was Sister Betty. It was the first time we had ever seen each other after more than a year of talking several times a week on the telephone. We smiled at each other. She wore dark glasses, a blue maternity suit, and she was pregnant with what would be her fourth child.\n\nThere must have been fifty still and television photographers and reporters jockeying for position, up front, and the rest of the Skyline Ballroom was filling with Negro followers of Malcolm X, or his well-wishers, and the curious. The room lit up with flickering and flooding lights as he came in the door squiring Sister Betty, holding her arm tenderly, and she was smiling broadly in her pride that this man was her man. I recognized the Times' M. S. Handler and introduced myself; we warmly shook hands and commandeered a little two-chair table. The reporters in a thick semicircle before Malcolm X seated on the podium fired questions at him, and he gave the impression that all of his twelve years' oratorical practice had prepared him for this new image.\n\n\"Do we correctly understand that you now do not think that all whites are evil?\"\n\n\"True, sir! My trip to Mecca has opened my eyes. I no longer subscribe to racism. I have adjusted my thinking to the point where I believe that whites are human beings\" -- a significant pause -- \"as long as this is borne out by their humane attitude toward Negroes.\"\n\nThey picked at his \"racist\" image. \"I'm not a racist. I'm not condemning whites for being whites, but for their needs. I condemn what whites collectively have done to our people collectively.\"\n\nHe almost continually flashed about the room the ingratiating boyish smile. He would pick at the new reddish beard. They asked him about that, did he plan to keep it? He said he hadn't decided yet, he would have to see if he could get used to it or not. Was he maneuvering to now join the major civil rights leaders whom he had previously bitterly attacked? He answered that one sideways: \"I'll explain it this way, sir. If some men are in a car, driving with a destination in mind, and you know they are going the wrong way, but they are convinced they are going the right way, then you get into the car with them, and ride with them, talking -- and finally when they see they are on the wrong road, not getting where they were intending, then you tell them, and they will listen to you then, what road to take.\" He had never been in better form, weighing, parrying, answering the questions.\n\nThe Times' Handler, beside me, was taking notes and muttering under his breath, \"Incredible! Incredible!\" I was thinking the same thing. I was thinking, some of the time, that if a pebble were dropped from the window behind Malcolm X, it would have struck on a sidewalk eight floors below where years before he had skulked, selling dope.\n\nAs I resumed writing upstate, periodic notes came from Malcolm X. \"I hope the book is proceeding rapidly, for events concerning my life happen so swiftly, much of what has already been written can easily be outdated from month to month. In life, nothing is permanent; not even life itself (smile). So I would advise you to rush it on out as fast as possible.\" Another note, special delivery, had a tone of irritation with me: he had received from the publisher a letter which indicated that he had received a $2500 check when the book contract was signed, \"and therefore I will be expected to pay personal income tax on this. As you know, it was my repeated specification that this entire transaction was to be made at that time directly with and to the Mosque. In fact, I have never seen that check to this very day.\"\n\nThe matter was straightened out, and I sent Malcolm X some rough chapters to read. I was appalled when they were soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning Malcolm X, I reminded him of his previous decision, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what would lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. Malcolm X said, gruffly, \"Whose book is this?\" I told him \"Yours, of course,\" and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. He said that he would have to think about it. I was heartsick at the prospect that he might want to re-edit the entire book into a polemic against Elijah Muhammad. But late that night, Malcolm X telephoned. \"I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.\" I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said. And the only thing that he ever indicated that he wished had been different in his life came when he was reading the chapter \"Laura.\" He said, \"That was a smart girl, a good girl. She tried her best to make something out of me, and look what I started her into -- dope and prostitution. I wrecked that girl.\"\n\nMalcolm X was busy, busy, busy; he could not visit my hotel room often, and when he did, it shortly would get the feeling of Grand Central Station. It seemed that when the telephone was not ringing for him, he was calling someone else, consulting the jotted numbers in his ever-ready memorandum book. Now he had begun to talk a great deal with various people from the Middle East or Africa who were in New York. Some of these came to see him at the hotel room. At first, I would sit by the window engrossed in reading while they talked by the room's door in low tones. He was very apologetic when this occurred, and I told him I felt no sensitivity about it; then, afterwards, I would generally step out into the hallway, or perhaps take the elevator down to the lobby, then watch the elevators until I saw the visitor leave. One day, I remember, the phone had rung steadily with such callers as C.B.S., A.B.C., N.B.C., every New York City paper, the London Daily Express, and numerous individuals -- he and I had gotten no work at all accomplished; then a television camera crew arrived and filled the room to tape an interview with Malcolm X by A.B.C.'s commentator Bill Beutel. As the crew was setting up its floodlights on tripods, a Dayton,\n\nOhio, radio station called, wishing to interview Malcolm X by telephone. He asked me to ask them to call him the following day at his sister Ella's home in Boston. Then the Ghana Ministry of Information called. I turned with a note to Malcolm X to whom the commentator Beutel had just said, \"I won't take much of your time, I just have a few probably stupid questions.\" Glancing at my note, Malcolm X said to Beutel, \"Only the unasked question is stupid,\" and then to me, \"Tell them I'll call them back, please.\" Then just as the television cameras began rolling, with Beutel and Malcolm X talking, the telephone rang again and it was Life magazine reporter Marc Crawford to whom I whispered what was happening. Crawford, undaunted, asked if the open receiver could be placed where he could hear the interview, and I complied, relieved that it was one way to let the interview proceed without interruption.\n\nThe manuscript copy which Malcolm X was given to review was in better shape now, and he pored through page by page, intently, and now and then his head would raise with some comment. \"You know,\" he said once, \"why I have been able to have some effect is because I make a study of the weaknesses of this country and because the more the white man yelps, the more I know I have struck a nerve.\" Another time, he put down upon the bed the manuscript he was reading, and he got up from his chair and walked back and forth, stroking his chin, then he looked at me. \"You know this place here in this chapter where I told you how I put the pistol up to my head and kept pulling the trigger and scared them so when I was starting the burglary ring -- well,\" he paused, \"I don't know if I ought to tell you this or not, but I want to tell the truth.\" He eyed me, speculatively. \"I palmed the bullet.\" We laughed together. I said, \"Okay, give that page here, I'll fix it.\" Then he considered, \"No, leave it that way. Too many people would be so quick to say that's what I'm doing today, bluffing.\"\n\nAgain when reading about the period when he had discovered the prison library, Malcolm X's head jerked up. \"Boy! I never will forget that old aardvark!\" The next evening, he came into the room and told me that he had been to the Museum of Natural History and learned something about the aardvark. \"Now, aardvark actually means `earth hog.' That's a good example of root words, as I was telling you. When you study the science of philology, you learn the laws governing how a consonant can lose its shape, but it keeps its identity from language to language.\" What astonished me here was that I knew that on that day, Malcolm X's schedule had been crushing, involving both a television and radio appearance and a live speech, yet he had gone to find out something about the aardvark.\n\nBefore long, Malcolm X called a press conference, and announced, \"My new Organization of Afro-American Unity is a non-religious and non-sectarian group organized to unite Afro-Americans for a constructive program toward attainment of human rights.\" The new OAAU's tone appeared to be one of militant black nationalism. He said to the questions of various reporters in subsequent interviews that the OAAU would seek to convert the Negro population from non-violence to active self-defense against white supremacists across America. On the subject of politics he offered an enigma, \"Whether you use bullets or ballots, you've got to aim well; don't strike at the puppet, strike at the puppeteer.\" Did he envision any special area of activity? \"I'm going to join in the fight wherever Negroes ask for my help.\" What about alliance with other Negro organizations? He said that he would consider forming some united front with certain selected Negro leaders. He conceded under questioning that the N.A.A.C.P. was \"doing some good.\" Could any whites join his OAAU? \"If John Brown were alive, maybe him.\" And he answered his critics with such statements as that he would send \"armed guerrillas\" into Mississippi. \"I am dead serious. We will send them not only to Mississippi, but to any place where black people's lives are threatened by white bigots. As far as I am concerned, Mississippi is anywhere south of the Canadian border.\" At another time, when Evelyn Cunningham of the Pittsburgh Courier asked Malcolm X in a kidding way, \"Say something startling for my column,\" he told her, \"Anyone who wants to follow me and my movement has got to be ready to go to jail, to the hospital, and to the cemetery before he can be truly free.\" Evelyn Cunningham, printing the item, commented, \"He smiled and chuckled, but he was in dead earnest.\"\n\nHis fourth child, yet another daughter, was born and he and Sister Betty named the baby Gamilah Lumumbah. A young waitress named Helen Lanier, at Harlem's Twenty Two Club where Malcolm X now often asked people to meet him, gave him a layette for the new baby. He was very deeply touched by the gesture. \"Why, I hardly know that girl!\"\n\nHe was clearly irked when a New York Times poll among New York City Negroes reflected that three-fourths had named Dr. Martin Luther King as \"doing the best work for Negroes,\" and another one-fifth had voted for the N.A.A.C.P.'s Roy wilkins, while only six percent had voted for Malcolm X. \"Brother,\" he said to me, \"do you realize that some of history's greatest leaders never were recognized until they were safely in the ground!\"\n\nOne morning in mid-summer 1964, Malcolm X telephoned me and said that he would be leaving \"within the next two or three days\" for a planned six weeks abroad. I heard from him first in Cairo, about as the predicted \"long, hot summer\" began in earnest, with riots and other uprisings of Negroes occurring in surburban Philadelphia, in Rochester, in Brooklyn, in Harlem, and other cities. The New York Times reported that a meeting of Negro intellectuals had agreed that Dr. Martin Luther King could secure the allegiance of the middle and upper classes of Negroes, but Malcolm X alone could secure the allegiance of Negroes at the bottom. \"The Negroes respect Dr. King and Malcolm X because they sense in these men absolute integrity and know they will never sell them out. Malcolm X cannot be corrupted and the Negroes know this and therefore respect him. They also know that he comes from the lower depths, as they do, and regard him as one of their own. Malcolm X is going to play a formidable role, because the racial struggle has now shifted to the urban North . . . if Dr. King is convinced that he has sacrificed ten years of brilliant leadership, he will be forced to revise his concepts. There is only one direction in which he can move, and that is in the direction of Malcolm X.\" I sent a clipping of that story to Malcolm X in Cairo.\n\nIn Washington, D.C. and New York City, at least, powerful civic, private, and governmental agencies and individuals were keenly interested in what Malcolm X was saying abroad, and were speculating upon what would he say, and possibly do, when he returned to America. In upstate New York, I received a telephone call from a close friend who said he had been asked to ask me if I would come to New York City on an appointed day to meet with \"a very high government official\" who was interested in Malcolm X. I did fly down to the city. My friend accompanied me to the offices of a large private foundation well known for its activities and donations in the civil rights area. I met the foundation's president and he introduced me to the Justice Department Civil Rights Section head, Burke Marshall. Marshall was chiefly interested in Malcolm X's finances, particularly how his extensive traveling since his Black Muslim ouster had been paid for. I told him that to the best of my knowledge the several payments from the publisher had financed Malcolm X, along with fees he received for some speeches, and possible donations that his organization received, and that Malcolm X had told me of borrowing money from his Sister Ella for the current trip, and that recently the Saturday Evening Post had bought the condensation rights of the book for a substantial sum that was soon to be received. Marshall listened quietly, intently, and asked a few questions concerning other aspects of Malcolm X's life, then thanked me. I wrote to Malcolm X in Cairo that night about the interview. He never mentioned it.\n\nThe Saturday Evening Post flew photographer John Launois to Cairo to locate Malcolm X and photograph him in color. The magazine's September 12 issue appeared, and I sent a copy by airmail to Malcolm X. Within a few days, I received a stinging note, expressing his anger at the magazine's editorial regarding his life story. (The editorial's opening sentence read, \"If Malcolm X were not a Negro, his autobiography would be little more than a journal of abnormal psychology, the story of a burglar, dope pusher, addict and jailbird -- with a family history of insanity -- who acquires messianic delusions and sets forth to preach an upside-down religion of `brotherly' hatred.\") I wrote to Malcolm X that he could not fairly hold me responsible for what the magazine had written in a separate editorial opinion. He wrote an apology, \"but the greatest care must be exercised in the future.\"\n\nHis return from Africa was even more auspicious than when he had returned from the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. A large group of Negroes, his followers and well-wishers, kept gathering in the Overseas Arrival Building at Kennedy Airport. When I entered, white men with cameras were positioned on the second level, taking pictures of all the Negroes who entered, and almost as obvious were Negro plainclothesmen moving about. Malcolm's greeters had draped across the glass overlooking the U.S. Customs Inspection line some large cloth banners on which were painted in bold letters, \"Welcome Home, Malcolm.\"\n\nHe came in sight, stepping into one of the Customs Inspection lines; he heard the cheering and he looked up, smiling his pleasure.\n\n\n\nMalcolm X wanted to \"huddle\" with me to fill me in on details from his trip that he wanted in the book. He said that he was giving me only the highlights, because he felt that his carefully kept diary might be turned into another book. We had intensive sessions in my hotel room, where he read what he selected from the diary, and I took notes. \"What I want to stress is that I was trying to internationalize our problem,\" he said to me, \"to make the Africans feel their kinship with us Afro-Americans. I made them think about it, that they are our blood brothers, and we all came from the same foreparents. That's why the Africans loved me, the same way the Asians loved me because I was religious.\"\n\nWithin a few days, he had no more time to see me. He would call and apologize; he was beset by a host of problems, some of which he mentioned, and some of which I heard from other people. Most immediately, there was discontent within his organization, the OAAU. His having stayed away almost three times as long as he had said he would be gone had sorely tested the morale of even his key members, and there was a general feeling that his interest was insufficient to expect his followers' interest to stay high. I heard from one member that \"a growing disillusion\" could be sensed throughout the organization.\n\nIn Harlem at large, in the bars and restaurants, on the street corners and stoops, there could be heard more blunt criticism of Malcolm X than ever before in his career. There were, variously expressed, two primary complaints. One was that actually Malcolm X only talked, but other civil rights organizations were doing. \"All he's ever done was talk, CORE and SNCC and some of them people of Dr. King's are out getting beat over the head.\" The second major complaint was that Malcolm X was himself too confused to be seriously followed any longer. \"He doesn't know what he believes in. No sooner do you hear one thing than he's switched to something else.\" The two complaints were not helping the old firebrand Malcolm X image any, nor were they generating the local public interest that was badly needed by his small, young OAAU.\n\nA court had made it clear that Malcolm X and his family would have to vacate the Elmhurst house for its return to the adjudged legal owners, Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam. And other immediate problems which Malcolm X faced included finances. Among his other expenses, a wife and four daughters had to be supported, along with at least one full-time OAAU official. Upon his return from Africa, our agent for the book had delivered to me for Malcolm X a check for a sizable sum; soon afterward Malcolm X told me, laughing wryly, \"It's evaporated. I don't know where!\"\n\nMalcolm X plunged into a welter of activities. He wrote and telephoned dozens of acceptances to invitations to speak, predominantly at colleges and universities -- both to expound his philosophies and to earn the $150-$300 honorariums above traveling expenses. When he was in New York City, he spent all the time he could in his OAAU's sparsely furnished office on the mezzanine floor of the Hotel Theresa, trying to do something about the OAAU's knotty problems. \"I'm not exposing our size in numbers,\" he evaded the query of one reporter. \"You know, the strongest part of a tree is the root, and if you expose the root, the tree dies. Why, we have many `invisible' members, of all types. Unlike other leaders, I've practiced the flexibility to put myself into contact with every kind of Negro in the country.\"\n\nEven at mealtimes, at his favorite Twenty Two Club, or elsewhere in Harlem, he could scarcely eat for the people who came up asking for appointments to discuss with him topics ranging from personal problems to his opinions on international issues. It seemed not in him to say \"No\" to such requests. And aides of his, volunteering their time, as often as not had to wait lengthy periods to get his ear for matters important to the OAAU, or to himself; often, even then, he most uncharacteristically showed an impatience with their questions or their suggestions, and they chafed visibly. And at least once weekly, generally on Sunday evenings, he would address as many Negroes as word of mouth and mimeographed advertising could draw to hear him in Harlem's Audubon Ballroom on West 166th Street between Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue, near New York City's famous Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.\n\nMalcolm X for some reason suddenly began to deliver a spate of attacks against Elijah Muhammad, making more bitter accusations of \"religious fakery\" and \"immorality\" than he ever had. Very possibly, Malcolm X had grown increasingly incensed by the imminence of the court's deadline for him to have to move his wife and four little daughters from the comfortable home in which they had lived for years in Elmhurst. And Sister Betty was again pregnant. \"A home is really the only thing I've ever provided Betty since we've been married,\" he had told me, discussing the court's order, \"and they want to take that away. Man, I can't keep on putting her through changes, all she's put up with -- man, I've got to love this woman!\"\n\nA rash of death threats were anonymously telephoned to the police, to various newspapers, to the OAAU office, and to the family's home in Elmhurst. When he went to court again, fighting to keep the house, he was guarded by a phalanx of eight OAAU men, twenty uniformed policemen, and twelve plain-clothes detectives. The court's decision was that the order to vacate would not be altered. When Malcolm X reached home in Long Island, one of his followers, telephoning him there, got, instead, a telephone company operator who said that the OL 1-6320 number was \"disconnected.\" A carload of his OAAU followers, racing to Long Island, found Malcolm X and his family perfectly safe. Inquiry of the telephone company revealed that a \"Mrs. Small\" had called and requested that the service for that number be disconnected, \"for vacation.\" The OAAU followers drove back to Harlem. There was an ensuing confrontation between them and followers of Elijah Muhammad in front of the Black Muslim restaurant at 116th Street and Lenox Avenue. The incident wound up with policemen who rushed to the scene finding two guns in the OAAU car, and the six OAAU men were arrested.\n\nMalcolm X had a date to speak in Boston, but he was too busy to go, and he sent an OAAU assistant who spoke instead. The car returning him to the Boston Airport was blocked at the East Boston Tunnel by another car. Reportedly, men with knives rushed out of the blockade car, but the Malcolm X forces showed a shotgun, and the attackers dispersed.\n\nMalcolm X steadily accused the Black Muslims as the source of the various attacks and threats. \"There is no group in the United States more able to carry out this threat than the Black Muslims,\" he said. \"I know, because I taught them myself.\" Asked why he had attacked the Black Muslims and Elijah Muhammad when things had seemed to be cooled down, he said, \"I would not have revealed any of this if they had left me alone.\" He let himself be photographed in his home holding an automatic carbine rifle with a full double clip of ammunition that he said he kept ready for action against any possible assassination efforts. \"I have taught my wife to use it, and instructed her to fire on anyone, white, black, or yellow, who tries to force his way inside.\"\n\nI went to New York City in December for Malcolm X's reading of final additions to the manuscript, to include the latest developments. He was further than I had ever seen him from his old assured self, it seemed to me. He kept saying that the press was making light of his statements about the threats on his life. \"They act like I'm jiving!\" He brought up again the Saturday Evening Post editorial. \"You can't trust the publishing people, I don't care what they tell you.\" The agent for the book sent to my hotel a contract dealing with foreign publication rights which needed Malcolm X's and my signature. I signed it as he observed and handed the pen to him. He looked suspiciously at the contract, and said, \"I had better show this thing to my lawyer,\" and put the contract in his inside coat pocket. Driving in Harlem about an hour later, he suddenly stopped the car across the street from the 135th Street Y.M.C.A. Building. Withdrawing the contract, he signed it, and thrust it to me. \"I'll trust you,\" he said, and drove on.\n\nWith Christmas approaching, upon an impulse I bought for Malcolm X's two oldest daughters two large dolls, with painted brown complexions, the kind of dolls that would \"walk\" when held by the left hand. When Malcolm X next came to my room in the Hotel Wellington, I said, \"I've gotten something for you to take to Attallah and Qubilah for Christmas gifts,\" and I \"walked\" out the dolls. Amazement, then a wide grin spread over his face. \"Well, what do you know about that? Well, how about that!\" He bent to examine the dolls. His expression showed how touched he was. \"You know,\" he said after a while, \"this isn't something I'm proud to say, but I don't think I've ever bought one gift for my children. Everything they play with, either Betty got it for them, or somebody gave it to them, never me. That's not good, I know it. I've always been too busy.\"\n\nIn early January, I flew from upstate New York to Kennedy Airport where I telephoned Malcolm X at home and told him that I was waiting for another plane to Kansas City to witness the swearing-in of my younger brother George who had recently been elected a Kansas State Senator. \"Tell your brother for me to remember us in the alley,\" Malcolm X said. \"Tell him that he and all of the other moderate Negroes who are getting somewhere need to always remember that it was us extremists who made it possible.\" He said that when I was ready to leave Kansas, to telephone him saying when I would arrive back in New York, and if he could we could get together. I did this, and he met me at Kennedy Airport. He had only a little while, he was so pressed, he said; he had to leave that afternoon himself for a speaking engagement which had come up. So I made reservations for the next flight back upstate, then we went outside and sat and talked in his car in a parking lot. He talked about the pressures on him everywhere he turned, and about the frustrations, among them that no one wanted to accept anything relating to him except \"my old `hate' and `violence' image.\" He said \"the so-called moderate\" civil rights organizations avoided him as \"too militant\" and the \"so-called militants\" avoided him as \"too moderate.\" \"They won't let me turn the corner!\" he once exclaimed, \"I'm caught in a trap!\"\n\nIn a happier area, we talked about the coming baby. We laughed about the four girls in a row already. \"This one will be the boy,\" he said. He beamed, \"If not, the next one!\" When I said it was close to time for my plane to leave, he said he had to be getting on, too. I said, \"Give my best to Sister Betty,\" he said that he would, we shook hands and I got outside and stood as he backed the blue Oldsmobile from its parking space. I called out \"See you!\" and we waved as he started driving away. There was no way to know that it was the last time I would see him alive.\n\nOn January 19, Malcolm X appeared on the Pierre Berton television show in Canada and said, in response to a question about integration and intermarriage:\n\n\"I believe in recognizing every human being as a human being -- neither white, black, brown, or red; and when you are dealing with humanity as a family there's no question of integration or intermarriage. It's just one human being marrying another human being or one human being living around and with another human being. I may say, though, that I don't think it should ever be put upon a black man, I don't think the burden to defend any position should ever be put upon the black man, because it is the white man collectively who has shown that he is hostile toward integration and toward intermarriage and toward these other strides toward oneness. So as a black man and especially as a black American, any stand that I formerly took, I don't think that I would have to defend it because it's still a reaction to the society, and it's a reaction that was produced by the society; and I think that it is the society that produced this that should be attacked, not the reaction that develops among the people who are the victims of that negative society.\"\n\nFrom this, it would be fair to say that one month before his death, Malcolm had revised his views on intermarriage to the point where he regarded it as simply a personal matter.\n\nOn the 28th of January, Malcolm X was on TWA's Flight No. 9 from New York that landed at about three P.M. in Los Angeles. A special police intelligence squad saw Malcolm X greeted by two close friends, Edward Bradley and Allen Jamal, who drove him to the Statler-Hilton Hotel where Malcolm X checked into Room 1129. Said Bradley, \"As we entered the lobby, six men came in right after us. I recognized them as Black Muslims.\" When Malcolm X returned downstairs to the lobby, he \"practically bumped into the Muslim entourage. The Muslims were stunned. Malcolm's face froze, but he never broke his gait. Then, we knew we were facing trouble.\" Malcolm X's friends drove him to pick up \"two former secretaries of Elijah Muhammad, who (had) filed paternity suits against him,\" and they went to the office of the colorful Los Angeles attorney Gladys Root. Mrs. Root said that Malcolm X made accusations about Elijah Muhammad's conduct with various former secretaries.\n\nAfter dinner, Malcolm X's two friends drove him back to the hotel. \"Black Muslims were all over the place,\" Bradley related. \"Some were in cars and others stood around near the hotel. They had the hotel completely surrounded. Malcolm sized up the situation and jumped out of the car. He warned me to watch out and ran into the lobby. He went to his room and remained there for the rest of his stay in Los Angeles.\"\n\nThe car in which Malcolm X left the hotel, bound for the airport, was followed, said Bradley. \"Hardly had we got on the freeway when we saw two carloads of Black Muslims following us. The cars started to pull alongside. Malcolm picked up my walking cane and stuck it out of a back window as if it were a rifle. The two cars fell behind. We picked up speed, pulled off the airport ramp, and roared up to the front of the terminal. The police were waiting and Malcolm was escorted to the plane through an underground passageway. Then I saw Malcolm to the plane.\"\n\nChicago police were waiting when the plane landed at O'Hare Airport that night at eight o'clock. Driven to the Bristol Hotel, Malcolm X checked in, and the adjoining suite was taken by members of the police force who would keep him under steady guard for the next three days in Chicago. Malcolm X testified at the office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois which had been investigating the Nation of Islam. Another day he appeared on the television program of Irv Kupcinet; he described attempts that had been made to kill him. He said he had on his desk a letter naming the persons assigned to kill him. When police returned Malcolm X to his hotel \"at least fifteen grimfaced Negroes (were) loitering nearby.\" Whispered Malcolm X to Detective Sergeant Edward McClellan, \"Those are all Black Muslims. At least two of them I recognize as being from New York. Elijah seems to know every move I make.\" Later, in his room, he told the detective, \"It's only going to be a matter of time before they catch up with me. I know too much about the Muslims. But their threats are not going to stop me from what I am determined to do.\" After that night spent in the hotel, Malcolm X was police-escorted back to O'Hare where he caught a plane to New York City's Kennedy Airport.\n\nRight away, he was served with a court order of eviction from the Elmhurst home. He telephoned me upstate. His voice was strained. He told me that he had filed an appeal to the court order, that on the next day he was going to Alabama, and thence to England and France for scheduled speeches, and soon after returning he would go to Jackson, Mississippi, to address the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, on February 19. Then he said -- the first time he had ever voiced to me such an admission -- \"Haley, my nerves are shot, my brain's tired.\" He said that upon his return from Mississippi, he would like to come and spend two or three days in the town where I was, and read the book's manuscript again. \"You say it's a quiet town. Just a couple of days of peace and quiet, that's what I need.\" I said that he knew he was welcome, but there was no need for him to tax himself reading through the long book again, as it had only a few very minor editing changes since he had only recently read it. \"I just want to read it one more time,\" he said, \"because I don't expect to read it in finished form.\" So we made a tentative agreement that the day after his projected return from Mississippi, he would fly upstate to visit for a weekend with me. The projected date was the Saturday and Sunday of February 20-21.\n\nJet magazine reported Malcolm X's trip to Selma, Alabama, on the invitation of two members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Dr. Martin Luther King was in a Selma jail when Malcolm X's arrival sent officials of Dr. King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference \"into a tailspin.\" Quickly, the SCLC's Executive Director Reverend Andrew Young and Reverend James Bevel met with Malcolm X, urging him not to incite any incidents and cautioning him that his presence could cause violence. \"He listened with a smile,\" said Miss Faye Bellamy, secretary of the SNCC, who accompanied Malcolm X to a Negro church where he would address a mass meeting. \"Remember this: nobody puts words in my mouth,\" he told Miss Bellamy. He told her that \"in about two weeks\" he planned to start Southern recruiting for his Harlem-based OAAU. At the church where he would speak, Malcolm X was seated on the platform next to Mrs. Martin Luther King, to whom he leaned and whispered that he was \"trying to help,\" she told Jet. \"He said he wanted to present an alternative; that it might be easier for whites to accept Martin's proposals after hearing him (Malcolm X). I didn't understand him at first,\" said Mrs. King. \"He seemed rather anxious to let Martin know he was not causing trouble or making it difficult, but that he was trying to make it easier. . . . Later, in the hallway, he reiterated this. He seemed sincere. . . .\"\n\nAddressing the mass meeting Malcolm X reportedly shouted: \"I don't advocate violence, but if a man steps on my toes, I'll step on his.\" . . . \"Whites better be glad Martin Luther King is rallying the people because other forces are waiting to take over if he fails.\"\n\nReturned to New York City, Malcolm X soon flew to France. He was scheduled to speak before a Congress of African Students. But he was formally advised that he would not be permitted to speak and, moreover, that he could consider himself officially barred forever from France as \"an undesirable person.\" He was asked to leave -- and he did, fuming with indignation.\n\nHe flew on to London, and reporters of the British Broadcasting Corporation took him on an interviewing tour in Smethwick, a town near Birmingham with a large colored population. Numerous residents raised a storm of criticism that the B.B.C. was a party to a \"fanning of racism\" in the already tension-filled community. On this visit, he spoke also at the London School of Economics.\n\nMalcolm X returned to New York City on Saturday, February 13th. He was asleep with his family when at about a quarter of three the following Sunday morning, a terrifying blast awakened them. Sister Betty would tell me later that Malcolm X, barking commands and snatching up screaming, frightened children, got the family safely out of the back door into the yard. Someone had thrown flaming Molotov cocktail gasoline bombs through the front picture window. It took the fire department an hour to extinguish the flames. Half the house was destroyed. Malcolm X had no fire insurance.\n\nPregnant, distraught Sister Betty and the four little daughters went to the home of close friends. Malcolm X steeled himself to catch a plane as scheduled that morning to speak in Detroit. He wore an open-necked sweater shirt under his suit. Immediately afterward, he flew back to New York. Monday morning, amid a flurry of emergency re-housing plans for his family, Malcolm X was outraged when he learned that Elijah Muhammad's New York Mosque Number 7 Minister James X had told the press that Malcolm X himself had fire-bombed the home \"to get publicity.\"\n\nMonday night, Malcolm X spoke to an audience in the familiar Audubon Ballroom. If he had possessed the steel nerves not to become rattled in public before, now he was: \"I've reached the end of my rope!\" he shouted to the audience of five hundred. \"I wouldn't care for myself if they would not harm my family!\" He declared flatly, \"My house was bombed by the Muslims!\" And he hinted at revenge. \"There are hunters; there are also those who hunt the hunters!\"\n\nTuesday, February 16th, Malcolm X telephoned me. He spoke very briefly, saying that the complications following the bombing of his home had thrown his plans so awry that he would be unable to visit me upstate on the weekend as he had said he would. He said he had also had to cancel his planned trip to Jackson, Mississippi, which he was going to try and make later. He said he had to hurry to an appointment, and hung up. I would read later where also on that day, he told a close associate, \"I have been marked for death in the next five days. I have the names of five Black Muslims who have been chosen to kill me. I will announce them at the meeting.\" And Malcolm X told a friend that he was going to apply to the Police Department for a permit to carry a pistol. \"I don't know whether they will let me have one or not, as I served time in prison.\"\n\nOn Thursday he told a reporter, in an interview which did not appear until after his death: \"I'm man enough to tell you that I can't put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now, but I'm flexible.\"\n\nThe blackboard in the OAAU office counseled members and visitors that \"Bro. Malcolm Speaks Thurs. Feb. 18, WINS Station, 10:30 P.M.\" Earlier Thursday, Malcolm X discussed locating another home with a real estate dealer. On Friday, he had an appointment with Gordon Parks, the Life magazine photographer-author whom he had long admired and respected. \"He appeared calm and somewhat resplendent with his goatee and astrakhan hat,\" Parks would report later in Life. \"Much of the old hostility and bitterness seemed to have left him, but the fire and confidence were still there.\" Malcolm X, speaking of the old Mosque Number 7 days, said, \"That was a bad scene, brother. The sickness and madness of those days -- I'm glad to be free of them. It's a time for martyrs now. And if I'm to be one, it will be in the cause of brotherhood. That's the only thing that can save this country. I've learned it the hard way -- but I've learned it. . . .\"\n\nParks asked Malcolm X if it was really true that killers were after him. \"It's as true as we are standing here,\" Malcolm X said. \"They've tried it twice in the last two weeks.\" Parks asked him about police protection, and Malcolm X laughed, \"Brother, nobody can protect you from a Muslim but a Muslim -- or someone trained in Muslim tactics. I know. I invented many of those tactics.\"\n\nRecalling the incident of the young white college girl who had come to the Black Muslim restaurant and asked \"What can I do?\" and he told her \"Nothing,\" and she left in tears, Malcolm X told Gordon Parks, \"Well, I've lived to regret that incident. In many parts of the African continent I saw white students helping black people. Something like this kills a lot of argument. I did many things as a Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie then -- like all Muslims -- I was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess a man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. It cost me twelve years.\"\n\nSaturday morning, he drove Sister Betty to see a real estate man. The house that the man then showed them that Malcolm X particularly liked, in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood also on Long Island, required a $3000 down payment. Sister Betty indicated her approval, too, and Malcolm X told the real estate man he thought they would take it. Driving Sister Betty back to the friends' home where she was staying with the children, they estimated that it would cost them about another $1000 to make the move. He stayed until mid-afternoon with Sister Betty at the friends' home, talking. He told her that he realized that she had been under protracted great strain, and that he was sorry about it. When he got his hat to leave, to drive into Manhattan, standing in the hallway, he told Sister Betty, \"We'll all be together. I want my family with me. Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you. We'll get somebody to keep the children. I'll never leave you so long again.\"\n\n\"I couldn't help but just break out grinning,\" Sister Betty would later tell me.\n\nShe figured that he must have stopped at a nearby drugstore to use the telephone booth when I later told her that Malcolm X had telephoned me upstate at about 3:30 that afternoon.\n\nFor the first time in nearly two years, I did not recognize immediately that the voice on the other end of the phone belonged to Malcolm X. He sounded as if he had a heavy, deep cold. He told me that in the middle of the night he and some friends had helped a moving company's men take out of the other house all of the family's furniture and other belongings salvageable after the fire-bombing -- before a sheriff's eviction party would set the things out on the sidewalk. \"Betty and I have been looking at a house we want to buy\" -- he tried a chuckle -- \"you know nobody's going to rent, not to me, these days!\" He said, \"All I've got is about $150,\" and that he needed a $3000 down payment plus $1000 moving costs; he asked if I thought the publisher would advance him $4000 against the projected profits from the book. I said that when our agent's offices opened on Monday morning, I would telephone and I knew that he would query the publisher to see if it couldn't be arranged, then Monday night I would call him back and let him know.\n\nHe said that he and Sister Betty had decided that although they were going to pay for the house, to avoid possible trouble they had gotten the agreement of his sister Ella who lived in Boston to let the house be bought in her name. He said that he still owed $1500 to his sister Ella which she had loaned him to make one trip abroad. Eventually they would change the house's title into Sister Betty's name, he said, or maybe into the name of their oldest daughter, Attilah.\n\nHe digressed on the dangers he faced. \"But, you know, I'm going to tell you something, brother -- the more I keep thinking about this thing, the things that have been happening lately, I'm not all that sure it's the Muslims. I know what they can do, and what they can't, and they can't do some of the stuff recently going on. Now, I'm going to tell you, the more I keep thinking about what happened to me in France, I think I'm going to quit saying it's the Muslims.\"\n\nThen -- it seemed to me such an odd, abrupt change of subject: \"You know, I'm glad I've been the first to establish official ties between Afro-Americans and our blood brothers in Africa.\" And saying good-bye, he hung up.\n\nAfter that telephone call, Malcolm X drove on into Manhattan and to the New York Hilton Hotel between 53rd and 54th streets at Rockefeller Center. He checked the blue Oldsmobile into the hotel garage and then, in the lobby, he checked himself in and was assigned a twelfth-floor room, to which a bellman accompanied him.\n\nSoon some Negro men entered the giant hotel's busy lobby.\n\nThey began asking various bellmen what room Malcolm X was in. The bellmen, of course, never would answer that question concerning any guest -- and considering that it was Malcolm X whom practically everyone who read New York City newspapers knew was receiving constant death threats, the bellmen quickly notified the hotel's security chief. From then until Malcolm X checked out the next day, extra security vigilance was continuously maintained on the twelfth floor. During that time, Malcolm X left the room only once, to have dinner in the hotel's lobby-level, dimly lit Bourbon Room.\n\nSunday morning at nine o'clock, Sister Betty in Long Island was surprised when her husband telephoned her and asked if she felt it would be too much trouble for her to get all of the four children dressed and bring them to the two o'clock meeting that afternoon at the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem. She said, \"Of course it won't!\" On Saturday he had told her that she couldn't come to the meeting. He said to her, \"You know what happened an hour ago? Exactly at eight o'clock, the phone woke me up. Some man said, `Wake up, brother' and hung up.\" Malcolm X said good-bye to Sister Betty.\n\nAnd four hours later, Malcolm X left his room and took an elevator down to the lobby, where he checked out. He got his car and in the clear, warm midday of Sunday, February 21, he drove uptown to the Audubon Ballroom.\n\nThe Audubon Ballroom, between Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue, on the south side of West 166th Street, is a two-story building frequently rented for dances, organization functions, and other affairs. A dark, slender, pretty young lady, occupationally a receptionist and avocationally a hardworking OAAU assistant to Malcolm X, has since told me that she arrived early, about 1:30 P.M., having some preliminary work to do. Entering, she saw that the usual four hundred wooden chairs had been set up, with aisles on either side, but no center aisle; the young lady (she wishes to be nameless) noticed that several people were already seated in the front rows, but she gave it no thought since some always came early, liking to get seats up close to the stage, to savor to the fullest the dramatic orator Malcolm X. On the stage, behind the speaker's stand, were eight straight brown chairs arranged in a row and behind it was the stage's painted backdrop, a mural of a restful country scene. The young lady's responsibilities for this day had included making arrangements and subsequent confirmations with the scheduled co-speaker, the Reverend Milton Galamison, the militant Brooklyn Presbyterian who in 1964 had led the two one-day Negro boycotts in New York City public schools, protesting \"racial imbalance.\" She had similarly made arrangements with some other prominent Negroes who were due to appeal to the audience for their maximum possible contributions to aid the work of Malcolm X and his organization.\n\nThe people who entered the ballroom were not searched at the door. In recent weeks, Malcolm X had become irritable about this, saying \"It makes people uncomfortable\" and that it reminded him of Elijah Muhammad. \"If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be?\" he had once said testily. For this day, also, he had ordered the press -- as such -- barred, white or black. He was angry at what he interpreted as \"slanted\" press treatment recently; he felt especially that the newspapers had not taken seriously his statements of the personal danger he was in. United Press International reporter Stanley Scott, a Negro, had been admitted, he later said, when a Malcolm lieutenant decided, \"As a Negro, you will be allowed to enter as a citizen if you like, but you must remove your press badge.\" The same criterion had applied to WMCA newsman Hugh Simpson. Both he and Scott came early enough so that they obtained seats up near the stage.\n\nMalcolm X entered the ballroom at shortly before two o'clock, trudging heavily instead of with his usual lithe strides, his young lady assistant has told me. By this time several other of his assistants were filtering in and out of the small anteroom alongside the stage. He sat down sideways on a chair, his long legs folded around its bottom, and he leaned one elbow on a kind of counter before a rather rickety make-up mirror that entertainers used when dances were held in the ballroom. He wore a dark suit, white shirt and narrow dark tie. He said to a little group of his assistants that he wasn't going to talk about his personal troubles, \"I don't want that to be the reason for anyone to come to hear me.\" He stood up and paced about the little room. He said he was going to state that he had been hasty to accuse the Black Muslims of bombing his home. \"Things have happened since that are bigger than what they can do. I know what they can do. Things have gone beyond that.\"\n\nThose in the anteroom could hear the sounds of the enlarging audience outside taking seats. \"The way I feel, I ought not to go out there at all today,\" Malcolm X said. \"In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting among ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.\" He kept glancing at his wrist watch, anticipating the arrival of Reverend Galamison. \"Whenever you make any appointment with a minister,\" he said to his young lady assistant, \"you have to call them two or three hours before time, because they will change their mind. This is typical of ministers.\"\n\n\"I felt bad, I felt that it was my fault,\" the young lady told me. \"It was time for the meeting to start, too.\" She turned to Malcolm X's stalwart assistant Benjamin X, known as a highly able speaker himself. \"Brother, will you speak?\" she asked -- then, turning to Malcolm X, \"Is it all right if he speaks? And maybe he could introduce you.\" Malcolm X abruptly whirled on her, and barked, \"You know you shouldn't ask me right in front of him!\" Then, collecting himself quickly, he said \"Okay,\" Brother Benjamin X asked how long he should speak. Malcolm X said, glancing again at his wristwatch, \"Make it half an hour.\" And Brother Benjamin X went through the door leading onto the stage. They heard him expertly exhorting the audience about what is needed today by \"the black man here in these United States.\"\n\nThe Reverend Galamison and other notables due hadn't arrived by three o'clock. \"Brother Malcolm looked so disappointed,\" the young lady says. \"He said to me `I don't think any of them are coming, either.' I felt so terrible for him. It did seem as if no one cared. I told him `Oh, don't worry, they're just late, they'll be here.'\" (It was also reported by another source that Galamison, unable to come to the meeting, did telephone earlier, and that Malcolm X was told of this before he went out to speak.)\n\nThen Brother Benjamin X's half-hour was up, and the young lady and Malcolm X, alone back there in the anteroom, could hear him entering the introduction: \"And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you, a man who would give his life for you -- I want you to hear, listen, to understand -- one who is a trojan for the black man!\"\n\nApplause rose from the audience; at the anteroom door, Malcolm X turned and looked back at his young lady assistant. \"You'll have to forgive me for raising my voice to you -- I'm just about at my wit's end.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't mention it!\" she said quickly, \"I understand.\"\n\nHis voice sounded far away, \"I wonder if anybody really understands -- \" And he walked out onto the stage, into the applause, smiling and nodding at Brother Benjamin X who passed him en route to the anteroom.\n\nThe young lady had picked up some paperwork she had to do when Benjamin X came in, perspiring. She patted his hand, saying, \"That was good!\" Through the anteroom door, just ajar, she and Benjamin X heard the applause diminishing, then the familiar ringing greeting, \"Asalaikum, brothers and sisters!\"\n\n\"Asalaikum salaam!\" some in the audience responded.\n\nAbout eight rows of seats from the front, then, a disturbance occurred. In a sudden scuffling, a man's voice was raised angrily, \"Take your hand out of my pocket!\" The entire audience was swiveling to look. \"Hold it! Hold it! Don't get excited,\" Malcolm X said crisply, \"Let's cool it, brothers -- \"\n\nWith his own attention distracted, it is possible that he never saw the gunmen. One woman who was seated near the front says. \"The commotion back there diverted me just for an instant, then I turned back to look at Malcolm X just in time to see at least three men in the front row stand and take aim and start firing simultaneously. It looked like a firing squad.\" Numerous persons later said they saw two men rushing toward the stage, one with a shotgun, the other with two revolvers. Said U.P.I. reporter Stanley Scott: \"Shots rang out. Men, women and children ran for cover. They stretched out on the floor and ducked under tables.\" Radio Station WMCA reporter Hugh Simpson said, \"Then I heard this muffled sound, I saw Malcolm hit with his hands still raised, then he fell back over the chairs behind him. Everybody was shouting. I saw one man firing a gun from under his coat behind me as I hit it [the floor], too. He was firing like he was in some Western, running backward toward the door and firing at the same time.\"\n\nThe young lady who was in the backstage anteroom told me, \"It sounded like an army had taken over. Somehow, I knew. I wouldn't go and look. I wanted to remember him as he was.\"\n\nMalcolm X's hand flew to his chest as the first of sixteen shotgun pellets or revolver slugs hit him. Then the other hand flew up. The middle finger of the left hand was bullet-shattered, and blood gushed from his goatee. He clutched his chest. His big body suddenly fell back stiffly, knocking over two chairs; his head struck the stage floor with a thud.\n\nIn the bedlam of shouting, screaming, running people, some ran toward the stage. Among them Sister Betty scrambled up from where she had thrown her body over her children, who were shrieking; she ran crying hysterically, \"My husband! They're killing my husband!\" An unidentified photographer snapped shots of Malcolm X supine on the stage floor with people bent over him snatching apart his bloody shirt, loosening his tie, trying to give him mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration, first a woman, then a man. Said the woman, who identified herself only as a registered nurse, \"I don't know how I got up on the stage, but I threw myself down on who I thought was Malcolm -- but it wasn't. I was willing to die for the man, I would have taken the bullets myself; then I saw Malcolm, and the firing had stopped, and I tried to give him artificial respiration.\" Then Sister Betty came through the people, herself a nurse, and people recognizing her moved back; she fell on her knees looking down on his bare, bullet-pocked chest, sobbing, \"They killed him!\"\n\nPatrolman Thomas Hoy, 22, was stationed outside the Audubon Ballroom entrance. \"I heard the shooting and the place exploded.\"\n\nHe rushed inside, he saw Malcolm X lying on the stage, and then some people chasing a man. Patrolman Hoy \"grabbed the suspect.\"\n\nLouis Michaux, the owner of the Nationalist Memorial Bookstore at 125th Street and Seventh Avenue in Harlem, said, \"I was arriving late at the meeting where Malcolm X had invited me, I met a large number of people rushing out.\"\n\nSergeant Alvin Aronoff and Patrolman Louis Angelos happened to be cruising by in their radio car when they heard shots. \"When we got there,\" said Aronoff, \"the crowds were pushing out and screaming `Malcolm's been shot!' and `Get 'im, get 'im, don't let him go!'\" The two policemen grabbed by the arms a Negro who was being kicked as he tried to escape. Firing a warning shot into the air, the policemen pushed the man into their police car, not wanting the angry crowd to close in, and drove him quickly to the police station.\n\nSomeone had run up to the Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital's Vanderbilt Clinic emergency entrance at 167th Street and grabbed a poles-and-canvas stretcher and brought it back to the Audubon Ballroom stage. Malcolm X was put on the stretcher and an unidentified photographer got a macabre picture of him, with his mouth open and his teeth bared, as men rushed him up to the hospital clinic emergency entrance. A hospital spokesman said later that it was about 3:15 P.M. when Malcolm X reached a third-floor operating room. He was \"either dead, or in a death-appearing state,\" said the spokesman.\n\nA team of surgeons cut through his chest to attempt to massage the heart. The effort was abandoned at 3:30 P.M.\n\nReporters who had descended upon the hospital office fired questions at the spokesman, who kept saying brusquely, \"I don't know.\" Then he took the elevator upstairs to the emergency operating room. A small crowd of friends and Sister Betty had also pushed into the hospital office when the hospital spokesman returned. Collecting himself, he made an announcement: \"The gentleman you know as Malcolm X is dead. He died from gunshot wounds. He was apparently dead before he got here. He was shot in the chest several times, and once in the cheek.\"\n\nThe group filed out of the hospital office. The Negro men were visibly fighting their emotions; one kept smashing his fist into the other cupped palm. Among the women, many were openly crying.\n\nMoments after the news flashed throughout Harlem (and throughout the entire world), a crowd began to gather outside the Hotel Theresa where Malcolm X's OAAU had its headquarters. They learned over transistor radios that the man whom the two policemen had taken from the murder scene initially identified himself as Thomas Hagan, 22 (he was later identified as Talmadge Hayer), in whose right trousers pocket the policemen had found a .45 caliber cartridge clip containing four unused cartridges, and then at Jewish Memorial Hospital doctors had reported that Hayer had been shot in the left thigh, his forehead was bruised and his body was beaten. \"If we hadn't gotten him away, they would have kicked him to death,\" Sergeant Aronoff had said, and Hayer had been taken to the Bellevue Hospital Prison Ward.\n\nBy five P.M., the crowd in front of the Theresa Hotel had been quietly, carefully dispersed, and the Black Muslim Mosque Number 7 and its restaurant around the corner, at 116th Street and Lenox Avenue, had been ordered closed as a precautionary measure, on the orders of the local 28th Precinct's Captain Lloyd Sealy. New York City's first Negro to command a precinct. When reporters telephoned the Black Muslim restaurant, a man's voice stated, \"No one is available to make any statement.\" When the OAAU office in the Theresa Hotel was tried, the telephone kept ringing, unanswered. Precinct Captain Sealy soon appeared, walking by himself along 125th Street, swinging his nightstick and conversing with people he met.\n\nAt the 28th Precinct station house on West 123rd Street, the forty policemen who were to have gone off duty at four P.M. had been told they must remain on duty, and two full busloads of the highly trained New York City Police Tactical Patrol Force had arrived at the precinct. Various high police officials made press statements. A Tactical Patrol Force Captain, Harry Kaiser, said no unusual occurrences had been noted, and he anticipated no trouble. Deputy Police Commissioner Walter Arm said that hundreds\" of extra policemen would be put into the Harlem area, including some members of the Bureau of Special Services. An Assistant Chief Inspector, Harry Taylor, speculated that the assassins had not rushed from the ballroom among the crowd, but had kept running past the stage and escaped on 165th Street. In the early evening, the police department's Chief of Detectives Philip J. Walsh quit a vacation he was on to join the hunt for the killers, and he said he looked forward to \"a long-drawn-out investigation.\" Police and reporters at the shooting scene had pictures taken of the stage, with white chalk marks now circling five bullet holes in the speaker's stand; there were other holes in the stage's mural backdrop, indicating slugs or shotgun pellets which had either missed Malcolm X or passed through him. Police declined to discuss a rumor sweeping Harlem that they had some motion pictures which had been taken in the Audubon Ballroom as the murder took place. Another rumor that gained swift momentum was that when Sister Betty had leaned over her husband's body, she had removed from his coat pocket a paper on which he had written the names of those he had supposedly learned were assigned to execute him.\n\nDeputy Police Commissioner Walter Arm stressed that the department had made efforts to protect Malcolm X. Twenty different times the department had offered protection to Malcolm X or to some of his assistants, and the protection was refused, said Commissioner Arm, and seventeen times uniformed police guards had been offered for the OAAU meetings at the Audubon Ballroom, the most recent time being \"last Sunday.\" Asked about the pistol permit that Malcolm X had said publicly he planned to request, Commissioner Arm said that as far as he knew, Malcolm X had never actually filed a request.\n\nA number of questions have been raised. The \"suspect\" arrested by Patrolman Hoy as he was being chased from the meeting has, at present writing, not been identified publicly. Deputy Police Commissioner Walter Arm's statement that Malcolm X refused police protection conflicts directly with the statements of many of his associates that during the week preceding his assassination Malcolm X complained repeatedly that the police would not take his requests for protection seriously. Finally, although police sources said that a special detail of twenty men had been assigned to the meeting and that it had even been attended by agents of the Bureau of Special Services, these men were nowhere in evidence during or after the assassination, and Talmadge Hayer, rescued from the crowd and arrested as a suspect immediately after the assassination, was picked up by two patrolmen in a squad car cruising by.\n\nOn long-distance telephones, reporters reached the Chicago mansion headquarters of Elijah Muhammad. He would not come to the telephone, but a spokesman of his said that Muhammad \"has no comment today, but he might have something to say tomorrow.\" No statement could be obtained either from Malcolm X's oldest brother, Wilfred X, the Black Muslim minister of Mosque Number 1 in Detroit. At his home, a woman told reporters that Minister Wilfred X was not there, that he had not gone to New York, and she didn't believe he had any plans to do so. (Minister Wilfred X, reached later, said that he anticipated attending the Black Muslim convention in Chicago on the following Sunday, and regarding his brother, \"My brother is dead and there is nothing we can do to bring him back.\")\n\nAs dark fell, many Negro men and women assembled before Louis Michaux's bookstore, where most of Harlem's Black Nationalist public activity centered. A small group of OAAU members opened their Hotel Theresa headquarters and sat in the room and would not make any statements to reporters.\n\nThe New York Daily News came onto the newsstands with its cover page devoted to \"Malcolm X Murdered\" over the photograph of him being borne away on the stretcher, and a subcaption, \"Gunned Down at Rally.\" In Long Island, where she had been taken just after her father's murder, six-year-old Attallah carefully wrote a letter to him, \"Dear Daddy, I love you so. O dear, O dear, I wish you wasn't dead.\"\n\n\nThe body -- still listed as \"John Doe\" because it had not yet been formally identified -- had been moved late Sunday to the New York City Medical Examiner's office at 520 First Avenue. The autopsy confirmed that shotgun pellet wounds in the heart had killed Malcolm X. Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Milton Helpern said that death followed the first sawed-off shotgun blast which caused thirteen wounds in the heart and chest, and he said that .38 and .45 caliber bullet wounds in the thighs and legs evidenced that Malcolm X had been shot at after he had fallen.\n\nMonday morning the official identification was made at the Medical Examiner's office by Sister Betty, who was accompanied by Percy Sutton, Malcolm X's Boston half-sister Mrs. Ella Collins, and Joseph E. Hall, General Manager of the large Unity Funeral Home in Harlem. Leaving the Medical Examiner's office at about noon to go and complete funeral arrangements, Sister Betty told reporters, \"No one believed what he said. They never took him seriously, even after the bombing of our home they said he did it himself!\"\n\nAt the Unity Funeral Home on the east side of Eighth Avenue between 126th and 127th streets, Sister Betty chose a six-foot-nine-inch bronze casket lined with egg-shell velvet. At her request, the funeral would be delayed until the following Saturday, five days away. The funeral home's manager Hall announced to the press that the body would be dressed in a business suit, and it would be put on view under a glass shield from Tuesday through Friday, then the Saturday services would be at a Harlem church.\n\nSoon posted on the funeral home's directory was \"El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz.\" In Brooklyn, orthodox Moslem Sheik Al-Hajh Daoud Ahmed Faisal of the Islamic Mission of America said that the delayed funeral services violated a Moslem practice that the sun should not set twice on a believer's body, that the Koran prescribed burial inside twenty-four hours if possible, and Moslems believed that when a body grows cold the soul leaves it and when the body is put into the earth it comes alive again.\n\nIn Chicago, where policemen were watching all bus depots, railways, terminals, O'Hare Airport and highway entrances, Elijah Muhammad, under heavy guard in his three-story mansion, said, \"Malcolm died according to his preaching. He seems to have taken weapons as his god. Therefore, we couldn't tolerate a man like that. He preached war. We preach peace. We are permitted to fight if we are attacked -- that's the Scripture, the Koran, and the Bible, too. But we will never be the aggressor. I don't have the right to be frightened, because I was chosen by Allah. If Allah gives me up to the hands of the wicked, I am satisfied. My life is in the hands of Allah.\" The grounds outside the mansion were patrolled by both Chicago police and Fruit of Islam bodyguards. More of both patrolled before the University of Islam high school, and the offices of the newspaper Muhammad Speaks.\n\nMalcolm X's lawyer, Assemblyman Percy Sutton, said that the police now had the names of those whom Malcolm X had said planned to kill him. All over Harlem, reporters were interviewing people, and microphones were being put before the mouths of the man-in-the-street. At police precinct station houses, people being questioned were leaving by side entrances. Said Assistant Chief Inspector Joseph Coyle, in charge of Manhattan North detectives, \". . . . a well-planned conspiracy. We're doing a screening process of the four hundred people who were in the hall at the time.\" Fifty detectives were on the case, he said, and he had been in touch with police in other cities.\n\nHarlem was mostly asleep when around the Black Muslim Mosque Number 7, on the top floor of a four-story building at 116th Street and Lenox Avenue, an explosive sound at 2:15 A.M. ripped the night. Firemen were instantly summoned by the four policemen who had been guarding the sidewalk entrance to the mosque. Within a few minutes flames burst through the building's roof and leaped thirty feet into the air. For the next seven hours firemen would pour water into the building. On an adjacent roof they found an empty five-gallon gasoline can, a brown, gasoline-stained shopping bag, and oily rags. Southbound IRT subway service was re-routed for a while, also three bus lines. At the spectacular five-alarm fire's height, a wall of the building collapsed; it smashed two fire engines at the curb and injured five firemen, one seriously, and also a pedestrian who had been across the street buying a newspaper. By daybreak, when the fire was declared \"under control,\" the Black Muslim mosque and the Gethsemane Church of God in Christ on the floor beneath it were gutted, and seven street-level stores, including the Black Muslim restaurant, were \"total losses.\" Fire Department sources said that replacing the ruined equipment would cost \"around $50,000.\" Joseph X of the Black Muslims, who once had been the immediate assistant of Malcolm X, said that Elijah Muhammad's followers had two alternative mosques to meet in, one in Brooklyn and the other in Queens, Long Island. Both these mosques were under continuous police guard.\n\nAcross the nation in San Francisco on Tuesday afternoon two policemen discovered a fire beginning in the San Francisco Black Muslim Mosque, and quickly extinguished it. Kerosene had been splashed on the sidewalk and door and set afire.\n\nThe body of El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz originally had been scheduled to go on public view at 2:30 P.M. Tuesday. Crowds stood in line behind police barricades waiting to be admitted and the policemen wherever one looked included numerous patrol cars and even sharpshooters on the roofs around the Unity Funeral Home. But the telephoned bomb threats which had begun shortly after noon made necessary two evacuations of the funeral home for bomb-squad searches, which proved futile. A search was conducted even in the 43rd Street offices of the New York Times after a man telephoned complaining of an editorial about Malcolm X and said, \"Your plant will be destroyed at four o'clock.\"\n\nAt the funeral home in Harlem, policemen inspected all packages and floral pieces being delivered, as well as the large handbags of women mourners. It was 6:15 P.M. when a cordon of policemen arrived flanking Sister Betty and four close relatives and friends who entered the funeral home in a glare of flashbulbs. \"She's a black Jacqueline Kennedy,\" observed a white reporter. \"She has class, she knows what to do and when, she handles herself beautifully.\"\n\nIt was 7:10 P.M. when the family party emerged and left. After ten minutes, the first of the waiting public was admitted. Between then and an hour before midnight, two thousand people, including scores of whites, had filed past the open coffin in which the body lay dressed in a dark business suit, a white shirt and dark tie, with a small, oblong brass plate above it inscribed, \"El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz -- May 19, 1925 -- Feb. 21, 1965.\"\n\n\nMalcolm X followers had been canvassing with growing anxiety for a Harlem church that would accept the Saturday funeral. Officials of several churches had refused, including a spokesman for the community's largest church, Abyssinian Baptist, of which Congressman-Reverend Adam Clayton Powell is the pastor; others which turned down requests, according to the Amsterdam News, included the Williams C.M.E. Church and The Refuge Temple of The Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ. Then the funeral was accepted by Bishop Alvin A. Childs for the Faith Temple, Church of God in Christ located at 147th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. The Faith Temple, a former movie theater which had been converted fifteen years previously, could seat a thousand in its auditorium and another seven hundred in its basement. Bishop Childs, who in 1964 had been elected as Harlem's \"locality mayor,\" told the press that it was \"as a humanitarian gesture\" that he made his church available, and of Malcolm X, he said, \". . . a militant and vocal person. I did not agree with all of his philosophy, but this did not affect our friendship.\" Shortly after the news became known, Bishop Childs and his wife began to receive the first of a succession of bomb threats telephoned both to the church and to their home.\n\nProminent Negro figures were being quoted by the various press media. The famed psychologist Dr. Kenneth B. Clark told Jet magazine, \"I had a deep respect for this man. I believe that he was sincerely groping to find a place in the fight for Civil Rights, on a level where he would be respected and understood fully. I looked forward to his growth along those lines. It doesn't matter so much about his past. It is tragic that he was cut down at the point when he seemed on the verge of achieving the position of respectability he sought.\" A New York Times correspondent in a London press conference quoted the author and dramatist James Baldwin, who thought the death of Malcolm X was \"a major setback for the Negro movement.\" Pointing at white reporters, Baldwin accused, \"You did it . . . whoever did it was formed in the crucible of the Western world, of the American Republic!\" European \"rape\" of Africa began racial problems and was therefore the beginning of the end for Malcolm X, Baldwin said.\n\nThe bookstore owner in Harlem, Louis Michaux, a major voice in the community, told the Amsterdam News, \"It's things like the murder of Malcolm X that drive the masses closer together. He died in the same manner that Patrice Lumumba met his death in the Congo. . . . We must unite, not fight.\"\n\n\"Malcolm X caused many young Negroes to take a new vision of themselves,\" said Bayard Rustin, a main figure in organizing the March on Washington in 1963. A \"third party\" was suspected of killing Malcolm X by CORE's National Director James Farmer, who said, \"Malcolm's murder was calculated to produce more violence and murder and vengeance killings.\" A few days later, asked for his opinion of a rumor circulating about that a \"Red Chinese\" plot brought about the murder, Farmer said, \"I would not say it is impossible.\"\n\n\"For the Negroes in America, the death of Malcolm X is the most portentous event since the deportation of Marcus Garvey in the 1920's,\" said Dr. C. Eric Lincoln, author of The Black Muslims in America, who talked to the press at Brown University in Providence, R.I., where he was a visiting professor and research fellow. \"I doubt there are `international implications' in the slaying. The answer is closer to home. The answer is in the local struggle among contending rivals for leadership of the black masses, which are potentially the most volatile sub-group in America.\" Said Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, \"Master spellbinder that he was, Malcolm X in death cast a spell more far-flung and more disturbing than any he cast in life.\"\n\nThe New York City police investigators who were pursuing the case were unhappy that Malcolm's followers had \"not come forward\" to aid the investigation. At police request, the press printed a telephone number, SW 5-8117, for \"strictly confidential\" information that anyone might offer concerning the slaying. The police had picked up and were holding Reuben Francis, described as a Malcolm X \"bodyguard,\" who was believed to be the person who had shot the suspected assassin Talmadge Hayer during the melee the previous Sunday at the Audubon Ballroom. Hayer remained in the Bellevue Prison Ward, awaiting surgery.\n\nAs thousands continued viewing the body of the slain Malcolm X amid intermittent new bomb threats telephoned to the funeral home, and to the Faith Temple where his funeral was scheduled for Saturday, a new organization, the Federation of Independent Political Action, threatened to picket all Harlem business establishments which would not close from Thursday afternoon until Monday morning \"in tribute to Malcolm X.\" The FIPA's spokesman was Jesse Gray, the well-known rent-strike leader; Harlem pedestrians began to be handed printed sheets reading, in part, \"If the stores refuse to close, they identify with our enemy -- therefore we must close them -- pass them by. Those that shop along 125th Street during the hours that the stores are to be closed identify with the murderous stooge that allowed the power structure to use his hands to kill Brother Malcolm.\" At a late evening FIPA rally before Louis Michaux's bookstore, Jesse Gray declared that in 1965 a Negro should run for Mayor of New York \"in the name of Malcolm,\" and speculated that such a candidate should receive 100,000 votes. Shortly after the FIPA rally, merchants and other members of the Uptown Chamber of Commerce met and swiftly passed a resolution urging all Harlem stores to remain open and \"continue to serve their customers,\" and recommendation was made that full pay be given to any store employees who might wish to attend Malcolm X's funeral on Saturday morning. Then one after another, Harlem leaders sharply criticized the FIPA proposal as \"irresponsible.\" Finally, nearly all of the Harlem stores kept their doors open for business. The FIPA got together about twenty pickets who patrolled for a while before Harlem's largest store, Blumstein's; leading the pickets were two white men carrying signs reading \"All Stores Should Close. Honor Malcolm X.\"\n\nThe weather had turned very cold. Icicles hung from the collapsed roof of the fire-ruined building that had housed Black Muslim Mosque Number 7. The Amsterdam News, its offices barely a block down Eighth Avenue from the funeral home where Malcolm X's body lay, editorialized, \"Steady, Eddie!\" saying that orderly tributes to Malcolm X would \"confound his critics, who would like nothing better than to see black people rioting over his remains.\"\n\nThe fear of serious mass rioting set off by some unpredictable spark hung steadily in the air. An increasing number of Harlem leaders declared that the principal reason for this was the downtown white press media, sensationalizing what was going on in a calm, dignified community. Finally the Harlem Ministers' Interfaith Association would issue a formal accusation: \"The screaming headlines of many of our newspapers make it seem as if all of Harlem was an armed camp, ready to explode at any moment. The vast majority of the citizens of the Harlem community is not involved in the unfortunate acts of violence that have been grossly overplayed by the press. Many times the slanting of the news is able to bring about an atmosphere through which a few depraved and reckless individuals can take advantage.\"\n\n\"Malcolm X Died Broke\" -- that headline in Harlem's Amsterdam News came as a shock to many in the community. Few had reflected that Malcolm X, upon becoming a Black Muslim minister, had signed an oath of poverty, so that for twelve years he never acquired anything in his own name. (Somewhere I have read that Malcolm X in his Black Muslim days received about $175 weekly to cover his living and other expenses exclusive of travel.) \"He left his four daughters and pregnant wife with no insurance of any kind, no savings, and no income,\" the Amsterdam News story said (and it might have added that he never drew up a will; he had made a February 26th appointment with his lawyer -- five days after his death). Within the week, two groups had organized and were asking Harlemites for contributions to help Sister Betty raise and educate the children (since organized as the Malcolm X Daughters' Fund at Harlem's Freedom National Bank, 275 West 125th Street).\n\nIn Boston, Malcolm X's half-sister, Mrs. Ella Mae Collins, told a news conference that she would choose the leaders of the OAAU to succeed Malcolm X. Mrs. Collins operated the Sarah A. Little School of Preparatory Arts where, she said, children were taught Arabic, Swahili, French, and Spanish. In 1959, she, too, had broken away from Elijah Muhammad's Black Muslims, to which she had originally been converted by Malcolm X.\n\nFar from Harlem, in lands where Malcolm X had traveled, the press had given the murder a coverage that had highly irritated the Director of the United States Information Agency, Carl T. Rowan, himself a Negro. In Washington, addressing the American Foreign Service Association, Rowan said that when he first heard of the murder, he knew it would be grossly misconstrued in some countries where people were unaware what Malcolm X represented, and he said the USIA had worked hard to inform the African press of the facts about Malcolm X and his preachments, but still there had been \"a host of African reaction based on misinformation and misrepresentation.\"\n\nSaid USIA Director Rowan, \"Mind you, here was a Negro who preached segregation and race hatred, killed by another Negro, presumably from another organization that preaches segregation and race hatred, and neither of them representative of more than a tiny minority of the Negro population of America -- \" Rowan held up some foreign newspapers. \"All this about an exconvict, ex-dope peddler who became a racial fanatic,\" continued Rowan. \"I can only conclude that we Americans know less about what goes on in the minds of other peoples than we thought, or the need to inform is even greater than we in USIA thought it to be.\"\n\nThe Daily Times of Lagos, in Nigeria, had said: \"Like all mortals, Malcolm X was not without his faults . . . but that he was a dedicated and consistent disciple of the movement for the emancipation of his brethren, no one can doubt . . . Malcolm X has fought and died for what he believed to be right. He will have a place in the palace of martyrs.\" The Ghanaian Times, Accra, called Malcolm X \"the militant and most popular of Afro-American anti-segregationist leaders\" and it added his name to \"a host of Africans and Americans\" ranging from John Brown to Patrice Lumumba \"who were martyred in freedom's cause.\" Also in Accra, the Daily Graphic: \"The assassination of Malcolm X will go down in history as the greatest blow the American integrationist movement has suffered since the shocking assassinations of Medgar Evers and John F. Kennedy.\"\n\nThe Pakistan Hurriyet of Karachi said: \"A great Negro leader\"; the Pakistan Times said, \"His death is a definite setback to the Negro movement for emancipation.\" The Peking, China People's Daily said the killing happened \"because Malcolm X . . . fought for the emancipation of the 23,000,000 American Negroes.\" According to correspondents' reports, the first Algerian headline said \"the Ku Klux Klan\" assassinated Malcolm X; the pro-Communist Alger Republican's editorial on the slaying accused \"American Fascism,\" and the Times' Algerian correspondent said Algerians showed \"signs\" of raising Malcolm X to martyrdom. The U.S. Consulate in Georgetown, British Guiana, was marched on by pickets accusing \"American imperialists.\" Another Peking, China paper, Jenmin Jihpao, said that the death showed that \"in dealing with imperialist oppressors, violence must be met with violence.\" Pravda in Moscow carried only brief stories and no editorial comment, the New York Times Moscow correspondent said, and another in Poland said there was no noticeable reaction of any kind, and that \"few Poles had heard of Malcolm or were interested in the racial issue.\" Reportedly, the murder was only routinely reported with little special interest by the press in Cairo, Beirut, New Delhi, and Saigon. In Paris and Western Europe, the story was \"essentially a one-day sensation,\" with the West German press handling it \"as if it were in the Chicago gangster tradition.\" The New York Times said: \"The London newspapers have probably played the story harder and longer than most, giving continuing emphasis to the police work on the murder. The London Times and the London Daily Telegraph both carried editorial comments, but neither treated Malcolm X as a major figure.\" Also reported by the New York Times London correspondent was that \"a London group calling itself the Council of African Organizations had violently attacked the United States over the murder. This group is made up of students and other unofficial African representatives here. A press release described Malcolm as a `leader in the struggle against American imperialism, oppression and racialism.' It said, `the butchers of Patrice Lumumba are the very same monsters who have murdered Malcolm X in cold blood.'\"\n\nFriday morning New York City press headlines concerning Malcolm X's slaying were devoted to the police department's apprehension of a second slaying suspect. He was a stocky, round-faced, twenty-six-year-old karate expert named Norman 3X Butler, allegedly a Black Muslim, and a week later, this was followed by the arrest of Thomas 15X Johnson, also allegedly a Black Muslim. Both men had been earlier indicted in the January, 1965, shooting of Benjamin Brown, a New York City Correction Officer and a Black Muslim defector. Both men were indicted, along with Hayer, for the murder of Malcolm X on March 10.\n\nWith the news announcement of Butler's arrest, and his at least tentative identification as a member of Elijah Muhammad's organization, tension reached a new high among all who had any role in the feud. The Black Muslim National Convention was scheduled to begin that Friday in Chicago, to last for three days. Early Friday morning in New York at the Kennedy Airport dozens of policemen spent forty minutes searching a plane belonging to Capital Airlines, which back in December 1964 had accepted a Mosque Number 7 charter flight to Chicago and return, at a fee of $5,175.54 which the mosque had subsequently paid in increments.\n\nAltogether, about three thousand Black Muslims from their mosques in most sizable cities were in Chicago for their annual \"Saviour's Day\" convention, regarded by them as similar to the holiday of Christmas. In the order of arrival, each group from the different mosques and cities assembled outside the big sports coliseum south of Chicago's business district, the brothers of all ages dressed in neat, dark suits and white shirts and the sisters garbed in flowing silk gowns and headdresses -- and every individual was filtered through an intense security check that Chicago police sources said was unprecedented in Chicago except for a visiting President.\n\nSearched even more closely were the relatively few non-Muslim Negroes who came to be spectators, and the press representatives both white and black. \"Take off your hat, show some respect!\" snapped a Black Muslim guard at a white reporter. As each person was \"cleared\" a Fruit of Islam man ushered him or her to a specific seat in the drafty interior of the 7500-seat coliseum. (Later, Muslim sources would blame the half-full house upon \"the white man's dividing of Negroes,\" but observers who recalled the packed coliseum in 1964 said that bombing fears kept away many non-Muslim Negroes.) The audience sat lightly murmuring under the two huge hanging banners proclaiming \"Welcome Elijah Muhammad -- We Are Glad To Have You With Us\" and \"We Must Have Some Of This Land\" (referring to Elijah Muhammad's demand that \"one or more states\" be turned over to the \"23 million so-called Negroes\" in America as partial reparation for \"over a century of our free blood and sweat as slaves which helped to develop this wealthy nation where still today you show us you do not wish or intend to accept us as equals\"). In front of the wide, raised speaker's platform were two nearly life-sized photographic blowups of Elijah Muhammad. Standing between the stage and the audience were Fruit of Islam guards. Others were prowling the aisles, scanning rows of faces, with intermittent peremptory demands for identification, \"What mosque, brother?\" Still more Fruit of Islam men were inspecting the coliseum's vacant balcony, backstage, downstairs, and rafters and roof.\n\nThe ghost of Malcolm X was in the coliseum. First, in a high drama for the Muslims, Elijah Muhammad's son, Wallace Delaney Muhammad, who once had sided with Malcolm X, faced the audience and begged forgiveness for his defection. Next, two brothers of Malcolm X, Wilfred and Philbert, both of them Black Muslim ministers, urged unity with Elijah Muhammad. Said Minister Wilfred X of the Detroit mosque, \"We would be ignorant to get confused and go to arguing and fighting among ourselves and forget who the real enemy is.\" Said Minister Philbert X, of the Lansing mosque, \"Malcolm was my own blood brother, next to me . . . I was shocked. No man wants to see his own brother destroyed. But I knew that he was traveling on a very reckless and dangerous road. I made attempts to change his course. When he was living, I tried to keep him living; now that he is dead, there is nothing I can do.\" Indicating the seated Elijah Muhammad, Minister Philbert X declared, \"Where he leads me, I will follow\" -- and then he introduced the Black Muslim leader to make his address.\n\nOnly the head of Elijah Muhammad was visible above the grim-faced Fruit of Islam men in a living wall, Cassius Clay among them. Crescents, stars, moons and suns were in gold thread embroidery on the small fez that Elijah Muhammad wore. He said in his speech: \"For a long time, Malcolm stood here where I stand. In those days, Malcolm was safe, Malcolm was loved. God, Himself, protected Malcolm. . . . For more than a year, Malcolm was given his freedom. He went everywhere -- Asia, Europe, Africa, even to Mecca, trying to make enemies for me. He came back preaching that we should not hate the enemy. . . . He came here a few weeks ago to blast away his hate and mudslinging; everything he could think of to disgrace me. . . . We didn't want to kill Malcolm and didn't try to kill him. They know I didn't harm Malcolm. They know I loved him. His foolish teaching brought him to his own end. . . . \"\n\nBoth physically and emotionally worked up, often Elijah Muhammad would begin coughing. \"Take it easy! Take your time!\" his audience pleaded with him. \"He had no right to reject me!\" Elijah Muhammad declared. \"He was a star, who went astray! . . . They knew I didn't harm Malcolm, but he tried to make war against me.\" He said that Malcolm X would have been given \"the most glorious of burials\" if he had stayed with the Black Muslims and had died a natural death; \"instead, we stand beside the grave of a hypocrite! . . . Malcolm! Who was he leading? Who was he teaching? He has no truth! We didn't want to kill Malcolm! His foolish teaching would bring him to his own end! I am not going to let the crackpots destroy the good things Allah sent to you and me!\"\n\nElijah Muhammad drove his frail energy to speak for about an hour and a half. He challenged any would-be assassins: \"If you seek to snuff out the life of Elijah Muhammad, you are inviting your own doom! The Holy Quran tells us not to pick a fight but to defend ourselves. We will fight!\" It was mid-afternoon when Elijah Muhammad turned back to his seat with some three thousand Black Muslim men, women, and children shouting \"Yes, sir! . . . So sweet! . . . All praise to Muhammad!\"\n\nIn the Unity Funeral Home in the Harlem community of New York City in the mid-afternoon, the public's viewing of the body of Malcolm X was interrupted by the arrival of a party of about a dozen people whose central figure was a white-turbaned, darkrobed elderly man whose white beard fell to his chest and who carried a forked stick. When reporters rushed to attempt interviews, another man in the party waved them away, saying, \"A silent tongue does not betray its owner.\" The man was Sheik Ahmed Hassoun, a Sudanese, a member of the Sunni Moslems, who had taught in Mecca for thirty-five years when he had met Malcolm X there, and then had soon come to the United States to serve as Malcolm X's spiritual advisor and to teach at the Muslim Mosque, Inc.\n\nSheik Hassoun prepared the body for burial in accordance with Moslem ritual. Removing the Western clothing in which the body had been on display, Sheik Hassoun washed the body with special holy oil. Then he draped the body in the traditional seven white linen shrouds, called the kafan. Only the face with its reddish mustache and goatee was left exposed. The mourners who had come with Sheik Hassoun filed to the bier and he read passages from the Koran. Then he turned to a funeral home representative: \"Now the body is ready for burial.\" Soon, the sheik and his retinue left, and the viewing by the public resumed. When the word spread, numbers of persons who had come before returned for another wait in the long, slowly moving line, wanting to see the Moslem burial dress.\n\nIt was late during this Friday afternoon that I got into the quietly moving line, thinking about the Malcolm X with whom I had worked closely for about two years. Blue-uniformed policemen stood at intervals watching us shuffle along within the wooden gray-painted police barricades. Just across the street several men were looking at the line from behind a large side window of the \"Lone Star Barber Shop, Eddie Johns, Prop., William Ashe, Mgr.\" Among the policemen were a few press representatives talking to each other to pass the time. Then we were inside the softly lit, hushed, cool, large chapel. Standing at either end of the long, handsome bronze coffin were two big, dark policemen, mostly looking straight ahead, but moving their lips when some viewer tarried. Within minutes I had reached the coffin. Under the glass lid, I glimpsed the delicate white shrouding over the chest and up like a hood about the face on which I tried to concentrate for as long as I could. All I could think was that it was he, all right -- Malcolm X. \"Move on\" -- the policeman's voice was soft. Malcolm looked to me -- just waxy and dead. The policeman's hand was gesturing at his waist level. I thought, \"Well -- good-bye.\" I moved on.\n\nTwenty-two thousand people had viewed the body when the line was stopped that night for good, at eleven P.M. Quietly, between midnight and dawn, a dozen police cars flanked a hearse that went the twenty-odd blocks farther uptown to the Faith Temple. The bronze coffin was wheeled inside and placed upon a platform draped in thick dark red velvet, in front of the altar, and the coffin's lid was reopened. As the hearse pulled away, policemen stood at posts of vigil both inside and outside Faith Temple. It was crispy cold outside.\n\nAbout six A.M., people began forming a line on the east side of Amsterdam Avenue. By nine A.M., an estimated six thousand persons thronged the nearby blocks, behind police barriers, and faces were in every window of the apartment buildings across the street; some stood shivering on fire escapes. From 145th Street to 149th Street, policemen had blocked off all automobile traffic except for their own cars, the newspapers' cars, and the equipment trucks for radio and television on-the-spot coverage. There were hundreds of policemen, some on the rooftops in the immediate area. Combing the crowd's edges were reporters with microphones and notebooks. \"He was fascinating, a remarkably fascinating man, that's why I'm here,\" a white girl in her midtwenties told a New York Times man; and a Negro woman, \"I'm paying my respects to the greatest black man in this century. He's a black man. Don't say colored.\" Another woman, noticing steel helmets inside a television network car, laughed to the driver, \"You getting ready for next summer?\"\n\nWhen the Faith Temple doors were opened at 9:20, a corps of OAAU members entered. Within the next quarter-hour, twenty of the men had ushered in six hundred seat-holders. Fifty press reporters, photographers and television cameramen clustered beneath religious murals to the rear of the altar, and some stood on chairs to see better. A Negro engineer monitored recording equipment between the altar and the coffin which was guarded by eight uniformed Negro policemen and two uniformed Negro policewomen. One Negro plainclothes policeman sat on either side of heavily veiled Sister Betty in the second row. The raised lid of the coffin hid the Faith Temple's brass tithe box and candelabra; the head of the Islamic Mission of America, in Brooklyn, Sheik Al-Haj Daoud Ahmed Faisal, had counseled that any hint of Christianity in the services would make the deceased a kafir, an unbeliever. (The sheik had also dissented with the days of public exhibition of the body: \"Death is a private matter between Allah and the deceased.\")\n\nBefore the services began, OAAU ushers brought in one floral wreath -- a two-by-five arrangement of the Islamic Star and Crescent in white carnations against a background of red carnations.\n\nFirst, the actor Ossie Davis and his wife, actress Ruby Dee, read the notes, telegrams and cables of condolence. They came from every major civil rights organization; from individual figures such as Dr. Martin Luther King; from organizations and governments abroad, such as The Africa-Pakistan-West-Indian Society of the London School of Economics, the Pan-African Congress of Southern Africa, the Nigerian Ambassador from Lagos, the President of the Republic of Ghana, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah: \"The death of Malcolm X shall not have been in vain.\"\n\nNext, Omar Osman stood, a representative of the Islam Center of Switzerland and the United States: \"We knew Brother Malcolm as a blood brother, particularly after his pilgrimage to Mecca last year. The highest thing that a Moslem can aspire to is to die on the battlefield and not die at his bedside --\" He paused briefly to wait out the applause from among the mourners. \"Those who die on the battlefield are not dead, but are alive!\" The applause was louder, and cries rose, \"Right! Right!\" Omar Osman then critically commented upon the remarks which USIA Director Carl Rowan had made in Washington, D.C., about the foreign press reaction to the death of the deceased. From the audience then hisses rose.\n\nAgain, the actor Ossie Davis stood. His deep voice delivered the eulogy to Malcolm X which was going to cause Davis subsequently to be hailed more than ever among Negroes in Harlem:\n\n\"Here -- at this final hour, in this quiet place, Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its brightest hopes -- extinguished now, and gone from us forever. . . .\n\nMany will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain -- and we will smile. . . . They will say that he is of hate -- a fanatic, a racist -- who can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle!\n\nAnd we will answer and say unto them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him: Malcolm was our manhood, our living, black manhood! This was his meaning to his people. And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves. . . . And we will know him then for what he was and is -- a Prince -- our own black shining Prince! -- who didn't hesitate to die, because he loved us so.\"\n\nBrief speeches were made by others. Then, the family, the OAAU members and other Muslims present stood and filed by the coffin to view the body for the last time. Finally, the two plainclothes policemen ushered Sister Betty to have her last sight of her husband. She leaned over, kissing the glass over him; she broke into tears. Until then almost no crying had been heard in the services, but now Sister Betty's sobs were taken up by other women.\n\nThe services had lasted a little over an hour when the three minutes of prayers said for every Muslim who is dead were recited by Alhajj Heshaam Jaaber, of Elizabeth, New Jersey. At the phrase \"Allahu Akbar\" -- \"God is most great\" -- all Muslims in the audience placed their opened hands at the sides of their faces.\n\nAn official cortege, with the hearse, of three family cars, eighteen mourners' cars, twelve police cars and six press cars -- followed by about fifty other cars -- briskly drove the eighteen miles out of Manhattan and along the New York Thruway, then off its Exit 7 to reach the Ferncliff Cemetery in Ardsley, N.Y. All along the route, Negroes placed their hats or hands over their hearts, paying their final respects. At each bridge crossing to Manhattan, police cars stood watch; the Westchester County police had stationed individual patrolmen at intervals en route to the cemetery.\n\nOver the coffin, final Moslem prayers were said by Sheik Alhajj Heshaam Jaaber. The coffin was lowered into the grave, the head facing the east, in keeping with Islamic tradition. Among the mourners, the Moslems knelt beside the grave to pray with their foreheads pressed to the earth, in the Eastern manner. When the family left the gravesite, followers of Malcolm X would not let the coffin be covered by the white gravediggers who had stood a little distance away, waiting. Instead, seven OAAU men began dropping bare handfuls of earth down on the coffin; then they were given shovels and they carried dirt to fill the grave, and then mound it.\n\nThe night fell over the earthly remains of El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, who had been called Malcolm X; who had been called Malcolm Little; who had been called \"Big Red\" and \"Satan\" and \"Homeboy\" and other names -- who had been buried as a Moslem. \"According to the Koran,\" the New York Times reported, \"the bodies of the dead remain in their graves until the last Day, the Day of Judgment. On this day of cataclysm the heavens are rent and the mountains ground to dust, the graves open and men are called to account by Allah.\n\n\"The blessed -- the godfearing, the humble, the charitable, those who have suffered and been persecuted for Allah's sake or fought in religious wars for Islam -- are summoned to the Garden of Paradise.\n\nThere, according to the teaching of Mohammed, the Prophet, they live forever by flowing streams, reclining on silken cushions, and enjoying the company of dark-eyed maidens and wives of perfect purity.\n\nThe damned -- the covetous, the evildoer, the follower of gods other than Allah -- are sent to Eternal Fire, where they are fed boiling water and molten brass. `The death from which ye flee will truly overtake you,' the Koran says. `Then will ye be sent back to the Knower of things secret and open, and He will tell you the truth of the things that ye did.'\"\n\nAfter signing the contract for this book, Malcolm X looked at me hard. \"A writer is what I want, not an interpreter.\" I tried to be a dispassionate chronicler. But he was the most electric personality I have ever met, and I still can't quite conceive him dead. It still feels to me as if he has just gone into some next chapter, to be written by historians.\n\nNew York, 1965Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1255643",

shitload of honkeys\nDemocrats are a disgrace to donkeys\nWhat's that (on your neck?) you better rep that ankh piece\nDrown your sorrows in bathtub of soda pop\nSay \"Tomorrow it'll all be alright\"\nWhen tonight, you know it's not\nNaw, i'm playin', it'll all be alright\nNo it's not.....\n\nMaybe it's cause i'm used to things not alright is why I see this\nMaybe it's cause Donald Rumsfeld once held my penis\nWar is some gay shit\nPerpetrated by true players in blue blazers bathed in the dark light of self-hatred\nI've heard a whole lotta rappers rhyme over this beat\nAnd i've heard a whole lotta rhymers rep for the street\nBut I never hear bout' the people they meet\nThey don't observe, they offer no insight\nThey can't love music, they hate themselves inside\nNever listen to nobody else\nKeepin' it real is bein' yourself\nStrong stuck to weak like a birth defect\nWe need ideas not leaders, nobody's perfect... yet!\nChomsky's too academic, emcees are homophobic\nWe taught Nazis Eugenics, brain muscles need aerobics\n\"Wait, what was that? Nazis?\nWho's 'we', not me!\nWhat's Eugenics?\"\nThe science of race\nRecently disproved whose origins trace\nTo Cali\nYeah, that hot bed of liberality\nRecently voted in a machine of Nazi municipality\nWith General Powell's son is the FCC\nMeans that you think so, but were not really free\nThe circle of life is not work all your life for the man who took your dad's life, that's called slavery!\nI'm on top of my game like a lifeguard chair\nYou don't know nothin' yet you'd like to share\nToo bad... Show and tell's ova'\nA soldier's a gofer for a lawyer in a shoulder-holster\nSeein' the truth's an emotional rollercoaster\nThis is some higher talk\nI've been going through my firewalk\nThe most recent war was I-raq\nThe next maybe Syria, but sure won't be Saudi Arabia\nBut we'll get all of its neighba's\nAnd we'll kill some babies and some ground troops\nThey'll be in the shit\nThat's not the shit meaning good, but meaning brown soup\nTo all my brothers in arms, making sick jokes\nForgive the sieves, they don't know the big hoax\nThey're cloaked in darkness like \"who turned the lights out?\"\nYour handwritten kites are censored with white out\nWe might have to fight our way out\nYou can't join a clique, you best start your own right now\nYou might also likeYeah... since 9-5 motherfuckers\n1695 mothafuckas\nPuff, I think you've said e'nuff\nIts time to shut the pu kcuf\n\nI shot ya\nI got ya open like a chakra\nScience is knowin' not just a degree for a docta'\nSuperficial distinctions make me go batty\nGangsters aren't rebels, they just imitate daddyEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/6793392", "artist_names": "Ace The Syndicate (Ft.

The sun's comin' up and the birds are out singing. I let myself into my pad. Wend myself up that spiral staircase and stretch out nice on the Chesterfield\n\nPithecanthropus Erectus already on the CD player and I just push that remote button to sublimity. And listen to the sweet sculptural rhythms of Charles Mingus. And J.R. Monterose and Jackie McLean duet on those saxophones and, the sound makes its way out the window minglin' with the traffic noises outside you know, and all of a sudden I'm overcome by a feelin' of brief mortality\n\nCause I'm gettin' on in the world, comin' up on forty-one years. Forty-one stony gray steps towards the grave, you know, the box awaits its grisly load. Now I'm gonna be food for worms\n\nAnd just like Charles Mingus wrote that beautiful piece of music 'Epitaph' for Eric Dolphy, I say, so long Eric. So long John Coltrane and Charles Mingus. So long Duke Ellington and Lester Young. So long Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald. So long Jimmy Reed. So long Muddy Waters, and so long Howlin' Wolf\n(Woke up this mornin')\n[Verse 1]\nWoke up this mornin'\nGot yourself a gun\nYour mama always said you'd be the Chosen One\nShe said, \"You're one in a million\nYou got to burn to shine\"\nBut you were born under a bad sign\nWith a blue moon in your eyes\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd you woke up this mornin'\nAnd all that love had gone\nYour Papa never told you about right and wrong\nHey but you're, but you're looking good, baby\nI believe that you're a-feelin' fine\nShame about it\nBorn under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nSo sing it now\nWoke up this mornin'\nWoke up this mornin'\n\n[Verse 3]\nI see ya, ya woke up this mornin'\nThe world turned upside down\nLord above, things ain't been the same\nSince the blues walked into town\nHey but you're, but you're, one in a million\nCause you got that shotgun shine\nShame about it\nBorn under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSo sing it now\nWoke up this mornin'\nYou got a blue moon\nGot a blue moon in your eyes\nSo sad\nGoddamn\nA god-damned shame about it\nWoke up this mornin'\nYou got a blue moon\nGot a blue moon in your eyes, yeah\n\nMister D. Wayne Love\n\n[Verse 4]\nWhen you woke up this morning everything was gone\nBy half past ten your head was going ding-dong\nRingin' like a bell from your head down to your toes\nLike some voice tryin'a tell ya there's somethin' you should know\n\n[Bridge]\nLast night you was flyin' but today you're so low\nAin't it times like these makes you wonder if you'll ever know\nThe meaning of things as they appear to the others\nWives, husbands, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers\nDon't you wish you didn't function, don't you wish you didn't think\nBeyond the next pay check and the next little drink?\nWell you do so make up your mind to go on\nCause when you woke up this mornin', everything you had was gone\n\n[Chorus]\nWoke up this mornin'\nWhen ya woke up this mornin'\n\nWoke up this mornin'\nYa woke up this mornin'\n\nWoke up this mornin'\nYou wanna be, you wanna be the Chosen One\nYeah you know it cause, you just can't help yourself, yeah\n\nWoke up this mornin'\nWhen ya,

"artist": "Katherine Mansfield", "lyrics": "The Voyage LyricsThe Picton boat was due to leave at half-past eleven. It was a beautiful night, mild, starry, only when they got out of the cab and started to walk down the Old Wharf that jutted out into the harbour, a faint wind blowing off the water ruffled under Fenella's hat, and she put up her hand to keep it on. It was dark on the Old Wharf, very dark; the wool sheds, the cattle trucks, the cranes standing up so high, the little squat railway engine, all seemed carved out of solid darkness. Here and there on a rounded wood-pile, that was like the stalk of a huge black mushroom, there hung a lantern, but it seemed afraid to unfurl its timid, quivering light in all that blackness; it burned softly, as if for itself.\n\nFenella's father pushed on with quick, nervous strides. Beside him her grandma bustled along in her crackling black ulster; they went so fast that she had now and again to give an undignified little skip to keep up with them. As well as her luggage strapped into a neat sausage, Fenella carried clasped to her her grandma's umbrella, and the handle, which was a swan's head, kept giving her shoulder a sharp little peck as if it too wanted her to hurry . . . . Men, their caps pulled down, their collars turned [Page 169]  up, swung by; a few women all muffled scurried along; and one tiny boy, only his little black arms and legs showing out of a white woolly shawl, was jerked along angrily between his father and mother; he looked like a baby fly that had fallen into the cream.\n\nThen suddenly, so suddenly that Fenella and her grandma both leapt, there sounded from behind the largest wool shed, that had a trail of smoke hanging over it, Mia-oo-oo-O-O!\n\n\"First whistle,\" said her father briefly, and at that moment they came in sight of the Picton boat. Lying beside the dark wharf, all strung, all beaded with round golden lights, the Picton boat looked as if she was more ready to sail among stars than out into the cold sea. People pressed along the gangway. First went her grandma, then her father, then Fenella. There was a high step down on to the deck, and an old sailor in a jersey standing by gave her his dry, hard hand. They were there; they stepped out of the way of the hurrying people, and standing under a little iron stairway that led to the upper deck they began to say good-bye.\n\n\"There, mother, there's your luggage!\" said Fenella's father, giving grandma another strapped-up sausage.\n\n\"Thank you, Frank.\"\n\"And you've got your cabin tickets safe?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear.\"\n\n\"And your other tickets?\" [Page 170]\n\nGrandma felt for them inside her glove and showed him the tips.\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\nHe sounded stern, but Fenella, eagerly watching him, saw that he looked tired and sad. Mia-oo-oo-O-O! The second whistle blared just above their heads, and a voice like a cry shouted, \"Any more for the gangway?\"\n\n\"You'll give my love to father,\" Fenella saw her father's lips say. And her grandma, very agitated, answered, \"Of course I will, dear. Go now. You'll be left. Go now, Frank. Go now.\"\n\n\"It's all right, mother. I've got another three minutes.\" To her surprise Fenella saw her father take off his hat. He clasped grandma in his arms and pressed her to him. \"God bless you, mother!\" she heard him say.\n\nAnd grandma put her hand, with the black thread glove that was worn through on her ring finger, against his cheek, and she sobbed, \"God bless you, my own brave son!\"\n\nThis was so awful that Fenella quickly turned her back on them, swallowed once, twice, and frowned terribly at a little green star on a mast head. But she had to turn round again; her father was going.\n\n\"Good-bye, Fenella. Be a good girl.\" His cold, wet moustache brushed her cheek. But Fenella caught hold of the lapels of his coat.\n\n\"How long am I going to stay?\" she whispered anxiously. He wouldn't look at her. He shook [Page 171]  her off gently, and gently said, \"We'll see about that. Here! Where's your hand?\" He pressed something into her palm. \"Here's a shilling in case you should need it.\"\n\nA shilling! She must be going away for ever! \"Father!\" cried Fenella. But he was gone. He was the last off the ship. The sailors put their shoulders to the gangway. A huge coil of dark rope went flying through the air and fell \"thump\" on the wharf. A bell rang; a whistle shrilled. Silently the dark wharf began to slip, to slide, to edge away from them. Now there was a rush of water between. Fenella strained to see with all her might. \"Was that father turning round?\"\u2013or waving?\u2013or standing alone?\u2013or walking off by himself? The strip of water grew broader, darker. Now the Picton boat began to swing round steady, pointing out to sea. It was no good looking any longer. There was nothing to be seen but a few lights, the face of the town clock hanging in the air, and more lights, little patches of them, on the dark hills.\nThe freshening wind tugged at Fenella's skirts; she went back to her grandma. To her relief grandma seemed no longer sad. She had put the two sausages of luggage one on top of the other, and she was sitting on them, her hands folded, her head a little on one side. There was an intent, bright look on her face. Then Fenella saw that her lips were moving and guessed that she was praying. [Page 172]  But the old woman gave her a bright nod as if to say the prayer was nearly over. She unclasped her hands, sighed, clasped them again, bent forward, and at last gave herself a soft shake.\n\n\"And now, child,\" she said, fingering the bow of her bonnet-strings, \"I think we ought to see about our cabins. Keep close to me, and mind you don't slip.\"\n\n\"Yes, grandma!\"\n\nDark figures of men lounged against the rails. In the glow of their pipes a nose shone out, or the peak of a cap, or a pair of surprised-looking eyebrows. Fenella glanced up. High in the air, a little figure, his hands thrust in his short jacket pockets, stood staring out to sea. The ship rocked ever so little, and she thought the stars rocked too. And now a pale steward in a linen coat, holding a tray high in the palm of his hand, stepped out of a lighted doorway and skimmed past them. They went through that doorway. Carefully over the high brass-bound step on to the rubber mat and then down such a terribly steep flight of stairs that grandma had to put both feet on each step, and Fenella clutched the clammy brass rail and forgot all about the swan-necked umbrella.\n\nAt the bottom grandma stopped; Fenella was [Page 173]  rather afraid she was going to pray again. But no, it was only to get out the cabin tickets. They were in the saloon. It was glaring bright and stifling; the air smelled of paint and burnt chop-bones and indiarubber. Fenella wished her grandma would go on, but the old woman was not to be hurried. An immense basket of ham sandwiches caught her eye. She went up to them and touched the top one delicately with her finger.\n\n\"How much are the sandwiches?\" she asked.\n\n\"Tuppence!\" bawled a rude steward, slamming down a knife and fork.\n\nGrandma could hardly believe it.\n\n\"Twopence each? \" she asked.\n\n\"That's right,\" said the steward, and he winked at his companion.\n\nGrandma made a small, astonished face. Then she whispered primly to Fenella, \"What wickedness!\" And they sailed out at the further door and along a passage that had cabins on either side. Such a very nice stewardess came to meet them. She was dressed all in blue and her collar and cuffs were fastened with large brass buttons. She seemed to know grandma well.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Crane,\" said she, unlocking their washstand. \"We've got you back again. It's not often you give yourself a cabin.\"\n\n\"No,\" said grandma. \"But this time my dear son's thoughtfulness\u2013\"\n\"I hope\u2013\" began the stewardess. Then she [Page 174]  turned round and took a long, mournful look at grandma's blackness and at Fenella's black coat and skirt, black blouse, and hat with a crape rose.\n\nGrandma nodded. \"It was God's will,\" said she.\n\nThe stewardess shut her lips and, taking a deep breath, she seemd to expand.\n\n\"What I always say is,\" she said, as though it was her own discovery, \"sooner or later each of us has to go, and that's a certingty.\" She paused. \"Now, can I bring you anything, Mrs Crane? A cup of tea? I know it's no good offering you a little something to keep the cold out.\"\n\nGrandma shook her head. \"Nothing, thank you. We've got a few wine biscuits and Fenella has a very nice banana.\"\n\n\"Then I'll give you a look later on,\" said the stewardess; and she went out, shutting the door.\n\nWhat a very small cabin it was! It was like being shut up in a box with grandma. The dark round eye above the washstand gleamed at them dully. Fenella felt shy. She stood against the door, still clasping her luggage and the umbrella. Were they going to get undressed in here? Already her grandma had taken off her bonnet, and, rolling up the strings, she fixed each with a pin to the lining before she hung the bonnet up. Her white hair shone like silk; the little bun at the back was covered with a black net. Fenella hardly ever saw her grandma with her head uncovered; she looked strange. [Page 175]\n\n\"I shall put on the woollen fascinator your dear mother crocheted for me,\" said grandma, and, unstrapping the sausage, she took it out and wound it round her head; the fringe of grey bobbles danced at her eyebrows as she smiled tenderly and mournfully at Fenella. Then she undid her bodice, and something under that, and something else underneath that. Then there seemed a short, sharp tussle, and grandma flushed faintly. Snip! Snap! She had undone her stays. She breathed a sigh of relief and, sitting on the plush couch, she slowly and carefully pulled off her elastic-sided boots and stood them side by side.\n\nBy the time Fenella had taken off her coat and skirt and put on her flannel dressing-gown grandma was quite ready.\n\n\"Must I take off my boots, grandma? They're lace.\"\n\nGrandma gave them a moment's deep consideration. \"You'd feel a great deal more comfortable if you did, child,\" said she. She kissed Fenella. \"Don't forget to say your prayers. Our dear Lord is with us when we are at sea even more than when we are on dry land. And because I am an experienced traveller,\" said grandma briskly, \"I shall take the upper berth.\"\n\n\"But, grandma, how ever will you get up there?\"\n\nThree little spider-like steps were all Fenella saw. The old woman gave a small silent laugh before [Page 176]  she mounted them nimbly, and she peered over the high bunk at the astonished Fenella.\n\n\"You didn't think your grandma could do that, did you?\" said she. And as she sank back Fenella heard her light laugh again.\n\nThe hard square of brown soap would not lather and the water in the bottle was like a kind of blue jelly. How hard it was, too, to turn down those stiff sheets; you simply had to tear your way in. If everything had been different, Fenella might have got the giggles . . . . At last she was inside, and while she lay there panting, there sounded from above a long, soft whispering, as though someone was gently, gently rustling among tissue paper to find something. It was grandma saying her prayers. . . .\n\nA long time passed. Then the stewardess came in; she trod softly and leaned her hand on grandma's bunk.\n\n\"We're just entering the Straits,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"It's a fine night, but we're rather empty. We may pitch a little.\"\n\nAnd indeed at that moment the Picton Boat rose and rose and hung in the air just long enough to give a shiver before she swung down again, and there was the sound of heavy water slapping against her sides. Fenella remembered she had left the swan-necked umbrella standing up on the [Page 177]  little couch. If it fell over, would it break? But grandma remembered too, at the same time.\n\n\"I wonder if you'd mind, stewardess, laying down my umbrella,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Not at all, Mrs. Crane.\" And the stewardess, coming back to grandma, breathed, \"Your little granddaughter's in such a beautiful sleep.\"\n\n\"God be praised for that!\" said grandma.\n\n\"Poor little motherless mite!\" said the stewardess. And grandma was still telling the stewardess all about what happened when Fenella fell asleep.\n\nBut she hadn't been asleep long enough to dream before she woke up again to see something waving in the air above her head. What was it? What could it be? It was a small grey foot. Now another joined it. They seemed to be feeling about for something; there came a sigh.\n\n\"I'm awake, grandma,\" said Fenella.\n\n\"Oh, dear, am I near the ladder?\" asked grandma. \"I thought it was this end.\"\n\n\"No, grandma, it's the other. I'll put your foot on it. Are we there?\" asked Fenella.\n\n\"In the harbour,\" said grandma. \"We must get up, child. You'd better have a biscuit to steady yourself before you move.\"\n\nBut Fenella had hopped out of her bunk. The lamp was still burning, but night was over, and it was cold. Peering through that round eye she [Page 178]  could see far off some rocks. Now they were scattered over with foam; now a gull flipped by; and now there came a long piece of real land.\n\n\"It's land, grandma,\" said Fenella, wonderingly, as though they had been at sea for weeks together. She hugged herself; she stood on one leg and rubbed it with the toes of the other foot; she was trembling. Oh, it had all been so sad lately. Was it going to change? But all her grandma said was, \"Make haste, child. I should leave your nice banana for the stewardess as you haven't eaten it.\" And Fenella put on her black clothes again and a button sprang off one of her gloves and rolled to where she couldn't reach it. They went up on deck.\n\nBut if it had been cold in the cabin, on deck it was like ice. The sun was not up yet, but the stars were dim, and the cold pale sky was the same colour as the cold pale sea. On the land a white mist rose and fell. Now they could see quite plainly dark bush. Even the shapes of the umbrella ferns showed, and those strange silvery withered trees that are like skeletons . . . . Now they could see the landing-stage and some little houses, pale too, clustered together, like shells on the lid of a box. The other passengers tramped up and down, but more slowly than they had the night before, and they looked gloomy.\n\nAnd now the landing-stage came out to meet them. Slowly it swam towards the Picton boat and a man holding a coil of rope, and a cart with a small droop- [Page 179]  ing horse and another man sitting on the step, came too.\n\n\"It's Mr. Penreddy, Fenella, come for us,\" said grandma. She sounded pleased. Her white waxen cheeks were blue with cold, her chin trembled, and she had to keep wiping her eyes and her little pink nose.\n\n\"You've got my\u2013\"\n\n\"Yes, grandma.\" Fenella showed it to her.\n\nThe rope came flying through the air and \"smack\" it fell on to the deck. The gangway was lowered. Again Fenella followed her grandma on to the wharf over to the little cart, and a moment later they were bowling away. The hooves of the little horse drummed over the wooden piles, then sank softly into the sandy road. Not a soul was to be seen; there was not even a feather of smoke. The mist rose and fell and the sea still sounded asleep as slowly it turned on the beach.\n\n\"I seen Mr. Crane yestiddy,\" said Mr. Penreddy. \"He looked himself then. Missus knocked him up a batch of scones last week.\"\n\nAnd now the little horse pulled up before one of the shell-like houses. They got down. Fenella put her hand on the gate, and the big, trembling dew-drops soaked through her glove-tips. Up a little path of round white pebbles they went, with drenched sleeping flowers on either side. Grandma's delicate white picotees were so heavy with dew that they were fallen, but their sweet smell was part [Page 180]  of the cold morning. The blinds were down in the little house; they mounted the steps on to the veranda. A pair of old bluchers was on one side of the door and a large red watering-can on the other.\n\n\"Tut! tut! Your grandpa,\" said grandma. She turned the handle. Not a sound. She called, \"Walter!\" And immediately a deep voice that sounded half stifled called back, \"Is that you, Mary?\"\n\n\"Wait, dear,\" said grandma. \"Go in there.\" She pushed Fenella gently into a small dusky sitting-room.\n\nOn the table a white cat, that had been folded up like a camel, rose, stretched itself, yawned, and then sprang on to the tips of its toes. Fenella buried one cold little hand in the white, warm fur, and smiled timidly while she stroked and listened to grandma's gentle voice and the rolling tones of grandpa.\n\nA door creaked. \"Come in, dear.\" The old woman beckoned, Fenella followed. There, lying to one side on an immense bed, lay grandpa. Just his head with a white tuft and his rosy face and long silver beard showed over the quilt. He was like a very old wide-awake bird.\n\n\"Well, my girl!\" said grandpa. \"Give us a kiss!\" Fenella kissed him. \"Ugh!\" said grandpa. \"Her little nose is as cold as a button. What's that she's holding? Her grandma's umbrella?\"\n\nFenella smiled again, and crooked the swan neck over the bed-rail. Above the bed there was a big text in a deep black frame:-\n\n\"Lost! One Golden Hour Set with Sixty Diamond Minutes. No Reward Is Offered For It Is Gone For Ever!\"\n\"Yer grandma painted that,\" said grandpa. And he ruffled his white tuft and looked at Fenella so merrily she almost thought he winked at her.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1104660", "artist_names": "James Carr", "full_title": "Love Attack by\u00a0James\u00a0Carr", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c605a94485170a0c68c97cb0c9060fc3.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c605a94485170a0c68c97cb0c9060fc3.640x640x1.jpg", "id": 1104660, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429635922, "path": "/James-carr-love-attack-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/James-carr-love-attack-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1966, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1966", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1966", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c605a94485170a0c68c97cb0c9060fc3.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c605a94485170a0c68c97cb0c9060fc3.640x640x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Love Attack", "title_with_featured": "Love Attack", "updated_by_human_at": 1546634916, "url": "https://genius.com/James-carr-love-attack-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/169370", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/1dcd5981e226bd46c5a25df370c9f429.419x300x1.jpg", "id": 169370, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/1dcd5981e226bd46c5a25df370c9f429.419x300x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "James Carr", "slug": "James-carr", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/James-carr"}, "artist": "James Carr", "lyrics": "Love Attack LyricsNow here I am\nWith this pain in my heart now\nI got a sweet little woman\nTook my heart and\nShe tore it apart\n\nI tried not to show it\nBut it just ain't no use\n\nIt's just like holding on\nTo a hot rod now, baby\nI can't turn it loose now\nI just had a love attack\nLord, I just had a love attack\n\nNow my love life was nothing\nIn fact, it was a blank\nUntil you came along, ooh wee\nYou put a little tiger in my tank\n\nCan't you see you got me\nHelpless right now, baby\nLaid down on my back\n\nYou got me down, down, down\nDown, down from a love attack\n\nI've had the mumps and the measles\nLord, I had the whooping cough\nI been down with double pneumonia\nBut I was able to shake it off\n\nBut you came along and\nKnocked me flat on my back\nNow you got me suffering\nFrom a little love attack\n\nI fell for you, baby\nBaby, I fell for you\nJust like a rock now\nYou might also likeWhen you turned on your love\nI was so weak, I just\nCouldn't stand the shock now\n\nYou hit me just like lightning\nKnocked me out of my chair\nYou got me down, baby\nI'm down with a love attack\n\nCan't you see you\nGot me down right now\nDown with a love attack\n\nGot my mind messed up\nI got a love attack now\n\nI, I love you\nI love youEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/3931914", "artist_names": "Byron Henderson", "full_title": "DEEP END. by\u00a0Byron\u00a0Henderson", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/9bb701cefa5687eee5c11d29dc678c69.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9bb701cefa5687eee5c11d29dc678c69.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 3931914, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 2813841, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1569872047, "path": "/Byron-henderson-deep-end-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Byron-henderson-deep-end-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2019, "month": 9, "day": 29}, "release_date_for_display": "September 29, 2019", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Sep. 29, 2019", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/9bb701cefa5687eee5c11d29dc678c69.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9bb701cefa5687eee5c11d29dc678c69.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "DEEP END.", "title_with_featured": "DEEP END.", "updated_by_human_at": 1647614251, "url": "https://genius.com/Byron-henderson-deep-end-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/53353", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/91154692e481117a0ff28cc69898999e.1000x563x1.jpg", "id": 53353, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/42d4e327a1090747d4e393dfbefebfe7.914x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "b", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Byron Henderson", "slug": "Byron-henderson", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Byron-henderson"}, "artist": "Byron Henderson", "lyrics": "DEEP END.

might also like[Post-Hook]\nLooking for a way out\nTo lie with you, they'd lie for you\nRide for you, die for you\nWho love you like I love you?\nAll them putting morality to the side for you\nBe on that auction block when it's time for you?\nNot me\n\nI\u2019ll never hustle for a necklace\nI just want to know who\u2019s down for me when it\u2019s hectic\nDeep breath, knee to elbow, chin in chest\nGuess I\u2019m going off the deep end dawg, and I accept it\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou can judge me if you feel so inclined to\nBut don't expect a response to your lies\nAlready wasting your breath, no reason to waste mine too\nYou mention me, you've already met your demise\nYou're worried bout blue lives, you're probably sick with that swine flu\nI see so many blue faces\nYet so many blue faces on people trying to decipher whose race they\u2019ve been running\nMy trigger finger is itchy, that\u2019s a copout\nYou wonder who\u2019s racist, until they\u2019re saying cop now\nThey\u2019ll come through and Jenga your whole block\nI\u2019ll just let the pen bleed for the leeches\nAnd everyone I ever pushed away, I see in the bleachers\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s real anymore, hallucinations are creeping\nDone battling, demons had me basking in youth\nNow I\u2019m trafficking truth while your President is trafficking humans\nYou laughed when I prophesized, now he\u2019s laughing at you\nRecovery ain\u2019t what I thought, so I\u2019m asking for proof\n[Hook]\nTell me who gon ride, dawg\nWho gon ride when the well wishes run dry, dawg\nI don't have a clue as to who's really on this side\nBut relationships sink and everybody's got to die, dawg\nWhat am I to do besides tell you that your vibe's off\nRunning round chasing vanity and your desires\nAll the I don\u2019t

it\n\n[Outro]\nPeople keep telling me I\u2019ve done enough thinking bout somebody\u2019s son in New Orleans that was left hanging from the bleachers after Piedmont\nThey kept it a secret for a reason, revenge all summer sixteen, huh?\nBlack lives matter\nBut we keep it moving till we die by someone other than us, so what\u2019s a movement?...\nCause it\u2019s amusing how people of power can sway opinions, it\u2019s being proven\nHow these rappers rap about everything except what they\u2019re doing\nWhat we\u2019re going through is the same battle we\u2019re always losing\nThey put their heart into using these soon to be veterans and discard them with PTSD\nWhat are you settling for, huh?\nThe truth is such a bitter pill to swallow\nI don\u2019t care about a Grammy; I just want to see tomorrow\nI just want to see my best friend one last time...Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/852461", "artist_names": "The Righteous Brothers", "full_title": "He

Olympiad. LyricsGreat Alexander was wise Philips son,\nHe to Amyntas, Kings of Macedon;\nThe cruel proud Olympias was his Mother,\nShe to Epirus warlike King was daughter.\nThis Prince (his father by Pausanias slain)\nThe twenty first of's age began to reign.\nGreat were the Gifts of nature which he had,\nHis education much to those did adde:\nBy art and nature both he was made fit,\nTo 'complish that which long before was writ.\nThe very day of his Nativity\nTo ground was burnt Dianaes Temple high:\nAn Omen to their near approaching woe,\nWhose glory to the earth this king did throw.\nHis Rule to Greece he scorn'd should be confin'd,\nThe Universe scarce bound his proud vast mind.\nThis is the He-Goat which from Grecia came,\nThat ran in Choler on the Persian Ram,\nThat brake his horns, that threw him on the ground\nTo save him from his might no man was found:\nPhilip on this great Conquest had an eye,\nBut death did terminate those thoughts so high.\nThe Greeks had chose him Captain General,\nWhich honour to his Son did now befall.\n(For as Worlds Monarch now we speak not on,\nBut as the King of little Macedon)\nRestless both day and night his heart then was,\nHis high resolves which way to bring to pass;\nYet for a while in Greece is forc'd to stay,\nWhich makes each moment seem more then a day.\nThebes and stiff Athens both 'gainst him rebel,\nTheir mutinies by valour doth he quell.\nThis done against both right and natures Laws,\nHis kinsmen put to death, who gave no cause;\nThat no rebellion in in his absence be,\nNor making Title unto Sovereignty.\nAnd all whom he suspects or fears will climbe,\nNow taste of death least they deserv'd in time,\nNor wonder is t if he in blood begin,\nFor Cruelty was his parental sin,\nThus eased now of troubles and of fears,\nNext spring his course to Asia he steers;\nLeavs Sage Antipater, at home to sway,\nAnd through the Hellispont his Ships made way.\nComing to Land, his dart on shore he throws,\nThen with alacrity he after goes;\nAnd with a bount'ous heart and courage brave,\nHis little wealth among his Souldiers gave.\nAnd being ask'd what for himself was left,\nReply'd, enough, sith only hope he kept.\nThirty two thousand made up his Foot force,\nTo which were joyn'd five thousand goodly horse.\nThen on he marcht, in's way he view'd old Troy,\nAnd on Achilles tomb with wondrous joy\nHe offer'd, and for good success did pray\nTo him, his Mothers Ancestors, (men say)\nWhen news of Alexander came to Court,\nTo scorn at him Darius had good sport;\nSends him a frothy and contemptuous Letter,\nStiles him disloyal servant, and no better;\nReproves him for his proud audacity\nTo lift his hand 'gainst such a Monarchy.\nThen to's Lieftenant he in Asia sends\nThat he be ta'ne alive, for he intends\nTo whip him well with rods, and so to bring\nThat boy so mallipert before the King.\nAh! fond vain man, whose pen ere while\nIn lower terms was taught a higher stile.\nTo River Granick Alexander hyes\nWhich in Phrygia near Propontike lyes.\nThe Persians ready for encounter stand,\nAnd strive to keep his men from off the land;\nThose banks so steep the Greeks yet scramble up,\nAnd beat the coward Persians from the top,\nAnd twenty thousand of their lives bereave,\nWho in their backs did all their wounds receive.\nThis victory did Alexander gain,\nWith loss of thirty four of his there slain;\nThen Sardis he, and Ephesus did gain,\nVVhere stood of late, Diana's wondrous Phane,\nAnd by Parmenio (of renowned Fame,)\nMiletus and Pamphilia overcame.\nHallicarnassus and Pisidia\nHe for his Master takes with Lycia.\nNext Alexander marcht towards the black Sea,\nAnd easily takes old Gordium in his way;\nOf Ass ear'd Midas, once the Regal Seat,\nVVhose touch turn'd all to gold, yea even his meat\nVVhere the Prophetick knot he cuts in twain,\nVVhich who so doth, must Lord of all remain.\nNow news of Memnon's death (the Kings Viceroy)\nTo Alexanders heart's no little joy,\nFor in that Peer, more valour did abide,\nThen in Darius multitude beside:\nIn's stead, was Arses plac'd, but durst not stay,\nYet set one in his room, and ran away;\nHis substitute as fearfull as his master,\nRuns after two, and leaves all to Disaster.\nThen Alexander all Cilicia takes,\nNo stroke for it he struck, their hearts so quakes.\nTo Greece he thirty thousand talents sends,\nTo raise more Force to further his intends:\nThen o're he goes Darius now to meet,\nWho came with thousand thousands at his feet.\nThough some there be (perhaps) more likely write\nHe but four hundred thousand had to fight,\nThe rest Attendants, which made up no less,\nBoth Sexes there was almost numberless.\nFor this wise King had brought to see the sport,\nWith him the greatest Ladyes of the Court,\nHis mother, his beauteous Queen and daughters,\nIt seems to see the Macedonian slaughters.\nIts much beyond my time and little art,\nTo shew how great Darius plaid his part;\nThe splendor and the pomp he marched in,\nFor since the world was no such Pageant seen.\nSure 'twas a goodly sight there to behold,\nThe Persians clad in silk, and glistering gold,\nThe stately horses trapt, the lances gilt,\nAs if addrest now all to run a tilt.\nThe holy fire was borne before the host,\n(For Sun and Fire the Persians worship most)\nThe Priests in their strange habit follow after,\nAn object, not so much of fear as laughter.\nThe King sate in a chariot made of gold,\nWith crown and Robes most glorious to behold,\nAnd o're his head his golden Gods on high,\nSupport a party coloured Canopy.\nA number of spare horses next were led,\nLest he should need them in his Chariots stead;\nBut those that saw him in this state to lye,\nSuppos'd he neither meant to fight nor flye.\nHe fifteen hundred had like women drest;\nFor thus to fright the Greeks he judg'd was best.\nTheir golden ornaments how to set forth,\nWould ask more time then was their bodies worth\nGreat Sysigambis she brought up the Reer,\nThen such a world of waggons did appear,\nLike several houses moving upon wheels,\nAs if she'd drawn whole Shushan at her heels:\nThis brave Virago to the King was mother,\nAnd as much good she did as any other.\nNow lest this gold, and all this goodly stuff\nHad not been spoyle and booty rich enough\nA thousand mules and Camels ready wait\nLoaden with gold, with jewels and with plate:\nFor sure Darius thought at the first sight,\nThe Greeks would all adore, but none would fight\nBut when both Armies met, he might behold\nThat valour was more worth then pearls or gold,\nAnd that his wealth serv'd but for baits to 'lure\nTo make his overthrow more fierce and sure.\nThe Greeks came on and with a gallant grace\nLet fly their arrows in the Persians face.\nThe cowards feeling this sharp stinging charge\nMost basely ran, and left their king at large:\nWho from his golden coach is glad to 'light,\nAnd cast away his crown for swifter flight:\nOf late like some immoveable he lay,\nNow finds both legs and horse to run away.\nTwo hundred thousand men that day were slain,\nAnd forty thousand prisoners also tane,\nBesides the Queens and Ladies of the court,\nIf Curtius be true in his report.\nThe Regal Ornaments were lost, the treasure\nDivided at the Macedonians pleasure;\nYet all this grief, this loss, this overthrow,\nWas but beginning of his future woe.\nThe royal Captives brought to Alexander\nT'ward them demean'd himself like a Commander\nFor though their beauties were unparaled,\nConquer'd himself now he had conquered,\nPreserv'd their honour, us'd them bounteously,\nCommands no man should doe them injury:\nAnd this to Alexander is more fame\nThen that the Persian King he overcame.\nTwo hundred eighty Greeks he lost in fight,\nBy too much heat, not wounds (as authors write)\nNo sooner had this Victor won the field,\nBut all Phenicia to his pleasure yield,\nOf which the Goverment he doth commit\nUnto Parmenio of all most fit.\nDarius now less lofty then before,\nTo Alexander writes he would restore\nThose mournfull Ladies from Captivity,\nFor whom he offers him a ransome high:\nBut down his haughty stomach could not bring,\nTo give this Conquerour the Stile of King.\nThis Letter Alexander doth disdain,\nAnd in short terms sends this reply again,\nA King he was, and that not only so,\nBut of Darius King, as he should know.\nNext Alexander unto Tyre doth goe,\nHis valour and his victoryes they know:\nTo gain his love the Tyrians intend,\nTherefore a crown and great Provision send,\nTheir present he receives with thankfullness,\nDesires to offer unto Hercules,\nProtector of their town, by whom defended,\nAnd from whom he lineally descended.\nBut they accept not this in any wise,\nLest he intend more fraud then sacrifice,\nSent word that Hercules his temple stood\nIn the old town, (which then lay like a wood)\nWith this reply he was so deep enrag'd,\nTo win the town, his honour he ingag'd:\nAnd now as Babels King did once before,\nHe leaves not till he made the sea firm shore,\nBut far less time and cost he did expend,\nThe former Ruines forwarded his end:\nMoreover had a Navy at command,\nThe other by his men fetcht all by land.\nIn seven months time he took that wealthy town,\nWhose glory now a second time's brought down.\nTwo thousand of the chief he crucifi'd,\nEight thousand by the sword then also di'd,\nAnd thirteen thousand Gally slaves he made,\nAnd thus the Tyrians for mistrust were paid.\nThe rule of this he to Philotas gave\nWho was the son of that Parmenio brave.\nCilicia to Socrates doth give,\nFor now's the time Captains like Kings may live.\nZidon he on Ephestion bestowes;\n(For that which freely comes, as freely goes)\nHe scorns to have one worse then had the other,\nSo gives his little Lordship to another.\nEphestion having chief command of th'Fleet,\nAt Gaza now must Alexander meet.\nDarius finding troubles still increase,\nBy his Ambassadors now sues for peace,\nAnd layes before great Alexanders eyes\nThe dangers difficultyes like to rise,\nFirst at Euphrates what he's like to 'bide,\nAnd then at Tygris and Araxis side,\nThese he may scape, and if he so desire,\nA league of friendship make firm and entire.\nHis eldest daughter he in mariage profers,\nAnd a most princely dowry with her offers.\nAll those rich Kingdomes large that do abide\nBetwixt the Hellespont and Halys side.\nBut he with scorn his courtesie rejects,\nAnd the distressed King no whit respects,\nTells him, these proffers great, in truth were none\nFor all he offers now was but his own.\nBut quoth Parmenio that brave Commander,\nWas I as great, as is great Alexander,\nDarius offers I would not reject,\nBut th'kingdomes and the Lady soon accept.\nTo which proud Alexander made reply,\nAnd so if I Parmenio was, would I.\nHe now to Gaza goes, and there doth meet,\nHis Favorite Ephestion with his Fleet,\nWhere valiant Betis stoutly keeps the town,\n(A loyal Subject to Darius Crown)\nFor more repulse the Grecians here abide\nThen in the Persian Monarchy beside;\nAnd by these walls so many men were slain,\nThat Greece was forc'd to yield supply again.\nBut yet this well defended Town was taken,\nFor 'twas decree'd, that Empire should be shaken;\nThus Betis ta'en had holes bor'd through his feet,\nAnd by command was drawn through every street\nTo imitate Achilles in his shame,\nWho did the like to Hector (of more fame)\nWhat hast thou lost thy magnimity,\nCan Alexander deal thus cruelly?\nSith valour with Heroicks is renown'd,\nThough in an Enemy it should be found;\nIf of thy future fame thou hadst regard,\nWhy didst not heap up honours and reward?\nFrom Gaza to Jerusalem he goes,\nBut in no hostile way, (as I suppose)\nHim in his Priestly Robes high Jaddus meets,\nWhom with great reverence Alexander greets;\nThe Priest shews him good Daniel's Prophesy,\nHow he should overthrow this Monarchy,\nBy which he was so much encouraged,\nNo future dangers he did ever dread.\nFrom thence to fruitful Egypt marcht with speed,\nWhere happily in's wars he did succeed;\nTo see how fast he gain'd was no small wonder,\nFor in few dayes he brought that Kingdome under.\nThen to the Phane of Jupiter he went,\nTo be install'd a God, was his intent.\nThe Pagan Priest through hire, or else mistake,\nThe Son of Jupiter did streight him make:\nHe Diobolical must needs remain,\nThat his humanity will not retain.\nThence back to Egypt goes, and in few dayes;\nFair Alexandria from the ground doth raise;\nThen setling all things in less Asia;\nIn Syria, Egypt, and Phenicia,\nUnto Euphrates marcht and overgoes,\nFor no man's there his Army to oppose;\nHad Betis now been there but with his band,\nGreat Alexander had been kept from Land.\nBut as the King, so is the multitude,\nAnd now of valour both are destitute.\nYet he (poor prince) another Host doth muster,\nOf Persians, Scythians, Indians in a cluster;\nMen but in shape and name, of valour none\nMost fit, to blunt the Swords of Macedon.\nTwo hundred fifty thousand by account,\nOf Horse and Foot his Army did amount;\nFor in his multitudes his trust still lay,\nBut on their fortitude he had small stay;\nYet had some hope that on the spacious plain,\nHis numbers might the victory obtain.\nAbout this time Darius beautious Queen,\nWho had sore travail and much sorrow seen,\nNow bids the world adue, with pain being spent,\nWhose death her Lord full sadly did lament.\nGreat Alexander mourns as well as he,\nThe more because not set at liberty;\nWhen this sad news (at first Darius hears,\nSome injury was offered he fears:\nBut when inform'd how royally the King,\nHad used her, and hers, in every thing,\nHe prays the immortal Gods they would reward\nGreat Alexander for this good regard;\nAnd if they down his Monarchy will throw,\nLet them on him this dignity bestow.\nAnd now for peace he sues as once before,\nAnd offers all he did and Kingdomes more;\nHis eldest daughter for his princely bride,\n(Nor was such match in all the world beside)\nAnd all those Countryes which (betwixt) did lye\nPhanisian Sea, and great Euphrates high:\nWith fertile Egypt and rich Syria,\nAnd all those Kingdomes in less Asia.\nWith thirty thousand Talents to be paid,\nFor the Queen Mother, and the royal maid;\nAnd till all this be well perform'd, and sure,\nOchus his Son for Hostage should endure.\nTo this stout Alexander gives no ear,\nNo though Parmenio plead, yet will not hear;\nWhich had he done. (perhaps) his fame he'd kept,\nNor Infamy had wak'd, when he had slept,\nFor his unlimited prosperity\nHim boundless made in vice and Cruelty.\nThus to Darius he writes back again,\nThe Firmament, two Suns cannot contain.\nTwo Monarchyes on Earth cannot abide,\nNor yet two Monarchs in one world reside;\nThe afflicted King finding him set to jar,\nPrepares against to morrow, for the war,\nParmenio, Alexander, wisht that night,\nTo force his Camp, so vanquish them by flight.\nFor tumult in the night doth cause most dread,\nAnd weakness of a Foe is covered,\nBut he disdain'd to steal a victory:\nThe Sun should witness of his valour be,\nAnd careless in his bed, next morne he lyes,\nBy Captains twice is call'd before hee'l rise,\nThe Armyes joyn'd a while, the Persians fight,\nAnd spilt the Greeks some bloud before their flight\nBut long they stood not e're they're forc'd to run,\nSo made an end, As soon as well begun.\nForty five thousand Alexander had,\nBut is not known what slaughter here was made,\nSome write th'other had a million, some more,\nBut Quintus Curtius as before.\nAt Arbela this victory was gain'd,\nTogether with the Town also obtain'd;\nDarius stript of all to Media came,\nAccompan'ed with sorrow, fear, and shame,\nAt Arbela left his Ornaments and Treasure,\nWhich Alexander deals as suits his pleasure.\nThis conqueror to Babylon then goes,\nIs entertain'd with joy and pompous showes,\nWith showrs of flours the streets along are strown,\nAnd incense burnt the silver Altars on.\nThe glory of the Castle he admires,\nThe strong Foundation and the lofty Spires,\nIn this, a world of gold and Treasure lay,\nWhich in few hours was carried all away.\nWith greedy eyes he views this City round,\nWhose fame throughout the world was so renownd\nAnd to possess he counts no little bliss\nThe towres and bowres of proud Semiramis,\nThough worne by time, and rac'd by foes full sore,\nYet old foundations shew'd and somewhat more.\nWith all the pleasures that on earth are found,\nThis city did abundantly abound,\nWhere four and thirty dayes he now did stay,\nAnd gave himself to banqueting and play:\nHe and his souldiers wax effeminate,\nAnd former discipline begin to hate.\nWhilst revelling at Babylon he lyes,\nAntipater from Greece sends fresh supplyes.\nHe then to Shushan goes with his new bands,\nBut needs no force, tis rendred to his hands.\nHe likewise here a world of treasure found;\nFor 'twas the seat of Persian Kings renownd.\nHere stood the royal Houses of delight,\nWhere Kings have shown their glory wealth and might\nThe sumptuous palace of Queen Esther here,\nAnd of good Mordicai, her kinsman dear,\nThose purple hangings, mixt with green and white\nThose beds of gold, and couches of delight.\nAnd furniture the richest in all lands,\nNow fall into the Macedonians hands.\nFrom Shushan to Persipolis he goes,\nWhich news doth still augment Darius woes.\nIn his approach the governour sends word,\nFor his receipt with joy they all accord,\nWith open gates the wealthy town did stand,\nAnd all in it was at his high command.\nOf all the Cities that on earth was found,\nNone like to this in riches did abound:\nThough Babylon was rich and Shushan too\nYet to compare with this they might not doe:\nHere lay the bulk of all those precious things\nThat did pertain unto the Persian Kings:\nFor when the souldiers rifled had their pleasure,\nAnd taken money plate and golden treasure,\nStatues some gold, and silver numberless,\nYet after all, as storyes do express\nThe share of Alexander did amount\nTo an hundred thousand talents by account.\nHere of his own he sets a Garison,\n(As first at Shushan and at Babylon)\nOn their old Governours titles he laid,\nBut on their faithfulness he never staid,\nTheir place gave to his Captains (as was just)\nFor such revolters false, what King can trust?\nThe riches and the pleasures of this town\nNow makes this King his virtues all to drown,\nThat wallowing in all licentiousness,\nIn pride and cruelty to high excess.\nBeing inflam'd with wine upon a season,\nFilled with madness, and quite void of reason,\nHe at a bold proud strumpets leud desire,\nCommands to set this goodly town on fire.\nParmenio wise intreats him to desist\nAnd layes before his eyes if he persist\nHis fames dishonour, loss unto his state,\nAnd just procuring of the Persians hate:\nBut deaf to reason, bent to have his will,\nThose stately streets with raging flame did fill.\nThen to Darius he directs his way,\nWho was retir'd as far as Media,\nAnd there with sorrows, fears & cares surrounded\nHad now his army fourth and last compounded.\nWhich forty thousand made, but his intent\nWas these in Bactria soon to augment:\nBut hearing Alexander was so near,\nThought now this once to try his fortunes here,\nAnd rather chose an honourable death,\nThen still with infamy to draw his breath:\nBut Bessus false, who was his chief Commander\nPerswades him not to fight with Alexander.\nWith sage advice he sets before his eyes\nThe little hope of profit like to rise:\nIf when he'd multitudes the day he lost,\nThen with so few, how likely to be crost.\nThis counsel for his safety he pretended,\nBut to deliver him to's foe intended.\nNext day this treason to Darius known\nTransported sore with grief and passion,\nGrinding his teeth, and plucking off his hair,\nSate overwhelm'd with sorrow and dispair:\nThen bids his servant Artabasus true,\nLook to himself, and leave him to that crew,\nWho was of hopes and comforts quite bereft,\nAnd by his guard and Servitors all left.\nStraight Bessus comes, & with his trait'rous hands\nLayes hold on's Lord, and binding him with bands\nThrows him into a Cart, covered with hides,\nWho wanting means t'resist these wrongs abides,\nThen draws the cart along with chains of gold,\nIn more despight the thraled prince to hold,\nAnd thus t'ward Alexander on he goes,\nGreat recompence for this, he did propose:\nBut some detesting this his wicked fact,\nTo Alexander flyes and tells this act,\nWho doubling of his march, posts on amain,\nDarius from that traitors hands to gain.\nBessus gets knowledg his disloyalty\nHad Alexanders wrath incensed high,\nWhose army now was almost within sight,\nHis hopes being dasht prepares himself for flight:\nUnto Darius first he brings a horse,\nAnd bids him save himself by speedy course:\nThe wofull King his courtesie refuses,\nWhom thus the execrable wretch abuses,\nBy throwing darts gave him his mortal wound,\nThen slew his Servants that were faithfull found,\nYea wounds the beasts that drew him unto death,\nAnd leaves him thus to gasp out his last breath.\nBessus his partner in this tragedy,\nWas the false Governour of Media.\nThis done, they with their host soon speed away,\nTo hide themselves remote in Bactria.\nDarius bath'd in blood, sends out his groans,\nInvokes the heav'ns and earth to hear his moans:\nHis lost felicity did grieve him sore,\nBut this unheard of treachery much more:\nBut above all, that neither Ear nor Eye\nShould hear nor see his dying misery;\nAs thus he lay, Polistrates a Greek,\nWearied with his long march, did water seek,\nSo chanc'd these bloudy Horses to espy,\nWhose wounds had made their skins of purple dye\nTo them repairs then looking in the Cart,\nFinds poor Darius pierced to the heart,\nWho not a little chear'd to have some eye,\nThe witness of this horrid Tragedy;\nPrays him to Alexander to commend\nThe just revenge of this his woful end:\nAnd not to pardon such disloyalty,\nOf Treason, Murther, and base Cruelty.\nIf not, because Darius thus did pray,\nYet that succeeding Kings in safety may\nTheir lives enjoy, their Crowns and dignity,\nAnd not by Traitors hands untimely dye.\nHe also sends his humble thankfulness,\nFor all the Kingly grace he did express;\nTo's Mother, Children dear, and wife now gone.\nWhich made their long restraint seem to be none:\nPraying the immortal Gods, that Sea and Land\nMight be subjected to his royal hand,\nAnd that his Rule as far extended be,\nAs men the rising, setting Sun shall see,\nThis said, the Greek for water doth intreat,\nTo quench his thirst, and to allay his heat:\nOf all good things (quoth he) once in my power,\nI've nothing left, at this my dying hour;\nThy service and compassion to reward,\nBut Alexander will, for this regard.\nThis said, his fainting breath did fleet away,\nAnd though a Monarch late, now lyes like clay;\nAnd thus must every Son of Adam lye,\nThough Gods on Earth like Sons of men they dye.\nNow to the East, great Alexander goes,\nTo see if any dare his might oppose,\nFor scarce the world or any bounds thereon,\nCould bound his boundless fond Ambition;\nSuch as submits again he doth restore\nTheir riches, and their honours he makes more,\nOn Artabaces more then all bestow'd,\nFor his fidelity to's Master show'd.\nThalestris Queen of th'Amazons now brought\nHer Train to Alexander, (as 'tis thought.)\nThough most of reading best and soundest mind,\nSuch Country there, nor yet such people find.\nThen tell her errand, we had better spare\nTo th'ignorant, her title will declare:\nAs Alexander in his greatness grows,\nSo dayly of his virtues doth he lose.\nHe baseness counts, his former Clemency,\nAnd not beseeming such a dignity;\nHis past sobriety doth also bate,\nAs most incompatible to his State;\nHis temperance is but a sordid thing,\nNo wayes becoming such a mighty King;\nHis greatness now he takes to represent\nHis fancy'd Gods above the Firmament.\nAnd such as shew'd but reverence before,\nNow are commanded strictly to adore;\nWith Persian Robes himself doth dignifie,\nCharging the same on his nobility,\nHis manners habit, gestures, all did fashion\nAfter that conquer'd and luxurious Nation.\nHis Captains that were virtuously inclin'd,\nGriev'd at this change of manners and of mind.\nThe ruder sort did openly deride,\nHis feigned Diety and foolish pride;\nThe certainty of both comes to his Ears,\nBut yet no notice takes of what he hears:\nWith those of worth he still desires esteem,\nSo heaps up gifts his credit to redeem\nAnd for the rest new wars and travails finds,\nThat other matters might take up their minds,\nAnd hearing Bessus, makes himself a King,\nIntends that Traitor to his end to bring.\nNow that his Host from luggage might be free,\nAnd with his burthen no man burthened be;\nCommands forthwith each man his fardle bring,\nInto the market place before the King;\nVVhich done, sets fire upon those goodly spoyles,\nThe recompence of travails wars and toyles.\nAnd thus unwisely in a mading fume,\nThe wealth of many Kingdomes did consume,\nBut marvell 'tis that without mutiny,\nThe Souldiers should let pass this injury;\nNor wonder less to Readers may it bring,\nHere to observe the rashness of the King.\nNow with his Army doth he post away\nFalse Bessus to find out in Bactria:\nBut much distrest for water in their march,\nThe drought and heat their bodies sore did parch.\nAt length they came to th'river Oxus brink,\nWhere so immoderately these thirsty drink,\nWhich more mortality to them did bring,\nThen all their warrs against the Persian King.\nHere Alexander's almost at a stand,\nTo pass the River to the other land.\nFor boats here's none, nor near it any wood,\nTo make them Rafts to waft them o're the flood:\nBut he that was resolved in his mind,\nWould without means some transportation find.\nThen from the Carriages the hides he takes,\nAnd stuffing them with straw, he bundles makes.\nOn these together ti'd, in six dayes space,\nThey all pass over to the other place.\nHad Bessus had but valour to his will,\nWith little pain there might have kept them still:\nBut Coward durst not fight, nor could he fly,\nHated of all for's former treachery,\nIs by his own now bound in iron chains,\nA Coller of the same, his neck contains.\nAnd in this sort they rather drag then bring\nThis Malefactor vile before the King,\nWho to Darius brother gives the wretch,\nWith racks and tortures every limb to stretch.\nHere was of Greeks a town in Bactria,\nWhom Xerxes from their Country led away,\nThese not a little joy'd, this day to see,\nWherein their own had got the sov'raignty\nAnd now reviv'd, with hopes held up their head\nFrom bondage long to be Enfranchised.\nBut Alexander puts them to the sword\nWithout least cause from them in deed or word;\nNor Sex, nor age, nor one, nor other spar'd,\nBut in his cruelty alike they shar'd:\nNor reason could he give for this great wrong,\nBut that they had forgot their mother tongue.\nWhile thus some time he spent in Bactria,\nAnd in his camp strong and securely lay,\nDown from the mountains twenty thousand came\nAnd there most fiercely set upon the same:\nRepelling these, two marks of honour got\nImprinted in his leg, by arrows shot.\nThe Bactrians against him now rebel;\nBut he their stubborness in time doth quell.\nFrom hence he to Jaxartis River goes,\nWhere Scythians rude his army doth oppose,\nAnd with their outcryes in an hideous sort\nBeset his camp, or military court,\nOf darts and arrows, made so little spare,\nThey flew so thick, they seem'd to dark the air:\nBut soon his souldiers forc'd them to a flight,\nTheir nakedness could not endure their might.\nUpon this rivers bank in seventeen dayes\nA goodly City doth compleatly raise,\nWhich Alexandria he doth likewise name,\nAnd sixty furlongs could but round the same.\nA third Supply Antipater now sent,\nWhich did his former forces much augment;\nAnd being one hundred twenty thousand strong;\nHe enters then the Indian Kings among:\nThose that submit, he gives them rule again,\nSuch as do not, both them and theirs are slain.\nHis warrs with sundry nations I'le omit,\nAnd also of the Mallians what is writ.\nHis Fights, his dangers, and the hurts he had,\nHow to submit their necks at last they're glad.\nTo Nisa goes by Bacchus built long since,\nWhose feasts are celebrated by this prince;\nNor had that drunken god one who would take\nHis Liquors more devoutly for his sake.\nWhen thus ten days his brain with wine he'd soakt,\nAnd with delicious meats his palate choakt:\nTo th'River Indus next his course he bends,\nBoats to prepare, Ephestion first he sends,\nWho coming thither long before his Lord,\nHad to his mind made all things to accord,\nThe vessels ready were at his command,\nAnd Omphis King of that part of the land,\nThrough his perswasion Alexander meets,\nAnd as his Sov'raign Lord him humbly greets\nFifty six Elephants he brings to's hand,\nAnd tenders him the strength of all his land;\nPresents himself first with a golden crown,\nThen eighty talents to his captains down:\nBut Alexander made him to behold\nHe glory sought, no silver nor no gold;\nHis presents all with thanks he did restore,\nAnd of his own a thousand talents more.\nThus all the Indian Kings to him submit,\nBut Porus stout, who will not yeild as yet:\nTo him doth Alexander thus declare,\nHis pleasure is that forthwith he repair\nUnto his Kingdomes borders, and as due,\nHis homage to himself as Soveraign doe:\nBut kingly Porus this brave answer sent,\nThat to attend him there was his intent,\nAnd come as well provided as he could,\nBut for the rest, his sword advise him should.\nGreat Alexander vext at this reply,\nDid more his valour then his crown envy,\nIs now resolv'd to pass Hydaspes flood,\nAnd there by force his soveraignty make good.\nStout Porus on the banks doth ready stand\nTo give him welcome when he comes to land.\nA potent army with him like a King,\nAnd ninety Elephants for warr did bring:\nHad Alexander such resistance seen\nOn Tygris side, here now he had not been.\nWithin this spacious River deep and wide\nDid here and there Isles full of trees abide.\nHis army Alexander doth divide\nWith Ptolemy sends part to th'other side;\nPorus encounters them and thinks all's there,\nWhen covertly the rest get o're else where,\nAnd whilst the first he valiantly assail'd,\nThe last set on his back, and so prevail'd.\nYet work enough here Alexander found,\nFor to the last stout Porus kept his ground:\nNor was't dishonour at the length to yield,\nWhen Alexander strives to win the field.\nThe kingly Captive 'fore the Victor's brought,\nIn looks or gesture not abased ought,\nBut him a Prince of an undaunted mind\nDid Alexander by his answers find:\nHis fortitude his royal foe commends,\nRestores him and his bounds farther extends.\nNow eastward Alexander would goe still,\nBut so to doe his souldiers had no will,\nLong with excessive travails wearied,\nCould by no means be farther drawn or led,\nYet that his fame might to posterity\nBe had in everlasting memory,\nDoth for his Camp a greater circuit take,\nAnd for his souldiers larger Cabbins make.\nHis mangers he erected up so high\nAs never horse his Provender could eye.\nHuge bridles made, which here and there he left,\nWhich might be found, and for great wonders kept\nTwelve altars then for monuments he rears,\nWhereon his acts and travels long appears.\nBut doubting wearing time might these decay,\nAnd so his memory would fade away,\nHe on the fair Hydaspes pleasant side,\nTwo Cities built, his name might there abide,\nFirst Nicea, the next Bucephalon,\nWhere he entomb'd his stately Stalion.\nHis fourth and last supply was hither sent,\nThen down Hydaspes with his Fleet he went;\nSome time he after spent upon that shore,\nWhether Ambassadors, ninety or more,\nCame with submission from the Indian Kings,\nBringing their presents rare, and precious things,\nThese all he feasts in state on beds of gold,\nHis Furniture most sumptuous to behold;\nHis meat & drink, attendants, every thing,\nTo th'utmost shew'd the glory of a King.\nWith rich rewards he sent them home again,\nAcknowledged their Masters sovereign;\nThen sailing South, and coming to that shore,\nThose obscure Nations yielded as before:\nA City here he built, call'd by his Name,\nWhich could not sound too oft with too much fame\nThen sailing by the mouth of Indus floud,\nHis Gallyes stuck upon the flats and mud;\nWhich the stout Macedonians amazed sore,\nDepriv'd at once the use of Sail and Oar:\nObserving well the nature of the Tide,\nIn those their fears they did not long abide.\nPassing fair Indus mouth his course he steer'd\nTo th'coast which by Euphrates mouth appear'd;\nWhose inlets near unto, he winter spent,\nUnto his starved Souldiers small content,\nBy hunger and by cold so many slain,\nThat of them all the fourth did scarce remain.\nThus winter, Souldiers, and provisions spent,\nFrom hence he then unto Gedrosia went.\nAnd thence he marcht into Carmania,\nAnd so at length drew near to Persia,\nNow through these goodly Countryes as he past,\nMuch time in feasts and ryoting did waste;\nThen visits Cyrus Sepulchre in's way,\nWho now obscure at Passagardis lay:\nUpon his Monument his Robe he spread,\nAnd set his Crown on his supposed head.\nFrom hence to Babylon, some time there spent,\nHe at the last to royal Shushan went;\nA wedding Feast to's Nobles then he makes,\nAnd Statyra, Darius daughter takes,\nHer Sister gives to his Ephestian dear,\nThat by this match he might be yet more near;\nHe fourscore Persian Ladies also gave,\nAt this same time unto his Captains brave:\nSix thousand guests unto this Feast invites,\nWhose Sences all were glutted with delights.\nIt far exceeds my mean abilities\nTo shadow forth these short felicities,\nSpectators here could scarce relate the story,\nThey were so rapt with this external glory:\nIf an Ideal Paradise a man would frame,\nHe might this Feast imagine by the same;\nTo every guess a cup of gold he sends,\nSo after many dayes the Banquet ends.\nNow Alexanders conquests all are done,\nAnd his long Travails past and overgone;\nHis virtues dead, buried, and quite forgot,\nBut vice remains to his Eternal blot.\n'Mongst those that of his cruelty did tast,\nPhilotus was not least, nor yet the last,\nAccus'd because he did not certifie\nThe King of treason and conspiracy:\nUpon suspition being apprehended,\nNothing was prov'd wherein he had offended\nBut silence, which was of such consequence,\nHe was judg'd guilty of the same offence,\nBut for his fathers great deserts the King\nHis royal pardon gave for this foul thing.\nYet is Phylotas unto judgment brought,\nMust suffer, not for what is prov'd, but thought.\nHis master is accuser, judge and King,\nWho to the height doth aggravate each thing,\nInveighs against his father now absent,\nAnd's brethren who for him their lives had spent.\nBut Philotas his unpardonable crime,\nNo merit could obliterate, or time:\nHe did the Oracle of Jove deride,\nBy which his Majesty was diefi'd.\nPhilotas thus o'recharg'd with wrong and grief\nSunk in despair without hope of Relief,\nFain would have spoke and made his own defence,\nThe King would give no ear, but went from thence\nTo his malicious Foes delivers him,\nTo wreak their spight and hate on every limb.\nPhilotas after him sends out this cry,\nO Alexander, thy free clemency\nMy foes exceeds in malice, and their hate\nThy kingly word can easily terminate.\nSuch torments great as wit could worst invent,\nOr flesh and life could bear, till both were spent\nWere now inflicted on Parmenio's son\nHe might accuse himself, as they had done,\nAt last he did, so they were justifi'd,\nAnd told the world, that for his guilt he di'd.\nBut how these Captains should, or yet their master\nLook on Parmenio, after this disaster\nThey knew not, wherefore best now to be done,\nWas to dispatch the father as the son.\nThis sound advice at heart pleas'd Alexander,\nWho was so much ingag'd to this Commander,\nAs he would ne're confess, nor yet reward,\nNor could his Captains bear so great regard:\nWherefore at once, all these to satisfie,\nIt was decreed Parmenio should dye:\nPolidamus, who seem'd Parmenio's friend\nTo do this deed they into Media send:\nHe walking in his garden to and fro,\nFearing no harm, because he none did doe,\nMost wickedly was slain without least crime,\n(The most renowned captain of his time)\nThis is Parmenio who so much had done\nFor Philip dead, and his surviving son,\nWho from a petty King of Macedon\nBy him was set upon the Persian throne,\nThis that Parmenio who still overcame,\nYet gave his Master the immortal fame,\nWho for his prudence, valour, care and trust\nHad this reward, most cruel and unjust.\nThe next, who in untimely death had part,\nWas one of more esteem, but less desert;\nClitus belov'd next to Ephestian,\nAnd in his cups his chief companion;\nWhen both were drunk, Clitus was wont to jeer,\nAlexander to rage, to kill, and swear;\nNothing more pleasing to mad Clitus tongue,\nThen's Masters Godhead to defie and wrong;\nNothing toucht Alexander to the quick,\nLike this against his Diety to kick:\nBoth at a Feast when they had tippled well,\nUpon this dangerous Theam fond Clitus fell;\nFrom jest to earnest, and at last so bold,\nThat of Parmenio's death him plainly told.\nWhich Alexanders wrath incens'd so high,\nNought but his life for this could satisfie;\nFrom one stood by he snatcht a partizan,\nAnd in a rage him through the body ran,\nNext day he tore his face for what he'd done,\nAnd would have slain himself for Clitus gone:\nThis pot Companion he did more bemoan,\nThen all the wrongs to brave Parmenio done.\nThe next of worth that suffered after these,\nWas learned, virtuous, wise Calisthenes,\nVVho lov'd his Master more then did the rest,\nAs did appear, in flattering him the least;\nIn his esteem a God he could not be,\nNor would adore him for a Diety:\nFor this alone and for no other cause,\nAgainst his Sovereign, or against his Laws,\nHe on the Rack his Limbs in pieces rent,\nThus was he tortur'd till his life was spent.\nOf this unkingly act doth Seneca\nThis censure pass, and not unwisely say,\nOf Alexander this th'eternal crime,\nVVhich shall not be obliterate by time.\nVVhich virtues fame can ne're redeem by far,\nNor all felicity of his in war.\nVVhen e're 'tis said he thousand thousands slew,\nYea, and Calisthenes to death he drew.\nThe mighty Persian King he overcame,\nYea, and he kill'd Calistthenes of fame.\nAll Countryes, Kingdomes, Provinces, he wan\nFrom Hellispont, to th'farthest Ocean.\nAll this he did, who knows' not to be true?\nBut yet withal, Catisthenes he slew.\nFrom Macedon, his Empire did extend\nUnto the utmost bounds o' th'orient:\nAll this he did, yea, and much more, 'tis true,\nBut yet withal, Catisthenes he slew.\nNow Alexander goes to Media,\nFinds there the want of wise Parmenio;\nHere his chief favourite Ephestian dies,\nHe celebrates his mournful obsequies:\nHangs his Physitian, the Reason why\nHe suffered, his friend Ephestian dye.\nThis act (me-thinks) his Godhead should a shame,\nTo punish where himself deserved blame;\nOr of necessity he must imply,\nThe other was the greatest Diety.\nThe Mules and Horses are for sorrow shorne,\nThe battlements from off the walls are torne.\nOf stately Ecbatane who now must shew,\nA rueful face in this so general woe;\nTwelve thousand Talents also did intend,\nUpon a sumptuous monument to spend:\nWhat e're he did, or thought not so content,\nHis messenger to Jupiter he sent,\nThat by his leave his friend Ephestion,\nAmong the Demy Gods they might inthrone.\nFrom Media to Babylon he went,\nTo meet him there t'Antipater he'd sent,\nThat he might act also upon the Stage,\nAnd in a Tragedy there end his age.\nThe Queen Olimpias bears him deadly hate,\nNot suffering her to meddle with the State,\nAnd by her Letters did her Son incite,\nThis great indignity he should requite;\nHis doing so, no whit displeas'd the King,\nThough to his Mother he disprov'd the thing.\nBut now Antipater had liv'd so long,\nHe might well dye though he had done no wrong;\nHis service great is suddenly forgot,\nOr if remembred, yet regarded not:\nThe King doth intimate 'twas his intent,\nHis honours and his riches to augment;\nOf larger Provinces the rule to give,\nAnd for his Counsel near the King to live.\nSo to be caught, Antipater's too wise,\nParmenio's death's too fresh before his eyes;\nHe was too subtil for his crafty foe.\nNor by his baits could be insnared so:\nBut his excuse with humble thanks he sends,\nHis Age and journy long he then pretends;\nAnd pardon craves for his unwilling stay,\nHe shews his grief, he's forc'd to disobey.\nBefore his Answer came to Babylon,\nThe thread of Alexanders life was spun;\nPoyson had put an end to's dayes ('twas thought)\nBy Philip and Cassander to him brought,\nSons to Antipater, and bearers of his Cup,\nLest of such like their Father chance to sup;\nBy others thought, and that more generally,\nThat through excessive drinking he did dye:\nThe thirty third of's Age do all agree,\nThis Conquerour did yield to destiny.\nWhen this sad news came to Darius Mother,\nShe laid it more to heart, then any other,\nNor meat, nor drink, nor comfort would she take,\nBut pin'd in grief till life did her forsake;\nAll friends she shuns, yea, banished the light,\nTill death inwrapt her in perpetual night.\nThis Monarchs fame must last whilst world doth stand,\nAnd Conquests be talkt of whilest there is land;\nHis Princely qualities had he retain'd,\nUnparalled for ever had remain'd.\nBut with the world his virtues overcame,\nAnd so with black beclouded, all his fame;\nWise Aristotle Tutor to his youth.\nHad so instructed him in moral Truth:\nThe principles of what he then had learn'd\nMight to the last (when sober) be discern'd.\nLearning and learned men he much regarded,\nAnd curious Artist evermore rewarded:\nThe Illiads of Homer he still kept.\nAnd under's pillow laid them when he slept.\nAchilles happiness he did envy,\n'Cause Homer kept his acts to memory.\nProfusely bountifull without desert,\nFor such as pleas'd him had both wealth and heart\nCruel by nature and by custome too,\nAs oft his acts throughout his reign doth shew:\nAmbitious so, that nought could satisfie,\nVain, thirsting after immortality,\nStill fearing that his name might hap to dye,\nAnd fame not last unto eternity.\nThis Conqueror did oft lament (tis said)\nThere were no more worlds to be conquered.\nThis folly great Augustus did deride,\nFor had he had but wisdome to his pride,\nHe would had found enough there to be done,\nTo govern that he had already won.\nHis thoughts are perisht, he aspires no more,\nNor can he kill or save as heretofore.\nA God alive, him all must Idolize,\nNow like a mortal helpless man he lyes.\nOf all those Kingdomes large which he had got,\nTo his Posterity remain'd no jot;\nFor by that hand which still revengeth bloud,\nNone of his kindred, nor his race long stood:\nBut as he took delight much bloud to spill,\nSo the same cup to his, did others fill.\nFour of his Captains now do all divide,\nAs Daniel before had prophysi'd.\nThe Leopard down, the four wings 'gan to rise,\nThe great horn broke, the less did tyranize.\nWhat troubles and contentions did ensue\nWe may hereafter shew in season due.\nArid\u00e6us.\nGreat Alexander dead, his Armyes left,\nLike to that Giant of his Eye bereft;\nWhen of his monstrous bulk it was the guide,\nHis matchless force no creature could abide.\nBut by Ulisses having lost his sight,\nAll men began streight to contemn his might;\nFor aiming still amiss, his dreadful blows\nDid harm himself, but never reacht his Foes.\nNow Court and Camp all in confusion be,\nA King they'l have, but who, none can agree;\nEach Captain wisht this prize to bear away,\nBut none so hardy found as so durst say:\nGreat Alexander did leave Issue none,\nExcept by Artabasus daughter one;\nAnd Roxane fair whom late he married,\nWas near her time to be delivered.\nBy natures right these had enough to claim,\nBut meaness of their mothers bar'd the same,\nAlledg'd by those who by their subtile Plea\nHad hope themselves to bear the Crown away.\nA Sister Alexander had, but she\nClaim'd not, perhaps, her Sex might hindrance be.\nAfter much tumult they at last proclaim'd\nHis base born brother Arid\u00e6us nam'd,\nThat so under his feeble wit and reign,\nTheir ends they might the better still attain.\nThis choice Perdiccas vehemently disclaim'd,\nAnd Babe unborn of Roxane he proclaim'd;\nSome wished him to take the style of King,\nBecause his Master gave to him his Ring,\nAnd had to him still since Ephestion di'd\nMore then to th'rest his favour testifi'd.\nBut he refus'd, with feigned modesty,\nHoping to be elect more generally.\nHe hold on this occasion should have laid,\nFor second offer there was never made.\n'Mongst these contentions, tumults, jealousies,\nSeven dayes the corps of their great master lies\nUntoucht, uncovered slighted and neglected,\nSo much these princes their own ends respected:\nA Contemplation to astonish Kings,\nThat he who late possest all earthly things,\nAnd yet not so content unless that he\nMight be esteemed for a Diety;\nNow lay a Spectacle to testifie,\nThe wretchedness of mans mortality.\nAfter some time, when stirs began to calm,\nHis body did the Egyptians embalme;\nHis countenance so lively did appear,\nThat for a while they durst not come so near:\nNo sign of poyson in his intrails sound,\nBut all his bowels coloured, well and sound.\nPerdiccas seeing Arideus must be King,\nUnder his name began to rule each thing.\nHis chief Opponent who Control'd his sway,\nWas Meleager whom he would take away,\nAnd by a wile he got him in his power,\nSo took his life unworthily that hour.\nUsing the name, and the command of th'King\nTo authorize his acts in every thing.\nThe princes seeing Perdiccas power and pride,\nFor their security did now provide.\nAntigonus for his share Asia takes,\nAnd Ptolemy next sure of Egypt makes:\nSeleucus afterward held Babylon,\nAntipater had long rul'd Macedon.\nThese now to govern for the king pretends,\nBut nothing less each one himself intends.\nPerdiccas took no province like the rest,\nBut held command of th'Army (which was best)\nAnd had a higher project in his head,\nHis Masters sister secretly to wed:\nSo to the Lady, covertly he sent,\n(That none might know, to frustrate his intent)\nBut Cleopatra this Suitor did deny,\nFor Leonatus more lovely in her eye,\nTo whom she sent a message of her mind,\nThat if he came good welcome he should find.\nIn these tumultuous dayes the thralled Greeks,\nTheir Ancient Liberty afresh now seeks.\nAnd gladly would the yoke shake off, laid on\nSometimes by Philip and his conquering son.\nThe Athenians force Antipater to fly\nTo Lamia where he shut up doth lye.\nTo brave Craterus then he sends with speed\nFor succours to relieve him in his need.\nThe like of Leonatus he requires,\n(Which at this time well suited his desires)\nFor to Antipater he now might goe,\nHis Lady take in th'way, and no man know.\nAntiphilus the Athenian General\nWith speed his Army doth together call;\nAnd Leonatus seeks to stop, that so\nHe joyne not with Antipater their foe.\nThe Athenian Army was the greater far,\n(Which did his Match with Cleopatra mar)\nFor fighting still, while there did hope remain\nThe valiant Chief amidst his foes was slain.\n'Mongst all the princes of great Alexander\nFor personage, none like to this Commander.\nNow to Antipater Craterus goes,\nBlockt up in Lamia still by his foes,\nLong marches through Cilicia he makes,\nAnd the remains of Leonatus takes:\nWith them and his he into Grecia went,\nAntipater releas'd from prisonment:\nAfter which time the Greeks did never more\nAct any thing of worth, as heretofore:\nBut under servitude their necks remain'd,\nNor former liberty or glory gain'd.\nNow di'd about the end of th'Lamian war\nDemosthenes, that sweet-tongue'd Orator,\nWho fear'd Antipater would take his life\nFor animating the Athenian strife:\nTo end his dayes by poison rather chose\nThen fall into the hands of mortal foes.\nCraterus and Antipater now joyne,\nIn love and in affinity combine,\nCraterus doth his daughter Phila wed\nTheir friendship might the more be strengthened.\nWhilst they in Macedon do thus agree,\nIn Asia they all asunder be.\nPerdiccas griev'd to see the princes bold\nSo many Kingdomes in their power to hold,\nYet to regain them, how he did not know,\nHis souldiers 'gainst those captains would not goe\nTo suffer them go on as they begun,\nWas to give way himself might be undone.\nWith Antipater to joyne he sometimes thought,\nThat by his help, the rest might low be brought,\nBut this again dislikes; he would remain,\nIf not in stile, in deed a soveraign;\n(For all the princes of great Alexander\nAcknowledged for Chief that old Commander)\nDesires the King to goe to Macedon,\nWhich once was of his Ancestors the throne,\nAnd by his presence there to nullifie\nThe acts of his Vice-Roy now grown so high.\nAntigonus of treason first attaints,\nAnd summons him to answer his complaints.\nThis he avoids, and ships himself and son,\ngoes to Antipater and tells what's done.\nHe and Craterus, both with him do joyne,\nAnd 'gainst Perdiccas all their strength combine.\nBrave Ptolemy, to make a fourth then sent\nTo save himself from danger imminent.\nIn midst of these garboyles, with wondrous state\nHis masters funeral doth celebrate:\nIn Alexandria his tomb he plac'd,\nWhich eating time hath scarcely yet defac'd.\nTwo years and more, since natures debt he paid,\nAnd yet till now at quiet was not laid.\nGreat love did Ptolemy by this act gain,\nAnd made the souldiers on his side remain.\nPerdiccas hears his foes are all combin'd,\n'Gainst which to goe, is not resolv'd in mind.\nBut first 'gainst Ptolemy he judg'd was best,\nNeer'st unto him, and farthest from the rest,\nLeaves Eumenes the Asian Coast to free\nFrom the invasions of the other three,\nAnd with his army unto Egypt goes\nBrave Ptolemy to th'utmost to oppose.\nPerdiccas surly cariage, and his pride\nDid alinate the souldiers from his side.\nBut Ptolemy by affability\nHis sweet demeanour and his courtesie,\nDid make his own, firm to his cause remain,\nAnd from the other side did dayly gain.\nPerdiccas in his pride did ill intreat\nPython of haughty mind, and courage great.\nWho could not brook so great indignity,\nBut of his wrongs his friends doth certifie;\nThe souldiers 'gainst Perdiccas they incense,\nWho vow to make this captain recompence,\nAnd in a rage they rush into his tent,\nKnock out his brains: to Ptolemy then went\nAnd offer him his honours, and his place,\nWith stile of the Protector, him to grace.\nNext day into the camp came Ptolemy,\nAnd is receiv'd of all most joyfully.\nTheir proffers he refus'd with modesty,\nYields them to Python for his courtesie.\nWith what he held he was now more content,\nThen by more trouble to grow eminent.\nNow comes there news of a great victory\nThat Eumenes got of the other three.\nHad it but in Perdiccas life ariv'd,\nWith greater joy it would have been receiv'd.\nThus Ptolemy rich Egypt did retain,\nAnd Python turn'd to Asia again.\nWhilst Perdiccas encamp'd in Affrica,\nAntigonus did enter Asia,\nAnd fain would Eumenes draw to their side,\nBut he alone most faithfull did abide:\nThe other all had Kingdomes in their eye,\nBut he was true to's masters family,\nNor could Craterus, whom he much did love.\nFrom his fidelity once make him move:\nTwo Battles fought, and had of both the best,\nAnd brave Craterus slew among the rest:\nFor this sad strife he poures out his complaints,\nAnd his beloved foe full sore laments.\nI should but snip a story into bits\nAnd his great Acts and glory much eclipse,\nTo shew the dangers Eumenes befel,\nHis stratagems wherein he did excel:\nHis Policies, how he did extricate\nHimself from out of Lab'rinths intricate:\nHe that at large would satisfie his mind,\nIn Plutarchs Lives his history may find.\nFor all that should be said, let this suffice,\nHe was both valiant, faithfull, patient, wise.\nPython now chose Protector of the state,\nHis rule Queen Euridice begins to hate,\nSees Arrideus must not King it long,\nIf once young Alexander grow more strong,\nBut that her husband serve for supplement,\nTo warm his seat, was never her intent.\nShe knew her birth-right gave her Macedon,\nGrand-child to him who once sat on that throne\nWho was Perdiccas, Philips eldest brother,\nShe daughter to his son, who had no other.\nPythons commands, as oft she countermands;\nWhat he appoints, she purposely withstands.\nHe wearied out at last would needs be gone,\nResign'd his place, and so let all alone:\nIn's room the souldiers chose Antipater,\nWho vext the Queen more then the other far.\nFrom Macedon to Asia he came,\nThat he might settle matters in the same.\nHe plac'd, displac'd, control'd rul'd as he list,\nAnd this no man durst question or resist;\nFor all the nobles of King Alexander\nTheir bonnets vail'd to him as chief Commander.\nWhen to his pleasure all things they had done,\nThe King and Queen he takes to Macedon,\nTwo sons of Alexander, and the rest,\nAll to be order'd there as he thought best.\nThe Army to Antigonus doth leave,\nAnd Government of Asia to him gave.\nAnd thus Antipater the ground-work layes,\nOn which Antigonus his height doth raise,\nWho in few years, the rest so overtops,\nFor universal Monarchy he hopes.\nWith Eumenes he diverse Battels fought,\nAnd by his slights to circumvent him sought:\nBut vain it was to use his policy,\n'Gainst him that all deceits could scan and try.\nIn this Epitome too long to tell\nHow finely Eumenes did here excell,\nAnd by the self same Traps the other laid,\nHe to his cost was righteously repaid.\nBut while these Chieftains doe in Asia fight,\nTo Greece and Macedon lets turn our sight.\nWhen great Antipater the world must leave,\nHis place to Polisperchon did bequeath,\nFearing his son Cassander was unstaid,\nToo rash to bear that charge, if on him laid.\nAntigonus hearing of his decease\nOn most part of Assyria doth seize.\nAnd Ptolemy next to incroach begins,\nAll Syria and Phenicia he wins,\nThen Polisperchon 'gins to act in's place,\nRecalls Olimpias the Court to grace.\nAntipater had banish'd her from thence\nInto Epire for her great turbulence;\nThis new Protector's of another mind,\nThinks by her Majesty much help to find.\nCassander like his Father could not see,\nThis Polisperchons great ability,\nSlights his Commands, his actions he disclaims,\nAnd to be chief himself now bends his aims;\nSuch as his Father had advanc'd to place,\nOr by his favours any way had grac'd\nAre now at the devotion of the Son,\nPrest to accomplish what he would have done;\nBesides he was the young Queens favourite,\nOn whom (t'was thought) she set her chief delight:\nUnto these helps at home he seeks out more,\nGoes to Antigonus and doth implore,\nBy all the Bonds 'twixt him and's Father past,\nAnd for that great gift which he gave him last.\nBy these and all to grant him some supply,\nTo take down Polisperchon grown so high;\nFor this Antigonus did need no spurs,\nHoping to gain yet more by these new stirs,\nStreight furnish'd him with a sufficient aid,\nAnd so he quick returns thus well appaid,\nWith Ships at Sea, an Army for the Land,\nHis proud opponent hopes soon to withstand.\nBut in his absence Polisperchon takes\nSuch friends away as for his Interest makes\nBy death, by prison, or by banishment,\nThat no supply by these here might be lent,\nCassander with his Host to Grecia goes,\nWhom Polisperchon labours to oppose;\nBut beaten was at Sea, and foil'd at Land,\nCassanders forces had the upper hand,\nAthens with many Towns in Greece beside,\nFirm (for his Fathers sake) to him abide.\nWhil'st hot in wars these two in Greece remain,\nAntigonus doth all in Asia gain;\nStill labours Eumenes, would with him side,\nBut all in vain, he faithful did abide:\nNor Mother could, nor Sons of Alexander,\nPut trust in any but in this Commander.\nThe great ones now began to shew their mind,\nAnd act as opportunity they find.\nArid\u00e6us the scorn'd and simple King,\nMore then he bidden was could act no thing.\nPolisperchon for office hoping long,\nThinks to inthrone the Prince when riper grown;\nEuridice this injury disdains,\nAnd to Cassandar of this wrong complains.\nHateful the name and house of Alexander,\nWas to this proud vindicative Cassander;\nHe still kept lockt within his memory,\nHis Fathers danger, with his Family;\nNor thought he that indignity was small,\nWhen Alexander knockt his head to th'wall.\nThese with his love unto the amorous Queen,\nDid make him vow her servant to be seen.\nOlimpias, Arid\u00e6us deadly hates,\nAs all her Husbands, Children by his mates,\nShe gave him poyson formerly ('tis thought)\nWhich damage both to mind and body brought;\nShe now with Polisperchon doth combine,\nTo make the King by force his Seat resigne:\nAnd her young grand-child in his State inthrone,\nThat under him, she might rule, all alone.\nFor aid she goes t'Epire among her friends,\nThe better to accomplish these her ends;\nEuridice hearing what she intends,\nIn haste unto her friend Cassander sends,\nTo leave his siege at Tegea, and with speed,\nTo save the King and her in this their need:\nThen by intreaties, promises and Coyne,\nSome forces did procure with her to joyn.\nOlimpias soon enters Macedon,\nThe Queen to meet her bravely marches on,\nBut when her Souldiers saw their ancient Queen,\nCalling to mind what sometime she had been;\nThe wife and Mother of their famous Kings,\nNor darts, nor arrows, now none shoots or flings.\nThe King and Queen seeing their destiny,\nTo save their lives t'Amphipolis do fly;\nBut the old Queen pursues them with her hate,\nAnd needs will have their lives as well as State:\nThe King by extream torments had his end,\nAnd to the Queen these presents she did send;\nA Halter, cup of poyson, and a Sword,\nBids chuse her death, such kindness she'l afford.\nThe Queen with many a curse, and bitter check,\nAt length yields to the Halter her fair neck;\nPraying that fatal day might quickly haste,\nOn which Olimpias of the like might taste.\nThis done the cruel Queen rests not content,\n'Gainst all that lov'd Cassander she was bent;\nHis Brethren, Kinsfolk and his chiefest friends,\nThat fell within her reach came to their ends:\nDig'd up his brother dead, 'gainst natures right,\nAnd threw his bones about to shew her spight:\nThe Courtiers wondring at her furious mind,\nWisht in Epire she had been still confin'd.\nIn Peloponesus then Cassander lay,\nWhere hearing of this news he speeds away,\nWith rage, and with revenge he's hurried on,\nTo find this cruel Queen in Macedon;\nBut being stopt, at streight Thermopoly,\nSea passage gets, and lands in Thessaly:\nHis Army he divides, sends post away,\nPolisperchon to hold a while in play;\nAnd with the rest Olimpias pursues,\nFor all her cruelty, to give her dues.\nShe with the chief o' th'Court to Pydna flyes,\nWell fortifi'd, (and on the Sea it lyes)\nThere by Cassander she's blockt up so long,\nUntill the Famine grows exceeding strong,\nHer Couzen of Epire did what he might,\nTo raise the Siege, and put her Foes to flight.\nCassander is resolved there to remain,\nSo succours and endeavours proves but vain;\nFain would this wretched Queen capitulate,\nHer foe would give no Ear, (such is his hate)\nThe Souldiers pinched with this scarcity,\nBy stealth unto Cassander dayly fly;\nOlimpias means to hold out to the last,\nExpecting nothing but of death to tast:\nBut his occasions calling him away,\nGives promise for her life, so wins the day.\nNo sooner had he got her in his hand,\nBut made in judgement her accusers stand;\nAnd plead the blood of friends and kindreds spilt,\nDesiring justice might be done for guilt;\nAnd so was he acquitted of his word,\nFor justice sake she being put to th'Sword:\nThis was the end of this most cruel Queen,\nWhose fury scarcely parallel'd hath been.\nThe daughter, sister, Mother, Wife to Kings,\nBut Royalty no good conditions brings;\nTo Husbands death ('tis thought) she gave consent,\nThe murtherer she did so much lament:\nWith Garlands crown'd his head, bemoan'd his fates,\nHis Sword unto Apollo consecrates.\nHer Outrages too tedious to relate,\nHow for no cause but her inveterate hate;\nHer Husbands wives and Children after's death,\nSome slew, some fry'd, of others stopt the breath:\nNow in her Age she's forc'd to tast that Cup,\nWhich she had others often made to sup.\nNow many Towns in Macedon supprest,\nAnd Pellas fain to yield among the rest;\nThe Funerals Cassander celebrates,\nOf Arid\u00e6us and his Queen with State:\nAmong their Ancestors by him they're laid,\nAnd shews of lamentation for them made.\nOld Thebes he then rebuilt so much of fame,\nAnd Cassandria rais'd after his name.\nBut leave him building, others in their Urne,\nLet's for a while, now into Asia turn.\nTrue Eumenes endeavours by all Skill,\nTo keep Antigonus from Shushan still;\nHaving command o'th' Treasure he can hire,\nSuch as no threats, nor favour could acquire.\nIn divers Battels he had good success,\nAntigonus came off still honourless;\nWhen Victor oft he'd been, and so might still,\nPeucestes did betray him by a wile.\nT'Antigonus, who took his Life unjust,\nBecause he never would forgoe his trust;\nThus lost he all for his fidelity,\nStriving t'uphold his Masters Family.\nBut to a period as that did haste,\nSo Eumenes (the prop) of death must tast;\nAll Persia now Antigonus doth gain,\nAnd Master of the Treasure sole remain:\nThen with Seleucus streight at odds doth fall,\nAnd he for aid to Ptolomy doth call,\nThe Princes all begin now to envy\nAntigonus, he growing up so high;\nFearing his force, and what might hap e're long,\nEnters into a Combination strong,\nSeleucus, Ptolemy, Cassander joynes,\nLysimachus to make a fourth combines:\nAntigonus desirous of the Greeks,\nTo make Cassander odious to them seeks,\nSends forth his declarations near and far,\nAnd clears what cause he had to make this war,\nCassanders outrages at large doth tell,\nShews his ambitious practises as well.\nThe mother of their King to death he'd put,\nHis wife and son in prison close had shut:\nAnd aiming now to make himself a king,\nAnd that some title he might seem to bring,\nThessalonica he had newly wed,\nDaughter to Philip their renowned head:\nHad built and call'd a City by his name,\nWhich none e're did, but those of royal fame:\nAnd in despight of their two famous Kings\nHatefull Olinthians to Greece rebrings.\nRebellious Thebes he had reedified,\nWhich their late King in dust had damnified,\nRequires them therefore to take up their arms\nAnd to requite this traitor for these harms.\nThen Ptolemy would gain the Greeks likewise,\nAnd he declares the others injuryes:\nFirst how he held the Empire in his hands,\nSeleucus driven from Goverment and lands,\nThe valiant Eumenes unjustly slain,\nAnd Lord of royal Shushan did remain;\nTherefore requests their help to take him down\nBefore he wear the universal Crown.\nThese princes at the sea soon had a fight,\nWhere great Antigonus was put to flight:\nHis son at Gaza likewise lost the field,\nSo Syria to Ptolemy did yield:\nAnd Seleucus recovers Babylon,\nStill gaining Countryes eastward he goes on.\nDemetrius with Ptolemy did fight,\nAnd coming unawares, put him to flight;\nBut bravely sends the prisoners back again,\nWith all the spoyle and booty he had tane.\nCourteous as noble Ptolemy, or more,\nVVho at Gaza did the like to him before.\nAntigonus did much rejoyce, his son\nVVith victory, his lost repute had won.\nAt last these princes tired out with warrs,\nSought for a peace, and laid aside their jarrs:\nThe terms of their agreement, thus express\nThat each should hold what now he did possess,\nTill Alexander unto age was grown,\nVVho then should be enstalled in the throne.\nThis toucht Cassander sore for what he'd done,\nImprisoning both the mother and the son:\nHe sees the Greeks now favour their young Prince\nWhom he in durance held, now, and long since,\nThat in few years he must be forc'd or glad,\nTo render up such Kingdomes as he had;\nResolves to quit his fears by one deed done,\nSo puts to death the Mother and her Son.\nThis Roxane for her beauty all commend,\nBut for one act she did, just was her end.\nNo sooner was great Alexander dead,\nBut she Darius daughters murthered.\nBoth thrown into a well to hide her blot,\nPerdiccas was her Partner in this plot.\nThe heavens seem'd slow in paying her the same;\nBut at the last the hand of vengeance came.\nAnd for that double fact which she had done,\nThe life of her must goe, and of her son\nPerdiccas had before for his amiss,\nBut by their hands who thought not once of this.\nCassanders deed the princes do detest,\nBut 'twas in shew; in heart it pleas'd them best.\nThat he is odious to the world, they'r glad:\nAnd now they were free Lords of what they had.\nWhen this foul tragedy was past and done,\nPolysperchon brings the other son\nCall'd Hercules, and elder then his brother,\n(But Olimpias would prefer the other)\nThe Greeks toucht with the murther done of late,\nThis Orphan prince 'gan to compassionate,\nBegin to mutter much 'gainst proud Cassander,\nAnd place their hopes on th'heir of Alexander.\nCassander fear'd what might of this ensue,\nSo Polisperchon to his counsel drew,\nAnd gives Peloponesus for his hire,\nWho slew the prince according to desire.\nThus was the race and house of Alexander\nExtinct by this inhumane wretch Cassander.\nAntigonus, for all this doth not mourn,\nHe knows to's profit, this at last will turn,\nBut that some Title now he might pretend,\nTo Cleopatra doth for marriage send;\nLysimachus and Ptolemy the same,\nAnd lewd Cassander too, sticks not for shame:\nShe then in Lydia at Sardis lay,\nWhere by Embassage all these Princes pray.\nChoice above all, of Ptolemy she makes,\nWith his Embassador her journy takes;\nAntigonus Lieutenant stayes her still,\nUntill he further know his Masters will:\nAntigonus now had a Wolf by th'Ears,\nTo hold her still, or let her go he fears.\nResolves at last the Princess should be slain,\nSo hinders him of her, he could not gain;\nHer women are appointed for this deed,\nThey for their great reward no better speed:\nFor by command, they streight were put to death,\nAs vile Conspirators that stopt her breath.\nAnd now he hopes, he's order'd all so well,\nThe world must needs believe what he doth tell;\nThus Philips house was quite extinguished,\nExcept Cassanders wife who yet not dead.\nAnd by their means who thought of nothing less,\nThen vengeance just, against them to express;\nNow blood was paid with blood for what was done\nBy cruel Father, Mother, cruel Son:\nThus may we hear, and fear, and ever say,\nThat hand is righteous still which doth repay.\nThese Captains now the stile of Kings do take,\nFor to their Crowns their's none can Title make;\nDemetrius first the royal stile assum'd,\nBy his Example all the rest presum'd.\nAntigonus himself to ingratiate,\nDoth promise liberty to Athens State;\nWith Arms and with provision stores them well,\nThe better 'gainst Cassander to rebel.\nDemetrius thether goes, is entertain'd\nNot like a King, but like some God they feign'd;\nMost grosly base was their great Adulation,\nWho Incense burnt, and offered oblation:\nThese Kings afresh fall to their wars again,\nDemetrius of Ptolemy doth gain.\n'Twould be an endless Story to relate\nTheir several Battels and their several fate,\nTheir fights by Sea, their victories by Land,\nHow some when down, straight got the upper hand\nAntigonus and Seleucus then fight\nNear Ephesus, each bringing all his might,\nAnd he that Conquerour shall now remain,\nThe Lordship of all Asia shall retain;\nThis day 'twixt these two Kings ends all the strife,\nFor here Antigonus lost rule and life:\nNor to his Son, did e're one foot remain\nOf those vast Kingdomes, he did sometimes gain.\nDemetrius with his Troops to Athens flyes,\nHopes to find succours in his miseries;\nBut they adoring in prosperity,\nNow shut their gates in his adversity:\nHe sorely griev'd at this his desperate State\nTryes Foes, sith friends will not compassionate.\nHis peace he then with old Seleucus makes,\nWho his fair daughter Stratonica takes,\nAntiochus, Seleucus, dear lov'd Son,\nIs for this fresh young Lady quite undone;\nFalls so extreamly sick, all fear'd his life,\nYet durst not say, he lov'd his Fathers wife,\nWhen his disease the skill'd Physitian found,\nHis Fathers mind he wittily did sound,\nWho did no sooner understand the same,\nBut willingly resign'd the beautious Dame:\nCassander now must dye his race is run,\nAnd leaves the ill got Kingdomes he had won.\nTwo Sons he left, born of King Philips daughter,\nWho had an end put to their dayes by slaughter;\nWhich should succeed at variance they fell,\nThe Mother would, the youngest might excell:\nThe eld'st inrag'd did play the Vipers part,\nAnd with his Sword did run her through the heart:\nRather then Philips race should longer live,\nHe whom she gave his life her death shall give.\nThis by Lysimacus was after slain,\nWhose daughter he not long before had ta'ne;\nDemetrius is call'd in by th'youngest Son,\nAgainst Lysimachus who from him won.\nBut he a Kingdome more then's friend did eye,\nSeaz'd upon that, and slew him traitrously.\nThus Philips and Cassander's race both gone,\nAnd so falls out to be extinct in one;\nAnd though Cassander died in his bed,\nHis Seed to be extirpt, was destined;\nFor blood, which was decre'd that he should spill,\nYet must his Children pay for Fathers ill;\nJehu in killing Ahab's house did well,\nYet be aveng'd must blood of Jezerel.\nDemetrius thus Cassander's Kingdoms gains,\nAnd now in Macedon as King he reigns;\nThough men and mony both he hath at will,\nIn neither finds content if he sits still:\nThat Seleucus holds Asia grievs him sore,\nThose Countryes large his Father got before.\nThese to recover, musters all his might,\nAnd with his Son in Law will needs go fight;\nA mighty Navy rig'd, an Army stout,\nWith these he hopes to turn the world about:\nLeaving Antigonus his eldest Son,\nIn his long absence to rule Macedon.\nDemetrius with so many troubles met,\nAs Heaven and Earth against him had been set;\nDisaster on disaster him pursue,\nHis story seems a Fable more then true.\nAt last he's taken and imprisoned\nWithin an Isle that was with pleasures fed,\nInjoy'd what ere beseem'd his Royalty,\nOnly restrained of his liberty:\nAfter three years he died, left what he'd won,\nIn Greece unto Antigonus his Son.\nFor his Posterity unto this day,\nDid ne're regain one foot in Asia;\nHis Body Seleucus sends to his Son,\nWhose obsequies with wondrous pomp was done.\nNext di'd the brave and noble Ptolemp,\nRenown'd for bounty, valour, clemency,\nRich Egypt left, and what else he had won,\nTo Philadelphus his more worthy Son.\nOf the old Heroes, now but two remain,\nSeleucus and Lysimachus these twain,\nMust needs go try their fortune and their might,\nAnd so Lysimachus was slain in fight;\n'Twas no small joy unto Seleucus breast,\nThat now he had out-lived all the rest:\nPossession of Europe thinks to take,\nAnd so himself the only Monarch make;\nWhilst with these hopes in Greece he did remain,\nHe was by Ptolemy Ceraunus slain.\nThe second Son of the first Ptolemy,\nWho for Rebellion unto him did fly;\nSeleucus was a Father and a friend,\nYet by him had this most unworthy end.\nThus with these Kingly Captains have we done,\nA little now how the Succession run,\nAntigonus, Seleucus and Cassander,\nWith Ptolemy, reign'd after Alexander;\nCassander's Sons soon after's death were slain,\nSo three Successors only did remain:\nAntigonus his Kingdomes lost and life,\nUnto Seleucus, Author of that strife.\nHis Son Demetrius, all Cassanders gains,\nAnd his posterity, the same retains;\nDemetrius Son was call'd Antigonus,\nAnd his again was nam'd Demetrius.\nI must let pass those many Battels fought,\nBetwixt those Kings, and noble Pyrrhus stout,\nAnd his Son Alexander of Epire,\nWhereby immortal honour they acquire;\nDemetrius had Philip to his Son,\n(Part of whose Kingdomes Titus Quintius won)\nPhilip had Perseus, who was made a Thrale\nT'Emilius the Roman General;\nHim with his Sons in Triumph lead did he,\nSuch riches too as Rome did never see:\nThis of Antigonus, his Seed's the Fate,\nVVhose Empire was subdu'd to th'Roman State.\nLonger Seleucus held the royalty,\nIn Syria by his Posterity;\nAntiochus Soter his Son was nam'd,\nTo whom the old Berosus (so much fam'd,)\nHis Book of Assurs Monarchs dedicates,\nTells of their names, their wars, their riches, fates;\nBut this is perished with many more,\nVVhich oft we wish was extant as before.\nAntiochus Theos was Soter's Son,\nVVho a long war with Egypts King begun;\nThe Affinityes and Wars Daniel sets forth,\nAnd calls them there the Kings of South & North,\nThis Theos murther'd was by his lewd wife,\nSeleucus reign'd, when he had lost his life.\nA third Seleucus next sits on the Seat,\nAnd then Antiochus sirnam'd the great,\nVVhose large Dominions after was made small,\nBy Scipio the Roman General;\nFourth Seleucus Antiochus succeeds,\nAnd next Epiphanes whose wicked deeds,\nHorrid Massacres, Murthers, cruelties,\nAmongst the Jews we read in Machabees.\nAntiochus Eupater was the next,\nBy Rebels and Impostors dayly vext;\nSo many Princes still were murthered,\nThe Royal Blood was nigh extinguished;\nThen Tygranes the great Armenian King,\nTo take the Government was called in,\nLucullus, Him, (the Roman General)\nVanquish'd in fight, and took those Kingdomes all;\nOf Greece and Syria thus the rule did end,\nIn Egypt next, a little time wee'l spend.\nFirst Ptolemy being dead, his famous Son\nCall'd Philadelphus, did possess the Throne.\nAt Alexandria a Library did build,\nAnd with seven hundred thousand Volumes fill'd;\nThe seventy two Interpreters did seek,\nThey might translate the Bible into Greek.\nHis Son was Evergetes the last Prince,\nThat valour shew'd, virtue, or excellence,\nPhilopater was Evergetes Son,\nAfter Epiphanes sate on the Throne;\nPhilometor, Evergetes again,\nAnd after him, did false Lathurus reign:\nThen Alexander in Lathurus stead,\nNext Auletes, who cut off Pompeys head.\nTo all these names, we Ptolemy must add,\nFor since the first, they still that Title had.\nFair Cleopatra next, last of that race,\nWhom Julius C\u00e6sar set in Royal place,\nShe with her Paramour, Mark Anthony\nHeld for a time, the Egyptian Monarchy,\nTill great Augustus had with him a fight\nAt Actium, where his Navy's put to flight;\nHe seeing his honour lost, his Kingdome end,\nDid by his Sword his life soon after send.\nHis brave Virago Aspes sets to her Arms,\nTo take her life, and quit her from all harms;\nFor 'twas not death nor danger she did dread,\nBut some disgrace in triumph to be led.\nHere ends at last the Grecian Monarchy,\nWhich by the Romans had its destiny;\nThus King & Kingdomes have their times & dates,\nTheir standings, overturnings, bounds and fates:\nNow up, now down now chief, & then broght under,\nThe heavn's thus rule, to fil the world with wonder\nThe Assyrian Monarchy long time did stand,\nBut yet the Persian got the upper hand;\nThe Grecian them did utterly subdue,\nAnd millions were subjected unto few:\nThe Grecian longer then the Persian stood,\nThen came the Roman like a raging flood;\nAnd with the torrent of his rapid course,\nTheir Crowns their Titles, riches bears by force.\nThe first was likened to a head of gold.\nNext Arms and breast of silver to behold,\nThe third, Belly and Thighs of brass in sight,\nAnd last was Iron, which breaketh all with might;\nThe stone out of the mountain then did rise,\nand smote those feet those legs, those arms & thighs\nThen gold, silver, brass, Iron and all the store,\nBecame like Chaff upon the threshing Floor.\nThe first a Lion, second was a Bear,\nThe third a Leopard, which four wings did rear;\nThe last more strong and dreadful then the rest,\nWhose Iron teeth devoured every Beast,\nAnd when he had no appetite to eat,\nThe residue he stamped under feet;\nYet shall this Lion, Bear, this Leopard, Ram,\nAll trembling stand before the powerful Lamb.\nWith these three Monarchyes now have I done,\nBut how the fourth, their Kingdomes from them won,\nAnd how from small beginnings it did grow,\nTo fill the world with terrour and with woe;\nMy tyred brain leavs to some better pen,\nThis task befits not women like to men:\nFor what is past, I blush, excuse to make,\nBut humbly stand, some grave reproof to take;\nPardon to crave for errours, is but vain,\nThe Subject was too high, beyond my strain,\nTo frame Apology for some offence,\nConverts our boldness into impudence:\nThis my presumption some now to requite,\nNe sutor ultra crepidum may write.\nThe End of the Grecian Monarchy.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 25, "api_path": "/songs/366585", "artist_names": "Mike Judge",

Just a moment.\n\n(repeats that over and over)\n\nBill comes up to Peter.\n\nBILL\nHello, Peter. What's happening? Uh\u2026 we have sort of a problem here.\nYeah. You apparently didn't put one of the new coversheets on your TPS\nreports.\n\nPETER\nOh, yeah. I'm sorry about that. I, I forgot.\n\nBILL\nMmmm... Yeah. You see, we're putting the coversheets on all TPS reports now before they go out. Did you see the memo about this?\n\nPETER\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've got the memo right here, but, uh, uh, I just\nforgot. But, uh, it's not shipping out until tomorrow, so there's no\nproblem.\n\nBILL\nYeah. If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on,\nthat will be great. And Uh, I'll go ahead and make sure you get another\ncopy of that memo Mmmm, Ok?\nHe walks away.\n\nPETER\nYeah, yeah, I've got the memo, I've got -\n\nHe picks it up but Bill's at another cubicle.\n\nBILL\nHello, Phil.

Uh, could you turn that down just a little bit?\n\nMILTON\nUh, they said I could listen to the radio at a reasonable volume from\nnine to eleven while I'm collating\u2026.\n\nPETER\nBut, no, no, no. I know you're allowed to, I was just thinking, like a\npersonal favor, y'know?\n\nMILTON\nI, I told Bill that if Sandra's going to listen to her headphones while\nshe' working, I can listen to the radio while I'm collating -\n\nPETER\nOk.\n\nMILTON\nSo I don't see why -\n\nPETER\nOk.\n\nMILTON\nThe radio, I can't -\n\nPETER\nYeah!

It's just that we're putting new coversheets on all the TPS\nreports before now before they go out now. So I'd really appreciate it\nif you could just remember to do that. from now on. That'd be great.\n\nHe walks away. Peter's phone rings and he answers it.\n\nPETER\nPeter Gibbons. (listens) Yes. (listens) I have the memo.\n\n[Scene Another part of the room. Paper jams in the printer.]\n\nSAMIR\nOh no! Not again! Why does it say paper jam when there is no paper\njam?!! I, I swear to God, one of these days, I, I, I just kick this\npiece of shit out the window!!!\n\nMICHAEL\nyou and me both, man. The thing is lucky I'm not armed.\n\nSamir grabs the paper out, tearing off the bottom part of it.\n\nSAMIR\nPiece of shit!!\n\nNina comes with papers.\n\nNINA\nSam...ire...Na...Na...Naga...\n\nSamir gets it.\n\nNINA\nUh-huh!\n\nSAMIR\nPlease.\n\nHe sits in his and Michael's cubicle.\n\nNINA\nMichael\u2026 - (Michael reaches for it) Bolton?\n\nMICHAEL\nThat's me.\n\nNINA\nWow! Is that your real name?\n\nMICHAEL\nYeah.\n\nNINA\nSo are you related to the singer guy?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, it's just a coincidence.\n\nSAMIR\nHow come no one in this country can pronounce my name right? It's Na-\ngee-een-ah-jah. Nagaenajar\n\nMICHAEL\nAt least your name isn't Michael Bolton.\n\nSAMIR\nMichael, there's nothing wrong with that name.\n\nMICHAEL\nThere was nothing wrong with it. Until I was about nine years old and\nthat no-talent assclown became famous and started winning Grammys.\n\nSAMIR\nWell, why don't just go by Mike, instead of Michael?\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy should I change it? He's the one who sucks.\n\n(Peter comes up to their cubicle.)\n\nPETER\nHey guys.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat's up G?\n\nPETER\nWanna go to Chotchkie's, get some coffee?\n\nSAMIR\nIt's a little early...\n\nPETER\nI gotta get out of here. I think I'm gonna lose it.\n\nNINA\nUh oh. Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.\n\n[Scene Chotchkie's. They're sitting at a booth thing.]\n\nPETER\nBoy. I tell ya, one of these days... One of these days it's gonna be\nlike\n\nHe mimics a machine gun. Brian, a waiter, does it too, in Peter's face\n\nBRIAN\n(Laughs)\nSo can I get you gentlemen something more to drink? Or maybe something to nibble on? Some pizza shooters, shrimp poppers, or extreme fajitas?\n\nPETER\nJust coffee.\n\nBRIAN\nOh. Sounds like a case of the Mondays.\n\n(He goes to take some more orders.)\n\nPETER\nWhat if we're still doing this when we're 50?\n\nSAMIR\nIt could be nice to have that kind of job security.\n\nPETER\nLumbergh's gonna have me work on Saturday, I, I can tell already. I'm\ndoing it because, because, uh, I'm a big pussy. Which is why I work at\nInitech to begin with.\n\nMICHAEL\nUh, I work at Initech and I don't consider myself a pussy, ok?\n\nSAMIR\nYes, I am also not a pussy.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm gonna find out the hard way that I'm not a pussy if they don't\nstart treating us software people better.\n\nSAMIR\nThat's right.\n\nMICHAEL\nThey don't understand. I could come up with a program that could rip\nthat place off big time\u2026big time.\n\nPETER\nYeah.\n\nCut to Joanna, a pretty waitress.\n\nCut back to the guys.\n\nPETER\nOh, there she is.\n\nSAMIR\nPeter, you, you always talk about this girl. If you're so obsessed with\nher, why don't you just ask her out?\n\nPETER\nBecause I'm just another asshole customer. You can't just walk up to a\nwaitress and ask her out.\n(cut to Joanna, and back to them)\nPlus, I'm still trying to work it out with Anne. Oh, that reminds me.\nI'm not going to be able to play poker with you guys on Friday.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy not?\n\nPETER\nUh, I have to see this occupational hypnotherapist with Anne.\n\nMICHAEL\nDude! An occupational hypnotherapist?!\n\nPETER\nAnne wants me to go. She thinks it might help. Y'know, sometimes I just\nthink, I keep thinking that she's cheating on me.\n\nMICHAEL\nYeah. I know what you mean.\n\nSAMIR\nYeah.\n\nPETER\nWhat is that supposed to mean?\n\nMICHAEL\nNothing. Why don't you just tell Anne you're not into hypnosis and you\nwant to play poker with us?\n\nPETER\nAh, I can't do that. She might get all pissed off at me. Besides, I\nthink the guy might be able to help. He did help Anne lose weight.\n\nSAMIR\nPeter, she's anorexic.\n\nPETER\nYeah, I know. The guy's really good.\n\nMICHAEL\nAn occupational hypnotherapist isn't going to help you solve any of\nyour problems. And speaking of problems, what's this I hear about you\nhaving problems with your TPS reports?\n\nSAMIR\nYeah. Didn't you get that memo?\n\nPeter sighs.\n\n[Scene Outside Initech. Tom, another employee, runs across the street,\ntowards Samir, Peter and Michael.]\n\nTOM\nHey! Hey, guys! Samir!!\n\nSAMIR\nIs that Tom Smykowski?\n\nPETER\nWhat's he doing?\n\nMICHAEL\nOh, probably working on another heart attack.\n\nTOM\nHave you guys see this?\n\nHe hands them a piece of paper.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat? It's the staff meeting. So what?\n\nTOM\nWe're all screwed, that's what. They're gonna downsize Initech.\n\nSAMIR\nOh, what are you talking about Tom? How do you know that?\n\nTOM\nThey're bringing in a consultant - that's how I know. That's what this\nstaff meeting is all about! That's what happened at Initrode last year.\nYou have an interview with a consultant and they bring in efficiency\nexperts. You're interviewing for your own job!\n\nMICHAEL\nTom, every week you say you're losing your job and you're still here.\n\nTOM\nI'm going to be the first one they're gonna lay off. Just the thought\nof having to go to the State Unemployment Office and having to stand in\nline with those scumbags!!!\n\n[Scene Michael and Samir's cubicle. They're sitting there worrying.]\n\nMICHAEL\nShit. Shit.\n\nTOM\nYou know there are people in this world who don't have to put up with\nall this shit? Like that guy that invented the pet rock. You see,\nthat's what you have to do. You have to use your mind and come up with\nsome really great idea like that and you never have to work again!\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't think the pet rock was really such a good idea.\n\nTOM\nThe guy made a million dollars! Y'know\u2026 I had an idea like that once.\n\nPETER\nReally? What was it, Tom?\n\nTOM\nWell, all right. It was a Jump\u2026 to Conclusions-mat. You see, it would\nbe this mat that you would put on the floor and it would have different\nconclusions written on it that you could\u2026jump to.\n\nMICHAEL\nThat is the worse idea I've ever heard in my life, Tom.\n\nSAMIR\nYes, yes, it's horrible\u2026this idea\u2026.\n\nTOM\nAh, look. I, I gotta get outta here. I'll see you guys later, if I\nstill have a job.\n\nHe goes to his cubicle.\n\nPETER\nOur high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you would do if\nwe had a million dollars and didn't have to work. And invariably,\nwhatever we would say, that was supposed to be our careers. If you\nwanted to build cars, then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic.\n\nSAMIR\nSo what did you say?\n\nPETER\nI never had an answer. I guess that's why I'm working at Initech.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, you're working at Initech because that question is bullshit to\nbegin with.\n(The printer is not working)\nIf that quiz worked, there would be no janitors, because no one would\nclean shit up if they had a million dollars.\n\nSAMIR\nWell, I would invest half of it in ??? Mutual Funds and give the rest\nof it to my friend, Saheib, in Securities.\n\nMICHAEL\nSamir, the point of the exercise is that you could figure out what you\nwant to do. And then\u2026\n(reads the printer's display)\n\"PC load letter\"?!! What the fuck does that mean?!!\n\nHe knocks off the paper tray.\n\n[Scene Peter's apartment. He enters, tired, and sits down on the couch.\nHe then turns on the TV.]\n\nLAWRENCE\n(V/O, FROM NEXT DOOR)\nHEY PETER-MAN! CHECK OUT CHANNEL NINE! IT'S THE BREAST EXAM! CHECK OUT\nTHIS CHICK!\n\nPETER\nLawrence, can't you just pretend like we can't hear each other through\nthe wall?\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh! I'm sorry man, is Anne over there or something?\n\nPETER\nNo! But if you just want to talk to me, just come over.\n\nLawrence does so; it takes him like ten seconds.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHey man. Check this out, dude.\n\nHe changes channels a bunch of times\n\nPepsi commercial, a soap opera and another show. He stops on breast\nexam.\n\nPETER\nOh geez, Lawrence.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm sorry, man. I thought you'd wanna see this. Doesn't this chick look\nlike Anne?\n\nPETER\nYeah, a little bit.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHey, she hasn't been over here in a while. You two still going out?\n\nPETER\nI guess, yeah. I, I don't know. Sometimes I get the feeling that she's\ncheating on me.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYeah, I get that feeling too, man.\n\nPETER\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI don't know , man, I just get that feeling looking at her, like - I'm\nsorry, man. Look, I, I, I, I, I, I'm talking out of my ass. I don't\nknow.\n\nHe gets up.\n\nPETER\nIt's ok. I just had a rough day.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTell me about it, man.\n(sits on the couch)\nI gotta wake my ass up at six AM every day of this week and drag\nmyself up to Vascalinas. Yeah, I'm doing the drywall up there at the\nnew McDonalds.\n\nPETER\nLet me ask you something. When you come in on Mondays, and you're not\nfeeling too well, does anybody ever come up to you and say \"sounds like\nsomeone's got a case of the Mondays\"?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. No, man, shit, no, man. I believe you get your ass kicked for\nsayin' something like that, man.\n\nPETER\nHuh.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe still going fishing this weekend?\n\nPETER\nNah. Lumbergh's gonna make me come in this Saturday. I know it.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWell, you can get out of that easily.\n\nPETER\nYeah, how?\n\nLAWRENCE\n(Gets up)\nWell, when you work on an Saturday, he generally asks you at the end of\nthe day, right?\n(gets a beer)\nSo all you have to do is avoid him \u2013\n(peter offers him a bottle cap remover)\nThat's all right, i got one \u2013\n(he gets on from his pocket)\nThe last few hours of the day. And turn off your answering machine, you\nshould be home free then.\n\nPETER\nThat's a really good idea. (sits on the couch) Lawrence, what would you\ndo if you had a million dollars?\n\nHe sits down.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'll tell you what I'll do, man--Two chicks at the same time.\n\nPeter laughs.\n\nPETER\nThat's it? If you had a million dollars, that's what you'd do, two\nchicks at the same time?\n\nLAWRENCE\nDamn straight, man. I've always wanted to do that. I figure if I were a\nmillionaire, I could hook that up. Chicks dig guys with money.\n\nPETER\nWell not all chicks\u2026.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWell, the type that double up on a guy like me do.\n\nPETER\nGood point.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNOW, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?\n\nPETER\nBesides two chicks at the same time?\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh yeah.\n\nPETER\nNothing.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNothing, huh?\n\nPETER\nI would relax, I would sit on my ass all day, I would do nothing.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYou don't need a million dollars to do nothing, man. Take a look at my\ncousin. He's broke and don't do shit.\n\n[Scene Peter's room. He's in bed and he keeps hearing voices.]\n\nNINA\nCorporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate payroll,\nNina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a\nmoment.\n\nPeter buries his head in his pillow.\n\n[Scene The staff meeting. Peter's watch reads Friday 12, 10:37.\nEveryone's standing outside their cubicles. There's a banner that says\n\"Is This Good for the COMPANY?\"]\n\nBILL\nSo you should ask yourself, with every decision that you make (points\nto the banner) Is this good for the company? Am I helping the best way\nthat I can for the company...\n\nPETER\nIs that the guy?\n\nTOM\nYeah...\n\nBILL\nGood. Well, uh, I'd like to, uh, welcome a new member to our team. Uh,\nBob Slydell. Yeah. Uh, he is, uh, a consultant. Yeah. He is a\nconsultant. (Tom shakes his head) He'll be helping us out a little\nhere, asking some questions, making sure things go a little more\nsmoothly. Yeah. Oh and remember, next Friday is Hawaiian shirt day! So,\ny'know, if you want to, go ahead and uh, wear a Hawaiian shirt and\njeans.\n\n[Scene Milton's cubicle, under the banner. He's on the phone with\nPeter.]\n\nMILTON\nI, I don't care if they, if they lay me off either, because I, I told\nBill that if he moves my desk one more time, then, then I'm quitting.\nI'm going to quit. And I told Dom too because they've moved my desk\nfour times. I used to be by the window, where I could see the squirrels\nand they were merry. But then they switched from the Swingline to the\nBoston stapler, but I kept my Swingline. (he's holding his red\nSwingline) (Camera pans to Peter) They have my staples for the Boston\nand I kept the staples from the Swingline stapler.\n\nPETER\nOk, Milton.\n\nMILTON\nAnd if, if they take my stapler, I will, I will set this building on\nfire.\n\nPETER\nOh, that's great. I will talk to you later.\n\nHe hangs up and looks at his watch\n\n4:45. Peter looks around and sees Bill. He ducks and peeks to see Bill\ntalking with some workers. He quickly tries to save his files, but the\ncomputer is slower than he'd like. Bill is talking to other guys.\n\nPETER\nOh, come on! (it finished saving, but starts to save another file) Oh,\nfor crying out -!\n\nHe peeks over the wall again. The computer finally finished saving and\nhe turns it off. He peeks over the wall but Bill's not there. He gets\nready to leave and almost runs into Bill.\n\nBILL\nHello Peter. What's happening? Um, I'm gonna need you go ahead and come\nin tomorrow. So if you could be here around nine, that would be great.\n(starts to walk away) Oh, oh, yea\u2026I forgot. I'm gonna also need you to\ncome in Sunday too. We, uh, lost some people this week and we need to\nsorta catch up. Thanks.\n\nScene Outside the clinic. A sign says\n\nHypnotherapist; Dr. Swanson, CCS; Anxiety, Depression, Marriage, Weight\nLoss, Smoking, Insurance\n\nCut to inside. Anne is with Peter. Opposite them are Dr. Swanson and\ntwo other patients.\n\nPETER\nSo I'm sitting in my cubicle today and I realized that ever since I\nstarted working, every single day of my life has been worse than the\nday before it. So it means that every single day you see me, that's on\nthe worse day of my life.\n\nDR. SWANSON\nWhat about today? Is today the worse day of your life?\n\nPETER\nYeah.\n\nDR. SWANSON\nOh, that's bad stuff.\n\nPETER\nI'm sorry.\n\nDR. SWANSON\nOk.\n\nPETER\nBut is there any way that you, you could just sock me out so there's no\nway that I'll know I'm at work? Right here? (points to his head) Can I\njust come home and think I've been fishing all day or something?\n\nDR. SWANSON\nThat's really not what I do, Peter. However, the good news is, I think\nI can help you. I want you to do something for me, Peter. (dims the\nlights) I want you to try and relax. I want you to relax every muscle\nin your body, from your toes to your fingertips. Now I want you to\nrelax your legs. You're going to begin to feel your eyelids getting\nheavy as you slip deeper and deeper into a state of complete\nrelaxation. the air of concerns to you is disappearing. Deeper, way\ndown, your concerns about your job melts away. Way, way down. Now when\nI count backwards from three, you'll be in a state of complete\nrelaxation. your worries, cares and ambitions will be gone. And you\nwill remain in that state until I snap my fingers. Three. Deeper and\ndeeper. Way down, way down. Two. Way down. One.\n\nHe faints out of the chair and everyone rushes to his aid.\n\nANNE\nOh my God, Dr. Swanson! Ooh! Ooh! Is he dead? Oh!\n\nShe runs to get help. Peter just sits there and smiles. The hypnosis\nthing apparently worked...\n\n[Scene Peter's bedroom. Saturday morning, 8:00. His alarm clock beeps\nand he sits up. He looks at the clock and decides to go back to sleep.]\n\nCut to later. Peter's still asleep. The phone rings and the answering\nmachine picks up.\n\nBILL\nYah, hi. It's Bill Lundbergh. It's about ten o' clock, uh, wondering\nwhere you are.\n\nCut to later. Peter's still asleep. The phone rings again.\n\nBILL\nON MACHINE) YEAH, HI, IT'S BILL LUMBERGH AGAIN. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE\nSURE YOU KNEW THAT WE, UH, DID START AT THE, UH, USUAL TIME THIS\nMORNING. (PETER ROLLS OVER...) YEAH, IT ISN'T A HALF DAY OR ANYTHING\nLIKE THAT. SO IF YOU COULD GET HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, THAT WOULD BE\nTERRIFIC.\n\nCut to later. Peter finally gets up. The answering machine has\nseventeen messages. He listens to them.\n\nBILL\nYeah, hi, it's Bill Lum -\n\nNext message\n\nBILL\nYeah, it's -\n\nNext message\n\nBILL\nYeah, hi, it's Bill Lumbergh -\n\nNext message\n\nBILL\nYeah, it's me again. Uh, I was away from my desk for a minute. Just\nchecking in case you called while I was gone.\n\nThe phone rings. Peter answers it.\n\nPETER\nHello?\n\nANNE\nPeter, what's going on?!\n\nPETER\nHuh?\n\nANNE\nIt's 3:30. Why aren't you at work?!\n\nPETER\nBecause I didn't feel like it.\n\nANNE\nPeter, what is wrong with you?! First, you sit there while Dr. Swanson\ndies and you just walk out of the car and embarrass me in front of my\nfriends. Don't blame this on hypnosis either. That's total bull!\n\nPeter hangs up but Anne calls back.\n\nANNE\nANSWERING MACHINE) LISTEN, ASSHOLE. NO ONE HANGS UP ON ME. WE'RE\nTHROUGH!!! AND \u2013HA- ONE MORE THING. I'VE BEEN CHEATING ON YOU!!!! (BEEP\n\nPeter gets back into bed.\n\n[Scene Initech. Another staff meeting.]\n\nBILL\nFrom now on, you use the time sheets if you work on two or more job\ncodes and you need the extra columns to fit it all in. Otherwise, use\nthe old time sheets...\n\nTOM\nWhere's Peter? How come he didn't show up this weekend?\n\nMICHAEL\nI, I don't know.\n\nBILL\n...it would really, really help us out.\n\nMICHAEL\nPOINTS) WHO'S THAT GUY?\n\nBILL\nSo, uh, any questions?\n\n[Scene Chotchkie's. Peter enters and goes up to Joanna at the counter.]\n\nPETER\nHi, I'm Peter.\n\nJOANNA\nHi. How can I help you?\n\nPETER\nWhat are you doing for lunch today?\n\nJOANNA\nWell, our specials are barbecued chicken - it's actually right over\nthere on the board. (points) Excuse me.\n\nShe goes to take orders.\n\nBRIAN\nHey! Look who's back! Table for three, to -\n\nPeter shoves him out of his way and goes over to Joanna.\n\nPETER\nI was asking what you were doing for lunch. Would you like to have\nlunch with me?\n\nJOANNA\nOh, are you serious? Yeah, I don't , I don't think I'm supposed to do\nthat.\n\nPETER\nOh. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go next door and get a\ntable and if you'd like to join me, no big deal. All right? And if not,\nthat's cool too. Ok?\n\nHe starts to walk away.\n\nJOANNA\nUh, when you say \"next door\", do you mean Chili's or Flingers?\n\nPETER\nFlingers.\n\nJOANNA\nOk.\n\n[Scene Initech. Bob Slydell and Bob Porter are interviewing Tom.]\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nSo what you do is you take the specifications from the customers and\nyou bring them down to the software engineers?\n\nTOM\nThat, that's right.\n\nBOB PORTER\nWell, then I gotta ask, then why can't the customers just take the\nspecifications directly to the software people, huh?\n\nTOM\nWell, uh, uh, uh, because, uh, engineers are not good at dealing with\ncustomers.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nYou physically take the specs from the customer?\n\nTOM\nWell, no, my, my secretary does that, or, or the fax.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nAh.\n\nBOB PORTER\nThen you must physically bring them to the software people.\n\nTOM\nWell...no. Yeah, I mean, sometimes.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nWell, what would you say\u2026 you do here?\n\nTOM\nWell, look, I already told you. I deal with the goddamn customers so\nthe engineers don't have to!! I have people skills!! I am good at\ndealing with people!!! Can't you understand that?!? WHAT THE HELL IS\nWRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!!!!!!!\n\nCUT TO THE CUBICLES. TOM EXITS THE INTERVIEW ROOM AND MICHAEL ENTERS.\n\nCut to inside.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nLet's see. You're Michael...Bolton?\n\nHe nods.\n\nBOB PORTER\nIs that your real name?\n\nMICHAEL\nYeah.\n\nBOB PORTER\nAre you in any relation to the pop singer?\n\nMICHAEL\nIt's just a coincidence.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nLAUGHS) TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I LOVE HIS MUSIC. I DO . I AM A MICHAEL\nBOLTON FAN. FOR MY MONEY, I DON'T THINK IT GETS ANY BETTER THAN WHEN HE\nSINGS WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN.\n\nBOB PORTER\nI mean you must really love his music.\n\nMICHAEL\nYeah. Yeah\u2026he, he, he's pretty, he's pretty good, I guess.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nYou're GOD DAMN right he is.\n\nThey laugh.\n\nBOB PORTER\nSo tell me. What's your favorite song of his?\n\nMICHAEL\nHmm. I, I, I don't know. I mean, I guess, I sorta like 'em all.\n\nThe Bobs laugh.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nHA HA! I feel the exact same way, but it must be hard for you, I mean,\nhaving the same name as him. I celebrate the guy's entire catalogue.\nBut anyway, let's get down to business, Michael!\n\nMICHAEL\nYou, you know, you can just call me Mike.\n\nThey stare at him.\n\n[Scene Flingers. Peter is saving a table and Joanna enters.]\n\nJOANNA\nHi.\n\nPETER\nHey.\n\nJOANNA\nI wonder if they will let me wear this in here.\n\nPETER\nI think it would be ok. Would you like to sit down?\n\nHe motions to a chair.\n\nJOANNA\nOk. (does so) Wow. This place is really nice.\n\nPETER\nYeah, is it?\n\nJOANNA\nOh my God, compared to Chotchkie's. I like the uniforms better anyways.\n\nPETER\nI like yours.\n\nJOANNA\nNah. (makes a face\n\nPeter looks at the buttons' wearing on his suspender. One says We're\nnot in Kansas anymore. The one underneath says POOF.\n\nPETER\n\"We're not in Kansas anymore.\"\n\nJOANNA\nYeah. Really. (laughs\n\nPETER\nIt's on your - (points\n\nJOANNA\nOh! That's, uh, that's uh, my pieces of flair.\n\nPETER\nWhat are pieces of flair?\n\nJOANNA\nThat's where you know, suspenders and buttons and all sorts of stuff.\nWe're, uh, we're actually required to wear fifteen pieces of flair.\nquite stupid actually.\n\nPETER\nDo you get to pick them out yourself?\n\nJOANNA\nYeah. Yeah. Although I didn't actually choose these. I, uh, I just\ngrabbed fifteen buttons and, uh, I don't even know what they say!\nY'know, I don't really care. I don't really like talking about my\nflair.\n\nPETER\nOk.\n\nJOANNA\nSo, where do you work, uh, Peter?\n\nPETER\nInitech.\n\nJOANNA\nAnd, uh, what do you do there, Peter?\n\nPETER\nI sit in a cubicle and I update bank software for the 2000 switch.\n\nJOANNA\nNODS) WHAT'S THAT?\n\nPETER\nYou see, they wrote all this bank software and to save space, they put\n98 instead of 1998. So I go through these thousands of lines of code\nand uh, it doesn't really matter. I, uh, I don't like my job. I don't\nthink I'm gonna go anymore.\n\nJOANNA\nYou're just not gonna go?\n\nPETER\nYeah.\n\nJOANNA\nWon't you get fired?\n\nPETER\nI don't know. But I really don't like it so I'm not gonna go.\n\nJOANNA\nLAUGHS) SO YOU'RE GONNA QUIT?\n\nPETER\nNo, no, not really. I'm just gonna stop going.\n\nJOANNA\nWhen did you decide all that?\n\nPETER\nAbout a week ago.\n\nJOANNA\nReally?\n\nPETER\nOh, yeah.\n\nJOANNA\nOk. So, so you're gonna get another job?\n\nPETER\nI don't think I 'd like another job.\n\nJOANNA\nLAUGHS) SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MONEY AND BILLS?\n\nPETER\nY'know, I never really liked paying bill? I don't think I'll do that\neither.\n\nJOANNA\nLAUGHS) SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?\n\nPETER\nI want to take you out for dinner and then I wanna go to my apartment\nand watch Kung Fu. Did you ever watch Kung Fu?\n\nJoanna gets a weird look on her face.\n\nJOANNA\nI love Kung Fu...\n\nPETER\nChannel 39.\n\nJOANNA\nTotally...\n\nPETER\nYou should come over and watch Kung Fu tonight.\n\nJOANNA\nOk...\n\nPETER\nGreat.\n\nJOANNA\nOk. Can we order lunch first?\n\nPETER\nYeah.\n\nJOANNA\nOk.\n\n[Scene Milton's cubicle. He hears bill talking and eavesdrops.]\n\nBILL\n...stapler off my desk...\n\nMilton puts his Swingline stapler somewhere else. The guys laugh.\n\nBILL\n...anyway, sounds great, Bob. I'll see you in a few. (they walk off)\nHey, Milton, what's happening?\n\nMILTON\nUh...sir...\n\nBILL\nUh, I'm going to have to ask you to move your desk. Now, if you could\nget it to go as far back against that wall as possible, that would be\ngreat.\n\nMILTON\nNo, no, because I was, I was -\n\nBILL\nThat way, we'll have some room for more boxes and things we need to put\nin here.\n\nMILTON\nNo...sir...\n\nBILL\nUh (sees the Swingline) Oh there it is.\n\nMILTON\nNo. No.\n\nBILL\nLet me just get that from ya. (picks it up) Great. So if you could get\nto that as soon as possible, that would be terrific. Have a nice lunch,\nMilton. Bye.\n\nHe walks off.\n\nMILTON\nOk. I'll set the building on fire.\n\n[Scene Hallway at Initech. Peter enters in casual clothes. Milton walks\nup to him.]\n\nMICHAEL\nPeter!\n\nPETER\nMichael!\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat the hell's going on, man? I thought you were going to come in here\nand start shooting.\n\nPETER\nI just came to get my address book. I'm not gonna stay. I've got a\nnumber I don't wanna lose.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat?! Peter, you're in deep shit! You were supposed to come in on\nSaturday. What were you doing?\n\nPETER\nMichael, I did nothing. I did absolutely nothing and it was everything\nthat I thought it could be.\n\nMICHAEL\nWell, I hope you have a better story than that for Lumbergh. You know,\nyou're supposed to be having your interview right now with the\nconsultants.\n\nPETER\nWho?\n\nHe writes down Joanna's number.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat has gotten into you?\n\nPETER\nOh yeah. Right.\n\nMICHAEL\nPeter, Peter you, gotta postpone it man. Tell them you were sick. Make\nsomething up.\n\nPETER\nAh, no way. I feel great.\n\n[Scene The interview room.]\n\nBOB PORTER\nThe next paper looks like a Peter Gibbons.\n\nPeter enters.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nAha! All right. We were just talking about you. You must be Peter\nGibbons. Uh huh. Terrific. I'm Bob Slydell and this is my associate,\nBob Porter.\n\nPETER\nHi, Bob. Bob.\n\nBOB PORTER\nWhy don't you grab a seat and join us for a minute?\n\nHe does so.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nY'see, what we're trying to do here, we're just trying to get a feel\nfor how people spend their day. So, if you would, would you just walk\nus through a typical day for you?\n\nPETER\nYeah.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nGreat.\n\nPETER\nWell, I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late. I use the side\ndoor, that way Lumbergh can't see me. Uh, and after that, I just sorta\nspace out for about an hour.\n\nBOB PORTER\nSpace out?\n\nPETER\nYeah. I just stare at my desk but it looks like I'm working. I do that\nfor probably another hour after lunch too. I'd probably, say, in a\ngiven week, I probably do about fifteen minutes of real, actual work.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nUh, Peter, would you be a good sport and indulge us and tell us a\nlittle more?\n\nPETER\nLet me tell you something about TPS reports...'\n\nCut to later. Peter is more relaxed.\n\nPETER\nThe thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy. It's just that I just don't\ncare.\n\nBOB PORTER\nDon't, don't care?\nPETER\nIt's a problem of motivation, all right? Now, if I work my ass off and\nInitech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime. So where's\nthe motivation? And here's another thing, Bob. I have eight different\nbosses right now!\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nI beg your pardon?\n\nPETER\nEight bosses.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nEight?\n\nPETER\nEight, bob. So that means when I make a mistake, I have eight different\npeople coming by to tell me about it. That's my real motivation - is\nnot to be hassled. That and the fear of losing my job, but y'know, Bob,\nit will only make someone work hard enough not to get fired.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nBear with me for a minute.\n\nPETER\nOk.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nBelieve me, this is hypocritical. But what if you were offered some\nkind of stock option and equity sharing program?\n\nPETER\nI don't know. I guess. Listen, I'm gonna go. It's been really nice\ntalking to be of you guys.\n\nHe shakes their hands.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nAbsolutely. It's all on this side of the table, trust me.\n\nPETER\nGood luck with your layoffs. I hope your firings go really well.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nWow.\n\nCut to the cubicle's. Peter walks past them and into the hall.\n\nBILL\nHey, Peter, what's happening? Listen, uh -\n\nPeter walks right past him.\n\n[Scene Chotchkie's]\n\nSTAN\nJoanna? Would you come here for a moment, please?\n\nJOANNA\nI'm sorry. I was late. I was having lunch.\n\nSTAN\nI need to talk about your flair.\n\nJOANNA\nReally? I have 15 buttons on. I, uh, (shows him\n\nSTAN\nWell, ok, 15 is minimum, ok?\n\nJOANNA\nOk.\n\nSTAN\nNow, it's up to you whether or not you want to just do the bare\nminimum. Well, like Brian, for example, has 37 pieces of flair. And a\nterrific smile.\n\nJOANNA\nOk. Ok, you want me to wear more?\n\nSTAN\nLook. Joanna.\n\nJOANNA\nYeah.\n\nSTAN\nPeople can get a cheeseburger anywhere, ok? They come to Chotchkie's\nfor the atmosphere and the attitude. That's what the flair's about.\nIt's about fun.\n\nJOANNA\nOk. So, more then?\n\nSTAN\nLook, we want you to express yourself, ok? If you think the bare\nminimum is enough, then ok. But some people choose to wear more and we\nencourage that, ok? You do want to express yourself, don't you?\n\nJOANNA\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nSTAN\nGreat. Great. That's all I ask.\n\nJOANNA\nOk.\n\n[Scene Conference room. Dom and Bill are talking to the two Bob's.]\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nRight. So there's three more people we can easily lose. There's Tom\nSmykowski.\n\nBILL\nHe's useless.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nGone.\n\nDOM\nSounds good to me.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nHere's a peculiar one. Milton Waddams.\n\nDOM\nWho's he?\n\nBOB\nYou know, squirrely looking guy, mumbles a lot.\n\nDOM\nOh.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nWe can't find a record of him being a current employee here.\n\nBOB PORTER\nI looked into it more deeply and I found what happened was he got layed\noff about five years ago and no one ever told him about it. But through\na glitch in Payroll, he still gets a paycheck. I went ahead and fixed\nthe glitch.\n\nBILL\nGreat.\n\nDOM\nSo, um, Milton has been let go.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nJust a second there, Professor. We, uh, we fixed the glitch. So he\nwon't be receiving a paycheck anymore. So it'll just work itself out\nnaturally.\n\nBOB PORTER\nWe always like to avoid confrontation whenever possible. The problem is\nsolved from here on, then.\n\nThey laugh.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nUh, we should move on to a Peter Gibbons. I had a chance to meet this\nyoung man and boy does he have Straight to Upper Management written all\nover him.\n\nBILL\nOoh, uh, yeah. I'm going to have to go ahead and sort of disagree with\nyou there. Yeah. Uh, he's been real flaky lately and I'm not sure that\nhe's the caliber person you want for upper management. He's been having\nsome problems with his TPS reports.\n\nBOB PORTER\nI'll handle this. We feel that the problem isn't with Peter.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nUm-um.\n\nBOB PORTER\nIt's that you haven't challenged him enough to get him really\nmotivated.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nThere it is.\n\nBILL\nYeah, I'm not sure about that now.\n\nBOB PORTER\nAll right, Bill. Let me ask you this. How much time each week would you\nsay you deal with these TPS reports?\n\nBILL\nYeah...\n\n[[Scene Peter parks in Bill's usual spot and goes into the building. He\ntakes a drill and removes the metal door handle.]\n\nCut to outside, where Bill has to park in the handicap spot.\n\nCut back inside. Peter tears down the banner.\n\nCut to outside. Bill's Porsche is being towed away. They only manage to\npull off the bumper.\n\nCut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu. They're about to kiss.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHey Peter man! Check out channel nine! It's a breast exam! Whoo!!\n\nCut to Peter's cubicle. Bill checks his watch because Peter's still not\nthere.\n\nCut to a lake. Lawrence, Peter and Joanna are fishing. Peter holds up a\nbig fish.\n\nCut to Initech. Peter enters with an Igloo cooler.\n\nDOM\nHello, Peter.\n\nPETER\nHey Dom!\n\nHe slaps him on the back.\n\nCut to Peter's cubicle. He puts the fish on his desk and starts to gut\nit. He throws its entrails on a stack of TPS reports.\n\nCut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu.\n\nCut to Peter removing the screws in the cubicle wall. He pushes it\nover. It reveals a window and Peter relaxes.\n\n[Scene Peter's cubicle, now with only one wall. he's playing Tetris as\nBill walks up.]\n\nBILL\nSo, Peter, what's happening? Now are you going to go ahead and have\nthose TPS reports for us this afternoon? (Peter keeps playing) Uh,\nyeah. So I guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk,\nhmm?\n\nPETER\nNot right now, Lumbergh. I'm, I'm kinda busy. In fact, I'm going to\nhave to ask you to go ahead and just come back another time. I have a\nmeeting with the Bobs in a couple of minutes.\n\nBILL\nUh, I wasn't aware of a meeting with them.\n\nPETER\nYeah, they called me at home.\n\nBILL\nThat sounds good, Peter. Uh, and we'll go ahead and, uh, get this all\nfixed up for you later.\n\n[Scene Milton's cubicle. He's organizing papers.]\n\nMILTON\nF...C...P...\n\nBILL\nHi, Milton. What's going on?\n\nMILTON\nI, I, I, I, I didn't receive my paycheck this week.\n\nBILL\nUh, you're gonna have to talk to Payroll about that.\n\nMILTON\nI, I did and they, and they said -\n\nBILL\nUh, we're gonna need to move your desk downstairs into Storage B.\n\nMILTON\nNo...I...I...\n\nBILL\nUh, we have some new people coming in and we need all the space we can\nget.\n\nMILTON\nNo...no...no...no...but...but...but...I, I, I -\n\nBILL\nAnd if you could could go ahead and get a can of psticide and take care\nof the roach problem we've been having that would be great. (He walks\naway.\n\nMILTON\nI can't...Excuse me. I believe you have my stapler?\n\n[Scene The meeting between Peter and the two Bobs.]\n\nBOB PORTER\nIt looks like you've been missing a lot of work lately.\n\nPETER\nI wouldn't say I've been missing it, Bob.\n\nThey laugh.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nThat's terrific, Peter. I,I, I'm sure you've, you've, you've heard some\nof the rumors around the hallway about how we're just going to do a\nlittle (finger quotes) housecleaning with some of the software people.\n\nPETER\nWell, Bob, I have heard that and you gotta do what you gotta do.\n\nBOB PORTER\nWell, these people here. First, Mr. Samir Naga...Naga...\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nNaga...\n\nBOB PORTER\nNaga-worker here anyway!\n\nThe Bobs laugh.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nMr. Mike Bolton. We're certainly gonna miss him.\n\nPETER\nYou're gonna layoff Samir and Michael!?\n\nBOB PORTER\nWe're gonna bring in some entry level graduates for us to work in\nSingapore, that's the usual deal.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nWell, it's standard operating procedure.\n\nPETER\nDo they know about this yet?\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nNo! No, of course not. We always find it's better to fire people on a\nFriday. It's statistically shown that there's less chance of an\nincident if we do it at the end of the week. Anyway, Peter, what we\nwould like to do is put you into a position where you would have as\nmany as four people working right underneath you.\n\nBOB PORTER\nThis is a big promotion, Pete.\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nHuge.\n\nPETER\nSo you're gonna fire Samir and Michael and give me more money?\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nUmm-hmm.\n\nPETER\nWow!\n\n[Scene Michael is messing with the printer.]\n\nMICHAEL\nYeah. Yeah. That's it. That's exactly what I need. Just give it to me.\nCome on. Come on, you little fucker. Let's go! That's what I need.\nLet's do that. Let's do exactly that, you little, fu-\n\nPeter walks up to him.\n\nPETER\nListen... Well, what are you doing tonight?\n\n[Scene Peter's place. Michael, Samir and Peter are there.]\n\nPETER\nThere comes a place in a man's life and, uh, maybe that time for you is\nnow, when it doesn't hurt to think about the future.\n\nMICHAEL\nUh, no offense, there, Peter, but think about yourself, sport. You're\nthe one who's been flaking out at work. Whatever that religious\nexperience or whatever the hell it was, you better snap out of it, or\nyou're gonna get canned.\n\nPETER\nYeah. I, I, I...Listen, that virus you're always talking about. The one\nthat, that could rip off the company for a bunch of money...\n\nMICHAEL\nYeah? What about it?\n\nPETER\nWell, how does it work?\n\nMICHAEL\nIt's pretty brilliant. What it does is where there's a bank\ntransaction, and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in\nfractions of a cent, which it usually rounds off. What this does is it\ntakes those remainders and puts it into your account.\n\nPETER\nThis sounds familiar.\n\nMICHAEL\nYeah. They did this in Superman III.\n\nPETER\nYeah. What a good movie.\n\nMICHAEL\nA bunch of hackers did this in the 70s and one of them got busted.\n\nPETER\nWell, so they check for this now?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, you see, Initech's so backed up with all the software we're\nupdating for the year 2000, they'd never notice.\n\nPETER\nYou're right. And even if they wanted to, they could never check all\nthat code.\n\nMICHAEL\nIt's numbers up their asses.\n\nPETER\nSo, Michael, what's to keep you from doing this?\n\nMICHAEL\nIt's not worth the risk. I got a good job.\n\nPETER\nWhat if you didn't have a good job?\n\n[Scene A bar. Michael and Peter are there.]\n\nMICHAEL\nCockos! Samir and I are the best programmers in that place. And you,\nyou haven't even been showing up and you get to keep your job.\n\nPETER\nActually, I'm being promoted.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat?!!!\n\nPETER\nYeah, I know, Michael. It's completely unfair. And I realized something\ntoday. It's not about me and my dream of doing nothing. It's about all\nof us together. I don't know what happened at that hypnotherapist the\nother day; maybe it was just shock. It's wearing off now, but when I\nsaw that fat man keel over and die, Michael, I realized that we don't\nhave a lot of time on this earth. We weren't meant to spend it this\nway. Human beings weren't meant to sit in little cubicles, starring at\ncomputer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to\neight different bosses drone on about mission statements.\n\nMICHAEL\nI told those fudge-packers that I like Michael Bolton's music. God.\n\nPETER\nthat is not right, Michael. For five years now, you've worked your ass\noff at Initech, hoping for a promotion or some kind of profit sharing\nor something. Five years of your mid-20s now, gone. And you're gonna go\nin tomorrow and they're gonna throw you out into the street. You know\nwhy? So Bill Lumbergh's stock will go up a quarter of a point. Michael,\nlet's make that stock go down. Let's take enough money from that place\nthat we never ever have to sit in a cubicle ever again. Your software\nworks right?\n\nMICHAEL\nOf course it works. That's not the point. Look, even if it could work,\nI don't know how to install it. I don't know the credit union software\nloan.\n\nPETER\nYeah? But Samir does.\n\n[Scene Peter's apartment. Samir's there, along with Michael and Peter.]\n\nSAMIR\nBut that's not much money, I -\n\nPETER\nThat's the beauty of it. Each withdrawal is a fraction of a cent.\nThat's too small to notice. Take a thousand withdrawals a day, space it\nout over a few years, that's a couple hundred thousand dollars.\n\nMICHAEL\nJust like Superman III.\n\nSAMIR\nSuperman III - that's it, I have to leave now, ok? (gets up) I have to\nget my resume ready.\n\nPETER\nGet your resume ready for what? Another job where they can fire you for\nno reason?\n\nSAMIR\nThat's right! If I'm lucky.\n\nPETER\nLook, I don't know about you guys, but I'm tired of being pushed\naround. Aren't you?\n\nSAMIR\nYes, Peter, but I'm not going to do something illegal.\n\nPETER\nIllegal? Samir, this is America! Come on, sit down! Come on! This isn't\nRiyadh! They're not gonna saw your hands off, all right? The worse they\ncan do is put you for a couple of months into a while collar, minimum\nsecurity resort! Shit, we should be so lucky! Did you know they have\nconjugal visits there?\n\nSAMIR\nReally.\n\nPETER\nYes.\n\nMICHAEL\nShit, I'm afraid. I haven't had a conjugal visit in six months.\n\nSAMIR\nSo what do you think?\n\nMICHAEL\nThis thing actually is pretty fail-safe, Samir.\n\nPETER\nYou came here looking for a land of opportunity. And this is the knock\nof that opportunity. Tomorrow's your last day at Initech. You have two\noptions\n\nunemployment or early retirement. What's it gonna be?\n\nSAMIR\nI have a question.\n\nPETER\nYes.\n\nSAMIR\nIn, in these conjugal visits, you can have sex with women?\n\nPETER\nYep. You sure can.\n\nSAMIR\nOk. I'm gonna do it.\n\nPETER\nThat's what I'm talking about! I'm talking about America!!\n\nMICHAEL\nPeter Let's discuss the plan, all right?\n\nPETER\nAll right.\n\nMICHAEL\nAll right. It works like a computer virus. All right? So all we have to\ndo is load it anywhere into the credit union mainframe and it'll do the\nrest.\n\nPETER\nOk, you guys give me that disk and I'll take it from there. Oh, but\nlisten. Before we go any further, all right, we have to swear to God,\nAllah, that nobody knows about this, all right? No family members, no\ngirlfriends, nobody!\n\nSAMIR\nOf course.\n\nMICHAEL\nAgreed.\n\nLAWRENCE\nDon't worry man! I won't tell anybody about this either!\n\nMICHAEL\nWho the fuck is that?!\n\nPETER\nUh, don't worry about him. He's cool. All right. Now here's how I see\nit all going down...\n\n[Scene Initech. Peter shakes the Bobs' hands.]\n\nBOB SLYDELL\nPeter, congratulations. This is one heck of a promotion.\n\nBOB PORTER\nAnd we'll go ahead and get some people under you right away.\n\n(They give a thumbs up.\n\n[Scene Samir and Michael's cubicle. They look at each other. Michael\ncopies the virus and looks around. He gives it to Samir. Samir walks by\nPeter and gives it to him. He puts it into his computer and copies the\nfile. He goes to Samir and Michael's cubicle.]\n\nMICHAEL\nWell, that was easy.\n\nPETER\nYeah, I guess it was.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat did you do with the -\n\nDREW\nHey guys.\n\nPETER\nOh, hey Drew.\n\nDREW\ndid you guys hear about Tom Smykowski?\n\nMICHAEL\nThe guy who got laid off?\n\nDREW\nNo, man, check this out.\n\n[Flashback. Tom's getting drunk in his kitchen.]\n\nDREW\nV/O) LAST WEEK, AFTER HE FOUND OUT HE WAS GETTING LAID OFF, HE TRIES TO\nKILL HIMSELF BY RUNNING THE CAR IN THE GARAGE.\n\nCut to Tom in his car.\n\nMICHAEL\nV/O) IS HE DEAD?!\n\nDREW\nV/O) BUT THAT WIFE OF HIS COMES HOME EARLY FROM WORK EARLY AND FOUND\nHIM IN THE CAR AND TRIES TO PLAY IT OFF AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.\n\nTOM\nCOUGH) I WAS HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH THE SHIFTER HERE. IT'S JAMMED. I,\nI COULDN'T GET IT INTO DRIVE. I, I, I MEAN, REVERSE.\n\nMRS. SMYKOWSKI\nAre you ok, Tom?\n\nTOM\nYeah.\n\nDREW\nV/O) AND THEN, AS HE'S LOOKING AT HER, HE DECIDES HE WANTS TO LIVE.\n\nTOM\nI'm ok.\n\nMRS. SMYKOWSKI\nRight.\n\nTOM\nIt seems to be working now. See ya later, honey. Love ya.\n\nHe backs out.\n\nDREW\nV/O) BUT THEN AS HE BACKS OUT INTO HIS DRIVEWAY, HE'S SLAMMED BIG TIME\nBY A DRUNK DRIVER.\n\nWe hear a bang from behind the closing garage door.\n\nCut back to Initech, present.\n\nPETER\nWell, is he ok?\n\nDREW\nSort of. He broke both his wrists, his legs, a couple of ribs, his\nback. But check it out. He's gonna get a huge settlement out of this.\nLike seven figures. He's getting out of the hospital this weekend and\nhe's throwing a big party to celebrate. I'm thinking I'm gonna take\nthat new chick from Logistics. I might be showing her my O face. Oh!\nOh! Oh! you know what I'm talking about. Oh! Yeah. Right. See you guys\nthere.\n\n[Scene Peter's car. Samir and Michael are with him.]\n\nMICHAEL\nWow, our last day at Initech.\n\nSAMIR\nI can't believe they had security escort us out. Not like we're gonna\nsteal something.\n\nPETER\nI stole something.\n\nMICHAEL\nOh yeah. I guess we all did.\n\nPETER\nNo, I stole something else.\n\nSAMIR\nWhat did you steal?\n\nPETER\nWe'll call it a going away present.\n\n[Scene A field. They drop the printer. Samir stomps on it four times\nand Michael, eight times. Peter hands Samir a bat. He hits the printer\ntwice and Michael takes over. He starts to punch it. Samir and Peter\npull him away, but he runs back to destroy the evil printer.]\n\nCut to Peter's place. Samir's trying to break dance.\n\n[Scene Outside Peter's place.]\n\nPETER\nEverything is going to be ok. Ok?\n\nSAMIR\nThe one I see is -\n\nPETER\nI can see this working. I gotta go. I gotta go. Joanna's coming over.\nDon't worry! You're worrying! All right? Monday morning we're gonna\ncheck the account balance and everything will be all right. Don't miss\nTom's barbecue. I'll see you there.\n\nPeter goes inside.\n\nSAMIR\nRAPPING) BACK UP IN YOUR ASS WITH THE RESURRECTION...\n\n[Scene Peter's place, morning. Joanna sees all the empty liquor\nbottles.]\n\nJOANNA\nHey, what were you guys celebrating last night?\n\nPETER\nUm, I'm not really at liberty to talk about it. I really can't.\n\n[Scene Peter's car. He and Joanna are going to the barbecue.]\n\nPETER\nSo when the subroutine compounds the interest, right, it uses all these\nextra decimals places that just get rounded off. So we just simplify\nthe whole thing and we just round it down and drop the remainder into\nan account that we own.\n\nJOANNA\nSo you're stealing.\n\nPETER\nAh, no. No. You don't understand. It's, uh, very complicated. It's, uh,\nit's, it's aggregate so I'm talking about fractions of a cent that, uh,\nover time, they add up to a lot.\n\nJOANNA\nOk. So you're gonna make a lot of money, right?\n\nPETER\nYeah.\n\nJOANNA\nOk. That's not yours?\n\nPETER\nWell, it, it becomes ours.\n\nJOANNA\nHow's that not stealing?\n\nPETER\nI don't think, I don't think I'm explaining this very well. Um, this\nSeven Eleven, right? If you take a penny from the tray -\n\nJOANNA\nFrom the crippled children?!\n\nPETER\nNo, that's the tray. I'm talking about the tray. The penny's for\neverybody.\n\nJOANNA\nOh, for everybody. Ok.\n\nPETER\nYeah, well, those are whole pennies.\n\nJOANNA\nYeah.\n\nPETER\nRight. I'm just talking about fractions of a penny here, but we do it\nfrom a much bigger tray. A couple of million times. So what's wrong\nwith that?\n\nJOANNA\nIt seems wrong.\n\nPETER\nIt's not wrong. Initech is wrong. Initech is an evil corporation, all\nright? Chotchkie's is wrong. Doesn't it bother you that you have to get\nup in the morning and put on pieces of flair?\n\nJOANNA\nYeah, but I'm not about to go in and start taking money from the\nregister!\n\nPETER\nYou know, the Nazis had pieces of flair but they made the Jews wear\nthem.\n\nJOANNA\nWhat?!\n\nPETER\nLook, we don't - I, I - we don't have to talk about this. Let's just go\nto the barbecue, all right?\n\nJOANNA\nOk.\n\n[Scene Tom's house. Samir and Michael open the front door. tom is in a\nfull body cast and is hooked up to a bunch of stuff.]\n\nTOM\nMichael! Samir! How are you doing?\n\nMICHAEL\nHiya Tom.\n\nSAMIR\nHi Tom.\n\nTOM\nYeah, I'd like you to meet my lawyer, Rob Newhouse. (they shake hands)\nRob, Michael.\n\nROB\nHello Michael.\n\nTOM\nSamir.\n\nROB\nHello -\n\nSAMIR\nSamir.\n\nROB\n...Samir.\n\n(Peter and Joanna enter.\n\nTOM\nPeter!! How are ya? I'm glad you could make it.\n\nPETER\nTom! Hi! This is someone I'd like you to meet. This is Joanna.\n\nJOANNA\nHi.\n\nTOM\nHi. Forgive me for not getting up. (He starts laughing and everyone\njoins in nervously) Ooh...Ooh... Uh, Peter, Peter, come here a minute.\nI want to show you something.\n\nThey go into the kitchen. There's a Jump to Conclusions mat. It says\n??? ; Jump Again ; Strike Out ; Could be ; Loose one Turn ; Yes! ; No!\n; Accept it ; Go wild ; One step back ; Think Again ; Moot! On the\nbottom are footprints, under the word Start\n\nTOM\nWell, what do you think? It's a prototype.\n\nPETER\nWell, that's exactly as you described it. Uh, listen, I, I heard about\nyour settlement. Congratulations.\n\nTOM\nWell, thanks, Peter. y'know, I'm glad you're here because I wanted to\ntalk to you. I know how you get depressed about your job and all, and I\njust wanted you to know that's how you feel. I used to be the same way.\n\nPETER\nReally?\n\nTOM\nSure. Oh maybe I didn't whine as much, but I hated my job as much as\nyou and I've been doing good for over thirty years!\n\nPETER\nWow.\n\nTOM\nJust remember\n\nIf you hang in there long enough, good things can happen. I mean, look\nat me.\n\nHe laughs.\n\nPETER\nThanks Tom.\n\nTOM\nAw, sure.\n\n[Scene The backyard. Samir and Michael are talking to Rob.]\n\nROB\nConjugal visits? Not that I know of. Now, a minimum security prison is\nno picnic. I have a client in there right now. You see, the trick is,\nkick someone's ass the first day or become someone's bitch. Then\neverything will be all right. Why do you ask, anyway?\n\nMICHAEL\nOh, no, we were just seeing -\n\nHis cup flies out of his hand and ice cubes go everywhere.\n\nCut to Peter and Drew.\n\nDREW\nHey Peter.\n\nPETER\nDrew.\n\nDREW\nThat's something about old Tom Smykowski, huh?\n\nPETER\nYeah.\n\nDREW\nLucky bastard. (sees Joanna) Hey, isn't that the girl who works over at\nChotchkie's?\n\nPETER\nYeah.\n\nDREW\nHmm, who's she here with?\n\nPETER\nShe's here with me.\n\nDREW\nReally?\n\nPETER\nYeah.\n\nDREW\nAll right, Peter! Ooh! Ooh! Right on. Make sure you wear a rubber,\ndude.\n\nPETER\nWhy's that, Drew?\n\nDREW\nAre you kidding me? She gets around, all right?\n\nPETER\nShe does, does she?\n\nDREW\nOh yeah. Like a record.\n\nJoanna waves.\n\nPETER\nWith who?\n\nDREW\nWell, let's see. Lumbergh fucked her. Ah, let me see who else...\n\nPETER\nLumbergh?!\n\n[Scene Peter's car. He and Joanna are leaving the party.]\n\nJOANNA\nOh, what if you get caught? Oh, I, I, I, I just don't know if this is\nsuch a good idea.\n\nPETER\nANGRY) YEAH? WELL, MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO SLEEP\nWITH LUMBERGH!\n\nJOANNA\nWhat?! What are you - Oh! All right, Lumbergh...\n\nPETER\nARGH!!! AH GOD! LUMBERGH!!\n\nJOANNA\nPeter! What is wrong with you? That was like to years ago! What, do you\nknow him?\n\nPETER\nYeah, I know him!! I know him! He's my boss!! He's my unholy,\ndisgusting, pig of a boss!!\n\nJOANNA\nOh, he's not that disgusting.\n\nPETER\nHe represents all that is solace and wrong! And you slept with him!\n\nJOANNA\nThat is none of your business, ok? I didn't ask you who you slept with\nbefore we were together. I don't care!\n\nPETER\nWell, I didn't think you would sleep with a guy like Lumbergh!\n\nJOANNA\nListen to you! Who do you think you are? How dare you judge! Do you\nthink you're an angel or something? No! You're this petty, stealing,\nwannabe criminal...man!\n\nPETER\nWell, I may be. But at least I never slept with Lumbergh!!\n\nJOANNA\nOk. That's it. I'm done. I want to get out of the car. Stop. I wanna\nget -\n\nPETER\nFine.\n\nHe stops and Joanna gets out.\n\nJOANNA\nWhy don't you call me when you grow up? Oh, wait, that's probably never\ngonna happen so just don't call me, all right?\n\nPETER\nSay hello to Lumbergh for me!!!\n\nShe slams the door and he drives off.\n\n[Scene Peter's room. He's having nightmares again.]\n\nDREW\nLumbergh fucked her...Lumbergh fucked her...Lumbergh fucked her...\n\nBILL\nOh that's great\u2026great\u2026\n\nDREW\nI'm gonna see the O-face again. Oh! Oh! Oh! Ooh! Ooh!\n\nThat dissolves into Bill, naked, holding a foot in one hand a cup of\ncoffee in the other.\n\nBILL\nWhy don't you move it a little to the left? That's right. Great. Oh,\nhello, Peter. What's happening? Uh, could you give me those TPS reports\nASAP? Mmmkay?\n\nPeter wakes up and breathes deeply.\n\n[Scene Chotchkie's. Stan approaches Joanna.]\n\nSTAN\nJoanna?\n\nJOANNA\nYeah?\n\nSTAN\nWe need to talk. Do you know what this is about?\n\nJOANNA\nMy, uh, flair.\n\nSTAN\nYeah. Or, uh, your lack thereof. I'm counting and I only see fifteen\npieces. Let me ask you a question, Joanna.\n\nJOANNA\nUmm-hmm.\n\nSTAN\nWhat do you think of a person who only does the bare minimum?\n\nJOANNA\nHuh. What do I think? Let me tell you what I think, Stan. If you want\nme to wear thirty-seven pieces of flair like your pretty boy Brian over\nthere, then why don't you just make the minimum thirty-seven pieces of\nflair?\n\nSTAN\nWell, I thought I remember you saying you wanted to express yourself.\n\nJOANNA\nYeah. Yeah. Y'know what? I do. I do want to express myself. Ok? And I\ndon't need thirty-seven pieces of flair to do it. (gives him the\nfinger) All right? There's my flair! And this is me expressing myself.\n(holds up her hand) There it is! I hate this job! I hate this goddamn\njob and I don't need it!!\n\nShe storms out.\n\n[Scene An ATM machine. Peter gets out a receipt that says he has\n$305,326.13]\n\n[Scene Peter's car. Samir and Michael have obviously seen the\nreceipt.]\n\nSAMIR\nShit, shit, shit, shit. Son of a bitch! Shit! This is a - fuck! Son of\na bitch! Shit!\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat happened?\n\nPETER\nYou tell me, Michael, it's your software!\n\nSAMIR\nYes, it's your software!\n\nPETER\nCorporate accounting is sure as hell going to notice 305, 3 (grabs the\nreceipt) 26.13!! Michael!!\n\nMICHAEL\nOh shit! They, they probably won't notice it's gone for another two or\nthree days.\n\nPETER\nMichael! Michael! You said the thing was gonna take two years!\n\nSAMIR\nWhat happened?!\n\nPETER\nYou said the thing was supposed to work.\n\nMICHAEL\nWell, technically it did work.\n\nPETER\nNo it didn't!\n\nSAMIR\nIt did not work, Michael, ok?!\n\nMICHAEL\nOk! Ok!\n\nSAMIR\nOk?!\n\nMICHAEL\nOk! Ok! I must have, I must have put a decimal point in the wrong place\nor something. Shit. I always do that. I always mess up some mundane\ndetail.\n\nPETER\nOh! What is this fairly mundane detail, Michael?!!!!!\n\nMICHAEL\nOk quit getting pissed at me, all right? This was all your idea,\nasshole.\n\nPETER\nAll right. Ok. All right. Let's try not to get pissed off at each\nother, all right? We'll figure this thing out together, ok? And the\nfirst thing we gotta do is we gotta close that account down before it\ngets any bigger.\n\n[Scene Initech. It's Bill's 41st birthday. All the employees are\nsinging the birthday song to him in a flat monotone. He blows out the\ncandles and everyone claps.]\n\nALL\nMmm. You look terrific. (etc\n\nBILL\nAll right, Kate, you wanna get everybody started there. (he gets a\nslice of cake) Mmm. That is terrific. That is just terrific. I really,\nreally appreciate it.\n\nA slice is handed to Milton.\n\nNINA\nMilton, don't be greedy. Let's pass it along and make sure everyone\ngets a piece.\n\nMILTON\nCan I keep a piece? Because last time I was told that -\n\nNINA\nJust pass.\n\nHe does so.\n\nMILTON\nBut this, this, it, it, it's a little cake...\n\nEveryone gets a piece and Nina gets the last one. Milton has to watch\neveryone enjoy their piece.\n\n[Scene Peter's apartment. They're trying to figure out what to do.]\n\nSAMIR\nIs, is there a way to just give the money back?\n\nPETER\nWhat? We just hand them a check with the exact amount they're missing?\nI, I think they'd figure that out.\n\nSAMIR\nWell, we have to do something.\n\nMICHAEL\nMay-maybe we launder the money.\n\nPETER\nThat's a great idea. Ok, how do we do that?\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't know, I don't know. I don't even know what it means. It's\nsomething I think, I think coke dealers do.\n\nPETER\nOk. Do we know any coke dealers?\n\nMICHAEL\nMy, my cousin's a cokehead. We're in deep shit.\n\nSAMIR\nYes. We are in very, very deep shit.\n\n[Scene Milton's new \"office\" - the basement. Bill enters with a piece\nof cake.]\n\nBILL\nMilton?\n\nMILTON\nYes.\n\nBILL\nWhat's happening?\n\nMILTON\nI wanted to see you because -\n\nBILL\nSay, you know what would be a great idea?\n\nMILTON\nNo...no.\n\nBILL\nSince you're already down here, it would be great if you could get a ca\nof pesticipe and take care of the cockroach problem we've been having\nin here.\n\nMILTON\nI...I...that's really not my job and I haven't received my -\n\nBILL\nFor now, why don't you get a flashlight and a can of pesticide and -\n\nDom enters.\n\nDOM\nBill! We need you upstairs right away. Some major glitch in the\naccounting. A lot of money missing.\n\nThey go upstairs and Bill turns off the light.\n\nMILTON\nExcuse me? Excuse me? Ok, that's the last straw.\n\n[Scene Peter's place. Michael is looking up \"money laundering\" in the\ndictionary.]\n\nMICHAEL\nLAUNDERING. TO CLEAN...NO, UH, HERE IT IS. TO CHANNEL MONEY THROUGH A\nSOURCE OR BY AN INTERMEDIARY.\n\nSAMIR\nIt doesn't really help us, Michael.\n\nPETER\nOk. We're looking up money laundering in a dictionary.\n\nMICHAEL\nYeah, well, you guys can both eat my ass, ok?\n\nPETER\nMy girlfriend slept with Lumbergh, that's what I can't believe.\n\nSAMIR\nYeah, you didn't know that?\n\nMICHAEL\nIt happened two years before you moved to Atlanta.\n\nPETER\nYou mean, Ron Lumbergh, the airshow guy?\n\nMICHAEL\nYeah, who did you think she slept with, Bill? (He and Samir start\nlaughing) If she fucked him, their children would have hooves!\n\nPETER\nRon's not related to Bill, is he?\n\nSomeone rings the doorbell.\n\nMICHAEL\nWho is it?\n\nHe hides the checks while Peter goes to the door.\n\nPETER\nDon't panic. It's probably just the mailman.\n\nHe opens the door.\n\nSTEVE\nMONOTONOUSLY) HELLO SIR. MY NAME IS STEVE. I CAME FROM A ROUGH AREA. I\nUSED TO BE ADDICTED TO CRACK BUT NOW I'M OFF AND TRYING TO STAY CLEAN.\n\nPETER\nOk.\n\nSTEVE\nThat is why I am selling magazine subscriptions.\n\nPETER\nNo -\n\nSTEVE\nI was hoping you would help me out.\n\nMICHAEL\nWait, wait, wait, wait! You used to be addicted to crack?\n\nSTEVE\nYes, but not anymore.\n\nCut to later. They've got Steve in an armchair, trying to get him to\nhelp.\n\nSTEVE\nLook, I'm sorry. I do not know anything about money laundering.\n\nMICHAEL\nLook, we're not asking you if you know about money laundering, we're\njust trying to see if you can hook us up.\n\nPETER\nHe doesn't know anything, all right?\n\nSAMIR\nWait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. You just give us the name of\none drug dealer. I could talk to him. I have good networking skills.\n\nSTEVE\nNORMAL) I LIED. ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT ME BEING A CRACKHEAD WAS TO HELP\nME SELL MAGAZINES. I'M A SOFTWARE ENGINEER.\n\nPETER\nYou're a software engineer?!\n\nSAMIR\nWorking must be, must be very hard for you.\n\nSTEVE\nI made more money selling magazine subscriptions than I ever did\nworking at Initrode.\n\nMICHAEL\nHuh? You worked at Initrode?\n\nPETER\nYou can't tell anybody about any of this stuff I told you. I mean, we\nknow a lot of the same people.\n\nSTEVE\nActually, that all depends.\n\nHe holds up his clipboard.\n\nCut to later. Peter closes the door.\n\nPETER\nWhat am I going to do with forty subscriptions to Vibe ?\n\nMICHAEL\nI wish we had never done this. What are we going to do? You know what I\ncan't figure out? How is it that all these stupid, Neanderthal, Mafia\nguys can be so good at crime and smart guys like us can suck so badly\nat it?\n\nSAMIR\nWe're new to it, though. If we had more experience -\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. No. Y'know what I think? I think we're screwed. There's evidence\nall over that building to link it to us. Even if we could launder\nmoney, I wouldn't want to. If we're caught while laundering money,\nwe're not going to go to white-collar-resort-prison. No, no, no. We're\ngonna go to federal-reserve-pound-me-in-the-ass-prison.\n\nSAMIR\nI don't want to go to any prison! Why the hell did I do this?! I've\nnever done anything wrong in my whole life! We weren't thinking clearly\nbecause you told us we were losing our jobs! And look at us now, we're,\nwe're worried about going to prison!\n\nPETER\nDon't worry about it. I'll think of something.\n\nSAMIR\nAss. I'm going home. You are a very bad person, Peter.\n\nSamir and Michael leave. Peter knocks on the wall.\n\nPETER\nLawrence! You awake?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYeah, man!\n\nPETER\nYou wanna come over?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo thanks, man. I don't want you fucking up my life too!\n\n[Scene Peter's room.

And some customers - actually a line just\nhappened to be standing there, so...\n\nPETER\nI'm going to go away for awhile. Uh, to jail. Yea, about that computer\nscam, you were right\u2026it was a bad idea. I'm going to take the blame for\nit, I decided. I'm going to return the money and leave the confession\nunder Lumbergh's door. Joanna, I wanna apologize. I had no right to get\npissed off at you, Lumbergh isn't my problem. It wasn't even the right\nLumbergh. I don't know why I can't just go to work and be happy, like\nI'm supposed to like everybody else.\n\nJOANNA\nPeter, most people don't like their jobs. But you go out there and find\nsomething that makes you happy.\n\nPETER\nYeah. I may never be happy with my job. But if I could be with you, I\nthink that I could be happy with my life. But if you could give it\nanother shot, I promise, Joanna -\n\nJOANNA\nOh shut up.\n\nThey hug and kiss.\n\nBRIAN\nHey, what's going on here? Get a room you two!\n\nHe makes an annoying noise and gives them the finger.\n\nJOANNA\nI hate that guy.\n\n[Scene Initech. Peter drives up.]\n\nCut to inside. Peter sticks the envelope under the door of William\nLumbergh, Division Vice President. He walks away but frantically runs\nback and tries to get the envelope.

Mr. Lumbergh should be here\nany minute.\n\nMILTON\nMr. Lumbergh -\n\nSECRETARY\nJust go and sit at your desk.\n\nMILTON\nBut -\n\nSECRETARY\nOh?\n\nMILTON\nOk, I, I, I'm going to set the building on fire. I tell him, if I don't\nget my stapler (the secretary leaves) I'm going to have to get my\nstapler back because it is my stapler. (he goes into Mr. Lumbergh's\noffice) It's my stapler, the Swingline.

He had made himself King over all quarters, and Allah had subjected to him all His creatures; his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands. East and West had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them, Hind and Sind and Sin,[FN#141] the Holy Land, Al-Hijaz, the rich mountains of Al-Yaman and the archipelagos of India and China. Moreover, he reigned supreme over the north country and Diy\u00e1r Bakr, or Mesopotamia, and over Sud\u00e1n, the Eastern Negro land and the Islands of the Ocean, and all the far famed rivers of the earth, Sayh\u00fan and Jayh\u00fan,[FN#142] Nile and Euphrates. He sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote, to provide him with true report; and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace, with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; for he was, O Ruler of the Age, a right noble King; and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing. This mighty monarch had a son yclept Sharrkan,[FN#143] who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban. For this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater, and made him heir to the kingdom after himself. This Prince grew up till he reached man's estate and was twenty years old, and Allah subjected His servants to him, by reason of his great might and prowess in battle. Now his father, King Omar, had four wives legally married, but Allah had vouchsafed him no son by them, save Sharrkan, whom he had begotten upon one of them, and the rest were barren. Moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines, after the number of days in the Coptic year, who were of all nations; and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace. For he had built twelve pavilions, after the number of the months, each containing thirty private chambers, which thus numbered three hundred and three score, wherein he lodged his handmaids: and he appointed according to law for each one her night, when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year;[FN#144] and on this wise he abode for a length of time. Meanwhile his son Sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier; so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities. Presently, by decree of the Decreer, a handmaid among the handmaids of Omar bin Nu'uman became pregnant; and, her pregnancy being announced to the Harim, the King was informed thereof; whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, \"Haply it will be a son, and so all my offspring will be males!\" Then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness. But when the tidings came to Sharrkan, he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous; and he said, \"Verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty:\" so quoth he to himself, \"If this concubine bear a male child I will kill it:\" but he kept that intention hidden in his heart. Such was the case with Sharrkan; but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows. She was a Roumiyah, a Greek girl, by name Sofiyah or Sophia,[FN#145] whom the King of Roum and Lord of C\u00e6sarea had sent to King Omar as a present, together with great store of gifts and of rarities: she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour; and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating. Now she had served the King on the night of his sleeping with her, saying to him, \"O King! I desire of the God of the Heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me, so I may bring him up with the best of rearing, and enable him to reach man's estate perfect in intelligence, good manners and prudent bearing\"[FN#146]\u2014a speech which much pleased the King. During her pregnancy she was instant in prayer, fervently supplicating the Lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her; and Allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool.[FN#147] Now the King had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female; and in like way his son Sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same. In due time Sophia was delivered of a child, which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon. So they announced this to all present in the room, whereupon the King's messenger carried the news to him; and Sharrkan's eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy. But, after the two had departed, quoth Sophia to the midwives, \"Wait with me awhile, for I feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb.\" Then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her; and Allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child. The wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon, with forehead flower white, and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light; whereupon the mother rejoiced, as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company; and Sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy.[FN#148] The rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot; and the tidings reached Omar son of Al- Nu'uman, who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news. Then he rose and went to her and kissed her head, after which he looked at the boy; and, bending over him, kissed him, whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music; and the King gave order that the boy should be named Zau al-Mak\u00e1n and his sister Nuzhat al-Zam\u00e1n.[FN#149] They answered \"Hearing and obedience,\" and did his bidding; so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them; and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside, beyond the power of tongue to rehearse. Moreover the people of Baghdad, hearing that Allah had blessed their King with issue, decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom; and the Emirs and Wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished King Omar bin al-Nu'uman joy of his son, Zau al-Makan, and of his daughter Nuzhat al-Zaman, wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts, and dealt largesse to all, gentle and simple, who were present. After this fashion he did for four days full told, and he lavished upon Sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth; and, every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new-borns. And when four years had gone by, he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions. All this while his son Sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father, Omar son of Al-Nu'uman, having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of Nuzhat al-Zaman; and they hid the intelligence from him, until days and years had sped by, whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights. One day, as King Omar was sitting in his palace, his Chamberlains came in to him and, kissing the ground before him, said, \"O King there be come Ambassadors from the King of Roum, Lord of Constantinople the Great, and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree: if the King commend us to introduce them we will so do; and, if not, there is no disputing his behest.\" He bade them enter and, when they came in, he turned to them and, courteously receiving them, asked them of their case, and what was the cause of their coming. They kissed the ground before him and said, \"O King glorious and strong! O lord of the arm that is long! know that he who despatched us to thee is King Afr\u00edd\u00fan,[FN#150] Lord of Ionia land[FN#151] and of the Nazarene armies, the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of Constantinople, to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel, the Prince of Casarea; and the cause of this war is as follows. One of the Kings of the Arabs in past time, during certain of his conquests, chanced upon a hoard of the time of Alexander,[FN#152] whence he removed wealth past compute; and, amongst other things, three round jewels, big as ostrich eggs, from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man. Upon each were graven characts in Ionian characters, and they have many virtues and properties, amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new-born child, no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail, nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail.[FN#153] When the Arab King laid hands upon them and learned their secrets, he sent to King Afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned; and he equipped for the mission two ships, one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas, albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels, for that he was King of the Arabs, and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the King of Constantinople and they were bound to his port; nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the Great King, Afridun. The two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city, when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the Prince of Caesarea, who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships, together with the three jewels, and slew the crews. When our King heard of this, he sent an army against them, but they routed it; then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight,\u2014whereupon the King waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth[FN#154] against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army; nor would he turn back from them till he had left Caesarea, of Armenia[FN#155] in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her Prince held sway. So he sent us to the Lord of the age and the time, Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman, King of Baghdad and of Khorasan, desiring that he aid us with an army, so may honour and glory accrue to him; and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents, and of the King's grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance.\" Then the Ambassadors kissed the ground before him,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Forty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that, after the Ambassadors and retinue from the Constantinopolitan King had kissed the ground before Omar and had delivered their embassage, they brought out the presents, which were fifty damsels of the choicest from Graecia-land, and fifty Mamelukes in tunics of brocade, belted with girdles of gold and silver, each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one. The girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money. When the King saw them, he rejoiced in them and accepted them; then he bade the Ambassadors be honourably entreated and, summoning his Wazirs, took counsel with them of what he should do. Herewith rose up among them a Wazir, an ancient man, Dandan[FN#156] highs, who kissed the ground before Omar and said, \"O King, there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious, and set over it thy son Sharrkan with us as his lieutenants; and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts; first, because the King of Roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted; and, secondly, because while no enemy dareth attack our country, thine army may go forth safely and, should it succour the King of Graecia-land and defeat his foe, the glory will be thine. Moreover, the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially, when the tidings shall reach the Islands of the Ocean and the Kings of Mauritania shall hear it, they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money.\" The King pleased by the Wazir's words and approving his rede, gave him a dress of honour and said to him, \"Of the like of thee should Kings ask counsel, and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son Sharrkan command the main battle.\" Then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down; and he expounded to him the matter, telling him what the Ambassadors and the Wazir Dandan had said, and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign, enjoining him not to gainsay Dandan in aught he should do. Moreover, he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen, armed cap-\u00e0-pie and inured to onset and stress of war. Accordingly, Sharrkan arose on the instant, and chose out a myriad of horsemen, after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them, saying, \"Ye have delay of three days.\" They kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions, and provide provisions for the occasion; whilst Sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour, and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others. When the appointed three days were ended, the army drew out to the suburbs of Baghdad city;[FN#157] and King Omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the King seven parcels of money.[FN#158] Then he turned to Danden and commended to his care the army of his son; and the Wazir kissed the ground before him and answered, \"I hear and I obey;\" and lastly he charged Sharrkan that he should consult the Wazir on all occasions, which he promised to do. After this, the King returned to his city and Sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array. So they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen, besides footmen and camp followers. Then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled, whilst Sharrkan mounted horse, with the Wazir Dandan by his side, and the colours fluttering over their heads. So the host fared forth and stinted not faring, with the ambassadors preceding them, till day departed and night drew nigh, when they alighted and encamped for the night. And as soon as Allah caused the morn tomorrow, they mounted and tried on, guided by the Ambassadors, for a space of twenty days; and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious Wady well grown with trees and shrubbery. Here Sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days' halt, so they dismounted and pitched their tents, spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the Ambassadors of King Afridun pitched in the sole of the Wady.[FN#159] As for Sharrkan, he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides; he then slacked the reins of his steed, being minded to explore the Wady and to mount guard in his own person, because of his father's charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of Graecia land and in the enemy's country. So he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the Wazir Dandan, and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed, when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him, so that he could no longer urge horse with heel. Now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback; so when slumber overpowered him, he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets[FN#160] which was dense with growth; but Sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground. Then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees, and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons, Eastern and Western. He was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne'er yet shamed its sayer, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" But as he rode on, in fear of wild beasts, behold, the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of Paradise; and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men. So King Sharrkan alighted and, tying his steed to one of the trees, went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in Arabic and saying, \"Now by the crush of the Messiah, this is not well of you! but whose utters a word, I will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle[FN#161]!\" He kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold, a stream was gushing and flowing, and antelopes at large were frisking and roving, and wild cattle amid the pasture moving, and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues, and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs, even as a poet described it in these couplets,\n\n\"Most beautiful is earth in budding bloom, * When lucid waters\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    course through plain and wood:\nNo work but His th' All great, th' All glorious, * Giver of all\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    gifts, Giver of all good!\"\nAnd as Sharrkan considered the place, he saw in it a Christian Monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon.[FN#162] Through the midst of the convent passed a stream, the water flowing amongst its gardens; and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard, while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder, high bosomed virgins, as saith of them the poet in these couplets,\n\n\"The mead is bright with what is on't * Of merry maidens\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    debonnair:\nDouble its beauty and its grace * Those trooping damsels slender-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   fair:\nVirgins of graceful swimming gait * Ready with eye and lip to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ensnare;\nAnd like the tendril'd vine they loose * The rich profusion of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    their hair:\nShooting their shafts and arrows from * Beautiful eyes beyond\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  compare;\nOverpowering and transpiercing * Every froward adversaire.\"\n\nSharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest, with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white, and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright, and temple locks like the scorpion's tail; and she was perfect in essence and attributes, as the poet said of her in these couplets,\n\n\"She beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance, * And her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    straight slender stature enshamed the lance:\nShe burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red, * Where all manner of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    beauties have habitance:\nAnd the locks on her forehead were lowering as night * Whence\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    issues a dawn tide of happiest chance.\"\n\nThen Sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids, \"Come ye on, that I may wrestle with you and gravel you, ere the moon set and the dawn break!\" So each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright, and pinioned them with their girdles, and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all. Then there turned to her an old woman who was before her, and the beldam said as in wrath, \"O strumpet, cost thou glory in grounding these girls? Behold I am an old woman, yet have I thrown them forty times! So what hast thou to boast of? But if thou have the strength to wrestle with me, stand up that I may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels!\" The young lady smiled at her words, but she was filled with inward wrath, and she jumped up and asked, \"O my lady Zat al-Dawahi,[FN#163] by the truth of the Messiah, wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed, or dost thou jest with me?\"; and she answered, \"Yea,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Forty-seventh Night,\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the young lady asked Zat al-Dawahi, \"By the truth of the Messiah, wilt wrestle with me or dost jest?\", and she answered, \"Yea, I will wrestle with thee in very deed\" (Sharrkan looking on the while), the damsel cried, \"Rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do.\" When the old woman heard this, she raged with exceeding rage, and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog.[FN#164] Then she sprang to her feet, whilst the damsel stood up to her, and said, \"Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not wrestle with thee unless I be naked, Mistress whore!\"[FN#165] So she loosed her petticoat trousers and, putting her hand under her clothes, tore them off her body; then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape, girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head If ritah or a spotted snake. With this she inclined towards the damsel and said, \"Do thou as I have done.\" All this time, Sharrkan was gazing at the twain, and laughing at the beldam's loathly semblance. So the damsel leisurely rose and, taking a sash of Yamani stuff, passed it twice round her waist, then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal, smooth and rounded, and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples, as it were a bed of Nu'uman's anemones; and breasts like double pomegranates. Then the old woman leant towards her, and the two laid hold either of each, while Sharrkan raised his head Heavenwards and prayed Allah that the belle might beat the beldam. Presently the young woman get beneath the old woman; and, gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand, hoisted her off the ground with both; whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and, in so doing fell on her back arsiversy, with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine; furthermore she let fly two great farts[FN#166] one of which blew up the dust from the earth's face and the other steamed up to the gate of Heaven. Sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground. Then he arose and, baring his brand looked right and left, but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back, and said to himself, \"He lied not who named thee Lady of Calamities! Verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others.\" So he drew near them to hear what should pass between them. Then the young lady went up to the old one and, throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness, helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying, \"O my lady Zat al- Dawahi, I intended only to throw thee and not all this, but thou triedst to twist out of my hands; so laud to Allah for safety!\" She returned her no answer, but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight, leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned, with the fair damsel standing amongst them. Quoth Sharrkan to himself, \"Every luck hath its cause. Sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune; for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me.\" So he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled[FN#167] him on, when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath, which he brandished shouting the while his war cry, \"Allah is All mighty[FN#168]!\" When the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and, taking firm stand on the bank of the stream, whose breadth was six ells, the normal cubits, made one bound and landed clear on the farther side,[FN#169] where she turned and cried out with a loud voice, \"Who art thou, O thou fellow, that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime, and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host? Whence camest thou and whither art thou going? Speak sooth, for truth will stand thee in good stead, and lie not, for lies come of villein breed Doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way, that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies; for thou art now in an open plain and, did we shout but a single shout, would come to our rescue four thousand knights.[FN#170] So tell me what thou wantest; and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road, we will do so.\" When Sharrkan heard her words he replied, \"I am a stranger of the Moslems, who fared forth this night single handed, seeking for spoil; nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens; so I shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them.\" Quoth she, \"I would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it; and, as for the handmaids, by Allah, they shall never be thy spoil. Have I not told thee that to lie is villein vile?\" Quoth he, \"The wise man is he who taketh warning by others.\" Thereupon quoth she, \"By the truth of the Messiah, did I not fear that thy death would be on my hands, I would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might, but I take pity upon the stranger. So, if thou seek booty, I require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me, by thy faith, that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand, and we will wrestle, I and thou. If thou throw me, set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty; but if I throw thee, thou shalt become under my command. Swear this to me, for I fear thy treachery: indeed it hath become a common saw, 'Where Perfidy is innate there Trust is a weakly mate.' Now an thou wilt swear I will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee.\" Answered Sharrkan (and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul, \"Truly she knoweth not that I am a champion of champions\"); \"Swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding, and I will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest, 'Draw near that I wrestle with thee.' If thou throw me, I have money where withal to ransom myself; and if I throw thee, 'twill be booty and booty enough for me!\" Rejoined the damsel, \"I am content herewith!\" and Sharrkan was astounded at her words and said, \"And by the truth of the Apostle (whom Allah bless and keep!) I too am content on the other part!\" Then said she, \"Swear to me by Him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright, that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling; else mayst thou die without the pale of Al- Islam.\" Sharrkan replied, \"By Allah! were a Kazi to swear me, even though he were a Kazi of the Kazis,[FN#171] he would not impose upon me such an oath as this!\" Then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree; but he was drowned in the sea of thought, saying in himself, \"Praise be to Him who fashioned her from dirty water!\"[FN#172] Then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling, and said to her, \"Cross the stream to me;\" but she replied, \"It is not for me to come over to thee: if thou wilt, pass thou over here to me.\" \"I cannot do that,\" quoth he, and quoth she, \"O boy, I will come across to thee.\" So she tucked up her skirts and, leaping, landed on the other side of the stream by his side; whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms.[FN#173] But he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness; for he saw a shape which the Hand of Power had tanned with the dye leaves of the Jann, which had been fostered by the Hand of Beneficence and fanned by the Zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted. Then she called out to him, \"O Moslem, come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning,\" and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd, which illumined the whole place with its whiteness; and Sharrkan was dazzled by it. Then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge, she doing the like, and caught hold of her, and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms. Presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist, when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle, breeding languishment, and he fell a trembling like the Persian reed in the roaring gale. So she lifted him up and, throwing him to the ground, sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand, for his soul had lost mastery over his senses. Then she asked him, \"O Moslem! the slaying of Nazarenes is lawful to you folk; what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself?\"; and he answered, \"O my lady, thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful; for our prophet Mohammed (whom Allah bless and preserve!) prohibited the slaying of women and children, old men and monks!\" \"As it was thus revealed to your Prophet,\" she replied, \"it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy; so rise. I give thee thy life, for generosity is never lost upon the generous.\" Then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib, even women; and she said to him, \"Be not ashamed; but verily one who entereth the land of Roum in quest of booty, and cometh to assist Kings against Kings, how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib?\" \"'Twas not for lack of strength in me,\" he answered; \"nor didst thou throw me by thy force; it was thy loveliness overthrew me; so if thou wilt grant me another bout, it will be of thy courtesy.\" She laughed and said, \"I grant thee thy request: but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary, and it were only right I should loose them, for haply this next wrestling bout will be long.\" Then she went to the slave girls and, unbinding them, said to them in the tongue of Greece, \"Get ye to some safe place, till I foil this Moslem's lust and longing for you.\" So they went away, whilst Sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two. Then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers, but when he felt waist touch waist, his strength failed him; and she, waxing ware of this, lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding leven-flash, and threw him to the ground. He fell on his back,[FN#174] and then she said to him, \"Rise: I give thee thy life a second time. I spared thee in the first count because of thy Prophet, for that he made unlawful the slaying of women; and I do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood; but I charge thee, if there be in the Moslem army sent by Omar bin al-Nu'uman to succour the King of Constantinople, a stronger than thou, send him hither and tell him of me: for in wrestling there are shifts and trips, catches and holds, such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip, the hug, the feet-catch, the thigh Lite,[FN#175] the jostle and the leg-lock.\" \"By Allah, O my lady,\" quoth Sharrkan (and indeed he was highly incensed against her), \"had I been Master al-Safd\u00ed, Master Mohammed Kim\u00e1l or Ibn al-Sadd\u00ed,[FN#176] as they were in their prime, I had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest; for O my mistress, by Allah, thou hast not grassed me by thy strength, but by the blandishments of thy back parts; for we men of Mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight. But now, an thou wish, thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me, and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three: moreover I have regained my presence of mind.\" When she heard his words she said to him, \"Hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling, O vanquished one? However come on, an thou wilt; but know that this must be the last round.\" Then she bent forward and challenged him and Sharrkan did likewise, setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw: so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him, \"O Moslem, thou art now on thy mettle.\" \"Yes,\" he replied, \"thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round, after which each of us will wend a different way.\" She laughed and he laughed too;[FN#177] then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares, which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back. She laughed at him and said, \"Art thou an eater of bran? Thou are like a Badawi's bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the Father of Winds[FN#178] that droppeth before a puff of air. Fie upon thee, O thou poor thing!\" adding, \"Get thee back to the Moslem army and send us other than thyself, for thou fairest of thews; and proclaim for us, among the Arabs and Persians, the Turks and Daylamites,[FN#179] whoso hath might in him, let him come to us.\" Then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to Sharrkan, laughing, \"Parting with thee is right grievous to me, O my lord; but get thee to thy mates before dawn, lest the Knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lance points. Thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman, so how couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might and Knights?\" Sharrkan was confounded and called to her (as she turned from him making towards the convent), \"O my lady, wilt thou go away and leave the miserable stranger, the broken hearted slave of love?\" So she turned to him laughing and said, \"What is thy want? I will grant thee thy prayer.\" \"Have I set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy,\" replied he, \"and shall I return without eating of thy victual and tasting thy hospitality; I who have become one of thy servitors!\" \"None baulk kindliness save the base,\" she rejoined, \"honour us in Allah's name, on my head and eyes be it! Mount thy steed and ride along the brink of the stream over against me, for now thou art my guest.\" At this Sharrkan was glad and, hastening back to his horse, mounted and walked him abreast of her, and she kept faring on till they came to a drawbridge[FN#180] built of beams of the white poplar, hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast with hooks and padlocks. When Sharrkan looked, he saw awaiting her upon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in the wrestling bouts; and, as she came up to them, she said to one in the Greek tongue, \"Arise and take the reins of his horse and conduct him across into the convent.\" So she went up to Sharrkan and led him over, much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw, and saying to himself, \"O would that the Wazir Dandan were here with me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours.\" Then he turned to the young lady and said to her, \"O marvel of loveliness, now I have two claims upon thee; first the claim of good fellowship, and secondly for that thou hast carried me to thy home and offered me thy hospitality. I am now under thy commandance and thy guidance; so do me one last favour by accompanying me to the lands of Al-Islam; where thou shalt look upon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who I am.\" When she heard this she was angered and said to him, \"By the truth of the Messiah, thou hast proved thyself with me a man of keen wit; but now I see what mischief there is in thy heart, and how thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thy traitorous intent. How should I do as thou sayest, when I wot that if I came to that King of yours, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, I should never get free from him? For truly he hath not the like of me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls, Lord of Baghdad and of Khorasan though he be, who hath built for himself twelve pavilions, in number as the months of the year, and in each a concubine after the number of the days; and if I come to him he would not prove shy of me, for your folk believe I am lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ, 'Or those women whom your right hand shall possess as slaves.'[FN#181] So how canst thou speak thus to me? As for thy saying, 'Thou shalt look upon the braves of the Moslems,' by the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest that which is not true, for I saw your army when it reached our land, these two days ago; and I did not see that your ordinance was the ordinance of Kings, but I beheld only a rabble of tribesmen gathered together. And as to thy words, 'Thou shalt know who I am,' I did not do thee kindness because of thy dignity but out of pride in myself; and the like of thee should not talk thus to the like of me, even wert thou Sharrkan, Omar bin al- Nu'uman's son, the prowess name in these days!\" \"Knowest thou Sharrkan?\" asked he; and she answered Yes! and I know of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen; also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gain prevalence for the King of Constantinople.\" \"O my lady,\" said Sharrkan, \"I adjure thee by thy religion, tell me the cause of all this, that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth, and with whom the fault lies.\" \"Now by the virtue of thy faith,\" she replied, \"did I not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroad that I am of the daughters of Roum, I would adventure myself and sally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen and slay their leader, the Wazir Dandan and vanquish their champion Sharrkan.[FN#182] Nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby, for I have read books and studied the rules of good breeding in the language of the Arabs. But I have no need to vaunt my own prowess to thee, more by token as thou hast proved in thy proper person my skill and strength in wrestling; and thou hast learnt my superiority over other women. Nor, indeed, had Sharrkan himself been here this night and it were said to him, 'Clear this stream,' could he have done it; and I only long and lust that the Messiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent, that I might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes.\"- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Forty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Nazarene damsel said to Sharrkan (and he listening impatiently enow), \"Verily if Sharrkan fell into my hands, I would go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes,\" pride and passion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and he desired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load; but her loveliness restrained him and he began repeating,\n\n\"An faulty of one fault the Beauty prove, * Her charms a thousand advocates shall move.\"\n\nSo she went up and Sharrkan after her; and, when he saw the maiden's back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other, like rollers in the rolling sea, he extemporised these couplets:- -\n\n\"For her sins is a pleader that brow, * And all hearts its fair\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     pleading must bow:\nWhen I saw it I cried, \"To night * The moon at its fullest doth\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    show;\nTho' Balkis' own Ifrit[FN#183] try a bout, * Spite his force she\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    would deal him a throw.\"\n\nThe two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose a marble archway. This she opened and ushered Sharrkan into a long vestibule, vaulted with ten connected arches, from each of which hung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire. The handmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles of goodly perfume, and wearing on their heads golden fillets crusted with all manner bezel gems,[FN#184] and went on before her (Sharrkan still following), till they reached the inner convent. There the Moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around, one opposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered in gold. The monastery floor was paved with every kind of vari coloured marbles and mosaic work, and in the midst stood a basin that held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold, whence the water ran like molten silver; whilst at the upper end stood a throne spread with silks fit only for Kings. Then said the damsel, \"Ascend, O my lord, this throne.\" So he went up to it and sat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time. Sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him, \"She hath gone to her dormitory; but we will serve thee even as she ordered.\" So they set before him viands of rare varieties, and he ate his sufficiency, when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver, and he washed his hands. Then his thoughts reverted to his army, knowing not what had befallen it in his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten his father's injunctions: so he was troubled about his case, repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared; when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in sea of sadness and repeated,\n\n\"I am not lost to prudence, but indeed * Here I'm bewildered,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    what shall be my rede?\nWould any aid me in mine ails of love, * By my own might and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sleight would I be free'd:\nBut ah! my heart is lost and passion-shent: * To none save Allah\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  can I trust my need!\"\nWhen he ended his verse behold, there came up to him a rare show and a fair, more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassing the young lady, who shone in their midst as the full moon among the constellations guarding and girding her. She was clad in brocades befitting Kings; her breasts were like twin pomegranates, a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightly clasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips; and her hinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystal[FN#185] supporting a silvern shaft. When Sharrkan looked at her his wits went nigh to fly away from him with delight; and he forgot army and Wazir as he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work of pearls set off by divers sorts of gems. Handmaids on her right and handmaids on her left bore her train, as she paced with dainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead. He sprang to his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness, and cried aloud, \"Beware and beware of that zone rarely fair!\" and broke out into these couplets,\n\n\"With heavy back parts, high breasts delicate, * And lissome form\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   that sways with swimming gait\nShe deftly hides love longing in her breast; * But I may never\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   hide its ban and bate\nWhile hosts of followers her steps precede,[FN#186] * Like pearls\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    now necklaced and now separate.\"\n\nShe gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till she was assured of him, when she came up to him and said, \"In very sooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee, O Sharrkan! How sped thy night, O hero, after we went away and left thee?\"; adding, \"Verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful, especially in great Kings! and thou art Crown Prince Sharrkan, son and heir of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; so henceforth make no secret of thy rank and condition, nor let me hear aught from thee but the truth; for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite. And as thou art pierced by the shaft of Fate, be resignation thine and abide content to wait.\" When he heard her words he saw that artifice availed him naught and he acknowledged the truth, saying, \"I am Sharrkan, bin Omar bin al-Nu'uman, whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place; so whatso thou willest, do it in my case!\" She hung her head groundwards a long while, then turned to him and said, \"Be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool and clear;[FN#187] for thou art the guest of my hospitality, and bread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee; wherefore thou art in my ward and under my safeguard. Have no fear for, by the truth of the Messiah, if all on earth sought to do thee hurt they should not come at thee, till life had left my body for thy sake: indeed thou art now under the charge of the Messiah and of me.\" Hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing with him, till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired to slay him, she would have done so during the past night. Presently she bespoke in the Grecian tongue one of her slave girls, who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and a tray of food; but Sharrkan abstained from eating and said to himself, \"Haply she hath put somewhat in this meat.\" She knew what was in his thought; so she turned to him and said, \"By the truth of the Messiah, the case is not on such wise, nor is there aught in this meat of what thou suspectest! Had my mind been set on slaying thee, I had slain thee ere now.\" Then she walked up to the tray and ate of every dish a mouthful; where upon Sharrkan came forward and ate too. She was pleased at this and both ate till they were satisfied. They washed their hands and after that she rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs of sweet savour, wines of all colours and kinds and a wine-service with vessels of gold, silver and crystal. She filled a first goblet and drank it off before offering it to him, even as she had done with the food: then she crowned a second and handed it to him. He drank and she said to him, \"O Moslem, see how thou art here in all solace and delight of life!\" And she ceased not to drink and ply him with drink, till he took leave of his wits,- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Forty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damsel ceased not to drink and ply Sharrkan with drink till he took leave of his wits, for the wine and the intoxication of love he bore her. Presently she said to the slave girl, \"O Marjanah[FN#188]! bring us some instruments of music!\" \"To hear is to obey,\" said the hand maid and going out, returned in the twinkling of an eye with a Damascus lute,[FN#189] a Persian harp, a Tartar pipe, and an Egyptian dulcimer. The young lady took the lute and, after tuning each several string, began in gentle undersong to sing, softer than zephyr's wing and sweeter than Tasmin[FN#190] spring, with heart safe and secure from everything the couplets following,\n\n\"Allah assain those eyne! What streams of blood they shed! * How\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have sped.\nI love all lovers who to lovers show them cure; * 'Twere wrong to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   rue the love in wrong head born and bred:\nHaply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens! * Heaven help\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  the hapless heart by force of thee misled!\nThou doomest me to death who art my king, and I * Ransom with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  life the deemster who would doom me dead.\"\n\nThereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking an instrument, played and recited couplets in the Roumi tongue; then their mistress sang also and seeing Sharrkan in ecstasies asked him, \"O Moslem, dost thou understand what I say?\"; and he answered, \"Nay, my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy finger sips.\" She laughed and continued, \"If I sing to thee in Arabic what wouldst thou do?\" \"I should no longer,\" quoth he, \"be master of my senses.\" Then she took an instrument and, changing the measure, began singing these verses,\n\n\"The smack of parting's myrrh to me, * How, then, bear patience'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    alo\u00eb?\nI'm girt by ills in trinity * Severance, distance,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     cruelty!\nMy freedom stole that fairest she, * And parting irks me\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    bitterly.\"\n\nWhen she ended her verse, she looked at Sharrkan and found him lost to existence, and he lay for a while stretched at full length and prone among the maidens.[FN#191] Then he revived and, remembering the songs, again inclined to mirth and merriment; and the twain returned to their wine and wassail, and continued their playing and toying, their pastime and pleasure till day ceased illuminating and night drooped her wing. Then the damsel went off to her dormitory and when Sharrkan asked after her they answered, \"She is gone to her sleeping chamber,\" whereto he rejoined, \"Under Allah's ward and His good guard!\" As soon as it was morning, a handmaid came to him and said to him, \"My mistress biddeth thee to her.\" So he rose and followed her and, as he drew near her lodging, the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabrets and songs of greeting, and led him through a great door of ivory studded with pearls and jewels. Thence they passed with him into a tall and spacious hall, at the upper end of which was a wide dais carpeted with all kinds of silks, and round it open lattices commanding a view of trees and streams. About the saloon were figures carved in human form, and fashioned on such wise that the air passed through them and set in motion musical instruments within, so that the beholder would fancy they spoke.[FN#192] Here sat the young lady, looking at the figures; but when she saw Sharrkan, she sprang to her feet and, taking him by the hand, made him sit down by her side, and asked him how he had passed the night. He blessed her and the two sat talking awhile till she asked him, \"Knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves of love?\"; and he answered \"Yes! I wot somewhat in verse on that matter.\" \"Let me hear it,\" quoth she, so he began quoting,\n\n\"Pleasure and health, good cheer, good appetite * To Azzah,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   freest with our name and fame!\nBy Allah! would I near her off she flies * At tangent, granting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   less the more I claim:\nI dote on Azzah, but when clear I off * My rivals, clears me too\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   that dearest dame;\nLike wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud * Which, ere\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    siesta done, thin air became.\"\n\nWhen she heard this she said, \"Verily Al-Kuthayyir[FN#193] was conspicuous for sweet speech and chaste, and he was superlative in his praise of Azzah when he sang\" (and she began to recite),\n\n\"Did Azzah deal behest to Sun o' noon, * The judge had judged her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     beauty's bestest boon;\nAnd girls who come to me and carp at her, * God make their rosy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   cheeks her sandal-shoon!\n\nAnd indeed,\" quoth she, \"'twas said that Azzah boasted exceeding beauty and loveliness.\" Then she asked Sharrkan saying, \"O Prince, cost thou know aught of Jamil's[FN#194] verses to Buthaynah? if so repeat to us somewhat of them;\" and he answered, \"Yes, I know them better than any;\" whereupon he began repeating these couplets,\n\n\"Jamil, in Holy war go fight!\" to me they say: * What war save\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    fight for fair ones would I e'er essay?\nTo me their every word and work are mere delight, * And martyrs\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   crepe I all they slay in fight and fray:\nAn ask I, 'O Buthaynah! what's this love, I pray, * Which eats\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    my heart?' quoth she ' 'Twill stay for ever and aye!'\nAnd when I cry, 'Of wits return some small display * For daily\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    use,' quoth she, 'Far, far 'tis fled away!\nThou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy * While I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     no goal espy save thee and thee alway.'\"\n\n\"Thou hast spoken right well,\" said she, \"O King's son, and Jamil also spoke excellently well. But what would Buthaynah have done with him that he saith in his hemistich,\n\n'Thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy?'\"\n\n\"O my lady,\" quoth Sharrkan, \"she willed to do him what thou willest to do with me, and even that will not satisfy thee.\" She laughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing till Day put out her light and Night came in darkness dight. Then she rose and went to her dormitory and slept, while Sharrkan slept in his place till morning dawned. As soon as he awoke, the hand maids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth and merriment, as wont; and, kissing the ground between his hands, said to him, \"Bismillah! in Allah's name be so kind as to come[FN#195]: our mistress biddeth thee to her presence!\" So he rose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him, playing on tabrets and other instruments of music, till they passed from that saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall, decorated with pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts, passing all description. Sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice of the place and began reciting,\n\n\"He plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry, * And her breast-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   pearls that bedded in gold mine lie.\nPure water on silvern bars is her brow, * And her cheeks show\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     roses with rubies vie:\nMeseems in her eyne that the violet's hue * Lies purpling set in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    the Ithmid's[FN#196] dye.\"\nWhen the lady saw Sharrkan, she stood up to him in honour and,\ntaking his hand, seated him by her side and asked, \"O son of King\nOmar bin al-Nu'uman, hast thou any cunning in the game of chess?\"\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"but do not thou with me as said the poet,\n'I speak and longing love upties me and unties me; * Till with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     her honey dew of inner lip she plies me:\nI brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me * With\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    white and black,[FN#197] but black cum white ne'er satisfies\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     me:\n'Twas as if King for Castle I were fain to place me * Till wilful\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     loss of game atwixt two queens surprise me:\nAnd if I seek to read intent in eyes that eye me * Oh man! that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     glance askance with hint of wish defies me.'\"\n\nThen she brought the chessboard and played with him; but Sharrkan, instead of looking at her moves, kept gazing at her fair mouth, and putting knight in place of elephant and elephant[FN#198] instead of knight. She laughed and said to him, \"If thy play be after this fashion, thou knowest naught of the game.\" \"This is only our first,\" replied he, \"judge not by this bout.\" When she beat him he replaced the pieces in position and played again with her; but she beat him a second time, a third, a fourth and a fifth. So she turned to him and said, \"Thou art beaten in everything;\" and he replied, \"O my lady, how should one playing with the like of thee avoid being beaten?\" Then she bade bring food, and they ate and washed their hands; after which the wine was set before them and they drank. Presently, she took the dulcimer, for her hand was cunning in smiting it, and she began repeating to an accompaniment these couplets,\n\n\"Twixt the close tied and open wide no medium Fortune knoweth, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     showeth.\nThen drink her wine the syne she's thine and smiling thou dost\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     find her * Anon she'll fall and fare away when all thy good\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     forth goeth.\"\n\nThey ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day was pleasanter even than the first. When darkness set in, the lady betook her to her dormitory, leaving him alone with the hand maids; so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn, when the damsels came to him with tambourines and other instruments according to custom. Seeing them he roused him hastily and sat up; and they carried him to their mistress, who came to meet him and, taking him by the hand, seated him by her side. Then she asked him how he had passed his night, whereat he prayed that her life be prolonged; and she took the lute and sang to it these verses which she improvised,\n\n\"Ne'er incline thee to part * Which embitters the heart\nE'en the sun when he sets * Shall in pallor depart.\"\n\nWhile they were solacing themselves after this fashion, behold, there arose a great and sudden clamour, and a confused crowd of knights and men rushed in, holding drawn swords that glittered and gleamed in their hands, and cried aloud in the Grecian tongue \"Thou hast fallen into our hands, O Sharrkan, so make thee sure of death!\" When he heard this, he said to himself, \"By Allah, she hath entrapped me and held me in play, till her men should come. These are the Knights with whom she threatened me; but 'tis I who have thrown myself into this strait.\" Then he turned towards the young lady to reproach her, but saw that she had changed colour and her face was pale; and she sprang to her feet and asked the crowd, \"Who are ye?\" \"O most gracious Princess and peerless onion pearl,\" answered the leading Knight, \"dost thou weet who is yon man by thy side?\" \"Not I,\" she replied, \"who may he be?\" Quoth the Patrician, \"This is of towns the highwayman! This is he who rideth in the horseman's van! This is Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman! This is he that forceth fortalice and penetrateth every impregnable place! The news of him reached King Hardub, thy father, by report of the ancient dame Zat al- Dawahi; and thy sire, our sovereign, hath made sure that thou hast rendered good service to the army of the Greeks by taking captive this ominous lion.\" When she heard this, she looked at the Knight and asked him, \"What be thy name?\" and he answered, \"I am M\u00e1s\u00farah, son of thy slave Maus\u00farah bin K\u00e1shardah, Knight of Knights.\" \"And how?\" quoth she, \"durst thou enter my presence without leave?\" Quoth he, \"O my lady, when I came to the gate, none forbade me, neither chamberlain nor porter, but all the door keepers rose and forewent us as of wont; although, when others come, they leave them standing at the gate while they ask permission to admit them. But this is not a time for long talking, when the King is expecting our return with this Prince, the scorpion sting[FN#199] of the Islamitic host, that he may kill him and drive back his men whither they came, without the bane of battling with them.\" \"These words be ill words,\" rejoined the Princess, \"and Dame Zat al-Dawahi lied, avouching an idle thing and a vain, whereof she weeteth not the truth; for by the virtue of the Messiah, this man who is with me is not Sharrkan, nor is he a captive, but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality, and I made him my guest. So even were we assured that this be Sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is he beyond a doubt, I say it would ill befit mine honour that I should deliver into your hands one who hath entered under my protection. So make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgrace among men; but return to the King, my father, and kiss the ground before him, and inform him that the case is contrariwise to the report of the Lady Zat al-Dawahi.\" \"O Abr\u00edzah,\" replied Masurah, the Knight, \"I cannot return to the King's majesty without his debtor and enemy.\" Quoth she (and indeed she had waxed very wroth). \"Out on thee! Return to him with my answer, and no blame shall befal thee!\" Quoth Masurah, \"I will not return without him.\" Thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed, \"Exceed not in talk and vain words; for verily this man had not come in to us, were he not assured that he could of himself and single handed make head against an hundred riders; and if I said to him, 'Thou art Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman,' he would answer, 'Yes.' But 'tis not of your competence to let or hinder him; for if you do so, he will not turn back from you till he hath slain all that are in this place. Behold, here he is by my side, and I will bring him before you sword and targe in hand.\" \"Albeit I were safe from thy wrath,\" answered Masurah the Knight, \"I am not safe from that of thy father, and when I see him, I shall sign to the Knights to take him captive, and we will carry him to the King bound and in abject sort.\" When she heard this, she said, \"The matter shall not pass thus, for 'twould be blazoning mere folly. This man is but one and ye are an hundred Knights: so if you would attack him come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant amongst you.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fiftieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the Knight, \"This man is but one, and ye are an hundred: so if ye would attack him, come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant.\" Quoth Masurah, the Knight, \"By the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest sooth, and none but I shall sally out against him first.\" Quoth she, \"Wait till I go to him and acquaint him with the case and hear what answer he will make. If he consent, 'tis well; but if he refuse, ye shall on no wise come to him, for I and my hand maids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom.\" So she went to Sharrkan and told him the news, whereat he smiled and knew that she had not informed any of the Emirs; but that tidings of him had been bruited and blazed abroad, till the report reached the King, against her wish and intent. So he again began reproaching himself and said, \"How came I to adventure and play with my life by coming to the country of the Greeks?\" But hearing the young lady's proposal he said to her, \"Indeed their onset, one after one, would be overburdensome to them. Will they not come out against me, ten by ten?\" \"That would be villainy,\" said she; \"Let one have at one.\" When he heard this, he sprang to his feet and made for them with his sword and battle gear; and Masurah, the Knight, also sprang up and bore down upon him. Sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cut[FN#200] which clove him to the middle, and the blade came out gleaming and glittering from his back and bowels. When the lady beheld that swashingblow, Sharrkan's might was magnified in her sight and she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it was not by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness. So she turned to the Knights and said, \"Take wreak for your chief!\" Thereupon out came the slain man's brother, a fierce and furious Knight, and rushed upon Sharrkan, who delayed not, but smote him also with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering from his vitals. Then cried the Princess, \"O ye servants of the Messiah, avenge your comrade!\" So they ceased not charging down upon him, one after one; and Sharrkan also ceased not playing upon them with the blade, till he had slain fifty Knights, the lady looking on the while. And Allah cast a panic into the hearts of the survivors, so that they held back and dared not meet him in the duello, but fell upon him in a body; and he laid on load with heart firmer than a rock, and smote them and trod them down like straw under the threshing sled,[FN#201] till he had driven sense and soul out of them. Then the Princess called aloud to her damsels, saying, \"Who is left in the convent?\"; and they replied, \"None but the gate keepers;\" whereupon she went up to Sharrkan and took him to her bosom, he doing the same, and they returned to the palace, after he had made an end of the melee. Now there remained a few of the Knights hiding from him in the cells of the monastery, and when the Princess saw this she rose from Sharrkan's side and left him for a while, but presently came back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding in her hand a fine Indian scymitar. And she said, \"Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not be a niggard of myself for my guest; nor will I abandon him though for this I abide a reproach and a by word in the land of the Greeks.\" Then she took reckoning of the dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the Knights, and other twenty had taken to flight.[FN#202] When she saw what work he had made with them she said to him, \"Allah bless thee, O Sharrkan! The Cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee.\" Then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slain began reciting these couplets,\n\n\"How oft in the mellay I've cleft the array, * And given their\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     bravest to lions a prey:\nAsk of me and of them when I proved me prow * O'er creation, on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     days of the foray and fray:\nWhen I left in the onslaught their lions to lie * On the sands of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     the low lands[FN#203] in fieriest day.\"\n\nWhen he ended his verse, the Princess came up to him with smiles and kissed his hand; then she doffed her hauberk and he said to her, \"O lady mine, wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail and bare thy brand?\" \"To guard thee against these caitiffs,\"[FN#204] she replied. Then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them, \"How came ye to admit the King's Knights into my dwelling without leave of me?\"; and they answered, \"O Princess, it is not our custom to ask leave of thee for the King's messengers, and especially for the chief of his Knights.\" Quoth she, \"I think ye were minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest;\" and bade Sharrkan smite their necks. He did so and she cried to the rest of her servants, \"Of a truth, they deserved even more than that!\" Then turning to Sharrkan, she said to him, \"Now that there hath become manifest to thee what was concealed, thou shalt be made acquainted with my history. Know, then, that I am the daughter of King Hardub of Roum; my name is Abrizah and the ancient dame, yclept Zat al-Dawahi, is my grandmother by the sword side. She it certainly is who told my father of thee, and as surely she will compass a sleight to slay me, more by token as thou hast slain my father's chivalry and it is noised abroad that I have separated myself from the Nazarenes and have become no better than I should be with the Moslems. Wherefore it were wiser that I leave this dwelling while Zat al-Dawahi is on my track; but I require of thee the like kindness and courtesy I have shown thee, for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thine account. So do not thou neglect to do aught that I shall say to thee, remembering all this betided me not save by reason of thee.\" Hearing her words, Sharrkan joyed greatly; his breast broadened and his wits flew from him for delight, and he said, \"By Allah, none shall come at thee, while life is in my bosom! But hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thy people?\" \"Even so,\" she answered; and Sharrkan swore to her and the two plighted their troth. Then said she, \"Now is my heart at ease; but there remaineth one other condition for thee.\" \"What is it?\" asked he and she answered, \"It is that thou return with thy host to thine own country.\" Quoth he, \"O lady mine, my father, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, sent me to wage war upon thy sire, on account of the treasure he plundered from the King of Constantinople, and amongst the rest three great jewels, noted givers of good fortune.\" Quoth she, \"Cheer thy heart and clear thine eyes: I will tell thee the whole of the tale and the cause of our feud with the King of Constantinople. Know that we have a yearly festival, highs the Convent Feast, whereat Kings from all quarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate; thither also come merchants and traders with their wives and families, and the visitors abide there seven days. I was wont to be one of them; but, when there befel enmity between us, my father forbade me to be present at the festival for the space of seven years. One year, it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great who resorted to the patron, as was their custom, came a daughter of the King of Constantinople, a beautiful girl called Sophia. They tarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folk went their ways;[FN#205] but Sophia said, 'I will not return to Constantinople save by water.' So they equipped for her a ship in which she embarked with her suite; and making sail they put out to sea; but as they were voyaging behold, a contrary wind caught them and drove the vessel from her course till, as Fate and Fortune would have it, she fell in with a Nazarene craft from the Camphor Island[FN#206] carrying a crew of five hundred armed Franks, who had been cruising about a long time. When they sighted the sails of the ship, wherein Sophia and her women were, they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they came up with her, then they laid the grappling irons aboard her and captured her. Then taking her in tow they made all sail for their own island and were but a little distant from it when the wind veered round and, splitting their sails, drove them on to a shoal which lies off our coast. Thereupon we sallied forth and, looking on them as spoil driven to us by Fate,[FN#207] boarded and took them; and, slaying the men, made prize of the wreck, wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and forty maidens, amongst whom was the King's daughter, Sophia. After the capture we carried the Princess and her women to my father, not knowing her to be a daughter of King Afridun of Constantinople; and he chose out for himself ten including her; and divided the rest among his dependents. Presently he set apart five damsels, amongst whom was the King s daughter, and sent them to thy father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, together with other gifts, such as broadcloth[FN#208] and woollen stuffs and Grecian silks. Thy father accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girls Sophia, daughter of King Afridun; nor did we hear more of her till the beginning of this year, when her father wrote to my father in words unfitting for me to repeat, rebuking him with menaces and saying to him: Two years ago, you plundered a ship of ours which had been seized by a band of Frankish pirates in which was my daughter, Sophia, attended by her maidens numbering some threescore. Yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger or otherwise; nor could I make the matter public, lest reproach befal me amongst the Kings, by reason of my daughter's honour. So I concealed my case till this year, when I wrote to certain Frankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the Kings of the Isles. They replied, 'By Allah we carried her not forth of thy realm; but we have heard that King Hardub rescued her from certain pirates. And they told me the whole tale.' Then he added in the writing which he writ to my father: 'Except you wish to be at feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour my daughter, you will, the instant my letter reacheth you, send my daughter back to me. But if you slight my letter and disobey my commandment, I will assuredly make you full return for your foul dealing and the baseness of your practices.'[FN#209] When my father read this letter and understood the contents,[FN#210] it vexed him and he regretted not having known that Sophia, King Afridun's daughter, was among the captured damsels, that he might have sent her back to her sire; and he was perplexed about the case because, after so long a time, he could not send to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and demand her back from him, especially as he had lately heard that Heaven had granted him boon of babe by this Sophia. So when we pondered that truth, we knew that this letter was none other than a grievous calamity; and my father found nothing for it but to write an answer to King Afridun, making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that he knew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth how he had sent her to King Omar bin al Nu'uman, who had gotten the blessing of issue by her. When my father's reply reached King Afridun he rose up and sat down,[FN#211] and roared and foamed at the mouth crying:\u2014'What! shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girls and pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift to Kings, and they lie with her without marriage contract? By the Messiah and the true Faith,' said he, 'I will not desist till I have taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out my shame; and indeed I will do a deed which the chroniclers shall chronicle after me!' So he bided his time till he devised a device and laid notable toils and snares, when he sent an embassy to thy father, King Omar, to tell him that which thou hast heard: accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee and sent thee to King Afridun, whose object is to seize thee and thine army to boot. As for the three jewels whereof he told thy father when asking his aid, there was not one soothfast word in that matter, for they were with Sophia, his daughter; and my father took them from her, when he got possession of her and of her maidens, and gave them to me in free gift, and they are now with me. So go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they be led deep into, and shut in by, the land of the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth the Franks and the country of the Greeks; for as soon as you have come far enough into their interior, they will stop the roads upon you and there will be no escape for you till the Day of retribution and retaliation. I know that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them, because thou didst order a three days' rest; withal they have missed thee all this time and they wot not what to do.\" When Sharrkan heard her words, he was absent awhile in thought; then he kissed Princess Abrizah's hand and said, \"Praise be to Allah who hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the cause of my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me! But 'tis grievous to me to part from thee and I know not what will become of thee after my departure.\" \"Go now to thine army,\" she replied, \"and turn them back, while ye are yet near your own country. If the envoys be still with them, lay hands on them and keep them, that the case may be made manifest to you; and, after three days, I will be with you all and we will enter Baghdad together.\" As he turned to depart she said, \"Forget not the compact which is between me and thee,\" then she rose to bid[FN#212] him farewell and embrace him and quench the fire of desire, so she took leave of him and, throwing her arms round his neck, wept with exceeding weeping, and repeated these verses,\n\n\"I bade adieu, my right hand wiped my tears away, * The while my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     left hand held her in a close embrace:\n'Fearest thou naught,' quoth she, 'of shame?' I answered 'Nay, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The lover's parting day is lover's worst disgrace.'\"\n\nThen Sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent. They brought his steed, so he mounted and rode down stream to the drawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodland paths and passed into the open meadow. As soon as he was clear of the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on the alert, and he bared his brand and rode cautiously, but as they drew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them and behold, it was the Wazir Dandan and two of his Emirs. When they saw him and knew him, they dismounted and saluting him, asked the reason of his absence; whereupon he told them all that had passed between him and Princess Abrizah from first to last. The Wazir returned thanks to Almighty Allah for his safety and said,[FN#213] \"Let us at once leave these lands; for the envoys who came with us are gone to inform the King of our approach, and haply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners.\" So Sharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount, which they did and, setting out at once, they stinted not faring till they reached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay. The Ambassadors meanwhile had reported Sharrkan's approach to their King, who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and those with him. But Sharrkan, escorted by the Wazir Dandan and the two Emirs, had no sooner sighted the army, than he raised the cry \"March! March!\" They took horse on the instant and fared through the first day and second and third day, nor did they cease faring for five days; at the end of which time they alighted in a well wooded valley, where they rested awhile. Then they again set out and stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed them on the frontiers of their own country. Here, deeming themselves safe, they halted to rest; and the country people came out to them with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage for the beasts. They tarried there two days after which, as all would be making for their homes, Sharrkan put the Wazir Dandan in command, bidding him lead the host back to Baghdad. But he himself remained behind with an hundred riders, till the rest of the army had made one day's march: then he called \"To horse!\" and mounted with his hundred men. They rode on two parasangs'[FN#214] space till they arrived at a gorge between two mountains and lo! there arose before them a dark cloud of sand and dust. So they checked their steeds awhile till the dust opened and lifted, discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers, lion faced and in mail coats cased. As soon as they drew within earshot of Sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them, saying, \"By the virtue of John and Mary, we have won to our wish! We have been following you by forced marches, night and day, till we forewent you to this place. So dismount and lay down your arms and yield yourselves, that we may grant you your lives.\" When Sharrkan heard this, his eyes stood out from his head and his cheeks flushed red and he said 'How is it, O. Nazarene dogs, ye dare enter our country and overmatch our land? And doth not this suffice you, but ye must adventure yourselves and address us in such unseemly speech? Do you think to escape out of our hands and return to your country?\" Then he shouted to his hundred horsemen, \"Up and at these hounds, for they even you in number!\" So saying, he bared his sabre and bore down on them, he and his, but the Franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks, and wight dashed against wight, and knight dashed upon knight, and hot waxed the fight, and sore was the affright, and nor parley nor cries of quarter helped their plight; and they stinted not to charge and to smite, right hand meeting right, nor to hack and hew with blades bright white, till day turned to night and gloom oppressed the sight. Then they drew apart and Sharrkan mustered his men and found none wounded save four only, who showed hurts but not death hurts. Said he to them, \"By Allah, my life long have I waded in the clashing sea of fight and I have met many a gallant sprite, but none so unfrightened of the sword that smites and the shock of men that affrights like these valiant Knights!\" \"Know, O King,\" said they, that there is among them a Frankish cavalier who is their leader and, indeed, he is a man of valour and fatal is his spear thrust: but, by Allah, he spares us great and small; for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go and forbears to slay him. By Allah, had he willed he had killed us all.\" Sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the Knight had done and such high report of him, so he said, \"When the morn shall morrow, we will draw out and defy them, for we are an hundred to their hundred; and we will seek aid against them from the Lord of the Heavens.\" So they rested that night in such intent; whilst the Franks gathered round their Captain and said, \"Verily this day we did not win our will of these;\" and he replied, \"At early dawn when the morrow shall morn, we will draw out and challenge them, one after one.\" They also rested in that mind, and both camps kept guard until Almighty Allah sent the light of day dawn. Thereupon King Sharrkan and his hundred riders took horse and rode forth to the plain, where they found the Franks ranged in line of battle; and Sharrkan said to his followers, \"Our foes have determined like ourselves to do their devoir; so up and at them and lay on load.\" Then came forth an Herald of the Franks and cried out, saying, \"Let there be no general engagement betwixt us this day, save by the duello, a champion of yours against a champion of ours.\" Whereupon one of Sharrkan's riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between the two lines crying, \"Ho! who is for smiting? Let no dastard engage me this day nor niderling!\" Hardly had he made an end of his vaunt, when there sallied forth to him a Frankish cavalier, armed cap-\u00e0-pie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff, riding on a grey white steed,[FN#215] and he had no hair on his cheeks. He urged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the two fell to derring do of cut and thrust, but it was not long before the Frank foined the Moslem with the lance point; and, toppling him from his steed, took him prisoner and led him off crestfallen. His folk rejoiced in their comrade and, forbidding him to go out again to the field, sent forth another, to whom sallied out another Moslem, brother to the captive, and offered him battle. The two fell to, either against other, and fought for a little while, till the Frank bore down upon the Moslem and, falsing him with a feint, tumbled him by a thrust of the lance heel from his destrier and took him prisoner. After this fashion the Moslems ceased not dashing forwards, one after one, and the Franks to unhorse them and take them captive, till day departed and the night with darkness upstarted. Now they had captured of the Moslems twenty cavaliers, and when Sharrken saw this, it was grievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them, \"What is this thing that hath befallen us? To- morrow, I myself will go forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chief and learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn him against doing battle with our band. If he persist, we will punish him with death, and if he prove peaceable we will make peace with him.\" They righted on this wise till Allah Almighty caused the morn to dawn, when mounted the twain and drew up for battle fain; and Sharrkan was going forth to the plain, but behold, more than one half of the Franks dismounted and remained on foot before one of them who was mounted, till they reached the midst of the battle plain. Sharrken looked at that horseman and lo! he was their chief. He was clad in a surcoat of blue satin and a close ringed mail shirt; his face was as the moon when it rises and no hair was upon his cheeks. He hent in hand an Indian scymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow, like a dirham; and he smote the horse with heel till he stood almost in the midst of the field when, signing to the Moslems, he cried out in fluent Arab speech \"Ho, Sharrkan! Ho, son of Omar bin al- Nu'uman! Ho, thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowest cities and countries! up and out to battle bout, and blade single handed wield with one who halves with thee the field! Thou art Prince of thy people and I am Prince of mine; and whoso overcometh his adversary, him let the other's men obey and come under his sway.\" Hardly had he ended his speech, when out came Sharrkan with a heart full of fury, and urging his steed into the midst of the field, closed like a raging lion with the Frank who encountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him with the meeting of warriors. Then they fell to foining and hewing, and they stinted not of onset and offset, and give and take, as they were two mountains clashing together or two seas together dashing; nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and night starkened. Then they drew apart and each returned to his own party; but as soon as Sharrkan foregathered with his comrades, he said, \"Never looked I on the like of this cavalier: he hath one quality I have not yet seen in any and this it is that, when his foemen uncovereth a place for the death blow, he reverseth his weapon and smiteth with the lance-heel! In very deed I know not what will be the issue 'twixt him and me; but 'tis my wish that we had in our host his like and the like of his men.\" Then he went to his rest for the night and, when morning dawned, the Frank came forth and rode down to the mid field, where Sharrkan met him; and they fell to fighting and to wheeling, left and right; and necks were stretched out to see the sight, nor did they stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance with main and might, till the day turned to night and darkness overwhelmed the light. Then the twain drew asunder and returned each to his own camp, where both related to their comrades what had befallen them in the duello; and at last the Frank said to his men, \"Tomorrow shall decide the matter!\" So they both passed that night restfully till dawn; and, as soon as it was day, they mounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight till half the day was done. Then the Frank bethought him of a ruse; first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with the rein, so that he stumbled and fell with his rider; thereupon Sharrkan threw himself on the foe, and would have smitten him with the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged, when the Frank cried out to him, \"O Sharrkan, champions are not wont to do thus! This is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by a woman.\"[FN#216] When Sharrkan heard this, he raised his eyes to the Frank's face and gazing steadfastly at him, recognized in him Princess Abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallen him in the convent; whereupon he cast brand from hand and, kissing the earth before her, asked her, \"What moved thee to a deed like this?\"; and she answered, \"I desired to prove thy prowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting. These that are with me are my handmaids, and they are all clean maids; yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press and stress of plain; and had not my steed stumbled with me, thou shouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat.\" Sharrkan smiled at her speech and said, \"Praise be to Allah for safety and for my reunion with thee, O Queen of the age!\" Then she cried out to her damsels to loose the twenty captives of Sharrkan's troop and dismount. They did as she bade and came and kissed the earth before her and Sharrkan who said to them, \"It is the like of you that Kings keep in store for the need hour.\" Then he signed to his comrades to salute the Princess; so all alighted and kissed the earth before her, for they knew the story. After this, the whole two hundred took horse, and fared on night and day for six days' space, till they drew near to Baghdad, when they halted and Sharrkan bade Abrizah and her handmaids doff the Frankish garb that was on them,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan bade Princess Abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was on them and don the garments of daughters of Greece; and thus did they. Then he despatched a company of his companions to Baghdad to acquaint his father Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with his arrival and report that he was accompanied by Princess Abrizah, daughter of King Hardub, Lord of Graecia-land. They halted forthright in the place they had reached, and Sharrkan also halted and all righted there; and when Almighty Allah made morning dawn, Sharrkan and his company and Abrizah and her company took horse and fared on towards the city; when lo! on the way they met the Wazir Dandan, who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour Abrizah and Sharrkan, by especial commandment of King Omar Son of Al- Nu'uman. When the two drew near, they turned towards them and kissed ground before them; then they mounted again and escorted them into the city and went up with them to the palace. Sharrkan walked in to his father, who rose and embraced him and questioned him of his case. So he told him all that Abrizah had told him, and what had passed between them and said, \"She hath parted from her sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take part with us and make her abode with us; and indeed,\" he said to his father, \"the King of Constantinople hath plotted to do us a mischief, because of his daughter Sophia, for that the King of Greece had made known to him her story and the cause of her being given to thee; and he (the Grecian King) not knowing her to be daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople; and, had he known that, he would not have bestowed her upon thee, but he would have restored her to her parent. And of a verity,\" he continued, \"we were saved from these perils only by the Lady Abrizah, and never saw we a more valiant than she.\" And he went on to tell his father all that had passed from first to last of the wrestling and the single fighting. When King Omar heard the story of Sharrkan, Abrizah was exalted in his eyes, and he longed to see her and question her. Thereupon Sharrkan went out to her and said, \"The King calleth for thee;\" she replied, \"I hear and I obey;\" and he took her and brought her in to his father, who was seated on his throne and who, having dismissed his high officers, was attended only by his eunuchs. The Princess entered and kissing the ground between his hands, saluted him in choice terms. He was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her for her dealing with his son Sharrkan and bade her be seated. So she sat down and unveiled her face;[FN#217] and, when the King saw her beauty, his reason fled his head and he made her draw near and showed her favour, appointing her an especial palace for herself and her damsels, and assigning them solde and allowances. Then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid, and she answered, \"Here be they with me, O King of the age!\" So saying, she rose and going to her lodging, unpacked her baggage and from it brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold. She opened the casket and taking out those three jewels, kissed them and gave them to the King. Then she went away bearing his heart with her. After her going the King sent for his son Sharrkan and gave him one jewel of the three, and when he enquired of the other two replied, \"O my son! I mean to give one to thy brother Zau al-Makan, and the other to thy sister Nuzhat al- Zaman.\" But when Sharrkan heard that he had a brother (for to that time he knew only of his sister) he turned to his sire and said to him, \"O King, hast thou a son other than myself?\" He answered, \"Yes, and he is now six years old;\" adding that his name was Zau al- Makan and that he and Nuzhat al-Zaman were twins, born at a birth. This news was grievous to Sharrkan, but he kept his secret and said, \"The bless- ing of Allah Most High be upon them!\", and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dust off his clothes. Quoth the King, \"How do I see thee change thy manner when hearing of this, considering that after me thou becomes\" heir of the kingdom. Of a truth the troops have sworn to thee and the Emirs and Grandees have taken the oath of succession to thee; and this one of the three jewels is thine.\" Sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandy words with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away, knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath, and stayed not walking till he had entered Abrizah's palace. As he approached she stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done and prayed for blessings on him and his sire. Then she sat down and seated him by her side; but when he had taken his place she saw rage in his face and questioned him, whereupon he told her that Allah had blessed his father with two children by Sophia, a boy and a girl, and that he had named the boy Zau al-Makan and the girl Nuzhat al-Zaman; adding, \"He hath kept the other two jewels for them and hath given me one of thine, so I left it behind; I knew naught of Zau al-Makan's birth till this day, and the twain are now six years old. So when I learnt this, wrath possessed me; and I tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing from thee. But now I fear lest my father take thee to wife, for he loveth thee and I saw in him signs of desire for thee: so what wilt thou say, if he wish this?\" Quoth she, \"Know, O Sharrkan, that thy father hath no dominion over me, nor can he have me without my consent; and if he prevail over me by force, I will take my own life. As for the three jewels, it was not my intent that he should give any of them to either of his children and I had no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury with his things of price; but now I desire of thy favour that thou make me a present of the jewel which he gave thee, if thou have accepted it.\" \"Hearkening and obedience,\" replied Sharrkan, and gave it to her. Then said she, \"Fear nothing,\" and talked with him awhile and continued, \"I fear lest my father hear that I am with you and sit not patiently under my loss, but do his endeavours to find me; and to that end he may ally himself with King Afridun, on account of his daughter Sophia, and both come on thee with armies and so there befal great turmoil.\" When Sharrken heard these words, he said to her, \"O my lady, if it please thee to sojourn with us, take no thought of them; though there gather together against us all that be on land and on sea.\" \" 'Tis well,\" rejoined she; \"if ye entreat me fair, I will tarry with you, and if ye deal evilly by me, I will depart from you.\" Then she bade her slave maidens bring food; so they set the tables, and Sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house, disturbed and perturbed. Such was his case; but regarding the affairs of his father, Omar bin al-Nu'uman, after dismissing his son Sharrkan he arose and, taking the other two jewels, betook himself to the Lady Sophia, who stood up when she saw him and remained standing till he was seated. Presently, his two children, Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman, came to him and he kissed them and hung a jewel round each one's neck, at which they rejoiced and kissed his hands. Then went they to their mother, who joyed in their joy and wished the King long life; so he asked her, \"Why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou art the daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, that I might have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignity and raised thy rank?\" \"O King,\" answered Sophia, \"and what could I desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee, overwhelmed as I am with thy favours and thy benefits? And, furthermore, Allah hath blessed me with two children by thee, a son and a daughter.\" Her reply pleased the King and after leaving her, he set apart for her and her children a wondrous fine palace. Moreover, he appointed for them eunuchs and attendants and doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers and physicians and surgeons to do them service; and in every way he redoubled his favour and entreated them with the best of treatment. And presently he returned to the palace of his dominion and to his Court where he distributed justice among the lieges. So far concerning him and Sophia and her children; but in the matter of Abrizah the King was greatly occupied with love of her and burnt with desire of her night and day; and every night, he would go in to her and converse with her and pay his court to her, but she gave him no answer, only saying, \"O King of the age! I have no desire for men at this present.\" When he saw her withdraw from him, his passion waxed hotter and his longing and pining increased until, when weary of this, he summoned his Wazir Dandan and, opening his very heart to him, told him of his love for Princess Abrizah, daughter of Hardub, and informed him how she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her was doing him to die, for that he could get no grace of her. The Wazir, hearing these words, said to the King, \"As soon as it is dark night, take thou a piece of Bhang the measure of a miskal, about an ounce, and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine with her. When the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near, fill her a last cup and dropping therein the Bhang, give it to her to drink, and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drug take effect on her. Then do thou go in to her and take thy will of her; and such is my advice.\"[FN#218] \"Thy rede is aright,\" quoth the King, and seeking his treasury, he took thence a piece of concentrated Bhang, if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from year to year. This he put in his bosom pocket and waited till some little of the night went by, when he betook himself to the palace of Princess Abrizah, who seeing him stood up to receive him; but he bade her sit down. So she sat down, and he sat by her, and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail, whereupon she furnished the carousing table[FN#219] and placed it before him. Then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted the candles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and all that pertaineth to drinking. So they fell to tippling and the King ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into her head; and seeing this he took out the bit of Bhang from his pocket and, holding it between his fingers, filled a cup with his own hand and drank it off. Then filling a second he said, \"To thy companionship!\"; and dropped the drug into her cup, she knowing naught of it. She took it and drank it off; then she rose and went to her sleeping chamber. He waited for less than an hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on her and had robbed her of her senses, when he went in to her and found her thrown on her back: and she had doffed her petticoat trousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discovered what was between her thighs. When the King saw the state of things and found a lighted candle at her head and another at her feet, shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of his five senses for lust and Satan seduced him and he could not master himself, but put off his trousers and fell upon her and abated her maiden head. Then he rose off her and went to one of her women, by name Marj\u00e1nah, and said, \"Go in to thy lady and speak with her.\" So she went in to her mistress and found her lying on her back insensible, with the blood running down to the calves of her legs, whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped away the blood and lay by her that night. As soon as Almighty Allah brought the dawn, the handmaid Marjanah washed her mistress's hands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face and mouth with it, where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up from her inside that bit of Bhang like a bolus.[FN#220] Then she revived and washed her hands and mouth and said to Marjanah, \"Tell me what hath befallen me.\" So she told her what had passed and how she had found her, lying on her back, with the blood running down, wherefore she knew that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman had lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her. At this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired into privacy, saying to her damsels, \"Deny me to whoso would come in to me and say to him that I am ill, till I see what Allah will do with me.\" Presently the news of her sickness came to the King; so he sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries. Some months she thus passed in solitude, during which time the King's flame cooled and his desire for her was quenched, so that he abstained from her. Now she had conceived by him, and when the months of child breeding had gone by, her pregnancy appeared and her belly swelled, and the world was straitened upon her, so she said to her handmaid Marjanah, \"Know that it is not the folk who have wronged me, but I who sinned against my own self[FN#221] in that I left my father and mother and country. Indeed, I abhor life, for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is left me. I used, when I mounted my steed, to have the mastery of him, but now I am unable to ride. If I be brought to bed among them I shall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in the palace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way of shame; and if I return to my father, with what face shall I meet him or with what face shall I have recourse to him? How well quoth the poet,\n\n'Say, what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor cup companion, nor a cup, nor place to house his head?'\"\n\nMarjanah answered her, \"It is thine to command; I will obey;\" and Abrizah said, \"I desire at once to leave this place secretly, so that none shall know of me but thou; and return to my father and my mother, for when flesh stinketh, there is naught for it but its own folk and Allah shall do with me e'en as He will.\" \"O Princess,\" Marjanah replied, \"what thou wouldest do is well.\" Then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited for some days till the King went out to chase and hunt, and his son Sharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojourn there awhile. Then said she to Marjanah, \"I wish to set out this night, but how shall I do against my destiny? For already I feel the pangs of labour and child birth, and if I abide other four or five days, I shall be brought to bed here, and I shall be unable to travel to my country. But this is what was written on my forehead.\" Then she considered awhile, and said to Marjanah, \"Look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way, for I have no strength to bear arms.\" \"By Allah, O my lady,\" replied Marjanah, \"I know none but a black slave called Al- Ghazb\u00e1n,[FN#222] who is one of the slaves of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman; he is a valiant wight, and he keepeth guard at our palace gate. The King appointed him to attend us, and indeed we have overwhelmed him with our favours; so, lookye, I will go out and speak with him of this matter, and promise him some monies and tell him that, if he have a mind to tarry with us, I will marry him to whom he will. He told me before to day that he had been a highwayman; so if he consent to us we shall win our wish and reach to our own land.\" She rejoined, \"Call him that I may talk with him;\" whereupon Marjanah fared forth and said to the slave, 'O Ghazban, Allah prosper thee, so thou fall in with what my lady saith to thee!\" Then she took him by the hand and brought him to the Princess, whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him, her heart took fright at him. \"How ever,\" she said to herself, \"of a truth, Need giveth the law;\" and she approached to speak with him, yet her heart started away from him. Presently she said, \"O Ghazban, say me, wilt thou help me against the perfidies of Fortune and conceal my secret if I discover it to thee?\" When the slave saw her, his heart was taken by storm and he fell in love with her forthright and could not but reply; \"O my mistress, whatsoever thou biddest me do, I will not depart therefrom.\" Quoth she, \"I would have thee take me at this hour and take this my handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the King's horses and set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat of provaunt, and go with us to our own country; where, if thou desire to abide with us, I will marry thee to her thou shalt choose of my handmaidens, or, if thou prefer return to thine own land, we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires\" after thou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee.\" When Al Ghazban, heard this, he rejoiced with great joy and replied, \"O my lady, I will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go at once and saddle the horses.\" Then he went away gladsome and saying to himself, \"I shall get my will of them and if they will not yield to me, I will kill them both and take their riches.\" But he kept this his intent to himself, and presently returned with two camels and three head of horses, one of which he rode, and Princess Abrizah made Marjanah mount the second she mounting the third, albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not her soul for anguish. And the slave ceased not travelling with them night and day through the passes of the mountains, till there remained but musingly march between them and their own country; when the travail pangs came upon Abrizah and she could no longer resist; so she said to Al-Ghazban, \"Set me down, for the pains of labour are upon me;\" and cried to Marjanah, \"Do thou alight and sit by me and deliver me.\" Then Marjanah dismounted from her horse, and Al-Ghazban did in like sort, and they made fast the bridles and helped the Princess to dismount, for she was aswoon from excess of anguish. When Al-Ghazban saw her on the ground, Satan entered into him and he drew his falchion and brandishing it in her face, said \"O my lady, vouchsafe me thy favours.\" Hearing these words she turned to him and said, \"It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the black slave Al Ghazban, \"It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!\" And she was wroth with him and cried, \"Woe to thee! what words are these thou sayest? Out on thee, and talk not thus in my presence and know that I will never consent to what thou sayest, though I drink the cup of death. Wait till I have cast my burden and am delivered of the after birth, and then, if thou be able thereto, do with me as thou wilt; but, an thou leave not lewd talk at this time assuredly I will slay myself with my own hand and quit the world and be at peace from all this.\" And she began reciting extempore,[FN#223]\n\n\"O spare me, thou Ghazban, indeed enow for me * Are heavy strokes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    of time, mischance and misery!\nWhoredom my Lord forfends to all humanity; * Quoth He, 'Who\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   breaks my bidding Hell for home shall see!'\nAnd if thou leave not suing me to whoredom's way * Against th'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Almighty's choicest gift, my chastity,\nUpon my tribesmen I with might and main will call * And gather\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  all, however far or near they be;\nAnd with Yam\u00e1ni blade were I in pieces hewn, * Ne'er shall he\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   sight my face who makes for villeiny,\nThe face of free born come of noble folk and brave; * What then\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    can be to me the seed of whoreson slave?\"\n\nWhen Ghazban heard these lines he was wroth exceedingly; his eyes reddened with blood and his face became a dusty grey[FN#224]; his nostrils swelled, his lips protruded and the repulsiveness of his aspect redoubled. And he repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Ho thou, Abrizah, mercy! leave me not for I * Of thy love and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yam\u00e1ni[FN#225] glance the victim lie\nMy heart is cut to pieces by thy cruelty, * My body wasted and my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  patience done to die:\nFrom glances ravishing all hearts with witchery * Reason far\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   flies, the while desire to thee draws nigh;\nThough at thy call should armies fill the face of earth * E'en\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   now I'd win my wish and worlds in arms defy!\"\n\nWhen Abrizah heard these words, she wept with sore weeping and said to him, \"Woe to thee, O Ghazban! How dareth the like of thee to address me such demand, O base born and obscene bred? Dost thou deem all folk are alike?\" When the vile slave heard this from her, he waxt more enraged and his eyes grew redder: and he came up to her and smiting her with the sword on her neck wounded her to the death. Then he drove her horse before him with the treasure and made off with himself to the mountains. Such was the case with Al-Ghazban; but as regards Abrizah, she gave birth to a son, like the moon, and Marjanah took the babe and did him the necessary offices and laid him by his mother's side; and lo and behold! the child fastened to its mother's breast and she dying.[FN#226] When Marjanah saw this, she cried out with a grievous cry and rent her raiment and cast dust on her head and buffeted her cheeks till blood flowed, saying, \"Alas, my mistress! Alas, the pity of it! Thou art dead by the hand of a worthless black slave, after all thy knightly prowess!\" And she ceased not weeping when suddenly a great cloud of dust arose and walled the horizon;[FN#227] but, after awhile, it lifted and discovered a numerous conquering host. Now this was the army of King Hardub, Princess Abrizah's father, and the cause of his coming was that when he heard of his daughter and her handmaids having fled to Baghdad, and that they were with King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, he had come forth, leading those with him, to seek tidings of her from travellers who might have seen her with the King. When he had gone a single day's march from his capital, he espied three horse men afar off and made towards them, intending to ask whence they came and seek news of his daughter. Now these three whom he saw at a distance were his daughter and Marjanah and the slave Al- Ghazban; and he made for them to push inquiry. Seeing this the villain blackamoor feared for himself; so he killed Abrizah and fled for his life. When they came up, King Hardub saw his daughter lying dead and Marjanah weeping over her, and he threw himself from his steed and fell fainting to the ground. All the riders of his company, the Emirs and Waxirs, took foot and forth right pitched their tents on the mountain and set up for the King a great pavilion, domed and circular, without which stood the grandees of the realm. When Marjanah saw her master, she at once recognized him and her tears redoubled; and, when he came to himself, he questioned her and she told him all that had passed and said, \"Of a truth he that hath slain thy daughter is a black slave belonging to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and she informed him how Sharrkan's father had dealt with the Princess. When King Hardub heard this, the world grew black in his sight and he wept with sore weeping. Then he called for a litter and, therein laying his dead daughter, returned to Caesarea and carried her into the palace, where he went in to his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, and said to that Lady of Calamities, \"Shall the Moslems deal thus with my girl? Verily King Omar bin al-Nu'uman despoiled her of her honour by force, and after this, one of his black slaves slew her. By the truth of the Messiah, I will assuredly take blood revenge for my daughter and clear away from mine honour the stain of shame; else will I kill myself with mine own hand!\" And he wept passing sore. Quoth his mother, \"None other than Marjanah killed thy daughter, for she hated her in secret;\" and she continued to her son, \"Fret not for taking the blood wit of thy daughter, for, by the truth of the Messiah, I will not turn back from King Omar bin al-Nu'uman till I have slain him and his sons; and of a very truth I will do with him a deed, passing the power of Sage and Knight, whereof the chroniclers shall tell chronicles in all countries and in every place: but needs must thou do my bidding in all I shall direct, for whoso be firmly set on the object of his desire shall surely compass his desire.\" \"By the virtue of the Messiah,\" replied he, \"I will not cross thee in aught thou shalt say.\" Then quoth she, \"Bring me a number of hand maids, high bosomed virgins, and summon the wise men of the age and let them teach them philosophy and the rules of behaviour before Kings, and the art of conversation and making verses; and let them talk with them of all manner science and edifying knowledge. And the sages must be Moslems, that they may teach them the language and traditions of the Arabs, together with the history of the Caliphs and the ancient annals of the Kings of Al-Islam; and if we persevere in this for four years' space, we shall gain our case. So possess thy soul in patience and wait; for one of the Arabs saith, 'If we take man bote after years forty the time were short to ye.' When we have taught the girls these things, we shall be able to work our will with our foe, for he doteth on women and he hath three hundred and sixty concubines, whereto are now added an hundred of the flowers of thy handmaidens who were with thy daughter, she that hath found mercy.[FN#228] As soon as I have made an end of their education, as described to thee, I will take them and set out with them in person.\" When King Hardub heard his mother's words, he rejoiced and arose and kissed her head; and at once despatched messengers and couriers to lands sundry and manifold to fetch him Moslem sages. They obeyed his commands and fared to far countries and thence brought him the sages and the doctors he sought. When these came into presence, he honoured them with notable honorurs and bestowed dresses on them and appointed to them stipends and allowances and promised them much money whenas they should have taught the damsels. Then he committed the handmaidens to their hands\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-third Night.\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the sages and the doctors stood in presence of King Hardub, he honoured them with notable honours and committed the hand maidens to their hands, enjoining that these be instructed in all manner of knowledge, philosophy and polite accomplishments; and they set themselves to do his bidding. Such was the case with King Hardub; but as for King Omar bin al Nu'uman, when he returned from coursing and hunting and entered his palace, he sought Princess Abrizah but found her not, nor any one knew of her nor could any give him news of her. This was grievous to him and he said, \"How could the lady leave the palace unknown of any? Had my kingdom been at stake in this case, it were in perilous condition there being none to govern it! I will never again go to sport and hunt till I have stationed at the gates those who shall keep good guard over them!\" And he was sore vexed and his breast was straitened for the loss of Princess Abrizah. Hereupon behold, his son Sharrkan returned from his journey; and the father told him what had happened, and informed him how the lady had fled, whilst he was chasing and hunting, whereat he grieved with exceeding grief. Then King Omar took to visiting his children every day and making much of them and brought them learned men and doctors to teach them, appointing for them stipends. When Sharrkan saw this, he raged with exceeding rage and envied thereupon his brother and sister till the signs of chagrin appeared in his face and he ceased not to languish by reason of this matter: so one day his father said to him, \"Why do I see thee grown weak in body and yellow of face?\" \"O my father,\" replied Sharrkan, \"every time I see thee fondle my brother and sister and make much of them, jealousy seizeth on me, and I fear lest it grow on me till I slay them and thou slay me in return. And this is the reason of my weakness of body and change of complexion. But now I crave of thy favour that thou give me one of thy castles outlying the rest, that I may abide there the remnant of my life, for as the sayer of bywords saith, 'Absence from my friend is better and fitter for me'; and, 'Whatso eye doth not perceive, that garreth not heart to grieve.'\" And he bowed his head towards the ground. When King Omar bin al-Nu'uman heard his words and knew the cause of his ailment and of his being broken down, he soothed his heart and said to him, \"O my son, I grant thee this and I have not in my reign a greater than the Castle of Damascus, and the government of it is thine from this time.\" Thereupon he forthright summoned his secretaries of state and bade them write Sharrkan's patent of investiture to the viceroyalty of Damascus of Syria. And when they had written it, he equipped him and sent with him the Wazir Dandan, and invested him with the rule and government and gave him instructions as to policy and regulations; and took leave of him, and the grandees and officers of state did likewise, and he set out with his host. When he arrived at Damascus, the townspeople beat the drums and blew the trumpets and decorated the city and came out to meet him in great state; whilst all the notables and grandees paced in procession, and those who stood to the right of the throne walked on his right flank, and the others to the left. Thus far concerning Sharrkan; but as regards his father, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, soon after the departure of his son, the children's tutors and governors presented themselves before him and said to him, \"O our lord, thy children have now learnt knowledge and they are completely versed in the rules of manners and the etiquette of ceremony.\" The King rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy and conferred bountiful largesse upon the learned men, seeing Zau al- Makan grown up and flourishing and skilled in horsemanship. The Prince had reached the age of fourteen and he occupied himself with piety and prayers, loving the poor, the Olema and the Koran students, so that all the people of Baghdad loved him, men and women. One day, the procession of the Mahmil[FN#229] of Ir\u00e1k passed round Baghdad before its departure for the pilgrimage to Meccah and visitation of the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and preserve!). When Zau al-Makan the Mahmil procession he was seized with longing desire to become a pilgrim,[FN#230] so he went in to his sire and said, \"I come to ask thy leave to make the pilgrimage.\" But his father forbade him saying, \"Wait till next year and I will go and thou too.\" When the Prince saw that the matter was postponed, he betook himself to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, whom he found standing at prayer. As soon as she had ended her devotions he said to her, \"I am dying with desire of pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah at Meccah and to visit the tomb of the Prophet, upon whom be peace! I asked my father's leave, but he forbade me that, so I mean to take privily somewhat of money and set out on the pilgrimage without his knowledge.\" \"Allah upon thee,\" exclaimed she, \"take me with thee and deprive me not of visitation to the tomb of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and keep!\" And he answered, \"As soon as it is dark night, do thou come forth from this place, without telling any.\" Accordingly,When it was the middle of the night she arose and took somewhat of money and donned a man's habit; and she ceased not walking to the palace gate, where she found Zau al-Makan with camels ready for marching. So he mounted and mounted her; and the two fared on till they were in the midst of the Iraki[FN#231] pilgrim-party, and they ceased not marching and Allah wrote safety for them, till they entered Meccah the Holy and stood upon Araf\u00e1t and performed the pilgrimage rites. Then they made a visitation to the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and assain!) and thought to return with the pilgrims to their native land. But Zau al-Makan said to his sister, \"O my sister, it is in my mind to visit the Holy House,[FN#232] Jerusalem, and Abraham the Friend of Allah[FN#233] (on whom be peace!).\" \"I also desire so to do,\" replied she. So they agreed upon this and he fared forth and took passage for himself and her and they made ready and set out in the ship with a company of Jerusalem palmers. That very night the sister fell sick of an aguish chill, and was grievously ill but presently recovered, after which the brother also sickened. She tended him during his malady and they ceased not wayfaring till they arrived at Jerusalem, but the fever increased on him and he grew weaker and weaker. They alighted at a Khan and there hired a lodging; but Zau al- Makan's sickness ceased not to increase on him, till he was wasted with leanness and became delirious. At this, his sister was greatly afflicted and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the decree of Allah!\" They sojourned in that place awhile, his weakness ever increasing and she attending him and buying necessaries for him and for herself, till all the money she had was expended and she became so poor that she had not so much as a dirham left. Then she sent a servant of the Khan to the bazar with some of her clothes, and he sold them and she spent the price upon her brother; then sold she something more and she ceased not selling all she had, piece by piece, till nothing was left but an old rug. Whereupon she wept and exclaimed, \"Verily is Allah the Orderer of the past and the future!\" Presently her brother said to her, \"O my sister, I feel recovery drawing near and my heart longeth for a little roast meat.\" \"By Allah! O my brother,\" replied she, \"I have no face to beg; but tomorrow I will enter some rich man's house and serve him and earn somewhat for our living.\" Then she bethought herself awhile and said, \"Of a truth 'tis hard for me to leave thee and thou in this state, but I must despite myself!\" He rejoined, \"Allah forbid! Thou wilt be put to shame; but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah!\" And he wept and she wept too. Then she said, \"O my brother, we are strangers who have dwelt here a full year, but none hath yet knocked at our door. Shall we then die of hunger? I know no resource but that I go out and do service and earn somewhat to keep us alive, till thou recover from thy sickness, when we will travel back to our native land.\" She sat weeping awhile and he wept too, propped upon his elbow. Then Nuzhat al-Zaman arose and, veiling her head with a bit of camlet,[FN#234] which had been of the cameleer's clothes and which the owner had forgotten and left with them; she kissed the head of her brother and embraced him and went forth from him, weeping and knowing not whither she should wend. And she stinted not going and her brother Zau al-Makan awaiting her return till the supper time; but she came not, and he watched for her till the morning morrowed but still she returned not; and this endured till two days went by. He was greatly troubled thereat and his heart fluttered for her, and hunger was sore upon him. At last he left the chamber and, calling the servant of the caravanserai, said, \"I wish thee to bear me to the bazar.\" So he carried him to the market street and laid him down there; and the people of Jerusalem gathered round him and were moved to tears seeing his condition. He signed to them begging for somewhat to eat; so they brought him some money from certain of the merchants who were in the bazar, and bought food and fed him therewith; after which they carried him to a shop, where they spread him a mat of palm leaves and set an ewer of water at his head. When night fell, all the folk went away, sore concerned for him and, in the middle of the night, he called to mind his sister and his sickness redoubled on him, so that he abstained from eating and drinking and became insensible to the world around him. Then the bazar people arose and took for him from the merchants thirty seven dirhams, and hiring a camel, said to the driver, \"Carry this sick man to Damascus and leave him in the hospital; haply he may be cured and recover health.\" \"On my head be it!\" replied the camel man; but he said to himself, \"How shall I take this sick man to Damascus, and he nigh upon death?\" So he carried him away to a place and hid with him till the night, when he threw him down on the ash heap near the fire hole of a Hammam and went his way. When morning dawned the Stoker[FN#235] of the bath came to his work and, finding Zau al-Makan cast on his back, exclaimed, \"Why did they not throw their dead body anywhere but here?\" So saying, he gave him a kick and he moved; whereupon quoth the Fireman, \"Some one of you who hath eaten a bit of Hashish and hath thrown himself down in whatso place it be!\" Then he looked at his face and saw his hairless cheeks and his grace and comeliness; so he took pity on him and knew that he was sick and a stranger in the land. And he cried, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! verily, I have sinned against this youth, for indeed the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!) enjoineth honour to the stranger, more especially when the stranger is sick.\" Then he carried him home and went in with him to his wife and bade her tend him. So she spread him a sleeping rug and set a cushion under his head, then warmed water for him and washed therewith his hands and feet and face. Meanwhile, the Stoker went to the market and bought some rose water and sugar, and sprinkled Zau al-Makan's face with the water and gave him to drink of the sherbet. Then he fetched a clean shirt and put it on him. With this, Zau al-Makan sniffed the zephyr of health and recovery returned to him; and he sat up and leant against the pillow. Hereat the Fireman rejoiced and exclaimed, \"Praise be to Allah for the welfare of this youth! O Allah, I beseech Thee by Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make the salvation of this youth to be at my hands!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fireman exclaimed, \"O Allah, I beseech Thee of Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make this young man's life the work of my hands!\" And he ceased not to nurse him for three days, giving him to drink of sherbet of sugar and willow flower water and rose water; and doing him all manner of service and kindness, till health began to return to his body and Zau al-Makan opened his eyes. Presently came in the Fireman and, seeing him sitting up and showing signs of amendment, said to him, \"What is now thy state, O my son?\" \"Praise be to Allah,\" replied Zau al-Makan, \"I am well and like to recover, if such be the will of Allah Almighty at this time.\" The Stoker praised the Lord of All for this and, wending fast to the market, bought ten chickens, which he carried to his wife and said, \"Kill two of these for him every day, one at dawn of day and the other at fall of day.\" So she rose up and killed a fowl and brought it to him boiled, and fed him with the flesh and made him drink its broth. When he had done eating, she fetched hot water and he washed his hands and lay back upon the pillow, whereupon she covered him up with the coverlet, and he slept till the time of the mid afternoon prayer. Then she arose and killed another fowl and boiled it; after which she cut it up and, bringing it to Zau al-Makan, said, \"Eat, O my son!\" While he was eating; behold, her husband entered and seeing her feeding him, sat down at his head and said to him, \"How is it with thee now, O my son?\" \"Thanks be to Allah for recovery!\" he replied: \"may the Almighty requite thee thy kindness to me.\" At this the Fireman rejoiced and going out, bought sherbet of violets and rose water and made him drink it. Now the Stoker used to work at the Hammam all day for a wage of five dirhams, whereof he spent every day, for Zau al-Makan, one dirham upon sugar and sherbet of rose water and willow flower water,[FN#236] and another dirham for fowls; and he ceased not to entreat him thus kindly during a whole month, till the traces of illness ceased from him and he was once more sound and whole. Thereupon the Fireman and his wife rejoiced and asked him, \"O my son, wilt thou go with me to the bath?\"; whereto he answered, \"Yes!\" So the Stoker went to the bazar and fetched a donkey boy, and he mounted Zau al-Makan on the ass and supported him in the saddle till they came to the bath. Then he made him sit down and seated the donkey boy in the furnace-room and went forth to the market and bought Iote leaves and lupin-flour,[FN#237] with which he returned to the bath and said to Zau al-Makan, \"O my master, in Allah's name, walk in and I will wash thy body.\" So they entered the inner room of the bath, and the Fireman took to rubbing Zau al-Makan's legs and began to wash his body with the leaves and meal, when there came to them a bathman, whom the bath keeper had sent to Zau al-Makan; and he, seeing the Stoker washing and rubbing him, said, \"This is doing injury to the keeper's rights.\" Replied the Fireman, \"The master overwhelmeth us with his favours!\" Then the bathman proceeded to shave Zau al-Makan's head, after which he and the Stoker washed themselves and returned to the house, where he clad Zau al-Makan in a shirt of fine stuff and a robe of his own; and gave him a handsome turband and girdle and a light kerchief which he wound about his neck. Meanwhile the Fireman's wife had killed and cooked two chickens; so, as soon as Zau al-Makan entered and seated himself on the carpet, the husband arose and, dissolving sugar in willow flower water, made him drink of it. Then he brought the food tray and, cutting up the chickens, fed him with the flesh and gave him the broth to drink till he was satisfied; when he washed his hands and praised Allah for recovery, and said to the Fireman, \"Thou art he whom the Almighty vouchsafed to me and made the cause of my cure!\" \"Leave this talk,\" replied the other, \"and tell us the cause of thy coming to this city and whence thou art. Thy face showeth signs of gentle breeding.\" \"Tell me first how thou camest to fall in with me,\" said Zau al-Makan; \"and after I will tell thee my story.\" Rejoined the Fireman, \"As for that, I found thee lying on the rubbish heap by the door of the fire house, as I went to my work near the morning, and knew not who had thrown thee there. So I carried thee home with me; and this is all my tale.\" Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"Glory to Him who quickeneth the bones, though they be rotten! Indeed, O my brother, thou hast not done good save to one worthy of it, and thou shalt presently gather its fruitage.\" And he added, \"But where am I now?\" \"Thou art in the city of Jerusalem,\" replied the Stoker; where upon Zau al-Makan called to mind his strangerhood and remembered his separation from his sister and wept. Then he discovered his secret to the Fireman and told him his story and began repeating,\n\n\"In love they bore me further than my force would go, * And for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    them made me suffer resurrection throe:\nOh, have compassion, cruel! on this soul of mine * Which, since\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ye fared, is pitied by each envious foe;\nNor grudge the tender mercy of one passing glance * My case to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    lighten, easing this excess of woe:\nQuoth I 'Heart, bear this loss in patience!' Patience cried *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Take heed! no patience in such plight I'm wont to show.' \"\n\nThen he redoubled his weeping, and the Fireman said to him, \"Weep not, but rather praise Allah for safety and recovery.\" Asked Zau al-Makan, \"How far is it hence to Damascus?\" Answered the other, \"Six days' journey.\" Then quoth Zau al-Makan, \"Wilt thou send me thither?\" \"O my lord,\" quoth the Stoker, \"how can I allow thee to go alone, and thou a youth and a stranger to boot? If thou would journey to Damascus, I am one who will go with thee; and if my wife will listen to and obey me and accompany me, I will take up my abode there; for it is no light matter to part with thee.\" Then said he to his wife, \"Wilt thou travel with me to Damascus of Syria or wilt thou abide here, whilst I lead this my lord thither and return to thee? For he is bent upon going to Damascus of Syria and, by Allah, it is hard to me to part with him, and I fear for him from highway men.\" Replied she, \"I will go with you both;\" and he rejoined, \"Praised be Allah for accord, and we have said the last word!\" Then he rose and selling all his own goods and his wife's gear,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say,\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fire man and his wife agreed with Zau al-Makan to travel with him Damascus wards. Then the Stoker sold his goods and his wife's gear and bought a camel and hired an ass for Zau al-Makan; and they set out, and ceased not wayfaring for six days till they reached Damascus. And they arrived there towards eventide; when the Fireman went forth and, as was his wont, bought some meat and drink. They had dwelt but five days in Damascus, when his wife sickened and, after a short illness, was translated to the mercy of Almighty Allah. Her death was a heavy matter to Zau al-Makan, for he was grown used to her as she had tended him assiduously; and the Fireman grieved for her with excessive grief. Presently the Prince turned to the Stoker and finding him mourning, said to him, \"Grieve not, for at this gate we must all go in.\" Replied he, \"Allah make weal thy lot, O my son! Surely He will compensate us with His favours and cause our mourning to cease. What sayst thou, O my son, about our walking abroad to view Damascus and cheer thy spirits?\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"Thy will is mine.\" So the Fireman arose and placed his hand in that of Zau al- Makan and the two walked on till they came to the stables of the Viceroy of Damascus, where they found camels laden with chests and carpets and brocaded stuffs, and horses ready saddled and Bactrian dromedaries, while Mamelukes and negro slaves and folk in a hubbub were running to and fro. Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"I wonder to whom belong all these chattels and camels and stuffs!\" So he asked one of the eunuchs, \"Whither this dispatching?'' and he answered, \"These are presents sent by the Emir of Damascus to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with the tribute of Syria.\" Now when Zau al-Makan heard his father's name his eyes brimmed over with tears, and he began repeating,\n\n\"Oh ye gone from the gaze of these ridded eyne, * Ye whose sight\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     in my spirit shall ever dwell!\nYour charms are gone, but this heart of me * Hath no sweet, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     no pleasures its sour dispel;\nIf Allah's grace make us meet again, * In long drawn love-tale my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     love I'll tell.\"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verse, he wept and the Fireman said to him, \"O my son, we hardly believed that thy health had returned;[FN#238] so take heart and do not weep, for I fear a relapse for thee.\" And he ceased not comforting and cheering him, whilst Zau al-Makan sighed and moaned over his strangerhood and separation from his sister and his family; and tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets,\n\n\"Get thee provaunt in this world ere thou wend upon thy way, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And know how surely Death descends thy life lot to waylay:\nAll thy worldly goods are pride and the painfullest repine; * All\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   thy worldly life is vexing, of thy soul in vain display:\nSay is not worldly wone like a wanderer's place of rest, * Where\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   at night he 'nakhs'[FN#239] his camels and moves off at dawn\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   of day?\"\n\nAnd he continued to weep and wail over his separation; whilst the Fireman also bewept the loss of his wife, yet ceased not to comfort Zau al-Makan till morning dawned. When the sun rose, he said to him, \"Meseemeth thou yearnest for thy native land?\" \"Yes,\" replied Zau al-Makan, \"and I can no longer tarry here; so I will commend thee to Allah's care and set out with these folk and journey with them, little by little, till I come to my mother land.\" Said the Stoker, \"And I with thee; for of a truth I cannot bear to part with thee. I have done thee kindly service and I mean to complete it by tending thee on thy travel.\" At this, Zau al-Makan rejoiced and said, \"Allah abundantly requite thee for me!\" and was pleased with the idea of their travelling together. The Fireman at once went forth and bought another ass, selling the camel; and laid in his provaunt and said to Zau al-Makan, \"This is for thee to ride by the way; and, when thou art weary of riding, thou canst dismount and walk.\" Said Zau al-Makan, \"May Allah bless thee and aid me to requite thee! for verily thou hast dealt with me more lovingly than one with his brother.\" Then he waited till it was dark night, when he laid the provisions and baggage on that ass and set forth upon their journey. This much befel Zau al-Makan and the Fireman; but as regards what happened to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, when she left her brother in the Khan where they abode and, wrapped in the old camlet, went out to seek service with some one, that she might earn wherewithal to buy him the roast meat he longed for, she fared on, weeping and knowing not whither to go, whilst her mind was occupied with thoughts of her brother and of her family and her native land. So she implored Allah Almighty to do away with these calamities from them and began versifying,\n\n\"Dark falls the night and Passion comes sore pains to gar me\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    dree, * And pine upstirs those ceaseless pangs which work my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   tormentry,\nAnd cease not separation flames my vitals to consume, * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   drives me on destruction way this sorrow's ecstacy\nAnd longing breeds me restlessness; desire for ever fires, * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  tears to all proclaim what I would keep in secrecy\nNo cunning shift is known to me a meeting to secure, * That I may\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    quit this sickly state, may cure my malady:\nThe love which blazeth in my heart is fed with fancy fuel, * The\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   lover from its hell of fire must bear Hell's agony![FN#240]\nO thou who blamest me for all befel me, 'tis enough, * Patient I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   bear what ever wrote the Reed of Doom for me:\nBy Love I swear I'll never be consoled, no, never more; * I swear\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     the oath of Love's own slaves who know no perjury:\nO Night, to chroniclers of Love the news of me declare; * That\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   sleep hath fed mine eyelids of thy knowledge witness bear!\"\n\nThen she walked on, weeping and turning right and left as she went, when behold, there espied her an old Badawi[FN#241] who had come into the town from the desert with wild Arabs other five. The old man took note of her and saw that she was lovely, but she had nothing on her head save a piece of camlet, and, marvelling at her beauty, he said to himself, \"This charmer dazzleth men's wits but she is in squalid condition, and whether she be of the people of this city or she be a stranger, I needs must have her.\" So he followed her, little by little, till he met her face to face and stopped the way before her in a narrow lane, and called out to her, asking her case, and said, \"Tell me, O my little daughter! art thou a free woman or a slave?\" When she heard this, she said to him, \"By thy life, do not add to my sorrows!\" Quoth he, \"Allah hath blessed me with six daughters, of whom five died and only one is left me, the youngest of all; and I came to ask thee if thou be of the folk of this city or a stranger; that I might take thee and carry thee to her, to bear her company so as to divert her from pining for her sisters. If thou have no kith and kin, I will make thee as one of them and thou and she shall be as my two children.\" Nuzhat al-Zaman bowed her head in bashfulness when she heard what he said and communed with herself, \"Haply I may trust myself to this old man.\" Then she said to him, \"O nuncle, I am a maiden of the Arabs and a stranger and I have a sick brother; but I will go with thee to thy daughter on one condition, which is, that I may spend only the day with her and at night may return to my brother. If thou strike this bargain I will fare with thee, for I am a stranger and I was high in honour among my tribe, and I awoke one morning to find myself vile and abject. I came with my brother from the land of Al-Hijaz and I fearless he know not where I am.\" When the Badawi heard this, he said to himself, \"By Allah, I have got my desire!\" Then he turned to her and replied, \"There shall none be dearer to me than thou; I wish thee only to bear my daughter company by day and thou shalt go to thy brother at earliest nightfall. Or, if thou wilt, bring him over to dwell with us.\" And the Badawi ceased not to console her heart and coax her, till she trusted in him and agreed to serve him. Then he walked on before her and, when she followed him, he winked to his men to go in advance and harness the dromedaries and load them with their packs and place upon them water and provisions, ready for setting out as soon as he should come up with the camels. Now this Badawi was a base born churl, a highway thief and a traitor to the friend he held most fief, a rogue in grain, past master of plots and chicane. He had no daughter and no son and was only passing through the town when, by the decree of the Decreer, he fell in with this unhappy one. And he ceased not to hold her in converse on the highway till they came without the city of Jerusalem and, when outside, he joined his companions and found they had made ready the dromedaries. So the Badawi mounted a camel, having seated Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him and they rode on all night. Then she knew that the Badawi's proposal was a snare and that he had tricked her; and she continued weeping and crying out the whole night long, while they journeyed on making for the mountains, in fear any should see them. Now when it was near dawn, they dismounted from their dromedaries and the Badawi came up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said to her, \"O city strumpet, what is this weeping? By Allah, an thou hold not thy peace, I will beat thee to death, O thou town filth!\" When she heard this she loathed life and longed for death; so she turned to him and said, \"O accursed old man, O gray beard of hell, how have I trusted thee and thou hast played me false, and now thou wouldst torture me?\" When he heard her reply he cried out, \"O lazy baggage, dost thou dare to bandy words with me?\" And he stood up to her and beat her with a whip, saying, \"An thou hold not thy peace, I will kill thee!\" So she was silent awhile, then she called to mind her brother and the happy estate she had been in and she shed tears secretly. Next day, she turned to the Badawi and said to him, \"How couldst thou play me this trick and lure me into these bald and stony mountains, and what is thy design with me?\" When he heard her words he hardened his heart and said to her, \"O lazy baggage of ill omen and insolent! wilt thou bandy words with me?\" and he took the whip and came down with it on her back till she felt faint. Then she bowed down over his feet and kissed[FN#242] them; and he left beating her and began reviling her and said, \"By the rights of my bonnet,[FN#243] if I see or hear thee weeping, I will cut out thy tongue and stuff it up thy coynte, O thou city filth!\" So she was silent and made him no reply, for the beating pained her; but sat down with her arms round her knees and, bowing her head upon her collar, began to look into her case and her abasement after her lot of high honour; and the beating she had endured; and she called to mind her brother and his sickness and forlorn condition, and how they were both strangers in a far country, which crave her tears down her cheeks and she wept silently and began repeating,\n\n\"Time hath for his wont to upraise and debase, * Nor is lasting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   condition for human race:\nIn this world each thing hath appointed turn; * Nor may man\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    transgress his determined place:\nHow long these perils and woes? Ah woe * For a life, all woeful\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    in parlous case!\nAllah bless not the days which have laid me low * I' the world,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    with disgrace after so much grace!\nMy wish is baffled, my hopes cast down, * And distance forbids me\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     to greet his face:\nO thou who passeth that dear one's door, * Say for me, these\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     tears shall flow evermore!\"\n\nWhen she had finished her verses, the Badawi came up to her and, taking compassion on her, bespoke her kindly and wiped away her tears. Then he gave her a barley scone and said, \"I love not one who answereth at times when I am in wrath: so henceforth give me no more of these impertinent words and I will sell thee to a good man like myself, who will do well with thee, even as I have done.\" \"Yes; whatso thou doest is right,\" answered she; and when the night was longsome upon her and hunger burnt her, she ate very little of that barley bread. In the middle of the night the Badawi gave orders for departure,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Badawi gave the barley scone to Nuzhat al-Zaman and promised he would sell her to a good man like himself, she replied, \"Whatso thou doest is right!\" and, about midnight when hunger burned her,[FN#244] she ate a very little of that barley bread and the Badawi ordered his party to set out; so they loaded their loads and he mounted a camel setting Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him. Then they journeyed and ceased not journeying for three days, till they entered the city of Damascus and alighted at the Sultan's Khan, hard by the Viceroy's Gate. Now she had lost her colour by grief and the fatigue of such travelling, and she ceased not to weep over her misfortunes. So the Badawi came up to her and said, \"O thou city filth, by the right of my bonnet, if thou leave not this weeping, I will sell thee to none but a Jew!\" Then he arose and took her by the hand and carried her to a chamber, and walked off to the bazar, and he went round to, the merchants who dealt in slave girls, and began to parley with them, saying, \"I have brought a slave girl whose brother fell ill, and I sent him to my people about Jerusalem, that they might tend him till he is cured. As for her I want to sell her, but after the dog her brother fell sick, the separation from him was grievous to her, and since then she doth nothing but weep, and now I wish that whoso is minded to buy her of me speak softly to her and say, 'Thy brother is with me in Jerusalem ill'; and I will be easy with him about her price.\" Then one of the merchants came up to him and asked, \"How old is she?\" He answered \"She is a virgin, just come to marriageable age, and she is endowed with sense and breeding and wit and beauty and loveliness. But from the day I sent her brother to Jerusalem, her heart hath been yearning for him, so that her beauty is fallen away and her value lessened.\" Now when the merchant heard this, he set forth with the Badawi and said, \"O Shaykh[FN#245] of the Arabs, I will go with thee and buy of thee this girl whom thou praisest so highly for wit and manners and beauty and loveliness; and I will pay thee her price but it must be upon conditions which if thou accept, I will give thee ready money, and if thou accept not I will return her to thee.\" Quoth the Badawi, \"An thou wilt, take her up to the Sultan Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and condition me any conditions thou likest, for when thou hast brought her before King Sharrkan, haply she will please him, and he will pay thee her price and a good profit for thyself to boot.\" Rejoined the merchant, \"It happens that I have just now something to ask from him, and it is this that he write me an order upon the office, exempting me from custom dues and also that he write me a letter of recommendation to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. So if he take the girl, I will weigh[FN#246] thee out her price at once.\" \"I agree with thee to this condition,\" answered the Badawi. So they returned together to the place where Nuzhat al-Zaman was and the wild Arab stood at the chamber door and called out, saying, \"O N\u00e1jiyah[FN#247]!\" which was the name wherewith he had named her. When she heard him, she wept and made no answer. Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, \"There she sitteth; go to her and look at her and speak to her kindly as I enjoined thee.\" So the trader went up to her in courteous wise and saw that she was wondrous beautiful and loveable, especially as she knew the Arabic tongue; and he said to the Badawi, \"If she be even as thou saddest, I shall get of the Sultan what I will for her.\" Then he bespake her, \"Peace be on thee, my little maid! How art thou?\" She turned to him and replied, \"This also was registered in the Book of Destiny.\" Then she looked at him and, seeing him to be a man of respectable semblance with a handsome face, she said to herself, \"I believe this one cometh to buy me;\" and she continued, \"If I hold aloof from him, I shall abide with my tyrant and he will do me to death with beating. In any case, this person is handsome of face and maketh me hope for better treatment from him than from my brute of a Badawi. May be he cometh only to hear me talk; so I will give him a fair answer.\" All this while her eyes were fixed on the ground; then she raised them to him and said in a sweet voice, \"And upon thee be peace, O my lord, and Allah's mercy and His benediction![FN#248] This is what is commanded of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and preserve! As for thine enquiry how I am, if thou wouldst know my case, it is such as thou wouldst not wish but to thy foe.\" And she held her peace. When the merchant heard what she said, his fancy took wings for delight in her and, turning to the Badawi, he asked him, \"What is her price, for indeed she is noble?\" Thereupon the Badawi waxed angry and answered, \"Thou wilt turn me the girl's head with this talk! Why dost thou say that she is noble,[FN#249] while she is of the scum of slave girls and of the refuse of folk? I will not sell her to thee!\" When the merchant heard this, he knew the man to be weak of wits and said to him, \"Calm thyself, for I will buy her of thee with these blemishes thou mentionest.\" \"And how much wilt thou give me for her?\" enquired the Badawi. Replied the merchant, \"Name thy price for her: none should name the son save his sire.\" Rejoined the Badawi, \"None shall name it but thou thyself.\" Quoth the merchant to himself, \"This wildling is a rudesby and a maggotty head. By Allah, I cannot tell her price, for she hath won my heart with her fair speech and good looks; and, if she can read and write, it will be complete fair luck to her and to her purchaser. But this Badawi does not know her worth.\" Then he turned and said to him, \"O Shaykh of the Arabs, I will give thee in ready money, clear of the tax and the Sultan's dues, two hundred gold pieces.\" Now when the Badawi heard this, he flew into a violent rage and cried at the merchant, saying, \"Get up and go thy ways! By Allah, wert thou to offer me two hundred diners for the bit of camlet she weareth, I would not sell it to thee. And now I will not sell her, but will keep her by me, to pasture the camels and grind my grist.\" And he cried out to her, saying, \"Come here, thou stinkard! I will not sell thee.\" Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, \"I used to think thee a man of judgment; but, by the right of my bonnet, if thou begone not from me, I will let thee hear what shall not please thee!\" Quoth the merchant to himself, \"Of a truth this Badawi is mad and knoweth not her value, and I will say no more to him about her price at the present time; for by Allah, were he a man of sense, he would not say, 'By the rights of my bonnet!' By the Almighty, she is worth the kingdom of the Chosro\u00ebs and I have not her price by me, but if he ask even more, I will give him what he will, though it be all my goods.\" Then he turned and said to him, \"O Shaykh of the Arabs, take patience and calm thyself and tell me what clothes she hath with thee?\" Cried the Badawi, \"And what hath the baggage to do with clothes? By Allah, this camlet in which she is wrapped is ample for her.\" \"With thy leave,\" said the merchant, \"I will unveil her face and examine her even as folk examine slave girls whom they think of buying.\"[FN#250] Replied the other, \"Up and do what thou wilt and Allah keep thy youth! Examine her outside and inside and, if thou wilt, strip off her clothes and look at her when she is naked.\" Quoth the trader, \"Allah forfend! I will look at naught save her face.\"[FN#251] Then he went up to her and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness,\u2014And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchant went up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness, so he sat by her side and asked her, \"O my mistress, what is thy name?\" She answered, \"Doss thou ask what is my name this day or what it was before this day?\" Thereupon the merchant enquired, \"Hast thou then two names: to day's and yesterday's?\" \"Yes,\" replied she, \"my name in the past was Nuzhat al-Zaman, the Delight of the Age; but my name at this present is Ghussat[FN#252] al-Zaman, the Despight of the Age.\" When the merchant heard this his eyes brimmed over with tears and quoth he to her, \"Hast thou not a sick brother?\" \"Ay by Allah, O my lord, I have,\" quoth she, \"but fortune hath parted me and him and he lieth sick in Jerusalem.\" The merchant's head was confounded at the sweetness of her speech and he said to himself, \"Verily, the Badawi spake the truth of her.\" Then she called to mind her brother and his sickness and his strangerhood and her separation from him in his hour of weakness and her not knowing what had befallen him; and she thought of all that had happened to her with the Badawi and of her severance from her mother and father and native land; and the tears coursed down her cheeks and fast as they started they dropped; and she began reciting,\n\n\"Allah, where'er thou be, His aid impart * To thee, who distant\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     dwellest in my heart!\nAllah be near thee how so far thou fare; * Ward off all shifts of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Time, all dangers thwart!\nMine eyes are desolate for thy vanisht sight, * And start my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    tears-ah me, how fast they start!\nWould Heaven I kenned what quarter or what land * Homes thee, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   in what house and tribe thou art\nA fount of life thou drain in greenth of rose, * While drink I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     tear drops for my sole desert?\nAn thou 'joy slumber in those hours, when I * Peel 'twixt my side\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   and couch coals' burning smart?\nAll things were easy save to part from thee, * For my sad heart\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   this grief is hard to dree.\"\n\nWhen the merchant heard her verses, he wept and put out his hand to wipe away the tears from her cheeks; but she let down her veil over her face, saying, \"Heaven forbid, O my lord!''[FN#253] Then the Badawi, who was sitting at a little distance watching them, saw her cover her face from the merchant while about to wipe the tears from her cheeks; and he concluded that she would have hindered him from handling her: so he rose and running to her, dealt her, with a camel's halter he had in his hand, such a blow on the shoulders that she fell to the ground on her face. Her eyebrow struck a stone which cut it open, and the blood streamed down her cheeks; whereupon she screamed a loud scream and felt faint and wept bitterly. The merchant was moved to tears for her and said in himself, \"There is no help for it but that I buy this damsel, though at her weight in gold, and free her from this tyrant.\" And he began to revile the Badawi whilst Nazhat al- Zaman lay in sensible. When she came to herself, she wiped away the tears and blood from her face; and she bound up her head: then, raising her glance to heaven, she besought her Lord with a sorrowful heart and began repeating,\n\n\"And pity one who erst in honour throve, * And now is fallen into\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     sore disgrace.\nShe weeps and bathes her cheeks with railing tears, * And asks\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'What cure can meet this fatal case?'\"\n\nWhen she had ended her verse, she turned to the merchant and said in an undertone, \"By the Almighty, do not leave me with a tyrant who knoweth not Allah the Most High! If I pass this night in his place, I shall kill myself with my own hand: save me from him, so Allah save thee from Gehenna-fire.\" Then quoth the merchant to the Badawi, \"O Shaykh of the Arabs, this slave is none of thine affair; so do thou sell her to me for what thou wilt.\" \"Take her,\" quoth the Badawi, \"and pay me down her price, or I will carry her back to the camp and there set her to feed the camels and gather their dung.\"[FN#254] Said the merchant, \"I will give thee fifty thousand diners for her.\" \"Allah will open!\"[FN#255] replied the Badawi. \"Seventy thousand,\" said the merchant. \"Allah will open!\" repeated the Badawi: \"this is not the capital spent upon her, for she hath eaten with me barley bread to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces.\" The merchant rejoined, \"Thou and thine and all thy tribe in the length of your lives have not eaten a thousand ducats' worth of barley; but I will say thee one word, wherewith if thou be not satisfied, I will set the Viceroy of Damascus on thee and he will take her from thee by force.\" The Badawi continued, \"Say on!\" \"An hundred thousand,\" quoth the merchant. \"I have sold her to thee at that price,\" answered the Badawi; \"I shall be able to buy salt with her.\" The merchant laughed and, going to his lodgings, brought the money and put it into the hand of the Badawi, who took it and made off, saying to himself, \"Needs must I go to Jerusalem where, haply, I shall happen on her brother, and I will bring him here and sell him also.\" So he mounted and journeyed till he arrived at Jerusalem, where he went to the Khan and asked for Zau al-Makan, but could not find him. Such was the case with him; but for what regards the merchant and Nazhat al-Zaman, when he took her he threw some of his clothes over her and carried her to his lodgings,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the trader saved Nuzhat al-Zaman from the Badawi and bore her to his lodgings and robed her in the richest raiment, he went down with her to the bazar, where he bought her what ornaments she chose and put them in a satin bag, which he set before her, saying, \"All is for thee and I ask nothing of thee in return but that, when I lead thee to the Sultan, Viceroy of Damascus, thou acquaint him with the price I paid for thee, albeit it was little compared with thy value: and, if seeing thee he buy thee of me, thou tell him how I have dealt with thee and ask of him for me a royal patent, and a written recommendation wherewith I can repair to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad, to the intent that he may forbid the tax on my stuffs or any other goods in which I traffic.\" When she heard his words, she wept and sobbed, and the merchant said to her, \"O my lady, I observe that, every time I mention Baghdad, thine eyes are tearful: is there any one there whom thou lovest? If it be a trader or the like, tell me; for I know all the merchants and so forth there and, if thou wouldst send him a message, I will bear it for thee.\" Replied she, \"By Allah, I have no acquaintance among merchant folk and the like! I know none there but King Omar bin Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad.\" When the merchant heard her words, he laughed and rejoiced with exceeding joy and said in himself, \"By Allah, I have won my wish!\" Then he said to her, \"Hast thou been shown to him in time past?\" She answered, \"No, but I was brought up with his daughter and he holdeth me dear and I have high honour with him; so if thou wouldst have the King grant thee thy desire, give me ink case and paper and I will write thee a letter; and when thou reachest the city of Baghdad, do thou deliver it into the hand of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and say to him, 'Thy handmaid, Nuzhat al-Zaman, would have thee to know that the chances and changes of the nights and days have struck her as with a hammer, and have smitten her so that she hath been sold from place to place, and she sendeth thee her salams.' And, if he ask further of her, say that I am now with the Viceroy at Damascus.\" The merchant wondered at her eloquence, and his affection for her increased and he said to her I cannot but think that men have played upon thine understanding and sold thee for money. Tell me, dost thou know the Koran by heart?\" \"Yes,\" answered she; \"and I am also acquainted with philosophy and medicine and the prolegomena of science and the commentaries of Galen, the physician, on the canons of Hippocrates; and I have commented him and I have read the Tazkirah and have commented the Burh\u00e1n; and I have studied the Simples of Ibn Bayt\u00e1r, and I have something to say of the canon of Meccah, by Avicenna. I can ree riddles and can solve ambiguities, and discourse upon geometry and am skilled in anatomy I have read the books of the Sh\u00e1fi'\u00ed[FN#256] school and the Traditions of the Prophet and syntax; and I can argue with the Olema and discourse of all manner learning. Moreover I am skilled in logic and rhetoric and arithmetic and the making of talismans and almanacs, and I know thoroughly the Spiritual Sciences[FN#257] and the times appointed for religious duties and I understand all these branches of knowledge.\" Then quoth she to the merchant, \"Bring me ink case and paper, that I write thee a letter which shall aid thee on thy journey to Baghdad and enable thee to do without passports.\" Now when the merchant heard this, he cried out \"Brava! Brava![FN#258] Then O happy he in whose palace thou shalt! Thereupon he brought her paper and ink case and a pen of brass and bussed the earth before her face to do her honour. She took a sheet and handled the reed and wrote therewith these verses,\n\n\"I see all power of sleep from eyes of me hath flown; * Say, did\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   thy parting teach these eyne on wake to wone?\nWhat makes thy memory light such burnings in my heart? * Hath\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    every lover strength such memories to own?\nHow sweet the big dropped cloud which rained on summer day; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'Tis gone and ere I taste its sweets afar 'tis flown:\nI pray the wind with windy breath to bring some news * From thee,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    to lover wightwi' love so woe begone\nComplains to thee a lover of all hope forlorn, * For parting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     pangs can break not only heart but stone.\"\n\nAnd when she had ended writing the verses she continued, \"These words are from her who saith that melancholy destroyeth her and that watching wasteth her; in the murk of whose night is found no light and darkness and day are the same in her sight. She tosseth on the couch of separation and her eyes are blackened with the pencils of sleeplessness; she watcheth the stars arise and into the gloom she strains her eyes: verily, sadness and leanness have consumed her strength and the setting forth of her case would run to length. No helper hath she but tears and she reciteth these verses,\n\n'No ring dove moans from home on branch in morning light, * But\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     shakes my very frame with sorrow's killing might:\nNo lover sigheth for his love or gladdeth heart * To meet his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     mate, but breeds in me redoubled blight\nI bear my plaint to one who has no ruth for me, * Ah me, how Love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     can part man's mortal frame and sprite!' \"\nThen her eyes welled over with tears, and she wrote also these two couplets,\n\n\"Love smote my frame so sore on parting day, * That severance\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     severed sleep and eyes for aye.\nI waxt so lean that I am still a man, * But for my speaking, thou\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     wouldst never say.\"\n\nThen she shed tears and wrote at the foot of the sheet, \"This cometh from her who is far from her folk and her native land, the sorrowful hearted woman Nuzhat al-Zaman.\" In fine, she folded the sheet and gave it to the merchant, who took it and kissed it and understood its contents and exclaimed, \"Glory to Him who fashioned thee!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zaman wrote the letter and gave it to the merchant; and he took it and read it and understood the contents and exclaimed, \"Glory to Him who fashioned thee!\" Then he redoubled his kindness and made himself pleasant to her all that day, and when night came he sallied out to the bazar and bought some food, wherewith he fed her; after which he carried her to the Hammam and said to the bath woman, \"As soon as thou hast made an end of washing her head, dress her and send and let me know of it.\" And she replied \"Hearing is obeying.\" Meanwhile he fetched food and fruit and wax candles and set them on the bench in the outer room of the bath; and when the tire woman had done washing her, she dressed her and led her out of the bath and seated her on the bench. Then she sent to tell the merchant, and Nuzhat al-Zaman went forth to the outer room, where she found the tray spread with food and fruit. So she ate and the tire woman with her, and gave the rest to the people and keeper of the bath. Then she slept till the morning, and the merchant lay the night in a place apart from her. When he aroused himself from sleep he came to her and waking her, presented her with a shift of fine stuff and a head kerchief worth a thousand diners, a suit of Turkish embroidery and walking boots purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems. Moreover, he hung in each of her ears a circlet of gold with a fine pearl therein, worth a thousand diners, and threw round her neck a collar of gold with bosses of garnet and a chain of amber beads that hung down between her breasts over her navel. Now to this chain were attached ten balls and nine crescents, and each crescent had in its midst a bezel of ruby, and each ball a bezel of balass: the value of the chain was three thousand diners and each of the balls was priced at twenty thousand dirhams, so that the dress she wore was worth in all a great sum of money. When she had put these on, the merchant bade her adorn herself, and she adorned herself to the utmost beauty; then she let fall her fillet over her eyes and she fared forth with the merchant preceding her. But when folk saw her, all wondered at her beauty and exclaimed, \"Blessed be Allah, the most excellent Creator! O lucky the man in whose house the hall be!\" And the trader ceased not walking (and she behind him) till they entered the palace of Sultan Sharrkan; when he sought an audience and, kissing the earth between his hands, said, \"O auspicious King, I have brought thee a rare gift, unmatched in this time and richly gifted with beauty and with good qualities.\" Quoth the King, \"Let me see it.\" So the merchant went out and brought her, she following him till he made her stand before King Sharrkan. When he beheld her, blood yearned to blood, though she had been parted from him in childhood and though he had never seen her, having only heard a long time after her birth that he had a sister called Nuzhat al- Zaman and a brother Zau al-Makan, he having been jealous of them, because of the succession. And such was the cause of his knowing little about them. Then, having placed her before the presence, the merchant said, \"O King of the age, besides being peerless in her time and beauty and loveliness, she is also versed in all learning, sacred and profane, including the art of government and the abstract sciences.\" Quoth the King to the trader, \"Take her price, according as thou boughtest her, and go thy ways.\" \"I hear and I obey,\" replied the merchant; \"but first write me a patent, exempting me for ever from paying tithe on my merchandise.\" Said the King, \"I will do this, but first tell me what price thou paidest for her.\" Said the merchant, \"I bought her for an hundred thousand diners, and her clothes cost me another hundred thousand.\" When the Sultan heard these words, he declared, \"I will give thee a higher price than this for her;\" and, calling his treasurer, said to him, \"Pay this merchant three hundred and twenty thousand ducats; so will he have an hundred and twenty thousand diners profit.\" Thereupon the Sultan summoned the four Kazis and paid him the money in their presence and then he said, \"I call you to witness that I free this my slave girl and purpose to marry her.\" So the Kazis wrote out the deed of emancipation and the contract of marriage, when the Sultan scattered much gold on the heads of those present; and the pages and the eunuchs picked up this largesse. Then, after paying him his monies, Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a perpetual patent, exempting him from toll, tax or tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding each and every in all his government to molest him, and lastly bestowed on him a splendid dress of honour.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixtieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a mandate, after paying him his monies; and they wrote a perpetual patent, exempting him from the tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding any in his government to molest him; and lastly bestowed upon him a splendid dress of honour. Then all about him retired, and none remained save the Kazis and the merchant, whereupon said he to the judges, \"I wish you to hear such discourse from this damsel as may prove her knowledge and accomplishments in all aimed for her by this trader, that we ascertain the truth of his assertions.\" They answered, \"There is no evil in that!\"; and he commanded the curtain to be let down between him and those with him and the maiden and those with her; and the women about the damsel behind the curtains began to wish her joy and kiss her hands and feet, when they learned that she was become the King's wife. Then they came round her and took off her dresses easing her of the weight of her clothes and began to look upon her beauty and loveliness. Presently the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs heard that King Sharrkan had bought a hand maiden unmatched for her beauty and learning and philosophy and account keeping, and versed in all branches of knowledge, that he had paid for her three hundred and twenty thousand dinars, and that he had set her free and had written a marriage contract with her and had summoned the four Kazis to make trial of her, how she would answer all their questions and hold disputetion with them. So they asked leave of their husbands and repaired to the palace wherein was Nuzhat al- Zaman. When they came in to her, they found the eunuchs standing before her; and, as soon as she saw the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of the realm coming to call upon her, she arose to them on her feet and met them with courtesy, her handmaidens standing behind her, and she received them saying, \"Ye be welcome!\" The while she smiled in their faces so as to win their hearts; and she promised them all manner of good and seated them in their proper stations, as if she had been brought up with them; so all wondered at her beauty and loveliness and said to one another, \"This damsel is none other than a Queen, the daughter of a King.\" Then they sat down, magnifying her worth and said to her, \"O our lady, this our city is illumined by thee, and our country and abode and birth place and reign are honoured by thy presence. The kingdom indeed is thy kingdom and the palace is thy palace, and we all are thy handmaids; so, by Allah, do not shut us out from thy favours and the sight of thy beauty.\" And she thanked them for this. All this while the curtains were let down between Nuzhat al-Zaman and the women with her, on the one side, and King Sharrkan and the four Kazis and the merchant seated by him on the other. Presently King Sharrkan called to her and said, \"O Queen, the glory of thine age, this merchant hath described thee as being learned and accomplished; and he claimeth that thou art skilled in all branches of knowledge, even to astrology: so let us hear something of all this he hath mentioned, and favour us with a short discourse on such subjects.\" She replied, saying: \"O King, to hear is to obey.[FN#259] The first subjects whereof I will treat are the art of government and the duties of Kings and what behoveth governors of command meets according to religious law, and what is incumbent on them in respect of satisfactory speech and manners. Know then, O King, that all men's works tend either to religious or to laical life, for none attaineth to religion save through this world, because it is the best road to futurity. Now the works of this world are not ordered save by the doings of its people, and men's doings are divided into four divisions, government, commerce, husbandry and craftsmanship. Now government requireth perfect administration with just and true judgment; for government is the pivot of the edifice of the world, which world is the road to futurity; since Allah Almighty hath made the world for His servants as viaticum to the traveller for the attainment of his goal; and it befitteth each man that he receive of it such measure as shall bring him to Allah, and that he follow not herein his own mind and his individual lust. If folk would take of worldly goods with justice and equity, all cause of contention would be cut off; but they take thereof with violence ant after their own desires, and their persistence therein giveth rise to contentions; so they have need of the Sultan, that he do justice between them and order their affairs; and, if the King restrain not his folk from one another, the strong will drive the weak to the wall. Hence Ardeshir[FN#260] saith, 'Religion and Kingship be twins'; religion is a hidden treasure and the King is its keeper; and the Divine Ordinances and men's intelligence point out that it behoveth the people to adopt a Sultan who shall withhold oppressor from oppressed and do the weak justice against the strong and restrain the violence of the proud and the rebels against rule. For know, O King, that according to the measure of the Sultan's good morals, even so will be the time; as saith the Apostle of Allah (on whom be peace and salvation!), 'There be two classes who, if they be good, the people will be good; and if they be bad, the people will be bad, even the Olema and the Emirs.' And it is said by a certain sage, 'There be three kinds of Kings, the King of the Faith, the King who protecteth things to which reverence is due, and the King of his own lusts.' The King of the Faith obligeth his subjects to follow their faith, and it behoveth he be the most faithful,[FN#261] for it is by him that they take pattern in the things of the Faith; and it becometh the folk to obey him in whatso he commandeth according to Divine Ordinance; but he shall hold the discontented in the same esteem as the contented, because of submission to the decrees of Destiny. As for the King who protecteth things to be reverenced, he upholdeth the things of the Faith and of the World and compelleth his folk to follow the Divine Law and to preserve the rights of humanity; and it fitteth him to unite Pen and Sword; for whoso declineth from what Pen hath written his feet slip and the King shall rectify his error with the sharp Sword and dispread his justice over all mankind. As for the King of his own lusts, he hath no religion but the following his desire and, as he feareth not the wrath of his Lord who set him on the throne, so his Kingdom inclineth to deposition and the end of his pride is in the house of perdition. And sages say, 'The King hath need of many people, but the people have need of but one King' wherefore it beseemeth that he be well acquainted with their natures, that he reduce their discord to concord, that with his justice be encompass them all and with his bounties overwhelm them all. And know, O King, that Ardeshir, styled Jamr Shad\u00edd, or the Live Coal, third of the Kings of Persia, conquered the whole world and divided it into four divisions and, for this purpose, get for himself four seal rings, one for each division. The first seal was that of the sea and the police of prohibition and on it was written, Alterna lives. The second was the seal of tribute and of the receipt of monies, and on it was written, Building up. The third was the seal of the provisioning department and on it was written, Plenty. The fourth was the seal of the oppressed, and on it was written, Justice. And these usages remained valid in Persia until the revelation of Al-Islam. Chosro\u00ebs also wrote his son, who was with the army, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee.'\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-first night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Chosro\u00ebs wrote his son, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee; nor be thou niggardly with them, or they will murmur against thee. Give thy giving deliberately and confer thy favours advisedly; open thy hand to them in time of success and stint them not in time of distress.' There is a legend that a desert Arab came once to the Caliph Al- Mans\u00far[FN#262] and said, 'Starve thy dog and he shall follow thee.' When the Caliph heard his words, he was enraged with the Arab, but Abu 'l-Abb\u00e1s of T\u00fas said to him, 'I fear that if some other than thou should show him a scone, the dog would follow him and leave thee alone.' Thereupon the Caliph Al-Mansur's wrath subsided and he knew that the wild Arab had intended no offence and ordered him a present. And know, O King, that Abd al-Malik bin Marw\u00e1n wrote to his brother Abd al-Az\u00edz, when he despatched him to Egypt, as follows, 'Pay heed to thy Secretaries and thy Chamberlains, for the Secretaries will acquaint thee with estate fished matters and the Chamberlains with matters of official ceremony, whilst thine expenditure will make thy troops known to thee.' Omar bin Al-Khatt\u00e1b[FN#263] (whom Allah accept!) when engaging a servant was in the habit of conditioning him with four conditions; the first that he should not ride the baggage beasts, the second that he should not wear fine clothes, the third that he should not eat of the spoil and the fourth that he should not put off praying till after the proper period. It is said that there is no wealth more profitable than understanding, and there is no understanding like common sense and prudence, and there is no prudence like piety; that there is no means of drawing near to God like good morals, no measure like good breeding, no traffic like good works and no profit like earning the Divine favour; that there is no temperance like standing within the limits of the law, no science like that of meditation, no worship like obeying the Divine commends, no faith like modesty, no calculation like self abasement and no honour like knowledge. So guard the head and what it containeth and the belly and what it compriseth; and think of death and doom ere it ariseth. Saith Ali (whose face Allah honour!), 'Beware of the wickedness of women and be on thy guard against them: consult them not in aught;[FN#264] but grudge not complaisance to them, lest they greed for intrigue.' And eke quoth he, 'Whoso leaveth the path of moderation his wits become perplexed'; and there be rules for this which we will mention, if it be Allah's will. And Omar (whom Allah accept!) saith, 'There are three kinds of women, firstly the true believing, Heaven fearing, love full and fruit full, who helpeth her mate against fate, not helping fate against her mate; secondly, she who loveth her children but no more and, lastly, she who is a shackle Allah setteth on the neck of whom He will.' Men be also three: the wise when he exerciseth his own judgement; the wiser who, when befalleth somewhat whereof he knoweth not the issue, seeketh folk of good counsel and acteth by their advice; and the unwise irresolute ignoring the right way nor heeding those who would guide him straight. Justice is indispensable in all things; even slave girls have need of justice; and men quote as an instance highway robbers who live by violenting mankind, for did they not deal equitably among themselves and observe justice in dividing their booty, their order would fall to pieces.[FN#265] In short, for the rest, the Prince of noble qualities is Beneficence cum Benevolence; and how excellent is the saying of the poet,\n\nBy open hand and ruth the youth rose to his tribe's command; * Go and do likewise for the same were easy task to thee.'\n\nAnd quoth another,\n\n'In ruth and mildness surety lies and mercy wins respect, * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Truth is best asylum for the man of soothfast soul:\nWhoso for wealth of gold would win and wear the world's good\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     word, * On glory's course must ever be the first to gain the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     goal.'\"\n\nAnd Nazhat al-Zaman discoursed upon the policy of Kings till the bystanders said, \"Never have we seen one reason of rule and government like this damsel! Haply she will let us hear some discourse upon subject other than this.\" When she heard their words and understood them she said, \"As for the chapter of good breeding, it is wide of comprehension, being a compend of things perfect. Now it so happened that one day there came to the Caliph Mu'\u00e1wiyah[FN#266] one of his companions, who mentioned the people of Irak and the goodness of their wit; and the Caliph's wife Mays\u00fan, mother of Yez\u00edd, heard his words. So, when he was gone, she said to the Caliph, 'O Prince of the Faithful, I would thou let some of the people of Irak come in and talk to thee, that I may hear their discourse.' Therewith Mu'awiyah said to his attendants, 'See who is at the door?' And they answered, 'The Banu Tamim.' 'Let them come in,' said he. So they came in and with them Al-Ahn\u00e1f son of Kays.[FN#267] Then quoth Mu'awiyah, 'Enter, O Abu Bahr,' and drew a curtain between himself and Maysun, that she might hear what they said without being seen herself; then he said to Al-Ahnaf, 'O Son of the Sea, draw near and tell me what counsel thou hast for me.' Quoth Al-Ahnaf, 'Part thy hair and trim thy moustachio and pare thy nails and pluck thine armpits and shave thy pubes[FN#268] and ever use the toothstick because therein be two and seventy virtues, and make the Ghusl or complete ablution on Friday, as an expiation for all between the Fridays.'\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ahnaf bin Kays replied to Al-Mu'awiyah's[FN#269] question, 'And ever use the toothstick, because therein be two end seventy virtues and make the complete Friday ablution as an expiation for all between the two Fridays.' Quoth Mu'awiyah, 'What is thy counsel to thyself?' 'To set my feet firmly on the ground, to move them deliberately and watch over them with mine eyes!' 'How dost thou order thyself when thou goest in to one not of the nobles of thy tribe?' 'I lower mine eyes modestly and I salute first; I avoid what concerneth me not and I spare my words!' 'And how when thou goest in to thine equals?' 'I give ear to them when they speak and I do not assail them when they err!' 'When thou goest in to thy chiefs?' 'I salute without making any sign and await the reply: if they bid me draw near, I draw near, and if they draw off from me I withdraw!' 'How dost thou with thy wife?' Quoth Ahnaf, 'Excuse me from answering this, O Commander of the Faithful!'; but Mu'awiyah cried, 'I conjure thee inform me.' He said, 'I entreat her kindly and show her familiarity and am large in expenditure, for woman was created of a crooked rib.'[FN#270] 'And how dost thou when thou hast a mind to lie with her?' 'I bid her perfume herself and kiss her till she is moved to desire; then, should it be as thou knowest,[FN#271] I throw her on her back. If the seed abide in her womb I say, 'O Allah make it blessed and let it not be a wastrel, but fashion it into the best of fashions!'[FN#272] Then I rise from her to ablution and first I pour water over my hands and then over my body and lastly, I praise Allah for the joy He hath given me.' Said Mu'awiyah, 'Thou hast answered right well and now tell me what be thy requirements?' Said Ahnaf, 'I would have thee rule thy subjects in the fear of Allah and do even handed justice between them.' Thereupon Ahnaf rose to his feet and left the Caliph's presence, and when he had gone Maysun said, 'Were there but this man in Irak, he would suffice to it.' Then continued Nuzhat al-Zaman, \"And all this is a section of the chapter of good breeding, and know O King, that Muaykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khatt\u00e1b,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, \"Know, O King, that Mu'aykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khattab; and it so befel him that he saw Omar's son and gave him a dirham out of the treasury. Thereupon, quoth Mu'aykib, 'I returned to my own house, and while I was sitting there behold, a messenger came to me from Omar and I was afraid and went to him, and when I came into his presence, in his hand was the dirham I had given his son. He said to me, 'Woe to thee Mu'aykib! I have found somewhat concerning thy soul.' I asked 'And what is that?'; and he answered, 'It is that thou hast shown thyself a foe to the followers of Mohammed (on whom be peace and salvation!) in the matter of this dirham, and thou wilt have to account for it on Resurrection Day.'[FN#273] And Omar also wrote a letter to Ab\u00fa M\u00fas\u00e1 al-Ash\u00e1ri[FN#274] as follows, 'When these presents reach thee, give the people what is theirs and remit to me the rest.' And he did so. Now when Othman succeeded to the Caliphate, he wrote a like letter to Abu Musa, who did his bidding and sent him the tribute accordingly, and with it came Ziy\u00e1d.[FN#275] And when Ziyad laid the tribute before Othman, the Caliph's son came in and took a dirham, whereupon Ziyad shed tears. Othman asked 'Why weepest thou?'; and Ziyad answered, 'I once brought Omar bin al-Khattab the like of this and his son took a dirham, where upon Omar bade snatch it from his hand. Now thy son hath taken of the tribute, yet I have seen none say aught to him or snatch the money from him.' Then Othman[FN#276] cried, 'And where wilt thou find the like of Omar?' Again Zayd bin Aslam relates of his father that he said, 'I went out one night with Omar till we approached a blazing fire. Quoth Omar, 'O Aslam, I think these must be travellers who are suffering from the cold. Come, let us join them.' So we walked on till we came to them and behold! we found a woman who had lighted a fire under a cauldron and by her side were two children, both a wailing. Said Omar, 'Peace be with you, O folk of light (for it was repugnant to him to say 'folk of fire'),[FN#277] what aileth you?' Said she, 'The cold and the night trouble us.' He asked, 'What aileth these little people that they weep?'; and she answered, 'They are hungry.' He enquired, 'And what is in this cauldron?'; and she replied, 'It is what I quiet them withal, and Allah will question Omar bin al- Khattab of them, on the Day of Doom.' He said, 'And what should Omar know of their case?' 'Why then,' rejoined she, 'should he manage people's affairs and yet be unmindful of them?' Thereupon Omar turned to me (continned Aslam) and cried, 'Come with us!' So we set off running till we reached the pay department of his treasury, where he took out a sack containing flour and a pot holding fat and said to me, 'Load these on my back!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I will carry them for thee.' He rejoined, 'Wilt thou bear my load for me on the Day of Resurrection?' So I put the things on his back, and we set off, running, till we threw down the sack hard by her. Then he took out some of the flour and put it in the cauldron; and, saying to the woman, 'Leave it to me,' he began blowing the fire under the cauldron. Now he was a long bearded man[FN#278] and I saw the smoke issuing from between the hairs of his beard till the flour was cooked, when he took some of the fat and threw it in and said to the woman, 'Bed them while I cool it for them.' So they fell to eating till they had eaten their fill, and he left the rest with her. Then he turned to me and said, 'O Aslam, I see it was indeed hunger made them weep; and I am glad I did not go away ere I found out the cause of the light I saw.'\u2014And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, \"It is related that Omar passed by a flock of sheep, kept by a Mameluke, and asked him to sell him a sheep. He answered, 'They are not mine.' 'Thou art the man I sought,' said Omar, and bought him and freed him; whereupon the slave exclaimed, 'O Allah, as thou hast bestowed on me the lesser emancipation; so vouchsafe me the greater!'[FN#279] It is also said that Omar bin al- Khattab was wont to give his servants sweet milk and himself eat coarse fare, and to clothe them softly and himself wear rough garments. He rendered unto all men their due, and exceeded in his giving to them. He once gave a man four thousand dirhams and added thereto a thousand, wherefore it was said to him, 'Why dost thou not increase to thy son as thou increasest to this man?' He answered, 'This man's father stood firm at the battle day of Ohod.'[FN#280] Al-Hasan relates that Omar once came back from foray with much money, and that Hafsah[FN#281] approached him and said, 'O Commander of the Faithful, the due of kinship!' 'O Hafsah!' replied he, 'verily Allah hath enjoined us to satisfy the dues of kinship, but not with the monies of the True Believers. Indeed, thou pleasest\" thy family, but thou angerest thy father.' And she went away trailing her skirts.[FN#282] The son of Omar said, 'I implored the Lord to show me my father one year after his death, till at last I saw him wiping the sweat from his brow and asked him, 'How is it with thee, O my father?' He answered, 'But for my Lord's mercy thy father surely had perished.' Then said Nuzhat al-Zaman, \"Hear, O auspicious King, the second division of the first chapter of the instances of the followers of the Apostle and other holy men. Saith Al Hasan al-Basr\u00ed,[FN#283] Not a soul of the sons of Adam goeth forth of the world without regretting three things,- failure to enjoy what he hath amassed, failure to compass what he hoped, failure to provide himself with sufficient viaticum for that hereto he goeth.[FN#284] It was said of Sufyan,[FN#285] 'Can a man be a religious and yet possess wealth?' He replied, 'Yes, so he be patient when grieved and be thankful when he hath received.' Abdullah bin Shadd\u00e1d, being about to die, sent for his son Mohammed and admonished him, saying, 'O my son, I see the Summoner of Death summoning me, and so I charge thee to fear Allah both in public and private, to praise Allah and to be soothfastin thy speech, for such praise bringeth increase of prosperity, and piety in itself is the best of provision for the next world; even as saith one of the poets,\n\n'I see not happiness lies in gathering gold; * The man most pious\nis man happiest:\nIn truth the fear of God is best of stores, * And God shall make\nthe pious choicely blest.'\nThen quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, \"Let the King also give ear to these notes from the second section of the first chapter.\" He asked her 'What be they?'; and she answered, \"When Omar bin Abd al-Az\u00edz[FN# 286] succeeded to the Caliphate, he went to his household and laying hands on all that was in their hold, put it into the public treasury. So the Banu Umayyah flew for aid to his father's sister, F\u00e1timah, daughter of Marwan, and she sent to him saying, 'I must needs speak to thee.' So she came to him by night and, when he had made her alight from her beast and sit down, he said to her, 'O aunt, it is for thee to speak first, since thou hast some thing to ask: tell me then what thou wouldst with me.' Replied she, 'O Commander of the Faithful, it is thine to speak first, for thy judgment perceiveth that which is hidden from the intelligence of others.' Then said Omar, 'Of a verity Allah Almighty sent Mohammed as a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him, and commissioned him as His Apostle and took him to Himself,'\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued thus, \"Said Omar, 'Verily Allah commissioned as His Apostle Mohammed (upon whom be the benediction of Allah and His salvation!), for a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him and took him to Himself, leaving the people a stream whereof they might drink. After him Abu Bakr[FN#287] the Truth teller became Caliph and he left the river as it was, doing what was pleasing to Allah. Then arose Omar and worked a work and strove in holy war and strife where of none might do the like. But when Othman arose to power he diverted a streamlet from the stream, and Mu'awiyah in his turn diverted from it several streamlets; and without ceasing in like manner, Yezid and the Banu Marw\u00e1n such as Abd al-Malik and Wal\u00edd and Sulaym\u00e1n[FN#288] drew away water from the stream, and the main course dried up, till rule devolved upon me, and now I am minded to restore the stream to its normal condition.' When Fatimah heard this, she said, 'I came wishing only to speak and confer with thee, but if this be thy word, I have nothing to say to thee.' Then she returned to the Ommiades and said to them, 'Now take ye the consequences of your act when ye allied yourselves by marriage with Omar bin al-Khattab.'[FN#289] And it is also said that when Omar was about to die, he gathered his children round him, and Maslamah[FN#290] bin Abd al-Malik said to him, 'O Prince of the Faithful, how wilt thou leave thy children paupers and thou their protector? None can hinder thee in thy lifetime from giving them what will suffice them out of the treasury; and this indeed were better than leaving the good work to him who shall rule after thee.' Omar looked at him with a look of wrath and wonder and presently replied, 'O Maslamah, I have defended them from this sin all the days of my life, and shall I make them miserable after my death? Of a truth my sons are like other men, either obedient to Almighty Allah who will prosper them, or disobedient and I will not help them in their disobedience. Know, O Maslamah, that I was present, even as thou, when such an one of the sons of Marwanwas buried, and I fell asleep by him and saw him in a dream given over to one of the punishments of Allah, to whom belong Honour and Glory! This terrified me and made me tremble, and I vowed to Allah, that if ever I came to power, I would not do such deeds as the dead man had done. I have striven to fulfil this vow all the length of my life and I hope to die in the mercy of my Lord.' Quoth Maslamah, 'A certain man died and I was present at his burial, and when all was over I fell asleep and I saw him as a sleeper seeth a dream, walking in a garden of flowing waters clad in white clothes. He came up to me and said: 'O Maslamah, it is for the like of this that rulers should rule.' Many are the instances of this kind, and quoth one of the men of authority, 'I used to milk the ewes in the Caliphate of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz, and one day I met a shepherd, among whose sheep I saw a wolf or wolves. I thought them to be dogs, for I had never before seen wolves; so I asked, 'What dost thou with these dogs?' 'They are not dogs, but wolves,' answered the shepherd. Quoth I, 'Can wolves be with sheep and not hurt them?' Quoth he, 'When the head is whole, the body is whole.'[FN#291] Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once preached from a pulpit of clay and, after praising and glorifying Allah Almighty, said three words as follows, 'O folk, make clean your inmost hearts, that your outward lives may be dean to your brethren, and abstain ye from the things of the world. Know that between us and Adam there is no one man alive among the dead. Dead are Abd al- Malik and those who forewent him, and Omar also shall die and those who forewent him.' Asked Maslamah, 'O Commander of the Faithful, an we set a pillow behind thee, wilt thou lean on it a little while?' But Omar answered, 'I fear lest it be a fault about my neck on Resurrection Day.' Then he gasped with the death rattle and fell back in a faint; whereupon Fatimah cried out, saying, 'Ho, Maryam! Ho, Muzahim![FN#292] Ho, such an one! Look to this man!' And she began to pour water on him weeping, till he revived from his swoon; and, seeing her in tears said to her, 'What causeth thee to weep, O Fatimah?' She replied, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I saw thee lying prostrate before us and thought of thy prostration in death before Almighty Allah, of thy departure from the world and of thy separation from us. This is what made me weep.' Answered he, 'Enough, O Fatimah, for indeed thou exceedest.' Then he would have risen, but fell down and Fatimah strained him to her and said, 'Thou art to me as my father and my mother, O Commander of the Faithful! We cannot speak to thee, all of us.' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, \"Here endeth the second section of the first chapter.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman said to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, \"Here endeth the second section of the first chapter. And it so happened that Omar bin Abd al-Aziz wrote to the people of the festival at Meccah as follows, 'I call Allah to witness, in the Holy Month, in the Holy City and on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage,[FN#293] that I am innocent of your oppression and of his wrongs that doth wrong you, in that I have neither commanded this nor purposed it, neither hath any report of aught thereof hitherto reached me, nor have I compassed any knowledge thereof; and I trust that a cause for pardon will be found in that none hath authority from me to oppress any man, for I shall assuredly be questioned concerning every one oppress. And if any of my officers swerve from the right and act otherwise than the Holy Book and the Traditions of the Apostle do authorise, obey him not so that he may return to the way of righteousness.' He said also (Allah accept of him!), 'I do not wish to be relieved from death, because it is the supreme thing for which the True Believer is rewarded.' Quoth one of authority, 'I went to the Prince of the Faithful, Omarbin Abd al-Aziz, who was then Caliph, and saw before him twelve dirhams, which he ordered for deposit in the public treasury. So I said to him, 'O Commander of the Faithful, thou impoverishest thy children and reducest them to beggary having nothing whereon to live. An thou wouldst appoint somewhat by will to them and to those who are poor of the people of thy house, it were well.' 'Draw near to me,' answered he: so I drew near to him and he said, 'Now as for thy saying, 'Thou beggarest thy children; provide for them and for the poor of thy household,' it is without reason; for Allah of a truth will replace me to my children and to the poor of my house, and He will be their guardian. Verily, they are like other men; he who feareth Allah, right soon will Allah provide for him a happy issue, and he that is addicted to sins, I will not up hold him in his sin against Allah.' Then he summoned his sons who numbered twelve, and when he beheld them his eyes dropped tears and presently he said to them, 'Your Father is between two things; either ye will be well to do, and your parent will enter the fire, or ye will be poor and your parent will enter Paradise; and your father's entry into Paradise is liefer to him than that ye should be well to do.[FN#294] So arise and go, Allah be your helper, for to Him I commit your affairs!' Kh\u00e1lid bin Safw\u00e1n[FN#295] said, 'Y\u00fasuf bin Omar[FN#296] accompanied me to Hish\u00e1m bin Abd al-Malik,[FN#297] and as I met him he was coming forth with his kinsmen and attendants. He alighted and a tent was pitched for him. When the people had taken their seats, I came up to the side of the carpet whereon he sat reclining and looked at him; and, waiting till my eyes met his eyes, bespoke him thus, 'May Allah fulfil His bounty to thee, O Commander of the Faithful, I have an admonition for thee, which hath come down to us from the history of the Kings preceding thee!' At this, he sat up whenas he had been reclining and said to me, 'Bring what thou hast, O son of Safwan!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, one of the Kings before thee went forth in a time before this thy time, to this very country and said to his companions, 'Saw ye ever any state like mine and say me, hath such case been given to any man even as it hath been given unto me?' Now there was with him a man of those who survive to bear testimony to Truth; upholders of the Right and wayfarers in its highway, and he said to him, 'O King, thou askest of a grave matter. Wilt thou give me leave to answer?' 'Yes,' replied the King, and the other said, 'Dost thou judge thy present state to be short lasting or ever lasting?' 'It is temporary,' replied the King. 'How then,' rejoined the man, 'do I see thee exulting in that which thou wilt enjoy but a little while and whereof thou wilt be questioned for a long while and for the rendering an account whereof thou shalt be as a pledge which is pawned?' Quoth the King, 'Whither shall I flee and what must I seek for me?' 'That thou abide in thy kingship,' replied the other, 'or else robe thee in rags[FN#298] and apply thyself to obey Almighty Allah thy Lord until thine appointed hour. I will come to thee again at daybreak.' Khalid bin Safwan further relates that the man knocked at the door at dawn and behold, the King had put off his crown and resolved to become an anchorite, for the stress of his exhortation. When Hish\u00e1m bin Abd al-Malik heard this, he wept till his beard was wet, and, bidding his rich apparel be put off, shut himself up in his palace. Then the grandees and dependents came to Khalid and said, 'What is this thou hast done with the Commander of the Faithful? Thou hast troubled his pleasure and disturbed his life!' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, addressing herself to Sharrkan, \"How many instances of admonition are there not in this chapter! Of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, speaking to Sharrkan, \"Know, O King, that in this chapter be so many instances of admonition that of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting but, with length of days, O King of the age, all will be well.\" There said the Kazis, \"O King, of a truth this damsel is the wonder of the world, and of our age the unique pearl! Never heard we her like in the length of time or in the length of our lives.\" And they called down blessings on the King and went away. Then Sharrkan turned to his attendants and said, \"Begin ye to prepare the marriage festival and make ready food of all kinds.\" So they forthright did his bidding as regards the viands, and he commanded the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees depart not until the time of the wedding banquet and of the unveiling of the bride. Hardly came the period of afternoon prayer when the tables were spread with whatso heart can desire or eye can delight in of roast meats and geese and fowls; and the subjects ate till they were satisfied. Moreover, Sharrkan had sent for all the singing women of Damascus and they were present, together with every slave girl of the King and of the notables who knew how to sing. And they went up to the palace in one body. When the evening came and darkness starkened they lighted candles, right and left, from the gate of the citadel to that of the palace; and the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees marched past before King Sharrkan, whilst the singers and the tire women took the damsel to dress and adorn her, but found she needed no adornment. Meantime King Sharrkan went to the Hammam and coming out, sat down on his seat of estate, whilst they paraded the bride before him in seven different dresses: after which they eased her of the weight of her raiment and ornaments and gave such injunctions as are enjoined upon virgins on their wedding nights. Then Sharrkan went in unto her and took her maidenhead;[FN#299] and she at once conceived by him and, when she announced it, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and commanded the savants to record the date of her conception. On the morrow he went forth and seated himself on his throne, and the high officers came in to him and gave him joy. Then he called his private secretary and bade him write a letter to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, saying that he had bought him a damsel, who excels in learning and good breeding and who is mistress of all kinds of knowledge. Moreover he wrote, \"There is no help but that I send her to Baghdad to visit my brother Zau al-Makan and my sister Nuzhat al-Zaman. I have set her free and married her and she hath conceived by me.\" And he went on to praise her wit and salute his brother and sister together with the Wazir Dandan and all the Emirs. Then he sealed the letter and despatched it to his father by a post courier who was absent a whole month, after which time he returned with the answer and presented it in the presence. Sharrkan took it and read as follows, \"After the usual Bismillah, this is from the afflicted distracted man, from him who hath lost his children and home by bane and ban, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, to his son Sharrkan. Know that, since thy departure from me, the place is become contracted upon me, so that no longer I have power of patience nor can I keep my secret: and the cause thereof is as follows. It chanced that when I went forth to hunt and course Zau al-Makan sought my leave to fare Hijaz wards, but I, fearing for him the shifts of fortune, forbade him therefrom until the next year or the year after. My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-eighth night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman wrote in his letter, \"My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month, and when I returned I found that thy brother and sister had taken somewhat of money and had set out with the pilgrim caravan for pilgrimage by stealth. When I knew this, the wide world narrowed on me, O my son! but I awaited the return of the caravan, hoping that haply they would come back with it. Accordingly, when the palmers appeared I asked concerning the twain, but they could give me no news of them; so I donned mourning for them, being heavy at heart, and in sleep I have no part and I am drowned in the tears of my eyes.\" Then he wrote in verse,\n\n\"That pair in image quits me not one single hour, * Whom in my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     heart's most honourable place I keep:\nSans hope of their return I would not live one hour, * Without my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     dreams of them I ne'er would stretch me in sleep.\"\n\nThe letter went on, \"And after the usual salutations to thee and thine, I command thee neglect no manner of seeking news of them for indeed this is a shame to us.\" When Sharrkan read the letter he felt grief for his father and joy for the loss of his brother and sister. Then he took the missive and went in with it to Nuzhat al-Zaman who knew not that he was her brother, nor he that she was his sister, albeit he often visited her both by night and by day till the months were accomplished and she sat down on the stool of delivery. Allah made the child birth easy to her and she bare a daughter, whereupon she sent for Sharrkan and seeing him she said to him, \"This is thy daughter: name her as thou wilt.\" Quoth he, \"It is usual to name children on the seventh day after birth.[FN#300]\" Then he bent over the child to kiss it and he saw, hung about its neck, a jewel, which he knew at once for one of those which Princess Abrizah had brought from the land of the Greeks. Now when he saw the jewel hanging from his babe's neck he recognised it right well, his senses fled and wrath seized on him; his eyes rolled in rage and he looked at Nuzhat al- Zaman and said to her, \"Whence hadst thou this jewel, O slave girl?\" When she heard this from Sharrkan she replied, \"I am thy lady, and the lady of all in thy palace! Art thou not ashamed to say to me Slave girl? I am a Queen, daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman.\" Hearing this, he was seized with trembling and hung his head earthwards,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart fluttered and his colour waxed yellow and he was seized with trembling and he hung his head earthwards, for he knew that she was his sister by the same father. Then he lost his senses; and, when he revived, he abode in amazement, but did not discover his identity to her and asked, O my lady, say, art thou in sooth the daughter of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman?\" \"Yes,\" answered she; and he continued, \"Tell me the cause of thy leaving thy sire and of thy being sold for a slave.\" So she related to him all that had befallen her from beginning to end, how she had left her brother sick in the Sanctified City, Jerusalem, and how the Badawi had kidnapped her and had sold her to the trader. When Sharrkan heard this, he was certified of her being his sister on the sword side and said to himself, \"How can I have my sister to wife? By Allah, needs must I marry her to one of my chamberlains; and, if the thing get wind, I will declare that I divorced her before consummation and married her to my Chief Chamberlain.\" Then he raised his head and sighing said, \"O Nuzhat al-Zaman, thou art my very sister and I cry: 'I take refuge with Allah from this sin whereinto we have fallen,' for I am Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman.\" She looked at him and knew he spoke the truth; and, becoming as one demented, she wept and buffeted her face, exclaiming, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! Verily have we fallen into mortal sin![FN#301] What shall I do and what shall I say to my father and my mother when they ask me, Whence hadst thou thy daughter?\" Quoth Sharrkan, \"It were meetest that I marry thee to my Chamberlain and let thee bring up my daughter in his house, that none may know thou be my sister. This hath befallen us from Almighty Allah for a purpose of his own, and nothing shall cover us but thy marriage with this Chamberlain, ere any know.\" Then he fell to comforting her and kissing her head and she asked him, \"What wilt thou call the girl?\" \"Call her Kuzia Fak\u00e1n,\"[FN#302] answered he. Then he gave the mother in marriage to the Chief Chamberlain, and transferred her to his house with the child, which they reared on the laps of the slave girls, and fed with milk and dosed with powders. Now all this occurred whilst the brother, Zau al-Makan, still tarried with the Fireman at Damascus. One day there came to King Sharrkan a courier from his father, with a letter which he took and read and found therein, \"After the Bismillah know, O beloved King, that I am afflicted with sore affliction for the loss of my children: sleep ever faileth me and wakefulness ever assaileth me. I send thee this letter that, as soon as thou receivest it, thou make ready the monies and the tribute, and send them to us, together with the damsel whom thou hast bought and taken to wife; for I long to see her and hear her discourse; more especially because there hath come to us from Roumland an old woman of saintly bearing and with her be five damsels high bosomed virgins, endowed with knowledge and good breeding and all arts and sciences befitting mortals to know; and indeed tongue faileth me to describe this old woman and these who with her wend; for of a truth they are compendiums of perfections in learning and accomplishments. As soon as I saw them I loved them, and I wished to have them in my palace and in the compass of my hand; for none of the Kings owneth the like of them; so I asked the old woman their price and she answered, 'I will not sell them but for the tribute of Damascus.' And I, by Allah, did not hold this price exorbitant, indeed it is but little, for each one of them is worth the whole valuation. So I agreed to that and took them into my palace, and they remain in my possession. Wherefore do thou forward the tribute to us that the woman may return to her own country; and send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors; and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied by the tribute of Baghdad.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar son of Al-Nu'uman said in his letter, \"And send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied with the tribute of Baghdad.\" As soon as Sharrkan knew the contents, he went in to his brother in law and said to him, \"Bring the damsel to whom I married thee;\" and when she came he showed her the letter and said, \"O my sister! what answer wouldst thou advise me make to this letter?\" Replied she, \"Seek advice from thyself!\" and presently added (for she yearned after her people and her native land), \"Send me together with my husband the Chamberlain, to Baghdad, that I may tell my father my tale and let him know whatso befel me with the Badawi who sold me to the merchant, and that I also inform him how thou boughtest me of the trader and gavest me in marriage to the Chamberlain, after setting me free.\" \"Be it so,\" replied Sharrkan. Then Sharrkan took his daughter, Kuzia Fakan, and committed her to the charge of the wet nurses and the eunuchs, and he made ready the tribute in haste, bidding the Chamberlain travel with the Princess and the treasure to Baghdad. He also furnished him two travelling litters one for himself and the other for his wife. And the Chamberlain replied, \"To hear is to obey.\" Moreover Sharrkan collected camels and mules and wrote a letter to his father and committed it to the Chamberlain; then he bade farewell to his sister, after he had taken the jewel from her and hung it round his daughter's neck by a chain of pure gold; and she and her husband set out for Baghdad the same night. Now it so happened that Zau al-Makan and his friend the Fireman had come forth from the hut in which they were, to see the spectacle, and they beheld camels and Bukhti[FN#303] dromedaries and b\u00e2t-mules and torches and lanterns alight; and Zau al-Makan enquired about the loads and their owner and was told that it was the tribute of Damascus going to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of the City of Baghdad. He then asked, \"Who be the leader of the caravan?\" and they answered, \"The Head Chamberlain who hath married the damsel so famous for learning and science.\" Thereupon Zau al-Makan wept with bitter weeping and was minded of his mother and his father and his sister and his native land, and he said to the Stoker, \"I will join this caravan and, little by little, will journey homewards.\" Quoth the Fireman, \"I would not suffer thee to travel single handed from the Holy City to Damascus, then how shall I be sure of thy safety when thou farest for Baghdad? But I will go with thee and care for thee till thou effectest thine object.\" \"With joy and good will,\" answered Zau al-Makan. Then the Fireman get him ready for the journey and hired an ass and threw saddle bags over it and put therein something of provaunt; and, when all was prepared, he awaited the passage of the caravan. And presently the Chamberlain came by on a dromedary and his footmen about him. Then Zau al-Ma ken mounted the ass and said to his companion, \"Do thou mount with me.\" But he replied, \"Not so: I will be thy servant.\" Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"There is no help for it but thou ride awhile.\" \"'Tis well,\" quoth the Stoker; \"I will ride when I grow tired.\" Then said Zau al-Makan, \"O my brother, soon shalt thou see how I will deal with thee, when I come to my own folk.\" So they fared on till the sun rose and,When it was the hour of the noonday sleep[FN#304] the Chamberlain called a halt and they alighted and reposed and watered their camels. Then he gave the signal for departure and, after five days, they came to the city of Ham\u00e1h,[FN#305] where they set down and made a three days' halt;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they halted in the city of Hamah three days; they then fared forwards and ceased not travelling till they reached another city. Here also they halted three days and thence they travelled till they entered the province Diy\u00e1r Bakr. Here blew on them the breezes of Baghdad, and Zau al-Makan bethought him of his father and mother and native land, and how he was returning to his sire without his sister: so he wept and sighed and complained, and his regrets grew on him, and he began improvising these couplets,\n\n\"Sweetheart! How long must I await by so long suffering teed? *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Nor cometh messenger to tell me where thou dost abide:\nAh me! in very sooth our meeting time was short enow: * Would\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Heaven shorter prove to me the present parting-tide!\nNow trend my hand and open my robe and thou within shall sight *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    How wasted are the limbs of me and yet the waste I hide:\nWhen say they 'Comfort take for loss of love' I but reply * 'By\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Allah, till the Day of Doom no comfort shall betide!' \"\n\nThereupon said to him the Fireman, \"Leave this weeping and wailing, for we are near the Chamberlain's tent.\" Quoth Zau al- Makan, \"Needs must I recite somewhat of verse; haply it may quench the fire of my heart.\" \"Allah upon thee,\" cried the other, \"cease this lamentation till thou come to shine own country; then do what thou wilt, and I will be with thee wherever thou art.\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"By Allah! I cannot forbear from this!\" Then he turned his face towards Baghdad and the moon was shining brightly and shedding her light on the place, and Nuzhat al-Zaman could not sleep that night, but was restless and called to mind her brother and wept. And while she was in tears, he heard Zau al-Makan weeping and improvising the following distichs,\n\n'Al-Yaman's[FN#306] leven-gleam I see, * And sore despair\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    despaireth me\nFor friend who erst abode wi' me * Crowning my cup with gladdest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   gree:\nIt minds me o' one who jilted me * To mourn my bitter liberty.\nSay sooth, thou fair sheet lightning! shall * We meet once more\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   in joy and glee?\nO blamer! spare to me thy blame * My Lord hath sent this dule to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    dree,\nOf friend who left me, fain to flee; * Of Time that breeds\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    calamity:\nAll bliss hath fled the heart of me * Since Fortune proved mine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    enemy.\nHe[FN#307] brimmed a bowl of merest pine, * And made me drain the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    dregs, did he:\nI see me, sweetheart, dead and gone * Ere I again shall gaze on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   thee.\nTime! prithee bring our childhood back, * Restore our happy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    infancy,\nWhen joy and safety 'joyed we * From shafts that now they shoot\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    at me!\nWho aids the hapless stranger wight, * That nights in fright and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    misery,\nThat wastes his days in lonely grief, * For 'Time's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Delight'[FN#308] no more must be?\nDoomed us despite our will to bear * The hands of base bores cark\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     and care.\"\n\nWhen he ended his verse he cried out and fell down in a fainting fit. This is how it fared with him; but as regards Nuzhat al- Zaman, when she heard that voice in the night, her heart was at rest and she rose and in her joy she called the Chief Eunuch, who said to her, \"What is thy will?\" Quoth she, \"Arise and bring me him who recited verses but now.\" Replied he, \"Of a truth I did not hear him\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat Al-Zaman heard her brother reciting, she called the Chief Eunuch and said to him, \"Go, fetch me the man who is repeating this poetry!\" Replied he, \"Of a truth I heard him not and I wot him not and folks are all sleeping.\" But she said, \"Whomsoever thou seest awake, he is the reciter.\" So he went, yet found none on wake save the Stoker; for Zau al-Makan was still insensible, and when his companion saw the Eunuch standing by his head he was afraid of him. Then said the Eunuch, \"Art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him?\" The Stoker fancied that the dame was wroth with the reciter; and, being afraid, he replied, \"By Allah, 'twas not I!\" Rejoined the Eunuch, \"Who then was the reciter?: point him out to me. Thou must know who it was, seeing that thou art awake.\" The Fireman feared for Zau al- Makan and said in himself, \"Haply the Eunuch will do him some hurt\"; so he answered, \"By Allah, I know not who it was.\" Said the Eunuch, \"By Allah, thou liest, for there is none on wake here but thou! So needs must thou know him.\" \"By Allah,\" replied the Fireman, \"I tell thee the truth!: some passer by, some wayfarer must have recited the verses and disturbed me and kept me awake; Allah requite him!\" Quoth the Eunuch, \"If thou happen upon him, point him out to me and I will lay hands on him and bring him to the door of our lady's litter[FN#309] or do thou take him with thine own hand.\" Said the Fireman, \"Go thou back and I will bring him to thee.\" So the Eunuch left him and went his ways; and, going in to his mistress, told her all this and said to her, \"None knoweth who it was; it must have been some passer by, some wayfarer.\" And she was silent. Meanwhile, Zau al-Makan came to himself and saw that the moon had reached the middle Heavens; the breath of the dawn breeze[FN#310] breathed upon him and his heart was moved to longing and sadness; so he cleared his throat and was about to recite verses, when the Fire man asked him, \"What wilt thou do?\" Answered Zau al-Makan, \"I have a mind to repeat somewhat of poetry, that I may quench therewith the fire of my heart.\" Quoth the other, \"Thou knowest not what befel me whilst thou wast a faint, and how I escaped death only by beguiling the Eunuch.\" \"Tell me what happened,\" quoth Zau al-Makan. Replied the Stoker, \"Whilst thou wast aswoon there came up to me but now an Eunuch, with a long staff of almond tree wood in his hand, who took to looking in all the people's faces, as they lay asleep, and asked me who it was recited the verses, finding none awake but myself. I told him in reply it was some passerby, some wayfarer; so he went away and Allah delivered me from him; else had he killed me. But first he said to me, 'If thou hear him again, bring him to us.'\" When Zau al-Makan heard this he wept and said, \"Who is it would forbid me to recite? I will surely recite, befal me what may; for I am near mine own land and care for none.\" Rejoined the Fireman, \"Thy design is naught save to lose thy life;\" and Zau al-Makan retorted, \"Needs must I recite verses.\" \"Verily,\" said the Stoker, \"needs must there be a parting between me and thee in this place, albeit;I had intended not to leave thee, till I had brought thee to thy native city and reunited thee with thy mother and father. Thou hast now tarried with me a year and a half and I have never harmed thee in aught. What ails thee, then, that thou must needs recite verses, seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep, for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue?\" But Zau al-Makan answered, \"I will not be turned away from my purpose.\"[FN#311] Then grief moved him and he threw off concealment and began repeating these couplets,\n\n\"Stand thou by the homes and hail the lords of the ruined stead;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  * Cry thou for an answer, belike reply to thee shall be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   sped:\nIf the night and absence irk thy spirit kindle a torch * Wi'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   repine; and illuminate the gloom with a gleaming greed:\nIf the snake of the sand dunes hiss, I shall marvel not at all!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   * Let him bite so I bite those beauteous lips of the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   luscious red:\nO Eden, my soul hath fled in despite of the maid I love: * Had I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   lost hope of Heaven my heart in despair were dead.\"\nAnd he also improvised the two following distichs,\n\n\"We were and were the days enthralled to all our wills, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Dwelling in union sweet and homed in fairest site:\nWho shall restore the home of the beloved, where showed * Light\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    of the Place for aye conjoined with Time's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Delight?''[FN#312]\n\nAnd as he ceased his verses, he shrieked three shrieks and fell senseless to the ground and the Fireman rose and covered him. When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard the first improvisation, she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilome home; then she wept and cried at the Eunuch and said to him, \"Woe to thee! He who recited the first time hath recited a second time and I heard him hard by. By Allah, an thou fetch him not to me, I will assuredly rouse the Chamberlain on thee, and he shall beat thee and cast thee out. But take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently, and do him no hurt. If he refuse, hand to him this purse of a thousand diners, then leave him and return to me and tell me, after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is. Return quickly and linger not.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman sent the Eunuch to make enquiries concerning the singer and said, \"Beware how thou come back to me and report, I could not find him.\" So the Eunuch went out and laid about the people and trod in their tents, but found none awake, all being asleep for weariness, till he came to the Stoker and saw him sitting up, with his head uncovered. So he drew near and seizing him by the hand, said to him, \"It was thou didst recite the verses!\" The Fireman was afeard for his life and replied, \"No, by Allah, O chief of the people, it was not I!\" But the Eunuch said, \"I will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses, for I dread returning to my lady without him.\" Now when the Fireman heard these words he feared for Zau al-Makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the Eunuch, \"By Allah, it was not I, and I know him not. I only heard some passer by, some wayfarer, recite verses: so do not thou commit sin on me, for I am a stranger and come from the Holy City of Jerusalem; and Abraham, the friend of Allah, be with you all.\" \"Rise up and fare with me,\" rejoined the Eunuch, \"and tell my lady this with thine own mouth, for I have seen none awake save thyself.\" Quoth the Stoker, \"Hast thou not come and seen me sitting in the place where I now am, and dost thou not know my station? Thou wottest none can stir from his place, except the watchman seize him. So go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry, whether he be near or far, it will be I or some one I know, and thou shalt not learn of him but by me.\" Then he kissed the Eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away; but the Castrato fetched a round and, returning secretly, came and stood behind the Fireman, fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings. As soon as he was gone, the Stoker arose and aroused Zau al-Makan and said to him, \"Come, sit up, that I may tell thee what hath happened.\" So Zau al-Makan sat up, and his companion told him what had passed, and he answered, \"Let me alone; I will take no heed of this and I care for none, for I am mine own country.\"[FN#313] Quoth the Stoker, \"Why wilt thou obey thy flesh and the devil? If thou fear no one, I fear for thee and for my life, so Allah upon thee! recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land. Indeed, I had not deemed thee so ill conditioned. Dost thou not know that this lady is the wife; of the Chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her? Belike, she is ill or restless for fatigue of the journey and the distance of the place from her home, and this is the second time she hath sent the Eunuch to look for thee.\" However Zau al-Makan paid no heed to the Fireman's words but cried out a third time and began versifying with these couplets,\n\n\"I fly the carper's injury,* Whose carping sorely vexeth me:\nHe chides and taunts me, wotting not * He burns me but more\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    grievously.\nThe blamer cries 'He is consoled!' * I say, 'My own dear\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    land[FN#314] to see:'\nThey ask, 'Why be that land so dear?' * I say, 'It taught me in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    love to be:'\nThey ask, 'What raised its dignity?' * I say, 'What made my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ignomy:'\nWhate'er the bitter cup I drain, * Far be fro' me that land to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     flee:\nNor will I bow to those who blame, * And for such love would deal\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     me shame.\n\nHardly had he made an end of his verses and come to a conclusion, when the Eunuch (who had heard him from his hiding place at his head) came up to him; whereupon the Fireman flea end stood afar off to see what passed between them. Then said the Eunuch to Zau al-Makan, \"Peace be with thee, O my lord!\" \"And on thee be peace,\" replied Zau al-Makan, \"and the mercy of Allah and His blessings!\" \"O my lord,\" continued the Eunuch\u2014-And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Eunuch said to Zau al-Makan, \"O my lord, I have sought thee these several times this night, for my mistress biddeth thee to her.\" Quoth Zau al- Makan, \"And who be this bitch that seeketh for me? Allah curse her and curse her husband with her!\"[FN#315] And he began to revile the Eunuch, who could make him no answer, because his mistress had charged him to do Zau al-Makan no hurt, nor bring him save of his own especial free will; and, if he would not accompany him, to give him the thousand diners. So the Castrato began to speak him fair and say to him, \"O my lord, take this purse and go with me. We will do thee no upright, O my son, nor wrong thee in aught; but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress, to receive her answer and return in weal and safety: and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news.\" When Zau al- Makan heard this, he arose and went with the Eunuch and walked among the sleeping folk, stepping over them; whilst the Fireman followed after them from afar, and kept his eye upon him and said to himself, \"Alas the pity of his youth! Tomorrow they will hang him.\" And he ceased not following them till he approached their station,[FN#316] without any observing him. Then he stood still and said, \"How base it will be of him, if he say it was I who bade him recite the verses!\" This was the case of the Stoker; but as regards what befel Zau al-Makan, he ceased not walking with the Eunuch till he reached his station and the Castrato went in to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said, \"O my lady, I have brought thee him whom thou soughtest, and he is a youth, fair of face and bearing the marks of wealth and gentle breeding.\" When she heard this, her heart fluttered and she cried, \"Let him recite some verses, that I may hear him near hand, and after ask him his name and his condition and his native land.\" Then the Eunuch went out to Zau al-Makan and said to him, \"Recite what verses thou knowest, for my lady is here hard by, listening to thee, and after I will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition.\" Replied he, \"With love and gladness but, an thou ask my name, it is erased and my trace is unplaced and my body a waste. I have a story, the beginning of which is not known nor can the end of it be shown, and behold, I am even as one who hath exceeded in wine drinking and who hath not spared himself; one who is afflicted with distempers and who wandereth from his right mind, being perplexed about his case and drowned in the sea of thought.\" When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard this, she broke out into excessive weeping and sobbing, and said to the Eunuch, \"Ask him if he have parted from one he loveth even as his mother or father.\" The Castrato asked as she bade him, and Zau al-Makan replied, \"Yes, I have parted from every one I loved: but the dearest of all to me was my sister, from whom Fate hath separated me.\" When Nuzhat al- Zaman heard this, she exclaimed, \"Allah Almighty reunite him with what he loveth!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat al-Zaman heard his words she said, \"Allah reunite him with what he loveth!\" Then quoth she to the Eunuch, \"Tell him to let me hear somewhat anent his separation from his countrymen and his country.\" The Eunuch did so, and Zau al-Makan sighed heavily and began repeating these couplets,[FN#317]\n\n\"Is not her love a pledge by all mankind confest? * The house\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    that hometh Hinda be forever blest'\nHer love all levels; man can reck of naught beside; * Naught or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   before or after can for man have zest\n'Tis though the vale is paved with musk and ambergris * That day\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   when Hinda's footstep on its face is prest:\nHail to the beauty of our camp, the pride of folk, * The dearling\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   who en' Slaves all hearts by her behest:\nAllah on 'Time's Delight' send large dropped clouds that teem *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   With genial rain but bear no thunder in their breast.\"\nAnd also these,\n\n\"I vow to Allah if at home I sight * My sister Nuzhat al-Zamani\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   highs\nI'll pass the days in joyance and delight * Mid bashful minions,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     maidens soft and white:\nTo sound of harps in various modes they smite * Draining the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    bowl, while eyes rain lively light\n'Neath half closed lids, a sipping lips red bright * By stream\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    bank flowing through my garden site.\"\n\nWhen he had finished his verse, Nuzhat al-Zaman lifted up a skirt of the litter curtain and looked at him. As soon as her eyes fell on his face, she knew him for certain and cried out, \"O my brother! O Zau al-Makan!\" He also looked at her and knew her and cried out, \"O my sister! O Nuzhat al-Zaman!\" Then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit. When the Eunuch saw this case, he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them, waited till they should recover. After a while they came to themselves, and Nuzhat al-Zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy: oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her, and she repeated these verses,\n\n\"Time sware my life should fare in woeful waste; * Forsworn art\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Time, expiate thy sin in haste![FN#318]\nComes weal and comes a welcome friend to aid; * To him who brings\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   good news, rise, gird thy waist\nI spurned old world tales of Eden bliss; * Till came I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Kausar[FN#319] on those lips\n\nWhen Zau al-Makan heard this, he pressed his sister to his breast; tears streamed from his eyes for excess of joy and he repeated these couplets,[FN#320]\n\n\"Long I lamented that we fell apart, * While tears repentant\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    railed from these eyne;\nAnd sware, if Time unite us twain once more, * 'Severance' shall\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    never sound from tongue of mine:\nJoy hath so overwhelmed me that excess * Of pleasure from mine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    eyes draws gouts of brine:\nTears, O mine eyes, have now become your wont * Ye weep for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    pleasure and you weep for pine!\"\n\nThey sat awhile at the litter door till she said to him, \"Come with me into the litter and tell me all that hath befallen thee, and I will tell thee what happened to me.\" So they entered and Zau al-Maken said, \"Do thou begin thy tale.\" Accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the Khan and what had happened to her with the Badawi; how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother Sharrkan and had sold her to him; how he had freed her at the time of buying; how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the King, their sire, had sent and asked for her from Sharrkan. Then quoth she, \"Praised be Allah who hath vouchsafed thee to me and ordained that, even as we left our father together, so together shall we return to him!\" And she added, \"Of a truth my brother Sharrkan gave me in marriage to this Chamberlain that he might carry me to my father. And this is what befel me from first to last; so now tell me how it hath fared with thee since I left thee.\" Thereupon he told her all that had happened to him from beginning to end; and how Allah vouchsafed to send the Fireman to him, and how he had journeyed with him and spent his money on him and had served him night and day. She praised the Stoker for this and Zau al-Makan added, \"Of a truth, O my sister, this Fireman hath dealt with me in such benevolent wise as would not lover with lass nor sire with son, for that he fasted and gave me to eat, and he walked whilst he made me ride; and I owe my life to him.\" Said she, \"Allah willing, we will requite him for all this, according to our power.\" Then she called the Eunuch, who came and kissed Zau al- Makan's hand, and she said, \"Take thy reward for glad tidings, O face of good omen! It was thy hand reunited me with my brother; so the purse I gave thee and all in it are thine. But now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me.\" The Castrato rejoiced and, going in to the Chamberlain, him to his mistress. Accordingly, he came in to his wife and finding Zau al-Makan with her, asked who he was. So she told him all that had befallen them both, first and last, and added, \"Know, O Chamberlain, that thou hast married no slave girl; far from it, thou hast taken to wife the daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman for I am Nuzhat al- Zaman, and this is my brother, Zau al-Makan.\" When the Chamberlain heard the story he knew it to be sooth, and its manifest truth appeared to him and he was certified that he was become King Omar bin al-Nu'uman's son in law, so he said to himself, \" 'Twill be my fate to be made viceroy of some province.\"[FN#321] Then he went up to Zau al-Makan and gave him joy of his safety and reunion with his sister, and bade his servants forthwith make him ready a tent and one of the best of his own horses to ride. Thereupon said Nuzhat al-Zaman, \"We are now near our country and I would be left alone with my brother, that we may enjoy each other's company and take our fill of it ere we reach Baghdad; for we have been parted a long, long time.\" \"Be it as thou biddest,\" replied the Chamberlain, and, going forth from them, sent them wax candles and various kinds of sweetmeats, together with three suits of the costliest for Zau al-Makan. Then he returned to the litter and related the good he had done and Nuzhat al-Zaman said to him, \"Bid the Eunuch bring me the Fireman and give him a horse to ride and ration him with a tray of food morning and evening, and let him be forbidden to leave us.\" The Chamberlain called the Castrato and charged him to do accordingly; so he replied, \"I hear and I obey;\" and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the Stoker till he found him in the rear of the caravan, girthing his ass and preparing for flight. The tears were running adown his cheeks, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan; and he was saying to himself, \"Indeed, I warned him for the love of Allah, but he would not listen to me; Oh would I knew what is become of him!\" Ere he had done speaking the Eunuch was standing by his head whilst the pages surrounded him The Fireman turned and seeing the Eunuch and the pages gathered around him became yellow with fear,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Stoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself, saying, \"Oh would I knew what is become of him!\"; ere he had done speaking the Castrato was standing by his head and his side muscles quivered for fear and he lifted up his voice and cried, \"Verily he knoweth not the value of the good offices I have done him! I believe he hath denounced me to the Eunuch (hence these pages et about me) and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime.\" Then the effeminated one cried at him, saying, \"Who was it recited the verses? O liar! why didst thou say, 'I never repeated these couplets, nor do I know who repeated them;' when it was thy companion? But now I will not leave thee between this place and Baghdad, and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee.\" Quoth the Fireman, \"What I feared hath befallen me.\" And he repeated this couplet,\n\n\"'Twas as I feared the coming ills discerning: * But unto Allah we are all returning.\"\n\nThen the Eunuch cried upon the pages, saying, \"Take him off the ass.\" So they carried him along with the caravan, surrounded by the pages, as the white contains the black of the eye; and the Castrato said to them, \"If a hair of him be lost, you will be lost with it.\" And he bade them privily treat him with honour and not humiliate him. But when the Stoker saw himself beset by the pages, he despaired of his life and turning to the Eunuch, said to him, \"O Chief, I am neither this youth's brother nor am I akin to him, nor is he sib to me; but I was a Fireman in a Hammam and found him cast out, in his sickness, on the dung heap.\" Then the caravan fared on and the Stoker wept and imagined in himself a thousand things, whilst the Eunuch walked by his side and told him nothing, but said to him, \"Thou disturbedst our mistress by reciting verses, thou and this youth: but fear nothing for thy self;\" and kept laughing at him the while to himself. Whenever the caravan halted, they served him with food, and he and the Castrato ate from one dish.[FN#322] Then the Eunuch bade his lads bring a gugglet of sugared sherbet and, after drinking himself, gave it to the Fireman, who drank; but all the while his tears never dried, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan and for what had befallen them in their strangerhood. So they both travelled on with the caravan, whilst the Chamberlain now rode by the door of his wife's litter, in attendance on Zau al-Makan and his sister, and now gave an eye to the Fireman; and Nuzhat al-Zaman and her brother occupied themselves with converse and mutual condolence; and they ceased not after this fashion till they came within three days' journey from Baghdad. Here they alighted at eventide and rested till the morning morrowed; and as they awoke and they were about to load the beasts, behold, there appeared afar off a great cloud of dust that darkened the firmament till it became black as gloomiest night.[FN#323] Thereupon the Chamberlain cried out to them, \"Stay, and your loading delay!\"; then, mounting with his Mamelukes, rode forward in the direction of the dust cloud. When they drew near, suddenly appeared under it a numerous conquering host like the full tide sea, with flags and standards, drums and kettledrums, horsemen and footmen. The Chamberlain marvelled at this; and when the troops saw him, there detached itself from amongst them a plump of five hundred cavaliers, who fell upon him and his suite and surrounded them, five for one; whereupon said he to them, \"What is the matter and what are these troops, that ye do this with us?\" Asked they, \"Who art thou; and whence comest thou, and whither art thou bound?\" and he answered, \"I am the Chamberlain of the Emir of Damascus, King Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and I bring tribute and presents from him to his father in Baghdad.\" When the horsemen heard his words they let their head kerchiefs fall over their faces and wept, saying, \"In very sooth King Omar is dead and he died not but of poison. So fare ye forwards; no harm shall befal you till you join his Grand Wazir, Dandan.\" Now when the Chamberlain heard this, he wept sore and exclaimed, \"Oh for our disappointment in this our journey!\" Then he and all his suite wept till they had come up with the host and sought access to the Wazir Dandan, who granted an interview and called a halt and, causing his pavilion to be pitched, sat down on a couch therein and commanded to admit the Chamberlain. Then he bade him be seated and questioned him; and he replied that he was Chamberlain to the Emir of Damascus and was bound to King Omar with presents and the tribute of Syria. The Wazir, hearing the mention of King Omar's name, wept and said, \"King Omar is dead by poison, and upon his dying the folk fell out amongst themselves as to who should succeed him, until they were like to slay one another on this account; but the notables and grandees and the four Kazis interposed and all the people agreed to refer the matter to the decision of the four judges and that none should gainsay them. So it was agreed that we go to Damascus and fetch thence the King's son, Sharrkan, and make him Sultan over his father's realm. And amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet, Zau Al-Makan, for, quoth they, his name be Light of the Place, and he hath a sister Nuzhat al-Zaman highs, the Delight of the Time; but they set out five years ago for Al-Hijaz and none wotteth what is become of them.\" When the Chamberlain heard this, he knew; that his wife had told him the truth of her adventures; and he grieved with sore grief for the death of King Omar, albeit he joyed with exceeding joy, especially at the arrival of Zau al-Makan, for that he would now become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan's Chamberlain heard of the death of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman he mourned, but he rejoiced because of his wife and her brother Zau al-Makan who would become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead. So he turned to the Wazir Dandan and said to him, \"Verily your tale is a wonder of wonders! Know, O Chief Wazir, that here, where you have encountered me, Allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions, for that His Almighty Will restoreth to you Zau al-Makan and his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman; whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can.\" When the Minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said, \"O Chamberlain, tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the cause of their long absence.\" So he repeated to him the whole story and told him that Nuzhat al-Zaman was his wife and related to him the adventures of Zau al-Makan from first to last. As soon as he had ended his tale, the Wazir sent for the Emirs and Wazirs and Chief Officers and acquainted them with the matter; whereat they rejoiced with great joy and wondered at the happy chance. Then they gathered in a body and went in to the Chamberlain and did their service to him, kissing the ground between his hands; and the Wazir Dandan also rose and went out to meet him and stood before him in honour. After this, the Chamberlain held on that day a Divan council; and he and the Wazir sat upon a throne, whilst all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State took their places before them, according to their several ranks.[FN#324] Then they melted sugar in rose water and drank, after which the Emirs sat down to hold council and permitted the rest of the host to mount and ride forward leisurely, till they should make an end of their debate and overtake them. So the officers kissed the ground between their hands and mounting, rode onwards, preceded by the standards of war. When the grandees had finished their conference, they took horse and rejoined the host; and the Chamberlain approached the Wazir Dandan and said, \"I deem it well to ride on before you, and precede you, that I may get ready a place for the Sultan and notify him of your coming and of your choosing him as Sultan over the head of his brother Sharrkan.\" \"Aright thou reckest,\" answered the Wazir Then the Chamberlain rose up in haste and Dandan also stood up to do him honour and brought him presents, which he conjured him to accept. In similar guise did all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State, bringing him gifts and calling down blessings on him and saying to him, \"Haply thou wilt mention our case to Sultan Zau al-Makan and speak to him to continue us in our dignities.\"[FN#325] The Chamberlain promised all they required and bade his pages be ready to march, whereupon the Wazir Dandan sent with him tents and bade the tent pitchers set them up at a day's journey from the city. And they did his bidding. Then the Chamberlain mounted and rode forward, full of joy and saying to himself, \"How blessed is this gurney!\", and indeed his wife was exalted in his eyes, she and her brother Zau al-Makan. They made all haste over their wayfare, till they reached a place distant a day's journey from Baghdad, where the Chamberlain called a halt for rest, and bade his men alight and make ready a sitting place for the Sultan Zau al-Makan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, while he rode forward with his Mamelukes and, alighting at a distance from Nuzhat al-Zaman's litter, commanded the eunuchs to ask leave of admission to the presence. They did so and she gave permission; whereupon he went in to her and conversed with her and her brother; and told them of the death of their father; and of Zau al-Makan, how the heads of the people had made him King over them in the stead of his sire; and he gave them joy of the kingdom. They both wept for their father and asked the manner of his being killed; but the Chamberlain answered, \"The news rests with the Wazir Dandan who will be here tomorrow leading all the host; and it only remaineth for thee, O King, to do what they counsel, since they have unanimously chosen thee Sultan; for if thou do not this, they will choose some one else and thou canst not be sure of thy life with another Sultan. Haply he will kill thee, or discord may befal between you twain and the kingdom pass out of the hands of both.\" Zau al-Makan bowed his head awhile and then said, \"I accept this position;\" for indeed there was no refusing; and he was certified that the Chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way. Then he added, \"O my uncle, how shall I do with my brother Sharrkan?\" \"O my son,\" replied the Chamberlain, \"thy brother will be Sultan of Damascus and thou Sultan of Baghdad; so take heart of grace and get ready thy case.\" Zau al-Makan accepted this and the Chamberlain presented him with a suit of royal raiment and a dagger[FN#326] of state, which the Wazir Dandan had brought with him; then leaving him he bade the tent pitchers choose a spot of rising ground and set up thereon a spacious pavilion, wherein the Sultan might sit to receive the Emirs and Grandees. Moreover he ordered the kitcheners to cook rich viands and serve them and he commanded the water carriers to dispose the water troughs. They did as he bade them and presently arose a cloud of dust from the ground and spread till it walled the horizon round. After awhile, the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of Baghdad and Khorasan, a conquering host like the full tide sea.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Chamberlain bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion spacious enough to receive the subjects flocking to their Sultan, they planted a splendid Sh\u00e1hmiy\u00e1nah[FN#327] befitting Kings. And as they ended their labours behold, a dust cloud spired aloft and the breeze made it lift and beneath it showed a conquering host; and presently it appeared that this was the army of Baghdad and Khorasan preceded by the Wazir Dandan. And in it all rejoiced at the accession of the \"Light of the Place.\" Now Zau al-Makan had donned robes of royal estate and girt himself with the sword of state: so the Chamberlain brought him a steed and he mounted surrounded by the Mamelukes and all the company from the tents on foot, to do him service, and he rode on until he came to the great pavilion, where he sat down and he laid the royal dagger across his thighs, whilst the Chamberlain stood in attendance on him and his armed slaves stationed themselves under the entrance awning of the Shahmiyanah, with drawn swords in their hands. Presently, up came the troops and the host and craved admission so the Chamberlain went in to Zau al-Makan and asked his leave whereupon he bade admit them, ten by ten. The Chamberlain acquainted them with the King's commands, to which they replied, \"We hear and we obey;\" and all drew up before the pavilion entrance. Then he took ten of them and carried them through the vestibule into the presence of Sultan Zau al-Makan, whom when they saw, they were awed; but he received them with most gracious kindness and promised them all good. So they gave him joy of his safe return and invoked Allah's blessings upon him after which they took the oath of fealty never to gainsay him in aught and they kissed ground before him and withdrew. Then other ten entered and he entreated them as he had entreated the ethers; and they ceased not to enter, ten by ten, till none was left but the Wazir Dandan. Lastly the Minister went in and kissed the ground before Zau al-Makan, who rose to meet him, saying, \"Welcome, O Wazir and sire sans peer! Verily, thine acts are those of a counsellor right dear, and judgement and foreseeing clear are in the hands of the Subtle of Lere.\" Then bade he the Chamberlain forthwith go out and cause the tables to be spread and order all the troops thereto. So they came and ate and drank. Moreover the Sultan commanded his Wazir Dandan call a ten days' halt of the army, that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain. The Wazir obeyed the commands of the Sultan with submission and wished him eternity of glory and said, \"This needs must be!\" He then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days. They did as he bade them and, moreover, he gave them leave to divert themselves and ordered that none of the lords in waiting should attend upon the King for service during the space of three days. Then the Wazir went to the Sultan and reported all to him, and Zau al-Makan waited until nightfall, when he went in to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman and asked her, \"Dost thou know the cause of my father's murder or not?\" \"I have no knowledge of the cause,\" she answered, and drew a silken curtain before herself, whilst Zau al-Makan seated himself without the curtain and commanded the Wazir to the presence and, when he came, said to him, \"I desire thou relate to me in detail the cause of the killing of my sire, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman!\" \"Know then, O King,\" replied Dandan, \"that King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, when he returned to Baghdad from his chasing and hunting and entered the city, enquired for thee and thy sister, but could not find you and knew that you twain had gone on the Pilgrimage; whereat he was greatly grieved and much angered, and his breast was straitened and he abode thus half a year, seeking news of you from all who came and went but none could give him any tidings. Now while we were in attendance upon him one day, after a whole year had sped since ye were lost to his sight, lo! there came to us an ancient dame with signs of being a devotee, accompanied by five damsels, high bosomed virgins like moons, endowed with such beauty and loveliness as tongue faileth to describe; and, to crown their perfections of comeliness, they could read the Koran and were versed in various kinds of learning and in the histories of bygone peoples. Then that old woman sought audience of the King, and he bade admit her; whereupon she entered the presence and kissed the ground between his hands. I was then sitting by his side and he, seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness, made her draw near and take seat hard by him. And when she had sat down she addressed him and said, 'Know, O King, that with me are five damsels, whose like no King among the Kings possesseth; for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection. They read the Koran\u2014and the Traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races. They stand here between thy hands to do thee service, O King of the Age, and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised. 'Thy father, who hath found mercy;[FN#328] looked at the damsels and their favour pleased him; so he said to them, Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!'\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said unto King Zau al-Makan, \"Thy father, who hath found mercy, glanced at the damsels and their favour pleased him and he said to them, 'Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!' Thereupon one of them came forward and, kissing the ground before him, spake as follows[FN#329] 'Know, O King, that it behoveth one of good breeding to eschew impertinence and adorn himself with excellencies, and observe the Divine injunctions and avoid mortal sins; and to this he should apply himself with the assiduity of one who, if he stray therefrom, falleth into perdition; for the foundation of good breeding is virtuous behaviour. And know that the chief cause and reason of man's existence is the endeavour after life everlasting, and the right way thereto is the service of Allah. Wherefore it behoveth thee to deal beneficently with the people: and swerve not from this canon, for the mightier men are in dignity, the more their need of prudence and foresight; and indeed Monarchs need this more than the many, for the general cast themselves into affairs, without taking thought to the issue thereof. Be thou prodigal of thy life and thy good in the way of Allah, and know that, if an enemy dispute with thee, thou mayst dispute with him and refute him with proofs and be proof against him; but as for thy friend, there is none can judge between thee and him save righteousness and fair dealing. Choose, therefore, thy friend for thyself, after thou hast proved him. If he be of the brotherhood of futurity,[FN#330] let him be zealous in observing the externals of the Holy Law and versed in its inner meaning, as far as may be; and if he be of the brotherhood of the world, let him be free born, sincere, neither a fool nor a perverse, for the fool man is such that even his parents might well flee from him, and a liar cannot be a true friend. Indeed the word, Sidd\u00edk[FN#331] ('friend') deriveth from Sidk ('truth') that welleth up from the bottom of the heart; and how can this be the case, when falsehood is manifest upon the tongue? And know, that the observance of the Law profiteth him who practiseth it: so love thy brother, if he be of this quality and do not cast him off, even if thou see in him that which irketh thee, for a friend is not I like a wife, whom one can divorce and re-marry: nay, his heart is like glass: once broken, it may not be mended. And Allah bless him who saith,\n\n'Ware how thou hurtest man with hurt of heart; * 'Tis hard to win\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     thee back the heart offended:\nFor hearts indeed, whence love is alien made, * Like broken glass\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     may nevermore be mended.'\n\nThe maiden continued and concluded with pointing out to us what sages say, 'The best of brethren is he who is the most constant in good counsel; the best of action is that which is fairest in its consequence, and the best of praise is not that which is in the mouths of men. It is also said, 'It behoveth not the servant to neglect thanking Allah especially for two favours, health and reason.' Again it is said, 'Whoso honoureth himself, his lust is a light matter to him, and he who maketh much of his small troubles, Allah afflicteth him with the greater; he who obeyeth his own inclination neglecteth his duties and he who listeneth to the slanderer loseth the true friend. He who thinketh well of thee, do thou fulfill his thought of thee. He who exceedeth in contention sinneth, and he who against upright standeth not on ward, is not safe from the sword. Now will I tell thee somewhat of the duties of Kazis and judges. Know, O King, that no judgement serveth the cause of justice save it be given after proof positive, and it behoveth the judge to treat all people on the same level, to the intent that the great may not hunger for oppression nor the small despair of justice. Furthermore he should extract proof from the complainant and impose an oath upon the defendant; and mediation is admissible between Moslems, except it be a compromise sanctioning the unlawful or forbidding the lawful.[FN#332] If thou shalt have done aught during the day, of which thy reason is doubtful but thy good intention is proved, thou (O Kazi) shouldst revert to the right, for to do justice is a religious obligation and to return to that which is right is better than persistence in wrong. Then (O judge) thou shouldest study precedents and the law of the case and do equal justice between the suitors, withal fixing thine eyes upon the truth and committing thine affair to Allah (be He extolled and exalted!). And require thou proof of the complainant, and if he adduce evidence let him have due benefit of it; and if not, put the defendant to his oath; for this is the ordinance of Allah. Receive thou the testimony of competent Moslem witnesses, one against other, for Almighty Allah hath commanded judges to judge by externals, He Himself taking charge of the inner and secret things. It behoveth the judge also to avoid giving judge meet, whilst suffering from stress of pain or hunger,[FN#333] and that in his decisions between folk he seek the face of Allah Almighty for he whose intent is pure and who is at peace with himself, Allah shall guarantee him against what is between him and the people.' Quoth al-Zuhri,[FN#334] 'There are three things for which, if they be found in a Kazi, he should be deposed; namely, if he honour the base, if he love praise and if he fear dismissal. And Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once deposed a Kazi, who asked him, 'Why hast thou dismissed me? It hath reached me,' answered Omar, 'that thy converse is greater than thy condition.' It is said also that Iskandar[FN#335] said to his Kazi, 'I have invested thee with this function and committed to thee in it my soul and mine honour and my manliness; so do thou guard it with thy sense and thine understanding.' To his Cook he said, 'Thou art the Sultan of my body; so look thou tender it as thine own self.' To his Secretary he said, 'Thou art the controller of my wit: so do thou watch over me in what thou writest for me and from me.'\" Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eightieth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, \"Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward and, kissing the ground seven times before the King thy father, spake as follows, 'The sage Lukm\u00e1n[FN#336] said to his son, 'There be three who are known only in three several cases; the merciful man is unknown save in time of wrath, the brave only in battle, and thy friend in time of need.' It is said that the oppressor shall be depress though by people praised, and that the oppress is at rest though by people blamed. Quoth Allah Almighty,[FN#337] 'Assuredly deem not that those who rejoice in what they have done, and who love to be praised for what they have not done, shall escape reckoning of punishment: indeed there is reserved for them a grievous penalty.' And he said[FN#338] (on whom be salvation and salutation!), 'Works are according to intention and to each man is attributed that which he intendeth.' He said also, 'In the body is a part which being sound the rest is sound, and which being unsound the whole is unsound.' And this is the heart. Now this heart is the most marvellous of what is in man, since it is that which ordereth his whole affair: If covetise stir in it, desire destroyeth him, and if affliction master it, anguish slayeth him; if anger rage in it, danger is hard upon him; if it be blest with contentment, he is safe from discontent; if fear surprise it, he is full of mourning; and if calamity overtake it, affliction betideth him. If a man gain the use of wealth, peradventure he is diverted thereby from the remembrance of his Lord; if poverty choke him his heart is distracted by woe, or if disquietude waste his heart, weakness causeth him to fall. Thus, in any case, nothing profiteth him but that he be mindful of Allah and occupy himself with gaining his livelihood in this world and securing his place in the next. It was asked of a certain sage, 'Who is the most ill conditioned of men?'; and he answered, 'The man whose lusts master his manhood and whose mind soareth over high, so that his knowledge dispreadeth and his excuse diminisheth; and how excellently saith the poet,\n\nFreest am I of all mankind fro' meddling wight * Who, seeing\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    others err, self error ne'er can sight:\nRiches and talents are but loans to creature lent, * Each wears\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    the cloak of that he bears in breast and sprite:\nIf by mistaken door attempt on aught thou make, * Thou shalt go\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    wrong and if the door be right, go right!'\n\nContinued the maiden, 'As for anecdotes of devotees, quoth Hisham bin Bashar, 'I asked Omar bin Ubayd, What is true piety?'; and he answered, 'The Apostle of Allah (to whom be salutation and salvation!) hath explained it when he sayeth, The pious is he who forgetteth not the grave nor calamity and who preferreth that which endureth to that which passeth away; who counteth not the morrow as of his days but reckoneth himself among the dead.' And it is related that Abu Zarr[FN#339] used to say, Want is dearer to me than wealth, and unheal is dearer to me than health.' Quoth one of the listeners, 'May Allah have mercy on Abu Zarr!'. For my part, I say, 'Whoso putteth his trust in the goodness of the election of Almighty Allah should be content with that condition which Allah hath chosen for him.' Quoth one of the Companions of the Prophet, 'Ibn Abi Aufa[FN#340] once prayed with us the dawn prayer. When he had done, he recited, 'O Thou Enwrapped!'[FN#341] till he came to where Allah saith, 'When there shall be a trumping on the trumpet,' and fell down dead. It is said that Sabit al-Banani wept till he well nigh lost his eyes. They brought him a man to medicine him who said to him, 'I will cure thee, provided thou obey my bidding' Asked Sabit, 'In what matter?' Quoth the leach, 'In that thou leave weeping!' 'What is the worth of mine eyes?', rejoined Sabit, 'if they do not weep?' Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, 'Exhort thou me!'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-first Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, \"Thus spake the second hand maid to the King who hath found mercy, Omar bin al-Nu'uman. 'Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, Exhort thou me!' 'I exhort thee,' replied he, 'to be a self ruler, an abstainer in this world, and in the next a greedy slave.' 'How so?' asked the other and Mohammed answered, 'The abstinent man in this world conquereth both the world that is and the world to come.' And quoth Ghaus bin Abdillah, 'There were two brothers among the sons of Israel, one of whom said to the other, 'What be the most perilous[FN#342] thing thou hast done?' Replied the brother, 'I once came upon a nest of young birds; so I took out one and threw it back into the nest; but among the chickens were some which drew apart from it. This is the most perilous thing I ever did; now what be the most perilous thing thou hast ever done?' He rejoined, 'When I arise for prayer I am fearful that it is only for the sake of the reward.' Now their father heard these words and exclaimed, 'O Allah, an say they sooth take them to Thyself!' It was declared by one of the wise men, 'Verily, these were of the most virtuous of children.' Quoth Sa'\u00edd bin Jubayr,[FN#343] 'I was once in company with Fuzalah bin 'Ubaydand said to him, 'Exhort thou me!, Replied he, 'Bear in mind these two necessaries, Shun syntheism[FN#344] and harm not any of Allah's creatures.' And he repeated these two couplets,\n\n'Be as thou wilt, for Allah still is bounteous Lord, * And care\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    dispeller dread not therefore bane and ban\nTo two things only never draw thee nigh, nor give * Partner to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Allah trouble to thy brother man.'\nAnd how well saith the poet,\n\n'An thou of pious works a store neglect * And after death meet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     one who did collect,\nThou shalt repent thou diddest not as he, * Nor madest ready as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     he did elect.'\n\nThen the third damsel came forward, after the second had with drawn, and said, 'Of a truth, the chapter of piety is exceeding wide; but I will mention what occurreth to me thereof, concerning the pious of old. Quoth a certain holy man, 'I congratulate myself in death, though I am not assured of rest therein, save that I know death interveneth between a man and his works; so I hope for the doubling of good works and the docking off of ill works.' And Ita'a al Salami, when he had made an end of an exhortation, was wont to tremble and grieve and weep sore; and as they asked him why he did this he answered, 'I desire to enter upon a grave matter, and it is the standing up before Almighty Allah to do in accordance with my exhortation.' In similar guise Zayn al-Abid\u00edn,[FN#345] son of Al-Husayn, was wont to tremble when he rose to pray. Being asked the cause of this, he replied, 'Know ye not before whom I stand and whom I address?' It is said that there lived near Sufy\u00e1n al-Thauri[FN#346] a blind man who, when the month of Ramazan came, went out with the folk to pray,[FN#347] but remained silent and hung back. Said Sufyan, 'On the Day of Resurrection he shall come with the people of the Koran and they will be distinguished by increase of honour from their fellows.' Quoth Sufyan, 'Were the soul established in the heart as befitteth, it would fly away for joy and pining for Paradise, and for grief and fear of hell-fire.' It is related also of Sufyan Al-Thauri that he said, 'To look upon the face of a tyrant is a sin.' Then the third damsel retired and came for ward the fourth, who said, 'Here am I to treat of sundry traditions of pious men which suggest themselves to me. It is related that Bishr Barefoot[FN#348] said, 'I once heard Kh\u00e1lid say, 'Beware of secret polytheism.' I asked, 'What may secret polytheism be?'; and he answered, 'When one of you in praying prolong his inclinations and prostrations till a cause of impurity[FN#349] come upon him.' And one of the sages said, 'Doing works of weal expiateth what is ill.' Quoth Ibrahim,[FN#350] 'I supplicated Bishr Barefoot to acquaint me with some theological mysteries; but he said, 'O my son, this knowledge it behoveth us not to teach to every one; of every hundred five, even as the legal alms upon money.' Said Ibrahim, 'I thought his reply excellent and approved of it and while I was praying behold, Bishr was also praying: so I stood behind him[FN#351] making the prayer bow till the Mu'ezzin called his call. Then rose a man of tattered appearance and said, O folk, beware of a truth which bringeth unweal, for there is no harm in a lie bringing weal,[FN#352] and in time of need no choice we heed: speech booteth not in the absence of good qualities even as silence hurteth not in the presence of good. Presently I saw Bishr drop a danik,[FN#353] so I picked it up and exchanged it for a dirham which I gave him. Quoth he, 'I will not take it.' Quoth I, 'It is perfectly lawful change'; but he rejoined 'I cannot take in exchange the riches of the present world for those of the future world.' It is related also that Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal\"[FN#354]\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to bespeak Zau al-Makan on this wise, \"And quoth the maiden to thy father, 'Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal and said to him, 'O Imam of the Faith, we are a family that spin thread by night and work for our living by day; and oftentimes the cressets of the watch of Baghdad pass by and we on the roof spinning by their light. Is this forbidden to us?' Asked Ahmad:'Who are thou?' 'I am the sister of Bishr Barefoot,' answered she. Rejoined the Iman, 'O household of Bishr, I shall never cease to drink full draughts of piety from your hearts.' Quoth one of the sages, 'When Allah willeth well to His servant He openeth upon him the gate of action.' M\u00e1lik bin Din\u00e1r,[FN#355] when he passed through the bazar and saw aught he desired, was wont to say, 'O soul, take patience, for I will not accord to thee what thou desirest.' He said also (Allah accept him!), 'The salvation of the soul lies in resistance to it and its damnation in submission to it.' Quoth Mans\u00far bin Amm\u00e1r,[FN#356] 'I made a pilgrimage and was faring Meccahwards by way of Cufa, and the night was overcast, when I heard a voice crying out from the deeps of the darkness saying, 'O Allah, I swear by Thy Greatness and Thy Glory, I meant not through my disobedience to transgress against Thee; for indeed I am not ignorant of Thee; but my fault is one Thou didst foreordain to me from eternity without beginning;[FN#357] so do Thou pardon my transgression, for indeed I disobeyed Thee of my ignorance!' When he had made an end of his prayer he recited aloud the verse, 'O true believers, save your souls and those of your families from the fire whose fuel is men and stones.'[FN#358] Then I heard a fall, but not knowing what it was I passed on. When the morning morrowed, as we went our way, behold, we fell in with a funeral train, followed by an old woman whose strength had left her. I asked her of the dead, and she answered, 'This is the funeral of a man who passed by us yesterday whilst my son was standing at prayer and after his prayers he recited a verse from the Book of Allah Almighty when the man's gall bladder burst and he fell dead.' Therewith the fourth damsel retired and the fifth came forward and said, 'I here will also repeat what occurreth to me regarding the acts of devotees in olden time. Maslamah bin Din\u00e1r used to say, 'By making sound the secret thoughts, sins great and small are covered'; and, 'when the servant of Allah is resolved to leave sinning, victory cometh to him.' Also quoth he, 'Every worldly good which doth not draw one nearer to Allah is a calamity, for a little of this world distracteth from a mickle of the world to come and a mickle of the present maketh thee forget the whole of the future.' It was asked of Ab\u00fa H\u00e1zim,[FN#359] 'Who is the most prosperous of men?'; and he answered, 'Whoso spendeth his life in submission to Allah.' The other enquired, 'And who is the most foolish of mankind?' 'Whoso selleth his future for the worldly goods of others,' replied Abu Hazim. It is reported of Moses[FN#360] (on whom be peace!) that when he came to the waters of Midian he exclaimed, 'O Lord, verily I stand in need of the good which thou shalt send down to me.'[FN#361] And he asked of his Lord and not of his folk. There came two damsels and he drew water for them both and allowed not the shepherds to draw first. When the twain returned, they informed their father Shu'ayb (on whom be peace!) who said, 'Haply, he is hungry,' adding to one of them, 'Go back to him and bid him hither.' Now when she came to Moses, she veiled her face and said, 'My father biddeth thee to him that he may pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for us.' Moses was averse to this and was not willing to follow her. Now she was a woman large in the back parts, and the wind blowing upon her garment[FN#362] covered the hinder cheeks to Moses; which when Moses saw, he lowered his eyes and said to her, 'Get thee behind while I walk in front.' So she followed him till he entered the house of Shu'ayb where supper was ready.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, \"Now, quoth the fifth damsel to thy sire, 'When Moses (on whom be peace!) entered the home of Shu'ayb where supper was ready, Shu'ayb said to him, 'O Moses, I desire to pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for these two.' But Moses answered, 'I am of a household which selleth nothing of the fashion of the next world[FN#363] for what is on earth of gold and silver.' Then quoth Shu'ayb, 'O youth! nevertheless thou art my guest, and it is my wont and that of my forbears to honour the guest by setting food before him.' So Moses sat down and ate. Then Shu'ayb hired Moses for eight pilgrimages, that is to say, eight years, and made his wage marriage with one of his two daughters, and Moses' service to him was to stand for her dowry. As saith the Holy Writ of him, 'Verily I will give thee one of these my two daughters in marriage, on condition that thou serve me for hire eight pilgrimages: and if thou fulfil ten years, it is in thine own breast; for I seek not to impose a hardship on thee.'[FN#364] A certain man once said to one of his friends whom he had not met for many days, 'Thou hast made me desolate, for that I have not seen thee this long while.' Quoth the other, 'I have been distracted from thee by Ibn Shih\u00e1b: dost thou know him?' Quoth his friend, 'Yes, he hath been my neighbour these thirty years, but I have never spoken to him.' He replied, 'Verily thou forgettest Allah in forgetting\u2014thy neighbour! If thou lovedst Allah thou wouldst love thy neighbour. Knowest thou not that a neighbour hath a claim upon his neighbour,[FN#365] even as the right of kith and kin?' Said Huzayfah, 'We entered Meccah with Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm bin Adham, and Shak\u00edk al-Balkh\u00ed was also making a pilgrimage that year. Now we met whilst circumambulating the Ka'abah and Ibrahim said to Shakik, 'What is your fashion in your country?' Replied Shakik, 'When we are blest with our daily bread we eat, and when we hunger we take patience.' 'This wise,' said Ibrahim, 'do the dogs of Balkh; but we, when blest with plenty, do honour to Allah and when an hungered we thank Him.' And Shakik seated himself before Ibrahim and said to him, 'Thou art my master.' Also said Mohammed bin Imr\u00e1n, 'A man once asked of H\u00e1tim the Deaf[FN#366] 'What maketh thee to trust in Allah?' 'Two things,' answered he, 'I know that none save myself shall eat my daily bread, so my heart is at rest as to that; and I know that I was not created without the knowledge of Allah, and am abashed before Him.' Then the fifth damsel retired and the ancient dame came forward and, kissing the ground before thy father nine times, said, 'Thou hast heard, O King, what these all have spoken on the subject of piety; and I will follow their example in relating what hath reached me of the famous men of past times. It is said that the Imam al-Sh\u00e1fi'\u00ed departed the night into three portions, the first for study, the second for sleep and the third for prayer. The Imam Ab\u00fa Han\u00edfah[FN#367] was wont also to pass half the night in prayer. One\n\nday a man pointed him out to another, as he walked by and remarked, 'Yonder man watcheth the whole night.' When he heard this Abu Hanifah said, 'I was abashed before Allah to hear myself praised for what was not in me'; so after this he used to watch the whole night. And one of the Sages hath said,\n\n'Who seeketh for pearl in the Deep dives deep; * Who on high would hie robs his night of sleep.'\n\nAl-Rab\u00ed a relates that Al-Shafi'i used to recite the whole Koran seventy times during the month of Ramazan, and that in his daily prayers. Quoth Al-Shafi'i (Allah accept him!), 'During ten years I never ate my fill of barley bread, for fullness hardeneth the heart and deadeneth the wit and induceth sleep and enfeebleth one from standing up to pray.'[FN#368] It is reported of Abdullah bin Mohammed al-Sakr\u00e1 that he said, 'I was once talking with Omar and he observed to me, 'Never saw I a more God fearing or eloquent man than Mohammed bin Idris al-Shafi'i.' It so happened I went out one day with Al-H\u00e1ris bin Lab\u00edb al-Saff\u00e1r, who was a disciple of Al-Muzani[FN#369] and had a fine voice and he read the saying of the Almighty, 'This shall be a day whereon they shall not speak to any purpose, nor shall they be permitted to excuse themselves.'[FN#370] I saw Al-Shafi'i's colour change; his skin shuddered with horripilation, he was violently moved and he fell down in a fainting fit When he revived he said, 'I take refuge with Allah from the stead of the liars and the lot of the negligent! O Allah, before whom the hearts of the wise abase themselves, O Allah, of Thy bene ficence accord to me the remission of my sins, adorn me with the curtain of Thy protection and pardon me my shortcomings, by the magnanimity of Thy Being!' Then I rose and went away. Quoth one of the pious, 'When I entered Baghdad, Al-Shafi'i was there. So I sat down on the river bank to make the ablution before prayer; and behold, there passed me one who said, 'O youth, make thy Wuzu-ablution well and Allah will make it well for thee in this world and in the next.' I turned and lo! there was a man behind whom came a company of people. So I hastened to finish my ablution and followed him. Presently, he turned and asked me, 'Say, dost thou want aught?' 'Yes,' answered I, 'I desire that thou teach me somewhat of that which Allah Almighty hath taught thee.' He said, 'Know then that whoso believeth in Allah shall be saved, and whoso jealously loveth his faith shall be delivered from destruction, and whoso practiseth abstinence in this world, his eyes shall be solaced on the morrow of death. Shall I tell thee any more?' I replied, 'Assuredly;' and he continued, 'Be thou of the world that is, heedless; and of the world to come, greediest. Be truthful in all thy dealings, and thou shalt be saved with the Salvationists.' Then he went on and I asked about him and was told that he was the Imam Al-Shafi'i. Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, 'I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine, on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, \"The old woman bespake thy sire, saying, 'The Imam Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.' He also said, 'I never disputed with any one, but I would that Almighty Allah should give him the knowledge of the Truth and aid him to dispread it: nor did I ever dispute with anyone at all but for the showing forth of the Truth, and I reck not whether Allah manifest it by my tongue or by His.' He said also (whom Allah accept!), 'If thou fear to grow conceited of thy lore, then bethink thee Whose grace thou seekest and for what good thou yearnest and what punishment thou dreadest.' It was told to Abu Han\u00edfah that the Commander of the Faithful, Ab\u00fa Ja'afar al-Mans\u00far, had appointed him Kazi and ordered him a salary of ten thousand dirhams; but he would not accept of this; and, when the day came on which the money was to be paid him, he prayed the dawn prayer, then covered his head with his robe\u2014and spoke not. When the Caliph's messenger came with the money, he went in to the Imam and accosted him, but he would not speak to him. So the messenger said, 'Verily this money is lawfully thine.' 'I know that it is lawfully mine,' replied he: 'but I abhor that the love of tyrants get a hold upon my heart.'[FN#371] Asked the other, 'If thou go in to them canst thou not guard thyself from loving them?' Answered Abu Hanifah, 'Can I look to enter the sea without my clothes being wet?' Another of Al-Shafi'i's sayings (Allah accept him!) is,\n\n'Oh soul of me, an thou accept my rede, * Thou shalt be wealthy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   and of grace entire:\nCast off ambitious hopes and vain desires, * How many a death was\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    done by vain desire!'\n\nAmong the sayings of Sufy\u00e1n al-Thaur\u00ed, with which he admonished Ali bin al-Hasan al-Salami was, 'Be thou a man of truth and 'ware lies and treachery and hypocrisy and pride. Be not indebted save to Him who is merciful to His debtors; and let thine associate be one who shall dissociate thee from the world. Be ever mindful of death and be constant in craving pardon of Allah and in beseeching of Allah peace for what remaineth of thy life. Counsel every True Believer, when he asketh thee concerning the things of his faith; and beware of betraying a Believer, for whoso betrayeth a Believer, betrayeth Allah and His Apostle. Avoid dissensions and litigation; and leave that which causeth doubt in thee for things which breed no doubt:[FN#372] so shalt thou be at peace. Enjoin beneficence and forbid malevolence: so shalt thou be loved of Allah. Adorn thine inner man and Allah shall adorn thine outer man. Accept the excuse of him who excuseth self to thee and hate not any one of the Moslems. Draw near unto those who withdraw from thee and excuse those that misuse thee: so shalt thou be the friend of the Prophets. Let thine affairs, both public and private, be in Allah's charge, and fear Him with the fear of one who knoweth he is dead and who fareth towards Resurrection and Judgement stead between the hands of the Lord of Dread; and remember that to one of two houses thou art sped, either for Heavens eterne or to the Hell fires that burn.' Thereupon the old woman sat down beside the damsels. Now when thy father, who hath found mercy, heard their discourse, he knew that they were the most accomplished of the people of their time; and, seeing their beauty and loveliness and the extent of their wisdom and lore, he showed them all favour. Moreover, he turned to the ancient dame and treated her with honour, and set apart for her and her damsels the palace which had lodged Princess Abrizah, daughter of the King of Greece, to which he bade carry all the luxuries they needed. They abode with him ten days and the old woman abode with them; and, whenever the King visited them, he found her absorbed in prayer, watching by night and fasting by day; whereby love of her took hold upon his heart and he said to me, 'O Wazir, verily this old woman is of the pious, and awe of her is strong in my heart.' Now on the eleventh day, the King visited her, that he might pay her the price of the damsels; but she said to him, 'O King, know that the price of these maidens surpasseth the competence of men; indeed I seek not for them either gold or silver or jewels, be it little or much.' Now when thy father heard these words he wondered and asked her, 'O my lady and what is their price?'; whereto she answered, 'I will not sill them to thee save on condition that thou fast, watching by night a whole month, and abstaining by day, all for the love of Allah Almighty; and, if thou do this, they are thy property to use in thy palace as thou please.' So the King wondered at the perfection of her rectitude and piety and abnegation; she was magnified in his eyes and he said, 'Allah make this pious woman to profit us!' Then he agreed with her to fast for a month as she had stipulated, and she said to him, 'I will help thee with the prayers I pray for thee and now bring me a gugglet of water.' They brought one and she took it and recited over it and muttered spells, and sat for an hour speaking in speech no one understood or knew aught thereof. Lastly she covered it with a cloth and, sealing it with her signet ring, gave it to thy sire, saying, 'When thou hast fasted the first ten days, break thy fast on the eleventh night with what is in this gugglet, for it will root out the love of the world from thy heart and fill it with light and faith. As for me, tomorrow I will go forth to my brethren, the Invisible[FN#373] Controuls, for I yearn after them, and I will return to thee when the first ten days are past. Thy father took the gugglet and arose and set it apart in a closet of his palace, then locked the door and put the key in his pocket. Next day the King fasted and the old woman went her ways.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan thus continued to Zau al-Makan, \"Now when came the day for the Sultan's fast, the old woman went her ways. And after he had accomplished the ten days thereof, on the eleventh he opened the gugglet and drank what was therein and found it cordial to his stomach. Within the second ten days of the month the old woman returned, bringing sweetmeats wrapped in a green leaf, like no leaf of known tree. She went in to thy sire and saluted him; and, when he saw her, he rose to her saying, 'Welcome, O pious lady!' 'O King,' quoth she, 'the Invisible Controuls salute thee, for I told them of thee, and they rejoiced in thee and have sent thee their Halw\u00e1,[FN#374] which is of the sweetmeats of the other world. Do thou break thy fast on it at the end of the day.' The King rejoiced at this with great joy, and exclaimed, 'Praised be Allah, who hath given me brethren of the Invisible World!' Thereupon he thanked the ancient dame and kissed her hands; and he honoured her and the damsels with exceeding honour. She went forth for the twenty days of thy father's fast at the end of which time she came to him and said, 'Know, O King, that I told the Invisible Controuls of the love which is between me and thee, and informed them how I had left the maidens with thee, and they were glad that the damsels should belong to a King like thee; for they were wont, when they saw them, to be strenuous in offering on their behalf prayers and petitions ever granted. So I would fain carry them to the Invisible Controuls that they may benefit by the breath of their favour, and peradventure, they shall not return to thee without some treasure of the treasures of the earth, that thou, after completing thy fast, mayst occupy thyself with their raiment and help thyself by the money they shall bring thee, to the extent of thy desires.' When thy sire heard her words, he thanked her for them and said, 'Except that I fear to cross thee, I would not accept the treasure or aught else; but when wilt thou set out with them?' Replied she, 'On the seven and twentieth night; and I will bring them back to thee at the head of the month, by which time thou wilt have accomplished thy fast and they will have had their courses and be free from impurity; and they shall become thine and be at thy disposal. By Allah, each damsel of them is worth many times thy kingdom!' He said, 'I know it, O pious lady!' Then quoth the old woman, 'There is no help but that thou send with them someone in thy palace who is dear to thee, that she may find solace and seek a blessing of the Invisible Controuls.' Quoth he, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blessed with two children, a girl and a boy; but they were lost; years ago. Take her with thee that she may get the blessing'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, \"Quoth thy sire to the ancient woman when she demanded the handmaids of him, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blest with two children, a girl and a boy, but they were lost years ago; so take her with thee, haply she may get the benediction and, belike, the Invisible Controuls will sue Allah for her that her two children may be restored to her.' 'Thou hast said well,' replied she; 'for that indeed was her grievousest want.' Thy sire gave not over finishing his fast till the old woman said to him, 'O my son, I am going to the Invisible Controuls; so bring me Sophia.' Accordingly, he summoned her and she came forthright, and he delivered her to the old woman who mixed her up with the other damsels. Then she went in to her chamber and bringing out a sealed cup, presented it to the Sultan saying, 'On the thirtieth day, do thou repair to the Hammam and when thou comest out, enter one of the closets in thy palace and drink what is in this cup. Then sleep, and thou shalt attain what thou seekest, and peace be with thee'! Thereat the King was glad and thanked her and kissed her hands. Quoth she, 'I commend thee to Allah's care;' whereat quoth he, 'And when shall I see thee again, O pious lady? In very sooth I love not to part with thee.' Then she called down blessings on him and departed with the five damsels and the Queen; whilst the King fasted after her departure other three days, till the month ended, when he arose and went to the Hammam and coming out shut himself up in a closet of his palace, commanding that none should go in to him. There, after making fast the door, he drank what was in the cup and lay down to sleep; and we sat awaiting him till the end of the day, but he did not come out and we said, 'Perchance he is tired with the bath and with watching by night and fasting by day; wherefore he sleepeth.' So we waited till next day; but still he did not come forth. Then we stood at the closet door and cried aloud so haply he might awake and ask what was the matter. But nothing came of that; so at last we lifted up the door;[FN#375] and, going in, found him dead, with his flesh torn into strips and bits and his bones broken.[FN#376] When we saw him in this condition it was grievous to us, and we took up the cup and found within its cover a piece of paper whereon was inscribed, 'Whoso doeth evil leaveth no regrets, and this be the reward of him who playeth traitor with the daughters of Kings and who debaucheth them; and we make known to all who fall upon this scroll that Sharrkan, when he came to our country, seduced our Queen Abrizah; nor did that suffice him but he must needs take her from us and bring her to you. Then he[FN#377] sent her away in company of a black slave who slew her, and we found her lying dead on the desert sward and thrown out to wild beasts. This be no kingly deed, and he who did this is requited with naught but what he merited. So do ye suspect none of having killed him, for no one slew him but the cunning witch, whose name is Zat al-Dawahi. And behold, I have taken the King's wife, Sophia, and have carried her to her father, Afridun King of Constantinople. Moreover, there is no help for it but that we wage war upon you and kill you and take your country from you, and ye shall be cut off even to the last man, nor shall a living soul be spared by Death nor one who bloweth fire with his breath, save he who Cross and Belt[FN#378] worshippeth.' When we read this paper, we knew that the ancient woman had beguiled us and carried out her plot against us: whereupon we cried aloud and buffeted our faces and wept sore when weeping availed us naught. And the troops fell out as to whom they should make Sultan; some would have thee, and others would have thy brother Sharrkan; and we ceased not to dispute about this for the space of a month, at the end of which certain of us drew together and agreed to repair to thy brother Sharrkan: so we set out and journeyed on till we fell in with thee. And such is the manner of the death of Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman!\" Now when the Wazir Dandan had made an end of his story, Zau al- Makan and his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman wept; and the Chamberlain, who wept also, said to Zau al-Makan, \"O King, weeping will avail thee naught; nor shall aught profit thee but that thou harden thy heart and strengthen thy stress and establish thy sovranty; for verily whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead.\" Thereupon Zau al-Makan gave over his weeping and caused his throne to be set up without the pavilion, and then commanded the army to pass in review order before him. And the Chamberlain sat by his side and all the armour-bearers[FN#379] behind him, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the rest of the Emirs and Grandees stood each in his individual stead. Then quoth King Zau al-Makan to the Minister Dandan, \"Inform me concerning my sire's treasures;\" and he replied, \"I hear and I obey;\" and gave him to know of the late King's hoards and monies, and what was in the treasury of amassed wealth and jewels, and acquainted him with other precious things. So Zau al-Makan opened his hand to the army, and gave a sumptuous robe of honour to the Wazir Dandan, saying, \"Thou continues\" in office. Whereupon Dandan kissed the ground before him and wished him long life. Then he bestowed dresses on the Emirs, after which he said to the Chamberlain, \"Bring out before me the tribute of Damascus that is with thee.\" So he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, when he took them and parted them all amongst the troops,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Zau al- Makan ordered the Chamberlain to bring out before him what he had brought of the tribute of Damascus; and, when he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, he took them and parted them all amongst the troops, till nothing was left. And the Emirs kissed the ground before him and wished him long life, saying, \"Never saw we a King, who gave the like of these gifts.\" Then all went away to their tents and when it was morning he gave orders for marching. So they marched for three days, till, on the fourth day, they drew near to Baghdad. When they entered the city, they found it decorated, and Zau al-Makan, the Sultan, went up to his father's palace and sat down on the throne, whilst the Emirs of the army and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain of Damascus stood between his hands. Then he bade his private secretary write a writ to his brother Sharrkan, acquainting him with all that had passed, from first to last, and he concluded, \"As soon as thou hast read this letter, make ready thine affair and join us with thine army, that we may turn to Holy War upon the Infidels and take man bote for our father and wipe out the stain upon our honour.\" Then he folded the letter and sealed it with his seal ring and said to the Minister Dandan, \"None shall carry this letter but thou; and it behoveth thee speak my brother fair and say to him, 'If thou have a mind to thy father's kingdom, it is thine, and thy brother shall be Viceroy for thee in Damascus; for to this effect am I instructed by him.'\" So the Wazir went down from before him and made ready for his march. Then Zau al-Makan bade set apart a magnificent house for the Fireman and furnished it with the best of furniture and long is the tale of that Fireman.[FN#380] Presently Zau al-Makan went out chasing and hunting and, as he was returning to Baghdad, one of the Emirs presented him with blood horses and with beauteous handmaids whose description the tongue evades. One of the damsels pleased him: so he went in unto her and knew her that night, and she conceived by him forthright. After a while, the Wazir Dandan returned from his journey, bringing him news of his brother Sharrkan and that he was then on his way to him, and said, \"It were fitting thou go forth to meet him.\" Zau al- Makan replied, \"I hear and I consent;\" and riding forth with his Grandees a day's journey from Baghdad, he pitched his pavilions there awaiting his brother. Next morning appeared King Sharrkan amid the army of Syria, a horseman of might, a lion fierce in fight, a prow and doughty knight. As the squadrons drew nigh and the dust clouds came hard by and the troops rode up with banners on high, Zau al-Makan and those with him pushed forward to meet Sharrkan and his men; and when Zau al-Makan saw his brother, he desired to dismount, but Sharrkan conjured him not to do on this wise, and himself footed it, and walked a few paces towards him.[FN#381] As soon as he reached Zau al-Makan, the new Sultan threw himself upon him, and Sharrkan embraced him and wept with great weeping and the twain condoled with each other. Then they mounted and rode onward, they and their troops, till they reached Baghdad, where they alighted and went up to the royal palace and there they passed that night, and when next morning came, Zau al- Makan went forth and bade summon the troops from all parts, and proclaimed a Holy War and a Razzia.[FN#382] They then awaited the coming of the levies from each quarter of the kingdom, and every one who came they entreated with honour and promised him all manner of good; till in so doing a full month had sped, and the fighting men flocked to them in a continuous body. Then Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, \"O my brother, tell me thy history.\" So he told him all that had befallen him from first to last, including the benevolent dealing of the Fireman with him. Asked Sharrkan, 'Hast thou requited his kindness?\"; and he answered, \"O my brother! I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan asked his brother Zau al-Makan, \"Hast thou requited the Fireman for his kindness?\"; and he answered, \"O my brother, I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid and find time so to do.\" Therewith Sharrkan was certified that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had told him the whole truth; but he concealed what had passed between them and offered his salutation to her by her husband the Chamberlain. She sent him back her greeting, calling down blessings on him and enquiring after her daughter Kuzia-Fakan, to which he replied that the maiden was well and in the best of health and safety. Where upon she praised Almighty Allah and gave him thanks. Then Sharrkan went to his brother to take counsel with him for departure; and Zau al-Makan said, \"O my brother, as soon as the army is complete and the Arabs have come in from all parts, we will march forth.\" So he bade make ready the commissariat and prepare munitions of war and went in to his wife, who was now five months gone with child; and he put under her astrologers and mathematicians, to whom he appointed stipends and allowances. Then he set out three months after the arrival of the army of Syria, and as soon as the Arabs were come in and the troops were assembled from all directions; and, as he fared forth, he was followed by the warriors and the united host. Now the name of the General of the Daylam army was Rustam and that of the General of the army of the Turks[FN#383] Bahram. And Zau al- Makan marched in mid host and on his right was his brother Sharrkan, and on his left the Chamberlain his brother-in-law. So the squadrons broke up and pushed forward and the battalions and companies filed past in battle array, till the whole army was in motion. They ceased not to fare on for the space of a month, and each body dismounted at its own ground and there rested every week three days (for the host was great); and they advanced in this order till they came to the country of the Greeks. Then the people of the villages and hamlets and the poorer sort took fright at them and fled to Constantinople. But when King Afridun heard the tidings he arose and betook himself to Zat al-Dawahi, the same who had contrived the stratagem, and had travelled to Baghdad and had slain King Omar bin Al-Nu'uman; and who after carrying off her slaves and Queen Sophia, had returned with them all to her native land. Now when she had been restored to her son, the King of Greece, and felt herself safe, she said to King Hardub, \"Cool thine eyes; for I have avenged by blood the shame of thy daughter Abrizah, and have killed Omar bin al-Nu'uman and have brought back Sophia. So now let us go to the King of Constantinople and carry to him his daughter and acquaint him with what hath happened, that all of us be on guard and prepare our forces; and I will fare with thee to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, for I opine that the Moslems will not await our attack.\" Said Hardub, \"Tarry thou till they draw near our country, that we may make us ready meantime and assemble our power.\" Accordingly they took to levying their forces and preparing for war, and, when the news of the Moslems' advance reached them, they were prepared for defence; and Zat al Dawahi had preceded them. Now when she and her son arrived at Constantinople, the King of Kings, Afridun, hearing of the approach of Hardub, King of the Greeks, came forth to meet him and asked how it was with him and the cause of his visit. So Hardub acquainted him with the cunning doings of his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, how she had slain the Moslem King and recovered from him Queen Sophia, and had said, \"The Moslems have assembled their forces and are on their way to attack us, wherefore it behoveth that we two join hands in single band and meet them.\" Now King Afridun rejoiced in the return of his daughter and the killing of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; and he sent to all countries seeking succour and acquainting the folk with the cause of slaying the Moslem King. So the Nazarene troops flocked to him and three months were not past ere the army of the Greeks was complete, besides which there joined themselves to him Franks from all their lands, French, Germans[FN#384] and Ragusans,[FN#385] with men of Zara,[FN#386] Venetians, Genoese, and all the hosts of the Yellow Faces[FN#387]; and, when the gathering was at its full, earth was straitened on them by reason of their multitude. Then Afridun, the Great King, ordered a march; so they set out and ceased not to defile through the city for ten days. They fared on till they reached the Wady highs Al-Nu'uman, a broad sided vale hard by the Salt Sea, where they halted three days; and on the fourth they were about to set out again, when news came that the army of Al-Islam on them press, and the defenders of the faith of Mohammed, of Men the Best. So they halted in it other three days, and on the eighth they espied a dust cloud which towered till it walled the whole land; nor was an hour of the day past ere that dust began to drift and was torn to shreds in the lift, and pierced through its shades the starry radiance of lance and the white levee of blades. Presently there appeared beneath it the banners Islamitan and the ensigns Mahometan; the horsemen urged forward, like the letting loose of seas that surged, clad in mail, as they were mackerel-back clouds which the moon enveil; whereupon the two hosts clashed, like two torrents on each other dashed. Eyes fell upon eyes; and the first to seek combat singular was the Wazir Dandan, he and the army of Syria, numbering thirty thousand bridles, and with him were the General of the Turks, and the General of Daylam, Rustam and Bahram, amid twenty thousand horse, behind whom came the men from the shores of the Salt Sea, clad in iron mail, as they were full moons that past through a night o'ercast. Then the Nazarene host called out on Jesus and Mary, and the defiled[FN#388] Cross and they heaped themselves upon the Wazir Dandan and those with him of the Syrian host. Now all this was in pursuance of a stratagem devised by that ancient woman Zat al-Dawahi; for, before his departure, King Afridun had gone in to her and asked her, \"How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue?; it is thou hast caused this great distress to us;\" and she had answered, \"O great King and mighty Cohen![FN#389] I will teach thee a trick would baffle Iblis himself, though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, all this was a stratagem of the ancient woman, for that the King before his departure had gone to her and asked, \"How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue? it is thou hast caused this great distress to us!\" And she had answered, \"O great King and mighty Cohen, I will teach thee a trick would baffle the Devil himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts. It is that thou send fifty thousand men going down in ships, and sailing over the sea to the Mountain of Smoke; and there let them land and stir not till {he standards of Al-Islam come upon thee, when do thou up and at them. Then bid the troops from the seaward sally out upon the Moslems and take them in rear, whilst we confront them from the landward. So not one of them shall escape, and our sorrows shall tease and peace abide with us.\" Now the counsel of this ancient woman commended itself to King Afridun, and he replied, \"Right is the recking thou reckest, O Princess of wits and recourse of Kings and Cohens warring for their blood wit!\" So when the army of Al-Islam came upon them in chat valley, before they knew of it the flames began to burn up the tents and the swords in men's bodies to make rents. Then hurried up the army of Baghdad and Khorasan who numbered one hundred and twenty thousand horse, with Zau al-Makan in the front of war. When the host of the Infidels that lay by the sea saw them, they sallied out against them and followed in their tracks; and when Zau al- Makan espied this he cried out to his men, \"Turn back to the Infidels, O People of the Chosen Apostle, and slay those who deny and hate the authority of the Compassionating, the Compassionate!\" So they turned and fought with the Christians. Then Sharrkan marched up with another corps of the Moslem host, some hundred thousand men, whilst the Infidels numbered nigh upon a thousand and six hundred thousand men. When the Moslems were united, their hearts were strengthened and they cried out, saying, \"Verily Allah hath pro mised us victory, and to the Infidels hath assigned defeat.\" And they clashed together with sword and spear. Now Sharrkan tare through rank and row and raged among the masses of the foe, fighting so fierce a fight as to make children grey grow; nor did he cease tourneying among the infidel horde and working havoc among them with the keen edged sword, shouting \"Allaho Akbar!\" (Allah is Most Great) till he drove back the host to the coast. Then failed the force of the foe and Allah gave victory to the faith of Al-Islam, and folk fought folk, drunken without strong drink till they slew of the Infidels in this affair forty and five thousand, while of the Moslems but three thousand and five hundred fell. Moreover, the Lion of the Faith, King Sharrkan, and his brother, Zau al-Makan, slept not that night, but occupied themselves with congratulating their braves and with looking to the wounded and with assuring the army of victory and salvation and promise of reward in the world to come. Thus far concerning the Moslem; but as regards King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople and Sovran of Roum, and Zat Al-Dawahi, they assembled the Emirs of the host and said to them, \"Verily, we had worked our will and solaced our hearts, but our over confidence in our numbers, and that only, defeated us.\" Then quoth to them the ancient one, the Lady of Calamities, \"In very sooth nought shall profit you, except ye draw you nigh unto the Messiah and put your trust in the True Belief, for, by the virtue of the Messiah, the whole strength of the Moslem host lieth in that Satan, King Sharrkan.\" \"Tomorrow,\" said King Afridun, \"I have resolved to draw up in battle array and to send out against them that redoubtable cavalier, L\u00fak\u00e1 bin Shaml\u00fat; for if King Sharrkan come forth as a champion to fight single handed, our man will slay him and will slay the other Moslem Knights, till not one is left. And I purpose this night to sacre you all with the Holy Incense.\" When the Emirs heard these words they kissed the ground before him. Now the incense which he designated was the excrement of the Chief Patriarch, the denier, the defiler of the Truth, and they sought for it with such instance, and they so highly valued it that the high priests of the Greeks used to send it to all the countries of the Christians in silken wraps after mixing it with musk and ambergris. Hearing of it Kings would pay a thousand gold pieces for every dram and they sent for and sought it to fumigate brides withal; and the Chief Priests and the great Kings were wont to use a little of it as collyrium for the eyes and as a remedy in sickness and colic; and the Patriarchs used to mix their own skite[FN#390] with it, for that the skite of the Chief Patriarch could not suffice for ten countries.[FN#391] So, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen, and King Afridun,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninetieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and King Afridun summoned his chief Knights and Nobles and invested them with dresses of honour; and, drawing the sign of the cross on their brows, incensed them with the incense which as aforesaid was the skite of the Chief Patriarch, the Cohen, the Heresiarch. This incensing done, he called for Luka bin Shamlut, surnamed the Sword of the Messiah; and, after fumigating him and rubbing his palate with the Holy Merde, caused him to snuff it and smeared his cheeks and anointed his moustaches with the rest. Now there was no stouter champion in the land of Roum than this accursed Luka, nor any better at bending of bow or sway of sword or lunge with lance on the day of devoir; but he was foul of favour, for his face was as the face of an ass, his shape that of an ape and his look as the look of a malignant snake: his presence was grievouser than parting from the beloved make; and blacker than night was his blackness and more fetid than the lion was his breath for foulness; more crooked than a bow was his crookedness and grimmer than the leopard was his ugliness, and he was branded with the mark of the Infidels on face.[FN#392] After this he came up to King Afridun and kissed his feet and stood before him; and the King said to him, \"I desire thou go out against Sharrkan, King of Damascus, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and deliver us from this affliction.\" Quoth Luka, \"Hearkening and obedience;\" and the King made the sign of the cross on his forehead and felt assured of help from Heaven being near hand. Then Luka went out from the presence and the accursed one mounted a sorrel horse; he was clad in a red robe and a hauberk of gold set with jewels, and he bore a trident spear, as he were Iblis the damned on the day of drewing out his hosts war to darraign. Then he rode forward, he and his horde of Infidels, even as though they were driving to the Fire, preceded by a herald, crying aloud in the Arabic tongue and saying, \"Ho, sect of Mohammed (upon whom be salutation and salvation!), let none of you come out but your champion Sharrkan, the Sword of Al-Islam, Lord of Damascus in Sh\u00e1m[FN#393]!\" Nor had he made an end of speaking, when arose a tumult in the plain; all the people heard the strain and the whole moving bodies of the armies twain called to mind the Day of Complain. Then the cowards trembled and all necks turned towards the sound, and lo! it was King Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. For when his brother, Zau al-Makan, saw that accursed one push out on the plain, and heard the pursuivant, he turned to Sharrkan and said to him, \"Of a surety they seek for thee.\" Said he, \"Should it so be, 'twere most pleasing to me.\" So when they made sure of the matter and heard the herald crying in the plain, \"Let none of you come out against me save Sharrkan,\" they knew this cursed Luka to be champion of the land of Roum who had sworn to sweep the earth clean of Moslems. Now he was one of the greatest of villains, a wretch who caused hearts to pain; and the DayIamites, Turks and Kurds dreaded his might and main. Presently Sharrkan crave at him like a lion angry grim, mounted on a courser like a wild gazelle flying snell and slim; and coming nigh to him made the spear he hent to shake as it were a darting snake, and recited these couplets,\n\n\"I have a sorrel steed, whose pride is fain to bear the rein, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall give thee what thou likest not and make thee feel his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     main:\nI have a handy limber spear full bright and keen of point, * Upon\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     whose shaft the dam of Death her throny seat hath ta'en:\nI have a trenchant glaive of Hind; and, when I bare its face * Of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     scabbard\" veil, from out its brow the rays of levee rain.\"\n\nLuka understood not the sense of his speech nor did he apprehend the vehemence of the verse; but he smote his forehead with his hand, in honour of the Cross drawn thereon and kissed it; then he couched his throw spear and ran at Sharrkan. But first he tossed the javelin with one hand in air to such height that it was lost to the spectators' sight; and, catching it with the other hand as do the jugglers, hurled it at Sharrkan. It flew from his grasp like a shooting star and folk clamoured and feared for Sharrkan; but, as the spear flew near him, he put out his hand and caught it in full flight to the amazement of all who saw the sight. Then he shook it with the hand that took it till it was well nigh broken, and hurled it so high into the welkin that it disappeared from view. As it descended, he caught it again with the other hand, in less than the twinkling of an eye, and cried out from his heart core, saying, \"By the truth of Him who created the sevenfold skies, I will assuredly make this cursed wight a byword for mankind to despise!\" Then threw he the throw spear at Luka, who thought to do as Sharrkan had done and put forth his hand to trend it in mid flight; but Sharrkan prevented him, and sped at him a second throw spear which smote him and the point fell on his forehead, in the very centre of the sign of the Cross, and Allah hurried his soul to the Fire and Dwelling place dire.[FN#394] But when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and they cried, \"Alas!\" and \"Woe worth the day!\" and called for aid upon the Abbots of the monasteries,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and cried, \"Alas!\" and \"Woe worth the day!\" and called upon the Abbots of the monasteries and cried, \"Where be the crosses?\" So the Religious offered up prayers and the Christians all drew together against Sharrkan; and, brandishing their scymitars and lances, rushed forward to the attack. Then army met army and breasts fell under hoof, whilst spear and sword ruled the day and forearms and wrists grew weak and the coursers seemed created without legs;[FN#395] nor did the herald of-war cease calling to fight, till arms were aweary and day took flight and night came on with darkness dight. So the two hosts drew apart, whilst every brave staggered like a drunken knave, for that with so much cut and thrust they strave; and the place was choked with the slain; fell were the wounds and the hurt knew not by whom they fell. Then Sharrkan joined his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the Chamberlain and the Wazir Dandan, and said to them, \"Verily Allah hath opened a door for the Infidels to fall, praised be the Lord of the Worlds one and all!\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"Let us never cease to praise Allah, for that He hath dispelled trouble from the Arab and the Ajam. Indeed the folk, generation after generation, shall tell of thy derring do against the accursed Luka, the falsifier of the Evangel;[FN#396] of thy catching the throng spear in mid-flight, and how the enemy of Allah among men thou didst smite; and thy fame shall endure until the end of time.\" Then said Sharrkan, \"Harkye, O grand Chamberlain and doughty Capitayne!\" and he answered, \"Adsum!\"[FN#397] Quoth Sharrkan, \"Take with thee the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand horse, and lead them seven parasangs towards the sea, and force the march till ye shall have come near the shore, and there remain only two parasangs between thee and the foe. Then ambush ye in the hollows of the ground till ye hear the tumult of the Infidels disembarking from their ships; and the war cry from every side strike your ear and ye know that the sabres have begun labour between us and them; and, whenso ye see our troops falling back, as if defeated, and all the Infidels following them, as well those in front as those from the seaward and the tents, do ye still lie in wait for them: but as soon as ye see the standard with the words, There is no god but the God, and Mohammed is God's Apostle (on whom be salutation and salvation!), then up with the green banner, and do your endeavour and fall on their rear and shout, 'Alla ho Akbar! Allah is most Great!' and circle round that they may not interpose between the retreating army and the sea.\" He replied, \"To hear is to obey!\"; and forthright they agreed upon this matter and they went forth. Now the Chamberlain took with himself the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand men even as Sharrkan had commanded. As soon as dawned the morn, the troops sprung to horse when they had donned their armour gear and drawn the scymitar and slung the spear. Then the Christians dispread themselves over hill and dale and the Ecclesiasts[FN#398] cried out and all heads were bared, and those in the ships hoisted the Cross at their mast heads and began making for shore from every side, and landed their horses and get them ready for fight and fray, whilst the sword blades glittered bright and the javelins glanced like levee light on mail shirt white; and all joined fight and the grind mill of Death whirled round and ground those who fought from horse and aground: heads from bodies flew end tongues mute grew and eyes no vision knew. Scymitars strave with utmost strain and heads flew over the battle plain; gall bladders crave and wrists were shorn in twain; steeds plashed in pools of gore and beards were gripped right sore; the host of Al-Islam called out, saying, \"On the Prince of Mankind be blessings and peace, and to the Compassionate glory and praise, which ne'er shall cease, for His boons which aye increase;\" and the host of the Infidels shouted, \"Glory to the Cross and the Belt and the vine press juice, and the wine presser and the Priests and the Monks and the Festival of Palms and the Metropolitan!\" Now Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan held back and their troops gave way and feigned flight from before the enemy, while the Infidel array pressed hard upon them deeming them in rout, and made ready to foin and hew. Then the meiny of the Moslems raised their voices, reciting the first verses of the Chapter of the Cow,[FN#399] whilst the dead were trampled under hoofs of steeds, and the heralds of the Greeks cried out, \"Ho, servants of the Messiah! Ho, people of the True Faith! Ho, followers of the Primate![FN#400] Verily Divine grace upon you opes; for see, the hosts of Al Islam like birds with broken wings incline to elope! So turn ye not to them your backs, but let your swords cleave deep in their necks and hold not your hands from them, else are ye outcasts from the Messiah, Mary's son, who spoke even when a cradled one!\"[FN#401] Now Afridun, King of Constantinople, deemed that the Infidels were victorious, knowing not that this was but a clever stratagem of the Moslems, and sent to King Hardub of Roum congratulations on success, adding, \"Availed us naught but the Holy Merde of the Arch Patriarch, whose fragrance exhaled from the beards and mustachios of the slaves of the Cross near and far; and I swear, by the Miracles of the Messiah; and by thy daughter Abrizah, the Nazarene, the Mariolater; and by the Waters of Baptism, that I will not leave upon the earth a single defender of Al- Islam! And to the bitter end will I carry out this plan.\" So the messenger betook himself with the address to King Hardub, whilst the Infidels called to one another saying, \"Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Infidels called to one another, saying, \"Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!\" while Hardub King of Greece cried aloud, \"Ho, to our revenge for Abrizah!\" Thereupon King Zau al-Makan shouted \"Ho, servants of the Requiting King!: smite the children of denial and disobedience with the blanch of sword and the brown of spear!\" So the Moslems returned to the Infidels and plied them with the keen edged scymitar, whilst their herald cried aloud, \"Up, and at the foes of the Faith, all ye who love the Prophet Elect, with hope of salvation on the Day of Fear, to win favour of the Bountiful, the Forgiving One; for verily the Garden of Paradise is under the shadow of swords!\" And behold, Sharrkan and his men charged down upon the Infidels and cut off their retreat and wheeled and tourneyed among the ranks; when lo! a knight of goodly presence opened a passage through the army of Unbelievers and circled hither and thither amongst the Deniers, cutting and thrusting and covering the ground with heads and trunks, so that the Faithless feared him and their necks bent under his lunge and hew. He was girt with two swords, his glances and his brand, and he was armed with two lances, one of bamboo cane and the other his straight wand like shape; and his flowing hair stood him in stead of many warriors, even as saith the poet,\n\n\"Laud not long hair,[FN#402] except it be dispread * In two fold\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    locks, on day of fight and fray,\nO'er youth who bears his lance 'twixt flank and thigh, * From\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     many a whis kered knight to win the day.\"\nAnd as singeth another,\n\n\"I say to him, what while he slings his sword, * 'For sword shall\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     serve those looks that sword like show!'\nSays he, 'My sabre looks for those I love, * My sword for those\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     who sweets of love unknow!'\"\n\nWhen Sharrkan saw him, he said to him, \"I conjure thee by the Koran and the attributes of the Compassionate One, O Champion of the Champions! tell me who thou art: for verily by thy deeds this day thou hast pleased the Requiting King, whom one thing distracteth not from other thing; in that thou hast been discomforting the children of impiety and in rebellion revelling.\" Then cried the Cavalier to him saying, \"Thou art he who madest brother covenant with me but yesterday: how quickly thou hast forgotten me!\" Thereupon he withdrew his mouth veil,[FN#403] so that what was hidden of his beauty was disclosed, and lo! it was none other than Zau al-Makan. Then Sharrkan rejoiced in his brother, save that he feared for him the rush of fighting and the crush of braves a smiting; and this for two reasons, the first, his tender age and exposure to the evil eye, and the second, that his safety was to the kingdom the greater of the two overshadowing wings. So he said to him, \"O King! thou riskest thy life, so join thy steed to mine; in very sooth I fear for thee from the foe; and better thou stint hazarding thyself forth of these squadrons, that we may shoot at the enemy thine unerring shaft.\" Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"I desire to even thee in fray and I will not be niggard of myself before thee in the melay.\" Then the host of Al-Islam, heaping itself upon the Infidels, girt them on all sides, warred on them a right Holy War, and brake the power of the children of impiety and pride and stowre. But King Afridun sighed when he saw the evil wreak that had fallen on the Greek, and they turned their backs from fight and addressed themselves to flight, making for the ships, when lo! there came out upon them from the seacoast another host, led by the Minister Dandan, the champion who was wont to make champions bite the dust, and to lay load on them with cut and thrust. Nor less came forth the Emir Bahram, Lord of the Provinces of Sham, amid twenty thousand horse doughty of arm; and the host of Al-Islam pressed them in front and on flank and wrought them grievous harm. Then a body of the Moslems turned against those who in the ships remained, and perdition on them rained, till they threw themselves into the main, and they slew of them many slain, more than a hundred thousand noblemen, nor was one of their champions, great or small, saved from bale and bane. Moreover, they took their ships, with all the money and treasure and cargo, save a score of keel, and the Moslems got that loot whose like was never gotten in by gone years; nor was such cut and thrust ever heard of by men's ears.[FN#404] Now amongst the booty were fifty thousand horses, besides treasure and spoil past reckoning and arithmetic, whereat the Moslems rejoiced with an exceeding joy for that Allah had given them victory and protection. Such was the case with them; but as regards the fugitive Infidels they soon reached Constantinople, whither the tidings preceded them that King Afridun had prevailed over the Moslems; so quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, \"I know that my son Hardub, King of Roum, is no runagate and that he feareth not the Islamitic hosts, but will restore the whole world to the Nazarene faith.\" Then she bade the Great King, Afridun, give command that the city be decorated, and the people held festival high and drank their wines drunkenly and knew not the decrees of Destiny. Now whilst they were in the midst of their rejoicings, behold, the raven of dule and downfall croaked over them, and up came the twenty fugitive ships wherein was the King of C\u00e6sarea. So King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, met them on the sea shore, and they told him all that had befallen them from the Moslem, and they wept sore and groaned and moaned; and rejoicing at weal was turned into dismay for unheal; and they informed him concerning Luka son of Shamlut, how calamity had betided him and how Death had shot him with his shaft. Thereat the horrors of Doomday rose upon King Afridun,[FN#405] and he knew that there was no making straight their crook. Then came up from them the sound of weeping and wailing; the city was full of men mourning and the keepers were keening, and sighs and cries were heard from all sides. And when King Hardub of Greece met King Afridun he told him the truth of the case and how the flight of the Moslems was by way of stratagem and deceit, and said to him, \"Look not to see any of the army, save those who have already reached thee.\" When King Afridun heard these words he fell down in a fainting fit, with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, he exclaimed, \"Surely the Messiah was wroth with them that he caused the Moslems to prevail over them!\" Then came the Arch Patriarch sadly to the King who said to him, \"O our father, annihilation hath overtaken our army and the Messiah hath punished us!\" Replied the Patriarch, \"Grieve not nor feel concerned, for it cannot be but that one of you have sinned against the Messiah, and all have been punished for his offence; but now we will read prayers for you in the churches, that the Mohammeden hosts may be repelled from you.\" After which the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, came to Afridun and said to him, \"O King, verily the Moslem hosts are many, and we shall never overcome them save by wile: wherefore I purpose to work upon them by guile and repair to this army of Al-Islam, haply I may win my wish of their leader and slay their champion, even as I slew his father. If my stratagem succeed in his case, not one of the host he leads shall return to his native land, for all are strong only because of him; but I desire to have some Christian dwellers of Syria, such as go out every month and year to sell their goods, that they may help me (for this they can do) in carrying out my plan.\" Replied the King, \"Be it so whenever thou wilt.\" So she bade fetch an hundred men, natives of Najr\u00e1n,[FN#406] in Sham, and the King asked them, \"Have ye not heard what hath befallen the Christians with the Moslems?\" \"Yes,\" answered they; and he rejoined, \"Know ye that this woman hath devoted her life to the Messiah and purposeth to go forth with you, disguised as Monotheists and Mohammedans, to work out a device which shall profit us and hinder the Moslem from us: say, then, are ye also willing to devote yourselves to the Anointed and I will give you a quintal of gold?[FN#407] He of you who escapeth shall have the money, and him of you who dieth will the Messiah reward.\" \"O King,\" replied they, \"we will devote our lives to the Messiah, and we will be thy sacrifice.\" Thereupon the old woman took all she required of aromatic roots and placed them in water which she boiled over the fire till the black essence of them was extracted. She waited till the decoction was cold, then dipped the corner of a long kerchief therein and stained her face therewith. Moreover, she donned over her clothes a long gaberdine with an embroidered border and took in her hand a rosary, and afterwards went in to King Afridun, who knew her not, nor did any of his companions know her, till she discovered herself to them: and there was none in the assembly but who thanked and praised her for her cunning; and her son rejoiced and said, \"May the Messiah never fail thee!\" Thereupon she took with her the Syrian Christians, and set out for the army of Baghdad.\u2014 And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Afridun heard these words, he fell into a fainting fit with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, fear fluttered the scrotum[FN#408] below his belly and he complained to the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi. Now this accursed old woman was a witch of the witches, past mistress in sorcery and deception; wanton and wily, deboshed and deceptious; with foul breath, red eyelids, yellow cheeks, dull brown face, eyes bleared, mangy body, hair grizzled, back humped, skin withered and wan and nostrils which ever ran. But she had studied the scriptures of Al-Islam and had made the Pilgrimage to the Holy House of Meccah and all this that she might come to the knowledge of the Mohammedan ordinances and the miraculous versets of the Koran; and she had professed Judaism in the Holy City of Jerusalem[FN#409] for two years' space, that she might master the magic of men and demons; so that she was a plague of plagues and a pest of pests, wrong headed as to belief and to no religion fief. Now the chief reason of her sojourn with her son, King Hardub of Greece, was on account of the slave virgins at his court: for she was given to tribadism[FN#410] and could not exist without sapphism or she went mad: so if any damsel pleased her, she was wont to teach her the art of rubbing clitoris against clitoris and would anoint her with saffron[FN#411] till she fainted away for excess of volupty. Whoso obeyed her she was wont to favour and make her son incline towards her; but whoso repelled her she would contrive to destroy; and so she abode for a length of time. This was known to Marjanah and Rayh\u00e1nah and Utrijah, the handmaids of Abrizah, and their Princess loathed the old woman and abhorred to lie with her, because of the rank smell from her armpits, the stench of her fizzles more fetid than carrion, and the roughness of her hide coarser than palm fibre. She was wont to bribe those who rubbed parts with her by means of jewels and instructions; but Abrizah held aloof from her and sought refuge with the Omnipotent, the Omniscient; for, by Allah, right well quoth the poet,\n\n\"Ho thou who grovellest low before the great * Nor over fording\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     lesser men dost blench\nWho gildest dross by dirham gathering, * No otter scent disguises\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     carrion stench!\n\nAnd now to return to the story of her stratagem and the woes of her working. Presently she departed, taking the chief Nazarenes with their hosts, and turned towards the army of the Moslems. Whereupon King Hardub went in to King Afridun and said to him, \"O King, we have no need of the Chief Patriarch nor of his prayers, but will consult my mother's counsel and observe what she will do with her craft unending against the Moslem hosts; for these are marching with all their power, they will soon be upon us and they will encircle us on all sides.\" When King Afridun heard this, terror took hold upon his heart and he wrote letters, without stay or delay, to all the nations of the Nazarenes, saying, \"It behoveth none of the Messiahites or Cross knights to hold back, especially the folk of the strongholds and forts: but let them all come to us, foot and horse, women and children, for the Moslem hosts already tread our soil. So haste! haste ye! ere what we fear to us here appear.\" Thus much concerning them; but regarding the work of the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi; when she went forth from the city with her suite, she clad them in the clothing of Moslem merchants, having provided herself with an hundred mules carrying stuffs of Antioch, such as goldwoven satins and royal brocades and so forth. And she had taken a letter from King Afridun to the following effect: \"These be merchantmen from the land of Sham who have been with us: so it besitteth none to do them harm or hindrance, nor take tax and tithe of them, till they reach their homes and safe places, for by merchants a country flourisheth, and these are no men of war nor of ill faith.\" Then quoth the accursed Zat al-Dawahi to those with her, \"Verily I wish to work out a plot for the destruction of the Moslem.\" Replied they, \"O Queen, command us whatso thou wilt; we are at thy disposal and may the Messiah never disappoint thy dealings!\" Then she donned a gown of fine white wool and rubbed her forehead, till she made a great mark as of a scar and anointed it with an ointment of her own fashion, so that it shone with prodigious sheen. Now the old hag was lean bodied and hollow eyed, and she bound her legs tightly round with cords[FN#412] just above her feet, till she drew near the Moslem camp, when she unwound them, leaving their marks deeply embedded in her ankles. Then she anointed the wheels with dragon's blood and bade her companions beat her with a severe beating, and set her in a chest and, quoth she, \"Cry abroad the Refrain of Unity,[FN#413] nor fear from it aught of damage!\" Replied they, \"How can we beat thee, who be our sovereign lady, Zat al-Dawahi, mother of the King we glory in?\" Then said she, \"We blame not nor deal reproach to him who goeth to the jakes, and in need evil becometh good deed. When ye have set me in the chest, take it and make it one of the bales and place it on mule back and fare forth with it and the other goods through the Moslem camp, and fear ye no blame. And if any of the Moslems hinder you, give up the mules and their lading and be take yourselves to their King, Zau al-Makan, and implore his protection saying, 'We were in the land of the Infidels and they took nothing from us, but wrote us a passport, that none shall do us hindrance or work our mischance.' If he ask you, 'What profit had ye of your property in the land of Roum?' answer him, 'We profited in the deliverance of a pious man, who had been bound down in an underground cell nigh fifteen years, crying out for help yet none helped him. Nay, the Infidels tortured him night and day. We knew not this; but, after we had tarried in Constantinople for some time, having sold our goods and bought others in their stead, we determined on and made ready for a return to our native land. We spent that night conversing about our journey and when day broke, we saw figured upon the wall a human form and as we drew nigh it, behold, it moved and said, 'O Moslems, is there amongst you one who is minded to woo the favour of the Lord of the three Worlds?'[FN#414] 'How so?' asked we; and the figure answered, 'Know that Allah hath made me speak to you, to the intent that your faith be fortified, and that your belief embolden you and that you may go forth of the country of the Infidels and repair to the Moslem host; for with them wones the Sword of the Com passionate One, of our Age the Champion, King Sharrkan, by whom He shall conquer Constantinople town and destroy the sect of the Nazarene. And when ye shall have journeyed three days, you will find an hermitage known as the Hermitage of the ascetic Matruhina[FN#415] and containing a cell; visit it with pure intent and contrive to arrive there by force of will, for therein is a Religious from the Holy City, Jerusalem, by name Abdullah, and he is one of the devoutest of mankind, endowed with the power of working saintly miracles[FN#416] such as dispel doubts and obscurity. Certain of the monks seized him by fraud and shut him up in a souterrain where he hath lain a long time. By his deliverance you will please the Lord of Faithful Men, for such release is better than fighting for the Faith.'\" Now when the ancient dame and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, \"As soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan, say him further, 'Hearing this from that image we knew that the holy man'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, \"Now as soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan say him further, 'Hearing these words from that image we knew that the holy man was indeed of the chiefest devotees and Allah's servants of purest qualities; so we made three days' march till we came in sight of that hermitage, and then we went up to it and passed the day in buying and selling, as is the wont of merchants. As soon as day had departed our sight and night was come to darken light, we repaired to the cell wherein was the dungeon, and we heard the holy man, after chanting some verses of the Koran, repeat the following couplets,\n\n'My heart disheartened is, my breast is strait, * And sinks my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    soul in sea of bale and bate\nUnless escape be near I soon shall die; * And Death were better\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     than this doleful strait:\nO Lightning an thou light my home and folk, * An their still\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     brighter charms thy shine abate,\nSay, what my path to meet them, being barred * By wars, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     barricado'd succour's gate?'\n\n\"When once ye have brought me into the Moslem camp, and I mix with them you shall see,\" the old woman continued, \"how I will make shift to beguile them and slay them all, even to the last man.\" The Nazarenes hearing whet she said, kissed her hands and set her in the chest, after they had beaten her with a grievous beating in obedience to her commands, for they saw it was incumbent on them to do her bidding in this; then they all made for the Moslem host as hath erst been said. Such was the case with the damned hag, Zat al-Dawahi and her companions; but as regards the Mohammeden army, they indeed, after Allah had given them victory over their enemies and they had plundered everything in the ships of money and hoards, all sat down to converse with one another and Zau al-Makan said to his brother Sharrkan, \"Verily, Allah hath granted us to prevail because of our just dealing and discipline and concord amongst ourselves; wherefore continue, O Sharrkan, to obey my commandment, in submission to Allah (be He exalted and extolled!), for I mean to slay ten Kings in blood revenge for my sire, to cut the throat of fifty thousand Greeks and to enter Constantinople.\" Replied Sharrkan, \"My life be thy ransom against death! Needs must I follow out the Holy War, though I wone many a year in their country. But I have, O my brother, in Damascus a daughter, named Kuzia Fakan, whom I love heartily for she is one of the marvels of the time and she will soon be of age.' Said Zau al-Makan, \"And I also have left my wife with child and near her time, nor do I know what Allah will vouchsafe me by her. But promise me, O my brother, that if Allah bless me with a son, thou wilt grant me thy daughter for wife to him, and make covenant with me and pledge me thy faith thereon.\" \"With love and good will, replied Sharrkan; and, stretching out his hand to his brother, he said, If she bring thee a son, I will give him my daughter Kuzia Fakan, to wife.\" At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, and they fell to congratulating each other on the victory over the enemy. And the Wazir Dandan also congratulated the two brothers and said to them, \"Know, O ye Kings, that Allah hath given us the victory, for that we have devoted our lives to Him (be He exalted and ex tolled!); and we have left our homes and households; and it is my counsel that we follow up the foe and press upon him and harass him, so haply Allah shall enable us to win our wishes, and we shall destroy our enemies, branch and root. If it please you, do ye go down in these ships and sail over the sea, whilst we fare forward by land and bear the brunt of battle and the thrust of fight.\" And the Minister Dandan ceased not to urge them to combat and repeated his words who said,\n\n\"To slay my foes is chiefest bliss I wist, * And on the courser's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    back be borne a list;\nComes promising tryst a messenger from friend * Full oft, when\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    comes the friend withouten tryst.\"\nAnd these words of another,\n\n\"War for my mother (an I live) I'll take; * Spear for my brother;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   scymitar for sire\nWith every shag haired brave who meets his death * Smiling, till\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   won from Doom his dear desire!\"\n\nAnd when the Wazir ended his verses, he said, \"Praise be to Him who aided us dear victory to uphold and who hath given us spoil of silver and fine gold!\" Then Zau al-Makan commanded the army to depart; and they fared on forcing their marches for Constantinople, till they came to a wide and spacious champaign, full of all things fair and fain, with wild cattle frisking and gazelles pacing to and fro across the plain. Now they had traversed great deserts and drink had been six days cut off from them, when they drew near this meadow and saw therein waters founting and ripe fruits daunting and that land as it were Paradise; for it had donned its adornments and decked itself.[FN#417] Gently waved the branches of its trees drunken with the new wine of the dew, and combined with the nectar of Tasnim the soft breathings of the morning breeze. Mind and gazer were confounded by its beauty, even as saith the poet,\n\n\"Behold this lovely garden! 'tis as though * Spring o'er its\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   frame her greeny cloak had spread.\nLooking with fleshly eyne, thou shalt but sight * A lake whose\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    waters balance in their bed,\nBut look with spirit eyes and lo! shalt see * Glory in every\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   leaf o'erwaves thy head.\"\n\nAnd as another saith,\n\n\"The stream's a cheek by sunlight rosy dyed, * Whose down[FN#418]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  is creeping shade of tamarisk stems\nRound legs of tree trunks waveless roll in rings * Silvern, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   blossoms are the diadems.\"\n\nWhen Zau al-Makan saw this champaign, with its trees bowing and its flowers blooming and its birds warbling, he called to his brother Sharrkan and said, \"O my brother, verily in Damascus is naught the like of this place. We will not march from it save after three days, that we may take rest ourselves and that the army of Al-Islam may regain strength and their souls be fortified to encounter the blamed Infidels.\" So they halted therein and while camping behold, they heard a noise of voices from afar, and Zau al-Makan asked the cause thereof, and was answered that a caravan of merchants from the Land of Syria had halted there to rest and that the Moslem troops had come on them and had haply seized something of the goods which they had brought from the country of the Infidels. After a while up came the merchants, crying out and appealing to the King for aidance. When Zau al- Makan saw this, he bade them be brought before him and, when in presence they said to him, \"O King, we have been in the country of the Infidels and they plundered us of nothing: why then do our brothers the Moslems despoil our goods, and we in their own land? Of a truth when we saw your troops, we went up to them and they robbed us of what we had with us and we have now reported to thee all that hath befallen us.\" Thereupon they brought out to him the letter of the King of Constantinople, and Sharrkan read it and said, \"We will presently restore to you what hath been taken from you; but yet it behoveth you not to carry merchandise to the country of the Infidels.\" Replied they, \"O our Lord, in very sooth Allah despatched us thither that we might win what Gh\u00e1zi[FN#419] never won the like of, not even thou in all thy razzias.\" Asked Sharrkan, \"What was it ye won?\" \"O King,\" answered they, \"we will not tell thee save in private; for if this matter be noised among the folk, haply it may come to the ears of some,[FN#420] and this will be the cause of our ruin and of the ruin of all Moslems who resort to the land of the Greeks.\" Now they had hidden the chest wherein was the damned Zat al- Dawahi. So Zau al-Makan and his brother brought them to a private place, where they laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee, and wept till they made the two Kings weep.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Nazarenes who wore merchants' weed, when brought to a private place by Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan, laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two Kings weep and repeated to them all which had been taught by the old witch Zat al-Dawahi. Thereupon Sharrkan's heart yearned to the devotee and he was moved to ruth for him and was fired with zeal for the service of Almighty Allah. So quoth he to them, \"Did ye rescue this holy man or is he still in the hermitage?\" Quoth they, \"We delivered him and slew the hermit, fearing for our lives; after which we made haste to fly for dread of death; but a trusty man told us that in this hermitage are quintals of gold and silver and stones of price.\" Then they fetched the chest and brought out the accursed old woman, as she were a cassia pod[FN#421] for excess of blackness and leanness, and she was laden with the same fetters and shackles. When Zau al-Makan and the bystanders saw her, they took her for a man of the best of Allah's devotees and surpassing in pious qualities, more especially because of the shining of her forehead for the ointment wherewith she had anointed her face. So Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan wept sore; then they rose up in honour and kissed her hands and feet, sobbing aloud: but she signed to them and said, \"Cease this weeping and hear my words. Hereat they dried their tears in obedience to her bidding, and she said, \"Know ye both that I was content to accept what my Lord did unto me, for I kenned that the affliction which befel me was a trial from Him (be He exalted and extolled!); and whoso hath not patience under calamity and tribulation, for him there is no coming to the delights of Paradise. I had indeed supplicated Him that I might return to my native land, not as a compensation for the sufferings decreed to me, but that I might die under the horse hoofs of warriors fighting for the Faith who, being slain in fray, live again without suffering death.\"[FN#422] Then she repeated the following couplets,\n\n\"Our Fort is Tor,[FN#423] and flames the fire of fight: * Moses\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    art thou and this is time for aid:\nCast down thy rod, 'twill swallow all they wrought, * Nor dread\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    for men their ropes be vipers made.[FN#424]\nFor Chapters read on fight day lines of foes, * And on their\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    necks 'grave versets[FN#425] wi' thy blade!\"\n\nWhen the old woman had ended her verse, her eyes overflowed with tears and her forehead under the unguent shone like gleaming light, and Sharrkan rose and kissed her hand and caused food be brought before her: but she refused it, saying, \"I have not broken my fast by day for fifteen years; and how should I break it at such a time when my Lord hath been bountiful to me in delivering me from the captivity of the Infidels and removing from me that which was more grievous to me than torment of fire? I will wait till sun down.\" So when it was nightfall, Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan came and served her with food and said, \"Eat, O ascetic!\" But she said, \"This is no time for eating; it is the time for worshipping the Requiting King.\" Then she stood up in the prayer niche and remained praying till the night was spent; and she ceased not to do after this fashion for three days and nights, sitting not but at the time of the Sal\u00e1m or salutation[FN#426] ending with several prayers. When Zau al- Makan saw her on this wise, firm belief in her get hold of his heart and he said to Sharrkan, \"Cause a tent of perfumed leather to be pitched for this Religious, and appoint a body servant to wait upon him.\" On the fourth day she called for food; so they brought her all kinds of meats that could seduce the sense or delight the sight; but of all this she would eat only a scone with salt. Then she again turned to her fast and, as the night came, she rose anew to pray; when Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, \"Verily, this man carrieth renunciation of the world to the extreme of renouncing, and, were it not for this Holy War, I would join myself to him and worship Allah in his service, till I came before His presence. And now I desire to enter his tent and talk with him for an hour.\" Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"And I also: tomorrow we sally forth to fight against Constantinople, and we shall find no time like the present.\" Said the Wazir Dandan, \"And I no less desire to see this ascetic; haply he will pray for me that I find death in this Holy War and come to the presence of my Lord, for I am aweary of the world.\" So as soon as night had darkened, they repaired to the tent of that witch, Zat al-Dawahi; and, seeing her standing to pray, they drew near her and fell a weeping for pity of her; but she paid no heed to them till midnight was past, when she ended her orisons by pronouncing the salutation. Then she turned to them and after wishing them long life, asked them \"Wherefore come ye?\", whereto they answered, \"O thou holy man! diddest thou not hear us weep around thee?\" She rejoined, \"To him who standeth in the presence of Allah, remaineth no existence in time, either for hearing any or for seeing aught about him.\" Quoth they, \"We would have thee recount to us the cause of thy captivity and pray for us this night, for that will profit us more than the possession of Constantinople.\" Now when she heard their words she said, \"By Allah, were ye not the Emirs of the Moslems, I would not relate to you aught of this at any time; for I complain not but to Allah alone. However, to you I will relate the circumstances of my captivity. Know, then, that I was in the saintly City of Jerusalem with certain ecstatics and inspired men, and did not magnify myself among them, for that Allah (be He exalted and extolled!) had endowed me with humility and abnegation, till I chanced to go down to the sea one night and walked upon the water. Then entered into me pride; whence I know not, and I said to myself, 'Who like me can walk the water?' And my heart from that time hardened and Allah afflicted me with the love of travel. So I journeyed to Roum land and visited every part for a whole year, and left no place but therein I worshiped Allah. When I came to this spot,[FN#427] I clomb the mountain and saw there an hermitage, inhabited by a monk called Matrubina, who, when he sighted me, came out and kissed my hands and feet and said, 'Verily, I have seen thee since thou enteredst the land of the Greeks, and thou hast filled me with longing for the land of Al-Islam.' Then he took my hand and carried me into that hermitage, and brought me to a dark room; and, when I entered it unawares, he locked the door on me and left me there forty days, without meat or drink; for it was his intent to kill me by delay. It chanced one day, that a Knight called Dakian\u00fas[FN#428] came to the hermitage, accompanied by ten squires and his daughter Tam\u00e1sil, a girl whose beauty was incom parable. When they entered that hermitage, the monk Matruhina told them of me, and the Knight said, 'Bring him out, for surely there is not on him a bird's meal of meat.' So they opened the door of the dark room and found me standing in the niche, praying and reciting the Koran and glorifying Allah and humbling myself before the Almighty. When they saw me in this state Matrohina exclaimed, 'This man is indeed a sorcerer of the sorcerers!'; and hearing his words, they all came in on me, Dakianus and his company withal, and they beat me with a grievous beating, till I desired death and reproached myself, saying, 'This is his reward who exalteth himself and who prideth himself on that which Allah hath vouchsafed to him, beyond his own competence! And thou, O my soul, verily self esteem and arrogance have crept into thee. Dost thou not know that pride angereth the Lord and hardeneth the heart and bringeth men to the Fire?' Then they laid me in fetters and returned me to my place which was the dungeon under ground. Every three days, they threw me down a scone of barley bread and a draught of water; and every month or two the Knight came to the hermitage. Now his daughter Tamasil had grown up, for she was nine years old when I first saw her, and fifteen years passed over me in captivity, so that she had reached her four and twentieth year. There is not in our land nor in the land of the Greeks a fairer than she, and her father feared lest the King take her from him; for she had vowed herself to the Messiah and rode with Dakianus in the habit of a cavalier, so that albeit none might compare with her in loveliness, no one who saw her knew her for a woman. And her father had laid up his monies in this hermitage, every one who had aught of price or treasured hoard being wont to deposit it therein; and I saw there all manner of gold and silver and jewels and precious vessels and rarities, none may keep count of them save Almighty Allah. Now ye are worthier of these riches than those Infidels; so lay hands on that which is in the hermitage and divide it among the Moslems and especially on fighters in the Holy War. When these merchants came to Constantinople and sold their merchandise, that image which is on the wall spoke to them, by grace of a marvel which Allah granted to me; so they made for that hermitage and slew Matruhina, after torturing him with most grievous torments, and dragging him by the beard, till he showed them the place where I was; when they took me and found no path but flight for dread of death. Now tomorrow night Tamasil will visit that hermitage as is her habit, and her father and his squires will come after her, as he feareth for her; so, if ye would witness these things, take me with you and I will deliver to you the monies and the riches of the Knight Dakianus which be in that mountain; for I saw them bring out vessels of gold and silver to drink therefrom, and I heard a damsel of their company sing to them in Arabic and well-away! that so sweet a voice should not be busied in chaunting the Koran. If, then, ye will; enter into that hermitage and hide there against the coming of Dakianus and his daughter; and take her, for she is fit only for the King of the Age, Sharrkan, or King Zau al-Makan.\" Thereat they all rejoiced with the exception of the Wazir Dandan, who put scant faith in her story, for her words took no hold on his reason, and signs of doubt in her and disbelief showed in his face.[FN#429] Yet he was confounded at her discourse, but he feared to speak with her for awe of the King. Then quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, \"Verily, I fear lest the Knight come and, seeing these troops encamped in the meadow, be afraid to enter the hermitage.\" So Zau al-Makan ordered the army to march upon Constantinople and said, \"I have resolved to take with me an hundred horse and many mules and make for that mountain, where we will load the beasts with the monies which be in the hermitage.\" Then he sent at once for the Chief Chamberlain whom they brought into the presence; and he summoned likewise the leaders of the Turks and Daylamites and said, \"As soon as it is dawn, do ye set forth for Constantinople; and thou, O Chamberlain, shalt take my place in council and contrivance, while thou, O Rustam, shalt be my brother's deputy in battle. But let none know that we are not with you and after three days we will rejoin you.\" Then he chose out an hundred of the doughtiest riders, and he and Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan set out for the hermitage, and the hundred horsemen led the mules with chests for transporting the treasure.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan set off with an hundred horse for the hermitage described to them by that accursed Zat al-Dawahi, and they took with them mules and chests for transporting the treasure. Now as soon as dawned the morn, the Chamberlain signalled to the host an order for departure, and they set out thinking that the two Kings and the Wazir were with them; knowing not that the three had made for the monastery. Such was the case with the host, but as regards the two Kings and the Minister, they tarried in their place till the end of that day. Now the Infidels who were with Zat al-Dawahi took their departure privily, after they had gone in to her and kissed her hands and feet and obtained her leave to march. So she not only gave them permission but also taught them all she minded of wile and guile. And when it was dark night, she arose and went in to Zau al-Makan and his companions and said to them, \"Come, let us set out for the mountain, and take with you a few men at arms.\" They obeyed her and left five horsemen at the foot of the mountain, whilst the rest rode on before Zat al-Dawahi, who gained new strength for excess of joy, so that Zau al-Makan said, \"Glory be to Him who sustaineth this holy man, whose like we never saw!\" Now the witch had written a letter to the King of Constantinople and despatched it on the wings of a bird,[FN#430] acquainting him with what had passed and ending, \"I wish thee to send me ten thousand horsemen of the bravest of the Greeks and let them steal along the foot of the mountains with caution, lest the host of Al-Islam get sight of them; and, when they reach the hermitage, let them ambush themselves there, till I come to them with the Moslem King and his brother, for I shall inveigle them and will bring them thither, together with the Wazir and an hundred horse and no more, that I may presently deliver to them the crosses which be in the hermitage. I am resolved to slay the Monk Matruhina, since my scheme cannot be carried out but by taking his life. If my plot work well, not one of the Moslems shall return to his own country; no, not a living wight nor one who blows the fire alight; and Matruhina shall be a sacrifice for the followers of the Nazarene faith and the servants of the Cross, and praise be to the Messiah, first and last.\" When this letter reached Constantinople, the keeper of the carrier pigeons carried it to King Afridun, who read it and forthwith inspected his host and equipped ten thousand cavaliers with horses and dromedaries and mules and provaunt and bade them repair to that hermitage and, after reaching the tower, to hide therein. Thus far concerning them; but as regards King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan and the escort, when they reached the hermitage they entered and met the Monk Matruhina, who came out to see who and what they were; whereupon quoth that pious man Zat al-Dawahi, \"Slay this damned fellow.\"[FN#431] So they smote him with their swords and made him drink the cup of death. Then the accursed old woman carried them to the place of offerings and ex votos, and brought out to them treasures and precious things more than she had described to them; and after gathering the whole together, they set the booty in chests and loaded the mules therewith. As for Tamasil, she came not, she or her father, for fear of the Moslems; so Zau al-Makan tarried there, awaiting her all that day and the next and a third, till Sharrkan said to him, \"By Allah, I am troubled anent the army of Al-Islam, for I know not what is become of them.\" His brother replied, \"And I also am concerned for them: we have come by this great treasure and I do not believe that Tamasil or any one else will approach the hermitage, after that befel which hath befallen the host of the Christians. It behoveth us, then, to content ourselves with what Allah hath given us and depart; so haply He will help us conquer Constantinople.\" Accordingly they came down from the mountain, while Zat al-Dawahi was impotent to oppose their march for fear of betraying her deceit; and they fared forwards till they reached the head of a defile, where the old woman had laid an ambush for them with the ten thousand horse. As soon as these saw the Moslems they encircled them from all sides, couching lance and baring the white sabre blade; and the Infidels shouted the watch word of their faithless Faith and set the shafts of their mischief astring. When Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan looked upon this host, they saw that it was a numerous army and said, \"Who can have given these troops information of us?\" Replied Sharrkan, \"O my brother, this be no time for talk; this is the time for smiting with swords and shooting with shafts) so gird up your courage and hearten your hearts, for this strait is like a street with two gates; though, by the virtue of the Lord of Arabs and Ajams, were not the place so narrow I would bring them to naught, even though they were an hundred thousand men!\" Said Zau al-Makan, \"Had we wotted this we would have brought with us five thousand horse;\" and the Wazir Dandan continued, \"If we had ten thousand horse they had availed us naught in these narrows; but Allah will succour us against them. I know this defile and its straitness, and I know there be many places of refuge in it; for I have been here on razzia with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, what while we besieged Constantinople. We abode in this place, and here is water colder than snow. So come, let us push out of this defile ere the Infidel host increase on us and get the start of us to the mountain top, whence they will hurl down rocks upon us, and we powerless to come at them.\" So they began hurrying on to get out of those narrows; but the pious man, Zat al-Dawahi, looked at them and said, \"What is it ye fear, ye who have vowed yourselves to the Lord, and to working His will? By Allah, I abode imprisoned underground for fifteen years, yet never gainsaid the Almighty in aught he did with me! Fight ye in Allah's way; so whoever of you is slain Paradise shall be his abode, and whoso slayeth, his striving shall be to his honour.\" When they heard from the ascetic these words, their care and anxiety ceased from them and they stood firm till the Infidels charged down from all sides, whilst the swords played upon their necks and the cup of death went round amongst them. The Moslems fought for the service of Allah a right good fight, and wrought upon His foes with sway of sword and lunge of lance; whilst Zau al-Makan smote upon the men and garred the knights bite the dust and their heads from their bodies take flight, five by five and ten by ten, till he had done to death a number of them past numbering and an accompt beyond counting. Now while so doing, he looked at the accursed old woman who was waving her sword and heartening them, and all who feared fled to her for shelter; but she was also signing the Infidels to slay Sharrkan. So troop after troop rushed on him with design to do him die; but each troop that charged, he charged and drove back; and when another troop attacked him he repelled the assault with the sword in their backs; for he thought it was the devotee's blessing that gave him the vic tory, and he said in himself, \"Verily on this holy men Allah looketh with eyes of His favour and strengtheneth my prowess against the Infidels with the purity of his pious intent: for I see that they fear me and cannot prevail against me, but every one who assaileth me turneth tail and taketh flight.\" So they battled the rest of the day and, when night fell, the Moslems took refuge in a cave of that defile being weary with stress of war and cast of stone: and that day were slain of them five and forty. And when they were gathered together, they sought the devotee, but could find no trace of him; and this was grievous to them and they said, \"Belike, he hath died a martyr.\" Quoth Sharrkan, \"I saw him heartening the horsemen with divine instances and using as talisman verses of Holy Writ.\" Now while they were talking, behold, the accursed old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, stood before them, hending in hand the head of the Chief Captain of the ten thousand horse, a noble knight, a champion fierce in fight and a Satan for blight. One of the Turks had slain him with an arrow, and Allah hurried his soul to the fire; and when the Infidels saw what that Moslem had done with their leader, they all fell on him and wrought his bane and hewed him in pieces with their swords, and Allah hurried his soul to Heaven. Then the accursed old woman cut off that Knight's head and brought it and threw it at the feet of Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan. Now when Sharrkan sew her, he sprang up hastily before her and exclaimed, \"Praised be Allah for thy safety and for our sighting thee, O holy man and devout champion of the Religion!\" Replied she, O my son, I have sought martyrdom this day, and have thrown my life away amid the Infidel array, but they feared me with dismay. When ye dispersed, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight their leader, albeit he was a match for a thousand horse, and I smote him till I severed head from trunk. Not one of the Infidels could near me; so I brought his head to you,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damned witch, Zat al-Dawahi, took the head of the Knight, the leader of the twenty thousand Infidels, she brought it and threw it down before Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan, saying, \"When I saw your condition, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight and smote him with the sword till I severed head from trunk. And none could near me, so I brought his head to you, that you may be strengthened in Holy War and work out with your swords the will of the Lord of the Faithful. And now I purpose leaving you to strive against the Infidels, whilst I go to your army, though they be at the gates of Constantinople, and return with twenty thousand horse to destroy these Unfaithfuls.\" Quoth Sharrkan, \"How wilt thou pass to them, O thou holy man, seeing that the valley is blocked up on all sides by the Miscreants?\" Quoth the accursed hag, \"Allah will veil me from their eyes and they shall not sight me;[FN#432] nor, if any saw me, would he dare to attack me at that time, for I shall be as one non existing, absorbed in Allah, and He will fend off from me His foes.\" \"Thou sayest sooth, O holy man,\" rejoined Sharrkan, \"for indeed I have been witness of that; so, if thou can pass out at the first of the night, 'twill be best for us.\" Replied she, \"I will set out at this very hour and, if thou desire, thou shalt go with me and none shall see thee. Furthermore if thy brother also have a mind to go with us we will take him, but none else; for the shadow of a saint can cover only twain.\" Sharrkan said, \"As for me I will not leave my comrades; but, if my brother will, there is no harm in his going with thee and setting us free of this strait; for he is the stronghold of the Moslems and the sword of the Lord of the three Worlds; and if it be his pleasure, let him take with him the Wazir Dandan, or whom else he may elect and send us ten thousand horse to succour us against these caitiffs.\" So after debate they agreed on this and the old woman said, \"Give me leisure to go before you and consider the condition of the Infidels, if they be asleep or awake.\" Quoth they, \"We will not go forth save with thee and trust our affair to Allah.\" \"If I do your bidding,\" replied she, \"blame me not but blame yourselves; for it is my rede that you await me till I bring you tidings of the case.\" Then said Sharrkan, \"Go to them and delay not from us, for we shall be awaiting thee.\" Thereupon she fared forth and Sharrkan turned to his brother addressing him and said, \"Were not this holy man a miracle worker, he had never slain yonder furious knight. This is proof sufficient of the ascetic's power; and of a truth the pride of the Infidels is laid low by the slaying of this cavalier, for he was violent, an evil devil and a stubborn.\" Now whilst they were thus devising of the mighty works of the devotee, behold, the accursed Zat al-Dawahi came upon them and promised them victory over the Unbelievers; wherefor they thanked her (not knowing that all this was wile and guile) and the damned hag asked, \"Where be the King of the Age, Zau al-Makan, and the Minister Dandan?\" Answered he, \"Here am I!\" Take with thee thy Wazir,\" said she, \"and follow after me, that we may fare forth to Constantinople.\" Now she had acquainted the Infidels with the cheat she had put upon the Moslems, and they rejoiced with exceeding great joy, and said, Our hearts will not be contented till we shall have slain their King in return for the Knight's death; because we had no stouter rider than he;\" and they added (bespeaking the ill omened hag as she told them her plan of faring to the land of the Moslems), \"When thou bringest him to us, we will bear him to King Afridun.\" Then she went out and went out with her Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan, and she walked on before the two saying, \"Fare forth with the blessing of Almighty Allah!\" So they did her bidding, for the shaft of Pate and Fortune of man's lot had shot them, and she ceased not leading them both through the midst of the Grecian camp, till they came to the defile, the narrow pass aforesaid, whilst the Infidel enemy watched them, but did them no hindrance; for the infernal old woman had enjoined this. Now when Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan saw that the Infidel host offered them no let and stay and yet had them in sight, the Wazir exclaimed, \"By Allah, this is one of the holy man's saintly miracles! and doubtless he be of the elect.\" Rejoined Zau al-Makan, \"By Allah, I think the Infidels be naught but blind, for we see them and they see us not.\" And while they were thus praising the holy man and recounting his mighty works and his piety and his prayers, behold, the Infidels charged down on them from all sides and surrounded them and seized them, saying, \"Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him too?\" And the Wazir Dandan replied, \"See you not yon other man that is before us? ' Replied the Unbelievers, \"By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks, and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!\" Then Zau Al-Makan said, \"By Allah, this is a chastisement decreed to us by Almighty Allah!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Unfaithful had seized upon King Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan, they said to the two, \"Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him also?\" And the Wazir Dandan replied, \"See you not yon other man who be with us?\" They rejoined, \"By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!\" Then the Infidels laid shackles on their feet and set men to guard them during the night, whilst Zat al-Dawahi fared on and disappeared from their sight. So they fell to lamenting and saying to each other, \"Verily, the opposing of pious men leadeth to greater distress than this, and we are punished by the strait which hath befallen us.\" So far concerning Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan; but as regards King Sharrkan, he passed that night in the cavern with his comrades, and when dawned the day and he had prayed the morn prayer, he and his men made ready to do battle with the Infidel and he heartened them and promised them all good. Then they sallied out till they were hard upon the Unbelievers and, when these saw them from afar, they cried out to them, saying, \"O Moslems, we have taken captives your Sultan and your Wazir who hath the ordering of your affairs; and except ye leave off fighting us, we will slay you to the last man; but an you yield yourselves we will take you to our King, who will make peace with you on condition that you quit our country and return home and harm us in naught, and we will do you no harm in aught. If ye accept, it will be well for you; but if ye refuse there remaineth nothing for you but death. So we have told you sooth, and this is our last word to you.\" Now when Sharrkan heard this and was certified of the captivity of his brother and the Wazir Dandan, he was weighed down with woe and wept; his force failed him and, making sure of death, he said to himself, \"Would I knew the cause of their capture! Did they fail of respect to the holy man or disobey him, or what was the matter?\" Then they sprang up to battle with the Unbelievers and slew great numbers of them. The brave was known that day from craven men, and sword and spear were dyed with bloody stain; for the Infidels flocked up on them, as flies flock to drink, from hill and from plain; but Sharrkan and his men ceased not to wage the fight of those who fear not to die, nor let death hinder them from the pursuit of victory, till the valley ran gore and earth was full of the slain she bore. And when night fell the armies separated each making for his own place; and the Moslems returned to the cavern where gain and loss were manifest to them: few remained of them and there was no dependence for them but on Allah and the scymitar. Now there had been slain of them that day five and thirty men of the chiefest Emirs, and they had killed thousands of the Infidels, footmen and fighters on horse. When Sharrkan saw this, the case was grievous to him and he asked his comrades \"What shall we do?\"; whereto all answered, \"That which Almighty Allah willeth shall befal us.\" On the morning of the second day, Sharrkan said to the remnant of his troop, \"If ye go forth to fight, not one of you will remain alive and we have but little left of food and water; so I deem ye would do better to bare your brands and go forth and stand at the mouth of this cavern, to hinder any from entering. Haply the holy man may have reached the Moslem host, and may return with ten thousand horses to succour us in fight with the Infidels, for belike the Unfaithful may have failed to see him and those with him.\" They said, This were the better course to take, and of its expediency no doubt we make.\" So the troop went out and held the cavern mouth standing by its walls; and every one of the Infidels who sought to enter in, they slew. Thus did they fend off the foe from the gape of the cave and they patiently supported all such assaults, till day was done and night came on dusky and dun;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the army of the Moslems held the cavern mouth and stood by its walls and they fended off the foe, and every one of the Infidels attempted to charge them, him they slew; and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dun, by which time King Sharrkan had only five and twenty men and no more left. Then quoth the Infidels to one another, \"When shall these battle days have an end? We are weary of warring the Moslems.\" And quoth one of them, \"Up and at them, for there remain of them but five and twenty men! If we cannot prevail on them to fight, let us light a fire upon them;[FN#433] and if they submit themselves and yield to us, we will take them prisoners; but if they refuse we will leave them for fuel to the fire, so shall they become to men of foreseeing mind a warning dire. May the Messiah on their fathers have no grace, and may the sojourn of the Nazarenes be for them no abiding place!\" So they carried fuel to the jaws of the cavern and set fire to it. Thereupon Sharrkan and his companions made sure of perdition and yielded themselves prisoners. And while they were in this condition, lo! the knight their captain said to those who counselled their slaughter, \"It is not for any save for King Afridun to kill them, that he may gratify his wrath; therefore it behoveth us to keep them in durance by us till the morrow, when we will journey with them to Constantinople and deliver them to our King, who shall deal with them as he please.\" Said they, \"This is the right course;\" and he commanded to pinion them and set guards over them. Then, as soon as it was black night, the Infidels busied themselves with feasting and making festival; and they called for wine and drank it till all fell upon their backs. Now Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan, were in confinement and so also were his companion knights; whereupon the elder turned to the younger brother and said to him, \"O my brother, how win free?\" \"By Allah,\" replied Zau al Makan, \"I know not; for here we be like birds in cage.\" Then Sharrkan waxed wroth and sighed for excess of rage and stretched himself, till his pinion bonds brass asunder; whereupon being free he arose and went up to the Captain of the guard, and taking from his pocket the keys of the fetters, freed Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the rest of his men. Then he turned to the two and said, \"I desire to slay three of these Infidels and take and don their dress, we three; so that we shall be guised as Greeks and we will pass through them, with out their knowing us, and fare forth to our own force.\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"This is no safe counsel for if we kill them, I fear some of their comrades may hear their shrieks and the foe be aroused upon us and kill us. 'Twere the surer way to pass out of the defile.\" So they agreed upon this and set out; and, when they had left the head of the strait a little distance behind, they saw horses picketed and the riders sleeping: and Sharrkan said to his brother, \"Better we take each one of us a steed.\" There were five and twenty horsemen, so they took five and twenty horses, whilst Allah sent sleep upon the Infidels for a purpose He knew and the Faithful mounted and fared on till they were out of reach. Meanwhile Sharrkan set to gathering from the Infidels as many weapons, swords, and spears, as were wanted. And while they took saddle and struck forwards none of the Infidels supposed that anyone could release Zau al-Makan and his brother and their men; or that their prisoners had power to escape. Now when all the captives were safe from the Unfaithful, Sharrkan came up with his comrades, and found them awaiting his arrival, on coals of flame, expecting him in anxious grame, so he turned to them and said, \"Feel no fear since Allah protecteth us. I have that to propose which haply shall effect our purpose.\" \"What is it?\" asked they and he answered, \"I desire that ye all climb to the mountain top and cry out with one voice, 'Allaho Akbar!' and ye add, 'The army of Al Islam is upon you! Allaho Akbar!' This wise their company will surely be dissolved nor will they find out the trick for they are drunk, but they will think that the Moslem troops have encompassed them about on all sides and have mingled with them; so they will fall on one another brand in hand during the confusion of drunkenness and sleep, and we will cleave them asunder with their own swords and the scymitar will go round amongst them till dawn.\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"This plan is not good; we should do better to make our way to our army and speak not a word; for if we cry out 'Allaho Akbar,' they will wake and fall on us and not one of us will escape.\" Rejoined Sharrkan, \"By Allah, though they should awake tis no matter, and I long that ye fall in with my plan, for naught save good can come of it!\" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain and shouted, \"Allaho Akbar!\" And hills and trees and rocks reworded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. But when the Kafirs heard this slogan they cried out to one another,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundredth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan spake thus, \"I long that ye fall in with this my plan, for naught save good can come of it.\" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain head and shouted, \"Allaho Akbar!\"; and hills and trees and rocks re worded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. The Infidels heard it and cried out one to other and donned their armour and said, \"The foe is upon us, by the truth of the Messiah!\" Then they fell on one another and slew of their own men more than any knoweth save Almighty Allah. As soon as it was dawn, they sought for the captives, but found no trace of them, and their captains said, \"They who did this were the prisoners in our possession; up, then, and after them in all haste till ye overtake them, when we will make them quaff the cup of requital; and let not fright nor the panic of sudden awaking possess you.\" So they took horse and rode after the fugitives and it wanted but an eye twinkling before they overtook them and surrounded them. Now when Zau al-Makan saw this, he was seized with increase of terror and said to his brother, \"What I feared would come, is come upon us, and now it remaineth only for us to fight for the Faith.\" But Sharrkan preferred to hold his peace. Then Zau al- Makan and his companions rushed down from the hill crest, shouting, \"Allaho Akbar!\" and his men repeated the war cry and addressed themselves to fight and to sell their lives in the service of the Lord of Faithful Men; and while they were in this case, behold, they heard many voices voicing, \"There is no god but the God! God is most great! Salutation and salvation upon the Apostle, the Bringer of glad Tidings, the Bearer of bad Tidings!''[FN#434] So they turned towards the direction of the sound and saw a company of Moslems who believed in one God, pushing towards them, whereat their hearts were heartened and Sharrkan charged upon the Infidels crying out, \"There is no god but the God! God is most great! he and those with him, so that earth quaked as with an earthquake and the Unbeliever host brake asunder and fled into the mountains and the Moslems followed them with lunge and blow; and Zau al-Makan and his comrades of the Moslems ceased not to smite the hosts of the Infidel foe, and parted heads from bodies till day darkened and night coming on starkened sight. Thereupon the Moslems drew together and passed the night in congratulations, and, when morning dawned and daybreak shone with its shine and sheen, they saw Bahram, the captain of the Daylamites, and Rustam, the captain of the Turks, advancing to join them, with twenty thousand cavaliers like lions grim. As soon as they saw Zau al-Makan, the riders dismounted and saluted him, and kissed ground between his hands when he said to them, \"Rejoice ye in the glad tidings of the victory of the Moslem and the discomfiture of the tribe of Unbelievers!\" Then they gave one another joy of their deliverance and of the greatness of their reward after Resurrection Day. Now the cause of the coming of the succours to that place was this. When the Emir Bahram and the Emir Rustam and the Chief Chamberlain, with the Moslem host and flags flaunting high ahead, came in sight of Constantinople they saw that the Nazarenes had mounted the walls and manned the towers and the forts, and had set all their defenders in order of defence, as soon as they learned of the approach of the host of Al-Islam and the banners Mohammedan, and they heard the clash of arms and the noise of war voices and tramp of horse hoofs and from their look outs they beheld the Moslems, with their standards and ensigns of the Faith of Unity under the dust clouds and lo! they were like a flight of locusts or rain clouds raining rain, and the voices of the Moslems chanting the Koran and glorifying the Compassionate One, struck their ears. Now the Infidels knew of the approach of this host through Zat al-Dawahi with her craft and whoredom,[FN#435] calumny and contrivance. And the armies of Al-Islam drew near, as it were the swollen sea, for the multitude of footmen and horsemen and women and children. Then quoth the General of the Turks to the General of the Daylamites, \"O Emir, of a truth, we are in jeopardy from the multitude of the foe who is on the walls. Look at yonder bulwarks and at this world of folk like the seas that clash with dashing billows. Indeed yon Infidel outnumbereth us an hundredfold and we cannot be safe from spies who may inform them that we are without a Sultan. In very sooth, we run danger from these enemies, whose numbers may not be told and whose resources none can withhold, especially in the absence of King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the illustrious Wazir Dandan. If they know of this, they will be emboldened to attack us in their absence and with the sword they will annihilate us to the last man; not one of us safety shall see. So it is my counsel that thou take ten thousand riders of the allies and the Turks, and march them to the hermitage of Matruhina and the meadow of Mal\u00fakhin\u00e1 in quest of our brothers and comrades. If thou act by my advice, it may be we shall approve ourselves the cause of their deliverance, in case they be hard pressed by the Infidels; and if thou act not, blame will not attach to me. But, an ye go, it behoveth that ye return quickly, for ill suspicion is part of prudence.\" The Emir aforesaid fell in with his counsel; so they chose twenty thousand horse and they set out covering the roads and making for the monastery above mentioned. So much for the cause of their coming; but as regards the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, as soon as she had delivered Sultan Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan into the hands of the Infidels, the foul whore mounted a swift steed, saying to the Faithless, \"I design to rejoin the Moslem army which is at Constantinople and contrive for their destruction; for I will inform them that their chiefs are dead, and when they hear that from me, their joining will be disjointed and the cord of their confederation cut and their host scattered. Then will I go to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, and to my son Hardub, King of Roum, and relate to them their tidings and they will sally forth on the Moslems with their troops and will destroy them and will not leave one of them alive.\" So she mounted and struck across country on her good steed all the livelong night; and, when day dawned, appeared the armies of Bahram and Rustam advancing towards her. So she turned into a wayside brake and hid her horse among the trees and she walked a while saying to herself, \"Haply the Moslem hosts be returning, routed, from the assault of Constantinople.\" However, as she drew near them she looked narrowly and made sure that their standards were not reversed,[FN#436] and she knew that they were coming not as conquered men, but fearing for their King and comrades. When she was assured of this, she hastened towards them, running at speed, like a devil of ill rede, till reaching them she cried out, \"Haste ye! haste ye! O soldiers of the Compassionate One, hasten to the Holy War against the hosts of Satan!\" When Bahram saw her he dismounted and kissed the ground before her and asked her, \"O friend of Allah what is behind thee?\" Answered she, \"Question not of sad case and sore condition; for when our comrades had taken the treasure from the hermitage of Matruhina, and designed to win their way Constantinople wards, thereupon came out on them a driving host and a dreadful of the Infidels.\" And the damned witch repeated to them the story to fill them with trouble and terror, adding, \"The most of them are dead, and there are but five and twenty men left.\" Said Bahram, \"O holy man! when didst thou leave them?\" \"But this night,\"[FN#437] replied she. He cried, \"Glory be to Allah! to Him who hath rolled up the far distance for thee like a rug, so that thou hast sped thus walking upon thy feet and props upon a mid-rib of palm-tree! But thou art one of the saints which fly like birds when inspired and possessed by His directions.\"[FN#438] Then he mounted his horse, and he was perplexed and confounded by what he had heard from the beldam so strong in lies and ill calumnies, and he said, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily our labour is lost and our hearts are heavy within us, for our Sultan is a prisoner and those who are with him.\" Then they cut across the country, wide and side, night and day, and when morning dawned they reached the head of the defile and saw Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan shouting. \"There is no god but the God! Allaho Akbar! and Salutation and Salvation upon the Congratulator, the Comminator.\"[FN#439] Whereupon he and his drove at the Unbelievers and whelmed them, as the rain torrent whelms the waste; and cried out their war cries, till fear get hold of the prowess Knights and the mountains were cloven in affright. And when shone the day and showed its shine and sheen, the breeze of morning blew upon them sweet and fragrant, and each recognised other as hath been said before. Then they kissed the ground before the King and before his brother Sharrkan, who told them all that had befallen the party in the cave. Now thereat they marvelled and said to one another, \"Hasten we back to Constantinople, for we left our companions there, and our hearts are with them.\" So they hurried departure, commending themselves to the Subtle, the All-wise, and Zau al-Makan exhorted the Moslems to steadfast- ness and versified in the following couplets,[FN#440]\n\n\"Be praises mine to all praiseworthy Thee, * O Lord, who stinted\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    not mine aid to be!\nThough was I lost abroad, Thou west to me * Strongest support\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    which vouchsafed victory:\nThou gav'st me wealth and reign and goodly gifts, * And slungest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    con quering sword of valiancy:\nThou mad'st me blest beneath Thy kingly shade, * Engraced with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    generous boons dealt fain and free:\nThou savedst *from every fear I feared, by aid * Of my Wazir, the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Age's noblest he!\nGarred us Thy grace in fight to throw the Greek, * Who yet came\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     back dight in War's cramoisie:\nThen made I feint to fly from out the fight; * But like grim lion\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   turning made them flee,\nAnd left on valley sole my foemen, drunk * Not with old\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   wine[FN#441] but Death-cup's revelry:\nThen came the Saintly Hermit, and he showed * His marvels wrought\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    for town and wold to see;\nWhen slew they hero-wights who woke to dwell * In Eden bowers\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   wherein sweet rill-lets well.\"\n\nBut, when Zau al-Makan had made an end of versifying, his brother Sharrkan congratulated him on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and First Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan congratulated his brother, Zau al-Makan, on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army. Such was their case; but as regards the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, after she had foregathered with the hosts of Rustam and Bahram, she returned to the coppice, where she took her steed and mounted and sped on at speed, till she drew near the Moslem army that beleaguered Constantinople, when she lighted down from her destrier and led it to the pavilion tent of the Chief Chamberlain. And when he saw her, he stood up to her in honour and signed to her with his right hand and said, \"Welcome O pious recluse!\" Then he questioned her of what had befallen, and she repeated to him her disquieting lies and deluding calumnies, saying, \"In sooth I fear for the Emir Rustam, and the Emir Bahram, for that I met them and theirs on the way and sent them and their following to relieve the King and his companions. Now there are but twenty thousand horse and the Unbelievers outnumber them; so I would have thee at this moment send off the rest of thy troops at full speed to their suc cour, lest they be slain to the last man.\" And she cried to them, \"Haste! Haste!\" When the Chamberlain and the Moslems heard these words, their spirits fell and they wept; but Zat al-Dawahi said to them, \"Ask aidance of Allah and bear patiently this triburation; for ye have the example of those who have been before you of the people of Mohammed; and Paradise with its palaces is laid out by Allah for those who die martyrs; and needs must all die, but most praiseworthy is dying while fighting for the Faith.\" The Chamberlain, hearing this speech of the accursed old woman, called for the Emir Bahram's brother, a knight by name Tarkash; and, choosing out for him ten thousand horse, riders famed for force, bade him set out at once. So he fared forth and marched all that day and the whole of the next night, till he neared the Moslems. When daylight dawned, Sharrkan saw the dust cloud about them and feared for the men of Al-Islam and said, \"If these troops which are coming upon us be Moslem men our victory is assured by them; but, if these be Nazarenes, there is no gainsaying Destiny's decrees.\" Then he turned to his brother, Zau al- Makan, and said, Never fear, for with my life I will ransom thee from death. If these be Mohammedan troops, then were it an increase of heavenly favours; but, if they be our foes, there is no help save that we fight them. Yet do I long to meet the Holy Man ere I die, so I may beg him to pray that I die not save by death of martyrdom.\" Whilst the twain were thus speaking, behold, there appeared the banners inscribed with the words, \"There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God;\" and Sharrkan cried out, \"How is it with the Moslems?\" \"All are sound and safe,\" replied they, \"and we came not but out of concern for you.\" Then the Chief of the army dismounted and, kissing ground before Sharrkan, asked, \"O my lord, how be the Sultan and the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and my brother Bahram; are they all in safety?\" He answered, \"All well; but who brought thee tidings of us?\" Quoth Tarkash; \"It was the Holy Man who told us that he had met my brother Bahram and Rustam and had sent them both to you and he also assured us that the Infidels had encompassed you and out numbered you; but I see not the case save the contrary thereof and that you are victorious.\" They questioned him, \"And how did the Holy Man reach you?\"; and he replied, \"Walking on his feet and he had compassed in a day and a night, ten days' journey for a well girt horseman.\" \"There is no doubt but that he is a Saint of Allah,\" said Sharrkan, \"but where is he now?\" They rejoined, \"We left him with our troops, the folk of the Faith, moving them to do battle with the rebels and the Faithless.\" Thereat Sharrkan rejoiced and all thanked Allah for their own deliverance and the safety of the Holy Man; and commended the dead to His mercy saying, \"This was writ in the Book.\" Then they set out making for Constantinople by forced marches, and whilst they were on this enterprise, behold, a dust cloud arose to such height that it walled the two horizons, the eastern and the western, from man's sight and the day was darkened by it to night. But Sharrkan looked at it and said, \"Verily, I fear lest this be the Infidels who have routed the army of Al-Islam for that this dust walleth the world, east and west, and hideth the two horizons, north and south.\" Presently appeared under the dust a pillar of darkness, blacker than the blackness of dismal days; nor ceased to come upon them that column more dreadful than the dread of the Day of Doom. Horse and foot hastened up to look at it and know the terrors of the case, when behold, they saw it to be the recluse aforesaid; so they thronged round him to kiss his hands and he cried out, \"O people of the Best of Mankind,[FN#442] the lamp which shineth in darkness blind, verily the Infidels have outwitted the Moslems by guile, for they fell upon the host of the One God whilst they deemed themselves safe from the Faithless, and attacked them in their tents and made a sore slaughter of them what while they looked for no wile; so hasten to the aid of the Believers in the unity of God, and deliver them from those who deny Him!\" Now when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart flew from his breast with sore trouble; and, alighting from his steed in amazement, he kissed the Recluse's hands and feet. On like wise did his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the rest of the foot and horse troops; except the Wazir Dandan, who dismounted not but said, \"By Allah, my heart flieth from this devotee, for I never knew show of devotion to religion that bred not bane. So leave him and rejoin your comrades the Moslems, for this man is of the outcasts from the gate of the mercy of the Lord of the Three Worlds! How often have I here made razzias with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and trodden the earth of these lands!\" Said Sharrkan, \"Put away from thee such evil thought, hast thou not seen this Holy Man exciting the Faithful to fight, and holding spears and swords light? So slander him not, for backbiting is blameable and poisoned is the flesh of the pious.[FN#443] Look how he inciteth us to fight the foe; and, did not Almighty Allah love him, He had cast him aforetime into fearful torment.\" Then Sharrkan bade bring a Nubian mule for the ascetic to ride and said, \"Mount, O pious man, devout and virtuous!\" But the devotee refused to ride and feigned self denial, that he might attain his end; and they knew not that this holy personage was like him of whom the poet saith,\n\n\"He prayeth and he fasteth for an end he doth espy; * When once his end is safely won then fast and prayer good bye.\"[FN#444]\n\nSo the devotee ceased not to walk among the horsemen and the footmen, like a wily fox meditating guile, and began to uplift her voice, chanting the Koran and praising the Compassionate One. And they continued pressing forward till they approached the camp of Al-Islam, where Sharrkan found the Moslem in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of falling back in flight, whilst the sword of Greece havoc dight among the Faithful, the righteous and those who work upright,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan saw the Moslems in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of retreat and flight and the sword havoc dight among the righteous and the workers of upright, the cause of this weakness among the Moslems was that the accursed old woman, Zat al- Dawahi, the foe of the Faith, after seeing that Bahram and Rustam had set forward with their troops to join Sharrkan and his brother Zau al-Makan, repaired to the camp of the Mahometans before Constantinople and caused the mission of the Emir Tarkash, as hath been before said. In this her purpose was to divide the Moslem forces the better to weaken them. Then she left them and entered Constantinople, and called with a loud voice on the knights of the Greeks, saying, \"Let me down a cord that I may tie thereto this letter, and do ye bear it to your King Afridun, that he may read it and to my son King Hardub that they both do what is written therein of bidding and forbidding.\" So they let down for her a string and she tied thereto a letter whose purport was the following: \"From the terriblest of tribulations[FN#445] and the chiefest of all calamities, Zat al-Dawahi, to King Afridun greeting. But afterwards, of a truth I have contrived a device for destroying the Moslems; so bide ye quiet and content. I have cozened and captured their Sultan and the Wazir Dandan; and then I returned to their camp and acquainted them therewith, whereby their pride had a fall and their withers were wrung. And I have so wrought upon the host 'leaguering Constantinople that they have sent ten thousand men under the Emir Tarkash to succour the capitves, of whom there be now left but few; it is therefore my object that ye sally forth against them with all your power while this day endureth; and that ye fall on them in their tents and that ye leave them not till ye shall have slain them to the last man; for, verily the Messiah looketh down upon you and the Blessed Virgin favoureth you; and I hope of the Messiah that he forget not what deed I have done.\" When her letter came to King Afridun, he rejoiced with great joyance; and, sending at once for King Hardub of Greece, son of Zat al-Dawahi, read the letter to him as soon as he came,whereathe was exceeding glad and said, \"See my mother's craft; verily it dispenseth with swords, and her aspect standeth in stead of the terrors of the Day of Dread.\" Rejoined Afridun, \"May the Messiah not bereave us of thy venerable parent nor deprive her of her wile and guile!\" Then he bade the Knights give orders for sallying outside the city, and the news was noised abroad in Constantinople. So the Nazarenes and the cohorts of the Cross burst forth and unsheathed their keen sabres in their numbers, shouting out their professions of impiety and heresies, and blaspheming the Lord of all Creatures. When the Chamberlain saw the sally, he said, \"Behold, the Greek is upon us and they surely have learned that our Sultan is far away; and haply they have attacked us, for that the most part of our troops have marched to the succour of King Zau al-Makan!\" Therewith he waxed wroth and cried out, \"Ho, soldiers of Al-Islam and favourers of the True Faith, an you flee you are lost, but if ye stand fast, ye win! Know ye that valiancy lieth in endurance of outrance and that no case is so strait but that the Almighty is able to make it straight; Allah assain you and look upon you with eyes of compassion fain!\" Thereupon the Moslems cried out, \"Allaho Akbar!\" and the believer in the One God shouted his slogan, and whirled the mill wheels of fight with cutting and thrusting in main and might; scymitars and spears played sore and the plains and valleys were swamped with gore. The priests and monks priested it, tight girding their girdles and uplifting the Crucifixes, while the Moslem shouted out the professions of the Requiting King and verses of the Koran began to sing. The hosts of the Compassion are One fought against the legions of Satan; and head flew from body of man, while the good Angels hovered above the people of the Chosen Prophet, nor did the sword cease to smite till the day darkened and night came on and starkened. Now the miscreants had encompassed the Moslems and made sure of escaping the pains that awaited them; and the Faithless greeded for victory over the Faithful until day dawned and dazzled. There upon the Chamberlain mounted, he and his men, trusting thee Allah would help them to victory; and host was mingled with host and battle rose a foot and took post. And heads flew from trunks whilst the brave stood fast in stead; the craven turned tail and fled; and the Judge of death judged and sentence sped, so that the champions fell from their saddles slain and corpses cumbered meadow and plain. Then the Moslem began to give ground and rearwards bent; and the Greek took possession of some of their tents; whereupon the Moslems were about to break and retreat and take flight, when meanwhile behold, up came Sharrkan with the rest of the host of Al-Islam and the standards of the Believers in Unity. And having come up with them, he charged the Infidels; and followed him Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Emirs Bahram and Rustam with his brother Tarkash. When the foe saw this, they lost head and their reason fled, and the dust clouds towered till they covered the country whilst the righteous Believers joined their pious comrades. Then Sharrkan accosted the Chamberlain and praised him for his steadfastness; and he in turn gave the Prince joy of his timely succour and his gaining the day. Thereat the Moslems were glad and their hearts were heartened; so they rushed upon their enemies and devoted themselves to Allah in their Fight for the Faith. But when the Idolaters beheld the standards Mohammedan and there on the profession of Faith Islamitan, proclaiming the Unity, they shrieked \"Woe!\" and \"Ruin!\" and besought succour of the Patriarchs of the Monasteries. Then fell they to calling upon John and Mary and the Cross abhorrent and stayed their hands from slaughter, whilst King Afridun went up to consult King Hardub of Greece, for the two Kings stood one at the head of each wing, right and left. Now there was with them also a famous cavalier, Lawiya highs, who commanded the centre; and they drew out in battle array, but indeed they were full of alarm and affray. Meanwhile, the Moslems aligned their forces and thereupon Sharrkan came to his brother, Zau al-Makan, and said, \"O King of the Age, doubtless they mean to champion it, and that is also the object of our desire; but it is my wish to push forward the stoutest hearted of our fighters, for by forethought is one half of life wrought.\" Replied the Sultan, \"As thou wilt, O companion of good counsel!\" \"It is my wish,\" added Sharrkan, \"to stand in mid line opposite the Infidel, with the Wazir Dandan on my left and thee on my right, whilst the Emir Bahram leads the dexter wing and the Emir Rustam leads the wing sinistral; and thou, O mighty King, shalt be under the standards and the ensigns, for that thou art the pillar of our defence; upon thee, after Allah, is our dependence and we will all be thy ransom from aught that can harm thee.\" Zau al-Makan thanked him therefor, and the slogan arose and the sabre was drawn; but, as things stood thus, behold, there came forth a cavalier from the ranks of Roum; and, as he drew near, they saw that he was mounted on a slow paced she mule, fleeing with her master from the shock of swords. Her housings were of white silk covered by a prayer-carpet of Cash mere stuff, and on her back sat a Shaykh, an old man of comely presence and reverend aspect, garbed in a gown of white wool. He stinted not pushing her and hurrying her on till he came near the Moslem and said, \"I am an ambassador to you all, and an ambassador hath naught to do save to deliver; so give me safe conduct and permit of speech, that I communicate to you my message.\" Replied Sharrkan, \"Thou art in safety: fear neither sway of sword nor lunge of lance.\" Thereupon the old man dismounted and, taking the Cross from his neck, placed it before the Sultan and humbled himself with much humility. Then quoth to him the Moslems, \"What is with thee of news?\"; and quoth he, \"I am an ambassador from King Afridun, for I counselled him to avert the destruction of all these frames of men and temples of the Compassionate One; and to him it seemed righteous to stay the shedding of blood and limit it to the encounter of two knights in shock of fight singular; so he agreed to that and he saith to you, 'Verily, I will ransom my army with my life; so let the Moslem King do as I do and with his life ransom his host. And if he kill me, there will be no stay left in the army of Roum, and if I kill him, there will be no stability with the Moslems.\" When Sharrkan heard this he said, \"O monk, I agree to that, for it is just nor may it be gainsaid; and behold, I will meet him in duello and do with him derring do, for I am Champion of the Faithful even as he is Champion of the Faithless; and if he slay me, he will have won the day and naught will remain for the Moslems forces save flight. So return to him, O thou monk, and say that the single combat shall take place to morrow, for this day we have come off our journey and are aweary; but after rest neither reproach nor blame fear ye.\" So the monk returned (and he rejoicing) to King Afridun and King Hardub, and told them both what Sharrkan had said, whereat King Afridun was glad with exceeding gladness and fell from him anxiety and sadness, and he said to himself, \"No doubt but this Sharrkan is their doughtiest swayer of the sword and the dourest at lunge of lance; and when I shall have slain him, their hearts will be disheartened and their strength will be shattered.\" Now Zat al-Dawahi had written to King Afridun of that and had told him how Sharrkan was a Knight of the Braves and the bravest of knights and had warned him against him; but Afridun was a stalwart cavalier who fought in many a fashion; he could hurl rocks and throw spears and smite with the iron mace and he feared not the prowess of the prow. So when he heard the report of the monk that Sharrkan agreed to the duello, he was like to fly for exceeding joy because he had self confidence and he knew that none could with stand him. The Infidels passed that night in joy and jubilee and wine bibbing; and, as soon as it was dawn, the two armies drew out with the swart of spear and the blanch of blade. And behold a cavalier rode single handed into the plain, mounted on a steed of purest strain, and for foray and fray full ready and fain. And that Knight had limbs of might and he was clad in an iron cuirass made for stress of fight. On his breast he wore a jewelled mirror and in his hand he bore a keen scymitar and his lance of Khalanj wood,[FN#446] the curious work of the Frank, weighing a quintal. Then the rider uncovered his face and cried out, saying, \"Whoso knoweth me verily hath enough of me, and whoso knoweth me not right soon[FN#447] shall ken who I be. I am Afridun the overwhelmed by the well omened Shaw\u00e1hi,[FN#448] Zat al-Dawahi.\" But he had not ended speaking ere Sharrkan, the Champion of the Moslems, fared forth to meet him, mounted on a sorrel horse worth a thousand pieces of red gold with accoutrements purfled in pearls and precious stone; and he bore in baldrick a blade of watered Indian steel that through necks shore and made easy the hard and sore. He crave his charger between the two hosts in line whilst the horsemen all fixed on him their eyne, and he cried out to Afridun, \"Woe to thee, O accursed! dost thou deem me one of the horsemen thou hast overta'en who cannot stand against thee on battle plain?\" Then each rushed upon other and they bashed together like two mountains crashing or two billows dash ing and clashing: they advanced and retreated; and drew together and withdrew; and stinted not of fray and fight and weapon play, and strife and stay, with stroke of sword and lunge of lance. Of the two armies looking on, some said, \"Sharrkan is victor!\" and others, \"Afridun will conquer!\"; and the two riders stayed not their hands from the hustle until ceased the clamour and the bustle; and the dust columns rose and the day waned and the sun waxed yellow and wan. Then cried out King Afridun to Sharrkan, saying, \"By the truth of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, thou art nought save a doughty rider and a stalwart fighter; but thou art fraudful and thy nature is not that of the noble. I ken thy work is other than praiseworthy nor is thy prowess that of a Prince; for thy people behave to thee as though thou wert a slave;[FN#449] and see! they bring thee out a charger which is not thine, that thou mayst mount and return to the fight. But by the truth of my Faith, thy fighting irketh and fatigueth me and I am weary of cutting and thrusting with thee; and if thou purpose to lay on load with me to night, thou wouldst not change aught of thy harness nor thy horse, till thou approve to the cavaliers, thy generous blood and skill in brunt.\" When Sharrkan heard him say these words concerning his own folk behaving to him though he were a slave, he waxt wroth and turned towards his men, meaning to sign to them and bid them not prepare him change of harness or horse, when lo! Afridun shook his throw spear high in air and cast it at Sharrkan. Now when the Moslem turned his back, he found none of the men near him, and he knew this to be a trick of the accursed Infidel; so he wheeled round in haste and behold, the javelin came at him, so he swerved from it, till his head was bent low as his saddle bow. The weapon grazed his breast, and pierced the skin of his chest, for Sharrkan was high bosomed: whereupon he gave one cry and swooned away. Thereat the accursed Afridun was joyful, thinking he had slain him; and shouted to the Infidels bidding them rejoice, whereat the Faithless were encouraged and the Faithful wept. When Zau al-Makan saw his brother reeling in selle so that he well nigh fell, he despatched cavaliers towards him and the braves hurried to his aid and came up with him. Thereupon the Infidels drove at the Moslems; the two hosts joined battle and the two lines were mingled, whilst the keen scymitar of Al-Yaman did good work. Now the first to reach Sharrkan was the Wazir Dandan,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau al-Makan saw that the accursed Infidel had struck with javelin his brother Sharrkan, he deemed him dead, and despatched cavaliers towards him; and the first to reach him were the Wazir Dandan and the Emir of the Turks, Bahram, and the Emir of the Daylamites, Rustam. They found him falling from his horse; so they stayed him in his saddle and returned with him to his brother, Zau al-Makan; then they gave him in charge to his pages, and went again to do the work of cut and thrust. So the strife redoubled and the weapons together clashed and ceased not bate and debate and naught was to be seen but blood flowing and necks bowing; nor did the swords cease on the napes of men to make play nor the strife to rage with more and more affray, till the most part of the night was past away and the two hosts were aweary of the mellay. So they called a truce and each army returned to its tents, whilst all the Infidels repaired to King Afridun and kissed the ground before him, and the priests and monks wished him joy of his victory over Sharrkan. Then the King fared for Constantinople and sat upon the throne of his realm, when King Hardub came to him and said, \"May the Messiah strengthen thy fore arm and never cease to be thy helper and hearken to what prayers my pious mother, Zat al-Dawahi, shall pray for thee! Know that the Moslems can make no stay without Sharrkan.\" Replied Afridun, \"To morrow shall end the affair when to fight I fare: I will seek Zau al-Makan and slay him, and their army shall turn tail and of flight shall avail.\" Such was the case with the Kafirs; but as regards the host of Al-Islam, when Zau al-Makan returned to his tent, he thought of naught but his brother and, going into the pavilion, found him in evil case and sore condition; whereupon he summoned for counsel the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and Bahram. When they entered, they opined to assemble the physicians that they might medicine Sharrkan, and they wept and said, \"The world will not readily afford his like!\" and they watched by him all that night, and about the later hours came to them the Recluse in tears. When Zau al-Makan saw him, he rose in honour; and the Religious stroked Sharrkan's wound with his hand, chanting somewhat of the Koran and repeating by way of talisman some of the verses of the Compassionate One. And the pretender ceased not to watch over him till dawn, when he came to himself and, opening his eyes, moved his tongue in his mouth and spake. At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, saying, \"Of a truth the blessing of the Holy Man hath taken effect on him!\" And Sharrkan said, \"Praised be Allah for recovery; indeed, I am well at this hour. That accursed one played me false; and, but that I swerved aside lighter than lightening, the throw spear had pierced through my breast. So praised be Allah for saving me! And how is it with the Moslems?\" Answered Zau al-Makan, \"All are weeping for thee.\" Quoth Sharrkan, \"I am well and in good case; but where is the Holy Man?\" Now he was sitting by him and said, \"At thy head.\" So the Prince turned to him and kissed his hand when he said, \"O my son! Be of good patience and Allah shall increase thy reward; for the wage is measured by the work.\" Sharrkan rejoined, \"Pray for me,\" and he prayed for him. As soon as morning dawned and day brake in shine and sheen, the Moslems sallied out to the plain and the Kafirs made ready to thrust and cut. Then the Islamite host advanced and offered fight with weapons ready dight, and King Zau al-Makan and Afridun made to charge one at other. But when Zau al-Makan fared forth into the field, there came with him the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Bahram, saying, \"We will be thy sacrifice.\" He replied, \"By the Holy House and Zemzem and the Place![FN#450] I will not be stayed from going forth against these wild asses.\" And when he rode out into the field he played with sword and spear till riders marvelled and both armies wondered; then he rushed upon the foe's right wing and of it slew two knights and in like manner he dealt with the left wing. Presently he stayed his steed in the midst of the field and cried out, \"Where is Afridun, that I may make him taste the cup of disgrace?\" But when King Hardub saw the case he conjured Afridun not to attack him, saying, \"O King, yesterday it was thy turn to fight: it is mine to day. I care naught for his prowess.\" So he rushed out towards Zau al-Makan brand in hand and under him a stallion like Abjar, which was Antar's charger and its coat was jet black even as saith the poet,\n\n\"On the glancing racer outracing glance * He speeds, as though he\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    would collar Doom:\nHis steed's black coat is of darkest jet, * And likest Night in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    her nightliest gloom:\nWhose neigh sounds glad to the hearer's ears * Like thunders\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     rolling in thun d'rous boom:\nIf he race the wind he will lead the way, * And the lightning\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     flash will behind him loom.''[FN#451]\n\nThen each rushed upon the opponent, parrying blows and proving the marvellous qualities were stored in him; and they fell to drawing on and withdrawing till the breasts of the bystanders were straitened and they were weary of waiting for the event. At last Zau al-Makan cried out his war cry and rushed upon Hardub, King of C\u00e6sarea,[FN#452] and struck him a stroke that shore head from trunk and slew him on the spot. When the Infidels saw this, they charged in a body, compact and united, upon Zau al-Makan, who met them amidfield, and they engaged in hewing and foining, till blood ran in rills. Then the Moslems cried out, \"Allaho Akbar!\" (God is most Great) and \"There is no god but the God!\", and invoked salvation for the Prophet, the Bringer of Glad Tidings, the Bearer of Bad Tidings. And there befel a great fight, but Allah assigned victory to the Faithful and defeat to the Faithless. The Wazir Dandan shouted, \"Take your blood revenge for King Omar bin al Nu'uman and his son Sharrkan!\"; and bared his head and cried out to the Turks. Now there were by his side more than twenty thousand horse, and all charged with him as men, when the Faithless found naught to save their lives but flight. So they turned tail to fly while the biting sabre wrought its havoc and the Moslems slew of them that day some fifty thousand horse and took more than that number: much folk also were slain while going in at the gates, for the flock was great. Then the Greeks hove to the doors and swarmed up the walls to await the assault; and in fine the Moslem hosts returned to their tents aided to glory and victory, and King Zau al-Makan went in to his brother whom he found in most joyous case. So he made a prostration of thanks to the Bountiful and the Exalted; and then he came forward and gave Sharrkan joy of his recovery. Answered he, \"Verily we are all under the benediction of this Religious, holy and righteous, nor would you have been victorious, but for his accepted orisons; indeed all day he remained at prayer to invoke victory on the Moslems.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Zau al- Makan went in to his brother Sharrkan, he found him sitting with the Holy Man by his side; so he rejoiced and drew near him and gave him joy of his recovery. Answered he, \"Verily we are all under the benediction of this Recluse nor would you have been victorious but for his prayers, indeed he felt no fear this day and he ceased not supplication for the Moslems. I found strength return to me, when I heard your 'Allaho Akbar,' for then I knew you to be victorious over your enemies. But now recount to me, O my brother, what befel thee.\" So he told him all that had passed between him and the accursed Hardub and related how he had slain him and sent him to the malediction of Allah; and Sharrkan praised him and thanked him for his prowess. When Zat al-Dawahi heard tell of her son's death (and she still drest as a devotee), her face waxed yellow and her eyes ran over with railing tears: she kept her counsel, however, and feigned to the Moslems that she was glad and wept for excess of joy. But she said to herself, \"By the truth of the Messiah, there remaineth no profit of my life, if I burn not his heart for his brother, Sharrkan, even as he hath burned my heart for King Hardub, the mainstay of Christendom and the hosts of Crossdom!\" Still she kept her secret. And the Wazir Dandan and King Zau al-Makan and the Chamberlain remained sitting with Sharrkan till they had dressed and salved his wound; after which they gave him medicines and he began to recover strength; whereat they joyed with exceeding joy and told the troops who congratulated themselves, saying, \"To morrow he will ride with us and do manly devoir in the siege.\" Then said Sharrkan to them, \"Ye have fought through all this day and are aweary of fight; so it behoveth that you return to your places and sleep and not sit up.\" They accepted his counsel and then each went away to his own pavilion, and none remained with Sharrkan but a few servants and the old woman Zat al-Dawahi. He talked with her through part of the night, then he stretched himself to rest: and his servants did likewise and presently sleep overcame them all and they lay like the dead. Such was the case with Sharrkan and his men; but as regards the old woman she alone abode awake while they slumbered in the tent and, looking at Sharrkan she presently saw that he was drowned in sleep. Thereupon she sprang to her feet, as she were a scald she bear or a speckled snake, and drew from her waist cloth a dagger so poisoned that if laid thereon it would have melted a rock. Then she unsheathed the poniard and went up to Sharrkan's head and she drew the knife across his throat and severed his weasand and hewed off his head from his body. And once more she sprang to her feet; and, going the round of the sleeping servants, she cut off their heads also, lest they should awake. Then she left the tent and made for the Sultan's pavilion, but finding the guards on the alert, turned to that of the Wazir Dandan. Now she found him reading the Koran and when his sight fell upon her he said, \"Welcome to the Holy Man!\" Hearing this from the Wazir, her heart trembled and she said, \"The reason of my coming hither at this time is that I heard the voice of a saint amongst Allah's Saints and am going to him.\" Then she turned her back, but the Wazir said to himself, \"By Allah, I will follow our Devotee this night!\" So he rose and walked after her; but when the accursed old woman sensed his footsteps, she knew that he was following her: wherefore she feared the disgrace of discovery and said in herself, \"Unless I serve some trick upon him he will disgrace me.\" So she turned and said to him from afar, \"Ho, thou Wazir, I am going in search of this Saint that I may learn who he is; and, after learning this much, I will ask his leave for thee to visit him. Then I will come back and tell thee: for I fear thine accompanying me, without having his permission, lest he take umbrage at me seeing thee in my society.\" Now when the Wazir heard these words, he was ashamed to answer her; so he left her and returned to his tent, and would have slept; but sleep was not favourable to him and the world seemed heaped upon him. Presently he rose and went forth from the tent saying in himself, \"I will go to Sharrkan and chat with him till morning.\" But when he entered into Sharrkan's pavilion, he found the blood running like an aqueduct and saw the servants lying with their throats cut like beasts for food. At this he cried a cry which aroused all who were asleep; the folk hastened to him and, seeing the blood streaming, set up a clamour of weeping and wailing. Then the noise awoke the Sultan, who enquired what was the matter, and it was said to him, \"Sharrkan thy brother and his servants are murthered.\" So he rose in haste and entered the tent, and found the Wazir Dandan shrieking aloud and he saw his brother's body without a head. Thereat he swooned away and all the troops crowded around him, weeping and crying out, and so remained for a while, till he came to himself, when he looked at Sharrkan and wept with sore weeping, while the Wazir and Rustam and Bahram did the like. But the Chamberlain cried and lamented more than the rest and asked leave to absent himself, such was his alarm. Then said Zau al-Makan, \"Know ye who did this deed and how is it I see not the Devotee, him who the things of this world hath put away?\" Quoth the Wazir, \"And who should have been the cause of this affliction, save that Devotee, that Satan? By Allah, my heart abhorred him from the first, because I know that all who pretend to be absorbed in practices religious are vile and treacherous!\" And he repeated to the King the tale of how he would have followed the Religious, but he forbade him, whereupon the folk broke out into a tumult of weeping and lamentation and humbled themselves before Him who is ever near, Him who ever answereth prayer, supplicating that He would cause the false Devotee who denied Allah's testimony to fall into their hands. Then they laid Sharrken out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they laid Sharrkan out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues. Then they looked for the opening of the city gate; but it opened not and no sign of men appeared to them on the walls; whereat they wondered with exceeding wonder. But King Zau al-Makan said, \"By Allah, I will not turn back from them, though I sit here for years and years, till I take blood revenge for my brother Sharrkan and waste Constantinople and kill the King of the Nazarenes, even if death overcome me and I be at rest from this woeful world!\" Then he bade be brought out the treasure taken from the Monastery of Matruhina; and mustered the troops and divided the monies among them, and he left not one of them but he gave him gifts which contented him. Moreover, he assembled in the presence three hundred horse of every division and said to them, \"Do ye send supplies to your households, for I am resolved to abide by this city, year after year, till I have taken man bote for my brother Sharrkan, even if I die in this stead.\" And when the army heard these words and had received his gifts of money they replied, \"To hear is to obey!\" Thereupon he summoned couriers and gave them letters and charged them to deliver the same, together with the monies, to the soldiers' families and inform them that all were safe and satisfied, and acquaint them saying, \"We are encamped before Constantinople and we will either destroy it or die; and, albeit we be obliged to abide here months and years, we will not depart hence till we take it.\" Moreover, he bade the Wazir Dandan write to his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, and said to him, \"Acquaint her with what hath befallen us, and what be our situation and commend my child to her care since that, when I went out to war, my wife was near her delivery and by this time she must needs have been brought to bed; and if she hath given birth to a boy, as I have heard say, hasten your return and bring me the acceptable news.\" Then he gave them somewhat of money, which they pouched and set out at once; and all the people flocked forth to take leave of them and entrust them with the monies and the messages. After they had departed, Zau al-Makan turned to the Wazir Dandan and commanded him to advance with the army against the city walls. So the troops pushed forward, but found none on the ramparts, whereat they marvelled, while Zau al-Makan was troubled at the case, for he deeply mourned the severance from his brother Sharrkan and he was sore perturbed about that traitor the Ascetic. In this condition they abode three days without seeing anyone. So far concerning the Moslems; but as regards the Greeks and the cause of their refusing to fight during these three days the case was this. As soon as Zat al-Dawahi had slain Sharrkan, she hastened her march and reached the walls of Constantinople, where she called out in the Greek tongue to the guards to throw her down a rope. Quoth they, \"Who art thou?\"; and quoth she, \"I am Zat al- Dawahi.\" They knew her and let down a cord to which she tied herself and they drew her up; and, when inside the city, she went in to the King Afridun and said to him, \"What is this I hear from the Moslems? They say that my son King Hardub is slain.\" He answered, \"Yes;\" and she shrieked out and wept right grievously and ceased not weeping thus till she made Afridun and all who were present weep with her. Then she told the King how she had slain Sharrkan and thirty of his servants, whereat he rejoiced and thanked her; and, kissing her hands, exhorted her to resignation for the loss of her son. Said she, \"By the truth of the Messiah, I will not rest content with killing that dog of the Moslem dogs in blood revenge for my son, a King of the Kings of the age! Now there is no help for it but that I work some guile and I contrive a wile whereby to slay the Sultan Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram and ten thousand cavaliers of the army of Al-Islam; for it shall never be said that my son's head be paid with the bloodwit of Sharrkan's head; no, never!\" Then said she to King Afridun, \"Know, O King of the Age, that it is my wish to set forth mourning for my son and to cut my Girdle and to break the Crosses.\" Replied Afridun, \"Do what thou desire; I will not gainsay thee in aught. And if thou prolong thy mourning for many days it were a little thing; for though the Moslems resolve to beleaguer us years and years, they will never win their will of us nor gain aught of us save trouble and weariness.\" Then the Accursed One (when she had ended with the calamity she had wrought and the ignominies which in herself she had thought) took ink case and paper and wrote thereon: \"From Shawahi, Zat al- Dawahi, to the host of the Moslems. Know ye that I entered your country and duped by my cunning your nobles and at first hand I slew your King Omar bin al-Nu'uman in the midst of his palace. Moreover, I slew, in the affair of the mountain pass and of the cave, many of your men; and the last I killed were Sharrkan and his servants. And if fortune do not stay me and Satan obey me, I needs must slay me your Sultan and the Wazir Dandan, for I am she who came to you in disguise of a Recluse and who heaped upon you my devices and deceits. Wherefore, an you would be in safety after this, fare ye forth at once; and if you seek your own destruction cease not abiding for the nonce; and though ye tarry here years and years, ye shall not do your desire on us. And so peace be yours!\" After writing her writ she devoted three days to mourning for King Hardub; arid, on the fourth, she called a Knight and bade him take the letter and make it fast to a shaft and shoot it into the Moslem camp. When this was done, she entered the church and gave herself up to weeping and wailing for the loss of her son, saying to him who took the kingship after him, \"Nothing will serve me but I must kill Zau al-Makan and all the nobles of Al-Islam.\" Such was the case with her; but as regards what occurred to the Moslems, all passed three days in trouble and anxiety, and on the fourth when gazing at the walls behold, they saw a knight holding a bow and about to shoot an arrow along whose side a letter was bound. So they waited till he had shot it among them and the Sultan bade the Wazir Dandan take the missive and read it. He perused it accordingly; and, when Zau al-Makan heard it to end and understood its purport, his eyes filled with tears and he shrieked for agony at her perfidy; and the Minister Dandan said, \"By Allah, my heart shrank from her!\" Quoth the Sultan, \"How could this whore play her tricks upon us twice? But by the Almighty I will not depart hence till I fill her cleft with molten lead and jail her with the jailing of a bird encaged, then bind her with her own hair and crucify her over the gate of Constantinople.\" And he called to mind his brother and wept with excessive weeping. But when Zat al-Dawahi arrived amongst the Infidels and related to them her adventures at length, they rejoiced at her safety and at the slaying of Sharrkan. There upon the Moslems addressed themselves again to the siege of the city and the Sultan promised his men that, if it should be taken, he would divide its treasures among them in equal parts. But he dried not his tears grieving for his brother till his body was wasted and sick, growing thin as a tooth pick. Presently the Wazir Dandan came in to him and said, \"Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; in very sooth thy brother died not but because his hour was come, and there is no profit in this mourning. How well saith the poet,\n\n\"Whatso is not to be no sleight shall bring to pass; * What is to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     be without a failure shall become;\nSoon the becoming fortune shall be found to be, * And Folly's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     brother[FN#453] shall abide forlorn and glum.\"\n\nWherefore do thou leave this weeping and wailing and hearten thy heart to bear arms.\" He replied, \"O Wazir, my heart is heavy for the death of my father and my brother and for our absence from hearth and home; and my mind is concerned for my subjects.\" Thereupon the Wazir and the bystanders wept; but they ceased not from pushing forward the siege of Constantinople for a length of days. And they being thus, behold, news arrived from Baghdad, by one of the Emirs to the effect that the King's wife had been blessed with a boy, and that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had named him K\u00e1nm\u00e1k\u00e1n.[FN#454] Moreover, that the boy bid fair to be famous, already showing wondrous signs and marvellous tokens; and that she had commanded the Olema and the preachers to pray for mother and child from the pulpits and bless them in all wise; furthermore that the twain were well, that the land had enjoyed abundant rains, and that his comrade the Fireman was established in all prosperity, with eunuchs and slaves to wait upon him; but that he was still ignorant of what had befallen him. And she ended with the greeting of peace. Then quoth Zau al- Makan to the Wazir Dandan, \"Now is my back strengthened for that I have been blest with a son whose name is Kanmakan.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when they brought him the news of his wife having borne him a boy child, Zau al- Makan rejoiced with great joy and cried, \"Now is my back strengthened, for that I have been blessed with a son[FN#455] whose name is Kanmakan.\" And he spake to the Wazir Dandan, saying, \"I am minded to leave this mourning and order perfections of the Koran for my brother and command almsdeeds on his account.\" Quoth the Wazir, \"Thy design is good.\" Thereupon he caused tents to be pitched over his brother's tomb; so they raised them and gathered together such of the men at arms as could repeat the Koran; and some began reciting the Holy volume; whilst others chanted litanies containing the names of Allah, and thus they did till the morning. Then Zau al-Makan went up to the grave of his brother Sharrkan and poured forth copious tears, and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"They bore him bier'd, and all who followed wept * With Moses'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 shrieks what day o'erhead shook Tor;[FN#456]\nTill reached the grave which Pate had made his home, * Dug in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   men's souls who one sole God adore:\nNe'er had I thought before to see my joy * Borne on the bier\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   which heads of bearers bore:\nAh no! nor ere they homed thee in the dust * That stars of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   heaven earth ever covered o'er.\nIs the tomb dweller hostage of a stead, * Where light and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    splendour o'er thy face shall pour?\nPraise to restore his life her word hath pledged: * Cribbed and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   confined he shall dispread the more!\"\n\nWhen Zau al-Makan had made an end of his versifying he wept and wept with him all the troops; then he came to the grave and threw himself upon it wild with woe, and the Wazir repeated the words of the poet,\n\n\"Pain leaving life that fleets thou hast th' eternal won; * Thou\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    didst as whilom many a doer like thee hath done\nLeftest this worldly house without reproach or blame; * Ah, may\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    th' ex change secure thee every benison!\nThou west from hostile onset shield and firm defence, * For us to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    baffle shafts and whistling spears to shun.\nI see this world is only cheat and vanity, * Where man naught\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   else must seek but please the Truthful One:\nTh' Empyrean's Lord allow thee bower of heavenly bliss, * And wi'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    thy faithful friends The Guide show goodly wone:\nI bid thee last good e'en with sigh of bitter grief, * Seeing the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     West in woe for lack of Easting Sun.\"\n\n\nWhen the Wazir Dandan had finished his reciting, he wept with sore weeping and the tears rained from his eyes like cushioned pearls. Then came forward one who had been of Sharrkan's boon companions in his cups and he wept till ran in rills the drops, and he enumerated the dead man's generous qualities, reciting the following pentastichs,\n\n\n\"Where gone is Bounty since thy hand is turned to clay? * And I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     in misery lie since thou west ta'en away.\nSee'st not, O litter guide[FN#457] (Heaven keep thee glad and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     gay!), * How tears adorn my cheeks, these furrowed wrinkles\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     fray?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        A sight to joy shine eyes and fill thee with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        dismay.[FN#458]\nBy Allah ne'er this heart within I spoke of thee; * Ah no! nor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     dared my sight to see thy brilliancy:\nSave that my tear drops sorest wound have garred me dree * Yea!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     and if e'er on other rest these eyne of me,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        May yearning draw their reins nor suffer sleep to see.\"\n\n\nAnd when the man stinted reciting, Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan wept and the whole army was moved to tears; after which all retired to their tents, and the King turning to the Wazir took counsel with him concerning the conduct of the campaign. On this wise the two passed days and nights, while Zau al-Makan was weighed down with grief and mourning till at last he said, \"I long to hear stories and adventures of Kings and tales of lover folk enslaved by love; haply Allah may make this to solace that which is on my heart of heavy anxiety, and stint and stay my weeping and wailing.\" Quoth the Wazir, \"If naught can dispel thy trouble but hearing curious tales of Kings and people long gone before and stories of folk enslaved by love of yore, and so forth, this thing were easy, for I had no other business, in the lifetime of thy father (who hath found mercy) than to relate stories and to repeat verses to him. This very night I will tell thee a tale of a lover and his beloved, so shall thy breast be broadened.\" When Zau al-Makan heard these words from the Minister, his heart was set upon that which had been promised to him and he did nothing but watch for the coming of the night, that he might hear what the Wazir Dandan had to tell of the Kings of yore and distracted lovers long gone before. And hardly would he believe that night had fallen ere he bade light the wax candles and the lamps and bring all that was needful of meat and drink and perfume gear, and what not; and when all was in presence, he summoned the Wazir Dandan, and the Emirs Rustam and Bahram and Tarkash and the Grand Chamberlain; then waited till the whole party was seated before him; whereupon he turned to the Minister and said, \"Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us.\" Replied the Wazir, \"With joy and good will.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau Al-Makan summoned the Wazir and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram, he turned towards the Minister Dandan and said, \"Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us.\" Replied the Wazir, \"With love and gladness! Know, O auspicious King, that there reached my ears a relation of a lover and a loved one and of the discourse between them and what befel them of things rare and fair, a story such as repelleth care from the heart and dispelleth sorrow like unto that of the patriarch Jacob[FN#459]; and it is as follows\":\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n[FN#138] This knightly tale, the longest in the Nights (xliv.\u2014 cxlv.), about one-eighth of the whole, does not appear in the Bres. Edit. Lane, who finds it \"objectionable,\" reduces it to two of its episodes, Az\u00edz-cum-Az\u00edzah and T\u00e1j al-Mul\u00fak. On the other hand it has been converted into a volume (8vo, pp. 240) \"Scharkan, Conte Arabe,\" etc. Traduit par M. Asselan Riche, etc. Paris: Dondey-Dupr\u00e9. 1829. It has its longueurs and at times is longsome enough; but it is interesting as a comparison between the chivalry of Al-Islam and European knight-errantry. Although all the characters are fictitious the period is evidently in the early crusading days. C\u00e6sarea, the second capital of Palestine, taken during the Caliphate of Omar (A.H. 19) and afterwards recovered, was fortified in A.H. 353 = 963 as a base against the Arabs by the Emperor Phocas, the Arab. \"Nakf\u00far\" i.e. Nicephorus. In A.H. 498=1104, crusading craft did much injury by plundering merchantmen between Egypt and Syria, to which allusion is found in the romance. But the story teller has not quite made up his mind about which C\u00e6sarea he is talking, and M. Riche tells us that C\u00e9sar\u00e9e is a \"ville de la Mauritanie, en Afrique\" (p. 20).\n\n[FN#139] The fifth Ommiade Caliph reign. A.H. 65-86 = 685-704.\n\n[FN#140] This does not merely mean that no one was safe from his wrath: or, could approach him in the heat of fight: it is a reminiscence of the masterful \"King Kulayb,\" who established game-laws in his dominions and would allow no man to approach his camp-fire. Moreover the Jinn lights a fire to decoy travellers, but if his victim be bold enough to brave him, he invites him to take advantage of the heat.\n\n[FN#141] China.\n\n[FN#142] The Jaxartes and the Bactrus (names very loosely applied).\n\n[FN#143] In full \"Sharrun k\u00e1na\" i.e. an evil (Sharr) has come to being (k\u00e1na) that is, \"bane to the foe\" a pagan and knightly name. The hero of the Romance \"Al-Dalhamah\" is described as a bitter gourd (colocynth), a viper, a calamity.\n\n[FN#144] This is a Moslem law (Koran chaps. iv. bodily borrowed from the Talmud) which does not allow a man to marry one wife unless he can carnally satisfy her. Moreover he must distribute his honours equally and each wife has a right to her night unless she herself give it up. This was the case even with the spouses of the Prophet; and his biography notices several occasions when his wives waived their rights in favour of one another M. Riche kindly provides the King with la piquante francaise (p. 15).\n\n[FN#145] So the celebrated mosque in Stambul, famed for being the largest church in the world is known to the Greeks as \"Agia (pron. Aya) Sophia\" and to Moslems as \"Aye Sof\u00edyeh\" (Holy Wisdom) i.e. the Logos or Second Person of the Trinity (not a Saintess). The sending a Christian girl as a present to a Moslem would, in these days, be considered highly scandalous. But it was done by the Mukaukis or Coptic Governor of Egypt (under Heraclius) who of course hated the Greeks. This worthy gave two damsels to Mohammed; one called S\u00edr\u00edn and the other M\u00e1riyah (Maria) whom the Prophet reserved for his especial use and whose abode is still shown at Al-Medinah. The Rev. Doctor Badger (loc. cit. p. 972) gives the translation of an epistle by Mohammed to this Mukaukis, written in the Cufic character ( ? ?) and sealed \"Mohammed, The Apostle of Allah.\" My friend seems to believe that it is an original, but upon this subject opinions will differ. It is, however, exceedingly interesting, beginning with \"Bismillah,\" etc., and ending (before the signature) with a quotation from the Koran (iii. 57); and it may be assumed as a formula addressee to foreign potentates by a Prophet who had become virtually \"King of Arabia.\"\n\n[FN#146] This prayer before \"doing the deed of kind\" is, I have said, Moslem as well Christian.\n\n[FN#147] Exodus i. 16, quoted by Lane (M. E., chaps. xxvii.).\nTorrens in his Notes cites Drayton's \"Moon-calf':\u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Bring forth the birth-stool\u2014no, let it alone;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    She is so far beyond all compass grown,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Some other new device us needs must stead,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Or else she never can be brought to bed.\nIt is the \"groaning-chair\" of Poor Robin's Almanac (1676) and we find it alluded to in Boccaccio, the classical sedile which according to scoffers has formed the papal chair (a curule seat) ever since the days of Pope Joan, when it has been held advisable for one of the Cardinals to ascertain that His Holiness possesses all the instruments of virility. This \"Kurs\u00ed al-wil\u00e1dah\" is of peculiar form on which the patient is seated. A most interesting essay might be written upon the various positions preferred during delivery, e.g. the wild Irish still stand on all fours, like the so-called \"lower animals.\" Amongst the Moslems of Waday, etc., a cord is hung from the top of the hut, and the woman in labour holds on to it standing with her legs apart, till the midwife receives the child.\n\n[FN#148] Some Orientalists call \"lullilooing\" the trilling cry, which is made by raising the voice to its highest pitch and breaking it by a rapid succession of touches on the palate with the tongue-tip, others \"Ziraleet\" and Zagaleet, and one traveller tells us that it began at the marriage-festival of Isaac and Rebecca (!). Arabs term it classically \"Tahl\u00edl\" and vulgarly \"Zaghrutah\" (Plur. Zagh\u00e1rit) and Persians \"Kil.\" Finally in Don Quixote we have \"Lelilies,\" the battle-cry of the Moors (Duffield iii. 289). Dr. Buchanan likens it to a serpent uttering human sounds, but the good missionary heard it at the festival of Jagannath. (Pilgrimage iii. 197 )\n\n[FN#149] i.e. \"Light of the Place\" (or kingdom) and \"Delight of the\nAge.\"\n\n[FN#150] It is utterly absurd to give the old heroic Persian name Afridun or Furaydun, the destroyer of Zoh\u00e1k or Zahh\u00e1k to a Greek, but such anachronisms are characteristic of The Nights and are evidently introduced on purpose. See Boccaccio, ix. 9.\n\n[FN#151] Arab. \"Yun\u00e1n\" lit. Ionia, which applies to all Greece, insular and continental, especially to ancient Greece.\n\n[FN#152] In 1870 I saw at Sidon a find of some hundreds of gold\n\"Philippi\" and \"Alexanders.\"\n\n[FN#153] M. Riche has (p. 21), \"Ces talismans travaill\u00e9s par le ciseau du c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Califaziri,\" adding in a note, \"Je pense que c'est un sculpteur Arabe.\"\n\n[FN#154] This periphrase, containing what seems to us a useless negative, adds emphasis in Arabic.\n\n[FN#155] This bit of geographical information is not in the Bull\nEdit.\n\n[FN#156] In Pers. = a tooth, the popular word.\n\n[FN#157] This preliminary move, called in Persian Nakl-i Safar, is generally mentioned. So the Franciscan monks in California, when setting out for a long journey through the desert, marched three times round the convent and pitched tents for the night under its walls.\n\n[FN#158] In Arab. \"Khazinah\" or \"Khaznah\" lit. a treasure, representing 1,000 \"K\u00eds\" or purses (each=\u00a35). The sum in the text is 7,000 purses X 5=\u00a335,000.\n\n[FN#159] Travellers often prefer such sites because they are sheltered from the wind, and the ground is soft for pitching tents; but many have come to grief from sudden torrents following rain.\n\n[FN#160] Arab \"Gh\u00e1bah\" not a forest in our sense of the word, but a place where water sinks and the trees (mostly Mimosas), which elsewhere are widely scattered, form a comparatively dense growth and collect in thickets. These are favourite places for wild beasts during noon-heats.\n\n[FN#161] At various times in the East Jews and Christians were ordered to wear characteristic garments, especially the Zunn\u00e1r or girdle.\n\n[FN#162] The description is borrowed from the Coptic Convent, which invariably has an inner donjon or keep. The oldest monastery in the world is Mar Antonios (St. Anthony the Hermit) not far from Suez. (Gold Mines of Midian, p. 85.)\n\n[FN#163] \"Daw\u00e1h\u00ed,\" plur. of D\u00e1hiyah = a mishap. The title means \"Mistress of Misfortunes\" or Queen of Calamities (to the enemy); and the venerable lady, as will be seen, amply deserved her name, which is pronounced Z\u00e1t al-Daw\u00e1h\u00ed.\n\n[FN#164] Arab. \"Kunfuz\"=hedgehog or porcupine.\n\n[FN#165] These flowers of speech are mere familiarities, not insults. In societies where the sexes are separated speech becomes exceedingly free. \"\u00c9tourdie que vous \u00eates,\" says M. Riche, toning down the text.\n\n[FN#166] Arab. \"Zirt,\" a low word. The superlative \"Zarr\u00e1t\" (fartermost) or, \"Abu Zirt\" (Father of farts) is a facetious term among the bean-eating Fellahs and a deadly insult amongst the Badawin (Night ccccx.). The latter prefer the word Tagg\u00e1a (Pilgrimage iii. 84). We did not disdain the word in farthingale=pet en air.\n\n[FN#167] Arab. \"kicked\" him, i.e. with the sharp corner of the shovel-stirrup. I avoid such expressions as \"spurring\" and \"pricking over the plain,\" because apt to give a wrong idea.\n\n[FN#168] Arab. \"Allaho Akbar!\" the classical Moslem slogan.\n\n[FN#169] Arab horses are never taught to leap, so she was quite safe on the other side of a brook nine feet broad.\n\n[FN#170] \"Batr\u00edk\" (vulg. Bitr\u00edk)=patricius, a title given to\nChristian knights who commanded ten thousand men; the Tarkhan (or\nNobb) heading four thousand, and the Kaumas (Arab. K\u00e1id) two\nhundred. It must not be confounded with Batrak (or\nBatrik)=patriarcha. (Lane's Lex.)\n\n[FN#171] Arab. \"K\u00e1zi al-Kuz\u00e1t,\" a kind of Chief Justice or Chancellor. The office wag established under the rule of Harun al Rashid, who so entitled Ab\u00fa Y\u00fasuf Ya'akab al-Ans\u00e1ri: therefore the allusion is anachronistic. The same Caliph also caused the Olema to dress as they do still.\n\n[FN#172] The allusion is Koranic: \"O men, if ye be in doubt concerning the resurrection, consider that He first created you of the dust of the ground (Adam), afterwards of seed\" (chaps. xxii.). But the physiological ideas of the Koran are curious. It supposes that the Mani or male semen is in the loins and that of women in the breast bone (chaps Ixxxvi.); that the mingled seed of the two (chaps. Ixxvi.) fructifies the ovary and that the child is fed through the navel with menstruous blood, hence the cessation of the catamenia. Barzoi (Kalilah and D\u00edmnah) says:\u2014 \"Man's seed, falling into the woman's womb, is mixed with her seed and her blood: when it thickens and curdles the Spirit moves it and it turns about like liquid cheese; then it solidifies, its arteries are formed, its limbs constructed and its joints distinguished. If the babe is a male, his face is placed towards his mother's back; if a female, towards her belly.\" (P. 262, Mr. L G.N. Keith- Falconer's translation.) But there is a curious prolepsis of the spermatozoa-theory. We read (Koran chaps. vii.), \"Thy Lord drew forth their posterity from the loins of the sons of Adam;\" and the commentators say that Allah stroked Adam's back and extracted from his loins all his posterity, which shall ever be, in the shape of small ants; these confessed their dependence on God and were dismissed to return whence they came.\" From this fiction it appears (says Sale) that the doctrine of pre-existence is not unknown to the Mohammedans, and there is some little conformity between it and the modern theory of generatio ex animalculis in semine marium. The poets call this Yaum-i-Alast = the Day of Am-I-not (-your Lord)? which Sir William Jones most unhappily translated \"Art thou not with thy Lord ?\" (Alasta bi Rabbi- kum); fand they produce a grand vision of unembodied spirits appearing in countless millions before their Creator.\n\n[FN#173] The usual preliminary of a wrestling bout.\n\n[FN#174] In Eastern wrestling this counts as a fair fail. So Ajax fell on his back with Ulysses on his breast. (Iliad xxxii., 700, etc.)\n\n[FN#175] So biting was allowed amongst the Greeks in the , the final struggle on the ground.\n\n[FN#176] Supposed to be names of noted wrestlers. \"Kayim\" (not El-Kim as Torrens has it) is a term now applied to a juggler or \"professor\" of legerdemain who amuses people in the streets with easy tricks. (Lane, M. E., chaps. xx.)\n\n[FN#177] Lit. \"laughed in his face\" which has not the unpleasant meaning it bears in English.\n\n[FN#178] Arab. \"Abu riy\u00e1h\"=a kind of child's toy. It is our \"bull-roarer\" well known in Australia and parts of Africa.\n\n[FN#179] The people of the region south of the Caspian which is called \"Sea of Daylam.\" It has a long history; for which see D'Herbelot, s.v. \"Dilem.\"\n\n[FN#180] Coptic convents in Egypt still affect these drawbridges over the keep-moat.\n\n[FN#181] Koran iv., xxii. etc., meaning it is lawful to marry women taken in war after the necessary purification although their husbands be still living. This is not permitted with a free woman who is a True Believer. I have noted that the only concubine slave-girl mentioned in the Koran are these \"captives possessed by the right hand.\"\n\n[FN#182] The Amazonian dame is a favourite in folk-lore and is an ornament to poetry from the Iliad to our modern day. Such heroines, apparently unknown to the Pagan Arabs, were common in the early ages of Al-Islam as Ockley and Gibbon prove, and that the race is not extinct may be seen in my Pilgrimage (iii. 55) where the sister of Ibn Rumi resolved to take blood revenge for her brother.\n\n[FN#183] And Solomon said, \"O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne ?\" A terrible genius (i.e. an If rit of the Jinn named Dhakwan or the notorious Sakhr) said, \" I will bring it unto thee before thou arise from thy seat (of justice); for I am able to perform it, and may be trusted\" (Koran, xxvii. 38-39). Balk\u00eds or Bilk\u00eds (says the Durrat al-Ghaww\u00e1s) daughter of Hoz\u00e1d bin Sharhab\u00edl, twenty-second in the list of the rulers of Al- Yaman, according to some murdered her husband, and became, by Moslem ignorance, the Biblical \" Queen of Sheba.\" The Abyssinians transfer her from Arabian Saba to Ethiopia and make her the mother by Solomon of Menelek, their proto-monarch; thus claiming for their royalties an antiquity compared with which all reigning houses in the world are of yesterday. The dates of the Tab\u00e1bi'ah or Tobbas prove that the Bilkis of history ruled Al-Yaman in the early Christian era.\n\n[FN#184] Arab. \"Fass,\" fiss or fuss; the gem set in a ring; also applied to a hillock rounded en cabochon. In The Nights it is used to signify \"a fine gem.\"\n\n[FN#185] This prominence of the glut\u00e6i muscles is always insisted upon, because it is supposed to promise well in a bed-fellow. In Somali land where the people are sub- steatopygous, a rich young man, who can afford such luxury, will have the girls drawn up in line and choose her to wife who projects furthest behind\n\n[FN#186] The \"bull\" is only half mine.\n\n[FN#187] A favourite Arab phrase, the \"hot eye\" is one full of tears.\n\n[FN#188] i.e., \"Coral,\" coral branch, a favourite name for a slave-girl, especially a negress. It is the older \"Morgiana.\" I do not see why Preston in Al-Har\u00edni's \"Makamah (S\u00e9ance) of Singar\" renders it pearls, because Golius gives \"small pearls,\" when it is evidently \"coral.\" Richardson (Dissert. xlviii.) seems to me justified in finding the Pari (fairy) Marjan of heroic Persian history reflected in the Fairy Morgain who earned off King Arthur after the battle of Camelon.\n\n[FN#189] Arab. \"'Ud Jalaki\"=Jalak or Jalik being a poetical and almost obsolete name of Damascus.\n\n[FN#190] The fountain in Paradise whose water shall be drunk with \"pure\" wine mixed and sealed with musk (for clay). It is so called because it comes from the \"Sanam\" (Sanima, to be high) boss or highest ridge of the Moslem Heaven (Koran lv. 78 and lxxxiii. 27). Mr. Rodwell says \"it is conveyed to the highest apartments in the Pavilions of Paradise.\" (?)\n\n[FN#191] This \"hysterical\" temperament is not rare even amongst the bravest Arabs.\n\n[FN#192] An idea evidently derived from the \u00c6olipyla (olla animatoria) the invention of Hero Alexandrinus, which showed that the ancient Egyptians could apply the motive force of steam.\n\n[FN#193] Kuthayyir ibn Abi Jumah, a poet and far-famed R\u00e1w\u00ed or Tale-reciter, mentioned by Ibn Khallikan he lived at Al-Medinah and sang the attractions of one Azzah, hence his soubriquet S\u00e1hib (lover of) Azzah. As he died in A. H. 105 (=726), his presence here is a gross anachronism the imaginary Sharrkan flourished before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marw\u00e1n A. H. 65-86.\n\n[FN#194] Jam\u00edl bin Ma'amar, a poet and lover contemporary with\nAl-Kuthayrir.\n\n[FN#195] Arab. \"Tafazzal,\" a word of frequent use in conversation=\"favour me,\" etc.\n\n[FN#196] The word has a long history. From the Gr. or is the Lat. stibium; while the Low Latin \"antimonium\" and the Span. Althimod are by metathesis for Al-Ithmid. The dictionaries define the substance as a stone from which antimony is prepared, but the Arabs understand a semi-mythical mineral of yellow colour which enters into the veins of the eyes and gives them Iynx-like vision. The famous Anz nicknamed Zark\u00e1 (the blue eyed) of Yam\u00e1mah (Province) used it; and, according to some, invented Kohl. When her (protohistoric) tribe Jadis had destroyed all the rival race of Tasm, except Rib\u00e1h ibn Murrah; the sole survivor fled to the Tobba of Al-Yaman, who sent a host to avenge him. The king commanded his Himyarites to cut tree-boughs and use them as screens (again Birnam wood). Zark\u00e1 from her Utum, or peel-tower, saw the army three marches off and cried, \"O folk, either trees or Himyar are coming upon you!\" adding, in Rajaz verse:\u2014\n\nI swear by Allah that trees creep onward, or that Himyar beareth somewhat which he draweth along!\n\nShe then saw a man mending his sandal. But Jadis disbelieved; Cassandra was slain and, when her eyes were cut out the vessels were found full of Ithmid. Hence Al-Mutanabbi sang:\n\n\"Sharper-sighted than Zark\u00e1 of Jau\" (Yam\u00e1mah).\n\nSee C. de Perceval i. 101; Arab. Prov. i. 192; and Chenery p. 381.\n(The Assemblies of Al-Hariri; London, Williams and Norgate, 1867).\nI have made many enquiries into the true nature of Ithmid and\nfailed to learn anything: on the Upper Nile the word is=Kohl.\n\n[FN#197] The general colour of chessmen in the East, where the game is played on a cloth more often than a board.\n\n[FN#198] Arab. \"Al-fil,\" the elephant=the French fol or fou and our bishop. I have derived \"elephant\" from P\u00edl (old Persian, Sansk. Pilu) and Arab. Fil, with the article Al-Fil, whence the Greek the suffix\u2014as being devoted to barbarous words as Obod-as (Al Ubayd), Aretas (Al-H\u00e1ris), etc. Mr. Isaac Taylor (The Alphabet i. 169), preserves the old absurdity of \"eleph-ant or ox-like (!) beast of Africa.\" Prof. Sayce finds the word al-ab (two distinct characters) in line 3, above the figure of an (Indian) elephant, on the black obelisk of Nimrod Mound, and suggests an Assyrian derivation.\n\n[FN#199] Arab. \"Shaukat\" which may also mean the \"pride\" or \"mainstay\" (of the army).\n\n[FN#200] Lit. \"smote him on the tendons of his neck.\" This is the famous shoulder-cut (Tawash shuh) which, with the leg-cut (Kalam), formed, and still forms, the staple of Eastern attack with the sword.\n\n[FN#201] Arab. \"Dir\u00e1s.\" Easterns do not thresh with flails. The material is strewed over a round and smoothed floor of dried mud in the open air and threshed by different connivances. In Egypt the favourite is a chair-like machine called \"Norag,\" running on iron plates and drawn by bulls or cows over the corn. Generally, however, Moslems prefer the old classical , the Tribulum of Virgil and Varro, a slipper-shaped sled of wood garnished on the sole with large-headed iron nails, or sharp fragments of flint or basalt. Thus is made the \"Tibn\" or straw, the universal hay of the East, which our machines cannot imitate.\n\n[FN#202] These numbers appear to be grossly exaggerated, but they were possible in the days of sword and armour: at the battle of Saffayn the Caliph Ali is said to have cut down five hundred and twenty-three men in a single night.\n\n[FN#203] Arab. \"Bika'\u00e1\": hence the \"Buka'ah\" or Clesyria.\n\n[FN#204] Richardson in his excellent dictionary (note 103) which modern priggism finds \"unscientific \" wonderfully derives this word from Arab. \"Khatt\u00e1f,\" a snatcher (i.e. of women), a ravisher. It is an evident corruption of \"captivus\" through Italian and French\n\n[FN#205] These periodical and fair-like visitations to convents are still customary; especially amongst the Christians of Damascus.\n\n[FN#206] Camphor being then unknown.\n\n[FN#207] The \"wrecker\" is known all over the world; and not only barbarians hold that ships driven ashore become the property of the shore\n\n[FN#208] Arab. \"Jokh\": it is not a dictionary word, but the only term in popular use for European broadcloth.\n\n[FN#209] The second person plural is used because the writer would involve the subjects of his correspondent in the matter.\n\n[FN#210] This part of the phrase, which may seem unnecessary to the European, is perfectly intelligible to all Orientalists. You may read many an Eastern letter and not understand it. Compare Boccacoo iv. 1.\n\n[FN#211] i.e. he was greatly agitated\n\n[FN#212] In text \"Li-ajal a al-Taudi'a,\" for the purpose of farewelling, a low Egyptianism; emphatically a \"Kal\u00e1m w\u00e1ti.\" (Pilgrimage thee iii. 330.)\n\n[FN#213] In the Mac. Edit. Sharrkan speaks, a clerical error.\n\n[FN#214] The Farsakh (Germ. Stunde) a measure of time rather than distance, is an hour's travel or its equivalent, a league, a meile=three English stat. miles. The word is still used in Persia its true home, but not elsewhere. It is very old, having been determined as a lineal measure of distance by Herodotus (ii. 5 and 6 ; v. 53), who computes it at 30 furlongs (=furrow-lengths, 8 to the stat. mile). Strabo (xi.) makes it range from 40 to 60 stades (each=606 feet 9 inches), and even now it varies between 1,500 to 6,000 yards. Captain Francklin (Tour to Persia) estimates it = about four miles. (Pilgrimage ii. 113.)\n\n[FN#215] Arab. \"Ashhab.\" Names of colours are few amongst semi civilised peoples, but in Arabia there is a distinct word for every shade of horseflesh.\n\n[FN#216] She had already said to him \"Thou art beaten in everything!\"\n\n[FN#217] Showing that she was still a Christian.\n\n[FN#218] This is not Badawi sentiment: the honoratioren amongst wild people would scorn such foul play; but amongst the settled Arabs honour between men and women is unknown and such \"hocussing\" would be held quite fair.\n\n[FN#219] The table of wine, in our day, is mostly a japanned tray with glasses and bottles, saucers of pickles and fruits and, perhaps, a bunch of flowers and aromatic herbs. During the Caliphate the \"wine-service\" was on a larger scale.\n\n[FN#220] Here the \"Bhang\" (almost a generic term applied to hellebore, etc.) may be hyoscyamus or henbane. Yet there are varieties of Cannabis, such as the Dakha of South Africa capable of most violent effect. I found the use of the drug well known to the negroes of the Southern United States and of the Brazil, although few of their owners had ever heard of it.\n\n[FN#221] Amongst Moslems this is a reference to Adam who first \"sinned against himself,' and who therefore is called \" Saf\u00edyu'llah,\" the Pure of Allah. (Pilgrimage iii. 333.)\n\n[FN#222] Meaning, an angry, violent man.\n\n[FN#223] Arab. \"Insh\u00e1d,\" which may mean reciting the verse of another or improvising one's own. In Modern Egypt \"Munshid\" is the singer or reciter of poetry at Zikrs (Lane M. E. chaps. xxiv.). Here the verses are quite bad enough to be improvised by the hapless Princess.\n\n[FN#224] The negro skin assumes this dust colour in cold, fear, concupiscence and other mental emotions.\n\n[FN#225] He compares her glance with the blade of a Yamani sword, a lieu commun of Eastern poetry. The weapons are famous in The Nights; but the best sword-cutlery came from Persia as the porcelain from China to Sana'\u00e1. Here, however, is especial allusion as to the sword \"Samsam\" or \"Samsamah.\" It belonged to the Himyarite Tobba, Amru bin Ma'ad Kurb, and came into the hands of Harun al-Rashid. When the Emperor of the Greeks sent a present of superior sword-blades to him by way of a brave, the Caliph, in the presence of the Envoys, took \"Samsam\" in hand and cut the others in twain as if they were cabbages without the least prejudice to the edge of \"Samsam.\"\n\n[FN#226] This touch of pathos is truly Arab. So in the \"Romance of Dalhamah\" (Lane, M. E. xxiii.) the infant Gundubah sucks the breast of its dead mother and the King exclaims, \"If she had committed this crime she would not be affording the child her milk after she was dead.\"\n\n[FN#227] Arab. \"Sadda'l-Akt\u00e1r,\" a term picturesque enough to be preserved in English. \"Sadd,\" I have said, is a wall or dyke, the term applied to the great dam of water- plants which obstructs the navigation of the Upper Nile, the lilies and other growths floating with the current from the (Victoria) Nyanza Lake. I may note that we need no longer derive from India the lotus-llily so extensively used by the Ancient Egyptians and so neglected by the moderns that it has well nigh disappeared. All the Central African basins abound in the Nymph\u00e6a and thence it found its way down the Nile Valley.\n\n[FN#228] Arab. \"Al Marh\u00famah\": equivalent to our \"late lamented.\"\n\n[FN#229] Vulgarly pronounced \"Mahmal,\" and by Egyptians and Turks \"Mehmel.\" Lane (M. E. xxiv.) has figured this queenly litter and I have sketched and described it in my Pilgrimage (iii. 12).\n\n[FN#230] For such fits of religious enthusiasm see my Pilgrimage (iii. 254).\n\n[FN#231] \"Ir\u00e1k\" (Mesopotamia) means \"a level country beside the banks of a ever.\"\n\n[FN#232] \"Al Kuds,\" or \"Bays al-Mukaddas,\" is still the popular name of Jerusalem, from the Heb. Yerushalaim ha-Kadushah (legend on shekel of Simon Maccabeus).\n\n[FN#233] \"Follow the religion of Abraham\" says the Koran (chaps. iii. 89). Abraham, titled \"Khal\u00edlu'llah,\" ranks next in dignity to Mohammed, preceding Isa, I need hardly say that his tomb is not in Jerusalem nor is the tomb itself at Hebron ever visited. Here Moslems (soi disant) are allowed by the jealousies of Europe to close and conceal a place which belongs to the world, especially to Jews and Christians. The tombs, if they exist, lie in a vault or cave under the Mosque.\n\n[FN#234] Ab\u00e1, or Ab\u00e1yah, vulg. Abayah, is a cloak of hair, goat's or camel's; too well known to require description.\n\n[FN#235] Arab. \"Al-Wakk\u00e1d,\" the man who lights and keeps up the bath-fires.\n\n[FN#236] Arab. \"M\u00e1 al-Khal\u00e1f\" (or \"Khil\u00e1f\") a sickly perfume but much prized, made from the flowers of the Salix \u00c6gyptiaca.\n\n[FN#237] Used by way of soap; like glasswort and other plants.\n\n[FN#238] i.e., \"Thou art only just recovered.\"\n\n[FN#239] To \"Nakh\" is to gurgle \"Ikh! Ikh!\" till the camel kneels. Hence the space called \"Barr al-Man\u00e1khah\" in Al-Medinah (Pilgrimage i. 222, ii. 91). There is a regular camel vocabulary amongst the Arabs, made up like our \"Gee\" (go ye!), etc. of significant words worn down.\n\n[FN#240] Arab. \"Laza,\" the Second Hell provided for Jews.\n\n[FN#241] The word has been explained (vol. i. 112).[see Volume 1, note 199] It is trivial, not occurring in the Koran which uses \"Arabs of the Desert ;\" \"Arabs who dwell in tents,\" etc. (chaps. ix. and xxxiii.). \"A'ar\u00e1bi\" is the classical word and the origin of \"Arab\" is disputed. According to Pocock (Not\u00e6 Spec. Hist. Arab.): \"Diverse are the opinions concerning the denomination of the Arabs; but the most certain of all is that which draws it from Arabah, which is part of the region of Tehama (belonging to Al-Medinah Pilgrimage ii. 118), which their father Ismail afterwards inhabited.\" Tehamah (sierra caliente) is the maritime region of Al Hijaz, the Moslems Holy Land; and its \"Arabah,\" a very small tract which named a very large tract, must not be confounded, as some have done, with the Wady Arabah, the ancient outlet of the Dead Sea. The derivation of \"Arab\" from \"Ya'arab\" a fancied son of Joktan is mythological. In Heb. Arabia may be called \"Eretz Ereb\" (or \"Arab\")=land of the West; but in Arabic \"Gharb\" (not Ereb) is the Occident and the Arab dates long before the Hebrew.\n\n[FN#242] \"When thine enemy extends his hand to thee, cut it off if thou can, or kiss it,\" wisely said Caliph al-Mansur.\n\n[FN#243] The Tartur was a peculiar turban worn by the Northern Arabs and shown in old prints. In modern Egypt the term is applied to the tall sugar-loaf caps of felt affected mostly by regular Dervishes. Burckhardt (Proverbs 194 and 398) makes it the high cap of felt or fur proper to the irregular cavalry called Dely or Delaty. In Dar For (Darfour) \"Tartur\" is a conical cap adorned with beads and cowries worn by the Manghwah or buffoon who corresponds with the Egyptian \"Khalb\u00fas\" or \"Maskharah\" and the Turkish \"Sutari.\" For an illustration see Plate iv. fig. 10 of Voyage au Darfour par Mohammed El Tounsy (The Tunisian), Paris, Duprat, 1845.\n\n[FN#244] The term is picturesque and true; we say \"gnaw,\" which is not so good.\n\n[FN#245] Here, meaning an Elder, a Chief, etc.; the word has been almost naturalised in English. I have noted that Abraham was the first \"Shaykh.\"\n\n[FN#246] This mention of weighing suggests the dust of Dean Swift and the money of the Gold Coast It was done, I have said, because the gold coin, besides being \"sweated\" was soft and was soon worn down.\n\n[FN#247] Fem. of N\u00e1j\u00ed (a deliverer, a saviour)=Salvadora.\n\n[FN#248] This, I have noted, is according to Koranic command (chaps. iv. 88). \"When you are saluted with a salutation, salute the person with a better salutation.\" The longer answer to \"Peace be with (or upon) thee! \" is still universally the custom. The \"Salem\" is so differently pronounced by every Eastern nation that the observant traveller will easily make of it a Shibboleth.\n\n[FN#249] The Badawi, who was fool as well as rogue, begins to fear that he has kidnapped a girl of family.\n\n[FN#250] These examinations being very indecent are usually done in strictest privacy. The great point is to make sure of virginity.\n\n[FN#251] This is according to strict Moslem law: the purchaser may not look at the girl's nakedness till she is his, and he ought to manage matters through an old woman.\n\n[FN#252] Lit. wrath; affliction which chokes; in Hindustani it means simply anger.\n\n[FN#253] i.e. Heaven forbid I be touched by a strange man.\n\n[FN#254] Used for fuel and other purposes, such as making \"doss stick.\"\n\n[FN#255] Arab \"Yaftah'Allah\" the offer being insufficient. The rascal is greedy as a Badaw and moreover he is a liar, which the Badawi is not.\n\n[FN#256] The third of the four great Moslem schools of Theology, taking its name from the Imam al-Sh\u00e1fi'\u00ed (Mohammed ibn Idr\u00eds) who died in Egypt A.H. 204, and lies buried near Cairo. (Sale's Prel. Disc. sect. viii.)\n\n[FN#257] The Moslem form of Cabbala, or transcendental philosophy of the Hebrews.\n\n[FN#258] Arab. \"Bakh\" the word used by the Apostle to Ali his son-in-law. It is the Latin \"Euge.\"\n\n[FN#259] Readers, who read for amusement, will do well to \"skip\" the fadaises of this highly educated young woman.\n\n[FN#260] There are three Persian Kings of this name (Artaxerxes)\nwhich means \"Flour and milk,\" or \"high lion.\" The text alludes to\nArdeshir Babegan, so called because he married the daughter of\nBabak the shepherd, founder of the Sassanides in A.D. 202. See\nD,Herberot, and the Dabistan.\n\n[FN#261] Alluding to the proverb, \"Folk follow their King's faith,\"\n\"Cujus regio ejus religio\" etc.\n\n[FN#262] Second Abbaside, A.H. 136-158 (=754-775).\n\n[FN#263] The celebrated companion of Mohammed who succeeded Abu Bakr in the Caliphate (A.H. 13-23=634-644). The Sunnis know him as Al-Adil the Just, and the Shiahs detest him for his usurpation, his austerity and harshness. It is said that he laughed once and wept once. The laugh was caused by recollecting how he ate his dough-gods (the idols of the Hanifah tribe) in The Ignorance. The tears were drawn by remembering how he buried alive his baby daughter who, while the grave was being dug, patted away the dust from his hair and beard. Omar was doubtless a great man, but he is one of the most ungenial figures in Moslem history which does not abound in genialities. To me he suggests a Puritan, a Covenanter of the sourest and narrowest type; and I cannot wonder that the Persians abhor him, and abuse him on all occasions.\n\n[FN#264] The austere Caliph Omar whose scourge was more feared than the sword was the - author of the celebrated saying \"Consult them (feminines) and do clear contrary-wise.\"\n\n[FN#265] Our \"honour amongst thieves.\"\n\n[FN#266] The sixth successor of Mohammed and founder of the Banu Umayyah or Ommiades, called the \"sons of the little mother\" from their eponymus (A.H. 41-60=661-680). For his Badawi wife Maysun, and her abuse of her husband, see Pilgrimage iii. 262.\n\n[FN#267] Shaykh of the noble tribe, or rather nation, Banu Tam\u00edm and a notable of the day, surnamed, no one knows why, \"Sire of the Sea.\"\n\n[FN#268] This is essential for cleanliness in hot lands: however much the bath may be used, the body-pile and lower hair, if submitted to a microscope, will show more or less sordes adherent. The axilla-hair is plucked because if shaved the growing pile causes itching and the depilatories are held deleterious. At first vellication is painful but the skin becomes used to it. The pecten is shaved either without or after using depilatories, of which more presently. The body-pile is removed by \"Takhf\u00edf\"; the Lib\u00e1n Sh\u00e1mi (Syrian incense), a fir- gum imported from Scio, is melted and allowed to cool in the form of a pledget. This is passed over the face and all the down adhering to it is pulled up by the roots (Burckhardt No. 420). Not a few Anglo-Indians have adopted these precautions\n\n[FN#269] This Caliph was a tall, fair, handsome man of awe-inspiring aspect. Omar used to look at him and say, \"This is the C\u00e6sar of the Arabs,\" while his wife called him a \"fatted ass.\"\n\n[FN#270] The saying is attributed to Abraham when \"exercised\" by the unkindly temper of Sarah; \"woman is made hard and crooked like a rib;\" and the modern addition is, \"whoso would straighten her, breaketh her.\"\n\n[FN#271] i.e. \"When ready and in erection.\"\n\n[FN#272] \"And do first (before going in to your wives) some act which may be profitable unto your souls\" or, for you: soul's good. (Koran, chaps. ii. 223.) Hence Ahnaf makes this prayer.\n\n[FN#273] It was popularly said that \"Truth-speaking left Omar without a friend.\" Entitled \"The Just\" he was murdered by Abu L\u00fal\u00faah, alias F\u00edr\u00faz, a (Magian ?) slave of Al-Magh\u00edrah for denying him justice.\n\n[FN#274] Governor of Bassorah under the first four Caliphs. See\nD'Herbelot s.v. \"Asch\u00e1ri.\"\n\n[FN#275] Ziyad bin Abi Sufyan, illegitimate brother of the Caliph\nMu'awiyah afterwards governor of Bassorah, Cufa and Al-Hijaz.\n\n[FN#276] The seditions in Kufah were mainly caused by the wilful nepotism of Caliph Othman bin As\u00e1kir which at last brought about his death. His main quality seems to have been personal beauty: \"never was seen man or woman of fairer face than he and he was the most comely of men:\" he was especially famed for beautiful teeth which in old age he bound about with gold wire. He is described as of middling stature, large- limbed, broad shouldered, fleshy of thigh and long in the fore-arm which was hairy. His face inclined to yellow and was pock-marked; his beard was full and his curly hair, which he dyed yellow, fell below his ears. He is called \"writer of the Koran\" from his edition of the M.S., and \"Lord of the two Lights\" because he married two of the Prophet's daughters, Rukayyah and Umm Kulthum; and, according to the Shi'ahs who call him Othman-i-Lang or\" limping Othman,\" he vilely maltreated them. They justify his death as the act of an Ijm\u00e1' al-Muslim\u00edn, the general consensus of Moslems which ratifies \"Lynch law.\" Altogether Othman is a mean figure in history.\n\n[FN#277] \"N\u00e1r\" (fire) is a word to be used delicately from its connection with Gehenna. You say, e.g. \"bring me a light, a coal (bassah)\" etc.; but if you say \"bring me fire! \" the enemy will probably remark \"He wanteth fire even before his time!\" The slang expression would be \"bring the sweet.\" (Pilgrimage i. 121.)\n\n[FN#278] Omar is described as a man of fair complexion, and very ruddy, but he waxed tawny with age, when he also became bald and grey. He had little hair on the cheeks but a long mustachio with reddish ends. In stature he overtopped the people and was stout as he was tall. A popular saying of Mohammed's is, \"All (very) long men are fools save Omar, and all (very) short men are knaves save Ali.\" The Persians, who abhor Omar, compare every lengthy, ungainly, longsome thing with him; they will say, \"This road never ends, like the entrails of Omar.\" We know little about Ali's appearance except that he was very short and stout, broad and full-bellied with a tawny complexion and exceedingly hairy, his long beard, white as cotton, filling all the space between his shoulders. He was a \"pocket. Hercules,\" and incredible tales, like that about the gates of Khaybar, are told of his strength. Lastly, he was the only Caliph who bequeathed anything to literature: his \"Cantiloquium\" is famous and he has left more than one mystical and prophetic work. See Ockley for his \"Sentences\" and D'Herbelot s. D. \"Ali\" and \"Gebr.\" Ali is a noble figure in Moslem history.\n\n[FN#279] The emancipation from the consequences of his sins; or it may mean a holy death.\n\n[FN#280] Battle fought near Al-Medinah A.D. 625. The word is derived from \"shad\" (one). I have described the site in my Pilgrimage, (vol. ii. 227).\n\n[FN#281] \"Haphsa\" in older writers; Omar's daughter and one of Mohammed's wives, famous for her connection with the manuscripts of the Koran. From her were (or claimed to be) descended the Hafsites who reigned in Tunis and extended their power far and wide over the Maghrib (Mauritania), till dispossessed by the Turks.\n\n[FN#282] i.e. humbly without the usual strut or swim: it corresponds with the biblical walking or going softly. (I Kings xxi. 27; Isaiah xxxviii. 15, etc.)\n\n[FN#283] A theologian of the seventh and eighth centuries.\n\n[FN#284] i.e. to prepare himself by good works, especially alms-giving, for the next world.\n\n[FN#285] A theologian of the eighth century.\n\n[FN#286] Abd al-Aziz was eighth Ommiade (regn. A.H. 99=717) and the fifth of the orthodox, famed for a piety little known to his house. His most celebrated saying was, \" Be constant in meditation on death: if thou bein straitened case 'twill enlarge it, and if in affluence 'twill straiten it upon thee.\" He died. poisoned, it is said, in A.H 101,\n\n[FN#287] Abu Bakr originally called Abd al-Ka'abah (slave of the Ka'abah) took the name of Abdullah and was surnamed Abu Bakr (father of the virgin) when Mohammed, who before had married only widows, took to wife his daughter, the famous or infamous Ayishah. \"Bikr\" is the usual form, but \"Bakr,\" primarily meaning a young camel, is metaphorically applied to human youth (Lane's Lex. s. c.). The first Caliph was a cloth-merchant, like many of the Meccan chiefs. He is described as very fair with bulging brow, deep set eyes and thin-checked, of slender build and lean loined, stooping and with the backs of his hands fleshless. He used tinctures of Henna and Katam for his beard. The Persians who hate him, call him \"Pir-i-Kaft\u00e1r,\" the old she-hyaena, and believe that he wanders about the deserts of Arabia in perpetual rut which the males must satisfy.\n\n[FN#288] The second, fifth, sixth and seventh Ommiades.\n\n[FN#289] The mother of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz was a granddaughter of\nOmar bin al-Khattab.\n\n[FN#290] Brother of this Omar's successor, Yezid II.\n\n[FN#291] So the Turkish proverb \"The fish begins to stink at the head.\"\n\n[FN#292] Calling to the slaves.\n\n[FN#293] When the \"Day of Arafat\" (9th of Z\u00fa'l-Hijjah) falls upon a Friday. For this Hajj al- Akbar see my Pilgrimage iii. 226. It is often confounded by writers (even by the learned M. Caussin de Perceval) with the common Pilgrimage as opposed to the Umrah, or \" Lesser Pilgrimage\" (ibid. iii. 342, etc.). The latter means etymologically cohabiting with a woman in her father's house as opposed to 'Ars or leading her to the husband's home: it is applied to visiting Meccah and going through all the pilgrim-rites but not at the Pilgrimage-season. Hence its title \"Hajj al-Asghar\" the \"Lesser Hajj.\" But \"Umrah\" is also applied to a certain ceremony between the hills Saf\u00e1 (a large hard rock) and Marwah (stone full of flints), which accompanies the Hajj and which I have described (ibid. iii. 344). At Meccah I also heard of two places called Al-Umrah, the Greater in the Wady F\u00e1timah and the Lesser half way nearer the city (ibid. iii. 344).\n\n[FN#294] A fair specimen of the unworthy egoism which all religious systems virtually inculcate Here a pious father leaves his children miserable to save his own dirty soul.\n\n[FN#295] Chief of the Ban\u00fa Tam\u00edn, one of the noblest of tribes, derived from Tam\u00edm, the uncle of Kuraysh (Koreish); hence the poets sang:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     There cannot be a son nobler than Kuraysh,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor an uncle nobler than Tam\u00edm.\n\nThe high minded Tam\u00edn is contrasted with the mean-spirited Kays, who also gave rise to a tribe; and hence the saying concerning one absolutely inconsistent, \"Art thou now Tam\u00edn and then Kays?\"\n\n[FN#296] Surnamed Al-Sakafi, Governor of Al-Yaman and Irak.\n\n[FN#297] Tenth Ommiade (regn. A H. 105-125 = 724-743).\n\n[FN#298] Or \"clothe thee in worn-out clothes\" i.e. \"Become a Fakir\" or religious mendicant.\n\n[FN#299] This gratuitous incest in ignorance injures the tale and is as repugnant to Moslem as to Christian taste.\n\n[FN#300] The child is named either on the day of its birth or on that day week. The father whispers it in the right ear, often adding the Az\u00e1n or prayer-call, and repeating in the left ear the \"Ik\u00e1mah\" or Friday sentence. There are many rules for choosing names according to the week-day, the ascendant planet, the \"Sortes Coranic\u00e6,\" etc.\n\n[FN#301] Amongst Moslems as amongst Christians there are seven deadly sins: idolatry, murder, falsely charging modest women with unchastity, robbing orphans, usury, desertion in Holy War and disobedience to parents. The difference between the two creeds is noteworthy. And the sage knows only three, intemperance, ignorance and egoism.\n\n[FN#302] Meaning, \"It was decreed by Destiny; so it came to pass,\" appropriate if not neat.\n\n[FN#303] The short, stout, dark, long-haired and two-bunched camel from \"Bukhtar\" (Bactria), the \"Eastern\" (Bakhtar) region on the Amu or Jayhun (Oxus) River; afterwards called Khorasan. The two-humped camel is never seen in Arabia except with northern caravans, and to speak of it would be a sore test of Badawi credulity.\n\n[FN#304] \"Kayl\u00falah\" is the \"forty-winks\" about noon: it is a Sunnat or Practice of the Prophet who said, \"Make the mid-day siesta, for verily at this hour the devils sleep not.\" \"Ayl\u00falain\" is slumbering after morning prayers (our \"beauty-sleep\"), causing heaviness andid leness: \"Ghayl\u00falah\" is dozing about 9 a.m. engendering poverty and wretchedness: \"Kayl\u00falah\" (with the guttural Kaf) is sleeping before evening prayers and \"Fayl\u00falah\" is slumbering after sunset\u2014both held to be highly detrimental. (Pilgrimage ii 49.)\n\n[FN#305] The Biblical \"Hamath\" (Hightown) too well known to require description. It is still famous for the water-wheels mentioned by al-Hariri (assembly of the Banu Har\u00e1m).\n\n[FN#306] When they say, \"The levee flashes bright on the hills of\nAl-Yaman,\" the allusion is to the south quarter, where\nsummer-lightning is seen. Al-Yaman (always with the article) means,\nI have said, the right-hand region to one facing the rising sun and\nAl-Sham (Syria) the left-hand region.\n[FN#307] Again \"he\" for \"she,\" in delicacy and jealousy of making public the beauty or conditions of the \"veiled sex.\" Even public singers would hesitate to use a feminine pronoun. As will be seen however, the rule is not invariably kept and hardly ever in Badawi poetry.\n\n[FN#308] The normal pun on \"Nuzhat al-Zaman\" = Delight of the Age or Time.\n\n[FN#309] The reader will find in my Pilgrimage (i. 305) a sketch of the Takht-rawan or travelling-litter, in which pilgrimesses are wont to sleep.\n\n[FN#310] In poetry it holds the place of our Zephyr; end the \"B\u00e1d- i-Sab\u00e1\"=Breeze o' the morn, Is much addressed by Persian poets.\n\n[FN#311] Here appears the nervous, excitable, hysterical Arab temperament which is almost phrensied by the neighbourhood of a home from which he had run away.\n\n[FN#312] Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman.\n\n[FN#313] The idea is essentially Eastern, \"A lion at home and a lamb abroad\" is the popular saying.\n\n[FN#314] Arab. \"Hubb al-Watan\" (= love of birthplace, patriotism) of which the Tradition says \"Min al-Im\u00e1n\" (=is part of man's religion).\n\n[FN#315] He is supposed to speak en prince; and he yields to a prayer when he spurns a command.\n\n[FN#316] In such caravans each party must keep its own place under pain of getting into trouble with the watchmen and guards.\n\n[FN#317] Mr. Payne (ii. 109) borrows this and the next quotation from the Bull Edit. i. 386.\n\n[FN#318] For the expiation of inconsiderate oaths see Koran (chaps. v.). I cannot but think that Al-Islam treats perjury too lightly: all we can say is-that it improves upon Hinduism which practically seems to leave the punishment to the gods.\n\n[FN#319] \"Kausar,\" as has been said, represents the classical nectar, the Amrita of the Hindus.\n\n[FN#320] From Bull Edit. i. 186. The couplet in the Mac. Edit. i. 457 is very wildly applied.\n\n[FN#321] The \"insula\" of Sancho Panza.\n\n[FN#322] This should have assured him that he stood in no danger.\n\n[FN#323] Here ends the wearisome tale of the brother and sister, and the romance of chivalry begins once more with the usual Arab digressions.\n\n[FN#324] I have derived this word from the Persian \"rang\"=colour, hue, kind.\n\n[FN#325] Otherwise all would be superseded, like U. S. officials under a new President.\n\n[FN#326] Arab. \"N\u00edmshah\" from the Pers. N\u00edmchah, a \"half-sword,\" a long dagger worn in the belt. Richardson derives it from Namsh, being freckled (damasked).\n\n[FN#327] The Indian term for a tent large enough to cover a troop of cavalry.\n\n[FN#328] Arab. \"Marh\u00fam\" a formula before noticed. It is borrowed from the Jewish, \"of blessed memory\" (after the name of the honoured dead, Prov. x. 17.); with the addition of \"upon whom be peace,\" as opposed to the imprecation, \"May the name of the wicked rot!\"\n\n[FN#329] The speeches of the five damsels should be read only by students.\n\n[FN#330] i.e. Those who look for \"another and a better.\"\n\n[FN#331] The title of Caliph Abu Bakr because he bore truthful witness to the Apostle's mission or, others say, he confirmed the \"Mi'r\u00e1j\" or nocturnal journey to Heaven.\n\n[FN#332] All this is Koranic (chaps. ii., etc.).\n\n[FN#333] This may have applied more than once to \"hanging judges\" in the Far West.\n\n[FN#334] A traditionist and jurisconsult of Al-Medinah in the seventh and eighth centuries.\n\n[FN#335] The Alexander of the Koran and Eastern legends, not to be confounded with the Alexander of Macedon.

I (and verse 8 follows). The Archangel Gabriel is supposed to address Mohammed and not a few divines believe this Surah (chapter) to have been first revealed. Mr. Rodwell makes it No. ii. following the Fatrah or silent interval which succeeded No. xcvi. \"Clots of Blood.\" See his 2nd Edit. p. 3 for further details.\n\n[FN#342] i.e. dangerous to soul-health.\n\n[FN#343] In the Mac. Edit. \"Abd\" for \"Sa'id.\" The latter was a black and a native of Cufa during the first century (A.H ) and is still famous as a traditionist.\n\n[FN#344] Arab. \"Shirk,\" giving a partner to Allah, attending chiefly to Christians and idolaters and in a minor degree to Jews and Guebres. We usually English it by \"polytheism,\" which is clumsy and conveys a wrong idea\n\n[FN#345] Grandson of the Caliph Ali. He is one of the Imams\n(High-priests) of the Shi'ah school.\n\n[FN#346] An eminent traditionist of the eighth century (A.D.).\n\n[FN#347] The prayers of the Fast-month and Pilgrimage-month are often said in especial places outside the towns and cities; these are the Indian Id(Eed-)g\u00e1h. They have a screen of wall about a hundred yards long with a central prayer-niche and the normal three steps for the preacher; and each extremity is garnished with an imitation minaret. They are also called Nam\u00e1z-gah and one is sketched by Herklots (Plate iii. fig. 2). The object of the trips thither in Zu'l-Ka'adah and Zu'l-Hijjah is to remind Moslems of the \"Ta'ar\u00edf,\" or going forth from Meccah to Mount Arafat.\n\n[FN#348] Arab. \"Al-H\u00e1fi,\" which in Egyptian means sore-footed as well. He was an ascetic of the eighth and ninth centuries (A.D.). He relates a tradition of the famous soldier saint Kh\u00e1lid bin Wal\u00edd who lies buried like the poet Ka'ab al-Ahb\u00e1r near Hums (Emessa) once the Botia, Phrygia, Abdera, Suabia of Syria now Halbun (pronounced Halb\u00e1un) near Damascus. I cannot explain how this Kuraysh noble (a glorious figure in Moslem history) is claimed by the Afghans as one of their countrymen and made to speak Pukhtu or Pushtu, their rough old dialect of Persian. The curious reader will consult my Pilgrimage iii. 322 for the dialogue between Mohammed and Khalid. Again there is general belief in Arabia that the English sent a mission to the Prophet, praying that Khalid might be despatched to proselytise them: unfortunately Mohammed was dead and the \"Ingr\u00edz\" ratted. It is popularly held that no armed man can approach Khalid's grave; but I suppose my revolver did not count.\n\n[FN#349] When he must again wash before continuing prayer.\n\n[FN#350] Bin Adham; another noted ascetic of the eighth century.\nThose curious about these unimportant names will consult the great\nBiographical Dictionary of Ibn Khallikan, translated by Baron\nMacGuckin de Slane (1842-45).\n\n[FN#351] Thus making Bishr the \"Im\u00e1m\" (artistes) lit. one who stands in front. In Koran xvii. 74 it means \"leader\": in ii. 118 Allah makes Abraham an \"Imam to mankind.\"\n\n[FN#352] A favourite sentiment in the East: we find it at the very beginning of Sa'di's Gulistan: better a weal-bringing lie than a harm-dealing truth.\n\n[FN#353] A penny, one sixth of the drachma.\n\n[FN#354] Founder of the Hanbali, fourth (in date) of the four orthodox Moslem schools. The Caliph al-Mu'atasim bi'llah, son of Harun al-Rashid, who believed the Koran to have been created and not a Logos (whatever that may be), co-eternal with Allah, scourged this Imam severely for \"differing in opinion\" (A.H. 220=833). In fact few of the notable reverends of that day escaped without a caress of the scourge or the sword.\n\n[FN#355] A learned man of the eighth century at Bassorah (A.D.).\n\n[FN#356] A traditionist of Khorasan in the ninth century (A.D.).\n\n[FN#357] \"Azal,\" opp. to \"Abad,\" eternity without end, infinity.\n\n[FN#358] Koran lxvi. 6.\n\n[FN#359] A traditionist of Al-Medinah, eighth century (A.D.).\n\n[FN#360] Arab. \"M\u00fas\u00e1\": the Egyptian word was \"Mesu,\" the \"child\" or the \"boy\" (brought up in the palace?), and the Hebrews made it \"Mosheh\" or \"one drawn out of the water;\" \"Mu\" in Egypt being water, the Arab \"Ma\"; whence probably the moderns have derived the dim. \"Moyeh ,\" vulg. Egyptian for water.\n\n[FN#361] Koran, chaps. xxviii.: Shu'ayb is our Jethro: Koran, chaps. vii. and xi. Mr. Rodwell suggests (p. 101) that the name has been altered from Hobab (Numb. x. 29).\n\n[FN#362] Arab. \"Taub\" (Saub), the long shirt popularly written in English Tobe and pronounced so by Egyptians. It is worn by both sexes (Lane, M. E. chaps. i. \"Tob\") in Egypt, and extends into the heart of Moslem Africa: I can compare it with nothing but a long nightgown dyed a dirty yellow by safflower and about as picturesque as a carter's smock-frock.\n\n[FN#363] There is nothing of this in the Koran; and it is a most unhappy addition, as Moses utterly and pretentiously ignored a \"next world.\"\n\n[FN#364] Koran xxviii. 22-27. Mohammed evidently confounded the contract between Laban and Jacob. (Gen. xxix. 15-39.)\n\n[FN#365] So says Al-Hariri (Ass. of Sasan), \"The neighbour before the house and the traveller before the journey.\" In certain cities the neighbourhood is the real detective police, noting every action and abating scandals (such as orgies, etc.) with a strong hand and with the full consent of public opinion and of the authorities. This loving the neighbour shows evident signs of being borrowed from Christianity.\n\n[FN#366] Al-Asamm a theologian of Balkh, ninth century (A.D.).\n\n[FN#367] The founder of the Senior School, for which see Sale Prel.\nDisc. sect. viii.\n\n[FN#368] Thus serving the Lord by sinning against his own body.\n\n[FN#369] An Egyptian doctor of the law (ninth century).\n\n[FN#370] Koran lxxvii. 35, 36. This is one of the earliest and most poetical chapters of the book.\n\n[FN#371] Abu Hanifah was scourged for refusing to take office and was put to death in prison, it is said by poison (A.H. 150=A.D. 767), for a judicial sentence authorising rebellion against the second Abbaside, Al-Mansur, surnamed Abu'l-Daw\u00e1nik (Father of Pence) for his exceeding avarice.\n\n[FN#372] \"L\u00e1 rayba f\u00ed-hi\" says the Koran (ii. 1) of itself; and the saying is popularly applied to all things of the Faith.\n\n[FN#373] Arab. \"Riv\u00e1l al-Ghayb,\" somewhat like the \"Himalayan Brothers\" of modern superstition. See Herklots (Qanoon-e-Islam) for a long and careful description of these \"Mard\u00e1n-i-Ghayb\" (Pers.), a \"class of people mounted on clouds,\" invisible, but moving in a circular orbit round the world, and suggesting the Hindu \"Lokap\u00e1las.\" They should not be in front of the traveller nor on his right, but either behind or on his left hand. Hence tables, memorial couplets and hemistichs are required to ascertain the station, without which precaution journeys are apt to end badly.\n\n[FN#374] A sweetmeat before noticed.\n\n[FN#375] Door hinges in the east are two projections for the top and bottom of the leaf playing in hollows of the lintel and threshold. It appears to be the primitive form, for we find it in the very heart of Africa. In the basaltic cities of the Hauran, where the doors are of thick stone, they move easily on these pins. I found them also in the official (not the temple)City of Palmyra, but all broken.\n\n[FN#376] The effect of the poison and of the incantation which accompanied it.\n\n[FN#377] King Omar who had raped her. My sympathies are all with the old woman who nightly punished the royal lecher.\n\n[FN#378] Arab. \"Zunn\u00e1r,\" the Gr. . Christians and Jews were compelled by the fanatical sumptuary laws of the Caliph Al- Mutawakkil (AD. 856) to wear a broad leather belt in public, hence it became a badge of the Faith. Probably it was confounded with the \"Janeo\" (Brahmanical thread) and the Parsi sacred girdle called Kashti. (Dabistan i, 297, etc.). Both Mandeville and La Brocqui\u00e8re speak of \"Christians of the Girdle, because they are all girt above,\" intending Jacobites or Nestorians.\n\n[FN#379] \"Sil\u00e1h d\u00e1r\" (Arab. and Pers.)=a military officer of high rank; literally an \"armour-bearer,\" chosen for velour and trustworthiness. So Jonathan had a \"young man\" (brave) who bare his armour (I Sam. xiv. 1, 6 and 7); and Goliath had a man that bare the shield before him (ibid. xvii. 7, 41). Men will not readily forget the name of Sulayman Agha, called the Silahdar, in Egypt. (Lane M. E. chaps. iv.)\n\n[FN#380] It will be told afterwards.\n\n[FN#381] The elder brother thus showed himself a vassal and proved himself a good Moslem by not having recourse to civil war.\n\n[FN#382] Arab. \"Ghazwah,\" the corrupt Gallicism, now\nEuropeanised=raid, foray.\n[FN#383] Turk in modern parlance means a Turkoman, a pomade: the settled people call themselves Osmanli or Othmanli. Turkoman=Turk- like.\n\n[FN#384] Arab. \"Nims\u00e1;\" southern Germans, Austrians; from the Slav. \"Nemica\" (any Germans), literally meaning \"The dumb\" (nemac), because they cannot speak Slav.\n\n[FN#385] Arab. \"Dub\u00e1r\u00e1\" from the Slav. \"Dubrovnik,\" from \"Dub\" (an oak) and \"Dubrava\" (an oak forest). Ragusa, once a rival of Venice, gave rise to the word \"Argosy.\" D'Herbelot calls it \"Dobravenedik\" or \"Good Venice,\" the Turkish name, because it paid tribute when Venice would not (?).\n\n[FN#386] Arab. \"Jawarnah,\" or, \"J\u00farnah\" evidently Zara, a place of many names, Jadera (Hirtius de Bell. Alex. cap. 13), Jadra, Zadra (whence the modern term), Diadora, Diadosca and Jadrossa. This important Liburnian city sent forth many cruisers in crusading days; hence the Arabs came to know its name.\n\n[FN#387] Arab. \"Banu'l-Asfar;\" which may mean \"Pale faces,\" in the sense of \"yeller girls\" (New Orleans) and that intended by North American Indians, or, possibly, the peoples with yellow (or rather tow-coloured) hair we now call Russians. The races of Hindostan term the English not \"white men,\" but \"red men;\" and the reason will at once be seen by comparing a Britisher with a high-caste N\u00e1gar Brahman whose face is of parchment colour as if he had drunk exsangue cuminum. The Yellow-faces of the text correspond with the Sansk. \"Svetadvipa\"\u2014Whiteman's Land.\n\n[FN#388] Arab. \"Al-Musakhkham.\" No Moslem believes that Isa was crucified and a favourite fancy is that Judas, changed to the likeness of Jesus, thus paid for his treason. (Evangel. Barnab\u00e6.) Hence the resurrection is called not \"Kiy\u00e1mah\" but \"Kum\u00e1mah\"=rubbish. This heresy about the Cross they share with the Docetes, \"certain beasts in the shape of men\" (says Ignatius), who held that a phantom was crucified. So far the Moslems are logical, for \"Isa,\" being angelically, miraculously and immaculately conceived, could not be; but they contradict themselves when they hold a vacant place near Mohammed's tomb for the body of Isa after his second coming as a forerunner to Mohammed and Doomday. (Pilgrimage ii. 89.)\n\n[FN#389] A diviner, priest, esp. Jewish, and not belonging to the tribe of Levi.\n\n[FN#390] Again the coarsest word \"Khara.\" The allusion is to the\nvulgar saying, \"Thou eatest skite!\" (i.e. thou talkest nonsense).\nDecent English writers modify this to, \"Thou eatest dirt:\" and Lord\nBeaconsfield made it ridiculous by turning it into \"eating sand.\"\n[FN#391] These silly scandals, which cause us only to smile, excite\nEasterns to fury. I have seen a Moslem wild with rage on hearing a\nChristian parody the opening words of the Koran, \"Bismillahi 'l-\nRahm\u00e1ni 'l-Rah\u00edm, Mismish wa Kamar al-din,\" roughly translated,\n\n\"In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate! Apricots and marmalede.\" The idea of the Holy Merde might have been suggested by the Hindus: see Mandeville, of the archiprotopapaton (prelate) carrying ox-dung and urine to the King, who therewith anoints his brow and breast, &c. And, incredible to relate, this is still practiced after a fashion by the Parsis, one of the most progressive and the sharpest witted of Asiatic races.\n\n[FN#392] Meaning that he had marked his brow with a cross (of ashes?) as certain do on Ash Wednesday.\n\n[FN#393] Syria, the \"left-hand land\" as has before been explained. The popular saying about its people is \"Sh\u00e1mi sh\u00fami!\"\u2014the Syrian is small potatoes (to render the sense Americanic\u00e8). Nor did Syrus, the slave in Roman days, bear the best of names. In Al-Hijaz the Syrian is addressed \"Ab\u00fa Sh\u00e1m\" (Father of Syria) and insulted as \"Abuser of the Salt\" (a traitor). Yet many sayings of Mohammed are recorded in honour of Syria, and he sometimes used Syriac words. Such were \"Bakh, bakh\" (=euge, before noticed), and \"Kakh,\" a congener of the Latin Cacus and Caca which our day has docked to \"cack.\" (Pilgrimage iii. 115)\n\n[FN#394] Koran xiv. 34. \"They (Unbelievers) shall be thrown therein (i.e., the House of Perdition=Hell); and an unhappy dwelling shall it be.\"\n\n[FN#395] The leg-cut is a prime favourite with the Eastern Sworder, and a heavy two-handed blade easily severs a horse's leg.\n\n[FN#396] Mohammed repeatedly declared (Koran lxi.) that the Christians had falsified the passage (\"I go to my Father and the Paraclete shall come,\" John xvi. 7) promising the advent of the Comforter, (ibid. xiv. 20; xv. 26) by substituting the latter word for glorious, renowned, i.e., Ahmed or Mohammed=the praised one. This may have been found in the Arabic translation of the Gospels made by Warakah, cousin to Mohammed's first wife; and hence in Koran lxi. we find Jesus prophesying of an Apostle \"whose name shall be Ahmad.\" The word has consequently been inserted into the Arabic Gospel of Saint Barnabas (Dabistan iii. 67). Moslems accept the Pentateuch, the Psalter and the Gospel; but assert (Koran, passim.) that all extant copies have been hopelessly corrupted, and they are right. Moses, to whom the Pentateuch is attributed, notices his own death and burial\u2014\"the mair the miracle,\" said the old Scotch lady. The \"Psalms of David\" range over a period of some five hundred years, and there are three Isaiahs who pass with the vulgar for one. The many apocryphal Gospels, all of which have been held genuine and canonical at different times and in different places, prove that the four, which are still in use, were retained because they lack the manifest absurdities of their discarded rivals.\n\n[FN#397] Arab. \" Labbayka; \" the Pilgrimage-cry (Night xxii.) which in Arabic is,\n\nLabbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!\nL\u00e1 Shar\u00edka lake, Labbayk'!\nInna 'l-hamda w'al ni'amata lake wa'l mulk!\nLabbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!\n\nSome add \"Here am I, and I honour Thee, the son of Thy two slaves; beneficence and good are all between Thy hands.\"With the \"Talbiyah\" the pilgrims should bless the Prophet, pray Allah to grant Heaven and exclaim, \"By Thy mercy spare us from the pains of Hell-fire!\" (Pilgrimage iii. 232.) Labbayka occurs in the verses attributed to Caliph Ali; so labba=he faced, and yalubbu=it faces (as one house faces another); lastly, he professed submission to Allah; in which sense, together with the verbal noun \"Talbiyah,\" it is used by Al- Hanri (Pref. and Ass. of Su'adah).\n\n[FN#398] Arab. \"Kiss\u00eds\" (plur. Kus\u00fas) from .\n\n[FN#399] Koran ii. The \"red cow\" is evidently the \"red heifer\" of\nBarnabas, chaps. vii.\n\n[FN#400] Arab. \"Al-J\u00e1sal\u00edk\"= .\n\n[FN#401] This is from the first \"Gospel of Infancy,\" wherein Jesus said to his mother, \"Verily I am Jesus, the Son of God, the Word which thou hast brought forth, as the Angel Gabriel did declare unto thee; and my Father hath sent me to save the world\" (chaps. i. 2.). The passage is virtually quoted in the Koran (chaps. iii. 141), of course omitting \" the Son of God\"\n\n[FN#402] Mohammed allowed his locks to grow down to his ear-lobes but never lower.\n\n[FN#403] Arab. \"Lis\u00e1m\" I have explained as a covering for the lower face, made by drawing over it the corner of the head-kerchief (Pilgrimage i. 346). The Lis\u00e1m of the African Taw\u00e1rik hoods the eyes so that a man must turn up his face to see, and swathes all the lower half, leaving only the nose exposed. And this is worn by many men by night as well as by day, doubtless to avoid the evil eye. The native Sultans of Darfur, like those of Bornu and others further west, used white muslin as a face-wrap: hence, too, the ceremonies when spitting, etc., etc. The K\u00fafiyah or head-kerchief of the Arabs soon reached Europe and became in Low Latin Cuphia; in Spanish Escofia; in Ital. Cuffia or Scuffia; in French Escoffion, Scofion (Reine Marguerite) Co\u00ebffe (une pellicule, marque de bonheur) Coiffe and Coife, &c.; the Scotch Curch or Coif, opposed to the maiden snood, and, lastly our Sergeant-at-Law's Coif. Littr\u00e9, the Learned, who in erudition was n\u00e9 coiff\u00e9, has missed this obvious derivation.\n\n[FN#404] \"Cutting,\" throughout the book, alludes to the scymitar with which Arabs never give point; and \"thrusting\" to the footman's spear and the horseman's lance.\n\n[FN#405] A popular phrase, I repeat, for extreme tenor and consternation.\n\n[FN#406] The name usually applies to a well-known district and city of Al Yaman, where \"Koss the eloquent\" was bishop in Mohammed's day: the Negiran of D'Herbelot. Here, however, it is the Syrian Najr\u00e1n (Nejr\u00e2n of Missionary Porter's miserable Handbook), now a wretched village near the volcanic Lajj\u00e1, about one hundred and twenty miles direct south of Damascus and held by Druzes and Christians.\n\n[FN#407] The Kant\u00e1r (quintal) of 100 ratls (Ibs.) =98-99 Ibs. avoir.\n\n[FN#408] Arab. \"Jur\u00e1b (bag) mi'adat- ih (of his belly),\" the \"curdling of the testicles\" in fear is often mentioned.\n\n[FN#409] Clearly alluding to the magic so deeply studied by medi\u00e6val Jews.\n\n[FN#410] Arab. \"Sah\u00e1kah,\" lit. rubbing. The Moslem Harem is a great school for this \"Lesbian (which I would call Atossan) love \"; but the motive of the practice lies deeper. As amongst men the mixture of the feminine with the masculine temperament leads to sodomy, so the reverse makes women prefer their own sex. These tribades are mostly known by peculiarities of form and features, hairy cheeks and upper lips, gruff voices, hircine odour and the large projecting clitoris with erectile powers known to the Arabs as \"bazar\" hence Tabz\u00edr=circumcision or amputation of such clitoris. Burckhardt (Prov. 436) translates \" Bazarah\" by slut or wench. He adds \" it originally signifies the labia which the Cairenes also entice Zamb\u00far and which are cut off in girlhood.\" See also Lane, Lex. s.v.; Tabz\u00edr. Both writers confuse excision of the nymph\u00e6 with circumcision of the clitoris (Zamb\u00far) Al-Siy\u00fati (Kitab al-Iz\u00e1' fi'Ilm al-Nikah) has a very interesting chapter on Sapphic venery, which is well known to Europe as proved by such works as \"Gamiani,\" and \"Anandria ou Confessions de Mademoiselle Sappho, avec la Clef,\" Lesbos, 1718. Onanism is fatally prevalent: in many Harems and girls' schools tallow candles and similar succedanea are vainly forbidden and bananas when detected are cut into four so as to be useless; of late years, however, China has sent some marvellous artificial phalli of stuffed bladder, horn and even caoutchouc, the latter material of course borrowed from Europe.\n\n[FN#411] This is considered a powerful aphrodisiac in the East. Hence male devotees are advised to avoid tile \"two reds,\" i.e. meat and wine; while the \"two reds,\" which corrupt women, are gold and saffron, that is perfumery. Hence also the saying of Mohammed:\u2014 \"Perfumes for men should have scent and not colour; for women should have colour and not scent.\" (Mishk\u00e1t al-Mas\u00e1b\u00edh ii. 361.)\n\n\n[FN#412] These are the \"Hib\u00e1s\" or thin cords of wool which the\nBadawi binds round his legs, I believe to keep off cramp.\n(Pilgrimage iii. 78).\n\n[FN#413] Crying out \"La il\u00e1ha illa 'llah.\" (There is no god but the\nGod.); technically called \"Tahl\u00edl.\"\n\n[FN#414] i.e. Men, angels and devils, the \"Triloka\" (triple people) of the Hindus. Alam\u00edn (plur.), never Alamayn (dual), is the Triregno denoted by the papal Tiara, the three Christian kingdoms being Heaven, Hell and Purgatory.\n\n[FN#415] Matrahinna or Mit-Rahinah is a well-known village near Memphis, the name being derived from the old Egyptian Minat-ro- hinnu, the port at the mouth of the canal. Let me remark that two of these three words, \"Minat\" and \"Ru,\" are still common in \" Aryan\" Persian.\n\n[FN#416] Kir\u00e1mat, a sign, a prodigy, opposed to Mu'ujizah, a miracle wrought by a prophet. The Sufis explain this thaumaturgy by Allah changing something of Nature's ordinary course in favour of an especial worshipper, and, after a fashion, this is Catholic doctrine (See Dabistan, iii. 173).\n\n[FN#417] Koran, x. 25, \"until the earth receive its vesture and be adorned with various plants.\"\n\n[FN#418] i.e. the young hair sprouting on the boy's cheek.\n\n[FN#419] A fighter for the faith and now a title which follows the name, e.g. Osm\u00e1n P\u00e1sh\u00e1 Gh\u00e1z\u00ed, whom the English press dubbed \"Ghazi Osman.\"\n\n[FN#420] That is the King of Constantinople.\n\n[FN#421] Cassia fistularis, a kind of carob: \" Shambar\" is the\nArab. form of the Persian \" Chambar.\"\n\n[FN#422] Koran, ii. 149. Hence the vulgar idea that Martyrs are still alive in the flesh. See my Pilgrimage (ii. 110 and elsewhere) for the romantic and picturesque consequences of that belief. The Commentators (Jal\u00e1l al-D\u00edn, etc.) play tricks with the Koranic words, \" they (martyrs) are not dead but living\" (iii. 179) by placing the happy souls in the crops of green birds which eat of the fruits and drink of the waters of Paradise; whereas the reprobates and the (very) wicked are deposited in black birds which drain the sanies and the boiling waters of Hell. Amongst the Greeks a body remaining entire long after death suggests Anathema Maranatha: it is the contrary with Catholic Christians (Boccaccio iv. 5, of the Pot of Basil). Concerning this creed see Maundrell, Letter of 1698.\n\n[FN#423] Tor is \"Mount Sinai\" in the Koran (xcv. 1). I have only to repeat my opinion concerning the present site so called: \"It is evident that Jebel Serbal dates only from the early days of Coptic Christianity; that Jebel Musa, its Greek rival, rose after the visions of Helena in the fourth century; whilst the building of the Convent by Justinian belongs to A.D 527. Ras Safs\u00e1fah, its rival to the north, is an affair of yesterday, and may be called the invention of Robinson; and Jebel Katerina, to the south is the property of R\u00fcppell\" (Midian Revisited i., 237). I would therefore call the \"Sinaitic\" Peninsula, Peninsula of Paran in old days and Peninsula of Tor (from its chief port) in our time. It is still my conviction that the true Mount Sinai will be found in Jabal Ar\u00e1if, or some such unimportant height to the north of the modern Hajj- road from Suez to Akabah. Even about the name (which the Koran writes \"Sain\u00e1\" and \"S\u00edn\u00edn\") there is a dispute: It is usually derived from the root \"Sanah\"=sentis, a bush; but this is not satisfactory. Our eminent Assyriologist, Professor Sayce, would connect it with \"Sin,\" the Assyrian Moon- god as Mount Nebo with the Sun-god and he expects to find there the ruins of a Lunar temple as a Solar fane stands on Ba'al Zapuna (Baal Zephon) or the classical Mount Casius.\n\n[FN#424] Alluding to the miracle of Aaron's rod (the gift of Jethro) as related in the Koran (chapts. vii. 1., xx., etc.), where the Egyptian sorcerers threw down thick ropes which by their magic twisted and coiled like serpents.\n\n[FN#425] Arab. \"Ay\u00e1t\" lit. \"signs,\" here \"miracles of the truth,\" 1. c. Koranic versets as opposed to chapters. The ranks of the enemy represent the latter, sword-cuts the former\u2014a very persuasive mode of preaching.\n\n[FN#426] Lane (M. E. chapt.. iii.) shows by a sketch the position of the worshipper during this \"Sal\u00e1m\" which is addressed, some say, to the guardian angels, others suppose to all brother-believers and angels.\n\n[FN#427] i.e., where the Syrians found him.\n\n[FN#428] i.e., Dedianus Arabised; a name knightly and plebian.\n\n[FN#429] In such tales the Wazir is usually the sharp-witted man, contrasting with the \"dummy,\" or master.\n\n[FN#430] Carrier-pigeons were extensively used at this time. The Caliph Al-N\u00e1sir li-D\u00edni ll\u00e1h (regn. A.H. 575=1180) was, according to Ibn Khald\u00fan, very fond of them. The moderns of Damascus still affect them. My successor, Mr. Consul Kirby Green, wrote an excellent report on pigeon-fancying at Damascus. The so-called Maundeville or Mandeville in A. D. 1322 speaks of carrier-pigeons in Syria as a well-known mode Of intercourse between lord and lord.\n\n[FN#431] Mohammed who declared \"There is no monkery in Al-Islam,\" and who virtually abolished the priest, had an especial aversion to the shaveling (Ruhb\u00e1n). But the \"Gens \u00e6terna in qu\u00e2 nemo nascitur\" (Pliny v. 17) managed to appear even in Al-lslam, as Fakirs,, Dervishes, S\u00fafis, etc. Of this more hereafter.\n\n[FN#432] i.e. her holiness would act like a fascinating talisman.\n\n[FN#433] The \"smoking out\" practice is common amongst the Arabs: hence Marshal Pelissier's so- called \" barbarity.\" The Public is apt to forget that on a campaign the general's first duty is to save his own men by any practice which the laws of fair warfare do not absolutely forbid.\n\n[FN#434] i.e. Mohammed, who promised Heaven and threatened Hell.\n\n[FN#435] Arab. \"Ahr\" or \"ihr,\" fornication or adultery, i.e., irreligion, infidelity as amongst the Hebrews (Isaiah xxiii.17).\n\n[FN#436] A sign of defeat.\n\n[FN#437] In English \"last night\": I have already noted that the Moslem day, like the Jewish and the Scandinavian, begins at sundown; and \"layl \" a night, is often used to denote the twenty- four hours between sunset and sunset, whilst \"yaum,\" a day, would by us be translated in many cases \"battle-day.\"\n\n[FN#438] Iterum the \"Himalayan Brothers.\"\n\n[FN#439] Again, Mohammed who promised Good to the Good, and vice vers\u00e2.\n\n[FN#440] They are sad doggrel like most of the pi\u00e8ces d'occasion inserted in The Nights.\n\n[FN#441] Here \"Kahwah\" (coffee) is used in its original sense of strong old wine. The derivation is \"Akh\u00e1\"=fastidire fecit, causing disinclination for food, the Matambre (kill- hunger) of the Iberians. In old days the scrupulous called coffee \"Kihwah\" in order to distinguish it from 'Kakwah,\" wine.\n\n[FN#442] i.e. Mohammed, a common title.\n\n[FN#443] That is, fatal to the scoffer and the impious.\n\n[FN#444] Equivalent to our \"The Devil was sick,\" etc.\n\n[FN#445] i.e. to the enemy: the North American Indians (so called) use similar forms of \"inverted speech\"; and the Australian aborigines are in no way behind them.\n\n[FN#446] See Vol. i., p. 154 (Night xvi.).\n\n[FN#447] Arab. \"Sauf,\" a particle denoting a near future whereas\n\"Sa-\" points to one which may be very remote.\n\n[FN#448] From the root \"Shanh\"=having a fascinating eye, terrifying. The Irish call the fascinater \"eybitter\" and the victim (who is also rhymed to death) \"eybitten.\"\n\n[FN#449] i.e., not like the noble-born, strong in enduring the stress of fight.\n\n[FN#450] i.e., of Abraham. For the Well Zemzem and the Place of Abraham see my Pilgrimage (iii. 171-175, etc.), where I described the water as of salt-bitter taste, like that of Epsom (iii. 203). Sir William Muir (in his excellent life of Mahomet, I. cclviii.) remarks that \"the flavour of stale water bottled up for months would not be a criterion of the same water freshly drawn;\" but soldered tins-full of water drawn a fortnight before are to be had in Calcutta and elsewhere after Pilgrimage time; and analysis would at once detect the salt.\n\n[FN#451] Racing was and is a favourite pastime with those hippomanists, the Arabs; but it contrasts strongly with our civilised form being a trial of endurance rather than of speed. The Prophet is said to have limited betting in these words, \"There shall be no wagering save on the Kuff (camel's foot), the Hafir (hoof of horse, ass, etc.) or the Nasal (arrow-pile or lance head).\"\n\n[FN#452] In the Mac.

Much of this story is from the Talmud (Abodah Sar. 2, 2, Tract Sabbath, etc.) whence Al-Islam borrowed so much of its Judaism, as it took Christianity from the Apocryphal New Testament. This tradition is still held by the Israelites, says Mr. Rodwell (p. 333) who refers it to a misunderstanding of Exod. xix. 17, rightly rendered in the E. version \"at the nether part of the mountain.\"\n\n[FN#457] Arab. \"Azgh\u00e1n\" = the camel-litters in which women travel.\n\n[FN#458] i.e. to joy foes and dismay friends.\n\n[FN#459] Whose eyes became white (i.e. went blind) with mourning for his son Joseph (Koran, chaps. xii. 84).

really terrific and quite scientific\nAnd I'm half stoned\nFor breakfast some cornflakes and vodka\nBut cornflakes have carbohydrate;\nSo I don't eat those fattening cornflakes\nI eat the vodka straight\nDrink, drink, everyone drink;\nIt's not as bad as we used to think\nWith every Manhattan your stomach will flatten\nSo drink, drink, drink\nThe Air Force invented this diet\nA fact which they hotly deny\nOf course they deny it, 'cause this is the diet\nThat got the Air Force high\nFor lunch you can have three martinis\nWhat better lunch is there than that?\nBut caution: do not eat the olives\n'Cause olives make you fat\nDrink, drink, everyone drink;\nIt's not as bad as we used to think\nIf pounds you would burn off, then turn on your Smirnoff\nAnd drink, drink, drink\nFor dinner, a nice Scotch and soda\nNow that oughtta help you to lose\nNo whipped cream, no butter, just lay in the gutter\nAnd booze, booze, booze\nSuppose you should meet a policeman\nWho says you've been quenching your thirst;\nYou just tell him it's physical fitness\nAnd health comes first!\nDrink (hic!), drink (hic!), booze everywhere (hic!);\nPass that decanter of bourbon there\nI'm fatter than ever, but here's what's so clever:\nI don't care!You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2127795", "artist_names": "Little Richard", "full_title": "I

over\n\nLooks as if your eggs are all rotten\nAnd now is the time to rely\nOn the spellbinder's hat and his magic\nBlue tie as our oceans run dry\nThe first day's when you'll get your toothbrush back\nAnd the second one's made to compare\nAs you put the lotion in your backpack\nI am already there\nThere's no longer no one asking your name\nAt the beach house grill on the fourth floor\nAnd when you go out for a swim\nYou'll probably leave that face indoors\nLooks like the eggs are ready hatched now\nAnd like you chose wrong when you went for tails\nBut how am I to forget you're

Kathy Bates\u205fand also Betty White\nAll the people, if you're the type\nI wanna say that you're equal on the mic\nBut nobody's equal to me\nNobody is coming for my neck\nI am looking for respect\nI'm not looking for a check\nUnless it is for my friends\nThat's why we're doing this\nTo make some pennies\nAnd maybe make amends\nSailors in the sea might get the bends\nThat is my fuckin' dream\nTo go with James Cameron in a submarine\nTo the bottom of the ocean\nRocking forth with the motion\nMe and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion\nSharing our emotion\nDaring you to fuck with us\nAt the sea, at a deep water vent\nBut we don't got the bends, we're not bent\nI think that's what I'm meant to do\nMe and my crew\nGigantic, looking to cross the sea\nFor the Titanic\nOh shit, you mean they found it?\nAlready? They'd abounded with treasure?\nMan, that doesn't give me pleasure\nI don't know how to measure\nHow I feel about that shit\nBut that won't make me quit\nIn my quest, to scour the deep sea\nLike, you and me?\nSearching for an angle, mangled\nThe corpse in the Bermuda Triangle\nMaybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane\nWe're like \"oh, shit, what remains\"\nAnd\nThen we get to the bottom\nAmelia Earhart's like \"oh, shit, got em!\"\nYou didn't know, but I was an immortal\nI just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal\nShuffled off my fucking mortal coil\nMortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil\nAll my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal\nAnd you know, I am not gonna take a foil\nTo my head in a little tin cap shape\nBecause you know I'm great\nI popped the grape\nBut I'm not on some conspiracies\nI'm just trying to see what's up in the seas\nI believe that I will not cease and desist\nYou cannot resist\nWhen I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist\nI am in Manila, in Hong Kong\nIn San Francisco, doing a disco\nPop it hot like it's Crisco\nBut I gotta pace myself\nIf we're gonna raise this wealth\nThat's why I flow at this tempo\nHello, I do kempo\nIn my mind, that's a form of martial arts\nBut I take, partial starts\nAnd I just gave little partial farts\nWhen I'm shitting on the mic\n'Cause you know I got this heart\nAnd you know I got the K-Mart\nState-of-the-art mind\nBut I'm not be-hind\nNo, I'm way out in the front\nRolling up a 30-foot blunt\nAnd you know I'm not gonna bunt\nIn a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger\nBecause I am the rap ringer\nI never make the wrong call\nAnd you know, chicks dig the long ball!\nI am like (Ah)\nThey are like (Wow)\nWatsky, you cannot stop me\nI got no paparazzi\nI'm a fucking doorstep\nI'm gonna take one more

Witnesses\nThey got their hit list-esses\nWalking up to the different fuckin' doors\nSaying \"Would you like to love God a little more?\"\nBut it kinda sucks, just because of COVID\nThey can't be making no bids\nI heard they're not doing that door-knockin'\nBut, you know, we're not stoppin'\nHowever you appraise 'em\nNo, we are fuckin' raising\nOn the mic I'm fuckin' blazing\nIf the sun is blazing\nI turn into a raisin\nI'm bringing this whole craze\nFor almost two whole days\nI don't think that's possible\nI don't think that's wise\nI don't think that's probable\nThat is what they say when they look in to my eyes\nMy momma was afraid for me\nShe busted in like the ma\u00eetre d\nShe said \"Hello umm\"\nI don't think you wanna sit here\nI don't think you wanna get here\n'Cause you

gotta be patient\nIf you don't understand\nI got my fuckin' rhymes on demand\nI can run it back\nBut I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness\nIf I'm trying to fuckin' win this\nI will not get winded, I have not rescinded\nAnything that I've fucking said\nBy the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead\nI'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds\nThat is like Right Said Fred\nYou just gotta relax\nIf you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe\nI don't get lyrical cataracts\nSo I can see clearly, so I can be dearly\nReceived, I've got to achieve\nWhatever I've got up my

They gonna call off the bounty.\n\nGREGGS: Take the truce, Omar.\n\nOMAR: I might, if they ain't tryin' to play me. They said they want to parley on it.\n\nMcNULTY: Parley?\n\nOMAR: Look, I don't know, man, but right now I need some assistance from y'all. Yo, son, I go to the ER, Avon, you know he gonna have his henchmen waitin' in the parking lot for me. Look, I know y'all friendly with a couple of doctors, right? Right?\n\nWIG: He says he can buy weight. Says he runs with some decent-size locals.\n\nCHIEF: Like who?\n\nWIG: Barksdale. Avon Barksdale.\n\nCHIEF: Run it through the dex and H.I.D.T.A., See what comes back.\n\nWIG: Alright, I'm gonna check around, see if anybody's working these names you're giving us. And if you full of shit, pal, I'm gonna know it quick.\n\nORLANDO: But, what happens to me while you checkin'\n\nWIG: Eager street. City jail, motherfucker.\n\nMAMA ON THE PHONE: Luis came home last week. I ain't seen him since afram. Uh-huh. Yep. I can't believe it.\n\n[Belching]\n\nSYDNOR: Damn, Carv, you's triflin'.\n\nCARVER: Yeah, I admit it, I'm disgusting.\n\nSYDNOR: Cheesepuffs and fuckin' ring-dings?\n\nCARVER: Yeah.\n\n[Phone ringing]\n\nFREAMON: Yeah.\n\nSANTANGELO: The big fuck from the high-rise, what's his name?\n\nFREAMON: Little man.\n\nSANTANGELO: Yeah, him.\n\n[Phone ringing]\n\nCARVER: Yo.\n\nFREAMON: Be ready, we're on it.\n\nBUNK: Look at this pretty motherfucker.\n\nNORRIS: Too fucked up to drive home, McNulty?\n\nMcNULTY: Hey, Bunk. Kid gave us a murder. More than that, he's put in Stringer Bell.\n\nBUNK: Oh, yeah?\n\nMcNULTY: Picks out Wee-Bey, Bird and Stinkum from photo arrays. Puts them all up at the Greek's the night they grabb up Omar's boy Brandon. Puts Bell in the truck, too. Says Stringer told me to point out the stickup boy.\n\nBUNK: Geez, what do you have over him?\n\nMcNULTY: Not a fucking thing. Kid was ready. Barely had to push him.\n\nBUNK: Whose case?\n\nMcNULTY: Norris's.\n\nBUNK: How old?\n\nMcNULTY: 16. Lives in a shit-hole vacant over on Argyle. When I grab him up, I swear he's halfway into a nod.\n\nBUNK: Using?\n\nMcNULTY: Hmm. When they killed the stickup boy, the motherfuckers dumped the body in the alley right behind where this kid and all the other low-rise hoppers lay their heads. Can you imagine? All he can think about.\n\nBUNK: You telling me he's gonna have to testify?\n\nMcNULTY: Not yet, we'll get there. Problem is, what do I do with him now?\n\n[Camera clicking]\n\n[Phone ringing]\n\nFREAMON: Yep.\n\nSANTANGELO: Big boy picking up.\n\nFREAMON: Okay.\n\nMALE: You holler at me, right?\n\nLITTLE MAN: Where you at, man, we all the way down.\n\nMAIN STASH MAN: First thing tomorrow, man.\n\n[Phone ringing]\n\nCARVER: Yeah?\n\nFREAMON: It's him, stay on it.\n\nCARVER: Right.\n\nMALE: I didn't do nothing, man, get me outta here.\n\nMALE ON RADIO: The two-two grounded slowly towards third gets through at the last moment.\n\nMALE: Where my phone call at? Suzuki's at the line drive, up the middle, a base hit for Suzuki. Suzuki's very patient at the plate.\n\nPRISONER: Yeah, man, it's me. Guess who's up in here. Pimpin' ass Orlando, from the club. Yeah. Courtside.\n\nDANIELS: So, how long you been slingin'?\n\nWALLACE: Since I was, maybe, 12.\n\nDANIELS: And how long were you with Barksdale's crew in the low-rises?\n\nWALLACE: With D'Angelo? Not long. He came down from the towers at the beginning of the summer. Before that I worked for Ronnie Mo.\n\nMcNULTY: D'Angelo ever talk to you about what happened in the two-two-one building? With Pooh getting shot? How about anything else like that?\n\nWALLACE: Like what?\n\nMcNULTY: Killings, murders.\n\nWALLACE: Naw, Dee, he was good to me. He alright.\n\nDANIELS: But D'Angelo, he was who you called that night at the Greek's, right?\n\nWALLACE: Yeah, but he didn't go up there. It was mostly those tower boys.\n\nMcNULTY: And Stringer, you said Stringer was in the truck. He called you over, asked you to point out the stickup boy.\n\nPEARLMAN: All of it corroborated by the beeper logs and the phones.\n\nMcNULTY: Stinkum's dead. We've already got bird for the Gant killing. This ties them all in.\n\nDANIELS: D'Angelo, too.\n\nBUNK: Maybe, but since he didn't show at the Greeks, and tells the jury he didn't see the murder coming.\n\nMcNULTY: Well, it's enough to charge him, anyway.\n\nPEARLMAN: Parents?\n\nMcNULTY: Alcoholic mother. In the wind, no fixed address. Says he's got a grandmother down on the eastern shore, but he hasn't seen her in years.\n\nBUNK: How about a hotel room?\n\nDANIELS: On whose dime? No way the deputy approve the manpower to stash a 16-year-old, much less the room service.\n\nLANDSMAN: McNulty, line two.\n\nDANIELS: How 'bout you run this up to front office? See if the state's attorney will kick in.\n\nPEARLMAN: He's a kid, Cedric. Even if we clear the money, do you really want to put a juvenile in a hotel for six months, waiting on a trial date? I think you all need to get with grandma down on the shore.\n\nMcNULTY: Now? She's doing this right now? They don't have to set a hearing date or something like that? Christ, yeah, okay. Yeah. I fucking need a fucking lawyer.\n\nPEARLMAN: What?\n\nCARVER: Still, you can see that they got the security bars and look there. Cameras... It's all over the yard out the street.\n\nSYDNOR: And I checked with Verizon, there's no phone service at that address.\n\nFREAMON: Well, that's a telltale right there.\n\nSYDNOR: So what? We try to write a warrant for this place, right?\n\nCARVER: Right?\n\nFREAMON: What are you seeing?\n\nPREZ: No pattern, really. Except this cluster of old storefronts and warehouses on the Westside of downtown.\n\nFREAMON: Uh-huh.\n\nPREZ: Around Paca, Eutaw, Howard Street, mostly.\n\nFREAMON: Storefronts?\n\nPREZ: Vacants, usually. Three different holding companies.\n\nFREAMON: Detective Prezbylewski...\n\nPREZ: What?\n\nFREAMON: You have a gift for the paper trail. Tomorrow calls for some street work, though. Are you street ready?\n\nPREZ: Um, you know the lieutenant has me in-office. I don't have my gun until the grand jury.\n\nFREAMON: You won't need one.\n\nPREZ: On the street? No gun?\n\nFREAMON: No gun. Not for this.\n\nBUCKMAN: Furthermore, Mr. McNulty, having utilized his sons in an act of police work, involving a criminal suspect, actually lost track of them in the crowd of a municipal market. This is simply unacceptable, your honor.\n\nJUDGE: Be that as it may, an emergency ex parte order is an extraordinary you actually want me to limit visitations to afternoons only and you want Mrs.. McNulty present at all visitations? C'mon.\n\nBUCKMAN: It is not a single lapse, judge. Mr. McNulty has time and again failed to properly care for the children when they're in his custody. I have a list of recent events, your honor, that justify an order.\n\nJUDGE: Ms. Pearlman, do you have a response you'd like to offer up here?\n\nPEARLMAN: Nope.\n\nJUDGE: Nothing?\n\nPEARLMAN: If this were possession with intent, I'd be a prosecutor with a plan. But a domestic? Your honor, I'm officially clueless. In fact, as an employee of the state, I should not actually be here.\n\nJUDGE: Alright, listen up, people. Before you have me make a ruling on an emergency petition, everybody here needs to take a deep breath, huh? Literally, c'mon. Now, then, is Mr. McNulty capable of having a civil conversation with Mrs.. McNulty?\n\nMcNULTY: Yes, your honor.\n\nJUDGE: And is Mrs. McNulty equally capable of having a conversation with Mr. McNulty?\n\nELENA: Yes.\n\nJUDGE: Good, then I'm going to lunch. And let's see when I return if we can't busy this court with something just a little more engaging than the problems of the McNultys.\n\nORLANDO: Look, the charge is on me, I understand that, I'll carry that. But the least our people can do is throw down a little something to pay the bondsman.\n\nLEVY: That's the deed of transfer for the club. And the other thing is a license transfer application they're both backdated and notarized for last week.\n\nORLANDO: What?\n\nLEVY: A front has to be clean. And right now, you ain't that. Sign.\n\nORLANDO: I want my bail paid. You send me a bondsman, I'll sign.\n\nLEVY: Is that what you want me to tell him? That I asked you to sign and you wouldn't? Hmm? You wanted to be in the game, right? Now you're in the game.\n\nELENA: Unbelievable, you show up with her.\n\nMcNULTY: Elena, you went for an emergency ex parte. I grabbed whatever lawyer was standing around.\n\nELENA: Oh, she was standing? Hey, ask her if she wants the pictures back. Let's see: I've got her at the restaurant, with you pulling out her chair. I've got her at the motel parking lot with you opening the car door for her because you're such a fucking gentleman now.\n\nMcNULTY: Yeah, well, I can't believe you hired Buckman. The son of a bitch never made a case that counted.\n\nELENA: Yeah, well he caught your cheating ass.\n\nMcNULTY: Elena, why are we here?\n\nELENA: Because you can't... you can't have Sean and Michael around criminals. You can't lose them in a Baltimore market. That's why.\n\nMcNULTY: It wasn't a criminal. I know the guy. It was a game we were playing. It was daylight on a crowded street. They could've been following Al Capone. It would've been fine. Look, Elena, these are my sons. I love them. Do you hear, I love them. I'm not gonna let them get hurt. I love you, too. Still do.\n\nELENA: Does she know about the detective and the pictures?\n\nMcNULTY: No, why would I tell her about that?\n\nELENA: And are the two of you still...\n\nMcNULTY: No. Yes... Little. C'mon, let's make nice for the judge. Okay.\n\nMALE ON TV: We know we have a month more to go and we're not gonna let up. We are going to raise more, we are going to spend more, and on election day, we are going to be out there, pushing the vote in every precinct.\n\nDANIELS: You ready? C'mon, we'll get dinner first.\n\nWALLACE: Ain't so hungry.\n\nDANIELS: C'mon. How much were you using? I'm askin' if you're gonna be sick in my car.\n\nWALLACE: A cap now and then.\n\nDANIELS: You just snorting? You be alright in a day or two. C'mon.\n\nSTRINGER: Yo, this nigga comin' or what, man?\n\nJOE: Said he would, if I guaranteed a parley. And I'm here on it. 'Course, he said y'all would be paying my fee, rather than his own himself.\n\nSTRINGER: Your fee?\n\nJOE: I'm doin' like one of them marriage counselors. Charge by the hour to tell some fool he need to bring some flowers home. Then charge another hour tellin' the bitch she ought to suck some cock every little once and a while. You know, keep a marriage strong like that. Speakin' of cocksuckers. Don't believe we met. Proposition Joe. You ever steal from me, I kill your whole family. Alright. Y'all both hereon my guarantee, so respect that shit and say what you feel. I'm up outta here.\n\nSTRINGER: I gotta man who say he gonna give you your life back, yo.\n\nOMAR: Who, Barksdale?\n\nSTRINGER: My man say, tell that motherfucker that if he can find a way not to dip in our pockets, we're gonna call this shit even.\n\nOMAR: Y'all aced Bailey, and what you did to my boy? So, y'all think after what you did to Brandon, we supposed to find some even on this, huh?\n\nSTRINGER: Yo, I don't know shit about shit, a-ight? I'm just the messenger.\n\nOMAR: Whatever, man.\n\nSTRINGER: You know there's dead on both sides, right? And there's gonna be a whole lot more if this beef keep up. But the truth be told... There be more soldiers in one half than the other. You know what I'm sayin'?\n\nOMAR: Hey, look here, son, you tell Barksdale, that he's been paid back for what he did to my peoples. But as for his product, well, a man's got to earn a living, you know?\n\nSTRINGER: I don't know nobody called Barksdale, \"B\". The man I'm talking about, can't have his shit taken like that. That won't do.\n\nOMAR: A-ight, tell him throw me some cash then, and we'll see... 'Bout five or 10,000. You know what I mean, for my retirement, homes.\n\nSTRINGER: Five if you can keep quiet about it.\n\nOMAR: Send my money through Joe, man.\n\nSTRINGER: You go through Joe, you're not gonna see 2,000 of that. Why don't you tell my man where you at--\n\nOMAR: Naw, naw, naw, naw. We gonna figure something else out, you heard? I be in touch, homes.\n\nMcNULTY: How careful is Stringer Bell?\n\nGREGGS: \"I don't know no one named Barksdale.\" Shit.\n\nMcNULTY: Still we got him tied to the Brandon killing. That can be enough for one day's work.\n\nOMAR: Did what I could for y'all.\n\nDANIELS: Is she alright?\n\nWALLACE: Yeah, I spent the summer here when I was nine.\n\nDANIELS: When was the last time they saw you?\n\nWALLACE: When I was nine. What's that?\n\nDANIELS: What?\n\nWALLACE: That noise.\n\nDANIELS: It's crickets.\n\nWALLACE: Cricket. Crickets.\n\nAVON: He try to go in my pockets again?\n\nSTRINGER: This nigga talkin' 'bout five g's, \"B\".\n\nAVON: Oh, shit.\n\n[Knocking]\n\nBEY: What's up, baby?\n\nSHARDENE: Antwon said to bring these up. Y'all want anything else?\n\nBEY: Naw, we cool.\n\nAVON: I'm sayin' though, how we supposed to pay that?\n\nSTRINGER: He talkin' 'bout goin' through Joe, but I'm like, fuck...\n\nAVON: Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo. Thank you, Ma, you know what I mean? You look good and your services are appreciated. Keep them tips, I hope you makin' them, baby. Make the motherfucker come down to the towers to get the rest of his money, you know what I'm sayin'? If he stupid enough to come down to them towers.\n\nSTRINGER: It's a wrap, pow, y'all get go.\n\nAVON: How you supposed to pay that?\n\nGIRLS: A-ight.\n\nCHERYL: Y'all thank you. No, no, no, you see, I went to journalism school. Northwestern. So, y'all can't stay with me on this.\n\nGREGGS: irl, you talkin' like you some crusty old reporter.\n\nCHERYL: Well, excuse me?\n\nGREGGS: Bitch, you work at a TV station.\n\nCHERYL: It's the same thing, alright? Look, c'mon, stop talkin'.\n\nGREGGS: Here we go.\n\nCHERYL: Bring it.\n\nGIRL#1: C'mon, Kima.\n\nGREGGS: C'mon. I gotta work tomorrow.\n\nTOGETHER: Aw!\n\nCHERYL: Candy ass. That's all I have to say. Okay, you see?\n\nGIRL#1: I'm with you.\n\nCHERYL: Alright. Look at Tonya. And she run a damn art gallery. You see, police in this town ain't about shit.\n\nGREGGS: Guess not.\n\nCHERYL: Mm-hmm, thank you.\n\nGREGGS: Can't hold our liquor. Can't hold a donut. [Laughing] And if you ask me, I guess we... ain't good in bed, neither.\n\nCHERYL: Oh, don't go there, officer. Don't go there.\n\nGIRL#2: Kima, how did you know you wanted to be a cop? I mean, how did you choose that? When you were little, did you think about it at all, or...\n\nGIRL#3: C'mon, Kima.\n\nGREGGS: I remember when I was in the Northeast, still field-training as a cadet. I didn't know if I was gonna stick with it or not. And then we got this one call, we chased this purse-snatch up into these apartments. I T.O. And shit, I ain't even no police yet. You know, I'm just a trainee. And I'm alone. Anyway, I mean, I don't know how, but I find the guy. So, I catch him and I hold on to him and I manage to get to my radio. And we in the middle of this parking lot, and we're rolling around and shit and this motherfucker's steady kicking my ass trying to get away. And I look over and I see these black patents, and these uniform blue pants. I look up and it's Charlie Smoot, Charlie fucking Smoot, you know, this guy's a legend. He looks down at me and he smiles, you know real quiet-like. And he drops his cuffs. He says, \"Here ya go, rook.\" That's all he says. Here you go, rook.\" And then he dropped the bracelets and walked away. I mean, I know you don't like it. But shit, I was proud.\n\nFEMALE: Ooh.\n\nGIRL#3: Goddamn.\n\nSYDNOR: Lester says we ain't gonna write a warrant on this place. How do we not with all this P.C.?\n\nGREGGS: We're on the main stash, right? Why would we kick the door in when all we have to do is park a van down the street and follow the entire Westside drug supply in and out of the place?\n\nMcNULTY: We're gonna start picking up pieces of Barksdale's world we never even knew about.\n\nWIG: Been hell looking for you people. What the hell's the name of this unit anyway?\n\nGREGGS: What up, Wig?\n\nWIG: Aw, shit, Kima in the house. What up?\n\nGREGGS: State Police, C.I.D., out of Pikesville. Name of Troy Wiggins, but pay no attention to the man, 'cause he about 90-95% pure bullshit.\n\nWIG: Kima, she just talk like that 'cause I had her when she was good.\n\nGREGGS: Shit, you motherfucker turned me the other way.\n\nWIG: Shit, a-ight. Here's the thing, boys and girls. I'm doin' a reverse buy down in Arundel, right? And I get this Westside asshole nibbling on four ounces?\n\nMcNULTY: A whole four ounces?\n\nWIG: I know, he ain't much, but... I get him in the boat and he starts floppin' around, sayin' he can buy weight from some motherfucker name of Barksdale. I never heard of no Barksdale. And the computer has Avon Barksdale as an active Baltimore city target. So, I go down to city narcotics and Dawson, he sends me down here to see y'all.\n\nMcNULTY: So, what's the name of your fish?\n\nWIG: Wendell O. as in, oh-shit-I-tried-to-buy from a state police Blocker.\n\nMcNULTY: That wouldn't be Orlando Blocker would it?\n\nWIG: Yeah. U on it?\n\nMcNULTY: Orlando.\n\nSHARDENE: They keep that back room locked. And even if I do get back there, on an errand, then they kinda shut down. They just... they get real quiet.\n\nFREAMON: You said you heard one say something about making someone come into the towers.\n\nSHARDENE: Yeah.\n\nFREAMON: Which one was talking?\n\nSHARDENE: He was tall, I think.\n\nFREAMON: Alright, but who else was there?\n\nSHARDENE: I don't really see that well without my glasses.\n\nFREAMON: Where are your glasses? You can't see faces without those? You don't wear those while you're working, do you, darlin'?\n\nSHARDENE: Would you? I gotta live off drinks and tips.\n\nMcNULTY: No way!\n\nPEARLMAN: Why not?\n\nMcNULTY: Because a player wouldn't be the name on the liquor license. And a player would have a connect for Barksdale's coke. He wouldn't walk into state troopers.\n\nPEARLMAN: He caught a charge and now he's talking out his ass.\n\nMcNULTY: I mean, face it. You're never gonna get Avon or Stringer in the same room as the dope. We make this case on their voices alone.\n\nPEARLMAN: So maybe he can't buy from Barksdale. Maybe he can only buy from Savino or Wee-Bey.\n\nGREGGS: Well, fuck him, then. We already got Wee-Bey tied to a murder, and Savino's the runt of the litter.\n\nPEARLMAN: We can take whatever Orlando gives us about the club. The money laundering... maybe or the girls. For that kind of cooperation a few years is fair...\n\nSUIT: Daniels in here?\n\nDANIELS: Yeah.\n\nSUIT: Call from Deputy Commissioner for you. You want it in here?\n\nDANIELS: No.\n\nMcNULTY: He doesn't miss much.\n\n[Pager beeping]\n\nBUBBLES: I need some help here.\n\nGREGGS: C'mon, bubs. You got me comin' across town in the middle of a fucked-up workday just so you can hold 10, that shit ain't right.\n\nBUBBLES: Hold on, I don't need 10. Okay, I don't know. I need a place of my own. Alright, some bed, some sheets, some clothes. I definitely need some new clothes.\n\nGREGGS: How long you been clean?\n\nBUBBLES: Three days.\n\nGREGGS: You serious about it?\n\nBUBBLES: Who knows?\n\nGREGGS: What the fuck am I gonna do with a clean informant? Did you think about that? A-ight, I'm on it with you.\n\nBUBBLES: Yeah?\n\nGREGGS: Yeah. Yo, what the fuck, gimme some love.\n\nBUBBLES: Okay, I mean, I think I can get, a mattress, my own place, everything for like couple hundred dollars.\n\nGREGGS: A-ight. We'll talk. I gotta be somewhere tonight, so, hit me on my page tomorrow.\n\nBUBBLES: Tomorrow?\n\nGREGGS: I got you.\n\nCHIEF: The cooperator says he can buy weight.\n\nDANIELS: Not from Barksdale or Bell.\n\nCHIEF: How can you be sure?\n\nDANIELS: How much dope or coke do you think Avon Barksdale into the room? A kilo? Two kilos, 20 kilos? We are not going to buy our way up the ladder here. These people do not touch the drugs. They don't go near the drugs. The wire is what gives us Barksdale. It gives us the whole crew. Day by day, piece by piece.\n\nBURRELL: Buy-bust, lieutenant. It's what I asked you for months ago. It's what we do successfully time and again to make these cases.\n\nMcNULTY: Why New York?\n\nOMAR: Must be somethin' happenin' out there, man. Too big a town, you know what I mean?\n\nMcNULTY: You don't believe in the truce?\n\nOMAR: If he had said, \"We ain't paying, just be happy to live,\" I'd have been like, a-ight they keepin' it real. But he say, c'mon down I'm, like, man, please. Hey, look here, homes, I ain't asked for much, but, um, I'm a little light on traveling money. I'm sayin' I could go around the block and get myself paid, but I'm thinkin'.\n\nMcNULTY: You keep in touch with my pager. We're gonna need you for the Gant trial. Go easy, Omar. Stay free!\n\nMALE #1 ON TAPE: They be picking me up outside the cut-rate on Lex and Fulton. I be up there after 10, right?\n\nMALE #2: That'll work.\n\nDANIELS: Listen up, people. We've got 30,000 in buy money courtesy of our friends over at D.E.A., But the thing is, they can't have that money walkin' on them.\n\nD.E.A. COP: Definitely not.\n\nDANIELS: So, Kima will be in the car for the buy, fronting as our C.I.'s girl.\n\nCARVER: Lookin' the part, too.\n\nDANIELS: Now, where's your weapon gonna be?\n\nGREGGS: He might pat me, so, it has to stash in the car. I figure when Savino gets in the car at the cut-rate, I'll be going in back, it'll be up under the rear seat.\n\nDANIELS: And we probably can't be close enough for an eyeball on this, but the car will be a live wire, and Kima will be throwin' us 20s whenever she can. Rhonda?\n\nPEARLMAN: I only want to remind Mr. Blocker here that his plea agreement is contingent on cooperation. And a buy-bust on Savino Bratton is less cooperative than a buy-bust from someone higher up on the food chain. If you can get Savino talking about Avon or Stringer that's better for us and better for you.\n\nCARVER: They already know that he got jacked on a reverse buy, right? Why wouldn't they assume he's snitchin'?\n\nORLANDO: I need money for a lawyer, right?\n\nDANIELS: That's the story. He got popped,  now he needs to get right back into it to pay the bondsman and the lawyer. Alright. Let's make this work.\n\nD.E.A. COP: Careful... That's my career you're holding there.\n\nSYDNOR: You got a unit?\n\nCARVER: Parked in the mezzanine.\n\nSYDNOR: Gimme the keys, man.\n\nCARVER: Naw, I'm driving, motherfucker.\n\nDEALER: C'mon, man.\n\nBUBBLES: Ain't up.\n\nDEALER: Death row.\n\n[Car radio]\n\nORLANDO: My girl... Half the money hers.\n\nGREGGS: Baby, since we're going down North Avenue, stop by the carry-out, so I can pick me up some cigarettes.\n\nDANIELS: They're goin' up north, stay loose.\n\nFREAMON: Shit. It's too loud.\n\nMcNULTY: Does any unit have the eyeball?\n\nCARVER: Negative, 11-35.\n\nMcNULTY: C'mon, Greggs, tell us where the fuck you are.\n\nSAVINO:Pull in there, pull in there. Don't fuck with this scam. I'll be right back with your shit.\n\n[Car radio playing loudly]\n\n[Car radio shutting off]\n\nGREGGS: Where are we? The sign said Longwood, but I could swear this was Warwick.\n\nORLANDO: Hoppers be turning the sign poles to fuck with y'all.\n\nGREGGS: I make it we're on the north side of Warwick, in an alley... I don't know, shit, half of block west of Longwood, maybe? I hope y'all copy that.\n\nDANIELS: Yeah, that puts us about eight blocks away. I'm pushing in a little closer.\n\nMcNULTY: All units be advised. Warwick near Longwood in the North side alley. Or near that 20.\n\nGREGGS: This got the right feel for you?\n\n[Car ignition starting]\n\nSYDNOR: You creepin' closer?\n\nORLANDO: He better not be long, 'cause, see, I don't know where the stash is, and if they draggin' us all over this part of town, you know.\n\nGREGGS: What's that?\n\nORLANDO: What?\n\nGREGGS: Something ain't right.\n\nORLANDO: What?\n\nGREGGS: Shit ain't right.

UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING\n\nEight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a\nbreakfast cafe.  They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,\nMR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,\nand the big boss, JOE CABOT.  Most are finished eating and\nare enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a\nsmall address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and\ninvolved story about Madonna.\n\nMR. PINK\n\"Like a Virgin\" is all about a\ngirl who digs a guy with a big\ndick.  The whole song is a\nmetaphor for big dicks.\n\nMR. BLUE\nNo it's not.  It's about a girl\nwho is very vulnerable and she's\nbeen fucked over a few times.\nThen she meets some guy who's\nreally sensitive--\nMR. PINK\n--Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.\nTell that bullshit to the\ntourists.\n\nJOE\n(looking through his\naddress book)\nToby...who the fuck is Toby?\nToby...Toby...think...think...\nthink...\n\nMR. PINK\nIt's not about a nice girl who\nmeets a sensitive boy.  Now\ngranted that's what \"True Blue\" is\nabout, no argument about that.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nWhich one is \"True Blue?\"\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nYou don't remember \"True Blue?\"\nThat was a big ass hit for\nMadonna.  Shit, I don't even\nfollow this Tops In Pops shit, and\nI've at least heard of \"True\nBlue.\"\n\nMR. ORANGE\nLook, asshole, I didn't say I\nain't heard of it.  All I asked\nwas how does it go?  Excuse me\nfor not being the world's biggest\nMadonna fan.\n\nMR. BROWN\nI hate Madonna.\n\nMR. BLUE\nI like her early stuff.  You know,\n\"Lucky Star,\" \"Borderline\" - but\nonce she got into her \"Papa Don't\nPreach\" phase, I don't know, I\ntuned out.\n\nMR. PINK\nHey, fuck all that, I'm\nmaking a point here.  You're gonna\nmake me lose my train\nof thought.\n\nJOE\nOh fuck, Toby's that little china\ngirl.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat's that?\n\nJOE\nI found this old address book in a\njacket I ain't worn in a coon's\nage.  Toby what?  What the fuck\nwas her last name?\n\nMR. PINK\nWhere was I?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nYou said \"True Blue\" was about a\nnice girl who finds a sensitive\nfella.  But \"Like a Virgin\" was a\nmetaphor for big dicks.\n\nMR. PINK\nLet me tell ya what \"Like a\nVirgin\"'s about.  It's about some\ncooze who's a regular fuck\nmachine.\nI mean all the time, morning, day,\nnight, afternoon, dick, dick,\ndick, dick, dick,\ndick, dick, dick, dick, dick,\ndick.\n\nMR. BLUE\nHow many dicks was that?\n\nMR. WHITE\nA lot.\n\nMR. PINK\nThen one day she meets a John\nHolmes motherfucker, and it's\nlike, whoa baby.  This mother\nfucker's like Charles Bronson in\n\"The Great Escape.\"  He's diggin\ntunnels.  Now she's gettin this\nserious dick action, she's feelin\nsomething she ain't felt since\nforever.  Pain.\n\nJOE\nChew?  Toby Chew?  No.\n\nMR. PINK\nIt hurts.  It hurts her.  It\nshouldn't hurt.  Her pussy should\nbe Bubble-Yum by now.  But when\nthis cat fucks her, it hurts.  It\nhurts like the first time.  The\npain is reminding a fuck machine\nwhat is was like to be a virgin.\nHence, \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nThe fellas crack up.\n\nJOE\nWong?\n\nMR. PINK\nFuck you, wrong.  I'm right!  What\nthe fuck do you know about it\nanyway?  You're still listening to\nJerry-fucking-Vale.\n\nJOE\nNot wrong, dumb ass, Wong!  You\nknow, like the Chinese name?\n\nMr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand.  They\nfight, but they're not really mad at each other.\n\nMR. WHITE\nGive me this fucking thing.\n\nJOE\nWhat the fuck do you think you're\ndoin?  Give me my book back!\n\nMR. WHITE\nI'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe,\nI'll give it back when we leave.\n\nJOE\nWhaddaya mean, give it to me when\nwe leave, give it back now.\n\nMR. WHITE\nFor the past fifteen minutes now,\nyou've just been droning on with\nnames.  \"Toby...Toby...Toby...\nToby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby\nChung...fuckin Charlie Chan.\"  I\ngot Madonna's big dick outta my\nright ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-\nknow-what, outta my left.\n\nJOE\nWhat do you care?\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhen you're annoying as hell, I\ncare a lot.\n\nJOE\nGive me my book.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou gonna put it away?\n\nJOE\nI'm gonna do whatever I wanna do\nwith it.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWell, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna\nhave to keep it.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nJoe, you want me to shoot him for\nyou?\n\nMR. WHITE\nShit, you shoot me in a dream, you\nbetter wake up and apologize.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nHave you guys been listening to K-\nBILLY's super sounds of the\nseventies weekend?\n\nMR. PINK\nYeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nCan you believe the songs they\nbeen playin?\n\nMR. PINK\nNo, I can't.  You know what I\nheard the other day?  \"Heartbeat -\nIt's Lovebeat,\" by little Tony\nDeFranco and the DeFranco Family.\nI haven't heard that since I was\nin fifth fuckin grade.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nWhen I was coming down here, I was\nplayin it.  And \"The Night the\nLights Went Out in Georgia\" came\non.  Now I ain't heard that song\nsince it was big, but when it was\nbig, I heard it a million-\ntrillion times.  I'm listening to\nit this morning, and this was the\nfirst time I ever realized that\nthe lady singing the song, was the\none who killed Andy.\n\nMR. BLUE\nYou didn't know Vicki Lawrence\nkilled the guy?\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nI thought the cheatin wife shot\nAndy.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nThey say it in the song.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nI know, I heard it.  I musta zoned\nout whenever that part came on\nbefore.  I thought when she said\nthat little sister stuff, she was\ntalkin about her sister- in-law,\nthe cheatin wife.\n\nJOE\nNo, she did it.  She killed the\ncheatin wife, too.\n\nMR. PINK\nYou know the part in \"Gypsies,\nTramps and Theives,\" when she says\n\"Poppa woulda shot his if he knew\nwhat he'd done?\"  I could never\nfigure out what he did.\n\nThe table laughs.  The WAITRESS comes over to the table.\nShe has the check, and a pot of coffee.\n\nWAITRESS\nCan I get anybody more\ncoffee.\n\nJOE\nNo, we're gonna be hittin it.\nI'll take care of the check.\n\nShe hands the bill to him.\n\nWAITRESS\nHere ya go.  Please pay at the\nregister, if you wouldn't mind.\n\nJOE\nSure thing.\n\nWAITRESS\nYou guys have a wonderful day.\n\nThey all mutter equivalents.  She exits and Joe stands up.\n\nJOE\nI'll take care of this, you guys\nleave the tip.\n(to Mr. White)\nAnd when I come back, I want my\nbook back.\n\nMR. WHITE\nSorry, it's my book now.\n\nJOE\nBlonde, shoot this piece of shit,\nwill ya?\n\nMr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger.  Mr White\nacts shot.  Joe exits.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nOkay, everybody cough up green for\nthe little lady.\n\nEverybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.\nEverybody, that is, except Mr. White.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nC'mon, throw in a buck.\n\nMR. WHITE\nUh-uh.  I don't tip.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nWhaddaya mean you don't tip?\n\nMR. WHITE\nI don't believe in it.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nYou don't believe in tipping?\n\nMR. PINK\n(laughing)\nI love this kid, he's a madman,\nthis guy.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nDo you have any idea what these\nladies make?  They make shit.\n\nMR. WHITE\nDon't give me that.  She don't\nmake enough money, she can quit.\n\nEverybody laughs.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nI don't even know a Jew who'd have\nthe balls to say that.  So let's\nget this straight. You never ever\ntip?\n\nMR. WHITE\nI don't tip because society says I\ngotta.  I tip when somebody\ndeserves a tip.  When somebody\nreally puts forth an effort, they\ndeserve a little something extra.\nBut this tipping automatically,\nthat shit's for the birds.  As far\nas I'm concerned, they're just\ndoin their job.\n\nMR. BLUE\nOur girl was nice.\n\nMR. WHITE\nOur girl was okay.  She didn't do\nanything special.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nWhat's something special, take ya\nin the kitchen and suck your dick?\n\nThey all laugh.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nI'd go over twelve percent for\nthat.\n\nMR. WRITE\nLook, I ordered coffee.  Now we've\nbeen here a long fuckin time, and\nshe's only filled my cup three\ntimes.  When I order coffee,  I\nwant it filled six times.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nWhat if she's too busy?\n\nMR. WHITE\nThe words \"too busy\" shouldn't be\nin a waitress's vocabulary.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nExcuse me, Mr. White, but the last\nthing you need is another cup of\ncoffee.\n\nThey all laugh.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThese ladies aren't starvin to\ndeath.  They make minimum wage.\nWhen I worked for minimum wage, I\nwasn't lucky enough to have a job\nthat society deemed tipworthy.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nAhh, now we're getting down to it.\nIt's not just that he's a cheap\nbastard--\n\nMR. ORANGE\n--It is that too--\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\n--It is that too.  But it's also\nhe couldn't get a waiter job.  You\ntalk like a pissed off dishwasher:\n\"Fuck those cunts and their\nfucking tips.\"\n\nMR. BLONDE\nSo you don't care that they're\ncounting on your tip to live?\n\nMr. White rubs two of his fingers together.\n\nMR. WHITE\nDo you know what this is?  It's\nthe world's smallest violin,\nplaying just for the waitresses.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nYou don't have any idea what\nyou're talking about.  These\npeople bust their ass. This\nis a hard job.\n\nMR. WHITE\nSo's working at McDonald's, but\nyou don't feel the need to tip\nthem.  They're servin ya food, you\nshould tip em.  But no, society\nsays tip these guys over here, but\nnot those guys over there.  That's\nbullshit.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nThey work harder than the kids at\nMcDonald's.\n\nMR. WHITE\nOh yeah, I don't see them cleaning\nfryers.\n\nMR. BROWN\nThese people are taxed on the tips\nthey make.  When you stiff 'em,\nyou cost them money.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nWaitressing is the number one\noccupation for female non-college\ngraduates in this country.  It's\nthe one jab basically any woman\ncan get, and make a living on.\nThe reason is because of tips.\n\nMR. WHITE\nFuck all that.\n\nThey all laugh.\n\nMR. WHITE\nHey, I'm very sorry that the\ngovernment taxes their tips.\nThat's fucked up.  But that ain't\nmy fault.  it would appear that\nwaitresses are just one of the\nmany groups the government fucks\nin the ass on a regular basis.\nYou show me a paper says the\ngovernment shouldn't do that, I'll\nsign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll\nvote for it.  But what I won't do\nis play ball.  And this non-\ncollege bullshit you're telling\nme, I got two words for that:\n\"Learn to fuckin type.\"  Cause if\nyou're expecting me to help out\nwith the rent, you're in for a big\nfuckin surprise.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nHe's convinced me.  Give me my\ndollar back.\n\nEverybody laughs.  Joe's comes back to the table.\n\nJOE\nOkay ramblers, let's get to\nrambling.  Wait a minute, who\ndidn't throw in?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nMr. White.\n\nJOE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nMr. White?\n(to Mr. White)\nWhy?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nHe don't tip.\n\nJOE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nHe don't tip?\n(to Mr. White)\nYou don't tip?  Why?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nHe don't believe in it.\n\nJOE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nHe don't believe in it?\n(to Mr. White)\nYou don't believe in it?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nNope.\n\nJOE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nShut up!\n(to Mr. White)\nCough up the buck, ya cheap\nbastard, I paid for your goddamn\nbreakfast.\n\nMR. WHITE\nBecause you paid for the\nbreakfast, I'm gonna tip.\nNormally I wouldn't.\n\nJOE\nWhatever.  Just throw in your\ndollar, and let's move.\n(to Mr. Blonde)\nSee what I'm dealing with here.\nInfants.  I'm fuckin dealin with\ninfants.\n\nThe eight men get up to leave.  Mr. White's waist is in\nthe F.G.  As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's\ncarrying a gun.  They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House,\ntalking amongst themselves.\n\n\n2      EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY\n\nCREDIT SEQUENCE:\n\nWhen the credit sequence is finished, we    FADE TO BLACK:\n\nOver the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in\nagony.\n\nUnder the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING\nASS, through traffic.\n\nOver the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY\nELSE SAY:\n\nSOMEBODY ELSE (OS)\nJust hold on buddy boy.\n\nSomebody stops screaming long enough to say:\n\nSOMEBODY (OS)\nI'm sorry.  I can't believe\nshe killed me.  Who would've\nfuckin thought that?\n\nCUT TO:\n\n3      INT. GETAWAY GAR (MOVING) - DAY\n\nThe Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange.  He lies in the\nbackseat.  He's been SHOT in the stomach.  BLOOD covers\nboth him and the backseat.\n\nMr. White is the Somebody Else.  He's behind the wheel of\nthe getaway car.  He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and\nout of traffic.  Though he's driving for his life, he\nkeeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.\n\nThey are the only two in the car.\n\nMR. WHITE\nHey, just cancel that shit right\nnow!  You're hurt.  You're hurt\nreally fucking bad, but you ain't\ndying.\n\nMR. ORANGE\n(crying)\nAll this blood is scaring the shit\noutta me.  I'm gonna die, I know\nit.\n\nMR. WHITE\nOh excuse me, I didn't realize you\nhad a degree in medicine.  Are you\na doctor?  Are you a doctor?\nAnswer me please, are you a\ndoctor?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nNo, I'm not!\n\nMR. WRITE\nAhhhh, so you admit you don't know\nwhat you're talking about.  So if\nyou're through giving me your\namateur opinion, lie back and\nlisten to the news.  I'm taking\nyou back to the rendezvous, Joe's\ngonna get you a doctor, the\ndoctor's gonna fix you up, and\nyou're gonna be okay.  Now say it:\nyou're gonna be okay.  Say it:\nyou're gonna be okay!\n\nMr. Orange doesn't respond.  Mr. White starts pounding on\nthe steering wheel.\n\nMR. WHITE\nSay-the-goddamn-words: you're\ngonna be okay!\n\nMR. ORANGE\nI'm okay.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(softly)\nCorrect.\n\n4      INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\nThe CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse.  Then the\ndoor swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of\nMr. Orange inside.\n\nMr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.\n\nMr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.\n\nMR. WHITE\nJust hold on buddy boy.  Hold on,\nand wait for Joe.  I can't do\nanything for you, but when Joe\ngets here, which should be anytime\nnow, he'll be able to help you.\nWe're just gonna sit here, and\nwait for Joe.  Who are\nwe waiting for?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nJoe.\n\nMR. WHITE\nBet your sweet ass we are.\n\nMr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl\naround the warehouse.\n\nMR. ORANGE\n(yelling)\nDon't leave me!\n\nMr White bends back over him and takes his hand.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI ain't going anywhere.  I'm right\nhere.  I'm not gonna leave ya.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nLarry, I'm so scared, would you\nplease hold me.\n\nMr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange.\nCradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(whispering)\nGo ahead and be scared, you've\nbeen brave enough for one day.  I\nwant you to just relax now.\nYou're not gonna die, you're gonna\nbe fine.  When Joe gets here,\nhe'll make ya a hundred percent\nagain.\n\nMr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress.  He's\nstill holding his hand.  Mr. Orange looks up at his\nfriend.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nLook, I don't wanna be a fly in\nthe ointment, but if help doesn't\ncome soon, I gotta see a doctor.\nI don't give a fuck about jail, I\njust don't wanna die.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou're not gonna fucking die, all\nright?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nI wasn't born yesterday.  I'm\nhurt, and I'm hurt bad.\n\nMR. WHITE\nIt's not good...\n\nMR. ORANGE\nHey, bless your heart for what\nyou're trying to do.  I was\npanicking for a moment, but I've\ngot my senses back now.  The\nsituation is, I'm shot in the\nbelly.  And without medical\nattention, I'm gonna die.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI can' take you to a hospital.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nFuck jail!  I don't give a shit\nabout jail.  But I can't die.  You\ndon't have to take me in.  Just\ndrive me up to the front, drop me\non the sidewalk.  I'll take care\nof myself.  I won't tell them\nanything.  I swear to fucking god,\nI won't tell 'em anything.  Look\nin my eyes, look right in my eyes.\n(Mr. White does)\nI-won't-tell-them-anything.\nYou'll be safe.\n\nMR. WHITE\nLie back down, and try to--\n\nMR. ORANGE\nI'm going to die!   I need a\ndoctor!  I'm begging you,\ntake me to a doctor.\n\nMr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress.  Spent from\nhis outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:\n\nMR. ORANGE\nTake me to a doctor, take me to a\ndoctor, please.\n\nSuddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr.\nPink steps inside.\n\nMR. PINK\nWas that a fucking set-up or what?\n\nMr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.\n\nMR. PINK\nOh fuck, Orange got tagged.\n\nThroughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.\n\nMR. WHITE\nGun shot.\n\nMR. PINK\nOh that's just fucking great!\nWhere's Brown?\n\nMR. WHITE\nDead.\n\nMR. PINK\nGoddamn, goddamn!  How did he die?\n\nMR. WHITE\nHow the fuck do you think?  The\ncops shot him.\n\nMR. PINK\nOh this is bad, this is so bad.\n(referring to Mr.\nOrange)\nIs it bad?\n\nMR. WHITE\nAs opposed to good?\n\nMR. PINK\nThis is so fucked up.  Somebody\nfucked us big time.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou really think we were set up?\n\nMR. PINK\nYou even doubt it?  I don't think\nwe got set up, I know we got set\nup!  I mean really, seriously,\nwhere did all those cops come\nfrom, huh?  One minute they're not\nthere, the next minute\nthey're there.  I didn't hear any\nsirens.  The alarm went off, okay.\nOkay, when an alarm goes off, you\ngot an average of four minutes\nresponse time.  Unless a patrol\ncar is cruising that street, at\nthat particular moment, you got\nfour minutes before they can\nrealistically respond.  In one\nminute there were seventeen blue\nboys out there.  All loaded for\nbear, all knowing exactly what the\nfuck they were doing, and they\nwere all just there!  Remember\nthat second wave that showed up in\nthe cars? Those were the ones\nresponding to the alarm.  but\nthose other motherfuckers were\nalready there, they were waiting\nfor us.\n(pause)\nYou haven't thought about this?\n\nMR. WHITE\nI haven't had a chance to think.\nFirst I was just trying to get the\nfuck outta there.  And after we\ngot away, I've just been dealin\nwith him.\n\nMR. PINK\nWell, you better start thinking\nabout it.  Cause I, sure as fuck,\nam thinking about it.  In fact,\nthat's all I'm thinking about.  I\ncame this close to just driving\noff.  Whoever set us up, knows\nabout this place.  There could've\nbeen cops sitting here waiting for\nme.  For all we know, there's\ncops, driving fast, on their way\nhere now.\n\nMR. WHITE\nLet's go in the other room...\n\nThe camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner.  We\nmove past it, and see down a hall.\n\n5      INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY\n\nAt the end of the hall is a bathroom.  The bathroom door\nis partially closed, restricting our view.  Mr. Pink is\nobscured, but Mr. White is in view.\n\nMR. PINK (OS)\nWhat the fuck am I doing here?  I\nfelt funny about this job right\noff.  As soon as I felt it I\nshould said \"No thank you\", and\nwalked.  But I never fucking\nlisten.  Every time I ever got\nburned buying weed, I always knew\nthe guy wasn't right.  I just felt\nit.  But I wanted to believe him.\nIf he's not lyin to me, and it\nreally is Thai stick, then whoa\nbaby.  But it's never Thai stick.\nand I always said if I felt that\nway about a job, I'd walk.  And I\ndid, and I didn't, because of\nfuckin money!\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat's done is done, I need you\ncool.  Are you cool?\n\nMR. PINK\nI'm cool.\n\nMR. WHITE\nSplash some water on your face.\nTake a breather.\n\nWe hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on\nhis face.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI'm gonna get me my smokes.\n\nMr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and\nOUT OF FRAME.  We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards\nus, bent over the sink.  Then he grabs a towels, and dries\nhis face.  Mr White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of\nChesterfields in his hand.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWant a smoke?\n\nMR. PINK\nWhy not?\n\nThe two men light up.\n\nMR. WHITE\nOkay, let's go through what\nhappened.  We're in the place,\neverything's going fine.  Then the\nalarm gets tripped.  I turn around\nand all these cops are outside.\nYou're right, it was like, bam!  I\nblink my eyes are they're there.\nEverybody starts going apeshit.\nThen Mr. Blonde starts shootin all\nthe--\n\nMR. PINK\n--That's not correct.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat's wrong with it?\n\nMR. PINK\nThe cops didn't show up after the\nalarm went off.  They didn't show\ntill after Mr. Blonde started\nshooting everyone.\n\nMR. WHITE\nAs soon as I heard the alarm, I\nsaw the cops.\n\nMR. PINK\nI'm telling ya, it wasn't that\nsoon.  They didn't let their\npresence be known until after Mr.\nBlonde went off.  I'm not sayin\nthey weren't there, I'm sayin they\nwere there.  But they didn't move\nin till Mr. Blonde became a\nmadman.  That's how I know we were\nset up.  You can see that,\ncan't you, Mr. White?\n\nMR. WHITE\nLook, enough of this \"Mr White\"\nshit--\n\nMR. PINK\n--Don't tell me your name, I don't\nwant to know!  I sure as hell\nain't gonna tell ya\nmine.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou're right, this is bad.\n(pause)\nHow did you get out?\n\nMR. PINK\nShot my way out.  Everybody was\nshooting, so I just blasted my way\noutta there.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n6      EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY\n\nMr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk.  He has\na canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357\nMAGNUM in the other.  If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he\njust knocks them down.  We DOLLY at the same speed, right\nalong side of him.\n\nFOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink.  We DOLLY with\nthem.\n\nWe DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates.  ROLLERGIRL\nis plugged into a walkman.  We hear the song she's\nlistening to LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK.  She's twirling and\nskating backwards to the beat of the song.\n\nRollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink.  The\nman and woman CRASH to the ground.\n\nMr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car\nthat SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over\nhim.\n\n\n7      INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY\n\nThe CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the\ncar's driver.  Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood,\nshakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver.\n\nMR. PINK\nGet outta the car!  Get the fuck\noutta the car!\n\nThe Shocked Woman starts screaming.\n\nMr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's\nlocked.\n\nMR. PINK\nOpen the fucking door!\n\nEXTREME C.U. DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW\n\nMr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.\n\n\n8      EXT. STREET - DAY\n\nDOLLY with Cops coming up fast.\n\nMr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.\n\nThe Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.\n\nUsing the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at\nthe Cops.\n\nEverybody HITS the ground, or scatters.\n\nMr. Pink HOPS in the car.\n\nCops FIRE.\n\n\n9      INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY\n\nCAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it.  SPEEDING down\nthe street, with the Cops FIRING after him.\n\nBACK TO:\n\n\n10     INT. BATHROOM - DAY\n\nMr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.\n\nMR. PINK\nTagged a couple of cops.  Did you\nkill anybody?\n\nMR. WHITE\nA few cops.\n\nMR. PINK\nNo real people?\n\nMR. WHITE\nUh-uh, just cops.\n\nMR. PINK\nCould you believe Mr. Blonde?\n\nMR. WHITE\nThat was one of the most insane\nfucking things I've ever seen.\nWhy the fuck would Joe hire\nsomebody like that?\n\nMR. PINK\nI don't wanna kill anybody.  But\nif I gotta get out that door, and\nyou're standing in my way, one way\nof the other, you're gettin outta\nmy way.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThat's the way I look at it.  A\nchoice between doin ten years, and\ntakin out some stupid\nmotherfucker, ain't no choice at\nall.  But I ain't no madman\neither.  What the fuck was Joe\nthinkin?  You can't work with a\nguy like that.  That mother-\nfucker's unstable.  What do you\nthink?  Do you think he panicked,\nor ya think he's just trigger-\nhappy?\n\nMR. PINK\nI think he's a sick fuckin maniac!\nWe're awful goddamn lucky he\ndidn't tag us, when\nhe shot up the place.  I came this\nfucking close--\n(hold up two fingers\nand makes a tiny\nspace between them)\n--to taking his ass out myself.\nEverybody panics.  When things get\ntense, everybody panics.\nEverybody.  I don't care what your\nname is, you can't help it.  It's\nhuman nature.  But ya panic on the\ninside.\nYa panic in your head.  Ya give\nyourself a couple a seconds of\npanic, then you get a grip and\ndeal with the situation.  What you\ndon't do, is shoot up the place\nand kill everybody.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat you're supposed to do is act\nlike a fuckin professional.  A\npsychopath is not a professional.\nYou can't work with a psychopath,\n'cause ya don't know what those\nsick assholes are gonna do next.\nI mean, Jesus Christ, how old do\nyou think that black girl was?\nTwenty, maybe twenty-one?\n\nMR. PINK\nDid ya see what happened to\nanybody else?\n\nMR. WHITE\nMe and Mr. Orange jumped in the\ncar and Mr. Brown floored it.\nAfter that, I don't know what went\ndown.\n\nMR. PINK\nAt that point it became every man\nfor himself.  As far as Mr. Blonde\nor Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't\ngot the foggiest.  Once\nI got out, I never looked back.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat do you think?\n\nMR. PINK\nWhat do I think?  I think the cops\ncaught them, or killed 'em.\n\nMR. WHITE\nNot even a chance they punched\nthrough?  You found a hole.\n\nMR. PINK\nYeah, and that was a fucking\nmiracle.  But if they did get\naway, where the fuck are they?\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou don't think it's possible, one\nof them got ahold of the diamonds\nand pulled a--\n\nMR. PINK\nNope.\n\nMR. WHITE\nHow can you be so sure?\n\nMR. PINK\nI got the diamonds.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhere?\n\nMR. PINK\nI got 'em, all right?\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhere?  Are they out in the car?\n\nMR. PINK\nNo, they're not in the car.  No, I\ndon't have them on me.  Ya wanna\ngo with me and get 'em?  Yes, we\ncan go right now.  But first\nlisten to what I'm telling you.\nWe were fuckin set up!  Somebody\nis in league with the cops.  We\ngot a Judas in our midst.  And I'm\nthinkin we should have our fuckin\nheads examined for waiting around\nhere.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThat was the plan, we meet here.\n\nMR. PINK\nThen where is everybody?  I say\nthe plan became null and void once\nwe found out we got a rat in the\nhouse.  We ain't got the slightest\nfuckin idea what happened to Mr.\nBlonde or Mr. Blue.  They could\nboth be dead\nor arrested.  They could be\nsweatin 'em, down at the station\nhouse right now.  Yeah they don't\nknow the names, but they can sing\nabout this place.\nI mean, that could be happening\nright now.  As we speak, the cops\ncould be in their cars, drivin\nhere this minute.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.\n\nMR. PINK\nWhat?\n\nMR. WHITE\nTwo jobs back, it was a four man\njob, we discovered one of the team\nwas an undercover cop.\n\nMR. PINK\nNo shit?\n\nMR. WHITE\nThank god, we discovered in time.\nWe hadda forget the whole fuckin\nthing.  Just walked away from it.\n\nMR. PINK\nSo who's the rat this time?  Mr.\nBlue?  Mr. Blonde?  Joe?  It's\nJoe's show, he set this whole\nthing up.  Maybe he set it up to\nset it up.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI don't buy it.  Me and Joe go\nback a long time.  I can tell ya\nstraight up, Joe definitely didn't\nhave anything to do with this\nbullshit.\n\nMR. PINK\nOh, you and Joe go back a long\ntime.  I known Joe since I was a\nkid.  But me saying Joe definitely\ncouldn't have done it is\nridiculous.  I can say I\ndefinitely didn't do it, cause I\nknow what I did or didn't do.  But\nI can't definitely say that about\nanybody else, 'cause I don't\ndefinitely know.  For all I know,\nyou're the rat.\n\nMR. WHITE\nFor all I know, you're the rat.\n\nMR. PINK\nNow you're using your head. For\nall we know, he's the rat.\n\nMr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange.  Mr. White's\nexpression changes.\n\nMR. WHITE\nJesus Christ!\n\n\n11     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\nThey run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious.  The\nCAMERA hovers over the action.  Mr. Pink reaches him\nfirst.\n\nMR. PINK\nIs he dead?\n\nMr. White pushes him out of the way.  He feels the pulse\non Mr. Orange's neck.\n\nMR. PINK\nSo, is he dead or what?\n\nMR. WHITE\nHe ain't dead.\n\nMR. PINK\nSo what is it?\n\nMR. WHITE\nI think he's just passed out.\n\nMR. PINK\nHe scared the fuckin shit outta\nme.  I thought he was dead fer\nsure.\n\nMr. White stands up and walks over to a table.\n\nMR. WHITE\nHe will be dead fer sure, if we\ndon't get him to a hospital.\n\nMR. PINK\nWe can't take him to a hospital.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWithout medical attention, this\nman won't live through the night.\nThat bullet in his belly is my\nfault.  Now while that might not\nmean jack shit to you, it means a\nhelluva lot to me.  And I'm not\ngonna just sit around and watch\nhim die.\n\nMR. PINK\nWell, first things first, staying\nhere's goofy.  We gotta book up.\n\nMR. WHITE\nSo what do you suggest, we go to a\nhotel?  We got a guy who's shot in\nthe belly, he can't walk, he\nbleeds like a stuck pig, and when\nhe's awake, he screams in pain.\n\nMR. PINK\nYou gotta idea, spit it out.\n\nMR. WHITE\nJoe could help him.  If we can get\nin touch with Joe, Joe could get\nhim to a doctor, Joe could get a\ndoctor to come and see him.\n\nDuring Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a\nC.U. of Mr. White.\n\nMR. PINK (OS)\nAssuming we can trust Joe, how we\ngonna get in touch with him?  He's\nsupposed to be here, but he ain't,\nwhich is making me nervous about\nbeing here.  Even if Joe is\non the up and up, he's probably\nnot gonna be that happy with us.\nJoe planned a robbery, but he's\ngot a blood bath on his hands now.\nDead cops, dead robbers, dead\ncivilians...Jesus Christ!  I tend\nto doubt he's gonna have a lot of\nsympathy for our plight.  If I was\nhim, I'd try and put as much\ndistance between me and this mess\nan humanly possible.\n\nMR. WHITE\nBefore you got here, Mr. Orange\nwas askin me to take him to a\nhospital.  Now I don't like\nturning him over to the cops, but\nif we don't, he's dead.  He begged\nme to do it.  I told him to hold\noff till Joe got here.\n\nMR. PINK (OS)\nWell Joe ain't gettin here.  We're\non our own.  Now, I don't know a\ngoddamn body who can help him, so\nif you know somebody, call 'em.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI don't know anybody.\n\nMR. PINK (OS)\nWell, I guess we drop him off at\nthe hospital.  Since he don't know\nnothin about us, I say it's his\ndecision.\n\n\nMR. WHITE'S POV:\n\nC.U. OF MR. PINK.\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nWell, he knows a little about me.\n\nMR. PINK\nYou didn't tell him your name, did\nya?\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nI told him my first name, and\nwhere I'm from.\n\nThere is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink,\nthen he SCREAMS:\n\nMR. PINK\nWhy!\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nI told him where I was from a few\ndays ago.  It was just a casual\nconversation.\n\nMR. PINK\nAnd what was tellin him your name\nwhen you weren't supposed to?\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nHe asked.\n\nMr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nWe had just gotten away from the\ncops.  He just got shot.  It was\nmy fuckin fault he got shot.  He's\na fuckin bloody mess - he's\nscreaming.  I swear to god, I\nthought we was gonna die right\nthen and there.  I'm tryin to\ncomfort him, telling him not to\nworry, he's gonna be okay, I'm\ngonna take care of him.  And he\nasked me what my name was.  I\nmean, the man was dyin in my arms.\nWhat the fuck was I supposed to\ntell him, \"Sorry, I can't give out\nthat information, it's against the\nrules.  I don't trust you\nenough.\"?  Maybe I shoulda, but I\ncouldn't.\n\nMR. PINK\nOh, I don't doubt is was quite\nbeautiful--\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nDon't fuckin patronize me.\n\nMR. PINK\nOne question: Do they have a sheet\non you, where you told him you're\nfrom?\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nOf course.\n\nMR. PINK\nWell that's that, then.  I mean, I\nwas worried about mug shot\npossibilities already.  But now he\nknows: (a) what you look like, (b)\nwhat your first name is,\n(i) where you're from and (d) what\nyour specialty is.\nThey ain't gonna hafta show him a\nhelluva lot of pictures for him to\npick you out.  That's it right,\nyou didn't tell him anything else\nthat could narrow down the\nselection?\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nIf I have to tell you again to\nback off, me an you are gonna go\nround and round.\n\nMr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr.\nWhite.  Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.\n\nMR. PINK\nWe ain't taking him to a hospital.\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nIf we don't, he'll die.\n\nMR. PINK\nAnd I'm very sad about that.  But\nsome fellas are lucky, and some\nain't.\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nThat fuckin did it!\n\nMr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.\n\nMr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in\nthe mouth.\n\nEND OF POV\n\nMr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and\nrealistic fight.  They go at each other like a couple of\nalley cats.\n\nAs Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:\n\nMR. WHITE\n\nYou little motherfucker!\n\nMr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:\n\nMR. PINK\nYa wanna fuck with me?!  You wanna\nfuck with me?!  I'll show you who\nyou're fuckin with!\n\nThe two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING.\n\nMr. White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.\n\nMr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it\nout.\n\nMr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink,\nand goes for his own weapon.\n\nThe two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their\nguns outstretched, aiming at one another.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou wanna shoot me, you little\npiece of shit?  Take a shot!\n\nMR. PINK\nFuck you, White!  I didn't create\nthis situation,  I'm just dealin\nwith it.  You're acting like a\nfirst-year fuckin thief.  I'm\nactin like a professional.  They\nget him, they can get you, they\nget you, they get closer to me,\nand that can't happen.  And you,\nyou motherfucker, are looking at\nme like it's my fault.  I didn't\ntell him my name.  I didn't tell\nhim where I was from.  I didn't\ntell him what I knew better than\nto tell him.  Fuck, fifteen\nminutes ago, you almost told me\nyour name.  You, buddy, are stuck\nin a situation you created.  So if\nyou wanna throw bad looks\nsomewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.\n\nMr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.\n\nMR. PINK\nSo if you wanna shoot somebody,\nput that gun in your mouth and\nshoot yourself.\n\nThen from OFF SCREEN we hear:\n\nVOICE (OS)\nYou kids don't play so rough.\nSomebody's gonna start crying.\n\n\n12     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM C.U. ON MR. BLONDE\n\nThe Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.\n\nMr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke\nand eating a hot dog.\n\nMR. PINK\nMr. Blonde!  You okay?  We thought\nyou might've gotten caught.  What\nhappened?\n\nMr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter\nand starts walking around the warehouse, checking the\nplace out.\n\nHe doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he\njust eats his hot dog and sips his coke.\n\nThis is making Pink and White nervous as hell.  But Mr.\nPink tries to talk through it.\n\nWe HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.\n\nMR. PINK\nReally, how did you get away?\n\nMr. Blonde walks the loft.  Silent.\n\nMR. PINK\nYou saw what happened to me,\nI found a hole and booked.\n\nSilence.\n\nMR. PINK\nWhere's Mr. Blue?\n\nBlonde looks in the bathroom.\n\nMR. PINK\nWe were hopin you two would be\ntogether.\n\nBlonde looks out the window.\n\nMR. PINK\nThat was the big question we had,\nwhat happened to Mr.\nBlue and you?\n\nBlonde walks away from the window.\n\nMR. PINK\nWe were worried the cops got ya.\n\nBlonde bends down over Mr. Orange.\n\nMR. PINK\nHe got it in the belly.  He's\nstill alive, but won't be for\nlong.\n\nMR. WHITE\nEnough!  You better start talkin\nto us, asshole, cause we got shit\nwe need to talk about.  We're\nalready freaked out, we need you\nactin freaky like we need a fuckin\nbag on our hip.\n\nMr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves\ntowards them.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nSo, talk.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWe think we got a rat in the\nhouse.\n\nMR. PINK\nI guarantee we got a rat in the\nhouse.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nWhat would ever make you think\nthat?\n\nMR. WHITE\nIs that supposed to be funny?\n\nMR. PINK\nWe don't think this place is safe.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThis place just ain't secure\nanymore.  We're leaving, and you\nshould go with us.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nNobody's going anywhere.\n\nSilence takes over the room.  Mr. Blonde stops moving.\n\nAfter a few beats the silence is broken.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(to Mr. Pink)\nPiss on this turd, we're outta\nhere.\n\nMr. White turns to leave.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nDon't take another step, Mr.\nWhite.\n\nMr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards\nMr. Blonde.\n\nMR. WHITE\nFuck you, maniac!  It's your\nfuckin fault we're in so much\ntrouble.\n\nMr. Blonde calmly sits down.  He looks to Mr. Pink.\n\nMR. BLONDE\n(referring to Mr.\nWhite)\nWhat's this guy's problem?\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat's my problem?  Yeah, I gotta\nproblem.  I gotta big problem with\nany trigger-happy madman who\nalmost gets me shot!\n\nMR. BLONDE\nWhat're you talkin about?\n\nMR. WHITE\nThat fuckin shooting spree in the\nstore.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nFuck 'em, they set off the alarm,\nthey deserve what they got.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou almost killed me, asshole!  If\nI had any idea what type of guy\nyou were, I never would've agreed\nto work with you.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nYou gonna back all day, little\ndoggie, or are you gonna bite?\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat was that?  I'm sorry, I\ndidn't catch it.  Would you repeat\nit?\n\nMR. BLONDE\n(slowly)\nI said: \"Are you gonna bark all\nday, dog, or are you gonna bite.\"\n\nMR. PINK\nBoth of you two assholes knock it\nthe fuck off and calm down!\n\nMR. WHITE\n(to Mr. Blonde)\nSo you wanna git bit, huh?\n\nMR. PINK\nCut the bullshit, we ain't on a\nfuckin playground!\n(pause)\nI don't believe this shit, both of\nyou got ten years on me, and I'm\nthe only one actin like a\nprofessional.  You guys act like a\nbunch of fuckin niggers.  You ever\nwork a job with a bunch of\nniggers?  They're just like you\ntwo, always fightin, always sayin\nthey're gonna kill one another.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(to Mr. Pink)\nYou said yourself, you\nthought about takin him out.\n\nMR. PINK\nThen.  That time has passed.\nRight now, Mr. Blonde is the only\none I completely trust.  He's too\nfuckin homicidal to be workin with\nthe cops.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou takin his side?\n\nMR. PINK\nFuck sides!  What we need is a\nlittle solidarity here.\nSomebody's stickin a red hot poker\nup our asses and we gotta find out\nwhose hand's on the handle.

So let's figure out\nwho's the bad guy.\n\nMr. White calms down and puts his gun away.\n\nMr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning,\ntalking about Madonna.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nWell, that was sure exciting.\n(to Mr. White)\nYou're a big Lee Marvin fan,\naren't you?  Me too.  I don't know\nabout the rest of you fellas, but\nmy heart's\nbeatin fast.\n(pause for a beat)\nOkay you guys, follow me.\n\nMr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.\n\nThe other two men just follow him with their eyes.\n\nMR.

He's\non his way down here, and nobody's\ngoing anywhere till be gets here.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou talked to Nice Guy Eddie?  Why\nthe fuck didn't you say that in\nthe first place?\n\nMR.

Okay, fellas, take a\nlook at the little surprise I\nbrought you.\n\nMr. Blonde opens up the truck of his car.  A handcuffed,\nuniformed POLICEMAN is curled up inside the trunk.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nSo while we're waitin for Nice Guy\nEddie, what say we have a little\nfun finding out who the rat is.\n\n\nINSERT: TITLE CARD \"MR. BLONDE\".\n\n\n14     INT.

But when Vic\nasked me how's business, well, you\ndon't lie to a man who's just done\nfour years in the slammer for ya.\n\nEddie bobs his head up and down.\n\nEDDIE\nOh really, is that a fact?\n\nEddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.\n\nThe two friends, laughing and cussing at each other,\nwrestle on the floor of Joe's office.\n\nJoe's on his feet yelling at them.\n\nJOE\n(yelling)\nOkay, okay, enough, enough!\nPlaytime's over!  You wanna roll\naround on the floor, do it in\nEddie's office, not mine!\n\nThe two men break it up.  They are completely disheveled,\nhair a mess, shirttails out.  As they get themselves\ntogether, they continue to taunt one another.\n\nEDDIE\nDaddy, did ya see that?\n\nJOE\nWhat?\n\nEDDIE\nGuy got me on the ground, tried to\nfuck me.\n\nVIC\nYou fuckin wish.\n\nEDDIE\nYou tried to fuck me in my\nfather's office, you sick bastard.\nLook, Vic, whatever you wanna do\nin the privacy of your own home,\ngo do it.  But don't try to fuck\nme.  I don't think of you that\nway.  I mean, I like you a lot--\n\nVIC\nEddie, if I was a pirate, I\nwouldn't throw you to the crew.\n\nEDDIE\nNo, you'd keep me for yourself.\nFour years fuckin punks in the ass\nmade you appreciate prime rib when\nyou get it.\n\nVIC\nI might break you, Nice Guy, but\nI'd make you my dog's bitch.\nYou'd be suckin the dick and going\ndown on a mangy T-bone hound.\n\nEDDIE\nNow ain't that a sad sight, daddy,\nwalks into jail a white man, walks\nout talkin like a nigger.  It's\nall that black semen been shootin\nup his butt.  It's backed up into\nhis brain and comes out of his\nmouth.\n\nJOE\nAre you two finished?

We got a\nbig problem we're tryin to solve.\nNow Eddie, would you like to sit\ndown and help us solve it, or do\nyou two wanna piss fart around?\n\nPlaytime is over and Vic and Eddie know it.  So they both\ntake seats in front of Joe's desk.\n\nJOE\nNow Vic was tellin me, he's got a\nparole problem.\n\nEDDIE\nReally?  Who's your P.O.?\n\nVIC\nCraig Koons.\n\nEDDIE\nKoons?  Oh shit, I hear he's a\nmotherfucker.\n\nVIC\nHe is a motherfucker.

We can\ngive you a lot of legitimate jobs.\nPut you on the rotation at Long\nBeach as a dock worker.\n\nVIC\nI don't wanna lift crates.\n\nEDDIE\nYou don't hafta lift shit.  You\ndon't really work there.  But as\nfar as the records are concerned,\nyou do.  I call up Matthews, the\nforeman, tell him he's got a new\nguy.  You're on the schedule.  You\ngot a timecard, it's clocked in\nand out for you everyday, and you\nget a pay check at the end of the\nweek.  And ya know dock workers\ndon't do too bad.  So you can move\ninto a halfway decent place\nwithout Koons thinkin \"what the\nfuck.\"  And if Koons ever wants to\nmake a surprise visit, you're gone\nthat day.  That day we sent you to\nTustin.  We gotta bunch of shit\nyou needed to unload there.\nYou're at the Taft airstrip pickin\nup a bunch of shit and bringing it\nback.  Part of your jab is goin\ndifferent places - and we got\nplaces all over the place.\n\nJOE\n(to Vic)\nDidn't I tell ya not to worry?\n(to Eddie)\nVic was worried.\n\nEDDIE\nMe and you'll drive down to Long\nBeach tomorrow.  I'll introduce\nyou to Matthews, tell him what's\ngoing on.\n\nVIC\nThat's great, guy, thanks a bunch.\n(pause)\nWhen do you think you'll need me\nfor real work?\n\nJOE\nWell, it's kinda a strange time\nright now.

Ya know he can\nhandle himself, ya know you can\ntrust him.\n\nJoe looks at Vic.\n\nVic has no idea what they're talking about.\n\nJOE\nHow would you feel about pullin a\nheist with about five other guys?\n\nVIC\nWhat's the exposure like?\n\nJOE\nTwo minutes, tops.  It's a tough\ntwo minutes.  It's a hold up,\ndaylight, during business hours,\ndealing with a crowd.  But you\nhave the fellas to deal with the\ncrowd.  It's a jewelry store.\nThey're getting a big shipment of\nSouth African diamonds on a\ncertain day.  They're like a way\nstation.  It's gonna get picked up\nthe next day and sent to Hamburg.\nWhen you walk through the door,\nyou'll know right where to go for\nthe rich stones.\nThe fellas are good, me and Nice\nGuy picked em.

And I'll bet you\neverything from a diddle-eyed Joe\nto a damned-if-I-know, that in\nMilwaukee they got a sheet on this\nMr. White motherfucker's ass.  I\nwant you to go through the mugs of\nguys from old Milwaukee with a\nhistory of armed robbery, and put\na name to that face.\n\nHoldaway takes a big bite out of his burger.\n\nHOLDAWAY\n(with his mouth full)\nWhat kinds questions did Cabot\nask?\n\nFREDDY\nWhere I was from, who I knew, how\nI knew Nice Guy, had I done time,\nshit like that.\n\nHoldaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now.  He\nmotions for Freddy to elaborate.\n\nFREDDY\nHe asked me if I ever done armed\nrobbery before.  I read him my\ncredits.  I robbed a few gas and\nsips, sold some weed, told him\nrecently I held the shotgun while\nme and another guy pulled down a\npoker game in Portland.\n\nCAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CU.\n\nHOLDAWAY (O.S.)\nDidja use the commode story?\n\nFREDDY\nFuckin-A.  I tell it real good,\ntoo.\n\n\n28     INT.  MEN'S ROOM - L.A. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT\n\nFreddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous.\nHoldaway wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt.  Freddy\nsits on one of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket,\nlooking at pieces of paper stapled together.\n\nFREDDY\nWhat's this?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nIt's a scene.  Memorize it.\n\nFREDDY\nWhat?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nA undercover cop has got to be\nMarlon Brando.  To do this job you\ngot to be a great actor.  You got\nto be naturalistic.  You got to be\nnaturalistic as hell.  If you\nain't a great actor you're a bad\nactor, and bad acting is bull shit\nin this job.\n\nFREDDY\n(referring to the\npapers)\nBut what is this?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nIt's a amusing anecdote about a\ndrug deal.\n\nFREDDY\nWhat?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nSomething funny that happened to\nyou while you were doing a job.\n\nFREDDY\nI gotta memorize all this shit?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nIt's like a joke.  You remember\nwhat's important, and the rest you\nmake your own.  The only way to\nmake it your own is to keep sayin\nit, and sayin it, and sayin it,\nand sayin it, and sayin it.\n\nFREDDY\nI can do that.\n\nHOLDAWAY\nThe things you gotta remember are\nthe details.  It's the details\nthat sell your story.  Now this\nstory takes place in this men's\nroom.  So you gotta know the\ndetails about this men's room.\nYou gotta know they got a blower\ninstead of a towel to dry your\nhands.  You gotta know the stalls\nain't got no doors.  You gotta\nknow whether they got liquid or\npowdered soap, whether they got\nhot water or not, 'cause if you do\nyour job when you tell your story,\neverybody should believe it.  And\nif you tell your story to somebody\nwho's actually taken a piss in\nthis men's room, and you get one\ndetail they remember right,\nthey'll swear by you.\n\n\n29     INT.  FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nFreddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame,\nrehearsing the anecdote.  He's reading it pretty good, but\nhe's still reading it from the page, and every once in a\nwhile he stumbles over his words.\n\nFREDDY\n...this was during the Los Angeles\nmarijuana drought of '86.  I still\nhad a connection.  Which was\ninsane, 'cause you couldn't get\nweed anyfuckinwhere then.  Anyway,\nI had a connection with this\nhippie chick up in Santa Cruz.\nAll and my friends knew it.  And\nthey'd give me a call and say,\n\"Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you\nthink you could buy me some too?\"\nThey knew I smoked, so they'd ask\nme to buy a little for them when I\nwas buyin.  But it got to be\neverytime I bought some weed, I\nwas buyin for four or five\ndifferent people.  Finally I said,\n\"Fuck this shit.\"  I'm makin this\nbitch rich.  She didn't have to do\njack shit, she never even had to\nmeet these people.  I was fuckin\ndoin all the work.  So I got\ntogether with her and told her,\n\"Hey, I'm sick of this shit.  I'm\ncomin through for everybody, and\nnobody's comin through for me.\nSo, either I'm gonna tell all my\nfriends to find their own source,\nor you give me a bunch of weed,\nI'll sell it to them, give you the\nmoney, minus ten percent, and I\nget my pot for free.\"  So, I did\nif for awhile...\n\nFreddy exits frame\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n30     EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY\n\nAnother empty frame, except obviously outside.  Freddy\nenters frame from the same direction he exited in the\nprevious scene, finishing his sentence.  When we move to a\nwider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to\nHoldaway in a parking lot.  Holdaway sits on the hood of\nhis beat-up car.  Freddy paces back and forth as he\nperforms his story.\n\nFREDDY\n...but then that got to be a pain\nin the ass.  People called me on\nthe phone all the fuckin time.  I\ncouldn't rent a fuckin tape\nwithout six phone calls\ninterrupting me.  \"Hey, Freddy,\nwhen's the next time you're gettin\nsome?\"  \"Motherfucker, I'm tryin\nto watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have\nsome, I'll let you know.\"  And\nthen these rinky-dink pot heads\ncome by--there's my friends and\neverything, but still.  I got all\nmy shit laid out in sixty dollar\nbags.  Well, they don't want sixty\ndollars worth.  They want ten\ndollars worth.  Breaking it up is\na major fuckin pain in the ass.  I\ndon't even know how much ten\ndollars worth is.  \"Well, fuck,\nman, I don't want that much\naround.  If I have that much\naround I'll smoke it.\"  \"Hey, if\nyou guys can't control your\nsmokin, that's not my problem.\nYou motherfuckers been smokin for\nfive years, be a adult about it.\"\nFinally I just told my connection,\ncount me out.  But as it turns\nout, I'm the best guy she had, and\nshe depended alot on my business.\nBut I was still sick to death of\nit.  And she's trying to talk me\ninto not quitin.\nNow this was a very weird\nsituation, 'cause I don't know if\nyou remember back in '86, there\nwas a major fuckin drought.\nNobody and anything.  People were\nlivin on resin and smokin the wood\nin their pipes for months.  And\nthis chick had a bunch, and was\nbeggin me to sell it.  So I told\nher I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot\nMan anymore.  But I would take a\nlittle bit and sell it to my\nclose, close, close friends.  She\nagreed to that, and said we'd keep\nthe same arrangement as before,\nten percent and free pot for me,\nas long as I helped her out that\nweekend.  She had a brick of weed\nshe was sellin, and she didn't\nwant to go to the buy alone...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n31     INT.  BOOTS AND SOCKS BAR - NIGHT\n\nFreddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a\ntable in a red-lighted smokey bar.  Freddy continues his\nstory.  The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.\n\nFREDDY\n...Her brother usually goes with\nher, but he's in county\nunexpectedly.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat for?\n\nFREDDY\nTraffic tickets gone to warrant.\nThey stopped him for something,\nfound the warrants on 'im, took\n'im to jail.  She doesn't want to\nwalk around alone with all that\nweed.  Well, I don't wanna do\nthis, I have a bad feeling about\nit, but she keeps askin me, keeps\naskin me, finally I said okay\n'cause I'm sick of listening to\nit.  Well, we're picking this guy\nup at the train station.\n\nJOE\nYou're picking the buyer up at the\ntrain station?  You're carrying\nthe weed on you?\n\nFREDDY\nYeah, the guy needed it right\naway.  Don't ask me why.  So we\nget to the train station, and\nwe're waitin for the guy.  Now I'm\ncarrying the weed in one of those\ncarry-on bags, and I gotta take a\npiss.  So I tell the connection\nI'll be right back, I'm goin' to\nthe little boys room...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n32     INT.  MEN'S ROOM - TRAIN STATION - DAY\n\nMEDIUM ON FREDDY\n\nHe walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his\nshoulder.  Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks.  We\nmove into a CU.\n\nFREDDY (V.O.)\n...So I walk into the men's room,\nand who's standing there?\n\nFREEZE FRAME\n\non Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles County\nSheriffs and one German Shepherd.  All of their eyes are\non Freddy.  Everyone is frozen.\n\nFREDDY (V.O.)\n...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs\nand a German Shepherd.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE (V.O.)\nThey were waiting for you?\n\nFREDDY (V.O.)\nNo.  They were just a bunch of\ncops hangin out in the men's room,\ntalkin.  When I walked through the\ndoor they all stopped what they\nwere talking about and looked at\nme.\n\n\n33     BACK TO BAR\n\nECU MR. WHITE\n\nMR. WHITE\nThat's hard, man.  That's a fuckin\nhard situation.\n\n\n34     BACK TO MEN'S ROOM\n\nECU GERMAN SHEPHERD\n\nbarking his head off.\n\nFREDDY (V.O.)\nThe German Shepherd starts\nbarkin'.  He's barkin' at me.  I\nmean it's obvious he's barkin' at\nme.\n\nWe do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room.  We can\nhear the dog barking.\n\nFREDDY (V.O.)\nEvery nerve ending, all of my\nsenses, the blood in my veins,\neverything I has was screaming,\n\"Take off, man, just take off, get\nthe fuck outta there!\"  Panic hit\nme like a bucket of water.  First\nthere was the shock of it--BAM,\nright in the face!  Then I'm just\nstandin there drenched in panic.\n\nSLOW MOTION\n\nCAMERA does a PAN from face to face of the sheriffs.\n\nFREDDY (V.O.)\nAnd all those sheriffs are lookin\nat me and they know. They can\nsmell it.  As sure as that fuckin\ndog cam, they can smell it on me.\n\nFREEZE FRAME\n\nBack to the same freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in\nfront of the sheriffs.  It suddenly jerks to life, and\nmoves to speed.  The dog is barking.  Freddy moves to his\nright, out of frame.  We stay on the sheriffs.  One\nsheriff yells at the dog.\n\nSHERIFF #1\nShut up!\n\nThe dog quiets down.  Sheriff #2 continues with his story.\nA couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen,\nbut as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him.\n\nSHERIFF #2\nSo my gun's drawn, right?  I got\nit aimed right at him.  I tell\n'em, \"Freeze, don't fuckin move.\"\nAnd the little idiot's lookin at\nme, nodding his head \"Yes,\" sayin\n\"I know...I know...I know.\"\nMeanwhile his right hand is\ncreepin towards his glove box.  So\nI scream at him, \"Asshole, you\nbetter fuckin freeze right now!\"\nAnd he's still lookin right at me,\nsaying\n\"I know...I know...I know.\"  And\nhis right hand's still going for\nthe glove box.\n\nThe CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up\nagainst the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.\n\nSHERIFF #2 (O.S.)\nI tell 'im, \"Buddy, I'm gonna\nshoot you in the face right now if\nyou don't put your hands on the\nfuckin dash.\"  And the guy's\ngirlfriend, a real sexy Oriental\nbitch, starts screamin at him,\n\"Chuck, are you out of your mind?\nPut your hands on the dash like\nthe officer said.\"  And then like\nnothing, the guy snaps out of it\nand casually puts his hands on the\ndash.\n\nFreddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past\nthe sheriffs over to the sink.  The CAMERA PANS with him.\nA sheriff is sitting on a sink.  He looks down and watches\nFreddy wash his hands.\n\nSHERIFF #1\nWhat was he goin for?\n\nSHERIFF #2\nHis registration.  Stupid fuckin\ncitizen, doesn't have the\nslightest idea how close he came\nto gettin shot.\n\nFreddy finishes washing his hands.  He goes to dry them,\nbut there's only those hand drying machines.  Freddy turns\non the drying machine.  He can't hear anything the\nsheriffs say now.  The sound of the machine dominates the\nsound track.\n\nThese following shots are SLOW MOTION.\n\nCU OF FREDDY\n\nCU of his HANDS, rubbing each other getting blown dry\n\nSHOT OF SHERIFFS talking.  We can't hear them because of\nthe machine.\n\nCU OF MACHINE\n\nMEDIUM OF SHERIFF ON SINK, smoking a cigarette, glancing\nover at Freddy.\n\nCU OF GERMAN SHEPHERD\n\nMachine turns off.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n35     INT.

HOLDAWAY'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nHoldaway sits behind his desk.  Freddy sits on the edge of\nthe desk eating a Double-Double with cheese.  They look\ninto the CAMERA.\n\nWe hear Jodie's voice OFFSCREEN.\n\nJODIE (OS)\nLawrence \"Larry\" Dimick.  Also\nknown as Lawrence Jacobs and Alvin\n\"Al\" Jacobs.  This guy is Mr. Joe-\nArmed-Robbery.  He's\na pro and he makes it a habit not\nto get caught.\n\n\nMEDIUM SHOT OF JODIE\n\nDOLLY slowly into C.U.\n\nJODIE\nHe's only been convicted twice,\nwhich is pretty good for somebody\nliving a life of crime.  Once for\narmed robbery, when he was twenty-\none, in Milwaukee.\n\n\nC.U. FREDDY\n\nFREDDY\nWhat was it?\n\n\nJODIE\n\nJODIE\nPayroll office at a lumber yard.\nFirst offense - he got eighteen\nmonths.  He didn't get busted\nagain until he was thirty-two.\nAnd then it was a backdoor bust.\nA routine vice squad roust.  They\nroust this bar, out buddy Lawrence\nis in there knocking down a few.\nHe gets picked up.  He's wearing\non his person an outlaw .45\nautomatic, apparently his weapon\nof choice.  Also, on his finger is\na diamond ring from a jewelry\nstore robbery a year earlier.  He\ngot two years back inside for\nthat.\n\n\nTWO SHOT OF HOLDAWAY AND FREDDY\n\nFreddy winces.\n\nFREDDY\nGoddamn, that's hard time.\n\n\nJODIE\n\nJODIE\nSo far, it's the only time he's\never done.\n\n\nCU HOLDAWAY\n\nHOLDAWAY\nWas this vice squad bullshit in\nMilwaukee?\n\n\nJODIE\n\nJODIE\nNo.  The vice squad roust was in\nL.A.  He's been in Los Angeles\nsince '77.\n\n\nDOLLY BEHIND HOLDAWAY'S DESK\n\nfrom left to right.\n\nFREDDY\nWhen did he do this time?\n\nJODIE\nBack in '83, got out late '86.  I\nfound something else out I think\nyou two should be aware of.\nAbout a year and a half ago, up in\nSacramento, an undercover cop,\nJohn Dolenz, worked his way into a\nbank job.  Apparently before the\njob they found out he was a cop.\nNow picture this:  It's Dolenz's\nbirthday, a bunch of cops are\nwaiting in his apartment for a\nsurprise party.  The door opens,\neveryone yells \"Surprise!\", and\nstanding in the doorway is Dolenz\nand this other guy sticking a gun\nin Dolenz's ribs.  Before anybody\nknows what's going on, this\nstranger shoots Dolenz dead and\nstarts firing two .45 automatics\ninto the crowd.\n\nHOLDAWAY\nWhat happened?\n\nThe DOLLY moves behind Jodie.\n\nJODIE\nIt was a mess.  Cops got hit,\nwives got hit, girlfriends got\nhit, his dog got hit.  People got\nglass in their faces.  Three were\nkilled, six were wounded.\n\nFREDDY\nThey couldn't pin the killing on\none of the bank robbers?\n\nJODIE\nThey tried, but they didn't have a\npositive I.D. and all those guys\nhad alibis.  Besides, we really\ndidn't have anything on them.  We\nhad the testimony of a dead man\nthat they were talking\nabout committing a robbery.  They\nnever went ahead with the bank\njob.\n\nThe DOLLY completes its circle.\n\nFREDDY\nAnd Larry Dimick was one of the\nboys?\n\nJODIE\nHe was probably the one.\n\n\nON HOLDAWAY\n\nHOLDAWAY\nJust how sure are you with your\ncover?\n\nPAN to C.U. on Freddy.\n\nFREDDY\nToday they may know something,\ntomorrow they may know something\nelse.

PINK\nYeah, those guys too.\n\nEDDIE\nLet me tell you guys a story.  In\none of daddy's clubs there was\nthis black cocktail waitress named\nElois.\n\nMR. WHITE\nElois?\n\nEDDIE\nYeah, Elois. E and Lois.  We\ncalled her Lady E.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhere was she from, Compton?\n\nEDDIE\nNo.  She was from Ladora Heights.\n\nMR. PINK\nThe black Beverly Hills.  I knew\nthis lady from Ladora Heights\nonce.\n(in a stuck up black\nfemale voice)\n\"Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's\nthe black Beverly Hills.\"\nEDDIE\nIt's not the black Beverly Hills,\nit's the black Palos Verdes.\nAnyway, this chick, Elois, was a\nman-eater-upper.  I bet every guy\nwho's ever met her has jacked off\nto her at least once.  You know\nwho she looked like?  Christie\nLove.  'Member that TV show \"Get\nChristie Love\"?  She was a black\nfemale cop.  She always used to\nsay \"You're under arrest, sugar.\"\n\nMR. PINK\nI was in the sixth grade when that\nshow was on.  I totally dug it.\nWhat the fuck was the name of the\nchick who played Christie\nLove?\n\nEDDIE\nPam Grier.\n\nMR. PINK\nNo, it wasn't Pan Grier, Pan Grier\nwas the other one.  Pan Grier made\nthe movies.  Christie Love was\nlike a Pam Grier TV show, without\nPam Grier.\n\nMR. PINK\nWhat the fuck was that chick's\nname?  Oh this is just great, I'm\ntotally fuckin tortured now.\n\nEDDIE\nWell, whoever she was, Elois\nlooked like her.  So one night I\nwalk into the club, and no Elois.\nNow the bartender was a wetback,\nhe was a friend of mine, his name\nwas Carlos.\nSo I asked him \"Hey, Carlos,\nwhere's Lady E tonight?\"  Well\napparently Lady E was married to\nthis real piece of dog shit.  I\nmean a real animal.  And\napparently he would so things to\nher.\n\nFREDDY\n\nDo things?  What would he do?  You\nmean like beat her up?\n\nEDDIE\nNobody knows for sure what he did.\nWe just know he did something.\nAnyway, Elois plays it real cool.\nAnd waits for the next time this\nbag of shit gets drunk.  So one\nnight the guy gets drunk and\npasses out on the couch.  So while\nthe guy's\ninebriated, she strips him naked.\nThen she takes some crazy glue and\nglues his dick to his belly.\n\nThe car reacts to how horrible that would be.\n\nEDDIE\nI'm dead fuckin serious.  She put\nsome on his dick and some on his\nbelly, then stuck 'em together.\nThe paramedics had to come and cut\nit loose.\n\nThe car reacts badly.\n\nMR. WHITE\nJesus Christ!\n\nFREDDY\nYou can do some crazy things with\nit.\n\nEDDIE\nI don't know what he did to her,\nbut she got even.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWas he all pissed off?\n\nMR. PINK\nHow would you feel if you had to\ndo a handstand every time you took\na piss.\n\nThe car laughs.\n\n\n42     EXT.

You guys don't say shit\nabout who you are, where you been\nor what you've done.  Only thing\nyou guys can talk about is what\nyou're going to do.  This way the\nonly ones who know who the members\nof the team are are Eddie and\nmyself.  And that's the way I like\nit.  Because in the unlikely event\nof one of you getting apprehended\nby the cops, not that I expect\nthat to happen - it most\ndefinitely should not happen - it\nhasn't happened, you don't have\nanything to deal with.  You don't\nknow any names.  You know my name,\nyou know Eddie's name.  That I\ndon't care about.  You gotta prove\nit.  I ain't worried.  Besides,\nthis way you gotta trust me.  I\nlike that.  I set this up and\npicked the men I wanted for it.\nNone of you came to me, I\napproached all of you.  I know\nyou.  I know your work, I know\nyour reputation.  I know you as\nmen.  Except for this guy.\n\nJoe points a finger at Freddy.\n\nFreddy shits a brick.\n\nJOE\nBut he's OK.  If he wasn't OK, he\nwouldn't be here.  Okay, let me\nintroduce everybody to everybody.\nBut once again, at the risk of\nbeing redundant, if I even think I\nhear somebody telling or referring\nto somebody by their Christian\nname...\n(Joe searches for the\nright words)\n...you won't want to be you.\nOkay, quickly.\n(pointing at the men\nas he gives them a\nname)\nMr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde,\nMr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr.\nPink.\n\nMR. PINK\nWhy am I Mr. Pink?\n\nJOE\nCause you're a faggot.\n\nEverybody laughs.\n\nMR. PINK\nWhy can't we pick out our own\ncolors?\n\nJOE\nI tried that once, it don't work.\nYou get four guys fighting over\nwho's gonna be Mr. Black.  Since\nnobody knows anybody else, nobody\nwants to back down.  So forget it,\nI pick.  Be thankful you're not\nMr. Yellow.\n\nMR. BROWN\nYeah, but Mr. Brown?  That's too\nclose to Mr. Shit.\n\nEverybody laughs.\n\nMR. PINK\nYeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr.\nPussy.  Tell you what, let me be\nMr. Purple.  That sounds good to\nme, I'm Mr. Purple.\n\nJOE\nYou're not Mr. Purple, somebody\nfrom another job's Mr. Purple.\nYou're Mr. Pink.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWho cares what your name is?  Who\ncares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr.\nPurple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...\n\nMR. PINK\nOh that's really easy for you to\nsay, you're Mr. White.  You gotta\ncool-sounding name.  So tell me,\nMr. White, if you think \"Mr. Pink\"\nis no big deal, you wanna trade?\n\nJOE\nNobody's trading with anybody!\nLook, this ain't a goddamn fuckin\ncity counsel meeting!  Listen up\nMr. Pink.  We got two ways here,\nmy way or the highway.  And you\ncan go down either of 'em.  So\nwhat's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?\n\nMR. PINK\nJesus Christ, Joe.  Fuckin forget\nit.  This is beneath me.  I'm Mr.\nPink, let's move on.\n\nCAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard\nwith the layout of the jewelry store on it.\n\nJOE (OS)\nOkay fellas, let's get into this.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n44     EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY\n\nFreddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty\nlittle league baseball field.\n\nHOLDAWAY\nOkay, we're gonna station men\nacross the street from Karina's\nFine Jewelry.  But their orders\nwill be not to move in unless the\nrobbery gets out of control.  You\ngotta make sure they don't have to\nmove in.  You're inside to make\nsure that everything goes\naccording to Hoyle.  We have men\nset up a block away from the\nwarehouse rendezvous.  They got\ncomplete visibility of the\nexterior.  So as soon as Joe Cabot\nshows up, we'll see it.\n\nFREDDY\nWhat's your visibility of the\ninterior?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nWe can't see shit on the inside.\nAnd we can't risk gettin any\ncloser for fear they'll spot us.\n\nFREDDY\nThis is bullshit, Jim.  I get all\nthe fuckin danger of having you\nguys in my back pocket but none of\nthe safety.\n\nHOLDAWAY\nWhat's the matter, Newendyke?  Job\ntoo tough for ya?  No one lied to\nyou.  You always knew we'd hang\nback until Joe Cabot showed up.\n\nFREDDY\nOh this is great.  You ain't\ngiving me no fuckin protection\nwhatsoever.  But you are giving me\nan attitude.\n\nHOLDAWAY\nSince when does an undercover cop\nhave protection?  Freddy, you came\ninto this thing with your eyes\nwide open, so don't start screamin\nblind man now.  I understand\nyou're nervous.  I wish the\nwarehouse had more visible\nwindows, but it doesn't.  We have\nto make do with the cards we're\ndealt.\n\nFREDDY\nI didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.\nI'm just remarking on how shitty\nthe situation is!\n\nHOLDAWAY\nI don't mean to be harsh with ya,\nbut I've found tough love works\nbest in these situations.  We have\nto get Joe Cabot in the company of\nthe thieves and in the same\nvicinity as the loot.\nWe don't care about these other\nbastards.  We're willing to offer\nthem good deals to testify against\nCabot.\n\nFREDDY\nIsn't this risk unorthodox?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nWhat?\n\nFREDDY\nLetting them go ahead with the\nrobbery?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nThe whole idea behind this\noperation is to catch Joe Cabot\nred-handed.  We bust these hired\nhands, we ain't accomplished shit.\nLetting them go through with the\nheist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs\nare very clean.  We got people\nsurrounding the perimeter.  We got\na guy and a gal on the inside\nposing as a couple shopping for\nrings.  We could replace the\nemployees with cops, but we'd run\nthe risk of tipping 'em off.\n\nFREDDY\nThat's out.  They know the faces\nof who works what shift.\n\nHOLDAWAY\nThese guys are professionals.\nWe're professionals.  It's a risk,\nbut I think it's a calculated\nrisk.\n\n\n45     EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY\n\nWe see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.\n\nCUSTOMERS coming and going.  STORE CLERKS waiting on\ncustomers through the windows.\n\nWhile we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr.\nWhite and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.\n\nMR. WHITE (VO)\nLet's go over it.  Where are you?\n\nFREDDY (VO)\nI stand outside and guard the\ndoor.  I don't let anybody come in\nor go out.\n\nMR. WHITE (VO)\nMr. Brown?\n\nFREDDY (VO)\nMr. Brown stays in the car.  He's\nparked across the street till I\ngive him the signal, then he pulls\nup in front of the store.\n\nMR. WHITE (VO)\nMr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?\n\nFREDDY (VO)\nCrowd control.  They handle\ncustomers and employees in the\ndisplay area.\n\n\n46     INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY\n\nMr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street\nfrom the jewelry store, staking it out.\n\nMR. WHITE\nMyself and Mr. Pink?\n\nFREDDY\nYou two take the manager in the\nback and make him give you the\ndiamonds.  We're there for those\nstones, period.  Since no display\ncases are being fucked with, no\nalarms should go off.  We're out\nof there in two minutes, not one\nsecond longer.  What if the\nmanager won't give up the\ndiamonds?\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhen you're dealing with a store\nlike this, they're insured up the\nass.  They're not supposed to give\nyou and resistance\nwhatsoever.  If you get a customer\nor an employee who thinks he's\nCharles Bronson, take the butt of\nyour gun and smash their nose in.\nDrops 'em right to the floor.\nEveryone jumps, he falls down,\nscreaming, blood squirts out his\nnose.  Freaks everybody out.\nNobody says fuckin shit after\nthat.  You might get some bitch\ntalk shit to ya.  But give her a\nlook, like you're gonna smash her\nin the face next.  Watch her shut\nthe fuck up.  Now if it's a\nmanager, that's a different story.\nThe managers know better than to\nfuck around.  So if one's givin\nyou static, he probably thinks\nhe's a real cowboy.  So what you\ngotta do is break that son-of-a-\nbitch in two.  If you wanna know\nsomething and he won't tell you,\ncut off one of his fingers.  The\nlittle one.  Then you tell 'im his\nthumb's next.  After that he'll\ntell ya if he wears ladies\nunderwear.  I'm hungry, let's get\na taco.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n47     EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\nIt's the moment of the robbery.  The alley is empty.\n\nIn the distance we hear all hell breaking loose.  Guns\nFIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING,\nglass BREAKING...\n\nA car whips around the corner, into the alley.\n\nThe doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.\n\nFreddy opens the driver's side door.  A bloody SCREAMING\nMr. Brown FALLS out.\n\nMR. BROWN\n(screaming)\nMy eyes!  My eyes!  I'm blind, I'm\nfucking blind!\n\nFREDDY\nYou're not blind, there's just\nblood in your eyes.\n\nMr. White loads his two .45 automatics.  He RUNS to the\nend of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.\n\nFIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the\npatrol car.\n\nFreddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr.\nWhite's ambush in shock.\n\nMr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.\n\nMR. BROWN\nMr. Orange?  You're Mr. Orange,\naren't you?\n\nBy the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown\nis dead.\n\nMr. White RUNS up to Freddy.\n\nMR. WHITE\nIs he dead?\n\nFreddy doesn't answer, he can't.\n\nMR. WHITE\nDid he did or not?\n\nFreddy, scared.\n\nFREDDY\nI'm sorry.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat?  Snap out of it!\n\nMr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as\nhe RUNS.\n\nThey EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.\n\nA car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.\n\nMr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car.  He points\nhis jun at her.\n\nMR. WHITE\nGet us outta here!\n\nMr. White climbs into the backseat.\n\nFreddy starts to climb in.\n\nThe Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThe bitch's got a gun!\n\nShe SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.\n\nOn instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the\nface.\n\n\nC.U. ON FREDDY\n\nas he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened\nto him and what he's done.  SLOW MOTION.\n\nMr White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car.  He\nSHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.\n\n\n48     INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY\n\nFreddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is\nCRYING.\n\nWe replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the\ngetaway car.  Except this time, we never leave Freddy.\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nJust hold on buddy boy.\n\nFREDDY\nI'm sorry.  I can't believe she\nkilled me...\n\n\nCUT FROM FREDDY IN THE BACKSEAT TO:\n\n\n49     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY\n\nMr. Pink is behind the wheel, Nice Guy Eddie is in the\npassenger seat going through the satchel with the\ndiamonds.  Mr. White is in the backseat.  The car is\nSPEEDING back to the garage.\n\nEDDIE\n(looking through the\ncase)\nYou know, all things considered,\nthis was pretty successful.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI don't believe you just said\nthat.\n\nEDDIE\nNo, it was messy as hell, but do\nyou realize how much you got away\nwith?  There's over two million\ndollars worth of diamonds here.\n\nMR. PINK\nI love this guy.\n\nEDDIE\nHey, what's done is done.  We can\nall sit around and have a big cry\nabout it or we can deal with the\nsituation at hand.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThe situation as hand isn't that\nfuckin satchel.  You and Joe have\na responsibility to your men.\n\nEDDIE\nHey, it's the best I could do.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThe man is fucking dying.\n\nEDDIE\nAnd I'm telling you, Bonnie'll\ntake care of him.\n\nMR. WHITE\nHe needs a doctor, not a fuckin\nnurse.\n\nEDDIE\nAsk me how many doctors I called.\nYou wanna embarrass yourself, ask\nme how many doctors I called.\n\nMR. WHITE\nObviously not enough.\n\nEDDIE\nFuck you! You gotta little black\nbook, then whip is out.  If not,\nlisten how it is.  I called three\ndoctors and couldn't get through\nto shit.  Now, time being a\nfactor, I called Bonnie.  Sweet\nbroad, helluva broad, and a\nregistered nurse.  Told her a\nbullshit story, upside:  she said\nbring him to her apartment.\n\nMR. WHITE\nIf he dies I'm holding you\npersonally responsible.\n\nEDDIE\nFuck you buddy boy!  Okay, you\nwanna play that way.  I am\npersonally leaving myself\nvulnerable with this Bonnie\nsituation.  I don't think she'll\ncall the cops, but I don't know\nfor sure.  But me being too nice-\na-fuckin-guy was willin to risk\nit.  But no fuckin more.\n(he grabs his\nportable phone)\nI'm callin Bonnie back and tellin\nher to forget it.  You take care\nof your friend, you know so much\nabout it.\n\nMR. PINK\nGoddamnit, will you guys grow up!\n\nEDDIE\nI don't need to grow up, my\nfriend.  I am a grown up.  I'm\nbeing responsible, I'm taking care\nof business.\n\nMR. WHITE\nCut the shit!  I don't think you\ncalled anybody except some cooze\nyou once fucked, who happens to\nwear orthopedic shoes.  And I\ndon't think that's good enough\ncare for a gut-shot man.\n\nEDDIE\nYeah, well I don't give a flying\nfuck what you think!\n\nMR. PINK\n(to Mr. White)\nLook, he's not sayin this bitch is\ngonna operate on him.  She's gonna\ngive him better attention than we\ncan until we can get a doctor.\nNobody's forgotten about doctors.\nJoe'll get one in a snap.  This is\nsomething we're doing in the\nmeantime.  I think both of you are\nactin like a couple of assholes.\n\nEDDIE\nYeah, right.  I arrange a nurse, I\nleave myself wide open, and I'm an\nasshole.\n\n\n50     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\nMEDIUM SHOT on the door.  Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and\nMr. Pink walk through it.  They stop in their tracks.\n\nWe see what they see.  Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground,\nshot full of holes.  The cop slumped over in his chair, a\nbloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding\nhis wound.  Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the\nshot.\n\nEDDIE\nWhat the fuck happened here?\n\nEddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nWhat happened?\n\nMR. ORANGE\n(very weakly)\nBlonde went crazy.  He slashed the\ncop's face, cut off his ear and\nwas gonna burn him alive.\n\nEDDIE\n(yelling)\nWho cares what he was gonna do to\nthis fuckin pig?\n\nEddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop.  The cop and\nthe chair tip over.  Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him\nonce more.\n\nEDDIE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nYou were saying he went crazy?\nSomething like that?  Worse or\nbetter?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nLook, Eddie, he was pullin a burn.\nHe was gonna kill the cop and me.\nAnd when you guys walked through\nthe door, he was gonna blow you to\nhell and make off with the\ndiamonds.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(to Eddie)\nUhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya?\nThat sick piece of shit was a\nstone cold psycho.\n\nMR. ORANGE\n(to Eddie)\nYou could've asked the cop, if you\ndidn't just kill him.  He talked\nabout what he was going to do when\nhe was slicing him up.\n\nEDDIE\nI don't buy it.  It doesn't make\nsense.\n\nMR. WHITE\nIt makes perfect fuckin sense to\nme.  Eddie, you didn't see how he\nacted during the job, we did.\n\nMr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.\n\nMR. PINK\nHe's right about the ear, it's\nhacked off.\n\nEDDIE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nLet me say this out loud, just to\nget it straight in my mind.\nAccording to you, Mr. Blonde was\ngonna kill you.  Then when we came\nback, kill us, grab the diamonds,\nand scram.  That's your story?\nI'm correct about that, right?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nEddie, you can believe me or not\nbelieve me, but it's the truth.  I\nswear on my mother's eternal soul\nthat's what happened.\n\nThe CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.\n\nThere's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange\nhas said.  Finally:\n\nEDDIE\nYou're a fuckin liar.  Now why\ndon't you drop the fuckin fairy\ntale and tell me what really\nhappened?\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nHe told you what really happened.\nYou just can't deal with it.\n\nMR. ORANGE (OS)\nOkay, you're right, I'm lying.\nEven though I'm fuckin dyin I'm\nnot above pullin a fast one.  Get\nrid of Blonde, we share his split\n- no, scratch that, I shot him\n'cause I didn't like his hair\nstyle.  I didn't like his shoes\neither.  If it has just been his\nhair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said,\nlet him live.  But hair and\nfootwear together, he's a goner.\n\nEDDIE\nThe man you killed was just\nreleased from prison.  He got\ncaught at a company warehouse full\nof hot items.  He could've walked\naway.  All he had to do was say my\ndad's name.  But instead he shut\nhis mouth and did his time.  He\ndid four years for us, and he did\n'em like a man.  And we were very\ngrateful.  So, Mr. Orange, you're\ntellin me this very good friend of\nmine, who did four years for my\nfather, who in four years never\nmade a deal, no matter what they\ndangled in front of him, you're\ntelling me that now, that now this\nman is free, and we're making good\non our commitment to him, he's\njust gonna decide, right out of\nthe fuckin blue, to rip us off?\n\nSilence.\n\nEDDIE\nMr. Orange, why don't you tell me\nwhat really happened?\n\nVOICE (OS)\nWhy?  It'll just be more bullshit.\n\nEddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing\nin the warehouse doorway.  He walks into the room.\n\nJOE\n(pointing to Mr.\nOrange)\nThis man set us up.\n\nCAMERA does a 360 around the men.\n\nEDDIE\nDaddy, I'm sorry, I don't know\nwhat's happening.\n\nJOE\nThat's okay, Eddie, I do.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(to Joe)\nWhat the fuck are you talking\nabout?\n\nJOE\n(pointing to Mr.\nOrange)\nThat piece of shit.  Workin with\nthe cops.\n\nMR. WHITE   MR. PINK   EDDIE\nWhat?\n\nJOE\nI said this lump of shit is workin\nwith the LAPD.\n\n\nMR. ORANGE'S POV\n\nLooking up from the floor at everybody.\n\nJoe looks down at Mr. Orange.\n\nJOE\nAren't you?\n\nMR. ORANGE (OS)\nI don't have the slightest fuckin\nidea what you're talkin about.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(very calmly to Joe)\nJoe, I don't know what you think\nyou know, but you're wrong.\n\nJOE\nLike hell I am.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(very calmly)\nJoe, trust me on this, you've made\na mistake.  He's a good kid. I\nunderstand you're hot, you're\nsuper-fuckin pissed.  We're all\nreal emotional.  But you're\nbarking up the wrong tree.  I know\nthis man, and he wouldn't do that.\n\nJOE\nYou don't know jack shit.  I do.\nThis rotten bastard tipped off the\ncops and got Mr. Brown and Mr.\nBlue killed.\n\nMR. PINK\nMr. Blue's dead?\n\nJOE\nDead as Dillinger.\n\nEDDIE\nThe motherfucker killed Vic.\n\nMR. WHITE\nHow do you know all this?\n\nJOE\nHe was the only one I wasn't a\nhundred percent on.  I should have\nmy fucking head examined for goin\nforward when I wasn't a hundred\npercent.  But he seemed like a\ngood kid, and I was impatient and\ngreedy and all the things that\nfuck you up.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(screaming)\nThat's your proof?\n\nJOE\nYou don't need proof when you got\ninstinct.  I ignored it before,\nbut not no more.\n\nHe WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.\n\nMr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.\n\nEddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of\nfirearms.\n\nEddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.\n\nEDDIE\nHave you lost your fucking mind?\nPut your gun down!\n\nMr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this.\n\nMR. WHITE\nJoe, you're making a terrible\nmistake I can't let you make.\n\nEDDIE\nStop pointing your fuckin gun at\ndaddy!\n\nJoe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.\n\nJOE\nDon't worry, Eddie.  Me and Larry\nhave been friends a long time, he\nain't gonna shoot.  We like each\nother too much.\n\nMR. WHITE\nJoe, if you kill that man, you die\nnext.  Repeat, if you kill that\nman, you die next!\n\nWe get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.\n\n\nMEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY\n\nMr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.\n\nJoe pointing down on Mr. Orange.  Not taking his eyes off\nhim.\n\nMr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to\nstart firing any minute.\n\nEddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr.\nWhite.\n\nMr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.\n\nNobody says nothing.\n\n\nFOUR SHOT\n\nof guys ready for violence.  Mr. Pink in the B.G.\n\nMR. PINK\nC'mon, guys, nobody wants this.\nWe're supposed to me fuckin\nprofessionals!\n\nJoe raises his head to Mr. White.\n\nJOE\nLarry, I'm gonna kill him.\n\nMR. WHITE\nGoddamn you, Joe, don't make me do\nthis!\n\nJOE\nLarry, I'm askin you to trust me\non this.\n\nMR. WHITE\nDon't ask me that.\n\nJOE\nI'm not askin, I'm betting.\n\nJoe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.\n\nEDDIE\nDaddy, don't!\n\nJoe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.\n\nMr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face.  Joe brings his\nhands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.\n\nEddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the\nchest.\n\nMr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.\n\nThe two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.\n\nEddie COLLAPSES, dead.\n\nJoe's dead.\n\nMr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest\nheaving.  The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.\n\nMr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees,\nnot moving.\n\nMr. Pink is standing motionless.  Finally he grabs the\nsatchel of diamonds and RUNS out the door.\n\nWe hear outside a CAR START.  Then the SOUND of a BULLHORN\nyells out:\n\nPOLICE FORCE (OS)\nFreeze! Get out of the car and lie\nface down on the ground!\n\nMR. PINK (OS)\nDon't shoot!\n\nWe now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP,\nMEN RUNNING to the warehouse.\n\nWhile all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand\nbut FALLS DOWN.  He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange\nlies.\n\nHe lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and\nstroking his brow.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(with much effort)\nSorry, kid.  Looks like we're\ngonna do a little time.\n\nMr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an\neffort:\n\nMR. ORANGE\nI'm a cop.\n\nMr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's\nbrow.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nI'm sorry, I'm so sorry.\n\nMr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.\nOrange's eyes.\n\nThe CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME C.U. of Mr White.\n\nThe SOUNDS of outside STORM inside.  We don't see\nanything, but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.\n\nPOLICE FORCE (OS)\nFreeze, motherfucker!  Drop your\nfucking gun!\n\nMr White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.\n\nBANG\n\nWe hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.\n\nMr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.1Embed"}]
