whole life building up this ivory tower\nAnd now that I'm in it, I keep wishin' it would fall\nSo I could feel the ground beneath me\nReally taste this air I'm breathin'\nAnd know that I'm

1]\nWhen it rains it pours and opens doors\nAnd floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry\nAnd in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love\nThat have to

everything alright\nAnd when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me\nAnd I can always find my way when you are here\n[Verse 2]\nAnd every word I didn't say that caught up in some busy day\nAnd every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't have before\nAnd every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all up in a kiss\nAnd pick you up in all of this when I sail away\n\n[Chorus]\nWhile I float upon this ocean\nI can feel you like a notion that I hope will never leave\n'Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me\nAnd you make everything alright\nAnd when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me\nAnd I can always find my way\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead\nInstead it feels like it's impossible to fly\nBut with you I can spread my wings\nTo see me over everything\nThat life may send me, when I am hoping\nIt won't pass me by\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me\nThere you are to show me\nWhen I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me\nAnd you make everything alright, when you are

tight used to hooky and chill\nTwat tight plus she cook up a meal\nHad the hook up for real\nMore headaches and stress cause a child involved\nIt's all good cause our sex be my tylenol\nBest baby doll of all\nShit the rest of you childish broads\nGive me the sex then I'm tired of y'all\nSo find a next to provide for y'all\nI got my baby girl, plus she about to drop, my baby girl\nForget about all

be my one and only lady\nCause there's no better love\n\n[Verse 2: Neef]\nComin' up I thought Cupid was stupid\nOnly two love's my family and music\nFallin' through somethin' just couldn't do it\nIt was the beginning of time, and you was like nine\nBut God damn you was fine\nUsed to stay on my mind, when I was out on my grind\nOpened up the bags when I'm choppin' my dimes\nThere in the spinel stood by me for the rentals\nPopped up mad shit with me and got me rentals\nSick with the plastic, what can I say\nBitches hate around the way, I had a lady\nGossip and watchin' him, runnin' back\nMoved up North, kinda fell off track\nStill my peoples though, love when I see you though\nOnce a while might call just to chill might ball\nForever my dog, even when I downfall\nFirst in line whenever chick is involved, but\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Neef + (Young Chris)]\nWe the youngest in charge, so leave them other scrugs\nWe give you better love the same time is tough\n(Baby I feel the same as Neef do)\n(Spit the game as he do)\n(If you could take two, ain't no need to bring your people)\nLingerie see-through\n(She got it goin' on)\nOh that's +Can't stop, Won't stop+\n(We got 'em goin' home)\nWe got 'em all alone\n(Just us nobody's wrong)\nI'm a hit it you can hit it\nI pull out on them all\n\n[Verse 4: Rell]\nEver since the day I saw your face\nMy mind told me you were the one that was down for me\nAnd baby when I get laced, I'm gonna do what you want I'll be there (truly)\nSo don't you let a thing turn you away from the love that you need (my

one\n\nDon't you know that I've waited for you\nYou are everything I've wanted all my life\nNever thought I would find what I need\nTill you came along my dreams seemed so far away\n[Chorus]\nI could be with another girl\nAnd I can take a trip all around the world\nBut why would I go anywhere when I've got you\nI could spend my money on fancy clothes\nMeet a thousand women doing videos and shows\nBut baby I'm so glad that I got you\n\n[Verse 2]\nMaybe I just got lucky\nBecause a chance like this don't come along every day\nAnd can we hold on to what we've got\nIf I ever lost you girl, my whole life would change\n\nYou should know that your life gives me strength\nAnd without you I don't know where I would be\nIt's because of your shoulder I'm at ease\nNo matter where I am I'm not alone. eh\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll that I have\nIs nothing when it compares to you\nAnd I can't believe\nHoe your love makes me feel\nI'm glad that I've got you\nAnd girl you've got me too\nSee

Reed and Jones have been recording together for WJ3 since 1996. Their first WJ3 release was Volume 1 \u2026 Straight Swingin\u2019, followed by Volume 2 \u2026Don\u2019t Knock the Swing, Volume 3, The Next Phase, and most recently Willie Jones III Sextet Plays the Max Roach Songbook. With the exception of the Max Roach Songbook , all of these recordings feature compositions authored by Reed.\n\n46. Reed composed \u201cThe Thorn\u201d in 2009 for WJ3 release The Next Phase. \u201cThe Thorn\u201d is a hard swinging track featuring an extremely distinctive and catchy hook that is the refrain of the song. The recording is infectiously rhythmic with clever melodic triplets throughout the hook played expertly by a tight rhythm section and commanding horns.\n\n47. Recording sessions took place at Systems Two Studios in Brooklyn, New York on October 15 and December 17, 2009. The band consisted of Reed on piano, Jones on drums, Dezron Douglas on bass, Warren Wolf on vibes, Greg Tardy on tenor saxophone, and Steve Davis on trombone.\n\n48.The Next Phase was released on July 20, 2010, featuring Reed\u2019s \u201cThe Thorn as the opening track. Copies of the recording were available for purchase through iTunes, EMusic, Amazon, and CDBaby.\n\n49.The Next Phase was available for listening on various streaming services including Spotify, Pandora, and Rhapsody.Defendants\u2019 Infringement of \u201cThe Thorn\u201d50. Neither Reed nor Jones granted permission to any of the Defendants to use \u201cThe Thorn\u201d in any manner whatsoever. Defendants\u2019 use of \u201cThe Thorn\u201d was completely unauthorized and without the knowledge or consent of owners Reed and Jones.\n\n51. Upon information and belief, after obtaining copies of and/or listening to \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, one or all of the Defendants created a sound recording titled \u201cRigamortus\u201d, which was a track on Lamar\u2019s\nSection.80 (TopDawg).\n\n52. \u201cRigamortus\u201d is a hip-hip recording consisting entirely of the refrain from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d sound recording with lyrics added and performed by Lamar.\n\n53. \u201cThe Thorn\u201d is not merely a part of \u201cRigamortus\u201d or even the heart of \u201cRigamortus\u201d; it is \u201cRigamortus\u201d. The distinctive and catchy refrain from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d sound recording, sped up a bit, repeats as a continuous loop throughout the entire \u201cRigamortus\u201d song while Lamar raps over it. The clever melodic triplets, infectious rhythm, and commanding horns from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d are copied to \u201cRigamortus\u201d directly from Jones\u2019 sound recording. Defendants did not play any instruments or contribute any original musical performance to the \u201cRigamortus\u201d sound recording. The instrumental element of \u201cRigamortus\u201d and the composition that it embodies are owned and authored entirely by Jones and Reed respectively.\n\n54. The lyrics to \u201cRigamortus\u201d and the performance thereof are the only elements of \u201cRigamortus\u201d not copied directly from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d.\n\n55. Despite having contributed no original music to \u201cRigamortus\u201d, Lamar and Brown registered their claim of copyright in the composition \u201cRigamortus\u201d with the Copyright Office as reflected by Registration No. PA0001856022. Their authorship is described as music and lyrics. Records on file with ASCAP and the HFA show Lamar, Brown, and Spears as authors, listing them and their associated publishers along with TopDawg Entertainment as copyright claimants entitled to royalties.\n\n56. Upon information and belief, after obtaining copies of and/or listening to \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, one or all of the Defendants created a sound recording titled \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d featuring famous rapper, Busta Rhymes (TopDawg).\n\n57. \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d is nearly identical to \u201cRigamortus\u201d, containing the same musical elements from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d as \u201cRigamortus\u201d, only with additional lyrics performed and  presumably authored by Busta Rhymes.\n\n58. \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d was released as a single by TopDawg Entertainment.\n\n59. ASCAP records for \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d list only Brown as sole author, despite that he contributed no original musical authorship to the work, and the Remix is a mere variation of \u201cRigamortus\u201d.\n\n60. Upon information and belief, after obtaining copies of and/or listening to \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, one or all of the Defendants created a sound recording titled \u201cRigamortus (Full Instrumental)\u201d (TopDawg).\n\n61. \u201cRigamortus (Full Instrumental)\u201d was released on Ichiban: Sound in 3D by Defendant, Brown (TopDawg).\n\n62. \u201cRigamortus (Full Instrumental)\u201d does not feature lyrics or vocal performances and consists only of the repeating loop that was taken from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d with minor sonic embellishments and studio sound effects added. Authorship in the sound recording and the underlying musical composition belong entirely to Reed and Jones.Striking Similarity of the Works61. The TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs all consist of the repeating loop of the distinctive and catchy refrain from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d sound recording.\n\n62. \u201cThe Thorn\u201d and the TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs feature clever melodic triplets, infectious rhythm, and commanding horns.\n\n63. The TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs\u2019 striking similarity to \u201cThe Thorn\u201d is obvious, even to non-musicians. Jones and Reed became aware of the infringing \u201cRigamortus\u201d through non-musicians who brought the Lamar recording to their attention. After performing \u201cThe Thorn\u201d live at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola in New York, Reed was approached by two separate members of the audience who exclaimed that Lamar sampled the song. A high school friend of Jones\u2019 saw Lamar\u2019s \u201cRigamortus\u201d video, immediately recognized \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, and contacted Jones. The Wikipedia page for Section.80 states: \u201c \u2018Rigamortus\u2019 contains a sample of \u2018The Thorn\u2019 as  performed by Willie Jones III\u201d, and the website found at www.whosampled.com (image below) states that music from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d appears throughout \u201cRigamortus\u201d, even though Lamar\u2019s album does not list \u201cThe Thorn\u201d or its authors among the album credits.64. Pianist Kris Bowers covered \u201cRigamortus\u201d, spelling it \u201cRigamortis\u201d and stating that the Lamar recording contains music from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, written by Reed and recorded on Jones\u2019 The Next Phase.\n\n65. All versions of \u201cRigamortus\u201d and \u201cRigamortis\u201d, starting with the TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs and including covers, remakes, remixes, and other variations thereof are infringing derivative works adapted from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d.Access to Reed/Jones\u2019 \u201cThe Thorn\u201d66. \u201cThe Thorn\u201d appeared on The Next Phase, which was released to the worldwide general public for purchase on July 20, 2010. Online retailers iTunes, Amazon, and CDBaby carried the recording for anyone to purchase.\n\n67. \u201cThe Thorn\u201d was available for listening via streaming audio on the Internet from Spotify, Rhapsody, Pandora, and others on the July 20, 2010 release date.\n\n68. Upon information and belief, one or all of the Defendants obtained a copy of \u201cThe Thorn\u201d and copied it in order to make the TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs in 2011.\n\n69. Neither Reed nor Jones nor their affiliated companies gave permission to any of the Defendants to copy, use, or otherwise exploit any of their music in any form whatsoever. Defendants appropriated \u201cThe Thorn\u201d without the knowledge or consent of the rightful owners of the song and sound recording. Defendants did so willfully; fully aware that the music they appropriated was not theirs and that they did not have permission to use it.\n\n69. Defendants did not attribute any of the musical element of the TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs to Reed or Jones. No album credit or other acknowledgement was afforded Reed and Jones for \u201cThe Thorn\u201d.\n\n69. Brown has made it of record that he is an avid listener of jazz and relative of trumpet legend Clifford Brown.\n\n70. On September 7, 2011, Brown contacted Reed via facebook and inquired: \u201cI need to ask you a question about sampling ..Like if I were to sample your work for a hip hop record.. What would your feelings be about that?\u201d\n\n71. Unaware that \u201cThe Thorn\u201d had already been misappropriated by Brown, Reed replied by suggesting that they talk in more detail in the future. Reed did not consent to the use of any of his music in any part of the exchange with Brown.\n\n71. In a video posted to his own YouTube channel on September 17, 2011, producer Brown demonstrates exactly how he \u201ccreated\u201d \u201cRigamortus\u201d. The caption on the YouTube page lists the following description for the video: \u201cWillie B plays the original sample of \u2018Rigamortus\u2019 and shows the session in fruityloops. #HiiiPoWer.\u201d The video opens with Brown addressing viewers and then shifts to his computer from which he plays \u201cThe Thorn\u201d and the monitor reads: \u201cWillie Jones III The Thorn\u201d. The entire video is 2:31 in length and no instruments are used. Only the computer and the sound recording of \u201cThe Thorn\u201d are used to create \u201cRigamortus\u201d in less than three minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n72. In an interview posted on istandardproducers.com, Brown stated that the \u201cRigamortus\u201d instrumental track was something he made in his mother\u2019s back room with his only contribution being production. He went on to say that the track was really for a rap song that he wrote titled \u201cThe Thorn\u201d.Defendants\u2019 Exploitation of \u201cRigamortus\u201d and Other Infringing Derivative Works and Benefits Derived Therefrom73. \u201cRigamortus\u201d was released for worldwide purchase via the Internet as part of Lamar\u2019s acclaimed\nSection.80 (TopDawg).\n\n74. At the time of filing this Complaint, Plaintiffs are aware of the following versions of the infringing \u201cRigamortus\u201d: \u201cRigamortus\u201d, Kendrick Lamar:Section.80; \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d, Kendrick Lamar featuring Busta Rhymes; \u201cRigamortus (Full Instrumental)\u201d, Willie B:Ichiban: Sound in 3D; \u201cRigamortis Cover\u201d, Kris Bowers; \u201cRigamortis\u201d, CGP All Stars: All the  Kings Men; \u201cRigamortis (Instrumental)\u201d, Syndicate Sound Labs: Kendrick\u2019s Instrumentals, Vol. 1; \u201cRigamortis\u201d, Redd:Potential; and \u201cNational Rigamortis (Radiohead x Kendrick Lamar)\u201d, the B.E.A.T.:undercover EP.\n\n75. All songs listed in the preceding paragraph are being sold, performed, licensed, and otherwise exploited for money by the Defendants.\n\n76. The numerous remakes, remixes, and excessive exploitation of \u201cRigamortus\u201d are a testament to the immense popularity of the musical portion of the song. However, they have saturated the airwaves and diminished the market for licensing \u201cThe Thorn\u201d for use by other  producers.\n\n77. Pharrell Williams praised Lamar as one of the next great hip hop artists, citing Rigamortis as a favorite and saying: \u201cI LOVE -- that jazz sh*t\u201d. (The image below is the moment when Williams expressed his love of the jazz.) Since then, Lamar has collaborated with Williams on music featured in the soundtrack to the film The Amazing Spider Man 2.78. Lady Gaga also is a known fan of Lamar\u2019s, tweeting the hashtag #Rigamortis on July 4, 2011 before attending his performance at Pitchfork music festival in Chicago.\n\n79. In an interview posted on hiphopdx.com, Brown states that \u201cRigamortus\u201d opened doors for him and \u201ccatapulted\u201d his career.\n\n80. As the listed copyright claimants to \u201cRigamortus\u201d, Defendants collect and/or are  believed to be entitled to collect royalties and licensing revenue from all exploitation of \u201cRigamortus\u201d including but not limited to remakes, remixes, videos, and streaming.\n\n81. Terrence \u201cPunch\u201d Henderson, co-president of TopDawg Entertainment told Billboard Magazine in an interview that appeared in the March 8, 2014 issue that Section.80 sold more than 130,000 copies.\n\n82. Upon information and belief, each and all of the Defendants infringed \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, and they knew, or should have known, of the infringing acts of each of the other Defendants, and they materially contributed to the infringement alleged herein.\n\n81. As a result of their wrongful conduct, Defendants are liable to Reed, Jones, Soldier\u2019s Hymn, and WJ3 for copyright infringement pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501, false designation of origin pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125, misappropriation pursuant to 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.30, unjust enrichment, and diminution of value.\n\n82. Reed and Jones have suffered, and will continue to suffer, substantial losses as a result of Defendants\u2019 conduct complained of herein.\n\n83. Reed, Jones, Soldier\u2019s Hymn, and WJ3 are entitled to recover damages, which include their losses and any and all profits Defendants have made as a result of their wrongful conduct pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504.\n\n84.

Reed and his Soldier\u2019s Hymn are the sole copyright owner and publisher of the composition \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, embodied in the sound recording of the same name, which Defendants willfully infringed.\n\n88. Defendants are directly liable for copyright infringement because, after obtaining access to \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, they copied the copyrighted work to create the TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs: \u201cRigamortus\u201d, \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d and \u201cRigamortus (Full Instrumental)\u201d, all infringing derivative works.\n\n89.

As a direct and proximate result of the wrongful conduct of Defendants, Reed/Soldier\u2019s Hymn and Jones/WJ3 have suffered and continue to suffer substantial money damages at an amount to be proven at trial.SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF Contributory Copyright Infringement93. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations set forth in  paragraphs 1-92 inclusive, as though fully set forth herein. 94.

Defendants obtained Plaintiffs\u2019 musical performance of \u201cThe Thorn\u201d and the composition embodied therein, exploited these properties in numerous ways for pecuniary gain and career advancement.

Artists and producers far more successful than the Defendants (such as \u201cHappy\u201d  phenom, Pharrell Williams and pop queen Lady Gaga) have openly expressed their love of \u201cThe Thorn\u201d through their praise of the \u201cRigamortus\u201d instrumental. Plaintiffs\u2019 opportunity to license \u201cThe Thorn\u201d for use by artists and/or producers on that level has been eliminated by Defendants\u2019 excessive exploitation of the song.\n\nWHEREFORE, Reed/Soldier\u2019s Hymn and Jones/WJ3 pray as set forth above and for the following relief:\n\n(i) Ordering Defendants to immediately cease and desist all exploitation of all versions of \u201cRigamortus\u201d/\u201dRigamortis\u201d and their derivatives and remakes and associated audiovisual works;\n\n(ii) Ordering the impoundment and destruction of all infringing articles;\n\n(iii) Ordering Defendants to transfer to Plaintiffs all copyrights in \u201cRigamortus\u201d, \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d, and \u201cRigamortus (Full Instrumental)\u201d, including but not limited to copyright in the sound recordings and underlying compositions in all versions of the songs;\n\n(iv) Ordering Defendants to amend all U.S. Copyright Registrations, ASCAP Registrations and HFA Registrations so that all Defendants are removed and replaced by Plaintiffs as authors and copyright claimants;\n\n(v) Ordering Defendants, jointly and severally, to pay Plaintiffs damages they have sustained and will sustain, and any income, gains, profits, and advantages obtained by Defendants as a result of their wrongful acts alleged hereinabove, in an amount according to  proof but not less than $1,000,000.00;\n\n(vi) Full disgorgement of Defendants\u2019 profits from the infringement;\n\n(vii) Ordering Defendants to pay to Plaintiffs all royalties earned now and in the future from all versions of \u201cRigamortus\u201d/\u201dRigamortis\u201d without deductions for any expenses or disbursements such as recording costs;\n\n(viii) Ordering Defendants, jointly and severally, to pay Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses, and costs incurred in connection with this action, in an amount which cannot yet be\n\n(ix) Ordering Defendants, jointly and severally, to pay to Plaintiffs pre- and post- judgment interest;\n\n(x) Ordering Defendants, jointly and severally, to acknowledge Plaintiffs as authors and creators of the \u201cRigamortus\u201d sound recordings and underlying compositions, and all derivative works which have been released or authorized and will be released or authorized, indirectly or directly, by Defendants;\n\n(xi) Ordering Defendants publicly to acknowledge the infringement and apologize to Reed, Jones, and the other musicians who made possible their success;\n\n(xii) For such further relief and remedies the Court may deem just and proper.JURY TRIAL DEMANDEDPlaintiffs hereby request a trial by jury on each claim for relief alleged in the Complaint.\n\nDated: July 2, 2014\n\nERIC S.

niggas\nCuttin' school, gettin' high with the hottest bitches\nLivin' life so free, that we ain't fearin' the\nIlls of the world and the heat of drug dealin'\nYou and I then made a killin', and stuck together\nIn this land of forbidden treasure\nLove is the only evil seed that could sever a tie this close\nNot the love between us, but your love for the dough\nYou went O.T., started makin' M-O-N-E, why\nAll my good niggas gotta die?\nBut shit could last forever, I wish death was pleasure\n'Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together\n\n[Chorus: Lil' Mo]\nWhen I cry, you cry, we cry

you\nScanning the stations, every song they're playin'\nIs like a soundtrack, to the love we had\nI should be over you by now, but every time I turn around...\n\nIt's always somethin' every day remindin' me\nEverywhere I go, there's a memory\nReady and awaitin' to catch me off guard\nThere's no way to prepare my heart\nWhat I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do\nIf only I could just stop missin' you\nI'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing\nBut it's always something\nLunch time, a new place\nWaitress says her name\nWhy does it have to be, Emily\nCorner store, stop in\nSomeone ask, \"How ya been?\"\nI say I wouldn't know\nI really gotta go\nWish I could forget you, but I don't know how\nCause every time I turn around...\n\nIt's always somethin' every day remindin' me\nEverywhere I go, there's a memory\nReady and awaitin' to catch me off guard\nThere's no way to prepare my heart\nWhat I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do\nIf only I could just stop

just never knew how true those words would be\nJust an old love song\nJust a mention of your name\nMy heart breaks in two again\nI guess some things never change\n[Verse 3]\nMaybe someday someone else will set me free\nUntil then I'll live with your loves legacy\nAnd I'll keep holding on\nHoping you'll come back someday\nYou can rest assured\nBaby some things never change\nGirl I'm still in love

fooled\nBecause she was an angel in disguise\nHurt and pain could never come from her\nSo you left me only to find that\nHurt and pain involves her\nBut now you see your mistakes\nAnd now you see your angel was a fake\nBut my love was never misplaced\nSee, baby, my love is true\nAnd most importantly, still, I love you\n(Still, I love you)\n[Chorus]\nAn angel in disguise she was\nBut somehow you fell for her\nAnd though she broke your heart that day\nAnd left you in the rain\nBut still, I love you\nAn angel in disguise she was\nBut somehow you fell for her\nAnd though she broke your heart that day\nAnd left you in the rain\nBut still, I love you\n\n[Verse 1]\nI found it quite strange\nThe way you said her name\nAnd when you look in her eyes\nI see the lust you can't deny\nIt's more to this than what you said\n'Cause in your sleep, you called her name\nYou say she's just a friend\nI knew right then 'cause the rain began, oh-oh\n\n[Chorus]\nAn angel in disguise she was (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nBut somehow you fell for her (You fell for her)\nAnd though she broke your heart that day (She broke your heart)\nAnd left you in the rain (Yeah)\nBut still, I love you (Oh, I love you, baby)\nAn angel in disguise she was (Oh, I'm with you, baby)\nBut somehow you fell for her (I'm ready for you, baby)\nAnd though she broke your heart that day (And left you in the rain)\nAnd left you in the rain (Yeah)\nBut still, I love you\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nShe seemed so familiar the day that I met her\nWho was she foolin'?\nI had a clue of what she was doin'\nThoughts of suspicion brought to my attention\nI fell in her game, and I'm so lost\nPlease stop the rain, oh-ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nAn angel in disguise she was (Oh, you hurt me, babe)\nBut somehow you fell for her (Yeah, but I'm still here)\nAnd though she broke your heart that day (Still lovin' you)\nAnd left you in the rain\nBut still, I love you (Oh, I might be crazy, babe)\nAn angel in disguise she was (But I love you, babe)\nBut somehow you fell for her (Somehow you fell)\nAnd though she broke your heart that day (She left you in the rain)\nAnd left you in the rain\nBut still, I love you\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd when my music stops\nAnd when my tears dry\nAnd when the rain ends\nMy heart will beat again\nAnd when my music stops\nAnd when my tears dry\nAnd when the rain ends\nMy heart will beat again (Ooh baby, oh,

man\nHearts caught fire and love ran wild\nShe cried the day she called to say she was having his child\nWith so much riding on the choice at hand\nThe spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man\nThere's a constant contradiction, what feels good and what feels right\nBut you live with decisions that you make in your life\nAnd what steers your direction is hard to understand\nThe spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man\nNow he drives a diesel out of Dallas, hauling cars out to the coast\nIt ain't the dream that he remembered, just a few short years ago\nBut tonight at a truck stop, while drinking a cup\nThe waitress grins and winks at him and says, \"My shift's almost up\"\nWith so much riding on the choice at hand\nThe spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man\nWith so much riding on the choice at

being in the same room as you and your girlfriend\nThe fact that she don't know\nThat really turns me on\nShe'll never guess in a million years\nThat we've got this thing going on\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're my little secret\nAnd that's how we should keep it\nIt's on everybody's mind, about you and I\nThey think so, but they don't really know\nOr wanna know that\nYou're my little secret\nAnd that's how we should keep it\nWe should never let 'em know\nNever let it show\nIf you know, like I know\nWe should never let it go\n\n[Verse 2: Tiny]\nIf anybody knew that it was you and your house\nThat I was

heaven\nHaving great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory\nAnd he cried mightily with a strong voice saying\n\"Babylon the great has fallen\nHas fallen and has become the habitation of devils\nAnd the home to every foul spirit\nAnd a cage of very unclean, and hateful men\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah, what you see is what you get now\nXzibit never wait around for no kickdown, got my own shit loud\nShot heard around the world\nUplift, bench press, arm curl, keep the structure of the temple\nTo make things simple, my existence is a ripple through time\nOnly concerned with what is mine, divine\nNever monkeyshine, walkin down a very thin line\nHoldin heat, runnin crazy in the streets, yeah (What's up?)\nPlus the company I keep put in overtime while you oversleep\nDon't wanna see none of this evil I speak\nAround the atlas, cum laude magna, the super actress\nYou all get clothe-lined and pinned to the mattress\nAll day, every day, every which way\nWho said you can't have your cake and eat it too (Fuck you!)\nThis is hard time on Planet Earth, for what it's worth\nXzibit stay in rotation without rehabilitation like this\n[Bridge]\nPlayers, pimps, hoes, hustlers\nWillies, thugs, ballers, busters\nGangstas, macks, everyday, all day\nShot callers, even high rollers keep it moving\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat you see is what you get now\nThe kinda style make the whole world go wild\nBless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone\nAnd no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou got more than you bargained for; hit the floor\nI pull a fast one to let you know today could be your last one black\nTake your breath like an asthma attack\nJust a slave like Flavor Flav, \"You're blind to the facts\"\nMr. X to the Z, tha Liks and King Tee\nGuaranteed to bring the house down naturally\nNiggas knowin No Limits like Master P\nMakin you motherfuckin bastards see (What?)\nA whole different breed of MC; realize it's you against me\nCatch a three-hundred and sixty degree\nRoundhouse to the mouth right\nAnd like the sun, make the hot shit shine bright\nI feelin like my whole life is a green light never turn red\nCause I strike like a rattlesnake, lock like a dread\nNiggas wanna bump heads, but they better off dead\nCame crashin through the door like the Feds, bring it\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhat you see is what you get now\nThe kinda style make the whole world go wild\nBless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone\nAnd no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe year everybody start to rush\nSwingin through is your friendly neighborhood lush\nI crack your bottle then watch how Xzibit bust\nI regulate like a killer with a nickel plate, I set it straight\nStart to shakin you down, breakin new ground, construction work\nHeavy artillery, put your dick in the dirt\nStay alert, the game is rough so you might get hurt\nSlug burnt through your jacket through your sweater, through your shirt\nGet cut from the belly up (What?)\nI break the chain, fast lane, suck my sugar cane\nI'm tryin to spark a nigga brain while you entertain trivial things\nMaterial things, protected by the underground kings\nWho rule the land with an iron fist\nThe Men in Black, if we flash can't remember shit (Sorry)\nYou cross me, I'll make you pay like the government, I wanna kill Sam\nCause my package came short twelve grams, get the picture?\n\n[Bridge]\nPlayers, pimps, hoes, hustlers\nWillies, thugs, ballers, busters\nGangstas, macks, everyday, all day\nShot callers, even high rollers keep it moving\n[Chorus]\nWhat you see is what you get now\nThe kinda style make the whole world go wild\nBless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone\nAnd no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/6998163", "artist_names": "Genius", "full_title": "November 2022 Singles Release

2]\nShe's convinced she could hold back a glacier\n(Between cotton balls and xylophones)\nBut she couldn't keep baby alive\n(I'm getting old)\nDoubting if there's a woman in there somewhere\nHere, here, here\n[Chorus]\nYou say you don't want it, again and again\nBut you don't, don't really mean it\nYou say you don't want it, the circus we're in\nBut you don't, don't really mean it\nYou don't, don't really mean it\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf the divine master's plan is perfection\n(Swing low)\nMaybe next I'll give Judas a try\n(Swing low, sweet chariot)\nTrusting my soul to the ice cream assassin\nHere, here, here\n\n[Chorus]\nYou say you don't want it, again and again\nBut you don't, don't really mean it\nYou say you don't want it, the circus we're in\nBut you don't, don't really

Philly\nFake MC's getting gassed like they eatin chili\nOnly way they seem to rap is if they got a Philly\nMaybe I'm Nicole Brown, cause you really kill me\nGot away with hittin me, but you ain't O.J\nI'm bout to shake up the world like Cassius Clay\nWhen I bumble watch your back cause I sting like bee\nThis ain't the Wild Wild West and you ain't Kool Moe Dee\nWatch a movie now you think that you really Joe Pesci\nYou don't want beef with me, like a diaper I'm messy\n[Timbaland]\nI'm that laid back brother they call Timbaland\nI drive a 850 sometimes a 3-2 Mazda van\nYou can catch me standin in my b-boy stance\nOr catch me at home watching 'Who's the Man'?\nThey call Robert, cause I pack much heat\nOr call me now, because they dig the way I speaks\nI'm like a genie, because I've been trapped in a bottle\nI've got more stunts, than that nigga Desperado\nCome follow, a mad brother with ?*unintelligible*?\nTomorrow, you be sayin, when can we meet? Uhh uhh\nMy offices hours are nine to five\nAin't that right Maganoo, Maganoo?

talked about it amongst they friends\nComing around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend\nLike you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes, even Bo knew that you got poked\nLike acupuncture patients\nWhile our nation is a boat, straight sinking\nI hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un\nThey fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to\nI\u2019m willing to go the extra kilometer\nJust to see my se\u00f1orita get her pillow\nOn the side of my bed where no girl ever stay\nHouse and doctor was the games we used to play\nBut now it\u2019s real Jazzy Belle\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nSee what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw\nHaving the very best of life: lobster, steak and Perignon\nSmoking an ounce of weed\nAnd every single day was personal FreakNik\nTricking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it\nBut your conception, deception, looking into your eyes\nI see your weapon and it\u2019s depressing\nThey're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits\nKeeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers\nHoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds\nSteadily calling me Antwan 'cause you thinking that you my lady\nBitch, don\u2019t play me 'cause you\u2019re janky\nI wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky\nSo thank thee, for running that Southernplayalistic game\nYou was the only one to blame, a nigga don\u2019t even know yo name\nIt\u2019s a shame, you cracking 'em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up\nI\u2019m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don\u2019t get me\nSee, I gotta be feeding my daughter\nTeach her to be that Natural Woman\n'Cause you\u2019ll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be Dumb\nAnd Dumber, yeah, you know what I\u2019m saying\n\n[Verse 3: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nSee me and ol' girl in the black-on-black 'Lac Northstar\nWindows are tinted so that no one knows who us are\nTalk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra\nStraps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa\nIn this dog-eat-dog world\nKitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl\nUp with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits\nI want to hurl, 'cause most of the girls\nThat we was liking in high school, now they dyking\nYou might also like[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nHaving no mercy for the disrespectful ones, some\nBe hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb\nDeaf and fine, they be

met the whole scene was set\nBackstage rockin' black shades\nTold you not to be afraid\nWe touched, then your smile turned to a blush\nI had to get to know your name\nThen I got your number\nSeventeen and under\nMaybe just a little younger\nHad to get to know cause there's things I got to show you\nForget them other brothers\nThey know lines that they told you\nNow you're acting all shy\nHmm, I wonder why\nEverytime I look at you\nYou turn and drop your eye\n\nWe faced\nBegan to lace you up with lines\nFragrance by Ann Klein had me losing my mind\nWith your zodiac sign\nMy perfect match in fact\nI'm compatable with anything from Mio to Ash\nNow it's all about us cause we're hooked like drugs\nI'm on my way to being a thug\nShow me love\n\n[Chorus]\nBoy, all I see is you and me\nAnd all I do is think of you\nGive me the chance to know your name\nI'll never turn and walk away\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nI can't get you out of my mind\nI'd be lying\nIf I said I wasn't hooked after just one look\nYeah, see you at the mall with your mom looking all flashy\nPoppin' out of a taxi\nMet eyes when you passed me\nBeen inside of my head all day\n\nWhat can I say?\nAll I can do is reminicse like Mary J\nI want to get with you\nSo come and get with me\nWe'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nAnd all that good stuff\nCalling you bluff, now look at us\nJust met and already talking 'bout trust\nAll the things we did\nHow we planned to live\nHow you got rid of that kid who use to call you crib\n\nShut it down\nNow look what you found state of dawn\nYou da bomb\nPlus you got props from my mom\nNow it's all about us cause we're hooked like drugs\nI'm on my way to being a thug\nShow me love\nI can't get you out of my mind\nThink about you all of the time\nGot to get to know you, babe\nBaby, oh.....\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm glad I made my move\nI'm glad I stepped to you\nEnough respect that my whole crew excepted you\nEven my ex called you\n\nShe wasn't insecure\nFeeling she got a little hurt\nBut was being mature\nGave her blessing\nShe learned a valuable lesson\nNow she's my best friend\nDon't even stress\n\n'Cause all I see is you and me\nLike Latifah\nYou're queen\nLet's bring some unity\n\nAin't no reason to fight\nYou know we're always keeping it tight\nWhether walking or holding hands or sharing seats on the bike\nAlways on my mind with your Gucci design\nFeel free to drop a line\nYeah, that would suit me fine\n\nIt's all about you, boo\nAnd all the things you do\nMaking dreams come true\nBuying rings for two\nNow it's all about us cause we're hooked like drugs\nI'm on my way to being a thug\nShow me love\n\n[Chorus]\nBoy, all I see is you and me\nAnd all I do is think of you\nGive me the chance to know your name\nI'll never turn and walk away\n\nBoy. all I need is you and me\nAnd all I do is think of you\nGive me the chance to know your name\nI'll never turn and walk away1Embed"}]
