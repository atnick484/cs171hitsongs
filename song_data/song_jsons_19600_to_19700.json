He never really talks much\nNever concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck\nHumbled through opportunities given despite the fact\nThat many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps\nPut it together himself, now the picture connects\nNever asking for someone's help (Help), or to get some respect ('Spect)\nHe's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach\nAnd now it all unfolds to the skill of an artist\n\n[Verse 3: Ryu]\nThis is twenty percent skill (Uh), eighty percent beer\nBe a hundred percent clear, 'cause Ryu is ill (Next)\nWho would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames\nThen I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method \"Name of the Game\" (Uh-huh)\nCame back, dropped \"Megadef,\" took 'em to church\nI like \"Bleach\", man, Ryu had the stupidest verse (Ha-ha)\nThis dude is the truth, now, everybody giving him guest spots\nHis stock's through the roof, I heard he fucking with S.

down\nWhen I think about me and you\nSometimes I get a little loud\nBaby, I know we did it all night long\nAnd I didn't want to burn you out\n'Cause you know how much I like to do it\nIn the morning it's another round\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't know if you have other things to do, no no no\nSo maybe I'll just lay around\nPlay by myself\nWhile touching on my favorite fruit\nYou might also

Simpson, Nick Lachey]\nWhere you are (Where you are)\nWhere you and I will breathe together\nOnce again (Once again)\nWe'll be dancing in the moonlight\nJust like we used to do\nAnd you'll be smiling

from afar\nAnd anytime I feel alone\nI close my eyes and dream of where you are\n\n[Chorus: Nick Lachey, Jessica Simpson]\nWhere you are (Where you are)\nWhere you and I will breathe together (And we will breathe together, baby)\nOnce again (Oh)\nWe'll be dancing in the moonlight (We'll be dancing in the moonlight)\nJust like we used to do\nAnd you'll be smiling back at me (And you'll be smiling

2]\nDear Jonathan, I liked you too much\nI used to be attracted to boys who would lie to me\nAnd think solely about themselves\nAnd you were plenty self-destructive for my taste at the time\nI used to say the more tragic, the better\nThe truth is whenever I think of the early 90's\nYour face comes up with a vengeance\nLike it was yesterday\n[Verse 3]\nDear Terrance, I love you muchly\nYou've been nothing but open hearted\nAnd emotionally available and supportive\nAnd nurturing and consummately there for me\nI kept drawing you in\nAnd pushing you away\nI remember how beautiful it was to\nFall asleep on your couch and cry in front of you for the first time\nYou were the best platform from which to jump beyond myself\nWhat was wrong with me?\n\n[Verse 4]\nDear Marcus, you rocked my world\nYou had a charismatic way about you with the women\nAnd you got me seriously thinking about spirituality\nAnd you wouldn't let me get away with kicking my own ass\nBut I could never really feel relaxed and looked out for around you though\nAnd that stopped us from going any further than we did\nAnd it's kind of too bad because we could've had much more fun\n\n[Verse 5]\nDear Lou, we learned so much\nI realize we won't be able to talk for some time\nAnd I understand that as I do you\nThe long distance thing was the hardest and we did as well as we could\nWe were together during a very

that broke the heart\nOf the one the only one that really loves her\n\nWith one stoke of the pen\nShe wrote off all my dreams\nErasing all those plans we made together\nThere's no one that I can

without a timezone switch\nAnd start, flashing off top like a 5-0's whip\nYou think a cyclone hit, don't cry though bitch\n'Cause that's a high tone pitch no strike zone fits\nEvery shot that I throw splits ya' microchips\nIf Ben' getting outta pocket like the iPhone 6\nThis kid's got a drinking problem, he ain't got a bright future\nAt the bar last night till last call, a blind loser\nHe said, \"You want a wine cooler?\"\nNah I'm not a high schooler\nThree shots later he's walking like Walter White Jr\nSooner or later I had to prove you a bitch Bender\nI'm here to toss money around like a big spender\nLimbs getting dismembered, head spinning, hit record, quick-tempered\nThis shot won the west like a Winchester\nI been tested over time, and I know that I could beat him\nDouble wide tomb, don't close the mausoleum\nI'ma show this clown the meaning of how locals start the season\nLeave his head half empty, that's the Oakland Coliseum\nYou gonna die, I bet if you challenge me

last five years\nWe both had that King of the Dot chain on and lost that shit\nThe difference is, I threw that match and walked like an arsonist\nDon't twist it up, I'm tryna catch a pay check\nShit I

common with Philip Seymour Hoffman\nHopefully, 'cause he died\nCaution tape the crime scene and let the Lord be with him\nIf you think he won a round, it doesn't count, like Norbes' opinion\nIn your condition man you need to fucking stop it\nIf this painter make a stand you'll see the ease I'll brush him off with\nNow, you fucking lost it but I won't say how\nGloves off, you musta quit, that's the OJ trial\nShit we could go eight rounds, I'll crush you till they shut this whole place down\nThen have it opened back up like a cold case file\nNow, you thought you were the First Airborne, you a

they chose\nShit I'll pick Bender off the balcony like Amber Rose\nI have it sewed, you better throw, every punch that you can\nFuck Flight Distance, I'm still waiting for something to land\nWaiting to battle,  but you weren't ready, and you still not\nSo it's turned deadly, 'cause I'ma beat you, with the bottle, you been stuck in since you turned 20\nYou on my last nerve ending and I'm such a cold puncher\nOne hit, 360, no Rolling Stone cover\nSo tell any broke fucker who said my career's deaded\nI'll bring it back to life with no paramedic like Claire Bennet\n\n[Round 3: Bender]\nNow we all talk shit in battles that we're not gon' do actually\nBut I'm concerned with this gun shit you been on, playing that fantasy\nYou talk about drawing them llamas, when you ain't prepared to start clapping P\nThat'd be like drawing Mohammed, real killers might run up and clear out a magazine\nNow part of me almost hopes they let off rounds in this dude\nSplash him and take some years off his life, Fountain of Youth\nLet me get this outta my system\nI hope you get found by some goons, and they put five in The Saurus like a perfect album review\nBack in Vegas he roll with a pack of rats, no Sammy Davis\n'Round here he's signing affidavits all across the San Andreas\nSo I'm not talking 'bout no tracks he make with Planet Asia when I say the factual statement you've collaborated with Cali agents\nMan I'm playin', but it's just like fuck every angle's taken\nYou've battled 650 times on YouTube, no exaggeration,that's amazing\nBut where the fuck did that get you I'm just saying\nI'm thinkin', maybe you shoulda went out in your prime like Amadeus, let me explain\nHe rose to prominence with the Oakland audience\nSo I suppose it's common sense, his old accomplishments of global dominance\nIt started here but grow synonymous with his overconfidence\nBut, you know the consequence, overexposing all this shit\nPromoters jocking him at first reverse, then broke they promises\nYou saw the opponents Okwerdz got, you hurt, won't acknowledge it\nBut every event felt like a knife in your back, that's Roman politics\nWas it your face that look like post-apocalyptic molten lava pits or your gross incompetence making that music no one bothered with\nNow, you just overstayed your welcome, sunk down to the middle tier\nLost all your shit, now they saying you don't belong in this\nHe's battled long depressions 'cause the man is not the legend\nThey're like Santa Claus and penguins, that's polar opposites\nNow he's stacking all his bread up, packed it up moved to the desert\nIn the end, that money's gon' be just another ghost you're haunted with\n'Cause you could stack a mountain of dead presidents like that South Dakota monument\nBut that pot is getting raked 'cause you'll never know when to fold and walk with it\nAnd you deserve it, you treat your fans like shit, ay The Saurus\nI don't mean just being a dick, he rips 'em off, he's made a fortune\nSeven years ago, Kyle Conway bought a verse, you still ain't recorded\nSo if you want a track with Pete, don't hold your breath if he paid you for it\nI thought you had cards up your sleeve, your boy bluffing, I just royal flushed him\nNow who the fuck is Doyle Brunson?\nI said from here on in, I'm only battling legends\nBut if the money's right tell Ness that I might just make an exception\n\n[Round 3: The Saurus]\nYou can diss me for playin' cards, but I just think you're hating\nI made six K last week clicking buttons, how much did you rake in fingerpainting?\nIt doesn't make a difference who oversees it, your ship is sailing\nYoke up, I'll split his egg before it's finished incubating\nFace it, you don't know what getting paid is, till you've raised kids on both sides of the Bay Bridge\nYeah I gamble for a living, but you need to look closer\n'Cause I even made a bet on this battle, I took over\nI ain't come to joke around\nYou know this clown's been broken down and for what was supposed to be my Oakland crowd\nThis is how a closing round's supposed to sound\nExpect no less from me, rep the west, protect the legacy\nBender's dead in three, prep ahead, get the stretcher please\nBefore I got on stage, I double-checked my weaponry\nAnd knew I'd wind up armed from all angles like Dennis Eckersley\nYou're second best to me, I mean, you make tight music\nBut in this battle shit, all you did was take my blueprint\nSo when I see ya' mug, I wanna put a straight right to it\nYou just, got a nose for it like the K-9 unit\nSounding stupid every time I hear this fella force it\nI tell him forfeit, you won't get awarded but I'll give you metal for it\nI'm metamorphing, mad heart and you can tell I poured it into every bar 'cause he got hit so hard he teleported\nYou ready for it, this your time to be heard\nIt's that, word on the street, start biting the curb\nI like beef, your boys wanna fight with me, word\nI lift your entire team like they hired Steve Kerr\nYou can't deter me, ain't nobody moving\nThat's a big red flag, no Soviet Union\nJesus, I'm not religious, I'm only assuming\nYou'll get bodied and whine, that's holy communion\n\n[Forgotten Bender Bars From his 2nd Round]\nI see some bad luck, it's gon' be a fast lunch\nPete's been gassed up like a Vietnam monk\nI'll toss a cigarette butt between his feet then back up\nDead on his feet, feeling like a special elite\nSo fresh and so clean I'm feeling like I've never been beat\nGo on bring up Illmac, that just benefits me\nIt's 2015, he still ain't hit you up for any 16s\nTwo-time World Champion, surpassed by his peers\nSo he's underdog in every battle in the last five years\nWe both had that King Of The Dot chain on and lost the shit\nThe difference is I threw that match and walked like a arsonist\nDon't twist it up I'm tryna cash a paycheck\nShit I been, broke from the jump like Donny Hathaway's neck\nBut what I, don't get's why Lush thought this match would make sense\n'Cause what you, wrote down for months I do with half a day's prep1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/729538", "artist_names": "Merril

stay versatile, with million dollar lifestyle\nAnd I could feel it as a child growing up\nThe niggas that was real\nAnd the niggas that was scared as fuck\nThat's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few\nYou ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you\nSo ease off the trigger-talk, you ain\u2019t killin' shit\nIt\u2019s not affecting me or the niggas that I'm chillin' with\nI don\u2019t believe the hype or buy woof tickets\nNigga, you make a gang of noise and never seen, like a cricket\nI guess that\u2019s why we never kick it\nA lot of niggas is soft and get tossed tryna fuck with the Likwit\nHow many niggas do you know like this?\nAlways claimin' that they ridin' but they really turned bitch\nIt don\u2019t make sense, either you\u2019re a soldier from the start\nOr an actor with a record deal tryna play the part\u2014like that!\n[Chorus]\nIt\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game\nOnly for the money and the fame (Extra large!)\nIt\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game\nOnly for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSee, I don\u2019t need no lights, no cameras; just action, goddamn it\nNever no superstar, I'm more like a planet\nSo my composure is kept while others start to sweat\nEmergin' from the fog with my fucked-up dialogue\nTryna live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt\nAnd niggas you spent it on would not give a fuck\nAnd that\u2019s deep; how deep? It\u2019s deeper than Atlantis\nHome of the scandalous: big bad Los Angeles\nDangerous, vandalous, yo, not to be trusted\nNow, how the fuck is you hard\nNot being scared by the boulevard?\nI'm pullin' that card, and saying \"Gin, mothafucka!\"\nFlowin' like liquid; soak it in, mothafucka!\nI'm breakin' it down, my sound surrounds like death\nFrom the West, puttin' whole counties to the test\nIt\u2019s all in perspective, breaker 1-9 copy\nThis is for the niggas gettin' caught up in the paparazzi\n\n[Chorus]\nIt\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game\nOnly for the money and the fame (Extra large!)\nIt\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game\nOnly for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nNiggas smoke stress and crossdress, but I just play the back\nOthers going through schemes and pipe dreams for a contract\nReal tightly rolled, fuck \u2019em all how I feel\nI made a cool half mill' before I had a record deal\nTherefore you look and stare like it\u2019s magic\nBut too much of anything can make you an addict\nWhenever devils be startin' static, break out the automatic\nI set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate\nBut wait! Who dares to cross this path?\nYo, I do you like math, cut with glass, make a bloodbath\nSo on behalf of all niggas I get drunk with\nSmokin' blunts with, I dispose of your punk shit\nHe-he, and keep it all in perspective\nCarbon copies gettin' caught up in the paparazzi\nOnce again, it's the Likwidation crew\nAnd we return at you like this\n\n[Chorus]\nIt\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap

Physical Funk is the Pump\nAnd the bump which I like to stunts\nAnd this is how I do it, back in the hood\nCan't seem to go without nature's feel good\nCause homies like to feel that wet up and down\nAnd ladies like to feel it deep round and round\nAnd just to put this bomb ass track in context\nEverybody with me if you like sex\n\nOOCHIE COOCHIE LA LA LA OOCHIE COOCHIE\nOOCHIE COOCHIE LA LA LA OOCHIE COOCHIE\n\nAnd nothing like liquid love between the sheets\nAnd if your not a virgin then you'll agree\nIts always so good when junks in your trunks\nPhysical Funk\n\n[Chorus (x2)]Embed"},

ten,[333]\nWe were a gallant company,\nRiding o'er land, and sailing o'er sea.\nOh! but we went merrily![334]\nWe forded the river, and clomb the high hill,\nNever our steeds for a day stood still;\nWhether we lay in the cave or the shed,\nOur sleep fell soft on the hardest bed;\nWhether we couched in our rough capote,[335]\nOn the rougher plank of our gliding boat,\nOr stretched on the beach, or our saddles spread,\nAs a pillow beneath the resting head,\nFresh we woke upon the morrow:\nAll our thoughts and words had scope,\nWe had health, and we had hope,\nToil and travel, but no sorrow.\nWe were of all tongues and creeds;\u2014\nSome were those who counted beads,\nSome of mosque, and some of church,\nAnd some, or I mis-say, of neither;\nYet through the wide world might ye search,\nNor find a motlier crew nor blither.\nBut some are dead, and some are gone,\nAnd some are scattered and alone,\nAnd some are rebels on the hills[336]\nThat look along Epirus' valleys,\nWhere Freedom still at moments rallies,\nAnd pays in blood Oppression's ills;\nAnd some are in a far countree,\nAnd some all restlessly at home;\nBut never more, oh! never, we\nShall meet to revel and to roam.\nBut those hardy days flew cheerily![nz]\nAnd when they now fall drearily,\nMy thoughts, like swallows, skim the main,[337]\nAnd bear my spirit back again\nOver the earth, and through the air,\nA wild bird and a wanderer.\n'Tis this that ever wakes my strain,\nAnd oft, too oft, implores again\nThe few who may endure my lay,[oa]\nTo follow me so far away.\nStranger, wilt thou follow now,\nAnd sit with me on Acro-Corinth's brow?\nI.[338]\nMany a vanished year and age,[ob]\nAnd Tempest's breath, and Battle's rage,\nHave swept o'er Corinth; yet she stands,\nA fortress formed to Freedom's hands.[oc]\nThe Whirlwind's wrath, the Earthquake's shock,\nHave left untouched her hoary rock,\nThe keystone of a land, which still,\nThough fall'n, looks proudly on that hill,\nThe landmark to the double tide\nThat purpling rolls on either side,\nAs if their waters chafed to meet,\nYet pause and crouch beneath her feet.\nBut could the blood before her shed\nSince first Timoleon's brother bled,[339]\nOr baffled Persia's despot fled,\nArise from out the Earth which drank\nThe stream of Slaughter as it sank,\nThat sanguine Ocean would o'erflow\nHer isthmus idly spread below:\nOr could the bones of all the slain,[od]\nWho perished there, be piled again,\nThat rival pyramid would rise\nMore mountain-like, through those clear skies[oe]\nThan yon tower-capp'd Acropolis,\nWhich seems the very clouds to kiss.\nII.\nOn dun Cith\u00e6ron's ridge appears\nThe gleam of twice ten thousand spears;\nAnd downward to the Isthmian plain,\nFrom shore to shore of either main,[of]\nThe tent is pitched, the Crescent shines\nAlong the Moslem's leaguering lines;\nAnd the dusk Spahi's bands[340] advance\nBeneath each bearded Pacha's glance;\nAnd far and wide as eye can reach[og]\nThe turbaned cohorts throng the beach;\nAnd there the Arab's camel kneels,\nAnd there his steed the Tartar wheels;\nThe Turcoman hath left his herd,[341]\nThe sabre round his loins to gird;\nAnd there the volleying thunders pour,\nTill waves grow smoother to the roar.\nThe trench is dug, the cannon's breath\nWings the far hissing globe of death;[342]\nFast whirl the fragments from the wall,\nWhich crumbles with the ponderous ball;\nAnd from that wall the foe replies,\nO'er dusty plain and smoky skies,\nWith fares that answer fast and well\nThe summons of the Infidel.\nIII.\nBut near and nearest to the wall\nOf those who wish and work its fall,\nWith deeper skill in War's black art,\nThan Othman's sons, and high of heart\nAs any Chief that ever stood\nTriumphant in the fields of blood;\nFrom post to post, and deed to deed,\nFast spurring on his reeking steed,\nWhere sallying ranks the trench assail,\nAnd make the foremost Moslem quail;\nOr where the battery, guarded well,\nRemains as yet impregnable,\nAlighting cheerly to inspire\nThe soldier slackening in his fire;\nThe first and freshest of the host\nWhich Stamboul's Sultan there can boast,\nTo guide the follower o'er the field,\nTo point the tube, the lance to wield,\nOr whirl around the bickering blade;\u2014\nWas Alp, the Adrian renegade![343]\n\nIV.\nFrom Venice\u2014once a race of worth\nHis gentle Sires\u2014he drew his birth;\nBut late an exile from her shore,[oh]\nAgainst his countrymen he bore\nThe arms they taught to bear; and now\nThe turban girt his shaven brow.\nThrough many a change had Corinth passed\nWith Greece to Venice' rule at last;\nAnd here, before her walls, with those\nTo Greece and Venice equal foes,\nHe stood a foe, with all the zeal\nWhich young and fiery converts feel,\nWithin whose heated bosom throngs\nThe memory of a thousand wrongs.\nTo him had Venice ceased to be\nHer ancient civic boast\u2014\"the Free;\"\nAnd in the palace of St. Mark\nUnnamed accusers in the dark\nWithin the \"Lion's mouth\" had placed\nA charge against him uneffaced:[344]\nHe fled in time, and saved his life,\nTo waste his future years in strife,[oi]\nThat taught his land how great her loss\nIn him who triumphed o'er the Cross,\n'Gainst which he reared the Crescent high,\nAnd battled to avenge or die.\n\nV.\nCoumourgi[345]\u2014he whose closing scene\nAdorned the triumph of Eugene,\nWhen on Carlowitz' bloody plain,\nThe last and mightiest of the slain,\nHe sank, regretting not to die,\nBut cursed the Christian's victory\u2014\nCoumourgi\u2014can his glory cease,\nThat latest conqueror of Greece,\nTill Christian hands to Greece restore\nThe freedom Venice gave of yore?\nA hundred years have rolled away\nSince he refixed the Moslem's sway;\nAnd now he led the Mussulman,\nAnd gave the guidance of the van\nTo Alp, who well repaid the trust\nBy cities levelled with the dust;\nAnd proved, by many a deed of death,\nHow firm his heart in novel faith.\n\nVI.\nThe walls grew weak; and fast and hot\nAgainst them poured the ceaseless shot,\nWith unabating fury sent\nFrom battery to battlement;\nAnd thunder-like the pealing din[oj]\nRose from each heated culverin;\nAnd here and there some crackling dome\nWas fired before the exploding bomb;\nAnd as the fabric sank beneath\nThe shattering shell's volcanic breath,\nIn red and wreathing columns flashed\nThe flame, as loud the ruin crashed,\nOr into countless meteors driven,\nIts earth-stars melted into heaven;[ok]\nWhose clouds that day grew doubly dun,\nImpervious to the hidden sun,\nWith volumed smoke that slowly grew[ol]\nTo one wide sky of sulphurous hue.\n\nVII.\nBut not for vengeance, long delayed,\nAlone, did Alp, the renegade,\nThe Moslem warriors sternly teach\nHis skill to pierce the promised breach:\nWithin these walls a Maid was pent\nHis hope would win, without consent\nOf that inexorable Sire,\nWhose heart refused him in its ire,\nWhen Alp, beneath his Christian name,\nHer virgin hand aspired to claim.\nIn happier mood, and earlier time,\nWhile unimpeached for traitorous crime,\nGayest in Gondola or Hall,\nHe glittered through the Carnival;\nAnd tuned the softest serenade\nThat e'er on Adria's waters played\nAt midnight to Italian maid.[om]\n\nVIII.\nAnd many deemed her heart was won;\nFor sought by numbers, given to none,\nHad young Francesca's hand remained\nStill by the Church's bonds unchained:\nAnd when the Adriatic bore\nLanciotto to the Paynim shore,\nHer wonted smiles were seen to fail,\nAnd pensive waxed the maid and pale;\nMore constant at confessional,\nMore rare at masque and festival;\nOr seen at such, with downcast eyes,\nWhich conquered hearts they ceased to prize:\nWith listless look she seems to gaze:\nWith humbler care her form arrays;\nHer voice less lively in the song;\nHer step, though light, less fleet among\nThe pairs, on whom the Morning's glance\nBreaks, yet unsated with the dance.\n\nIX.\nSent by the State to guard the land,\n(Which, wrested from the Moslem's hand,[346]\nWhile Sobieski tamed his pride\nBy Buda's wall and Danube's side,[on]\nThe chiefs of Venice wrung away\nFrom Patra to Euboea's bay,)\nMinotti held in Corinth's towers[oo]\nThe Doge's delegated powers,\nWhile yet the pitying eye of Peace\nSmiled o'er her long forgotten Greece:\nAnd ere that faithless truce was broke\nWhich freed her from the unchristian yoke,\nWith him his gentle daughter came;\nNor there, since Menelaus' dame\nForsook her lord and land, to prove\nWhat woes await on lawless love,\nHad fairer form adorned the shore\nThan she, the matchless stranger, bore.[op]\n\nX.\nThe wall is rent, the ruins yawn;\nAnd, with to-morrow's earliest dawn,\nO'er the disjointed mass shall vault\nThe foremost of the fierce assault.\nThe bands are ranked\u2014the chosen van\nOf Tartar and of Mussulman,\nThe full of hope, misnamed \"forlorn,\"[347]\nWho hold the thought of death in scorn,\nAnd win their way with falchion's force,\nOr pave the path with many a corse,\nO'er which the following brave may rise,\nTheir stepping-stone\u2014the last who dies![oq]\n\nXI.\n'Tis midnight: on the mountains brown[348]\nThe cold, round moon shines deeply down;\nBlue roll the waters, blue the sky\nSpreads like an ocean hung on high,\nBespangled with those isles of light,[or][349]\nSo wildly, spiritually bright;\nWho ever gazed upon them shining\nAnd turned to earth without repining,\nNor wished for wings to flee away,\nAnd mix with their eternal ray?\nThe waves on either shore lay there\nCalm, clear, and azure as the air;\nAnd scarce their foam the pebbles shook,\nBut murmured meekly as the brook.\nThe winds were pillowed on the waves;\nThe banners drooped along their staves,\nAnd, as they fell around them furling,\nAbove them shone the crescent curling;\nAnd that deep silence was unbroke,\nSave where the watch his signal spoke,\nSave where the steed neighed oft and shrill,\nAnd echo answered from the hill,\nAnd the wide hum of that wild host\nRustled like leaves from coast to coast,\nAs rose the Muezzin's voice in air\nIn midnight call to wonted prayer;\nIt rose, that chanted mournful strain,\nLike some lone Spirit's o'er the plain:\n'Twas musical, but sadly sweet,\nSuch as when winds and harp-strings meet,\nAnd take a long unmeasured tone,\nTo mortal minstrelsy unknown.[os]\nIt seemed to those within the wall\nA cry prophetic of their fall:\nIt struck even the besieger's ear\nWith something ominous and drear,[350]\nAn undefined and sudden thrill,\nWhich makes the heart a moment still,\nThen beat with quicker pulse, ashamed\nOf that strange sense its silence framed;\nSuch as a sudden passing-bell\nWakes, though but for a stranger's knell.[ot]\n\nXII.\nThe tent of Alp was on the shore;\nThe sound was hushed, the prayer was o'er;\nThe watch was set, the night-round made,\nAll mandates issued and obeyed:\n'Tis but another anxious night,\nHis pains the morrow may requite\nWith all Revenge and Love can pay,\nIn guerdon for their long delay.\nFew hours remain, and he hath need\nOf rest, to nerve for many a deed\nOf slaughter; but within his soul\nThe thoughts like troubled waters roll.[ou]\nHe stood alone among the host;\nNot his the loud fanatic boast\nTo plant the Crescent o'er the Cross,\nOr risk a life with little loss,\nSecure in paradise to be\nBy Houris loved immortally:\nNor his, what burning patriots feel,\nThe stern exaltedness of zeal,\nProfuse of blood, untired in toil,\nWhen battling on the parent soil.\nHe stood alone\u2014a renegade\nAgainst the country he betrayed;\nHe stood alone amidst his band,\nWithout a trusted heart or hand:\nThey followed him, for he was brave,\nAnd great the spoil he got and gave;\nThey crouched to him, for he had skill\nTo warp and wield the vulgar will:[ov]\nBut still his Christian origin\nWith them was little less than sin.\nThey envied even the faithless fame\nHe earned beneath a Moslem name;\nSince he, their mightiest chief, had been\nIn youth a bitter Nazarene.\nThey did not know how Pride can stoop,\nWhen baffled feelings withering droop;\nThey did not know how Hate can burn\nIn hearts once changed from soft to stern;\nNor all the false and fatal zeal\nThe convert of Revenge can feel.\nHe ruled them\u2014man may rule the worst,\nBy ever daring to be first:\nSo lions o'er the jackals sway;\nThe jackal points, he fells the prey,[ow][351]\nThen on the vulgar, yelling, press,\nTo gorge the relics of success.\n\nXIII.\nHis head grows fevered, and his pulse\nThe quick successive throbs convulse;\nIn vain from side to side he throws\nHis form, in courtship of repose;[ox]\nOr if he dozed, a sound, a start\nAwoke him with a sunken heart.\nThe turban on his hot brow pressed,\nThe mail weighed lead-like on his breast,\nThough oft and long beneath its weight\nUpon his eyes had slumber sate,\nWithout or couch or canopy,\nExcept a rougher field and sky[oy]\nThan now might yield a warrior's bed,\nThan now along the heaven was spread.\nHe could not rest, he could not stay\nWithin his tent to wait for day,[oz]\nBut walked him forth along the sand,\nWhere thousand sleepers strewed the strand.\nWhat pillowed them? and why should he\nMore wakeful than the humblest be,\nSince more their peril, worse their toil?\nAnd yet they fearless dream of spoil;\nWhile he alone, where thousands passed\nA night of sleep, perchance their last,\nIn sickly vigil wandered on,\nAnd envied all he gazed upon.\n\nXIV.\nHe felt his soul become more light\nBeneath the freshness of the night.\nCool was the silent sky, though calm,\nAnd bathed his brow with airy balm:\nBehind, the camp\u2014before him lay,\nIn many a winding creek and bay,\nLepanto's gulf; and, on the brow\nOf Delphi's hill, unshaken snow,[pa]\nHigh and eternal, such as shone\nThrough thousand summers brightly gone,\nAlong the gulf, the mount, the clime;\nIt will not melt, like man, to time:\nTyrant and slave are swept away,\nLess formed to wear before the ray;\nBut that white veil, the lightest, frailest,[352]\nWhich on the mighty mount thou hailest,\nWhile tower and tree are torn and rent,\nShines o'er its craggy battlement;\nIn form a peak, in height a cloud,\nIn texture like a hovering shroud,\nThus high by parting Freedom spread,\nAs from her fond abode she fled,\nAnd lingered on the spot, where long\nHer prophet spirit spake in song.[pb]\nOh! still her step at moments falters\nO'er withered fields, and ruined altars,\nAnd fain would wake, in souls too broken,\nBy pointing to each glorious token:\nBut vain her voice, till better days\nDawn in those yet remembered rays,\nWhich shone upon the Persian flying,\nAnd saw the Spartan smile in dying.\n\nXV.\nNot mindless of these mighty times\nWas Alp, despite his flight and crimes;\nAnd through this night, as on he wandered,[pc]\nAnd o'er the past and present pondered,\nAnd thought upon the glorious dead\nWho there in better cause had bled,\nHe felt how faint and feebly dim[pd]\nThe fame that could accrue to him,\nWho cheered the band, and waved the sword,[pe]\nA traitor in a turbaned horde;\nAnd led them to the lawless siege,\nWhose best success were sacrilege.\nNot so had those his fancy numbered,[353]\nThe chiefs whose dust around him slumbered;\nTheir phalanx marshalled on the plain,\nWhose bulwarks were not then in vain.\nThey fell devoted, but undying;\nThe very gale their names seemed sighing;\nThe waters murmured of their name;\nThe woods were peopled with their fame;\nThe silent pillar, lone and grey,\nClaimed kindred with their sacred clay;\nTheir spirits wrapped the dusky mountain,\nTheir memory sparkled o'er the fountain;[pf]\nThe meanest rill, the mightiest river\nRolled mingling with their fame for ever.\nDespite of every yoke she bears,\nThat land is Glory's still and theirs![pg]\n'Tis still a watch-word to the earth:\nWhen man would do a deed of worth\nHe points to Greece, and turns to tread,\nSo sanctioned, on the tyrant's head:\nHe looks to her, and rushes on\nWhere life is lost, or Freedom won.[ph]\n\nXVI.\nStill by the shore Alp mutely mused,\nAnd wooed the freshness Night diffused.\nThere shrinks no ebb in that tideless sea,[354]\nWhich changeless rolls eternally;\nSo that wildest of waves, in their angriest mood,[pi]\nScarce break on the bounds of the land for a rood;\nAnd the powerless moon beholds them flow,\nHeedless if she come or go:\nCalm or high, in main or bay,\nOn their course she hath no sway.\nThe rock unworn its base doth bare,\nAnd looks o'er the surf, but it comes not there;\nAnd the fringe of the foam may be seen below,\nOn the line that it left long ages ago:\nA smooth short space of yellow sand[pj][355]\nBetween it and the greener land.\nHe wandered on along the beach,\nTill within the range of a carbine's reach\nOf the leaguered wall; but they saw him not,\nOr how could he 'scape from the hostile shot?[pk]\nDid traitors lurk in the Christians' hold?\nWere their hands grown stiff, or their hearts waxed cold?\nI know not, in sooth; but from yonder wall[pl]\nThere flashed no fire, and there hissed no ball,\nThough he stood beneath the bastion's frown,\nThat flanked the seaward gate of the town;\nThough he heard the sound, and could almost tell\nThe sullen words of the sentinel,\nAs his measured step on the stone below\nClanked, as he paced it to and fro;\nAnd he saw the lean dogs beneath the wall\nHold o'er the dead their Carnival,[356]\nGorging and growling o'er carcass and limb;\nThey were too busy to bark at him!\nFrom a Tartar's skull they had stripped the flesh,\nAs ye peel the fig when its fruit is fresh;\nAnd their white tusks crunched o'er the whiter skull,[357]\nAs it slipped through their jaws, when their edge grew dull,\nAs they lazily mumbled the bones of the dead,\nWhen they scarce could rise from the spot where they fed;\nSo well had they broken a lingering fast\nWith those who had fallen for that night's repast.\nAnd Alp knew, by the turbans that rolled on the sand,\nThe foremost of these were the best of his band:\nCrimson and green were the shawls of their wear,\nAnd each scalp had a single long tuft of hair,[358]\nAll the rest was shaven and bare.\nThe scalps were in the wild dog's maw,\nThe hair was tangled round his jaw:\nBut close by the shore, on the edge of the gulf,\nThere sat a vulture flapping a wolf,\nWho had stolen from the hills, but kept away,\nScared by the dogs, from the human prey;\nBut he seized on his share of a steed that lay,\nPicked by the birds, on the sands of the bay.\n\nXVII.\nAlp turned him from the sickening sight:\nNever had shaken his nerves in fight;\nBut he better could brook to behold the dying,\nDeep in the tide of their warm blood lying,[pm][359]\nScorched with the death-thirst, and writhing in vain,\nThan the perishing dead who are past all pain.[pn][360]\nThere is something of pride in the perilous hour,\nWhate'er be the shape in which Death may lower;\nFor Fame is there to say who bleeds,\nAnd Honour's eye on daring deeds![361]\nBut when all is past, it is humbling to tread[po]\nO'er the weltering field of the tombless dead,[362]\nAnd see worms of the earth, and fowls of the air,\nBeasts of the forest, all gathering there;\nAll regarding man as their prey,\nAll rejoicing in his decay.[pp]\n\nXVIII.\nThere is a temple in ruin stands,\nFashioned by long forgotten hands;\nTwo or three columns, and many a stone,\nMarble and granite, with grass o'ergrown!\nOut upon Time! it will leave no more\nOf the things to come than the things before![pq][363]\nOut upon Time! who for ever will leave\nBut enough of the past for the future to grieve\nO'er that which hath been, and o'er that which must be:\nWhat we have seen, our sons shall see;\nRemnants of things that have passed away,\nFragments of stone, reared by creatures of clay![pr]\n\nXIX.\nHe sate him down at a pillar's base,[364]\nAnd passed his hand athwart his face;\nLike one in dreary musing mood,\nDeclining was his attitude;\nHis head was drooping on his breast,\nFevered, throbbing, and oppressed;\nAnd o'er his brow, so downward bent,\nOft his beating fingers went,\nHurriedly, as you may see\nYour own run over the ivory key,\nEre the measured tone is taken\nBy the chords you would awaken.\nThere he sate all heavily,\nAs he heard the night-wind sigh.\nWas it the wind through some hollow stone,[ps]\nSent that soft and tender moan?[365]\nHe lifted his head, and he looked on the sea,\nBut it was unrippled as glass may be;\nHe looked on the long grass\u2014it waved not a blade;\nHow was that gentle sound conveyed?\nHe looked to the banners\u2014each flag lay still,\nSo did the leaves on Cith\u00e6ron's hill,\nAnd he felt not a breath come over his cheek;\nWhat did that sudden sound bespeak? 530\nHe turned to the left\u2014is he sure of sight?\nThere sate a lady, youthful and bright![pt][366]\n\nXX.\nHe started up with more of fear\nThan if an arm\u00e9d foe were near.\n\"God of my fathers! what is here?\nWho art thou? and wherefore sent\nSo near a hostile armament?\"\nHis trembling hands refused to sign\nThe cross he deemed no more divine:\nHe had resumed it in that hour,[pu]\nBut Conscience wrung away the power.\nHe gazed, he saw; he knew the face\nOf beauty, and the form of grace;\nIt was Francesca by his side,\nThe maid who might have been his bride![pv]\nThe rose was yet upon her cheek,\nBut mellowed with a tenderer streak:\nWhere was the play of her soft lips fled?\nGone was the smile that enlivened their red.\nThe Ocean's calm within their view,[pw]\nBeside her eye had less of blue;\nBut like that cold wave it stood still,\nAnd its glance, though clear, was chill.[367]\nAround her form a thin robe twining,\nNought concealed her bosom shining;\nThrough the parting of her hair,\nFloating darkly downward there,\nHer rounded arm showed white and bare:\nAnd ere yet she made reply,\nOnce she raised her hand on high;\nIt was so wan, and transparent of hue,\nYou might have seen the moon shine through.\n\nXXI.\n\"I come from my rest to him I love best,\nThat I may be happy, and he may be blessed.\nI have passed the guards, the gate, the wall;\nSought thee in safety through foes and all.\n'Tis said the lion will turn and flee[368]\nFrom a maid in the pride of her purity;\nAnd the Power on high, that can shield the good\nThus from the tyrant of the wood,\nHath extended its mercy to guard me as well\nFrom the hands of the leaguering Infidel.\nI come\u2014and if I come in vain,\nNever, oh never, we meet again!\nThou hast done a fearful deed\nIn falling away from thy fathers' creed:\nBut dash that turban to earth, and sign\nThe sign of the cross, and for ever be mine;\nWring the black drop from thy heart,\nAnd to-morrow unites us no more to part.\"\n\"And where should our bridal couch be spread?\nIn the midst of the dying and the dead?\nFor to-morrow we give to the slaughter and flame\nThe sons and the shrines of the Christian name.\nNone, save thou and thine, I've sworn,\nShall be left upon the morn:\nBut thee will I bear to a lovely spot,\nWhere our hands shall be joined, and our sorrow forgot.\nThere thou yet shall be my bride,\nWhen once again I've quelled the pride\nOf Venice; and her hated race\nHave felt the arm they would debase\nScourge, with a whip of scorpions, those\nWhom Vice and Envy made my foes.\"\nUpon his hand she laid her own\u2014\nLight was the touch, but it thrilled to the bone,\nAnd shot a chillness to his heart,[px]\nWhich fixed him beyond the power to start.\nThough slight was that grasp so mortal cold,\nHe could not loose him from its hold;\nBut never did clasp of one so dear\nStrike on the pulse with such feeling of fear,\nAs those thin fingers, long and white,\nFroze through his blood by their touch that night.\nThe feverish glow of his brow was gone,\nAnd his heart sank so still that it felt like stone,\nAs he looked on the face, and beheld its hue,[py]\nSo deeply changed from what he knew:\nFair but faint\u2014without the ray\nOf mind, that made each feature play\nLike sparkling waves on a sunny day;\nAnd her motionless lips lay still as death,\nAnd her words came forth without her breath,\nAnd there rose not a heave o'er her bosom's swell,[pz]\nAnd there seemed not a pulse in her veins to dwell.\nThough her eye shone out, yet the lids were fixed,[369]\nAnd the glance that it gave was wild and unmixed\nWith aught of change, as the eyes may seem\nOf the restless who walk in a troubled dream;\nLike the figures on arras, that gloomily glare,\nStirred by the breath of the wintry air[qa]\nSo seen by the dying lamp's fitful light,[qb]\nLifeless, but life-like, and awful to sight;\nAs they seem, through the dimness, about to come down\nFrom the shadowy wall where their images frown;\nFearfully flitting to and fro,\nAs the gusts on the tapestry come and go.[370]\n\"If not for love of me be given\nThus much, then, for the love of Heaven,\u2014\nAgain I say\u2014that turban tear\nFrom off thy faithless brow, and swear\nThine injured country's sons to spare,\nOr thou art lost; and never shalt see\u2014\nNot earth\u2014that's past\u2014but Heaven or me.\nIf this thou dost accord, albeit\nA heavy doom' tis thine to meet,\nThat doom shall half absolve thy sin,\nAnd Mercy's gate may receive thee within:[371]\nBut pause one moment more, and take\nThe curse of Him thou didst forsake;\nAnd look once more to Heaven, and see\nIts love for ever shut from thee.\nThere is a light cloud by the moon\u2014[372]\n'Tis passing, and will pass full soon\u2014\nIf, by the time its vapoury sail\nHath ceased her shaded orb to veil,\nThy heart within thee is not changed,\nThen God and man are both avenged;\nDark will thy doom be, darker still\nThine immortality of ill.\"\nAlp looked to heaven, and saw on high\nThe sign she spake of in the sky;\nBut his heart was swollen, and turned aside,\nBy deep interminable pride.[qc]\nThis first false passion of his breast\nRolled like a torrent o'er the rest.\nHe sue for mercy! He dismayed\nBy wild words of a timid maid!\nHe, wronged by Venice, vow to save\nHer sons, devoted to the grave!\nNo\u2014though that cloud were thunder's worst,\nAnd charged to crush him\u2014let it burst!\nHe looked upon it earnestly,\nWithout an accent of reply;\nHe watched it passing; it is flown:\nFull on his eye the clear moon shone,\nAnd thus he spake\u2014\"Whate'er my fate,\nI am no changeling\u2014'tis too late:\nThe reed in storms may bow and quiver,\nThen rise again; the tree must shiver.\nWhat Venice made me, I must be,\nHer foe in all, save love to thee:\nBut thou art safe: oh, fly with me!\"\nHe turned, but she is gone!\nNothing is there but the column stone.\nHath she sunk in the earth, or melted in air?\nHe saw not\u2014he knew not\u2014but nothing is there.\n\nXXII.\nThe night is past, and shines the sun\nAs if that morn were a jocund one.[373]\nLightly and brightly breaks away\nThe Morning from her mantle grey,[374]\nAnd the Noon will look on a sultry day.[375]\nHark to the trump, and the drum,\nAnd the mournful sound of the barbarous horn,\nAnd the flap of the banners, that flit as they're borne,\nAnd the neigh of the steed, and the multitude's hum,\nAnd the clash, and the shout, \"They come! they come!\"\nThe horsetails[376] are plucked from the ground, and the sword\nFrom its sheath; and they form, and but wait for the word.\nTartar, and Spahi, and Turcoman,\nStrike your tents, and throng to the van;\nMount ye, spur ye, skirr the plain,[377]\nThat the fugitive may flee in vain,\nWhen he breaks from the town; and none escape,\nAg\u00e9d or young, in the Christian shape;\nWhile your fellows on foot, in a fiery mass,\nBloodstain the breach through which they pass.[378]\nThe steeds are all bridled, and snort to the rein;\nCurved is each neck, and flowing each mane;\nWhite is the foam of their champ on the bit;\nThe spears are uplifted; the matches are lit;\nThe cannon are pointed, and ready to roar,\nAnd crush the wall they have crumbled before:[379]\nForms in his phalanx each Janizar;\nAlp at their head; his right arm is bare,\nSo is the blade of his scimitar;\nThe Khan and the Pachas are all at their post;\nThe Vizier himself at the head of the host.\nWhen the culverin's signal is fired, then on;\nLeave not in Corinth a living one\u2014\nA priest at her altars, a chief in her halls,\nA hearth in her mansions, a stone on her walls.\nGod and the prophet\u2014Alla Hu![380]\nUp to the skies with that wild halloo!\n\"There the breach lies for passage, the ladder to scale;\nAnd your hands on your sabres, and how should ye fail?\nHe who first downs with the red cross may crave[381]\nHis heart's dearest wish; let him ask it, and have!\"\nThus uttered Coumourgi, the dauntless Vizier;[382]\nThe reply was the brandish of sabre and spear,\nAnd the shout of fierce thousands in joyous ire:\u2014\nSilence\u2014hark to the signal\u2014fire!\n\nXXIII.\nAs the wolves, that headlong go\nOn the stately buffalo,\nThough with fiery eyes, and angry roar,\nAnd hoofs that stamp, and horns that gore,\nHe tramples on earth, or tosses on high\nThe foremost, who rush on his strength but to die\nThus against the wall they went,\nThus the first were backward bent;[383]\nMany a bosom, sheathed in brass,\nStrewed the earth like broken glass,[qd]\nShivered by the shot, that tore\nThe ground whereon they moved no more:\nEven as they fell, in files they lay,\nLike the mower's grass at the close of day,[qe]\nWhen his work is done on the levelled plain;\nSuch was the fall of the foremost slain.[384]\n\nXXIV.\nAs the spring-tides, with heavy plash,\nFrom the cliffs invading dash\nHuge fragments, sapped by the ceaseless flow,\nTill white and thundering down they go,\nLike the avalanche's snow\nOn the Alpine vales below;\nThus at length, outbreathed and worn,\nCorinth's sons were downward borne\nBy the long and oft renewed\nCharge of the Moslem multitude.\nIn firmness they stood, and in masses they fell,\nHeaped by the host of the Infidel,\nHand to hand, and foot to foot:\nNothing there, save Death, was mute;[385]\nStroke, and thrust, and flash, and cry\nFor quarter, or for victory,\nMingle there with the volleying thunder,\nWhich makes the distant cities wonder\nHow the sounding battle goes,\nIf with them, or for their foes;\nIf they must mourn, or may rejoice\nIn that annihilating voice,\nWhich pierces the deep hills through and through\nWith an echo dread and new:\nYou might have heard it, on that day,\nO'er Salamis and Megara;\n(We have heard the hearers say,)[qf]\nEven unto Pir\u00e6us' bay.\n\nXXV.\nFrom the point of encountering blades to the hilt,\nSabres and swords with blood were gilt;[386]\nBut the rampart is won, and the spoil begun,\nAnd all but the after carnage done.\nShriller shrieks now mingling come\nFrom within the plundered dome:\nHark to the haste of flying feet,\nThat splash in the blood of the slippery street;\nBut here and there, where 'vantage ground\nAgainst the foe may still be found,\nDesperate groups, of twelve or ten,\nMake a pause, and turn again\u2014\nWith banded backs against the wall,\nFiercely stand, or fighting fall.\nThere stood an old man[387]\u2014his hairs were white,\nBut his veteran arm was full of might:\nSo gallantly bore he the brunt of the fray,\nThe dead before him, on that day,\nIn a semicircle lay;\nStill he combated unwounded,\nThough retreating, unsurrounded.\nMany a scar of former fight\nLurked[388] beneath his corslet bright;\nBut of every wound his body bore,\nEach and all had been ta'en before:\nThough ag\u00e9d, he was so iron of limb,\nFew of our youth could cope with him,\nAnd the foes, whom he singly kept at bay,\nOutnumbered his thin hairs[389] of silver grey.\nFrom right to left his sabre swept:\nMany an Othman mother wept\nSons that were unborn, when dipped[390]\nHis weapon first in Moslem gore,\nEre his years could count a score.\nOf all he might have been the sire[391]\nWho fell that day beneath his ire:\nFor, sonless left long years ago,\nHis wrath made many a childless foe;\nAnd since the day, when in the strait[392]\nHis only boy had met his fate,\nHis parent's iron hand did doom\nMore than a human hecatomb.[393]\nIf shades by carnage be appeased,\nPatroclus' spirit less was pleased\nThan his, Minotti's son, who died\nWhere Asia's bounds and ours divide.\nBuried he lay, where thousands before\nFor thousands of years were inhumed on the shore;\nWhat of them is left, to tell\nWhere they lie, and how they fell?\nNot a stone on their turf, nor a bone in their graves;\nBut they live in the verse that immortally saves.[394]\n\nXXVI.\nHark to the Allah shout![395] a band\nOf the Mussulman bravest and best is at hand;\nTheir leader's nervous arm is bare,\nSwifter to smite, and never to spare\u2014\nUnclothed to the shoulder it waves them on;\nThus in the fight is he ever known:\nOthers a gaudier garb may show,\nTo tempt the spoil of the greedy foe;\nMany a hand's on a richer hilt,\nBut none on a steel more ruddily gilt;\nMany a loftier turban may wear,\u2014\nAlp is but known by the white arm bare;\nLook through the thick of the fight,'tis there!\nThere is not a standard on that shore\nSo well advanced the ranks before;\nThere is not a banner in Moslem war\nWill lure the Delhis half so far;\nIt glances like a falling star!\nWhere'er that mighty arm is seen,\nThe bravest be, or late have been;[396]\nThere the craven cries for quarter\nVainly to the vengeful Tartar;\nOr the hero, silent lying,\nScorns to yield a groan in dying;\nMustering his last feeble blow\n'Gainst the nearest levelled foe,\nThough faint beneath the mutual wound,\nGrappling on the gory ground.\n\nXXVII.\nStill the old man stood erect.\nAnd Alp's career a moment checked.\n\"Yield thee, Minotti; quarter take,\nFor thine own, thy daughter's sake.\"\n\"Never, Renegado, never!\nThough the life of thy gift would last for ever.\"[qg]\n\"Francesca!\u2014Oh, my promised bride![qh]\nMust she too perish by thy pride!\"\n\"She is safe.\"\u2014\"Where? where?\"\u2014\"In Heaven;\nFrom whence thy traitor soul is driven\u2014\nFar from thee, and undefiled.\"\nGrimly then Minotti smiled,\nAs he saw Alp staggering bow\nBefore his words, as with a blow.\n\"Oh God! when died she?\"\u2014\"Yesternight\u2014\nNor weep I for her spirit's flight:\nNone of my pure race shall be\nSlaves to Mahomet and thee\u2014\nCome on!\"\u2014That challenge is in vain\u2014\nAlp's already with the slain!\nWhile Minotti's words were wreaking\nMore revenge in bitter speaking\nThan his falchion's point had found,\nHad the time allowed to wound,\nFrom within the neighbouring porch\nOf a long defended church,\nWhere the last and desperate few\nWould the failing fight renew,\nThe sharp shot dashed Alp to the ground;\nEre an eye could view the wound\nThat crashed through the brain of the infidel,\nRound he spun, and down he fell;[\nA flash like fire within his eyes\nBlazed, as he bent no more to rise,\nAnd then eternal darkness sunk\nThrough all the palpitating trunk;[qi]\nNought of life left, save a quivering\nWhere his limbs were slightly shivering:\nThey turned him on his back; his breast\nAnd brow were stained with gore and dust,\nAnd through his lips the life-blood oozed,\nFrom its deep veins lately loosed;\nBut in his pulse there was no throb,\nNor on his lips one dying sob;\nSigh, nor word, nor struggling breath[qj]\nHeralded his way to death:\nEre his very thought could pray,\nUnaneled he passed away,\nWithout a hope from Mercy's aid,\u2014\nTo the last a Renegade.[397]\n\nXXVIII.\nFearfully the yell arose\nOf his followers, and his foes;\nThese in joy, in fury those:[qk]\nThen again in conflict mixing,[ql]\nClashing swords, and spears transfixing,\nInterchanged the blow and thrust,\nHurling warriors in the dust.\nStreet by street, and foot by foot,\nStill Minotti dares dispute\nThe latest portion of the land\nLeft beneath his high command;\nWith him, aiding heart and hand,\nThe remnant of his gallant band.\nStill the church is tenable,\nWhence issued late the fated ball\nThat half avenged the city's fall,\nWhen Alp, her fierce assailant, fell:\nThither bending sternly back,\nThey leave before a bloody track;\nAnd, with their faces to the foe,\nDealing wounds with every blow,[398]\nThe chief, and his retreating train,\nJoin to those within the fane;\nThere they yet may breathe awhile,\nSheltered by the massy pile.\n\nXXIX.\nBrief breathing-time! the turbaned host,\nWith added ranks and raging boast,\nPress onwards with such strength and heat,\nTheir numbers balk their own retreat;\nFor narrow the way that led to the spot\nWhere still the Christians yielded not;\nAnd the foremost, if fearful, may vainly try\nThrough the massy column to turn and fly;\nThey perforce must do or die.\nThey die; but ere their eyes could close,\nAvengers o'er their bodies rose;\nFresh and furious, fast they fill\nThe ranks unthinned, though slaughtered still;\nAnd faint the weary Christians wax\nBefore the still renewed attacks:\nAnd now the Othmans gain the gate;\nStill resists its iron weight,\nAnd still, all deadly aimed and hot,\nFrom every crevice comes the shot;\nFrom every shattered window pour\nThe volleys of the sulphurous shower:\nBut the portal wavering grows and weak\u2014\nThe iron yields, the hinges creak\u2014\nIt bends\u2014it falls\u2014and all is o'er;\nLost Corinth may resist no more!\n\nXXX.\nDarkly, sternly, and all alone,\nMinotti stood o'er the altar stone:\nMadonna's face upon him shone,[399]\nPainted in heavenly hues above,\nWith eyes of light and looks of love;\nAnd placed upon that holy shrine\nTo fix our thoughts on things divine,\nWhen pictured there, we kneeling see\nHer, and the boy-God on her knee,\nSmiling sweetly on each prayer\nTo Heaven, as if to waft it there.\nStill she smiled; even now she smiles,\nThough slaughter streams along her aisles:\nMinotti lifted his ag\u00e9d eye,\nAnd made the sign of a cross with a sigh,\nThen seized a torch which blazed thereby;\nAnd still he stood, while with steel and flame,\nInward and onward the Mussulman came.\n\nXXXI.\nThe vaults beneath the mosaic stone[qm]\nContained the dead of ages gone;\nTheir names were on the graven floor,\nBut now illegible with gore;[qn]\nThe carv\u00e9d crests, and curious hues\nThe varied marble's veins diffuse,\nWere smeared, and slippery\u2014stained, and strown\nWith broken swords, and helms o'erthrown:\nThere were dead above, and the dead below\nLay cold in many a coffined row;\nYou might see them piled in sable state,\nBy a pale light through a gloomy grate;\nBut War had entered their dark caves,[qo]\nAnd stored along the vaulted graves\nHer sulphurous treasures, thickly spread\nIn masses by the fleshless dead:\nHere, throughout the siege, had been\nThe Christians' chiefest magazine;\nTo these a late formed train now led,\nMinotti's last and stern resource\nAgainst the foe's o'erwhelming force.\n\nXXXII.\nThe foe came on, and few remain\nTo strive, and those must strive in vain:\nFor lack of further lives, to slake\nThe thirst of vengeance now awake,\nWith barbarous blows they gash the dead,\nAnd lop the already lifeless head,\nAnd fell the statues from their niche,\nAnd spoil the shrines of offerings rich,\nAnd from each other's rude hands wrest\nThe silver vessels Saints had blessed.\nTo the high altar on they go;\nOh, but it made a glorious

The original idea undoubtedly pertains to Mr. Coleridge, whose poem has been composed above fourteen years. Let me conclude by a hope that he will not longer delay the publication of a production, of which I can only add my mite of approbation to the applause of far more competent judges.\n[The lines in Christabel, Part the First, 43-52, 57, 58, are these\u2014\n\"The night is chill; the forest bare;\nIs it the wind that moaneth bleak?\nThere is not wind enough in the air\nTo move away the ringlet curl\nFrom the lovely lady's cheek\u2014\nThere is not wind enough to twirl\nThe one red leaf, the last of its clan,\nThat dances as often as dance it can,\nHanging so light, and hanging so high,\nOn the topmost twig that looks up at the sky.\"\n\" ... What sees she there?\nThere she sees a damsel bright,\nDrest in a silken robe of white.\"\nByron (vide ante, p. 443), in a letter to Coleridge, dated October 27, 1815, had already expressly guarded himself against a charge of plagiarism, by explaining that lines 521-532 of stanza xix. were written before he heard Walter Scott repeat Christabel in the preceding June. Now, as Byron himself perceived, perhaps for the first time, when he had the MS. of Christabel before him, the coincidence in language and style between the two passages is unquestionable; and, as he hoped and expected that Coleridge's fragment, when completed, would issue from the press, he was anxious to avoid even the semblance of pilfering, and went so far as to suggest that the passage should be cancelled. Neither in the private letter nor the published note does Byron attempt to deny or explain away the coincidence, but pleads that his lines were written before he had heard Coleridge's poem recited, and that he had not been guilty of a \"wilful plagiarism.\" There is no difficulty in accepting his statement. Long before the summer of 1815 Christabel \"had a pretty general circulation in the literary world\" (Medwin, Conversations, 1824, p. 261), and he may have heard without heeding this and other passages quoted by privileged readers; or, though never a line of Christabel had sounded in his ears, he may (as K\u00f6lbing points out) have caught its lilt at second hand from the published works of Southey, or of Scott himself.\nCompare Thalaba the Destroyer, v. 20 (1838, iv. 187)\u2014\n\"What sound is borne on the wind?\nIs it the storm that shakes\nThe thousand oaks of the forest?\nIs it the river's roar\nDashed down some rocky descent?\" etc.\nOr compare The Lay of the Last Minstrel, I. xii. 5. seq. (1812, p. 24)\u2014\n\"And now she sits in secret bower\nIn old Lord David's western tower,\nAnd listens to a heavy sound,\nThat moans the mossy turrets round.\nIs it the roar of Teviot's tide,\nThat chafes against the scaur's red side?\nIs it the wind that swings the oaks?\nIs it the echo from the rocks?\" etc.\nCertain lines of Coleridge's did, no doubt, \"find themselves\" in the Siege of Corinth, having found their way to the younger poet's ear and fancy before the Lady of the vision was directly and formally introduced to his notice.]\n\n[pt] {473}There sate a lady young and bright.\u2014[MS.

The Critical Review (February, 1816, vol. iii. p. 151) remarks that \"the following couplet [i.e. lines 531, 532] reminds us of the persiflage of Lewis or the pathos of a vulgar ballad;\" while the Dublin Examiner (May, 1816, vol. i. p. 19) directs a double charge against the founders of the schism and their proselyte: \"If the Cumberland Lakers were not well known to be personages of the most pious and saintly temperament, we would really have serious apprehensions lest our noble Poet should come to any harm in consequence of the envy which the two following lines and a great many others through the poems, might excite by their successful rivalship of some of the finest effects of babyism that these Gentlemen can boast.\"]\n\n[pu] He would have made it\u2014\u2014.\u2014[MS.

Compare Lara, Canto I. stanza xi. line 1, seq. (vide ante, p. 331, note 1).]\n\n[371] [Compare Southey's Roderick, Canto XXI. (ed. 1838, ix. 195)\u2014\n\" ... and till the grave\nOpen, the gate of mercy is not closed.\"]\n\n[372] {478} I have been told that the idea expressed in this and the five following lines has been admired by those whose approbation is valuable. I am glad of it; but it is not original\u2014at least not mine; it may be found much better expressed in pages 182-3-4 of the English version of \"Vathek\" (I forget the precise page of the French), a work to which I have before referred; and never recur to, or read, without a renewal of gratification.\u2014[The following is the passage: \"'Deluded prince!' said the Genius, addressing the Caliph ... 'This moment is the last, of grace, allowed thee: ... give back Nouronihar to her father, who still retains a few sparks of life: destroy thy tower, with all its abominations: drive Carathis from thy councils: be just to thy subjects: respect the ministers of the Prophet: compensate for thy impieties by an exemplary life; and, instead of squandering thy days in voluptuous indulgence, lament thy crimes on the sepulchres of thy ancestors. Thou beholdest the clouds that obscure the sun: at the instant he recovers his splendour, if thy heart be not changed, the time of mercy assigned thee will be past for ever.'\"\n\n\"Vathek, depressed with fear, was on the point of prostrating himself at the feet of the shepherd ... but, his pride prevailing ... he said, 'Whoever thou art, withhold thy useless admonitions.... If what I have done be so criminal ... there remains not for me a moment of grace. I have traversed a sea of blood to acquire a power which will make thy equals tremble; deem not that I shall retire when in view of the port; or that I will relinquish her who is dearer to me than either my life or thy mercy. Let the sun appear! let him illumine my career! it matters not where it may end!' On uttering these words ... Vathek ... commanded that his horses should be forced back to the road.\n\"There was no difficulty in obeying these orders; for the attraction had ceased; the sun shone forth in all his glory, and the shepherd vanished with a lamentable scream\" (ed. 1786, pp. 183-185).]\n\n[qc] {479} By rooted and unhallowed pride.\u2014[MS.

Byron himself, in Don Juan (\"Dedication,\" stanza i. line 5), hails Southey as \"My Epic Renegade!\" Compare, too, stanza xiv. of \"Lines addressed to a Noble Lord (His Lordship will know why), By one of the small Fry of the Lakes\" (i.e. Miss Barker, the \"Bhow Begum\" of Southey's Doctor)\u2014\n\"And our Ponds shall better please thee,\nThan those now dishonoured seas,\nWith their shores and Cyclades\nStocked with Pachas, Seraskiers,\nSlaves and turbaned Buccaneers;\nSensual Mussulmans atrocious,\nRenegadoes more ferocious,\" etc.]\n\n[qk] {489} These in rage, in triumph those.\u2014[MS.

Nobody but S....y has done any thing worth a slice of bookseller's pudding, and he has not luck enough to be found out in doing a good thing,\" implies that Byron had read and admired Southey's Roderick\u2014an inference which is curiously confirmed by a memorandum in Murray's handwriting: \"When Southey's poem, Don Roderick (sic), was published, Lord Byron sent in the middle of the night to ask John Murray if he had heard any opinion of it, for he thought it one of the finest poems he had ever read.\" The resemblance between the two passages, which is pointed out by Professor K\u00f6lbing, is too close to be wholly unconscious, but Byron's expansion of Southey's lines hardly amounts to a plagiarism.]1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path":

Du Bois", "lyrics": "Darkwater (Chap. 10) LyricsThe Comet\n\nHe stood a moment on the steps of the bank, watching the human river that swirled down Broadway. Few noticed him. Few ever noticed him save in a way that stung. He was outside the world\u2014\"nothing!\" as he said bitterly. Bits of the words of the walkers came to him.\n\n\"The comet?\"\n\n\"The comet\u2014\u2014\"\n\nEverybody was talking of it. Even the president, as he entered, smiled patronizingly at him, and asked:\n\n\"Well, Jim, are you scared?\"\n\"No,\" said the messenger shortly.\n\n\"I thought we'd journeyed through the comet's tail once,\" broke in the junior clerk affably.\n\n\"Oh, that was Halley's,\" said the president; \"this is a new comet, quite a stranger, they say\u2014wonderful, wonderful! I saw it last night. Oh, by the way, Jim,\" turning again to the messenger, \"I want you to go down into the lower vaults today.\"\n\nThe messenger followed the president silently. Of course, they wanted him to go down to the lower vaults. It was too dangerous for more valuable men. He smiled grimly and listened.\n\n\"Everything of value has been moved out since the water began to seep in,\" said the president; \"but we miss two volumes of old records. Suppose you nose around down there,\u2014it isn't very pleasant, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Not very,\" said the messenger, as he walked out.\n\n\"Well, Jim, the tail of the new comet hits us at noon this time,\" said the vault clerk, as he passed over the keys; but the messenger passed silently down the stairs. Down he went beneath Broadway, where the dim light filtered through the feet of hurrying men; down to the dark basement beneath; down into the blackness and silence beneath that lowest cavern. Here with his dark lantern he groped in the bowels of the earth, under the world.\n\nHe drew a long breath as he threw back the last great iron door and stepped into the fetid slime within. Here at last was peace, and he groped moodily forward. A great rat leaped past him and cobwebs crept across his face. He felt carefully around the room, shelf by shelf, on the muddied floor, and in crevice and corner. Nothing. Then he went back to the far end, where somehow the wall felt different. He sounded and pushed and pried. Nothing. He started away. Then something brought him back. He was sounding and working again when suddenly the whole black wall swung as on mighty hinges, and blackness yawned beyond. He peered in; it was evidently a secret vault\u2014some hiding place of the old bank unknown in newer times. He entered hesitatingly. It was a long, narrow room with shelves, and at the far end, an old iron chest. On a high shelf lay the two missing volumes of records, and others. He put them carefully aside and stepped to the chest. It was old, strong, and rusty. He looked at the vast and old-fashioned lock and flashed his light on the hinges. They were deeply incrusted with rust. Looking about, he found a bit of iron and began to pry. The rust had eaten a hundred years, and it had gone deep. Slowly, wearily, the old lid lifted, and with a last, low groan lay bare its treasure\u2014and he saw the dull sheen of gold!\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nA low, grinding, reverberating crash struck upon his ear. He started up and looked about. All was black and still. He groped for his light and swung it about him. Then he knew! The great stone door had swung to. He forgot the gold and looked death squarely in the face. Then with a sigh he went methodically to work. The cold sweat stood on his forehead; but he searched, pounded, pushed, and worked until after what seemed endless hours his hand struck a cold bit of metal and the great door swung again harshly on its hinges, and then, striking against something soft and heavy, stopped. He had just room to squeeze through. There lay the body of the vault clerk, cold and stiff. He stared at it, and then felt sick and nauseated. The air seemed unaccountably foul, with a strong, peculiar odor. He stepped forward, clutched at the air, and fell fainting across the corpse.\n\nHe awoke with a sense of horror, leaped from the body, and groped up the stairs, calling to the guard. The watchman sat as if asleep, with the gate swinging free. With one glance at him the messenger hurried up to the sub-vault. In vain he called to the guards. His voice echoed and re-echoed weirdly. Up into the great basement he rushed. Here another guard lay prostrate on his face, cold and still. A fear arose in the messenger's heart. He dashed up to the cellar floor, up into the bank. The stillness of death lay everywhere and everywhere bowed, bent, and stretched the silent forms of men. The messenger paused and glanced about. He was not a man easily moved; but the sight was appalling! \"Robbery and murder,\" he whispered slowly to himself as he saw the twisted, oozing mouth of the president where he lay half-buried on his desk. Then a new thought seized him: If they found him here alone\u2014with all this money and all these dead men\u2014what would his life be worth? He glanced about, tiptoed cautiously to a side door, and again looked behind. Quietly he turned the latch and stepped out into Wall Street.\n\nHow silent the street was! Not a soul was stirring, and yet it was high-noon\u2014Wall Street? Broadway? He glanced almost wildly up and down, then across the street, and as he looked, a sickening horror froze in his limbs. With a choking cry of utter fright he lunged, leaned giddily against the cold building, and stared helplessly at the sight.\n\nIn the great stone doorway a hundred men and women and children lay crushed and twisted and jammed, forced into that great, gaping doorway like refuse in a can\u2014as if in one wild, frantic rush to safety, they had rushed and ground themselves to death. Slowly the messenger crept along the walls, wetting his parched mouth and trying to comprehend, stilling the tremor in his limbs and the rising terror in his heart. He met a business man, silk-hatted and frock-coated, who had crept, too, along that smooth wall and stood now stone dead with wonder written on his lips. The messenger turned his eyes hastily away and sought the curb. A woman leaned wearily against the signpost, her head bowed motionless on her lace and silken bosom. Before her stood a street car, silent, and within\u2014but the messenger but glanced and hurried on. A grimy newsboy sat in the gutter with the \"last edition\" in his uplifted hand: \"Danger!\" screamed its black headlines. \"Warnings wired around the world. The Comet's tail sweeps past us at noon. Deadly gases expected. Close doors and windows. Seek the cellar.\" The messenger read and staggered on. Far out from a window above, a girl lay with gasping face and sleevelets on her arms. On a store step sat a little, sweet-faced girl looking upward toward the skies, and in the carriage by her lay\u2014but the messenger looked no longer. The cords gave way\u2014the terror burst in his veins, and with one great, gasping cry he sprang desperately forward and ran,\u2014ran as only the frightened run, shrieking and fighting the air until with one last wail of pain he sank on the grass of Madison Square and lay prone and still.\nWhen he rose, he gave no glance at the still and silent forms on the benches, but, going to a fountain, bathed his face; then hiding himself in a corner away from the drama of death, he quietly gripped himself and thought the thing through: The comet had swept the earth and this was the end. Was everybody dead? He must search and see.\n\nHe knew that he must steady himself and keep calm, or he would go insane. First he must go to a restaurant. He walked up Fifth Avenue to a famous hostelry and entered its gorgeous, ghost-haunted halls. He beat back the nausea, and, seizing a tray from dead hands, hurried into the street and ate ravenously, hiding to keep out the sights.\n\n\"Yesterday, they would not have served me,\" he whispered, as he forced the food down.\n\nThen he started up the street,\u2014looking, peering, telephoning, ringing alarms; silent, silent all. Was nobody\u2014nobody\u2014he dared not think the thought and hurried on.\n\nSuddenly he stopped still. He had forgotten. My God! How could he have forgotten? He must rush to the subway\u2014then he almost laughed. No\u2014a car; if he could find a Ford. He saw one. Gently he lifted off its burden, and took his place on the seat. He tested the throttle. There was gas. He glided off, shivering, and drove up the street. Everywhere stood, leaned, lounged, and lay the dead, in grim and awful silence. On he ran past an automobile, wrecked and overturned; past another, filled with a gay party whose smiles yet lingered on their death-struck lips; on past crowds and groups of cars, pausing by dead policemen; at 42nd Street he had to detour to Park Avenue to avoid the dead congestion. He came back on Fifth Avenue at 57th and flew past the Plaza and by the park with its hushed babies and silent throng, until as he was rushing past 72nd Street he heard a sharp cry, and saw a living form leaning wildly out an upper window. He gasped. The human voice sounded in his ears like the voice of God.\n\n\"Hello\u2014hello\u2014help, in God's name!\" wailed the woman. \"There's a dead girl in here and a man and\u2014and see yonder dead men lying in the street and dead horses\u2014for the love of God go and bring the officers\u2014\u2014\" And the words trailed off into hysterical tears.\n\nHe wheeled the car in a sudden circle, running over the still body of a child and leaping on the curb. Then he rushed up the steps and tried the door and rang violently. There was a long pause, but at last the heavy door swung back. They stared a moment in silence. She had not noticed before that he was a Negro. He had not thought of her as white. She was a woman of perhaps twenty-five\u2014rarely beautiful and richly gowned, with darkly-golden hair, and jewels. Yesterday, he thought with bitterness, she would scarcely have looked at him twice. He would have been dirt beneath her silken feet. She stared at him. Of all the sorts of men she had pictured as coming to her rescue she had not dreamed of one like him. Not that he was not human, but he dwelt in a world so far from hers, so infinitely far, that he seldom even entered her thought. Yet as she looked at him curiously he seemed quite commonplace and usual. He was a tall, dark workingman of the better class, with a sensitive face trained to stolidity and a poor man's clothes and hands. His face was soft and slow and his manner at once cold and nervous, like fires long banked, but not out.\n\nSo a moment each paused and gauged the other; then the thought of the dead world without rushed in and they started toward each other.\n\n\"What has happened?\" she cried. \"Tell me! Nothing stirs. All is silence! I see the dead strewn before my window as winnowed by the breath of God,\u2014and see\u2014\u2014\" She dragged him through great, silken hangings to where, beneath the sheen of mahogany and silver, a little French maid lay stretched in quiet, everlasting sleep, and near her a butler lay prone in his livery.\n\nThe tears streamed down the woman's cheeks and she clung to his arm until the perfume of her breath swept his face and he felt the tremors racing through her body.\n\n\"I had been shut up in my dark room developing pictures of the comet which I took last night; when I came out\u2014I saw the dead!\n\n\"What has happened?\" she cried again.\n\nHe answered slowly:\n\"Something\u2014comet or devil\u2014swept across the earth this morning and\u2014many are dead!\"\n\n\"Many? Very many?\"\n\n\"I have searched and I have seen no other living soul but you.\"\n\nShe gasped and they stared at each other.\n\n\"My\u2014father!\" she whispered.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He started for the office.\"\n\n\"Where is it?\"\n\n\"In the Metropolitan Tower.\"\n\n\"Leave a note for him here and come.\"\n\nThen he stopped.\n\n\"No,\" he said firmly\u2014\"first, we must go\u2014to Harlem.\"\n\n\"Harlem!\" she cried. Then she understood. She tapped her foot at first impatiently. She looked back and shuddered. Then she came resolutely down the steps.\n\n\"There's a swifter car in the garage in the court,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't know how to drive it,\" he said.\n\n\"I do,\" she answered.\n\nIn ten minutes they were flying to Harlem on the wind. The Stutz rose and raced like an airplane. They took the turn at 110th Street on two wheels and slipped with a shriek into 135th.\n\nHe was gone but a moment. Then he returned, and his face was gray. She did not look, but said:\n\n\"You have lost\u2014somebody?\"\n\n\"I have lost\u2014everybody,\" he said, simply\u2014\"unless\u2014\u2014\"\n\nHe ran back and was gone several minutes\u2014hours they seemed to her.\n\n\"Everybody,\" he said, and he walked slowly back with something film-like in his hand which he stuffed into his pocket.\n\n\"I'm afraid I was selfish,\" he said. But already the car was moving toward the park among the dark and lined dead of Harlem\u2014the brown, still faces, the knotted hands, the homely garments, and the silence\u2014the wild and haunting silence. Out of the park, and down Fifth Avenue they whirled. In and out among the dead they slipped and quivered, needing no sound of bell or horn, until the great, square Metropolitan Tower hove in sight. Gently he laid the dead elevator boy aside; the car shot upward. The door of the office stood open. On the threshold lay the stenographer, and, staring at her, sat the dead clerk. The inner office was empty, but a note lay on the desk, folded and addressed but unsent:\n\nDear Daughter:\n\nI've gone for a hundred mile spin in Fred's new Mercedes. Shall not be back before dinner. I'll bring Fred with me.\n\nJ.B.H.\n\n\"Come,\" she cried nervously. \"We must search the city.\"\n\nUp and down, over and across, back again\u2014on went that ghostly search. Everywhere was silence and death\u2014death and silence! They hunted from Madison Square to Spuyten Duyvel; they rushed across the Williamsburg Bridge; they swept over Brooklyn; from the Battery and Morningside Heights they scanned the river. Silence, silence everywhere, and no human sign. Haggard and bedraggled they puffed a third time slowly down Broadway, under the broiling sun, and at last stopped. He sniffed the air. An odor\u2014a smell\u2014and with the shifting breeze a sickening stench filled their nostrils and brought its awful warning. The girl settled back helplessly in her seat.\n\n\"What can we do?\" she cried.\n\nIt was his turn now to take the lead, and he did it quickly.\n\n\"The long distance telephone\u2014the telegraph and the cable\u2014night rockets and then\u2014flight!\"\n\nShe looked at him now with strength and confidence. He did not look like men, as she had always pictured men; but he acted like one and she was content. In fifteen minutes they were at the central telephone exchange. As they came to the door he stepped quickly before her and pressed her gently back as he closed it. She heard him moving to and fro, and knew his burdens\u2014the poor, little burdens he bore. When she entered, he was alone in the room. The grim switchboard flashed its metallic face in cryptic, sphinx-like immobility. She seated herself on a stool and donned the bright earpiece. She looked at the mouthpiece. She had never looked at one so closely before. It was wide and black, pimpled with usage; inert; dead; almost sarcastic in its unfeeling curves. It looked\u2014she beat back the thought\u2014but it looked,\u2014it persisted in looking like\u2014she turned her head and found herself alone. One moment she was terrified; then she thanked him silently for his delicacy and turned resolutely, with a quick intaking of breath.\n\n\"Hello!\" she called in low tones. She was calling to the world. The world must answer. Would the world answer? Was the world\u2014\u2014\n\nSilence!\n\nShe had spoken too low.\n\n\"Hello!\" she cried, full-voiced.\n\nShe listened. Silence! Her heart beat quickly. She cried in clear, distinct, loud tones: \"Hello\u2014hello\u2014hello!\"\n\nWhat was that whirring? Surely\u2014no\u2014was it the click of a receiver?\n\nShe bent close, she moved the pegs in the holes, and called and called, until her voice rose almost to a shriek, and her heart hammered. It was as if she had heard the last flicker of creation, and the evil was silence. Her voice dropped to a sob. She sat stupidly staring into the black and sarcastic mouthpiece, and the thought came again. Hope lay dead within her. Yes, the cable and the rockets remained; but the world\u2014she could not frame the thought or say the word. It was too mighty\u2014too terrible! She turned toward the door with a new fear in her heart. For the first time she seemed to realize that she was alone in the world with a stranger, with something more than a stranger,\u2014with a man alien in blood and culture\u2014unknown, perhaps unknowable. It was awful! She must escape\u2014she must fly; he must not see her again. Who knew what awful thoughts\u2014\n\nShe gathered her silken skirts deftly about her young, smooth limbs\u2014listened, and glided into a sidehall. A moment she shrank back: the hall lay filled with dead women; then she leaped to the door and tore at it, with bleeding fingers, until it swung wide. She looked out. He was standing at the top of the alley,\u2014silhouetted, tall and black, motionless. Was he looking at her or away? She did not know\u2014she did not care. She simply leaped and ran\u2014ran until she found herself alone amid the dead and the tall ramparts of towering buildings.\n\nShe stopped. She was alone. Alone! Alone on the streets\u2014alone in the city\u2014perhaps alone in the world! There crept in upon her the sense of deception\u2014of creeping hands behind her back\u2014of silent, moving things she could not see,\u2014of voices hushed in fearsome conspiracy. She looked behind and sideways, started at strange sounds and heard still stranger, until every nerve within her stood sharp and quivering, stretched to scream at the barest touch. She whirled and flew back, whimpering like a child, until she found that narrow alley again and the dark, silent figure silhouetted at the top. She stopped and rested; then she walked silently toward him, looked at him timidly; but he said nothing as he handed her into the car. Her voice caught as she whispered:\n\n\"Not\u2014that.\"\n\nAnd he answered slowly: \"No\u2014not that!\"\n\nThey climbed into the car. She bent forward on the wheel and sobbed, with great, dry, quivering sobs, as they flew toward the cable office on the east side, leaving the world of wealth and prosperity for the world of poverty and work. In the world behind them were death and silence, grave and grim, almost cynical, but always decent; here it was hideous. It clothed itself in every ghastly form of terror, struggle, hate, and suffering. It lay wreathed in crime and squalor, greed and lust. Only in its dread and awful silence was it like to death everywhere.\n\nYet as the two, flying and alone, looked upon the horror of the world, slowly, gradually, the sense of all-enveloping death deserted them. They seemed to move in a world silent and asleep,\u2014not dead. They moved in quiet reverence, lest somehow they wake these sleeping forms who had, at last, found peace. They moved in some solemn, world-wide Friedhof, above which some mighty arm had waved its magic wand. All nature slept until\u2014until, and quick with the same startling thought, they looked into each other's eyes\u2014he, ashen, and she, crimson, with unspoken thought. To both, the vision of a mighty beauty\u2014of vast, unspoken things, swelled in their souls; but they put it away.\n\nGreat, dark coils of wire came up from the earth and down from the sun and entered this low lair of witchery. The gathered lightnings of the world centered here, binding with beams of light the ends of the earth. The doors gaped on the gloom within. He paused on the threshold.\n\n\"Do you know the code?\" she asked.\n\n\"I know the call for help\u2014we used it formerly at the bank.\"\n\nShe hardly heard. She heard the lapping of the waters far below,\u2014the dark and restless waters\u2014the cold and luring waters, as they called. He stepped within. Slowly she walked to the wall, where the water called below, and stood and waited. Long she waited, and he did not come. Then with a start she saw him, too, standing beside the black waters. Slowly he removed his coat and stood there silently. She walked quickly to him and laid her hand on his arm. He did not start or look. The waters lapped on in luring, deadly rhythm. He pointed down to the waters, and said quietly:\n\n\"The world lies beneath the waters now\u2014may I go?\"\n\nShe looked into his stricken, tired face, and a great pity surged within her heart. She answered in a voice clear and calm, \"No.\"\n\nUpward they turned toward life again, and he seized the wheel. The world was darkening to twilight, and a great, gray pall was falling mercifully and gently on the sleeping dead. The ghastly glare of reality seemed replaced with the dream of some vast romance. The girl lay silently back, as the motor whizzed along, and looked half-consciously for the elf-queen to wave life into this dead world again. She forgot to wonder at the quickness with which he had learned to drive her car. It seemed natural. And then as they whirled and swung into Madison Square and at the door of the Metropolitan Tower she gave a low cry, and her eyes were great! Perhaps she had seen the elf-queen?\n\nThe man led her to the elevator of the tower and deftly they ascended. In her father's office they gathered rugs and chairs, and he wrote a note and laid it on the desk; then they ascended to the roof and he made her comfortable. For a while she rested and sank to dreamy somnolence, watching the worlds above and wondering. Below lay the dark shadows of the city and afar was the shining of the sea. She glanced at him timidly as he set food before her and took a shawl and wound her in it, touching her reverently, yet tenderly. She looked up at him with thankfulness in her eyes, eating what he served. He watched the city. She watched him. He seemed very human,\u2014very near now.\n\n\"Have you had to work hard?\" she asked softly.\n\n\"Always,\" he said.\n\n\"I have always been idle,\" she said. \"I was rich.\"\n\n\"I was poor,\" he almost echoed.\n\n\"The rich and the poor are met together,\" she began, and he finished:\n\n\"The Lord is the Maker of them all.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said slowly; \"and how foolish our human distinctions seem\u2014now,\" looking down to the great dead city stretched below, swimming in unlightened shadows.\n\n\"Yes\u2014I was not\u2014human, yesterday,\" he said.\n\nShe looked at him. \"And your people were not my people,\" she said; \"but today\u2014\u2014\" She paused. He was a man,\u2014no more; but he was in some larger sense a gentleman,\u2014sensitive, kindly, chivalrous, everything save his hands and\u2014his face. Yet yesterday\u2014\u2014\n\n\"Death, the leveler!\" he muttered.\n\n\"And the revealer,\" she whispered gently, rising to her feet with great eyes. He turned away, and after fumbling a moment sent a rocket into the darkening air. It arose, shrieked, and flew up, a slim path of light, and scattering its stars abroad, dropped on the city below. She scarcely noticed it. A vision of the world had risen before her. Slowly the mighty prophecy of her destiny overwhelmed her. Above the dead past hovered the Angel of Annunciation. She was no mere woman. She was neither high nor low, white nor black, rich nor poor. She was primal woman; mighty mother of all men to come and Bride of Life. She looked upon the man beside her and forgot all else but his manhood, his strong, vigorous manhood\u2014his sorrow and sacrifice. She saw him glorified. He was no longer a thing apart, a creature below, a strange outcast of another clime and blood, but her Brother Humanity incarnate, Son of God and great All-Father of the race to be.\n\nHe did not glimpse the glory in her eyes, but stood looking outward toward the sea and sending rocket after rocket into the unanswering darkness. Dark-purple clouds lay banked and billowed in the west. Behind them and all around, the heavens glowed in dim, weird radiance that suffused the darkening world and made almost a minor music. Suddenly, as though gathered back in some vast hand, the great cloud-curtain fell away. Low on the horizon lay a long, white star\u2014mystic, wonderful! And from it fled upward to the pole, like some wan bridal veil, a pale, wide sheet of flame that lighted all the world and dimmed the stars.\n\nIn fascinated silence the man gazed at the heavens and dropped his rockets to the floor. Memories of memories stirred to life in the dead recesses of his mind. The shackles seemed to rattle and fall from his soul. Up from the crass and crushing and cringing of his caste leaped the lone majesty of kings long dead. He arose within the shadows, tall, straight, and stern, with power in his eyes and ghostly scepters hovering to his grasp. It was as though some mighty Pharaoh lived again, or curled Assyrian lord. He turned and looked upon the lady, and found her gazing straight at him.\n\nSilently, immovably, they saw each other face to face\u2014eye to eye. Their souls lay naked to the night. It was not lust; it was not love\u2014it was some vaster, mightier thing that needed neither touch of body nor thrill of soul. It was a thought divine, splendid.\n\nSlowly, noiselessly, they moved toward each other\u2014the heavens above, the seas around, the city grim and dead below. He loomed from out the velvet shadows vast and dark. Pearl-white and slender, she shone beneath the stars. She stretched her jeweled hands abroad. He lifted up his mighty arms, and they cried each to the other, almost with one voice, \"The world is dead.\"\n\n\"Long live the\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Honk! Honk!\" Hoarse and sharp the cry of a motor drifted clearly up from the silence below. They started backward with a cry and gazed upon each other with eyes that faltered and fell, with blood that boiled.\n\n\"Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk!\" came the mad cry again, and almost from their feet a rocket blazed into the air and scattered its stars upon them. She covered her eyes with her hands, and her shoulders heaved. He dropped and bowed, groped blindly on his knees about the floor. A blue flame spluttered lazily after an age, and she heard the scream of an answering rocket as it flew.\n\nThen they stood still as death, looking to opposite ends of the earth.\n\n\"Clang\u2014crash\u2014clang!\"\n\nThe roar and ring of swift elevators shooting upward from below made the great tower tremble. A murmur and babel of voices swept in upon the night. All over the once dead city the lights blinked, flickered, and flamed; and then with a sudden clanging of doors the entrance to the platform was filled with men, and one with white and flying hair rushed to the girl and lifted her to his breast. \"My daughter!\" he sobbed.\n\nBehind him hurried a younger, comelier man, carefully clad in motor costume, who bent above the girl with passionate solicitude and gazed into her staring eyes until they narrowed and dropped and her face flushed deeper and deeper crimson.\n\n\"Julia,\" he whispered; \"my darling, I thought you were gone forever.\"\n\nShe looked up at him with strange, searching eyes.\n\n\"Fred,\" she murmured, almost vaguely, \"is the world\u2014gone?\"\n\n\"Only New York,\" he answered; \"it is terrible\u2014awful! You know,\u2014but you, how did you escape\u2014how have you endured this horror? Are you well? Unharmed?\"\n\n\"Unharmed!\" she said.\n\n\"And this man here?\" he asked, encircling her drooping form with one arm and turning toward the Negro. Suddenly he stiffened and his hand flew to his hip. \"Why!\" he snarled. \"It's\u2014a\u2014nigger\u2014Julia! Has he\u2014has he dared\u2014\u2014\"\n\nShe lifted her head and looked at her late companion curiously and then dropped her eyes with a sigh.\n\n\"He has dared\u2014all, to rescue me,\" she said quietly, \"and I\u2014thank him\u2014much.\" But she did not look at him again. As the couple turned away, the father drew a roll of bills from his pockets.\n\n\"Here, my good fellow,\" he said, thrusting the money into the man's hands, \"take that,\u2014what's your name?\"\n\n\"Jim Davis,\" came the answer, hollow-voiced.\n\n\"Well, Jim, I thank you. I've always liked your people. If you ever want a job, call on me.\" And they were gone.\n\nThe crowd poured up and out of the elevators, talking and whispering.\n\n\"Who was it?\"\n\n\"Are they alive?\"\n\n\"How many?\"\n\n\"Two!\"\n\n\"Who was saved?\"\n\n\"A white girl and a nigger\u2014there she goes.\"\n\n\"A nigger? Where is he? Let's lynch the damned\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Shut up\u2014he's all right-he saved her.\"\n\n\"Saved hell! He had no business\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Here he comes.\"\n\nInto the glare of the electric lights the colored man moved slowly, with the eyes of those that walk and sleep.\n\n\"Well, what do you think of that?\" cried a bystander; \"of all New York, just a white girl and a nigger!\"\n\nThe colored man heard nothing. He stood silently beneath the glare of the light, gazing at the money in his hand and shrinking as he gazed; slowly he put his other hand into his pocket and brought out a baby's filmy cap, and gazed again. A woman mounted to the platform and looked about, shading her eyes. She was brown, small, and toil-worn, and in one arm lay the corpse of a dark baby. The crowd parted and her eyes fell on the colored man; with a cry she tottered toward him.\n\n\"Jim!\"\n\nHe whirled and, with a sob of joy, caught her in his arms.\n\nA Hymn to the Peoples\n\nO Truce of God!\nAnd primal meeting of the Sons of Man,\nForeshadowing the union of the World!\nFrom all the ends of earth we come!\nOld Night, the elder sister of the Day,\nMother of Dawn in the golden East,\nMeets in the misty twilight with her brood,\nPale and black, tawny, red and brown,\nThe mighty human rainbow of the world,\nSpanning its wilderness of storm.\n\nSoftly in sympathy the sunlight falls,\nRare is the radiance of the moon;\nAnd on the darkest midnight blaze the stars\u2014\nThe far-flown shadows of whose brilliance\nDrop like a dream on the dim shores of Time,\nForecasting Days that are to these\nAs day to night.\n\nSo sit we all as one.\nSo, gloomed in tall and stone-swathed groves,\nThe Buddha walks with Christ!\nAnd Al-Koran and Bible both be holy!\nAlmighty Word!\nIn this Thine awful sanctuary,\nFirst and flame-haunted City of the Widened World,\nAssoil us, Lord of Lands and Seas!\nWe are but weak and wayward men,\nDistraught alike with hatred and vainglory;\n\nProne to despise the Soul that breathes within\u2014\nHigh visioned hordes that lie and steal and kill,\nSinning the sin each separate heart disclaims,\nClambering upon our riven, writhing selves,\nBesieging Heaven by trampling men to Hell!\nWe be blood-guilty! Lo, our hands be red!\nNot one may blame the other in this sin!\nBut here\u2014here in the white Silence of the Dawn,\nBefore the Womb of Time,\nWith bowed hearts all flame and shame,\nWe face the birth-pangs of a world:\n\nWe hear the stifled cry of Nations all but born\u2014\nThe wail of women ravished of their stunted brood!\nWe see the nakedness of Toil, the poverty of Wealth,\nWe know the Anarchy of Empire, and doleful Death of Life!\nAnd hearing, seeing, knowing all, we cry:\n\nSave us, World-Spirit, from our lesser selves!\nGrant us that war and hatred cease,\nReveal our souls in every race and hue!\nHelp us, O Human God, in this Thy Truce,\nTo make Humanity divine!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/666668", "artist_names": "Mary Chapin

"Tell Me Where It Hurts Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWhy is that sad look in your eyes?\nWhy are you crying?\nTell me now, tell me now\nTell me why you're feeling this way\nI hate to see you so down\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, baby, is it your heart\nOoh, breaking all in pieces\nMaking you cry\nMaking you feel blue\nIs there anything that I can do?\n[Chorus]\nWhy don't you\nTell me where it hurts now, baby\nAnd I'll do my best to make it better\nYes, I'll do my best to make\nThe tears all go away\nJust tell me where it hurts now, tell me\nAnd I'll love you with a love so tender\nAnd if you'll let me stay\nI'll love all the hurt away\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhere are all those tears coming from?\nWhy are they falling?\nDid somebody, somebody\nSomebody leave your heart in the cold?\nYou just need somebody to hold\nSo baby, give me a chance\nTo put back all the pieces\nTake your broken heart\nAnd make it just like new\nThere's so many things that I can do\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy don't you tell me where it hurts now, baby\nAnd I'll do my best to make it better\nYes, I'll do my best to make\nThe tears all go away\nJust tell me where it hurts now, tell me\nAnd I'll love you with a love so tender\nOh, and if you'll let me stay\nI'll love all the hurt away\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nOoh, I can make it go away, baby\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIs it your heart\nOoh, breaking all in pieces\nMaking
