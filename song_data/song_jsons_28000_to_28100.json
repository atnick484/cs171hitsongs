you\nI'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths\nI seen eyes wide as they're about to shoot\nYou can be a hairpin, off and you can trigger your roots\nI wave to these haters, don't give me dap\nYou know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh\nY'all body language is all remedial\nHow could you see the difference between you and I?\nMy crash course was much tougher\nRound friends who kill they friends\nThen hug their friends' mothers\nAnd show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares\nInvisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there\nMemories may sneak down my cheek\nBut I could see a side-eye in my sleep\n\n[Chorus: Frank Ocean & JAY-Z]\nReady for it, deep breath, fill up the void\nEyes, open them up, check off the coins\nStill stingin' from tears, they

bought it but I just rent it\nGot a brand new big old chain\nGot so much sauce I don't need no pendant\nPaintin' pictures when I be spendin'\nI'm poppin' flo-rhythym on all these women\nIt's my birthday, just turned 20\nAnd I just went to go see the dentist\nPut some stones all in my gold\nKnow you niggas thought I was gone\nKnow you niggas thought I wasn't comin' home\nBut guess what, bitch I'm home\nOn probation, but I still keep that chrome\nCrack a nigga dome\n(On probation but I still keep that chrome\nI'll crack a nigga dome)\nTraded my AR for a sniper, traded my Draco for a TEC\nTraded my Rollie for a AP but I coulda got a Patek\nAnd I coulda got a Corvette, and I coulda got me a jet\nAnd I coulda got me some sex, but I only got me some neck\nTraded my ex bitch for a check\nI'm takin' codeine with the x\nI wanna buy my brother the world\nBut since I can't, I'ma get him a Lex\nAyy ayy, I'm a Israelite my diamonds is real ice\nI had to sacrifice to be here, that's how I'm with you tonight\nI had to run down with my big Glock 9 to feed my appetite\nI had to go through hard times and dark times for me to see the light\nAy, I remember pourin' honey on my rice\nAy, I remember havin' no money, I was livin' in shacks\nAy, you got me fucked up if I'ma go out without a fight\nAy, this my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight\n[Outro]\nLive it up tonight\nThis my

1]\nBoy, you're gonna know it all\nYou'll think you're ten feet tall\nAnd run like you're bulletproof\nAnd total a car or two\nBoy, you're gonna hate this town\nWish you could burn it down\nThat fire in your eyes is 20 counties wide\nBut boy, you're gonna love 17\nAnd boy, you'll do some stupid things\n[Chorus]\nYou're gonna drive and kiss\nAnd throw a punch\nAnd grow up way too fast\nYou're gonna drop the ball\nHit the wall\nAnd break some hearts like glass\nI know you well, 'cause you're a part of me\nAnd a part of you will always be a boy\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're gonna be so stubborn\nYou get that from your mother\nI already see it now, you weren't built for backing down\nAnd boy, there'll be a small town night\nAnd you'll fall for her sky-blue eyes\nAnd when she's in your hands\nYou'll think you're a man and not a boy\nShe'll make you lose your mind, boy\nShe'll be every reason why\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're gonna drive and kiss\nAnd throw a punch\nAnd grow up way too fast\nYou're gonna drop the ball\nHit the wall\nAnd break some hearts like glass\nI know you will, 'cause you're a part of me\nAnd a part of you will always be...my boy\nSee Lee Brice LiveGet tickets as low as $23You might also like[Bridge]\nIt's 3am and I'd do anything to get you back to sleep\nAnd that face will be the same one in the rearview\nThe day I watch you leave\n\n[Outro]\nBut boy, you're gonna come back home\nYou're gonna settle down\nBut you won't feel the way I'm feelin' now\nTil you have a boy\nHe's gonna know it all\nHe'll think he's ten feet tall\nAnd run like he's bulletproof\nAnd total a

quarrels\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'll paint the picture, let me set the scene\nI know when I have children they will know what it means\nAnd I pass on these things my family's given to me\nJust love, and understanding positivity\n[Chorus]\nWe could change this whole world with a piano\nAdd a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go\nI'm just a boy with a one-man show\nNo university, no degree, but lord knows\nEverybody's talking 'bout exponential growth\nAnd the stock market crashing and their portfolios\nWhile I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote\nSing, love could change the world in a moment\nBut what do I know?\nLove can change the world in a moment\nBut what do I know?\nLove can change the world in a moment\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe revolution's coming, it's a minute away\nI saw people marching in the streets today\nYou know we are made up of love and hate\nBut both of them are balanced on a razor blade\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'll paint the picture, let me set the scene\nI know, I'm all for people following their dreams\nJust re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans\nIt's love and understanding positivity\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWe could change this whole world with a piano\nAdd a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go\nI'm just a boy with a one-man show\nNo university, no degree, but lord knows\nEverybody's talking 'bout exponential growth\nAnd the stock market crashing and their portfolios\nWhile I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote\nSing, love could change the world in a moment\nBut what do I know?\nLove can change the world in a moment\nBut what do I know?\nLove can change the world in a moment\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'll paint the picture, let me set the scene\nYou know, the future's in the hands of you and me\nSo let's all get together, we can all be free\nSpread love and understanding, positivity\n\n[Chorus]\nWe could change this whole world with a piano\nAdd a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go\nI'm just a boy with a one-man show\nNo university, no degree, but lord knows\nEverybody's talking 'bout exponential growth\nAnd the stock market crashing and their portfolios\nWhile I'll be sitting here with a song

nine\nI forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride\nThe paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind\nSo blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life\nFriends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride\nAnd when the world's against me is when I really come alive\nAnd every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride\nYou know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs\nI think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun\nI need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up\nInstead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become\nGuess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me\nWithout a nine-to-five job or a uni degree\nTo be caught up in the trappings of the industry\nShow me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key\nAnd you'll see\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more\n\n[Chorus]\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\n\n[Verse 2]\nI used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs\nI chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\nI think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell\nRelationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well\nAnd ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps\nBecause you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun\nPlease know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run\nI beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become\nConversations with my father on the A14\nAge 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams\nNow I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me\nWith my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans\nWembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'\nI may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud\nAnd to the next generation, inspiration's allowed\nThe world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now\nSomehow\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more\n\n[Chorus]\nAnother one to take the sting away\nOh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\n\n[Bridge]\nWelcome to the new show\nI guess you know I've been away\nBut where I'm heading, who knows?\nBut my heart will stay the same\nWelcome to the new show\nI guess you know I've been away\nBut where I'm heading, who knows?\nMy pain eraser\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain

get what's inside outside\nSo many people wanna see my insides outside\nI'm from that city four hours east of Southside\nWhere everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders\nGoing up, with the ones I hold it down with\nWhole city got my back on some photobomb shit\nWhole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit\nBefore this, I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with\n[Refrain: Big Sean]\nYou know, take the fame, take the crib, take our cars\nNow we gotta take the train, hood niggas takin' chains\nSlavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot\nAnd young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away\nThe light\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih & Big Sean]\nNo matter how much they gon' shade you\nNo, man they can't fuck with the light\nThey can't stop the shine\nThey can't fuck with the light\nHell nah, the boy's that bright\nEven if you take away my life, you can't take the light\nNo matter how much they gon' shade you\n\n[Verse 2: Big Sean]\nGot the whole city on fire\nBoy, this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired\nThis the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire\nThis the flow that got my whole family finna retire\nFlows on flows, I might drown in this bitch\nYe found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch\nMy dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town\nWhere if they know you're brown, they might hold you down and even hose you down, man\nSince I'm his son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard\nI took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card\nAnd realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings\nAnd a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon\nYou might also like[Refrain: Big Sean]\nSo when they take the fame, take the crib, take our cars\nNow we gotta take the train, and hood niggas takin' chains\nSlavemaster take our

a shit\nI never used to talk, I never used to talk like this\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm sorry I named the album Montevallo\nAnd I'm sorry people know your name now\nAnd strangers hit you up on social media\nI'm sorry you can't listen to the radio\nAnd drive out to the place we used to get peaches down in Pelham\nI know you want your privacy\nAnd you got nothing to say to me\nBut I wish you'd let me pay off your student loans\nWith these songs you gave to me\n'Member the first time you stayed with me?\nOverpacked, and drove up, and went to the CMAs with me?\nTwo years later, it felt like you were a million miles away from me\nAnd I was the one on stage, drunk, barely holdin' on on ABC\nHope your dad still prays for me\n[Chorus]\nDrinkin' too much, drinkin' too much\nSince you been gone, I can't get gone enough\nI'm on top of the world, goin' down\nI'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around\nDrinkin' too much, drinkin' too much\nSince you been gone, I can't get gone enough\nI'm on top of the world, I'm goin' down\nI'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around\n\n[Verse 2]\nA year ago, I was in a hotel room in Phoenix\nWonderin' if it's ever okay to lie\n'Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die\nBut I told you everything, and you told me to have a good life\nBut you still couldn't believe it was really goodbye\nEvery night, you'd fill the bathtub up\nLie there for hours, put your face under water and cry\nI never wanted to be a heartbreaker\nTurn your sisters and their friends into matchmakers\nI know you think my dreams came true\nSince you been gone, singin' these songs are just something to do\nThe only dream I ever had was you\nI hope you know I'm still in love\nIt's the kind that you can't fall out of\nSee Sam Hunt LiveGet tickets as low as $81You might also

drinkin' too much\nSince you been gone, I can't get gone enough\nI'm on top of the world, I'm goin' down\nI'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around\n(Now it's almost gone)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know this might seem like a contradiction\nAnd the last thing you need is more unwanted attention\nBut you changed your number and moved\nAnd this is the only way I could reach you\nSo wherever you are, turn it up and listen\n\n[Outro]\nHannah Lee, I'm on my way to you\nNobody can love you like I do\nI don't know what I'm gon' say to you\nBut I know there ain't no way, know there ain't no way\nKnow there

Cole]\nHey, niggas be dying on the daily\nIt seems my dreams faded for far too long\nThe consequences deadly\nCan't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal\nControl the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal\n'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off\nFull of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause\nAin't no coming back, family dressed in black\nPlus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack\nAnd my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me\nLike I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet\nLike I ain't out in the field like that\nI might be low for the moment but I will bounce back\nDespite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless\nScreaming, \"Fuck the law,\" my life is lawless\nThat's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic\nTo see this is like the farthest thing from heaven\nThis is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic\nI try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets\nBut these felonies be making life the hardest\nResisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet\nOr run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it\nThat's why I write this sonnet\nIf the pressure get too much for me to take and I break\nPlay this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it\n(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it\n(For your eyes) For your eyes only\n[Chorus: J.

Cole]\nYou probably grown now so this song'll hit you\nIf you hearing this, unfortunately means\nThat I'm no longer with you in the physical\nNot even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive\nHe got me praying that the spiritual is real\nSo I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too\nSo I know how part of you feels\nMaybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me\nLife goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me\nI hope not, I'm tired of dope spots\nAnd fiends that smoke rocks\nI've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot\nI'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance\nNow I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance\nDon't know if I ever had a chance\nAt a glance, I'm a failure\nAddicted to pushing paraphernalia\nBut Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once\nInnocence disappeared by the age of eight years\nMy Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted\nSo Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging\nBlood was staining the concrete\nOlder niggas I loved talked like they was above\nMaintaining a timesheet, that's slow money\nPicked up the family business by the age of 13\nSix years later was handed sentence\n'Round the same time is when you came in this world\nMe and your mama thinking:\n\"What the fuck we naming this girl?\"\nI told her \"Nina,\" the prettiest name that I could think of\nFor the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19\nTook me two felonies to see the trap\nThis crooked-ass system set for me\nAnd now I fear it's too late for me to ever be\nThe one that set examples that was never set for me\nI'm living fast, but not fast enough\n'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me\nAnd if my past becomes the death of me\nI hope you understand\nYou might also like[Chorus: J.

Cole]\nIt's several ways I could've went out, too many to count\nWas it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?\nWas it the young niggas, blasting frustrated\n'Cause the cash running out?\nNiggas don't know how to act in a drought\nSee, baby girl, I realized\nMy definition of a real nigga was skewed\nMy views misshaped by new mixtapes\nThat confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true\nThat real niggas don't speak when they beef with you\nThey just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo\nAnd if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food\nI was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops\nDucking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you\nI pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views\nMuch broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you\nInto a box, where your son don't even know his pops\nAnd the cyclical nature of doing time continues\nMy worst fear is one day that you come home from school\nAnd see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news\nI got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon\nAnd sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true\nBut maybe there's a chance that it's not\nAnd this album remains locked\nIn a hard drive like valuable jewels\nAnd I can teach you this in person\nLike I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes\nI love you and I hope to God I don't lose you\nFor your eyes only\n[Chorus: CharGaux & J. Cole]\nFor your eyes, for your eyes only\nFor your eyes, for your eyes only\nFor your eyes, do you understand?\nFor your eyes only\n\n[Verse 4: J. Cole]\nOne day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling\nWhat he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling\nI tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing\nBut I could feel the sense of panic in his voice\nAnd it was chilling, he said:\n\"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children\nI never asked for nothing, when times was hard\nI never had discussions with you, begging you to help me\nI dealt with the repercussions of my actions\nI know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit\nBut that shit was in my blood, you know my life\nI know your momma, nigga, send my love\nIn case I never get a chance to speak again\nI won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib\nThat's the way I wished my family lived\nBut my granny crib was in the 'jects\"\nI had to interject like:\n\"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?\"\nHe said, \"Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions\nBut I been having premonitions\nJust call it visions from the other side\nI got a feeling I won't see tomorrow\nLike the time I'm living on is borrowed\nWith that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father\nWrite my story down, and if I pass\nGo play it for my daughter when she ready\"\nAnd so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only\nDon't you ever scratch or disrespect it\nThis perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son\nI dedicate these words to you and all the other children\nAffected by the mass incarceration in this nation\nThat sent your pops to prison when he needed education\nSometimes I think that segregation would've done us better\nAlthough I know that means that I would never\nBe brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled\nWhen he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro\nWith lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old\nNow it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told\nGirl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold\nNot because he was the first to get some pussy 12 years old\nNot because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues\nNot because he went from bagging up them grams to serving O's\nNah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard\nNot because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars\nNot because he screamed, \"Fuck the law\"\nAlthough that was true\nYour daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you\nFor your eyes only227Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 10, "api_path": "/songs/2925378", "artist_names": "J.

Scott Momaday", "lyrics": "The Way to Rainy Mountain LyricsA single knoll rises out of the plain in Oklahoma, north and west of the Wichita Range. For my people, the Kiowas, it is an old landmark, and they gave it the name Rainy Mountain. The hardest weather in the world is there. Winter brings blizzards, hot tornadic winds arise in the spring, and in summer the prairie is an anvil's edge. The grass turns brittle and brown, and it cracks beneath your feet. There are green belts along the rivers and creeks, linear groves of hickory and pecan, willow and witch hazel. At a distance in July or August the steaming foliage seems almost to writhe in fire. Great green and yellow grasshoppers are everywhere in the tall grass, popping up like corn to sting the flesh, and tortoises crawl about on the red earth, going nowhere in the plenty of time.\n\nLoneliness is an aspect of the land. All things in the plain are isolate; there is no confusion of objects in the eye, but one hill or one tree or one man. To look upon that landscape in the early morning, with the sun at your back, is to lose the sense of proportion. Your imagination comes to life, and this, you think, is where Creation was begun.\n\nI returned to Rainy Mountain in July. My grandmother had died in the spring, and I wanted to be at her grave. She had lived to be very old and at last infirm. Her only living daughter was with her when she died, and I was told that in death her face was that of a child.\n\nI like to think of her as a child. When she was born, the Kiowas were living the last great moment of their history. For more than a hundred years they had controlled the open range from the Smoky Hill River to the Red, from the headwaters of the Canadian to the fork of the Arkansas and Cimarron. In alliance with the Comanches, they had ruled the whole of the southern Plains. War was their sacred business, and they were among the finest horsemen the world has ever known. But warfare for the Kiowas was preeminently a matter of disposition rather than of survival, and they never understood the grim, unrelenting advance of the U.S. Cavalry. When at last, divided and ill provisioned, they were driven onto the Staked Plains in the cold rains of autumn, they fell into panic. In Palo Duro Canyon they abandoned their crucial stores to pillage and had nothing then but their lives. In order to save themselves, they surrendered to the soldiers at Fort Sill and were imprisoned in the old stone corral that now stands as a military museum. My grandmother was spared the humiliation of those high gray walls by eight or ten years, but she must have known from birth the affliction of defeat, the dark brooding of old warriors.\n\nHer name was Aho, and she belonged to the last culture to evolve in North America. Her forebears came down from the high country in western Montana nearly three centuries ago. They were a mountain people, a mysterious tribe of hunters whose language has never been positively classified in any major group. In the late seventeenth century they began a long migration to the south and east. It was a journey toward the dawn, and it led to a golden age. Along the way the Kiowas were befriended by the Crows, who gave them the culture and religion of the Plains. They acquired horses, and their ancient nomadic spirit was suddenly free of the ground. They acquired Tai-me, the sacred Sun Dance doll, from that moment the object and symbol of their worship, and so shared in the divinity of the sun. Not least, they acquired the sense of destiny, therefore courage and pride. When they entered upon the southern Plains they had been transformed. No longer were they slaves to the simple necessity of survival; they were a lordly and dangerous society of fighters and thieves, hunters and priests of the sun. According to their origin myth, they entered the world through a hollow log. From one point of view, their migration was the fruit of an old prophecy, for indeed they emerged from a sunless world.\n\nAlthough my grandmother lived out her long life in the shadow of Rainy Mountain, the immense landscape of the continental interior lay like memory in her blood. She could tell of the Crows, whom she had never seen, and of the Black Hills, where she had never been. I wanted to see in reality what she had seen more perfectly in the mind's eye, and traveled fifteen hundred miles to begin my pilgrimage.\nYellowstone, it seemed to me, was the top of the world, a region of deep lakes and dark timber, canyons and waterfalls. But, beautiful as it is, one might have the sense of confinement there. The skyline in all directions is close at hand, the high wall of the woods and deep cleavages of shade. There is a perfect freedom in the mountains, but it belongs to the eagle and the elk, the badger and the bear. The Kiowas reckoned their stature by the distance they could see, and they were bent and blind in the wilderness.\n\nDescending eastward, the highland meadows are a stairway to the plain. In July the inland slope of the Rockies is luxuriant with flax and buckwheat, stonecrop and larkspur. The earth unfolds and the limit of the land recedes. Clusters of trees, and animals grazing far in the distance, cause the vision to reach away and wonder to build upon the mind. The sun follows a longer course in the day, and the sky is immense beyond all comparison. The great billowing clouds that sail upon it are shadows that move upon the grain like water, dividing light. Farther down, in the land of the Crows and Blackfeet, the plain is yellow. Sweet clover takes hold of the hills and bends upon itself to cover and seal the soil. There the Kiowas paused on their way; they had come to the place where they must change their lives. The sun is at home on the plains. Precisely there does it have the certain character of a god. When the Kiowas came to the land of the Crows, they could see the darklees of the hills at dawn across the Bighorn River, the profusion of light on the grain shelves, the oldest deity ranging after the solstices. Not yet would they veer southward to the caldron of the land that lay below; they must wean their blood from the northern winter and hold the mountains a while longer in their view. They bore Tai-me in procession to the east.\n\nA dark mist lay over the Black Hills, and the land was like iron. At the top of a ridge I caught sight of Devil's Tower upthrust against the gray sky as if in the birth of time the core of the earth had broken through its crust and the motion of the world was begun. There are things in nature that engender an awful quiet in the heart of man; Devil's Tower is one of them. Two centuries ago, because they could not do otherwise, the Kiowas made a legend at the base of the rock. My grandmother said: Eight children were there at play, seven sisters and their brother. Suddenly the boy was struck dumb; he trembled and began to run upon his hands and feet. His fingers became claws, and his body was covered with fur. Directly there was a bear where the boy had been. The sisters were terrified; they ran, and the bear after them. They came to the stump of a great tree, and the tree spoke to them. It bade them climb upon it, and as they did so it began to rise into the air. The bear came to kill them, but they were just beyond its reach. It reared against the tree and scored the bark all around with its claws. The seven sisters were borne into the sky, and they became the stars of the Big Dipper.\n\nFrom that moment, and so long as the legend lives, the Kiowas have kinsmen in the night sky. Whatever they were in the mountains, they could be no more. However tenuous their well-being, however much they had suffered and would suffer again, they had found a way out of the wilderness.\n\nMy grandmother had a reverence for the sun, a holy regard that now is all but gone out of mankind. There was a wariness in her, and an ancient awe. She was a Christian in her later years, but she had come a long way about, and she never forgot her birthright. As a child she had been to the Sun Dances; she had taken part in those annual rites, and by them she had learned the restoration of her people in the presence of Tai-me. She was about seven when the last Kiowa Sun Dance was held in 1887 on the Washita River above Rainy Mountain Creek. The buffalo were gone. In order to consummate the ancient sacrifice--to impale the head of a buffalo bull upon the medicine tree--a delegation of old men journeyed into Texas, there to beg and barter for an animal from the Goodnight herd.\n\nShe was ten when the Kiowas came together for the last time as a living Sun Dance culture. They could find no buffalo; they had to hang an old hide from the sacred tree. Before the dance could begin, a company of soldiers rode out from Fort Sill under orders to disperse the tribe. Forbidden without cause the essential act of their faith, having seen the wild herds slaughtered and left to rot upon the ground, the Kiowas backed away forever from the medicine tree. That was July 20, 1890, at the great bend of the Washita. My grandmother was there. Without bitterness, and for as long as she lived, she bore a vision of deicide.\n\nNow that I can have her only in memory, I see my grandmother in the several postures that were peculiar to her: standing at the wood stove on a winter morning and turning meat in a great iron skillet; sitting at the south window, bent above her beadwork, and afterwards, when her vision failed, looking down for a long time into the fold of her hands; going out upon a cane, very slowly as she did when the weight of age came upon her; praying. I remember her most often at prayer. She made long, rambling prayers out of suffering and hope, having seen many things. I was never sure that I had the right to hear, so exclusive were they of all mere custom and company. The last time I saw her she prayed standing by the side of her bed at night, naked to the waist, the light of a kerosene lamp moving upon her dark skin. Her long, black hair, always drawn and braided in the day, lay upon her shoulders and against her breasts like a shawl. I do not speak Kiowa, and I never understood her prayers, but there was something inherently sad in the sound, some merest hesitation upon the syllables of sorrow. She began in a high and descending pitch, exhausting her breath to silence; then again and again--and always the same intensity of effort, of something that is, and is not, like urgency in the human voice. Transported so in the dancing light among the shadows of her room, she seemed beyond the reach of time. But that was illusion; I think I knew then that I should not see her again.\n\nHouses are like sentinels in the plain, old keepers of the weather watch. There, in a very little while, wood takes on the appearance of great age. All colors wear soon away in the wind and rain, and then the wood is burned gray and the grain appears and the nails turn red with rust. The windowpanes are black and opaque; you imagine there is nothing within, and indeed there are many ghosts, bones given up to the land. They stand here and there against the sky, and you approach them for a longer time than you expect. They belong in the distance; it is their domain.\n\nOnce there was a lot of sound in my grandmother's house, a lot of coming and going, feasting and talk. The summers there were full of excitement and reunion. The Kiowas are a summer people; they abide the cold and keep to themselves, but when the season turns and the land becomes warm and vital they cannot hold still; an old love of going returns upon them. The aged visitors who came to my grandmother's house when I was a child were made of lean and leather, and they bore themselves upright. They wore great black hats and bright ample shirts that shook in the wind. They rubbed fat upon their hair and wound their braids with strips of colored cloth. Some of them painted their faces and carried the scars of old and cherished enmities. They were an old council of warlords, come to remind and be reminded of who they were. Their wives and daughters served them well. The women might indulge themselves; gossip was at once the mark and compensation of their servitude. They made loud and elaborate talk among themselves, full of jest and gesture, fright and false alarm. They went abroad in fringed and flowered shawls, bright beadwork and German silver. They were at home in the kitchen, and they prepared meals that were banquets.\n\nThere were frequent prayer meetings, and great nocturnal feasts. When I was a child I played with my cousins outside, where the lamplight fell upon the ground and the singing of the old people rose up around us and carried away into the darkness. There were a lot of good things to eat, a lot of laughter and surprise. And afterwards, when the quiet returned, I lay down with my grandmother and could hear the frogs away by the river and feel the motion of the air.\n\nNow there is a funeral silence in the rooms, the endless wake of some final word. The walls have closed in upon my grandmother's house. When I returned to it in mourning, I saw for the first time in my life how small it was. It was late at night, and there was a white moon, nearly full. I sat for a long time on the stone steps by the kitchen door. From there I could see out across the land; I could see the long row of trees by the creek, the low light upon the rolling plains, and the stars of the Big Dipper. Once I looked at the moon and caught sight of a strange thing. A cricket had perched upon the handrail, only a few inches away from me. My line of vision was such that the creature filled the moon like a fossil. It had gone there, I thought, to live and die, for there, of all places, was its small definition made whole and eternal. A warm wind rose up and purled like the longing within me.\nThe next morning I awoke at dawn and went out on the dirt road to Rainy Mountain. It was already hot, and the grasshoppers began to fill the air. Still, it was early in the morning, and the birds sang out of the shadows. The long yellow grass on the mountain shone in the bright light, and a scissortail hied above the land. There, where it ought to be, at the end of a long and legendary way, was my grandmother's grave. Here and there on the dark stones were ancestral names. Looking back once, I saw the mountain and came away.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2893951", "artist_names": "\u200bgnash (Ft.

motherfuckin' ass\n('Til forever, 'til forever)\nOne time for your motherfuckin' mind (For MC's, MC's)\nWe represent the 313\u2014you know what I\u2019m sayin'?\nYo, they don\u2019t know shit about this, for the '96\n[Verse 1]\nAyo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction\nTo get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action\nA brainiac, in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction\nYou look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks runs\nMy rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills\nI travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills\nI'm slimin' grills of roaches with spray that disinfects\nAnd twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects\nPut this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up\nTwist 'em up and indulge in the marijuana smog\nThis is the season for noise pollution contamination\nExamination of more car-tunes than animation\nMy lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass\nOn a track for duck rapper interrogation\nWhen I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'\nI turn the stage into a barren wasteland\nI'm infinite\n\n[Hook]\nYou heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it\nI went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments\nNow I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat\nI'm tempted to make another attempt at it\nI'm infinite\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nBust it, I let the beat commence\nSo I can beat the sense in your elite defense\nI got some meat to mince\nSome fruit to stomp, and then two feet to rinse\nI greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans\nI foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans\nMy coiled hands around this microphone are lethal\nOne thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people\nMC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium\nBattle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one\nImitator intimidator, stimulator\nSimulator of data, eliminator\nThere's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus\nFuck around and catch all the venereal diseases\nMy thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces\nMy acappella releases classic masterpieces, through telekinesis\nIt eases you mentally, gently\nSentimentally, instrumentally\nWith entity, dementedly meant to be infinite\n\n[Hook]\nYou heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it\nI went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments\nNow I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat\nI'm tempted to make another attempt at it\nI'm infinite\n[Verse 3]\nMan, I got evidence, I'm never dense\nAnd I've been clever ever since\nMy residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the MO\nSo I'm assumin' all responsibility\n'Cause there's a monster real in me that always wants to kill MC's\nMic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler\nHere to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler\nNo one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical\nI get cynical, act a fool then I send a crew back to school\nI never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical\nI'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy\nIn fact, I can't see, or can't imagine\nA man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'\nSo this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo\nOn my last jam plus the man who never had a plan B\nBe all you can be\n\u2018Cause once you make an instant hit, I'm tensed a bit\nAnd tempted when I see the sins my friends commit\nI'm infinite\n\n[Hook]\nYou heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it\nI went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments\nNow I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat\nI'm tempted to make another attempt at it\nI'm infinite\nYou heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it\nI went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments\nNow I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat\nI'm tempted to make another attempt at it\nI'm infinite\n\n[Outro: Mr. Porter]\n'95 ('95), '96 ('96)\nAnd on, and on, and on, and on (And

right\nIt's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light\nMy demons visit me every night\nTo the most high, I'm forever indebted\nI know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'\nI put it all in the music\nBecause if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'\nCould feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges\nTwo birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'\nI need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'\nToo reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady\nFree C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?\nEver since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience\nBetween rocks and hard places of all places\nSpotted everywhere, like Dalmatian\nCops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous\nPlease welcome the October fall baby\nVaughan Road Academy, star player\u2014my mind's not all there\nUsed to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer\nPeople too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares\nCount it, it's all there, and we all square\nQuick money, I'm in and out\nMy dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out\nBut, shit, look at Dennis now, all Stacy Adams and linen'd out\nMore blessings for Sandi and him, more life\nMy parents never got it right\nBut God bless 'em both, I think we all alike\nWe all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change\nIf we do get to do it twice in another life\nScared to go to sleep now\n'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like\nBack when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight\nTell me how I went and did chin-ups on this shit when I can't see it\nPin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier\nSoul sisters inspired my old scriptures\nNow that feeling's gone like them old pictures\nMixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious\nYou just stare at me while you roll Swishers\nGirl, I love you, but I don't miss ya\nAnd no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er\nGo figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man\nFuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy\nTwo percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it\nGot two of my niggas off with a \"not guilty\"\nGave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it\nBut still, they try and tell you I'm not the realest\nLike I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit\nOr like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon\nI never worked to get it\nBut really it's you with all the drug dealer stories\nThat's gotta stop, though\nYou made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo\nIf you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos\nYou bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas\nLike, \"This what we need to be on,\" but you never went live\nYou middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys\nI can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes\nAnd you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives\nCan't show us where the cash is, me, I don't judge\nI'm just going off what the math is, numbers inflated\nThey all look at me, like, \"What have you done for me lately?\"\n\"I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest.\"\nAw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative\nMy numbers out of this world\nNo wonder they got me feeling so alienated\nYou were the man on the moon\nNow you just go through your phases\nLife of the angry and famous\nRap like I know I'm the greatest then give you tropical flavors\nStill never been on hiatus\nYou stay xann'd and perk'd up\nSo when reality set in, you don't gotta face it\nI'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis\nIt seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces\nI'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places\nLook what happens soon as you talk to me crazy\nIs you crazy?See Drake LiveGet tickets as low as
