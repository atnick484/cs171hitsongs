seen\", oh\nShe's only seventeen (Seventeen)\nDaddy says she's too young\nBut she's old enough for me\nMm, come to my place, we can talk it over\nOh, everythin' goin' down in your head\nShe said,

rules\nI'm amazed how much this love has touched my life\nAnd the commitment that we share is a welcome sacrifice\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThis must be sweet fatal attraction\nMy life-long date with destiny\nLove this strong, it just brings out the passion\nI never knew was here in me\n[Chorus]\nAnd I love you just because, (I love you) just because\nJust because I do - my darlin', you\nEmotions more than words can help me say\nI love you, (and I love you, and I love you) baby\nJust because you're you\n(Just because you're you)\nJust because you're you\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're a diamond in my mind, a treasure found\nA precious gem to me, you're so nice to have around\nI'm so glad I took the path that led to this\nAnd it's amazin' loving you\nI'm doin' things I never thought I'd do\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't know, there ain't no explanation\nOf why I'm sharin' love at last this way\nI won't try to work out all my reasons\nI'II use these words to simply say\n\n[Chorus]\nI love

Nightmare on My Street Lyrics[Intro: Fresh Prince]\nNow I have a story that I'd like to tell\nAbout this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!\nHe comes to me at night after I crawl into bed\nHe's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!\nHe wears the same hat and sweater every single day\nAnd even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway!\nHe's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm sleep\nI can't believe that there's a nightmare on my street!\n\n[Verse 1: Fresh Prince]\nIt was a Saturday evening, if I remember it right\nAnd we had just gotten back off tour last night\nSo the gang and I thought that it would be groovy\nIf we summoned up the posse and bum rushed the movies\nI got Angie, Jeff got Tina\nReady Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life\nThat was all right though 'cause the lady was chill\nThen we dipped to the theater set to ill\nBuggin', cold havin' a ball\nAnd somethin' \u2018bout Elm Street was the movie we saw\nThe way it started was decent, you know nothing real fancy\nAbout this homeboy named Freddy and this girl named Nancy\nBut word when it was over I said, \u201cYo, that was def!\u201d\nAnd everything seemed alright when we left\nBut when I got home and laid down to sleep\nThat began the nightmare, but on my street!\n[Verse 2: Fresh Prince & Freddy Kruger]\nIt was burning in my room like an oven\nMy bed soaked with sweat, man, I was buggin'\nI checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30\nIt had melted, it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty\nI went downstairs to grab some juice or a Coke\nFlipped the TV off, and then I almost choked\nWhen I heard this awful voice comin' from behind\nIt said, \"You turned off David Letterman, now you must die!\"\nMan, I ain't even wait to see who it was\nBroke outside in my drawers and screamed, \"So long, cuz!\"\nGot halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin'\nThen thought, \"Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin\"\nI strolled back home with a grin on my grill\nI figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill\nI walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince\nBut Freddy killed all that noise real quick\nHe grabbed me by my neck and said\n\"Here's what we'll do, we got a lot of work here, me and you\nThe souls of your friends you and I will claim\nYou've got the body, and I've got the brain\"\nI said, \"Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong\nI ain't partners with nobody with nails that long!\nLook, I'll be honest, man, this team won't work\nThe girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!\"\nI pat him on the shoulder said, \"Thanks for stopping by.\"\nThen I opened up the door and said, \"Take care guy!\"\nHe got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt\nI laughed at first, then thought, \"Hold up, that hurt!\"\nIt wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real\nI said, \"Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.\"\nNo further words and then I darted upstairs\nCrashed through my door then jumped on my bed\nPulled the covers up over my head\nAnd said, \"Oh please do somethin' with Fred!\"\nHe jumped on my bed, ripped through the covers with his claws\nTried to get me, but my alarm went off\nAnd then silence! It was a whole new day\nI thought, \"Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.\"\nUntil I noticed those rips in my sheets\nAnd that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street\nYou might also like[Outro: Fresh Prince, Jazzy Jeff & Freddy Krueger]\nOh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff\nCome on, come on\nCome on Jeff, answer\nCome on, man\nHello?\nJeff, this is Prince, man\nJeff, wake up\nJeff, wake up\nWhat do you want?\nJeff, wake up, man\nListen to me, Jeff\nIt's three o'clock in the mornin', what do you want?\nJeff, Jeff, would you listen to me?\nListen, whatever you do, don't fall asleep\nMan!\nJeff, listen to me, don't go to sleep, Jeff\nLook, look, I'll talk to you tomorrow, I'm going to bed\nRRAHHHH!\nAhhhhhh!\nJeff!

leave it alone in the heat of the night\nMet a man with a message from the other side\nCouldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind\nHe said it's up to you\nYou can run or you can fight - (ya that's right)\nBetter leave it alone in the heat of the night\n\nIn the heat of the night they'll be comin' around\nThey'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down\nIn the heat of the night\n(Where you gonna hide when it all comes down)\n(Don't look back don't ever turn around)\nHad to pay the piper to call the tune\nSaid he'd be back someday - said he'd be back real soon\nPull the

door\nI've had other lips\nI've sailed a thousand ships\nBut no matter where I go\nYou're the one for me, baby, this I know\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's true love\nYou're the one I'm dreaming of\nYour heart fits me like a glove\nAnd I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've heard all the lines\nI've cried, oh, so many times\nThose teardrops, they won't fall again\nI'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend\nSo if you should ever doubt\nWonder what love is all about\nJust think back and remember, dear\nThose words whispered in your ear, I said\n\n[Chorus]\nTrue love\nYou're the one I'm dreaming of\nYour heart fits me like a glove\nAnd I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you\n'Cause it's true love (This time I know it's true love)\nYou're the one I'm dreaming of (The one I'm

Sergey Ivanovitch walked beside her, and never left off admiring her. Looking at her, he recalled all the delightful things he had heard from her lips, all the good he knew about her, and became more and more conscious that the feeling he had for her was something special that he had felt long, long ago, and only once, in his early youth. The feeling of happiness in being near her continually grew, and at last reached such a point that, as he put a huge, slender-stalked agaric fungus in her basket, he looked straight into her face, and noticing the flush of glad and alarmed excitement that overspread her face, he was confused himself, and smiled to her in silence a smile that said too much.\n\n\"If so,\" he said to himself, \"I ought to think it over and make up my mind, and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment.\"\n\"I\u2019m going to pick by myself apart from all the rest, or else my efforts will make no show,\" he said, and he left the edge of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees standing far apart, and went more into the heart of the wood, where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel. Walking some forty paces away, Sergey Ivanovitch, knowing he was out of sight, stood still behind a bushy spindle-tree in full flower with its rosy red catkins. It was perfectly still all round him. Only overhead in the birches under which he stood, the flies, like a swarm of bees, buzzed unceasingly, and from time to time the children\u2019s voices were floated across to him. All at once he heard, not far from the edge of the wood, the sound of Varenka\u2019s contralto voice, calling Grisha, and a smile of delight passed over Sergey Ivanovitch\u2019s face. Conscious of this smile, he shook his head disapprovingly at his own condition, and taking out a cigar, he began lighting it. For a long while he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree. The soft scales of the white bark rubbed off the phosphorus, and the light went out. At last one of the matches burned, and the fragrant cigar smoke, hovering uncertainly in flat, wide coils, stretched away forwards and upwards over a bush under the overhanging branches of a birch tree. Watching the streak of smoke, Sergey Ivanovitch walked gently on, deliberating on his position.\n\n\"Why not?\" he thought. \"If it were only a passing fancy or a passion, if it were only this attraction\u2014this mutual attraction (I can call it a mutual attraction), but if I felt that it was in contradiction with the whole bent of my life\u2014if I felt that in giving way to this attraction I should be false to my vocation and my duty ... but it\u2019s not so. The only thing I can say against it is that, when I lost Marie, I said to myself that I would remain faithful to her memory. That\u2019s the only thing I can say against my feeling.... That\u2019s a great thing,\" Sergey Ivanovitch said to himself, feeling at the same time that this consideration had not the slightest importance for him personally, but would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of others. \"But apart from that, however much I searched, I should never find anything to say against my feeling. If I were choosing by considerations of suitability alone, I could not have found anything better.\"\nHowever many women and girls he thought of whom he knew, he could not think of a girl who united to such a degree all, positively all, the qualities he would wish to see in his wife. She had all the charm and freshness of youth, but she was not a child; and if she loved him, she loved him consciously as a woman ought to love; that was one thing. Another point: she was not only far from being worldly, but had an unmistakable distaste for worldly society, and at the same time she knew the world, and had all the ways of a woman of the best society, which were absolutely essential to Sergey Ivanovitch\u2019s conception of the woman who was to share his life. Thirdly: she was religious, and not like a child, unconsciously religious and good, as Kitty, for example, was, but her life was founded on religious principles. Even in trifling matters, Sergey Ivanovitch found in her all that he wanted in his wife: she was poor and alone in the world, so she would not bring with her a mass of relations and their influence into her husband\u2019s house, as he saw now in Kitty\u2019s case. She would owe everything to her husband, which was what he had always desired too for his future family life. And this girl, who united all these qualities, loved him. He was a modest man, but he could not help seeing it. And he loved her. There was one consideration against it\u2014his age. But he came of a long-lived family, he had not a single gray hair, no one would have taken him for forty, and he remembered Varenka\u2019s saying that it was only in Russia that men of fifty thought themselves old, and that in France a man of fifty considers himself dans la force de l\u2019\u00e2ge, while a man of forty is un jeune homme. But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago? Was it not youth to feel as he felt now, when coming from the other side to the edge of the wood he saw in the glowing light of the slanting sunbeams the gracious figure of Varenka in her yellow gown with her basket, walking lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree, and when this impression of the sight of Varenka blended so harmoniously with the beauty of the view, of the yellow oatfield lying bathed in the slanting sunshine, and beyond it the distant ancient forest flecked with yellow and melting into the blue of the distance? His heart throbbed joyously. A softened feeling came over him. He felt that he had made up his mind. Varenka, who had just crouched down to pick a mushroom, rose with a supple movement and looked round. Flinging away the cigar, Sergey Ivanovitch advanced with resolute steps towards her.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/292980", "artist_names": "Pet Shop Boys",

chance, forget the past\n\nWatching the actor that takes the stage by storm\nStealing the limelight while we're in the wings\nSometimes the hero must play the underdog\nBut I don't feel the same, I must have everything\nWhen the heart rules the mind\nOne look and love is blind\nWhen you want the dream to last\nTake a chance, forget the past\n\nSeasons will change\nYou must move on\nFollow your

buildin'\nSitting on the steps, feeling no feelings\nLast night, it was a cold killin'\nYou gotta keep the devil in his hole, nigga\nBut you know how it go, nigga\nI'm front line every time it's on, nigga\nHunnid proof flow, run and shoot pro\n458 drop, playin' \"Bullet Proof Soul\"\nEvery few shows, I just buy some new gold\nCircle got smaller, everybody can't go\nDowntown, Diamond District, jewelers like, \"Yo\nHussle, holla at me, I got Cubans on the low\"\nFlew to Cancun, smokin' Cubans on the boat\nThen docked at Tulum just to smoke, look\nListening to music at the Mayan Ruins\nTrue devotion on the bluest ocean, cruisin'\nMy cultural influence even rival Lucien\nI'm integrated vertically, y'all niggas blew it\nThey tell me, \"Hussle, dumb it down, you might confuse 'em\"\nThis ain't that weirdo rap you motherfuckers used to\nLike the beginning of Mean Streets\nI'm an urban legend, South Central in a certain section\nCan't express how I curved detectives\nGuess it's evidence of a divine presence, blessings\nHeld me down, at times, I seem reckless, F it\nYou got an L, but got an E for effort, stretched him\nDropped him off in the Mojave desert, then left him\nAin't no answer to these trick questions\nMoney Makin' Nip, straighten out my jewelry on my bitch dresser\nWell known, flick up and jail pose\nSnatch a champagne bottle from Rico's 'til T show\nWhatever, nigga, playin' chess, not checkers, nigga\nThirty-eight special for you clever niggas\nSee, bro, if you ain't live and die by the street code\nBeen through all these motions, up and down like a see-saw\nI can never view you as my equal\nFuck I wanna hear your CD for?\n[Chorus: Stacy Barthe & Arctic Monkeys]\nLike the beginning of Mean Streets\nLike the beginning of Mean Streets\nLike the

your purpose or you wastin' air\nFuck it, though, y'all niggas scared\nEyes opened, I can see it clear\nThey don't make 'em bar none, they don't make 'em real\nThey don't make it where I'm from, they don't take it here\nThey ain't see in due time, I be makin' mils\nBossed up in this game, I been makin' deals\nGet your lawyer on the phone, we can make it real\nI got checks and balance, I flex dramatic\nOther fifty on my neck, just my reckless habit\nAin't no pussy on my rep, disrespect the savage\nI make one phone call and the rest get handled\nIt's just another front step with

years\nYou are the only one to stop my tears\nAnd I'm so scared, I'm so scared\n[Verse 2]\nTake me back in time maybe I can forget\nTurn a different corner and we never would have met\nWould you care\nI don't understand it, for you it's a breeze\nLittle by little you've brought me to my knees\nDon't you care\nNo I've never come close in all of these years\nYou are the only one to stop my

and missin' my younger days, oh-oh\nThen you should have known me much better\n'Cause my past is somethin' that never got in my way, oh no\n\n[Verse 2]\nStill I would not be here now if I never had the hunger\nAnd I'm not ashamed to say the wild boys were my friends, oh\n'Cause I never felt the desire\n'Til their music set me on fire\n[Chorus]\nAnd then I was saved, yeah\nThat's why I'm keepin' the faith\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nKeepin' the faith\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe wore matador boots, only Flagg Brothers had 'em with a Cuban heel\nIridescent socks with the same color shirt and a tight pair of chinos\nOh, I put on my shark skin jacket, you know the kind with the velvet collar\nAnd ditty-bop shades, oh yeah\n\n[Verse 4]\nI took a fresh pack of Luckies and a mint called Sen-Sen\nMy old man's Trojans and his Old Spice aftershave, oh\nCombed my hair in a pompadour like the rest of the Romeos wore\nA permanent wave, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were keepin' the faith\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nKeepin' the faith\n\n[Bridge]\nYou can get just so much from the good thing\nYou can linger too long in your dreams\nSay goodbye to the oldies but goodies\n'Cause the good ol' days weren't always good\nAnd tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems\nSee Billy Joel LiveGet tickets as low as $87You might also like[Verse 5]\nLearned stickball as a formal education\nLost a lot of fights but it taught me how to lose okay, oh\nI heard about sex but not enough\nI found you could dance and still look tough anyway\nOh yes I did\n\n[Verse 6]\nI found out a man ain't just bein' macho\nAte an awful lot of late night drive-in food, drank a lot of take home pay\nI thought I was the Duke of Earl\nWhen I made it with a red-haired girl in a Chevrolet\nOh, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were keepin' the faith\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nKeepin' the faith\n\n[Bridge]\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nYou know the good ol' days weren't always good\nAnd tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems\n[Verse 7]\nI told you my reasons for the whole revival\nNow I'm goin' outside to have an ice cold beer in the shade, oh\nI'm going to listen to my 45's\nAin't it wonderful to be alive when the rock 'n' roll plays, yeah\nWhen the memory stays, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm keepin' the faith\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nKeepin' the faith\n\n[Outro]\nI'm keepin' the faith, yes I am\nYou know I'm

degree\n\n(You want it all right)...We're goin' in style\nSay you walk right--you talk right--and your hair's so wild\n(Snow-white)--Hey that's not what I mean\nWe go down in the shadows and crawl between\n\nMoonlight in the city brings the magic to your eyes\nFreezin' a moment--leave me paralyzed\nBreathe an emotion--set it dancin' in my ear\nBring on the rhythm when I hold you near\nTake me in your arms--roll me through the night\nTake me to your heart--rock me tonite\n\n(You do it all right)--You're passion to see\nYou been schooled in the arts of romancin' me\n(Hold tight)--You're in for a ride\nCan you feel the blood poundin' way down inside\n\n--No one's stoppin' us now--\nWe go down, down where the music's loud\n(If it's all night)--Hey that's all right by me\nGo and play on my love--play it all for me\n\nLife's never easy--we can make it if we try\nTakin' our chances--standin' side by side\nLive for the moment--on that we can agree\nCome and take me where I long to be\n\nTake me in your arms--roll me through the night\nTake me to your heart--rock me tonite\n\nTake me in your arms\nIt's alright (it's alright)\nTake me to your heart--rock me tonite\n\nA time for all...and all in time\nA step beyond the borderline\nOf who we are and where we long to be... (yeah)\nWhen every night you hear the sound\nOf wakin' up and breakin' down\nYou find a chance and heave it all away\nYou might also likeC'mon babe\nTake me in your arms--roll me through the night\nTake me to your heart--rock me tonite\n\n([unclear]) Take me in your arms\nIt's alright (it's alright)\nTake me to your heart (c'mon take me!) rock me tonite\n\nTake me in your arms--turn me to the light\nTake me to your heart\nRock me! Rock, rock, rock and rock me\nRock, rock, rock, and roll it\n\nIt's alright\nYe-yeah\nTake(?) me to the lightEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/1128276", "artist_names": "Thompson Twins", "full_title": "Doctor!
