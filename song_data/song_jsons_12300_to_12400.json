found a world of joy\nBut she lived on the morning side of the mountain\nAnd he lived on the twilight side of the hill\n\nThey never met, they never kissed\nAnd they will never know what happiness they missed\nFor she lived on the morning side of the mountain\nAnd he lived on the twilight side of the hill\n\nFor love's a rose that never grows\nWithout the kiss of the morning dew\nAnd every Jack must have a Jill\nTo know the thrill of a dream that comes true\nAnd you and I are just like they\nFor all we know our love is just a kiss away\nBut you are on the morning side of the mountain\nAnd I am on the twilight side of the hill\n\nFor love's a rose that never grows\nWithout the kiss of the morning dew\nAnd every Jack must have a Jill\nTo know the thrill of a dream that comes true\n\nAnd

you\nYou made my world of dreams come true\n(of dreams come true)\nThe years may come, and years may pass\nAnd I reach the end of lifes journey at last\nThough time may change me in some ways it's true\nIt could never change my love, for you\n(change my love, for you)\n\nOh, when I'm gone, you bury me\nOn the highest mountain of history\nThen all the world will hear me cry\nMy love for you will

filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm\nHe changed his clothes and shined his boots\nAnd combed his dark hair down\nAnd his mother cried as he walked out\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't take your guns to town son\nLeave your guns at home, Bill\nDon't take your guns to town\n[Verse 2]\nHe laughed and kissed his mom\nAnd said your Billy Joe's a man\nI can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can\nBut I wouldn't shoot without a cause\nI'd gun nobody down\nBut she cried again as he rode away\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't take your guns to town son\nLeave your guns at home, Bill\nDon't take your guns to town\n\n[Verse 3]\nHe sang a song as on he rode\nHis guns hung at his hips\nHe rode into a cattle town\nA smile upon his lips\nHe stopped and walked into a bar\nAnd laid his money down\nBut his mother's words echoed again\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't take your guns to town son\nLeave your guns at home, Bill\nDon't take your guns to town\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nHe drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand\nAnd tried to tell himself at last he had become a man\nA dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down\nAnd he heard again his mothers words\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't take your guns to town son\nLeave your guns at home, Bill\nDon't take your guns to town\n\n[Verse 5]\nFilled with rage then\nBilly Joe reached for his gun to draw\nBut the stranger drew his gun and fired\nBefore he even saw\nAs Billy Joe fell to the floor\nThe crowd all gathered around\nAnd wondered at his final words\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't take your guns to town son\nLeave your guns at home, Bill\nDon't take your guns to town1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1600101", "artist_names": "Joni James", "full_title": "There Must Be A Way

Lyrics[Intro: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]\nOoh\n\n[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]\nWatch\u200a 'nother Richard\nIt's\u200a a million plus three reasons I lied\nI couldn't admit it\nAnd I just don't want you to waste my time\n'Cause\u200a I'm tryna get with ya\nI\u200a be feelin' down but I'm fine when I'm with ya\nYou be thinkin' I be lyin' when I say I miss you\nGirl,\u200a you know I'm on your body, on your body like a tissue\nThey be callin' you Illuminati when I'm with you (Illuminati when I'm with you)\nI say, \"Maybe, it's your third eye,\" I love your mental (Third eye, I love your mental)\nVVS's on me look like Now and Laters, lick you up\nI\u200a bet you never go back to the guy that was with you (Guy that was with you)\nShe got every pair of Chanel out of SoHo\nTribeca, hit the city to show off\nAnd when you get dressed up, you take hours\nBaby girl, you know you can do whatever, you got...\n[Verse 2: Khalid]\nPower\nGot me sittin' by my phone, I've been waiting for hours\nOn my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower\nSo I might as well swing over to your place, mmh, nah\nIt's crowded\nIn LA, but I'll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it\nSay you're down, I could show you around if you're really about it, yeah\nBut for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?\nWhat do you say?\n\n[Chorus: Khalid]\nShould we bring it right back?\nHonestly, it's better like that\nI know we've been falling off track\nBring it right back\nI just let the time roll past\nWe don't gotta take it too fast\nBring it right back\nYou don't gotta stay the night\nI just wanna take the time\nI know all the things you like\nMaybe if the mood is right\nWe can bring it right back\n\n[Verse 3: Khalid]\nSaved\nGot the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded\nBut if that's not the vibe, yeah, it's cool\nWe can save it for later, yeah\nI just like the way it feels when you're around\nWhen you're around, ah\nNow I know we're not dating, nah\nMaybe soon by the way things go, we've been talking for ages\nTake it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love\nIf the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out\nIt'll all work out, yeah\nYou might also like[Chorus: Khalid]\nShould we bring it right back?\nHonestly, it's better like that\nI know we've been falling off track\nBring it right back\nI just let the time

good kids\nAnd Daddy told us never listen to the ones\nPointing nasty fingers and making fun\n'Cause we were good kids\n\n[Verse 1]\nRemember asking both my mom and dad\nWhy we never travelled to exotic lands\nWe only ever really visit friends\nNothing to tell when the summer ends\nWe never really went buying clothes\nFolks were passing on the stuff in plenty loads\nNew shoes once a year and then\nOut to play ball so we could ruin them\n[Chorus]\nWhen Mama said that it was okay\nMama said that it was quite alright\nOur kind of people had a bed for the night\nAnd it was okay\nMama told us we were good kids\nAnd Daddy told us never listen to the ones\nPointing nasty fingers and making fun\n'Cause we were good kids\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I didn\u2019t have it bad\nI got enough loving from my mom and dad\nBut I don\u2019t think they really understood\nWhen I said that I wanted a deal in Hollywood\nI told them I'd be singing on TV\nThe other kids were calling me a wannabe\nThe older kids, they started bugging me\nBut now they're all standing right in front of me\n[Chorus]\nWhen Mama said that it was okay\nMama said that it was quite alright\nOur kind of people had a bed for the night\nAnd it was okay\nMama told us we were good kids\nAnd Daddy told us never listen to the ones\nPointing nasty fingers and making fun\n'Cause we were good kids\nYou might also

story\nThat\u2019s why I always keep them tight\nAnd why I'm okay\nI said I'm okay\nYou know what my mama said?\nYou know what she told me?\n[Chorus]\nWhen Mama said that it was okay\nMama said that it was quite alright\nOur kind of people had a bed for the night\nAnd it was okay\nMama told us we were good kids\nAnd Daddy told us never listen to the ones\nPointing nasty fingers and making

ayy\nI'm a rich blood, by the way\nAnd I'm havin' swag, Rollie old like a tape\nFish scale, yeah, I got these bitches on the bait\nDon't wanna talk, man, I said, I need some space\nWoop, woop, woop, my new car geeked up\nI just paid a cop, now I'm runnin' out of court\nPanoramic top, I'ma put it on the rocks\nCrawl, walk and hop, got all of these bitches shocked, ayy\nStone molly whiter than my socks\nI don't wanna talk if it ain't 'bout guap\nClone a young nigga and still flop\nI buy pints by the two no Pac\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nBaby, pass me the hookah\nBaby, pass me the hookah\nBaby, pass me the hookah\nAyy, baby, just pass me the hookah\nBaby, pass me the hookah, ayy\nBaby, pass me the hookah, ayy\nBaby, pass me the hookah\nPass me the hookah, pass the hookah, pass the hookah\n\n[Verse 2: Tyga]\nAh, rubbin' on my chain, blowin' cloudmatic\nSmoke somethin' with a G and bend that ass backwards\nLay back, relax and talk mathematics\nLater on, we test a little sex practice\nWrite my name on the wall\nMoney in the mattress, bet she wanna get involved\nShe hopped on the blunt, say, where the hookah y'all?\nI tell her pass back if the shit too strong, it's all set\nMozart art on the block, so wet\nI got her where I want her and I ain't done yet\nLookin' at your future, baby, put down the cigarette\nCome hop on this kush jet and take flight, yeah\nTell them bitches, hmm fuck that\nYou with Aladdin, bet I got a magic carpet for that ass, yes\nI'm also on one, got two Olsen's on me\nBig homie, Young Thugger Thugger, rollin'\nRolls Royce so shorty\nYou

band wagon\nI got the chain saggy, you know that life lavish\nLifestyles like this, gon' need Magnums\nPass baby, welcome to rich class, baby\nYou all Maybelline, with ya new Celine\nAudemars on lean, cars on sheen\nYou white girl, but black girl ghetto fly thing\nIt's verified, they ain't on your sea level\nWatered eyes, don't cry, inhale and breathe regular\nMy baby on it, high at the crack of dawnin'\nBody shape, figure eight, like Picasso draw ya\nOh, yes, I'm winnin', bling kingin', ring blingin'\nLike, like, for no reason, let's get closer, closed in\nRemove your clothes, we close friends\nDon't get choked smokin' OG Oakland, shout out Oakland\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nBaby, pass me the hookah\nBaby, pass me the hookah\nBaby, pass me the hookah\nAyy, baby, just pass me the hookah\nBaby, pass me the hookah, ayy\nBaby, pass me the hookah, ayy\nBaby, pass me the hookah\nPass me the hookah, pass the hookah, pass the hookah\n\n[Outro: Tyga]\nFor all my bitches that smoke

way to break yours, too\n[Chorus]\nWhere the wind blows babe\nYou can bet I'll be riding high with it\nHolding on for my dear life just like I always did\nClose your eyes babe, take a breath\nSay my name and I'll be there\nMy love will find you anywhere\nAnywhere my love\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe city lights look like a country sky\nLike staring at the stars turned upside down\nI wish I may, I wish I might\nFind it in your heart to stick around\nI hate it had to end this way\nTomorrow is a brand new day\nAnd the chances here at love are precious few\nSomeone's out there waiting\nFor a sweet good timing lady\nTo make you smile the way I always wanted to\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere the wind blows babe\nYou can bet I'll be riding high with it\nHolding on for my dear life just like I always did\nClose

fit cause you're whiskey dick, this is what you say\nSorry for party rocking\nOh!\n\n[Verse 3: Redfoo]\nI don't give a fuck when I'm in the club\nSipping bub, really drunk, and I see a fat
