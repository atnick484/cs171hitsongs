does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?\nSaid it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?\nShe took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun\nShe got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun\nChatted some more, one more drink at the bar\nThen put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance\n[Chorus]\nYou know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band\nBut she fell in love with an English man\nKissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand\nSaid, \"Baby, I just want to dance\"\nWith my pretty little Galway Girl\nYou're my pretty little Galway Girl\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool\nAnd then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room\nAs last orders were called was when she stood on the stool\nAfter dancing the c\u00e9ili singing to trad tunes\nI never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet\nA cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat\nOh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week\nAnd in this packed out room swear she was singing to me\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band\nBut she fell in love with an English man\nKissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand\nSaid,

with the cold air of the night\nI walked her home then she took me inside\nTo finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine\nI swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write\nAbout a Galway Girl and a perfect night\n\n[Chorus]\nShe played the fiddle in an Irish band\nBut she fell in love with an English man\nKissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand\nSaid, \"Baby, I just want to

Lyrics[Intro]\nYeah, for the dogs dem, you know\nMan when shit gets like this, man the whole city\nShit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop\nKnow shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better\n\n[Verse 1]\nLook, mama hit my phone and said rap's no good\nBetter than her telling me the check's no good\nNow they wanna act like I do no good\nFunny 'cause I really did more than I should\nI made a decision last night that I would die for it\nJust to show the city what it takes to be alive for it\nCan't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it\nYou know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it\nAnd I can't sleep these days unless I take one\nIf they don't have a story these days, they'll make one\nLife is always on, man, I never get a break from it\nDoesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it\nThey give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it\nSame way, breads gotta break for it\nKeeping people fed is my only peace of mind now\nAnd I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now\nI made a decision last night that I would die for it\n[Chorus: Mavado & Drake]\n(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)\n(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)\n(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)\n(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand\nI'ma start telling niggas \"Get it how you can\"\nI got it right now so I'm everybody's friend\nIf I ever lose I bet we never speak again\nI made a decision last night, I'd die for it\nJust to show the city what it takes to be alive for it\nFirst place, first place, man we can't be tied for it\nI only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it\nKeychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things\nMJ in every way, I just don't fade away\nSix upside down, it's a nine now\nLike Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now\nAnd I made a decision last night that I would die for it\n\n[Chorus: Mavado & Drake]\n(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)\n(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)\n(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah,

prove\nYou got a fast car\nAnd I got a plan to get us out of here\nI've been working at a convenience store\nManaged to save just a little bit of money\nWe won't have to drive too far\nJust across the border and into the city\nYou and I can both get jobs\nAnd finally see what it means to be living\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou got a fast car\nIs it fast enough so we can fly away?\nWe gotta make a decision\nWe leave tonight or live and die this way\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I remember we were driving, driving in your car\nThe speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk\nCity lights lay out before us\nAnd your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\nAnd I, I had a feeling that I belonged\nAnd I, I had a feeling that I could be someone\nHad a feeling that I could be someone\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou see, my old man's got a problem\nHe lives with the bottle, that's the way it is\nHe says his body's too old for working\nI say, his body's too young to look like his\nMy mama went off and left him\nShe wanted more from life than he could give\nI said, somebody's got to take care of him\nSo I quit school and that's what I did\nYou got a fast car\nAnd we go cruising to entertain ourselves\nYou still ain't got a job\nAnd I work in a market as a checkout girl\nI know things will get better\nYou'll find work and I'll get promoted\nWe'll move out of the shelter\nBuy a bigger house and live in the suburbs\nYou might also

bales everywhere\nI see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere\nI see hell everywhere, I get mail everywhere\nWalked inside the booth and came out in a Learjet\nA fiend for that lean, I ain't start drinking beer yet\nThey bust the trap, I live there\nCame out clean, I ain't clean, my niggas still there\nJust imagine you was livin' lavish and they still there\nWake up in the crib, pool sitting on the hill now\nI just need some niggas with me that's gon' keep it real now\nGot a lot of pretty bitches, I just pay they bills now\nMoney make her feel good, but damn she make me feel good\nKnown for getting that guala out in Europe, but I'm still hood\nKnown to pop a bottle on a model, fuck her like I'm on my last damn dollar\nYou might also like[Chorus: Future]\nReportin' live from the fuckin'

mask\nAnd take off your costume\nAnd if anyone asks you're\nTakin' a smoke break, you\nDrinking some coffee\nBut everyone knows what you're doin'\nSeems like the bus moves slower\nJust 'cause you got somewhere to go, so\nYou take a few pills in Beverly Hills\nBut if anyone asks you've\nGot a prescription, you\nGot an addiction\nWho do you think that you're foolin'?\n[Chorus: Priscilla Renea]\nJohn Doe\nI just want the John I know\nOnce you put the drinks on hold\nMaybe you could come back home\nJohn Doe\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\n[Verse 1: B.o.B]\nAh\nErrybody's addicted to somethin'\nErrybody got a grip onto somethin'\nEven if it's just to feel the response of appeal\nMaybe once, maybe twice\nMaybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times\nWithout it, it's just harder to function at times\nYou race to the bottom of every single bottle\nAs if there was someone or somethin' to find\nYou struggle in your mind\nAnd you tell yourself lie after lie\n'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private\nThe people that you work with notice the signs\nWhen you walk in the room it gets noticeably quiet\nSo you break up the silence\nYou say you've been at the gym\nBut the way that you look, can't blame on the diet\nSo what you hidin'?\nYou might also like[Chorus: Priscilla Renea]\nJohn Doe\nI just want the John I know\nOnce you put the drinks on hold\nMaybe you could come back home\nJohn Doe\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nYeah\nI probably had too many things\nSmashed too many freaks\nHad too much to dro...\nI mean, had too much to drink\nLeft the club, ended up in custody\nRandom drug test, passed it luckily\nMy girl broke up with me 'cause she walked in suddenly\nWith a woman up under me\nI told her \"Wait!\nIt ain't what it look like!\nI must've slipped and fell, clumsy me!\"\nWell at least I admit it\n'Cause the worst you could do is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it\nThat's just how you prevent it\nWell I ain't no different, I love all the money, the fame and the parties with beautiful women\nI spent so much time as a underground artist 'cause I was afraid to succumb to the business\nAnd what I'd become\nBut that what you'd judge you become\nThe path with the greatest resistance\nThat's how the tables can turn, when they pivot and change your perspective and flip your entire position\nMy whole life I've been dyin' and wishin' to live and experience everything possible\nWhen I told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical, now I can see it, it's optical\n[Chorus: Priscilla Renea]\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh\nJohn Doe\nI just want the John I know\nOnce you put the drinks on hold\nMaybe you could come back home\nJohn Doe33Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/646866", "artist_names": "Sara

I'll never make you suffer\nAnd all I ask in return is some reciprocation\nI'll be your oxygen when you're running out of patience\nSo take a deep breath, and hold it tight\nMy heart is yours, just

year\nThree months apart, but on the same sphere\nStaring at the sun, inhaling the same air\nThis type of love we got, they'll never get it\nI'll be the Leo DiCaprio to your Kate Winslet\nSometimes I panic, but I never take it for granted\nI'll hold you 'til my lips turn blue like Jack in Titanic\nAnd if I lose my grip, then just promise me this\nYou'll keep my love in a locket and always rock it, like\n\n[Chorus: Jason Mraz & (Travie McCoy)]\nHey yo, never let go of me (Never let go, never let go)\nHold tight, it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, mama, hold tight)\nAnd I will never let

neighborhood of clones\nI'm looking at the crowd and they're staring at their phones\nThey groom the coast line here, the sun will disappear (Oh God!)\nAnd maybe once a year, I think I'll clean my car\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nCaught my reflection, I drop the call\nI've been medicated with cigarettes and alcohol\nI got vertigo, no, I can't see straight\nI got obligations, though I'm usually late,

in anything?\nWill he make it out alive?\nAlright, alright\nNo church in the wild\n[Verse 1: JAY-Z]\nTears on the mausoleum floor\nBlood stains the Colosseum doors\nLies on the lips of a priest\nThanksgiving disguised as a feast\nRolling in the Rolls-Royce Corniche\nOnly the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police\nCocaine seats\nAll white like I got the whole thing bleached\nDrug dealer chic\nI'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach\nIs Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?\nSocrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?\nAll for Plato, screech\nI'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks\nJesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats\nHova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats\nPreach\n[Chorus: Frank Ocean]\nHuman beings in a mob\nWhat's a mob to a king?\nWhat's a

zebra\nI call that jungle fever\nYou will not control the threesome\nJust roll the weed up until I get me some\nWe formed a new religion\nNo sins as long as there's permission\nAnd deception is the only felony\nSo never fuck nobody without telling me\nSunglasses and Advil\nLast night was mad real\nSun coming up, 5 a.m.\nI wonder if they got cabs still\nThinking 'bout the girl in all leopard\nWho was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard\nTwo tattoos, one read, \"No apologies\"\nThe other said, \"Love is cursed by monogamy\"\nThat's something that the pastor don't preach\nThat's something that a teacher can't teach\nWhen we die, the money, we can't keep\nBut we'll probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap\nPreach\n[Chorus: Frank Ocean]\nHuman beings in a mob\nWhat's a mob to a

brain\nAn eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame\nYou don't like it, then peel off, bitch\nEvery last woman on Earth I'll kill off\nAnd I still wouldn't fuck you, slut\nSo wipe the smile on your grill off\nI swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off\nGet the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off\nSnap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod\nQuit hollering, \"Why, God?\"\nHe ain't got shit to do with it\nBygones'll never be bygones\nThe world ain't finished swallowing my wad\nI ain't finished blowing it, nice bra\nHope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard\nI swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad\nWith fake tits and a bad dye job\nWho just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad\nSo finally I broke down and bought her an iPod\nAnd caught her stealing my music\nSo I tied her arms and legs to the bed\nSet up the camera and pissed twice on her\nLook, two pees and a tripod\nThe moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?\nKick it back in its face, my God\nIt's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd\nBut don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?\nThe world-world is my punching bag and\nIf I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots\nMake that face, go on, scrunch it up at me\nShow me the target so I can lunge and attack it\nLike a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon\nYou fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon\nYou must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end\nTold you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]\nIs this the thanks that I get for

I'm just a humble tomato farmer, selling his wares. Whoops, I dropped one. (Throws a tomato at Stan's left eye) Whoops, I dropped another one. (Throws a tomato at Stan's right eye)\n\nStan: Ugh! (Tomatoes still covering his eyes, looks up at sky and screams:) PIONEER DAY!\n\nCut to the twins sitting near a large statue of Nathaniel Northwest.\n\nMabel: Dipper, can I ask you something? Do you think I'm silly?\n\nDipper: Uh, nnnoooo?\n\nMabel: I knew it! The nacho earrings, the sweater. I thought I was being charming, but I guess people see me as a big joke. (Throws off her nacho earrings, takes off her sweater, and ties her sweater around her waist)\n\nDipper: C'mon, Mabel, you love that sweater!\n\nMabel: I did before Pacifica ruined it for me. She ruins everything!\n\nDipper: (Stands up, turns around, and glares at the statue) Pacifica! Why does she think that being related to the town founder means she can treat everyone like garbage. Someone needs to take her down a peg. (Gasps) Wait a minute! I feel like I read something about Pacifica's great-great-grandfather before. (Opens Journal 3) Of course! Oh, this is perfect. (In a deep voice:) In my investigations... (Normal voice:) Should- should I do the voice?\n\nMabel: Nuh-uh.\n\nDipper: I'll just read... normal. (Reading from journal:) In my investigations, I recently made a discovery. Nathaniel Northwest may not be the true founder of Gravity Falls! I believe this secret is buried somewhere on the enclosed document. If only I could crack the code. (Opens the document, revealing a complex series of letters, symbols and words) Oh, man! If this cover-up is true, it means Pacifica's whole family is a fraud. This could be a major conspiracy!\n\nMabel: Really?\n\nDipper: I got to investigate this!\n\nMabel: Wait! I'm coming with you. Conspiracies are serious, right?\n\nDipper: Oh yeah, definitely.\n\nMabel: Well, if I help you crack this code, then nobody could call me silly again!\n\nDipper: Yeah! Mystery twins?\n\nMabel: I thought you hated that.\n\nDipper: I'm starting to accept it.\n\nDipper and Mabel: (Fist bump and run off)\n\nBlubs: (Behind the statue, into a walkie-talkie:) This is Sheriff Blubs. We've got a code sepia!\n\nDispatcher: (Spits out coffee) What?! And what are you doing about it?\n\nBlubs: I'm following them right now.\n\nDispatcher: Find them and stop them. There's no room for error.\n\nBlubs: I understand. Blubs out. (To Durland:) Deputy Durland, maintaining this cover-up is the mission we've been training for our entire careers. Are you ready?\n\nDurland: (Ringing bell) Woo!\n\nBlubs: Hehe, if being delightful was a crime, you'd be breaking the law.\n\nDurland: Let's go get 'em!\n\nCuts to inside the Gravity Falls Library.\n\nMcGucket: Back in the olden days, pioneers drew subsistence from telling stories 'round the fire. So let's eat some books, children! Go ahead, eat the books! (Chews a book)\n\nDipper: Alright, Mabel, if we can prove Nathaniel Northwest wasn't the real founder of Gravity Falls, it will finally put Pacifica in her place.\n\nMabel: And solving a mystery will prove that I'm not silly. I'm serious. Seeeeriousss... (Laps up candy from the table into her mouth with her tongue)\n\nDipper: (Places some slides into a projector) We just need to crack this code. Let me see... it's not Egyptian, it's not numerology, it's not, wait-of course! The triangle is the alchemist symbol for flame. Lighting the parchment on fire will reveal the secret message!\nMabel: It's so obvious!\nDipper\tAlright, let's just light this sucker up and--- Mabel!\n\nMabel\t(Now wearing a hat she made out of the document) Mwop! I just made a hat. Ugh, I just did something silly again. (Blows a raspberry)\n\nDipper: Wait, Mabel. You folded it into a map! And I was gonna burn it...\n\nBlubs: (To a librarian:) We're on the lookout for two kids who might be reading.\n\nDurland: We're hunting them down for secret reasons! (Rings bell) WOO!\n\nDipper and Mabel: (Hide under the table.)\n\nDurland: (Knocks row of books off a shelf) DERP!\n\nDipper: (To Mabel:) Maybe we should take this elsewhere...\n\nMabel: This map should lead us to... (Cut to the twins standing in front of a museum.) ...The Gravity Falls Museum of History.\n\nDipper: You realize what this means, Mabel. (Looks up and squints.) We're gonna have to break in.\n\nDramatic music plays. Cut to Dipper and Mabel inside the museum at the entrance.\n\nSue: ...And here are your free Pioneer Day passes, and your balloons, blue and pink. (Hands them balloons)\n\nDramatic music plays.\n\nDipper: (Still looking up and squinting) We're in.\n\nMabel: (Walking through museum) What are we gonna do next, steal Thomas Jefferson's rib cage?\n\nDipper: Ewww, no. According to the map, the next clue about the real town founder should be right... here!\n\nA triangular exhibition piece is mounted on the wall.\n\nDipper: We've gotta figure this one out quick, I have a feeling those cops weren't at the library to check out books...\n\nMabel: I don't think the one with the bell can read...\n\nDipper: So what is it anyway?\n\nThe twins analyze the exhibit.\n\nBoth: Hmmmm...\n\nMabel gets bored and walks over to a bench to sit down.\n\nMabel: (Walks over to a bench and sits down; turning upside-down on the bench) Hey painting, be less stupid! (Gasps) It worked!\n\nDipper: Huh? (Runs over and lays upside-down on the bench) Wait! It's not abstract, it's upside-down!\n\nMabel: I think I've seen that statue at the cemetery.\n\nDipper: Let's go! Quick!\n\nBoth: (Stand up and get dizzy, holding their heads) Ow.\n\nDipper: Head rush.\n\nSue: (To Deputy Durland:) I'm sorry, but we're all out of pink balloons.\n\nDurland: (Disappointed:) Why did we even come?\n\nDispatcher: (Over walkie-talkie:) Officer Blubs.\n\nBlubs: (Runs into the museum so that they're out of earshot; using walkie-talkie:) Blubs here.\n\nDispatcher: Have the targets been apprehended?\n\nBlubs: Negative, but we're close. I promise, those kids'll never get past us.\n\nDipper and Mabel: (Run past them)\n\nBlubs: Hey! Wait!\n\nBlubs and Durland chase the kids out of the museum but get stuck in the door.\n\nBlubs: Dang it!\n\nCut to the Woodpecker and husband's house.\n\nWoodpecker guy: For the last time, we are not going south for the winter! Our home is here!\n\nWoodpecker: (Pecks the table)\n\nWoodpecker guy: You always say that! (Storms out of the house)\n\nStan: (Struggling to get out of the stocks, trying to unlock the lock with a hairpin in his mouth) C'mon! C'mon, ugh! (Drops pin)\n\nPacifica: (Picks up the pin) Well, if it isn't Mabel's uncle, Mr. Pines. Looking for this? (Holds up the pin)\n\nStan: Yeah, yeah. What d' ya want, money?\n\nPacifica: I want you to say that the Northwest family is the best family in Gravity Falls.\n\nStan: Oh sure, you want that in writing?\n\nPacifica: (Gives Stan a pen and let him writes something on a note with his mouth)\n\nStan: There you go. (The note says \"YOU STINK!\") Ha! I did that with my mouth!\n\nPacifica: (Whistles, catching the attention of people with tomatoes, and points to Stan)\n\nStan: Aw, come on!\n\nCuts to Dipper and Mabel in the cemetery. Dipper is looking at the statue that is pointing off in the distance.\n\nDipper: Ah... The statue must be pointing to the next clue. (Looks in direction statue is pointing but then turns back when Mabel speaks up)\n\nMabel: (The finger of the statue sticking in her nose) Oh, gross! She's picking my nose! Ha ha! (The tip of the statue's finger bends upward, opening a secret door in the grave) Ach.\n\nDipper: Mabel, look!\n\nMabel: Ha! Who's silly now, Pacifica? Bam! (Tries to jump down from statue but her nose is still there so the finger tugs on her nose) Ahh! Ow. Ow. Ow. (Getting down from the statue) Okay. Now we're getting into real conspiracy mode. I feel serious. Mmm. (Eats candy)\n\nDipper: Okay, look out for booby traps.\n\nMabel: Ha! Booby traps. (Steps on a tile that triggers a bunch of darts to fly out of the wall towards her and Dipper)\n\nDipper: Tranquilizer darts! (Grabs Mabel's hand and maneuvers through the darts)\n\nMabel: Aah!\n\nThey dodge the darts and fall down a path that leads them to a small setup filled with confidential, historical information.\n\nMabel: It's a treasure trove of historic-y, secret-y things. (Picks up a top-secret document. The first page is about the secret of Abraham Lincoln's hat and shows a picture of Lincoln in his top hat in one picture, and him without his top hat, with a hand sticking out of the top of his head, in the other. Mabel looks at the next page, where there is a picture of Benjamin Franklin wearing earrings, and the sub-caption says that he was secretly a woman) Oh, man! Ben Franklin secretly was a woman!\n\nDipper: (Finding and picking up a document titled \"Northwest Cover-up\") Hey, jackpot! Now we'll find out who the real town founder was. (Reading from document:) \"Let it be here recorded that Nathaniel Northwest, fabled founder of Gravity Falls, was, in fact, a fraud...as well as a waste-shoveling village idiot\"? (Laughs) Oh, bad news for Pacifica. Wait'll the papers hear about this!\n\nMabel: Once people see that I uncovered a historical conspiracy, they can never call me silly!\n\nDipper: (Reading from document:) \"The true founder of Gravity Falls was sir lord, Quentin Trembley, III, Esquire.\"\n\nMabel: Who's Quentin Trembley?\n\nBlubs: That's none of your business!\n\nDurland: Whoo! We gotcha! Whoo! (Weakly:) Whoo! Hmm whoo-hoo. (Passes out. Several tranquilizer darts are sticking out of his back and head)\n\nBlubs: He got hit with quite a few of those darts.\n\nCommercial break\n\nBlubs: But Quentin Trembley's a matter of national security.\n\nDurland: Yeah! Ye--ah (Puts hands on knees) woo. I think I might be colorblind now.\n\nDipper: What do you mean, \"national security?\"\n\nMabel: And who is Quentin Trembley, anyway?\n\nBlubs: See for yourself. (Removes hat and takes out a reel of film. He puts it into a projector, and the projection screen shows a countdown in black and white)\n\nMabel: Aww, it's black and white?!\n\nDipper: Shh! Mabel.\n\nThe reel starts, revealing a government official in an office.\n\nGovt. official: If you're watching this, then you are one of eight people in these United States with clearance to view this information. In fact, I myself will be shot as soon as the filming is complete. (Looks offscreen) --What? No? Ho! Well, that's a relief! (Looks back at the camera) Of all of America's secrets, the most embarrassing was that of Quentin Trembley: The eighth-and-a-half president of the United States.\n\nDipper and Mabel: President?\n\nMabel: Eighth-and-a-half?\n\nGovt. official: After winning the 1837 election in a landslide, (On the video, a picture of Quentin Trembley standing next to the other presidential candidates is shown. A landslide kills the other candidates) Quentin Trembley quickly gained a reputation as America's silliest president.\nHe waged war on pancakes, appointed six babies to the supreme court, and issued the de-pants-ipation proclamation. His state of the union speech was even worse.\n\nTrembley: (reenacted recording)\tThe only thing we have to fear is gigantic, man-eating spiders!\n\nGovt. official: He was kicked out of office and escaped to an uncharted valley he named Gravity Falls, after plummeting into it at high speed. Trembley's shameful term was erased from history and officially replaced by William Henry Harrison as President and local nobody Nathaniel Northwest as founder of Gravity Falls. The whereabouts of president Trembley's body are unknown.\n\nBlubs: Until now.\n\nCut to Quentin Trembley, who is encased in an amber-colored rectangle.\n\nDipper: Whoa! Is that, like, amber or something?\n\nBlubs: The fool thought he could live forever by encasing himself in a block of solid peanut brittle. Smooth move, Mr. President! Finding Trembley's body was our special mission. And now, thanks to you, it's complete.\n\nDurland: Who knew all we had to do was follow a little girl's (Holds up one of Mabel's candy wrappers) trail of candy wrappers?\n\nMabel: Ugh, (Face-palms) silly!\n\nBlubs: Now that you know the truth, well, we can't let you go around talkin' about it.\n\nDipper: Does that mean--?\n\nMabel: Are you going to kill us?!\n\nDurland: OH NO!\n\nBlubs: No, no. (To Durland:) Calm down now, buddy, calm down. (To the twins:) We're just gonna escort you and all this stuff back to Washington. You ain't comin' back, by the way.\n\nCut to the inside of a train\n\nDurland: (Unfolds fold-out bed) Woo-hoo! We got fold-out beds!\n\nBlubs: (Opens suitcase and pulls out a book) Good thing I brought my book of spooky ghost stories!\n\nDurland: (Takes out colored rope) I brought rope for friendship bracelets!\n\nCut to Dipper and Mabel who are trapped in a crate with Quentin Trembley's body.\n\nMabel: Anyone there?! Help help help!\n\nDipper: Hey! Let us out!\n\nMabel: Oh. I can't believe I left a trail of candy wrappers. This is all my fault. Pacifica had me pegged all along. I'm just a silly failure, like that embarrassing president what's-his-name. (Eats piece of peanut brittle, breaking the block and freeing Trembley)\n\nDipper and Mabel: Aahh!\n\nTrembley: It is I, Quentin Trembley. (Rips off pants)\n\nDipper: You're alive! But how?\n\nMabel: Peanut brittle really does have life-sustaining properties! You're not silly, you're brilliant!\n\nTrembley: And so are you, dear girl, for following my clues and freeing me from my delicious tomb!\n\nDipper: He's right! Making maps into hats, hanging upside-down; Your silliness solved the code that serious cops couldn't crack in a hundred years!\n\nMabel: Oh, stop it.\n\nTrembley: By Jefferson! We seem to be trapped in some sort of crate-shaped box.\n\nMabel: It's a crate, Mr. President.\n\nTrembley: (Pulls out key) Good thing I have the President's Key, which can open any lock in America! (Repeatedly slams it at the side of the crate)\n\nDipper: I... don't think that's gonna work.\n\nTrembley: Wood! My age-old enemy. In order to get out of here, this is going to take the silliest plan ever conceived.\n\nDipper: I think I know who can help you. (Smiles at Mabel)\n\nMabel: Hmm. How 'bout... that hole? (Points to a tiny hole near the corner of the crate)\n\nTrembley: We will leap through it!\n\nTrembley and Mabel: (Jump at the hole)\n\nTrembley: (To Mabel, who's poking her finger through hole and moving it around:) Almost. Almost there Good! Keep pushing.\n\nDipper: I'm not sure this is working.\n\nMabel: Trust... the silliness!\n\nTrembley: Fiddlesticks! Keep going!\n\nA woodpecker flies in and pecks at the crate, making a tapping noise.\n\nTrembley: Is that my third wife? Sandy?\n\nThe box falls apart.\n\nTrembley: Well, we didn't fit through the hole. Let's rebuild the box and try again!\n\nDipper: We gotta get out of here!\n\nTrembley: Also good!\n\nDipper opens a door in the train and Durland, who is getting ice, sees the three of them and drops the bucket of ice.\n\nDurland: Blubs!\n\nDipper, Mabel, and Trembley run away. They climb up a ladder to get to the emergency escape. Trembley pulls out his key and starts pressing it against the door even though there's no lock.\n\nDipper: (Taking the key from Trembley) Give me that! (Turns the handle and they all run out onto the roof of the train, followed by Blubs and Durland)\n\nBlubs: There (Huffs) is (Huffs) no (Huffs) escape! I gotta take a knee.\n\nDurland: Are you okay? Can I get you anything?\n\nBlubs: Edwin, darlin', you are a diamond in the rough.\n\nDipper: Sheriff Blubs, do you really want to lock us all up in a government facility somewhere?\n\nBlubs: I've got no choice! Our orders come from the very top!\n\nDipper: Wait! Quentin, did you ever sign an official resignation?\n\nTrembley: No, sir. I ate a salamander and jumped out the window.\n\nDipper: Then... technically you're still legally the President of the United States, right? (To Blubs and Durland:) You've gotta answer to this guy now!\n\nBlubs and Durland: Huh?\n\nTrembley: As president of these several United States, I hereby order you to pretend none of this ever happened. And- and go on a delightful vacation. (As the train goes by he hits his head on a metal rail) Ow! Mmm, yeeees!\n\nBlubs: Vacation? (To Durland:) What place have you always wanted to visit? One, two--\n\nBlubs and Durland: Silly Water Fun Slides in Grand Lakes, Michigan!\n\nCut to Dipper, Mabel, and Trembley outside of the train. Durling and Blubs are on the train wearing Hawaiian shirts and wave to the three as the train departs.\n\nBlubs and Durland: Bye-bye! Bye!\n\nTrembley: (Once the train is gone, he gets to a knee and looks at Mabel) You've done a great service to your country, Mabel. As thanks, I'd like to make you an official U.S. congressman. (Unfolds a black top-hat and hands it to Mabel)\n\nMabel: (Puts on hat) I'm legalizing everything!\n\nTrembley: (To Dipper:) And Roderick,\n\nDipper: Uh- actually- uh-\n\nTrembley: You dear boy are on your way to unlocking the mysteries of this great land. So I'd like you to have my President's Key!\n\nCut to Trembley and the twins later on, back in Gravity Falls. Trembley is telling a story.\n\nTrembley: And then he chased me around and spanked me with a paddle for, like, three hours. Bottom line, George Washington was a jerk.\n\nMabel: A-greed!\n\nCut to Pacifica and her friends watching girls run around a small maypole.\n\nSmabble: (Trips, but saves herself so that she doesn't fall onto the ground) Oh!\n\nPacifica: (To her friends:) Kick her off the team.\n\nPacifica's friends walk away to do as she said. Mabel approaches Pacifica.\n\nMabel: Hey, Pacifica! I uncovered a government conspiracy about the eighth-and-a-half president of the United States! Who's silly now?\n\nPacifica: What? Who is that idiot?\n\nCut to Trembley, who has his fists up and is chasing after a bald eagle.\n\nTrembley: Put up your dukes, you bald fiend!\n\nCut back to Mabel and Pacifica.\n\nMabel: The eighth-and-a-half president of America. How is he still alive? Well, turns out you can hibernate in peanut brittle and it--\n\nPacifica: (Bursts out into laughter) Wow! You really are a sad, dumb little girl. Nice top hat, by the way.\n\nPreston and Priscilla Northwest laugh mockingly.\n\nPreston Northwest: (Laughs) Good one, daughter.\n\nPacifica: Ooh! I see your car is stuck in the mud. (Gets into sedan) Enjoy walking home!\n\nDipper: (To Mabel:) Aren't you gonna tell her about her ate-gray ampa-gray?\n\nMabel: You know what, Dipper? I've got nothing to prove. I've learned to see silly as awesome!\n\nDipper: Well, I haven't learned anything! (Whistles) Hey, Pacifica!\n\nDipper runs to the Northwests' sedan. The car stops and Dipper hands Pacifica the documents on the Northwest cover-up through the window.\n\nDipper: Nathaniel Northwest didn't found Gravity Falls, and your whole family is a sham. Deal with it.\n\nCar drives away, and Pacifica looks out the back window, shocked.\n\nPacifica: What?! Moooom!!!\n\nDipper: (Now back at Mabel's side) Man, revenge is underrated. That felt awesome!\n\nTrembley: Children, I am needed elsewhere. Just know that I'll always be right here... (Pulls out bill) On the negative twelve dollar bill. (Hands Dipper bill)\n\nDipper: (Examines bill) Whoa. This is worthless.\n\nTrembley: It's less than worthless, my boy. Trembley away!\n\nTrembley jumps backwards onto a horse and rides away.\n\nMabel: Where do you think he's going?\n\nDipper: I'm gonna say... off a cliff.\n\nCut to Stan, who is telling the twins the story of his imprisonment.\n\nStan: And then Soos came by and talked to me for like, an hour.\n\nMabel: You've been through so much.\n\nDipper: (Uses President's key to unlock the lock on the stocks and freeing Stan) It works!\n\nStan: (To Mabel:) So what's with the top hat?\n\nMabel: I am a congressman.\n\nStan: Pardon me?\n\nMabel: You are officially pardoned.\n\nDipper and Mabel laugh, to Stan's befuddlement.\n\nStan: Oy! You a never gonna make sense, are you, kid?\n\nMabel: No, I'm not, Grunkle Stan. No, I'm not. Mabel, away! (Jumps backward)\n\nCrashing sound.\n\nMabel: I'm okay!\n\nCut to end tag. Trembley is in a courtroom talking to babies with mustaches wearing top hats.\n\nTrembley: Esteemed gentlemen of the Supreme Court of the United States, I implore you to rethink your decision!\n\nThe babies sit there making cooing noises.\n\nTrembley: Very well. But who would you have replaced me?\n\nBaby: Mama.\n\nTrembley: That old crone?!\n\nBaby: Ba ba ba...\n\nTrembley: Chief Justice Num-Num, y-you're spitting up on yourself! Now ohh! Oh, come on! This is a courtroom! I... this... this is a dark day for America.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/374013", "artist_names": "Artists For Haiti", "full_title": "We Are the World 25 for Haiti by\u00a0Artists\u00a0For Haiti", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/f6c649792c065bfbc877fcd13274d505.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f6c649792c065bfbc877fcd13274d505.600x600x1.jpg", "id": 374013, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 174608, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1619304647, "path": "/Artists-for-haiti-we-are-the-world-25-for-haiti-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 4, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Artists-for-haiti-we-are-the-world-25-for-haiti-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2010, "month": 2, "day": 12}, "release_date_for_display": "February 12, 2010", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 12, 2010", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/f6c649792c065bfbc877fcd13274d505.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f6c649792c065bfbc877fcd13274d505.600x600x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 209452}, "title": "We Are the World 25 for Haiti", "title_with_featured": "We Are the World 25 for Haiti", "updated_by_human_at": 1641487058, "url": "https://genius.com/Artists-for-haiti-we-are-the-world-25-for-haiti-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/383907", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/71dbc13e78303b61d54043edde603106.330x330x1.png", "id": 383907, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/71dbc13e78303b61d54043edde603106.330x330x1.png", "index_character": "a", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Artists For Haiti", "slug": "Artists-for-haiti", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Artists-for-haiti"}, "artist": "Artists For Haiti", "lyrics": "We Are the World 25 for Haiti Lyrics[Verse 1]\nJustin Bieber:\nThere comes a time\nWhen we heed a certain call\n\nNicole Scherzinger & Jennifer Hudson & Justin Bieber:\nWhen the world must come together as one\n\nJennifer Hudson:\nThere are people dying\nJennifer Nettles:\nAnd it's time to lend a hand to life\n\nJennifer Nettles & Josh Groban:\nThe greatest gift of all\n\nJosh Groban:\nWe can't go on\nPretending day by day\n\nTony Bennett:\nThat someone somehow will soon make a change\n\nMary J.

miss you\nPour me a heavy dose of atmosphere\n'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly\nBut I'll miss your arms around me\nI'd send a postcard to you, dear\n'Cause I wish you were here\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'll watch the night turn light blue\nBut it's not the same without you\nBecause it takes two to whisper quietly\nThe silence isn't so bad\n'Til I look at my hands and feel sad\n'Cause the spaces between my fingers\nAre right where yours fit perfectly\nI'll find repose in new ways\nThough I haven't slept in two days\n'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone\nBut drenched in vanilla twilight\nI'll sit on the front porch all night\nWaist-deep in thought because when I think of you\nI don't feel so alone\n[Bridge]\nI don't feel so alone\nI don't feel so alone\nAs many times as I blink, I'll think of you\nTonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)\nI'll think of you tonight\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen violet eyes get brighter\nAnd heavy wings grow lighter\nI'll taste the sky and feel alive again\nAnd I'll forget the world that I knew\nBut I swear I won't forget you\nOh, if my voice could reach back through the past\nI'd whisper in your ear\n\"Oh darling, I wish you were here\"\n\n[Instrumental

Rihanna, Madonna, and Calvin Harris have all turned their profile blue to support streaming service Tidal, which JAY Z recently purchased. The service launches March 30, 2015.\nThe artists are performing a \u2018Coup d'\u00e9tat\u2019 style campaign to overthrow Spotify, on the eve of its rumoured $16B acquisition.\n\n\nMashable.com writes:\nEarlier this year, Jay Z bought Aspiro, a Swedish tech company that runs two streaming music services (WiMP and Tidal) for $56 million. Monday's announcement will finally reveal what the 45-year-old rap mogul will do with his purchase.\n\nTidal's website describes the service as such: \"Introducing the first music streaming service that combines the best High Fidelity sound quality, High Definition music videos and expertly Curated Editorial.\"\n\nConsequenceofsound.com writes:\nA new high-fidelity streaming music service helmed by Jay Z launches Monday. TIDAL was acquired by the rapper last month as part of a $56 million dollar deal with the Scandinavian platform Aspiro.\n\n\nFull details of the service will be announced during a press conference on Monday. However, according to TIDAL\u2019s website, it\u2019s \u201cthe first music streaming service that combines the best High Fidelity sound quality, High Definition music videos and expertly Curated Editorial.\u201d\n\n\nThere are two paid subscription options: $19.99 a month for high-fidelity audio, and $9.99 for standard quality audio. TIDAL can be streamed on the web, and downloaded for iOS and Android devices.\nSeveral artists have already thrown their support behind TIDAL, changing their Twitter icons to light blue and tweeting the hashtag #TIDALForAll. Among them were Kanye West and Jack White\u2019s Third Man Records\nTIDAL joins the ranks of an already crowded streaming music market, which includes Spotify, Rdio, Amazon, Pandora, and Neil Young\u2019s high-fidelity PONO digital store. Additionally, Apple is said to be developing its own service with the assistance of Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor.\n\n\nUSA Today writes:\nMusic mogul Jay Z is expected on Monday to unveil his blueprint for high-resolution music streaming service Tidal.\nA press invite for an event scheduled for Monday went out last week promising that \u201cShawn \u2018JAY Z\u2019 Carter and special guests will announce a commitment to a new direction for the music industry from both a creative and business perspective.\u201d\n\n\nThe hip-hop icon last month made a $56 million bid for the service and parent company Aspiro through Project Panther Bidco Ltd., which is indirectly-owned by his S. Carter Enterprises. The Scandinavian company Aspiro currently operates two music services, Tidal in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and WiMP, in Norway, Sweden and other parts of Europe.\n\n\nThe two services will now be operated under the name Tidal worldwide. The event, which will be live-streamed, will unveil \u201ca new chapter\u201d for the global streaming service.\n\n\nJay Z\u2019s play with Tidal comes at a tumultuous time for the music streaming market. Apple is reportedly revamping its streaming music plan. The tech giant acquired Beats Music last year for $3 billion, but is now planning a new streaming service to better compete with Spotify, The New York Times reported last week.\n\nApple had hoped to undercut Spotify on its $9.99 monthly paid tier of service by $2, but music labels would not agree to Apple\u2019s offer for lower licensing fees, sources told the Times.\n\n\nThis is part of an aggressive move by the major labels, specifically Universal, Sony and Warner Music to limit or close free access streaming, says Paul Resnikoff, publisher of Digital Music News.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve lost faith in the ability of \u2018freemium\u2019 to covert enough paid subscribers, where the real money in streaming comes from,\u201d he said. \u201cThat explains the refusal to allow a free tier on Apple\u2019s upcoming streaming launch, and now, a refusal to even let Apple offer a lower price point.\u201d\n\n\nA reason why the music industry might embrace Jay Z and Tidal? It charges $19.99 monthly for unlimited listening of high resolution music \u2014 with no free listening tier, although you can get a seven-day free trial.\n\n\nTidal\u2019s music quality offerings include 1411 kilobits per second lossless HiFi, which is equivalent to CD sound and considered higher quality than lower resolution levels of Spotify (320 kbps) and iTunes (256 kbps).\n\n\nUsers can access Tidal on Android and iOS devices, computers and some home audio products including Sonos speakers.8Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1007273", "artist_names": "Randy Houser", "full_title": "Anything Goes by\u00a0Randy\u00a0Houser", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c1d8e73e6edaf812492987bc06ee80ea.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c1d8e73e6edaf812492987bc06ee80ea.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 1007273, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1524192363, "path": "/Randy-houser-anything-goes-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Randy-houser-anything-goes-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2008, "month": 6, "day": 2}, "release_date_for_display": "June 2, 2008", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jun. 2, 2008", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c1d8e73e6edaf812492987bc06ee80ea.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c1d8e73e6edaf812492987bc06ee80ea.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Anything Goes", "title_with_featured": "Anything Goes", "updated_by_human_at": 1558706457, "url": "https://genius.com/Randy-houser-anything-goes-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/52310", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d044391041408ab6c6234e819ae511c7.700x318x1.jpg", "id": 52310, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/de24f849189786767a2e23c4cf671fe7.681x681x1.jpg", "index_character": "r", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Randy Houser", "slug": "Randy-houser", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Randy-houser"}, "artist": "Randy Houser", "lyrics": "Anything Goes Lyrics[Verse 1]\nNormally this time of night, you wouldn't find me here\nI'd be reaching for a good night kiss instead of one more beer\nI'd never take a second look at the blond across the bar\nMuch less invite her over and let things go this far\n\n[Chorus]\nBut anything goes, when everything's gone\nYou ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong\nSo bring it on, anything goes, when everything's gone\n[Verse 2]\nAnother morning after, a crazy night before\nI'm searching for my blue jeans on the stranger's bedroom floor\nShouldn't I feel guilty?

the closet\nAnd I'll say I ain't do it\nWith my face covered in chocolate\nMy girl be setting booby traps\nTo catch me eating Scooby Snacks\nI left crumbs in the bed once\nBut I told her I was through

1]\nYeah, put my ego to the side and get to business\nBusy bee I\u2019m chopping beats like David East I\u2019m in OT\nNo Henessey up in the system, sippin tea is more habitual\nI don\u2019t do religion, songs are hardly dirty rituals\nMy ministry ironic I kill beats to preach life\nMinuscule my name but be atomic is the King\u2019s light\nKing\u2019s life, I chase Christ\nReset my whole price\nNow it can\u2019t be paid, but still I make all of my playlists speaking truth in dirty industries\nSurvival costs salvation\nNo race-baiting but slavery outlasted the plantations\nEvil come in different colors, Satan don\u2019t discriminate\nKingdom cash w\u0435 stackin\u2019 numbers, pray to God He el\u0435vate\nMy flow I need a ghost I\u2019m shaking rock like I\u2019m Bambaataa\nGod the Holy Father, ear candy Willy Wonka\nOompa Loompa movin\u2019 under you, now who done moved the title for the greatest truth outside the Bible?\nI\u2019m Malcolm\n[Verse 2]\nX I\u2019m in the middle of the stress between the nations\nLife and death, you practically should strap a vest when you vacation\nPuerto Rico or to poorer choices, it don\u2019t really matter\nNo matter where you go, the Devil tryna get your head up on a platter\nTalkin\u2019 mad and then we fall into the hate\nSo many trigger fingers lying round your confidence at stake\nAny time you voice your thoughts, you are prohibited to state\nWhat\u2019s on your mind don\u2019t really matter cuz it\u2019s difficult to skate\nPast the masters who be faster than a CDC agenda\nTo plaster up the social norms and force you to agendas\nThe masses be like sheep how they flock to different shepherds\nDon\u2019t believe in rules, like Aang, I\u2019m gonna bend em\nBend em backwards, I\u2019m reversing on this wack world\n(Uno)\nAfter this I might just go to Pluto\nCuz this flow is something alien\nET I punch a time sheet I might not be in charge but I make ends meet\nMeet me at the crib and imma show you how I proudly live\nOffa 90, never more cuz 10 percent the least I give\nDo not try me, I been grinding in the lab all summer long\nIf I am not a better version of myself then\u2019s something\u2019s wrong\n\n[Verse 3]\nMaster Wong I make song about the Rock (Barack), no Obama\nBarack I\u2019m bouta blow I been leadin\u2019 (bin Laden) no Osama\nPOTUS I\u2019m a lotus Rest In Peace to Dalai

the whack rappers tryna make a scene\nNo talent but the audience is made up of machines\nI can see behind the smoke screens, shout-out J.

afraid somebody's going to steal you away from me\n\n[Break]\nOoh, suspicions\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen I'm with you I feel so satisfied\nThe way you touch me when you lay by my side\nThat look in your eyes when we make love\nMakes me hate myself for what I'm thinking of\n\n[Chorus]\nI get these suspicions\nEven though I know that you love me baby\nAnd I really shouldn't feel this way\nOoh suspicions\nI

Fire and Flames Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nOn a cold winter morning\nIn the time before the light\nIn flames of Death's eternal reign\nWe ride towards the fight\n\nWhen the darkness has fallen down\nAnd the times are tough, alright\nThe sound of evil laughter falls\nAround the world tonight\nFighting hard, fighting on for the steel\nThrough the wastelands evermore\nThe scattered souls will feel the hell\nBodies wasted on the shores\n\nOn the blackest plains in hell's domain\nWe watch them as they go\nIn fire and pain, now once again we know\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nSo now, we fly ever free, we're free before the thunderstorm\nOn towards the wilderness, our quest carries on\nFar beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight\nDeep inside our hearts and all our souls\n\n[Chorus]\nSo far away, we wait for the day\nFor the lives, all so wasted and gone\nWe feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days\nThrough the fire and the flames, we carry on!\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 2]\nAs the red day is dawning\nAnd the lightning cracks the sky\nThey'll raise their hands to the heavens above\nWith resentment in their eyes\nYou might also likeRunning back through the mid-morning light\nThere's a burning in my heart\nWe're banished from a time in a fallen land\nTo a life beyond the stars\n\nIn your darkest dreams, see to believe\nOur destiny this time\nAnd endlessly we'll all be free tonight\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAnd on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality\nAll alone in desperation, now the time has gone\nLost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind\nDay after day, this misery must go on\n\n[Chorus]\nSo far away, we wait for the day\nFor the lives, all so wasted and gone\nWe feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days\nThrough the fire and the flames, we carry on!\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nWhoa-oh oh, whoa-oh oh, whoa-oh oh oh oh...\nWhoa-oh oh, whoa-oh oh, whoa-oh oh oh oh...\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nNow, here we stand with their blood on our hands\nWe fought so hard now, can we understand?\nI'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can\nFor freedom of every man\n\n[Chorus]\nSo far away, we wait for the day\nFor the lives, all so wasted and gone\nWe feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days\nThrough the fire and the flames, we carry

my heart when they've been broken down\nI know he calls for more forgiveness than most folks do require\nBut he's an angel with no halo and one wing in the fire\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I know he lives a

Rap Songs of 2014 Lyrics100. Ghostface Killah ft. AZ, Kool G Rap &  Tre Williams \"The Battlefield\"\"The Battlefield\" is an amazing portrayal of hip-hop's recent evolution. The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99. Apollo Brown & Rass Kass ft. Pharoahe Monch & Rakaa Iriscience \"H20\"98. Travi$ Scott ft. Big Sean \"Don't Play\"97. Mac Miller ft. Vince Staples \"Rain\"96. Isaiah Rashad ft. SZA \"West Savannah\"95. Vic Mensa\t\"Feel That\"Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year\u2019s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger \"Feel That\". The song breaks away from Vic\u2019s reputation as a \u201clyrical\u201d rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic\u2019s about to take over the game and we feel that!94. Mick Jenkins\tft Joey Bada$$ \"Jerome\"93. Tinashe ft Schoolboy Q \"2 On\"92. Jay Electronica ft. LaTonya Givens \"Better In Tune With The Infinite\"91. Big K.R.I.T. \"King Of The South\"90. PRyhme \"Courtesy\" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino \"Sober\"88. NehruvianDOOM \"OM\"87. Drake\t\"How About Now\"86. Statik Selektah ft Action Bronson, Royce da 5'9 & Black Thought \"The Imperial\"85. O.T Genasis\t\"CoCo\"BAKIN' SODA, I GOT BAKIN' SODA!O.T took the internet by storm with this cocaine ballad. His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj. The biggest fans of this song are O.T's peers - y'all saw what happened to Busta Rhymes, right?84. Vince Staples ft James Fauntleroy \"Nate\"83. Lupe Fiasco ft Ty Dolla $ign \"Deliver\"82. Theophilus London ft Kanye West \"Can't Stop\"81. Future ft. Andre 3000 \"Benz Friends (Whatchutola)\"80. Jay Electronica ft. Jay Z \"We Made It Freestyle\" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy\u2019s 2013 New Year anthem \u201cWe Made It\u201d. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: \u201cSorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought\u201d79. Beyonce ft. Nicki Minaj \"***Flawless Remix\"78. ScHoolboy Q \"Prescription/Oxymoron\"77. Travis Scott ft Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Mamacita\"76. YG ft. Jay Rock & ScHoolboy Q \"I Just Wanna Party\"75. Dej Loaf\t\"Try Me\"From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS\u2019 \u201cTry Me\u201d beat creeps in, Dej commands the year\u2019s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam\u2019ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf\u2019s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs \"Old English\"73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX \"Gotti\"72. Mick Jenkins \"The Waters\"71. Game \"Bigger Than Me\"70. Childish Gambino \"Candler Road\"Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song \u201cTelegraph Ave.\u201d The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan \"Ruckus In B Minor\"68. Kendrick Lamar \"Untitled\"67. OG Maco \"U Guessed It\"66. Drake \"Draft Day\"65. Donnie Trumpet ft. Chance The Rapper & Jamila Woods\t\"Sunday Candy\"The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago \u201csymphony\u201d, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it\u2019s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper\u2019s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q \"Hoover Street\"63. Common ft. Vince Staples \"Kingdom\"62. Jay Rock \"Parental Advisory\"61. Freddie Gibbs \"Shitsville\"60. Action Bronson \"Easy Rider\"The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like \u201cI had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin\u201d are classic Bam Bam. \"Easy Rider\" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem\t\"Shady XV\"58. Nicki Minaj \"Anaconda\"57. J.Cole \"January 28th\"56. Run The Jewels ft. boots \"Early\"55. Mac Miller \"Diablo\"Mac hit us with \u201cDiablo\u201d  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like \u201cContemplating suicide like it\u2019s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it\u2019s a prison homie leave me be\u201d. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs \"Harold's\"53. Slaughterhouse \"Y'all Ready Know\"52. Logic \"Nikki\"51. Yelawolf \"Till It's Gone\"50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought \"Rapid Eye Movement\"From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. \"My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga\" starts us off with a bang. \"Rapid Eye Movement\" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake \"Recognize\"48. Vic Mensa \"Down On My Luck\"47. PRyhme\t\"PRyhme\"46. Vince Staples \"Blue Suede\"45. Rae Sremmurd\t\"No Flex Zone\"Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne \"Only\" 43. Joey Bada$$\t\"Big Dusty\"42. Run The Jewels \"Blockbuster Night Pt. 1\"41. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Cadillactica\"40. Pusha T \"Lunch Money\"What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push\u2019s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like \u201cWhat's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef\u201d. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013\u2019s MNIMN, he won\u2019t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake \"Who Do You Love\"38. Freddie Gibbs \"Deeper\"37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt \"New Faces V2\"36. Rae Sremmurd \"No Type\"35. Isaiah Rashad \"Heavenly Father\"Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa \"We Dem Boyz\"33. J.Cole \"No Role Modelz\"32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T \"Move That Dope\"31. Logic \"Soul Food\"30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick \"Detroit Vs Everybody\" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em\u2019s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar \"Pay For It\"28. Nas \"The Season\"27. Bad Meets Evil \"Vegas\"26. Logic \"Gang Related\"25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown \"High\"Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug \"About The Money\"23. Drake \"6 God\"22. Eminem ft. Sia \"Guts Over Fear\"21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  \"Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)\"20. Mick Jenkins \"Jazz\" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z \"Seen It All\"Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West \"Sanctified\"Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, \"Sanctified\" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith.\n\nNot only did \"Sanctified\" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake \"Tuesday (Remix)\"I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto \u201cTuesday\u201d and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole \t\"Wet Dreamz\"Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake \"Believe Me\" The release of \"Believe Me\"  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion\n\nOne of the more underrated aspects of \"Believe Me\"  is its versatility. You can bump it while you\u2019re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q \"Break tHe Bank\"Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J \"Multiply\"After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in \"Multiply.\" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn\u2019t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP\u2019s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year\u2019s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar \"Never Catch Me\"Like a psychedelic rat race, \u201cNever Catch Me\u201d  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick\u2019s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - \u201cbitch, you\u2019re dead!\u201d11. Joey Bada$$ \"Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)\"With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey\u2019s ability and shows he ain\u2019t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won\u2019t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels \"Oh My Darling Don't Cry\" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to \u201crun backwards through a field of dicks\u201d as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug \"Lifestyle\" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan\u2019s \u201cone-hit wonder status\u201d and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid \"Studio\"ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole \"Fire Squad\"If shock factor was what Cole was after with \"Fire Squad\" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda \"Hot Nigga\"The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn\u2019t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic \"Under Pressure\"The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic\u2019s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track\u2019s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 \"I Don't Fuck With You\"Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with \u201cParadise\u201d, \u201c4th Quarter\u201d, and \u201cJit/Juke\" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples \u201cSay You Love Me\u201d, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not \"down with\" and is reminiscent of \u201cI Don\u2019t Give A Fuck\u201d from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still\u2026.Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.\t\"Mt. Olympus\"Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. \"Mt. Olympus\" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, \"Is he rap, is he snap?\". \"Is he bass, is he drank?\" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake \"0-100/The Catch Up\"If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. \"Started from the bottom, now we here\" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but \"0 to 100 nigga, real quick\" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release\n\nThe two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes \"0 to 100/The Catch Up\" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought. We've already begun to see Drake back up these claims in his latest releases, and it's safe to say the anticipation for his next full-length project is nearly off the charts.1. Kendrick Lamar \"i\"Backed by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music, Kendrick broadcasts a message of self love.  The best messages are those easily understood, and Kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple \"I love myself\"\n\nSimilar to our number one song last year, Kanye West's \"New Slaves\", every facet of the song\u2019s concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move. Whether it be the record, the music video, or the buzz - each element illustrates the message crystal clear. An anthem isn't created overnight, this song has been in Kendrick all his life. They can lock ya body, they can\u2019t trap ya mind.\n\n163Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 7, "api_path": "/songs/45009", "artist_names": "The Game", "full_title": "Let's Ride by\u00a0The\u00a0Game", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/088e359b0fe47a69678615a8f3d54c8e.300x298x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/088e359b0fe47a69678615a8f3d54c8e.600x596x1.jpg", "id": 45009, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 6914, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1659716091, "path": "/The-game-lets-ride-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 10, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-game-lets-ride-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2006, "month": 9, "day": 25}, "release_date_for_display": "September 25, 2006", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Sep. 25, 2006", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/baf98ef291b5b542319cf0566fd70b6c.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/baf98ef291b5b542319cf0566fd70b6c.300x300x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 3, "hot": false, "pageviews": 54257}, "title": "Let\u2019s Ride", "title_with_featured": "Let's Ride", "updated_by_human_at": 1659716091, "url": "https://genius.com/The-game-lets-ride-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/42", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5862783a10f54de5c61799bc3b4ff207.1000x428x1.jpg", "id": 42, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/23a3ca8df26e9dea38634304ba6d972f.596x596x1.png", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "The Game", "slug": "The-game", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-game", "iq": 1201}, "artist": "The Game", "lyrics": "Let\u2019s Ride Lyrics[Verse 1]\nPull the rag off the six-fo'\nHit the switch, show niggas how the shit go\nThe Game is back, the Aftermath chain is gone\nThe Ds is chrome, the frame is black (So watch it lift up)\n'Til the motherfucker bounce and break\nAnd knock both of the screws out the licence plate\nLet the games begin\nThese other rap niggas so far behind me could taste my rims\nShit, let the chronic burn as the Daytons spin\nIt ain\u2019t been this much drama since I first heard Eminem\nIn the club, poppin' X pills like M&Ms\nCall it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend\nBottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round\nAnd put that cheap-ass Hypnotic down (Put your \u2018cris up!)\nIf you feel the same way\nWho got 'em hittin' switches NY to LA\n[Chorus]\n(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)\nHop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back\n(I turn it into a strip-club)\nCall it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass\n(If I could fit the whole world in the club)\nTell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch\n(Pop bottles and twist up)\nRoll up chronic and hash\nIn a blunt, call it Aftermath\n\n[Verse 2]\nSomebody tell me where the drinks at, where the bitches at\nYou fuckin' on the first night, meet me in the back\nI got a pound of chronic, and a gang of freaks\nMove bitch!
