WAYNE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nALFRED PENNYWORTH, the Wayne family butler, fluffs up a cushion in the\nlarge, elegant living room.  A kind-looking man in his late forties\nwith dark moustache and hair, he epitomizes the proper British moor\ndomo, dressed in a morning coat and striped vest.\n\nAlfred turns, straightens up a pile of thick-looking papers on the\nliving room table.  He picks up the top one, looks at it critically,\nbut with satisfaction.\n\nINSERT SHOT - CAMPAIGN POSTER\n\nThe thick-looking papers are, in fact, political campaign posters.\nThey feature the face of a handsome, fortyish man, with the block\nlettered caption: DR. THOMAS WAYNE FOR CITY COUNCIL - A BETTER TOMORROW\nFOR GOTHAM.\nDR. WAYNE'S VOICE\nBruce?  Hurry up, son, we're going\nto be late.  Martha?\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nAlfred turns to look at DR. THOMAS WAYNE (the man on the poster) enters\nthe room.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nNow where's Martha?  Alfred, have\nyou seen Mrs. Wayne?\n\nALFRED\nI believe she was headed for Master\nBruce's laboratory. Sir.\n\nDr. Wayne checks his watch, exits, muttering.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nThat nymphomaniacal hamster of his\nmust have given birth again...\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\nDr. Wayne heads down the hallway towards a door.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nCome on, everybody, the movie starts\nin less than an hour.  Let's not\nkeep you next city councilman\nwaiting...\n\nINT. BRUCE'S LAB\n\nDr. Wayne opens the door.  The makeshift lab room has a large work\ntable crammed with beakers, test tubes, and other scientific equipment.\nBRUCE WYANE, aged ten, sits behind a microscope, peers down intently at\na specimen on a slide.  He does not look up as his father enters.\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(crossing)\nSon, whatever you're looking at\ncouldn't possible be as pretty as\nAudrey Hepburn, so...\n\nDr. Wayne puts his hand on Bruce's shoulder.  Incredibly enough - it\npasses right through it!  He recoils, shocked, reaches out to touch the\nbody's head.  His hand cuts right through the skull.  Giggling is\nHEARD, O.S.\n\nYoung Bruce stands behind the door with his mother, MARTHA, a beautiful\nwoman in her mid-thirties.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's called a \"holograph,\" dad.  Two\nInterconnecting laser beams...\n(pointing)\nThere and there.  Pretty neat, huh?\n\nDr. Wayne stares at the laser tubes, totally nonplussed.\n\nMARTHA\nWell, don't look at me.  My side\nof the family still can't figure out\nwhy it gets dark at night.  Ready to\ngo?\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(eyes narrowing)\nHow can I be sure you're the real\nthing?\n\nMartha kisses him warmly.  He looks back, impressed.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nSomewhat lifelike, I'll admit...\n\nMARTH\nThat's all?  Then hold on to your\nsocks, buster...\n\nShe kisses him again with passion.  Bruce turns away with the typical\nself-consciousness of a pre-adolescent.\n\nBRUCE\nOh, guy...\n\nHis parents break.  Dr. Wayne looks down at him.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nBruce, you may be the brightest ten\nyear old in Gotham City, or any-\nwhere else, for that matter.  But I\nfeel I ought to let you in on some-\nthing.\n(at Martha)\nThis - is definitely not a guy.\n\nINT. PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT\n\nA huge 35mm motion picture projector springs to life.\n\nINT. THEATER\n\nThe shifting colored rays of a projected film knife though the\nblackness of the theater.\n\nSCREEN VOICE\nSister, you make a beautiful nun.\n\nANGLE ON MOVIE SCREEN\n\nThe screen is filled by the face of AUDREY HEPBURN, dressed as a nun.\nWe are watched The Nun's Story, as are:\n\nANGLE ON WAYNE FAMILY IN SEATS\n\nDr. Wayne, Martha, and Bruce, who downs the remains of his box of Good\nand Plenty.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MOVIE THEATER & STREET - NIGHT\n\nRumblings of distant thunder echo through the night sky.  The Wayne\nfamily exits the theater, heads down a deserted street.  Suddenly - a\nflash of lightning.  A closer, louder clap of thunder.  Dr. Wayne takes\nMartha's arm.  Bruce straggles behind, staring at the pavement.\n\nDR. WAYNE\nI wish I hadn't parked so far away.\nWe're going to get soaked.\n\nMARTHA\n(over her shoulder)\nDo try and keep up, Bruce.  What on\nearth are you staring at, anyway?\n\nBRUCE\nThe cracks, Mom.  It's bad luck to\nstep on one.\n(does so)\nOh, darnit...\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nHold it, you people.  Freeze!\n\nA large man (JOE CHILL) partially hidden by shadows, points a gun at\nthem.  He stands in the sunken entrance to a deserted brownstone house,\ngestures with his weapon.\n\nCHILL\nGet down in here.  Now.\n\nMARTHA\n(terrified)\nThomas...\n\nDR. WAYNE\nYou're welcome to our money.  Any-\nthing we have.  Okay?\n\nChill stares coldly.  Dr. Wayne pulls out his money, takes off his\nwatch.  Martha and Bruce watch, petrified.\n\nDR. WAYNE (CONT'D)\nHere...just be careful with that\ngun, will you?  It could go off...\n\nCHILL\nYou know something, Doc?  You're\nright.\n\nDR. WAYNE\n(expression changing)\nDoc?  How did you know I was a...\n\nThere is a deafening roar as Chill fires the gun, lifting Dr. Wayne off\nhis feet, hurling him backwards.\n\nBRUCE\nDaddy!!\n\nMartha screams.  A bolt of lightning flashes.  Chill turns.\n\nCHILL\nLet's have that necklace, lady...\n\nMARTHA\nOh, my God!\n\nMartha tries to escape but is jerked back by Chill's hand as it closes\non her necklace.  Bruce runs at Chill, grabs him by the leg, tries to\npull him down.\n\nBRUCE\nLeave my mommy alone!  Mommy!\nMommy!\n\nChill fires again!  The necklace snaps free as Martha is jerked\nbackwards, then crumples next to her husband.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nHe kneels over his mother's body, pauses in shock, then looks up: the\nbarrel of Chill's gun comes into frame.\n\nCLOSE ON CHILL\n\nThe necklace in one hand, his gun in the other.  He looks down at\nBruce, his expression suddenly changing.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHe stares at Chill, his jaw inadvertently twitching with rage.  A LOUD\nCLAP OF THUNDER rolls across the sky.  Bruce's eyes have become steel,\nvisible fury shooting forth from them in an almost demonic fashion.\n\nChill's gun hand suddenly starts to tremble.  Incredibly, the savage\nface of this young boy has unnerved him.\n\nCHILL\nStop...lookin' at me like that, kid...\n(no response)\nStop looking at me like that!\n\nSuddenly - A FLASH OF LIGHTNING!  Rain begins to fall in sheets.\nChill, runs up to the street, disappears into the rain-swept darkness.\n\nANGLE ON APARTMENT BUILDING\n\nLIGHTS have flicked on in the apartment building across the street.\nFACELESS WITNESSES stand silhouetted in the windows, gazing down at the\ntragedy across the street.\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN on one particular window.  A SHADOWY FIGURE half-\nemerges from the darkness, his face still hidden from us.  All that is\nvisible is an oversized pair of striped pants and a large white daisy\nstuck through the coat lapel.  The Shadowy Figure pauses, then reaches\nout an arm and slowly lowers the window shade.\n\nFrom behind the shade - an insane, maniacal giggle starts to rise.\nTiny at first, but gradually building to a sudden explosion of\ncascading, frightening glee!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nKneeling in the rain across the street, paralyzed with shock and grief.\nHe looks up from the bodies of his parents as a COUPLE approaches along\nthe pavement above.\n\nBRUCE'S VOICE\nHelp...oh, please help me...\n\nThe couple stop, stare down at the scene.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's...my mom and dad.  Please...I\nthink they're dead.\n\nThe couple exchange a quick, horrified glance, then hurry off down the\nstreet.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nSobbing uncontrollably now, tears mixing with the rain.  In the\ndistance: the low whine of an approaching siren.  CAMERA RISES into the\nnight sky:\n\nA FLASHING BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS ACROSS THE SCREEN: the residue\nremains in the night sky - a searing yellow dot.  ANOTHER BOLT OF\nLIGHTNING - another yellow dot.  Then a deafening clap of thunder as\nthe gray-black clouds arrange themselves into a dark and eerie\nsilhouette.  The siren grows louder, piercing shrilly through the\nrumblings of the storm.  The SILHOUETTE becomes more familiar now, as\nthe billowing clouds form themselves into a dark cape.  The dots of\nlightning begin to pulsate as they evolve into two searing yellow eyes.\n\nThis then, is the signal of the future presence of the Dark Redeemer of\nthe Night.  The Black Wraith.  The Avenger of Countless Wrongs...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t THE BATMAN\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE\nTHROUGH TO:\n\nEXT. HILLSIDE CEMETERY NEAR GOTHAM - DAY\n\nA beautiful rolling hill overlooking Gotham City.  As CAMERA TRACKS\nthrough the trees, tombstones begin to appear.  We are in the middle of\nan immaculate pastoral graveyard.  Down below in the distance an\nendless line of black limousines snakes its way up a winding road.\nCAMERA CONTINUES TO TRACK, finally HOLDING ON:\n\nThe unfilled graves of Thomas and Martha Wayne.  Dark-suited FUNERAL\nATTENDANTS wait silently by the caskets.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM CITY - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT\n\nA hot sun showers a blazing glow on the throbbing metropolis of Gotham\nCity, choked with cars, buses, PEDESTRIANS, and the attendant\npollution.  A great American city going through the routine\nperformances of its daily mundane chores.\n\nEXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY\n\nCAMERA CLOSE on an oversized pair of striped pants standing in front of\na corner newsstand.\n\nVOICE\nA copy of the Trib, please.\n\nCLOSE ON GOTHAM TRIBUNE\n\nAn edition of the Gotham Tribune is handed over.  The headlines scream:\nDR. & MRS. THOMAS WAYNE GUNNED DOWN IN SENSELESS ROBBERY/KILLING.\n\"Political hopeful was well ahead in latest polls.\"\n\nAn insane giggle rises, O.S.  CAMERA PANS UP from the front page to the\nhorrified face of a NEWS VENDOR, staring in disbelief at the person\nreading the Tribune.\n\nCLOSE ON JOKER - HIS P.O.V.\n\nWe see the hideous face of THE JOKER.  A revolting perversion of a\nhuman being with a chalk-white complexion, ruby red lips, and a\nstartling shock of green hair.  He continues to giggle as he reads.  A\nCONFEDERATE stands behind.  The Vendor continues to stare as The Joker\nsuddenly notices.\n\nJOKER\nSomething wrong?\n\nVENDOR\nYour...face.  It's...\n\nJOKER\nFamiliar?  Maybe we met in Toledo.\n\nVENDOR\nI never been to Toledo.\n\nJOKER\nNeither have I.  Must have been two\nother guys.\n(taking one out)\nHave a cigar?\n\nVENDOR\nGee, thanks.\n\nThe Vendor takes the cigar, lights it.  The Joker and his Confederate\nmove off down the street.\n\nJOKER\nWant to hear a good one?  What's\nblack and white and dead all over?\n\nCONFEDERATE\nA newspaper, Boss, but ain't it\nblack and white and read all over?\n\nSuddenly - there is a tremendous explosion!\n\nANGLE ON CORNER NEWSSTAND\n\nThe corner newsstand has virtually disappeared.  Thousands of pages\ndrift down through the air into the debris.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nNo...\n\nEXT. HILLSIDE CEMETERY - DAY\n\nThe procession of limousines has started back down the hill from the\nfuneral.  Alfred stands alone by a black Rolls Royce, looks off sadly\nas:\n\nYoung Bruce Wayne gently places a flower on each of his parent's\ngraves, then turns.  His eyes are glassed over, but tears do not fall.\nHe crosses to Alfred who puts a protective arm around him.\n\nALFRED\nIt's unfair, of course.  But some-\ntimes, Master Bruce, one simply has\nto...accept conditions as they are,\nand...make the best of them.\n\nBRUCE\n(softly)\nWhy?\n\nALFRED\nWhy?  Why, because...\n(nice smile)\nI don't know, really.\n\nBRUCE\n(deadly)\nNeither do I.\n\nAlfred helps the boy into the car.  The Rolls Royce heads back down the\nhill toward Gotham City.\n\nINT.

CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\nA throng of REPORTERS and TV remote units snap to attention as Thorne\nappears on the steps of his campaign headquarters.  He silences a\ncacophony of overlapping questions with upraised hands, terminally\nsincere.\n\nTHORNE\nI didn't want to win like this.  Not\nthrough tragedy.  But it's cruelly\nironic...\n\nEXT. GOTHAM - DAY\n\nA more downbeat section of Gotham's business district.  CAMERA CLOSES\non a specific building: The Monarch Playing Card Company.  THORNE'S\nVOICE CONTINUES OVER:\n\nTHORNE'S VOICE\n...that a good man like Thomas Wayne\nwho spoke up so forcefully for the\nrights of criminals should himself\nbecome the ultimate victim.\n\nINT. JOKER'S LAIR - DAY\n\nA huge room, garishly decorated in a clown motif.  The wallpaper is one\ncontiguous deck of cards.  There are harlequin chairs, jesters, and\nopen Jack-In-The-Box, etc.\n\nA MAN sits in a chair at the end of the room, facing away from CAMERA.\nHe watches Thorne on a TV set.\n\nTHORNE\n(from TV)\nBut his murderer will be caught and\nexecuted, I promise you!  It's time\nthe scum of our society see that we\nmean to have law and order on the\nstreets of Gotham City!\n\nSuddenly - the set goes mute.  The Man in the chair swivels around\nslowly: It is JOE CHILL!\n\nThe Joker stands at the entrance to the room, lowers a remote control\nbox.  He grins at Chill.  Chill stares back nervously, clearly\nfrightened by The Joker's maniacal presence.\n\nCHILL\nI was...headed for the airport.\nThey said you wanted to see me.\nSomething...wrong?\n\nJOKER\nWrong?  I thought we'd celebrate.  I\nthought you'd like to join me in a\ndrink.\n\nCHILL\n(visibly relieved)\nWhy not...\n\nThe Joker leads him to a table, suddenly glowers darkly.\n\nJOKER\nYou know, I'm disappointed in you,\nJoe.  Very disappointed.\n\nCHILL\n(swallowing)\nYou...are?\n\nJOKER\nI said, \"Would you like to join me\nin a drink.\"  Then you're supposed\nto say, \"Sure there'll be room\nenough for both of us?\"\n(giggle)\nGet it?\n(louder giggle)\n\"Room enough...\"\n\nCHILL\nYeah...sure...I get it now...\n\nJOKER\nYou're a quick study, Joe.\n\nThe Joker claps him on the back as they sit at the table.  The\nConfederate enters with two glasses on a tray.  One contains a clear\nliquid.  The other - a bilious, thick yellow concoction.  The Joker\nedges it across the table toward Chill who eyes it suspiciously.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nDrink up.\n\nChill examines the yellow liquid, wary.\n\nCHILL\nHow come...you ain't drinkin' this...\n\nJOKER\nGood question.  I like lemonade...\n\nHe takes it from Chill, hands him the clear liquid.  They both down\ntheir drinks.  The Joker giggles insanely.\n\nCHILL\nWhat's...so funny...?\n\nJOKER\nMan walks into a doctor's office,\nsays, \"Are you the doctor's nurse?\"\nshe says, \"Yes.\"  He says, \"Oh, is\nthe doctor sick?\"\n\nThe Joker slams the table in glee, out of control.\n\nCHILL\nNo offense, Joker, but that's not\nvery...\n\nChill stops.  The corners of his mouth twitch, then rise involuntarily.\nHe snickers.  Again.  Starts to giggle.  The Joker's eyes narrow.  His\nsmile becomes cruel.\n\nJOKER\nThe doctor says, \"I can sure you.  The\ndisease is hereditary.\"  The patient\nsays, \"Then send the bill to my father.\"\n\nChill instantly explodes with laughter!\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nHe says, \"Help me, Doctor, I've got\namnesia.\"  Doctor says, \"How long\nhave you had it?\"  He says, \"How\nlong have I had what?\"\n\nChill is on his feet now, convulsed in glee.  He sinks to his knees,\nout of control, then collapses on the floor.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nAnd this one will kill you!  I just got\nback from a pleasure trip.  I drove my\nmother-in-law to the airport...\n\nCLOSE ON CHILL\n\nDead.  His mouth frozen in a grotesque grin.  The Joker stares down\nblankly.\n\nJOKER\nBut seriously, folks...\n\nHe looks off, presses the remote control box, activates the sound on\nthe television again.\n\nCLOSE ON TV\n\nRupert Thorne leans in with an oily look.\n\nTHORNE ON TV\nIn the meantime, our hearts go out\nto the Wayne family, particularly to\ntheir young son, Bruce...\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nWatching Thorne.  His face twists into a cruel smile.\n\nTHORNE\n(thoughtful pause)\nAnd I'd like to think that one day\nThomas Wayne will look down on this\nearth and this city and say...\n\nAs Thorne and The Joker speak simultaneously.\n\nTHORNE & JOKER\n\"You know what?

He\ngazes at the impressive array.\n\nALFRED\nOne hardly knows where to begin.\n\nBRUCE\nThose rings seem simple enough.\n\nBruce crosses to the rings, leaps, catches hold, tries to hoist himself\nup.  His eyes bulge!  He tries again, then drops to the floor in a\nheap.\n\nALFRED\nPerhaps if we lowered them.\n\nBRUCE\n(grim stare)\nIf you'll excuse me now, Alfred.\nI'll see you at dinner.\n\nALFRED\nYes, Sir.\n\nAlfred leaves, closing the door.  Bruce turns, glares up at the rings\nlike deadly enemies.  He jumps again, catches hold, starts to hoist\nhimself up, straining with the effort.  The veins standing out on his\nforehead.  Slowly, painfully, he begins to inch himself higher and\nhigher.\n\nINT KARATE STUDIO - DAY\n\nBruce is dressed in a martial arts outfit, tensely faces a thick pine\nboard being held by a Japanese INSTRUCTOR.\n\nINSTRUCTOR\n...but you must believe, really\nbelieve you can do it.  The mind\nis more powerful than the fist, and\nthe fist is more powerful than the\nboard.  Understood?\n\nBruce nods earnestly, sets himself.  With a blood-curdling SCREAM -- he\nlashes out!  Then - an instantaneous second SCREAM as his fist crumples\nagainst the unyielding board.\n\nINSTRUCTOR (CONT'D)\nLet's go over it again...\n\nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - SUNRISE\n\nA tree-lined winding road at dawn.  Bruce jogs along easily, his right\nhand encased in a plaster cast.  Jogging next to him, huffing and\npuffing: an exhausted FRENCH PROFESSOR.\n\nBRUCE\nI am happy...\n\nFRENCH PROFESSOR\n(panting)\nJe suis heureux...\n\nBRUCE\nJe suis heureux...to make your\nacquaintance.\n\nFRENCH PROFESSOR\n(gasping)\nDe...faire votre connaissance...\n\nBRUCE\nDe faire votre connaissance...\n\nBruce looks ahead toward a bend in the road.  Alfred stands by the\nRolls Royce, checking his watch.  The spent Professor peels off to the\nside as Bruce continues on.\n\nBRUCE\nMerci, mon Professeur!  Tommorrow at\nSix again, okay?\n\nThe Professor manages a feeble wave, collapses by the side of the road\nin front of Alfred who administers a thermos of hot coffee and a\ncroissant to the stricken man.\n\nANGLE AROUND OTHER SIDE OF BEND.\n\nAnother jogger has joined Bruce around the bend - an older man, his\nbearded RUSSIAN PROFESSOR.\n\nBRUCE\nDobroye utro, Boris...I am happy...\n\nBORIS\nOchen priyatno...\n\nBRUCE\nOchen priyatno...To make your\nacquaintance.\n\nBORIS\nVam...poznakomit...\n\nThe two of them jog off into the distance.\n\nBORIS' VOICE\n(already winded)\nBozhe moy!...\n\nEXT.

EXERCISE ROOM - DAY\n\nBruce is on the rings again.  By now using them with considerable\nexpertise, swinging his body in somersaults, then performing the\ndifficult \"Iron Cross\" maneuver.  He pauses at full extension, then\nswings back, launches himself towards the parallel bars.\n\nCatching the bars expertly, he performs a complicated routine, pausing\nat the top to look across the room:\n\nA thin balance beam sits below, ten feet away.\n\nBruce swings back one more time on the upper parallel bar, then flies\nthrough the air for the beam!  His feet land on top for one split,\ntenuous second.  He teeters - then crashes heavily to the floor.\nShaking his head to clear the cobwebs, he stares back at the beam,\ndetermined.\n\nEXT.

A thick rope encircles the\nchimney of Wayne Manor as Bruce makes his way up the structure, hand\nover hand.  Suddenly:  the old brick chimney STARTS TO CRUMBLE!  The\nrope jerks free as bricks fly everywhere and Bruce tumbles heavily down\nto the lawn at Alfred'' feet.\n\nBruce looks up, grins sheepishly.  Alfred glances back up at the\ndemolished chimney, then back down at Bruce again.\n\nALFRED\nSanta will be heartbroken.\n\nINT. KARATE STUDIO - DAY\n\nA TERRIFYING SCREAM!  A PINE BOARD is smashed to smithereens by a\nlightning-quick fist!\n\nBruce wheels to FACE CAMERA.  HE IS NOW SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD.  Cool,\nclear eyes flick in the opposite direction as:\n\nTwo STUDENTS charge him!  He flips one over his head, flips the other\nwhile simultaneously spinning around to face the Instructor who closes\nranks from behind.\n\nThe fight is furiously expert - hands and feet working like windmills.\nBruce is parrying every thrust the\nInstructor has to offer, countering every move, but is nonetheless\nbeing backed into a corner.\n\nThe Instructor moves in for the kill as Bruce suddenly vaults up and\nover him in a seven-foot backflip!  Grabbing the man's black belt from\nbehind for leverage, he hoists the Instructor over his head, then sends\nthe bewildered man flying through the air, crashing onto the mat in a\nheap.\n\nBruce looks over, suddenly concerned.  He holds the Instructor's black\nbelt in his hands.  The Instructor is half-dazed, in some pain.  His\neyes suddenly pop open - he grins broadly back at Bruce.\n\nINSTRUCTOR\nThat's okay.

Alfred relaxes in an easy chair, reading an edition of the\nGotham Tribune.\n\nThe headline screams:  JOKER STEALS KALAHARI DIAMOND - Master of Mirth\nStrikes Again.\n\nAlfred puts down the paper, stifling a yawn.  He hears A MUTED VOICE\nfrom upstairs, rises curiously.\n\nINT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nBruce is spread-eagled on the bed, fully clothed - fast asleep.  A\nVOICE drones from a bedside tape recorder.\n\nTAPE VOICE\nAn atom with a magnetic dipole ex-\nposed to a nonuniform magnetic field\nundergoes a linear force in addition\nto its tendency toward orientation...\n\nAlfred stops in the doorway with a sympathetic look.\n\nTAPE VOICE (CONT'D)\nThe use of an atomic beam makes\npossible an observation of an\ninduced transition...\n\nAlfred switches off the tape, adjusts a quilted coverlet over Bruce\nwith a paternal smile.\n\nINT. EXERCISE ROOM - DAY\n\nCAMERA PANS past the balancing beam, parallel bars, and exercise rings\nto Bruce, who faces them confidently, but this time with a big\ndifference - HE IS BLINDFOLDED.  He takes a tentative step forward,\ngauging his distance, then leaps up into the air - grabbing the rings\nwith perfect accuracy!  He performs a series of difficult routines with\nclockwork precision, then swings through the air to the parallel bars,\nlatching on to the lower one, then propelling himself up to the higher\none.  His gyrations become faster, gaining speed and momentum.\nSuddenly - he launches himself toward the balance beam!\n\nBruce lands on the end of the beam like a cat - keeping his balance,\nhaving calculated the exact distance to the inch.  He steps forward\nwith total security, travels the length of the beam with the ease of a\npedestrian.  Reaching the end, he does a complete forward somersault,\nlands solidly on his feet.  Bruce removes his blindfold, stares back at\nthe path he's just taken, amazed by himself.\n\nALFRED'S VOICE\nIncredible!\n\nBruce turns.  A proud Alfred beams from the doorway.\n\nALFRED\nWhy, you were blind as a bat, Sir.\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN on Bruce's grinning face as WE HEAR:\n\nPRINCIPAL'S VOICE\n...many talented, successful gradu-\nates of Gotham High, but none like\nthis young man.

Bruce rises in his cap and gown, makes his way to the\nrostrum.  A confident presence glows behind his clear eyes.  A self-\nassuredness without ego.  A natural grace which exudes the maturity of\na man twice his age.  CAMERA PANS TO the figure of Alfred, who beams\nwith pride.\n\nBRUCE\nThank you, Principal Peters.  Fellow\nstudents, welcome parents, honored\nfaculty and guests...\n\nEXT. BACK FO SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY\n\nBruce hurries down the steps in his black cap and gown, diploma in\nhand.

Marshall McLuhan is\ngiving a talk at the University.\n\nCINDY\nBruce...\n\nHe turns.  Cindy looks at him shyly, then moves closer.\n\nCINDY (CONT'D)\nI...hope you don't mind me saying\nthis, Bruce, but...well, I guess all\nthe girls feel the same way...\n\nBRUCE\nFeel...?\n\nCINDY\nIt's just that everybody thinks\nyou're great...great looking and\neverything...but you never seem to\nhave time for any...fun.\n\nBRUCE\nFun?  What...kind of fun?\n\nCindy stares into his eyes with a mixture of hunger and innocence.  She\nleans in, kisses him softly and deeply on the mouth.  Bruce's eyes\nbulge with surprise, then slowly flutter shut.  They finally break.\n\nCINDY\n(passionate whisper)\n275...7634...\n\nBruce smiles, slides by, heads down the steps.  Cindy watches\nwistfully.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM STREETS - DAY\n\nThe Rolls Royce makes its way through the crowded streets.\n\nINT. ROLLS ROYCE - DAY\n\nBruce stares out the window.

Tonight, Marshall\nMcLuhan lectures at...\n\nAlfred stops.  Bruce is lost in another world.\n\nALFRED (CONT'D)\nAre you all right, Sir?\n\nBRUCE\nHmm?\n\nBruce turns from the window.  Alfred notices something.\n\nALFRED\nIs that blood on your lip?\n\nBruce frowns curiously.  He wipes his lip with his finger, then licks\nit thoughtfully.\n\nBRUCE\nLipstick.\n\nALFRED\n(shocked)\nLipstick?\n\nBRUCE\nLipstick.\n\nAlfred smiles uncomfortably.  The Rolls stops at a light.

GOTHAM COURTHOUSE - DAY\n\nA throng a REPORTERS waits with a predominantly FEMALE CROWD at the\nentrance to Gotham Courthouse.\n\nBruce suddenly appears in the Courthouse doorway as a LOUD CHEER rises\nfrom the Female Crowd.  He elbows his way through them, Alfred at his\nside.  FLASHBULBS POP!  The Women scream and reach out at him, trying\nto tear off a souvenir.  REPORTERS yell overlapping questions.\n\nBRUCE\nSorry, no comment.  Sorry...\n\nALFRED\n(at hysterical Woman)\nMadame, do try to compose yourself...\n\nThey reach the sidewalk and the car.

APARTMENT STREET - NIGHT\n\nBruce crosses the street to a gleaming Aston-Martin sportscar.  ANOTHER\nTHUNDER CLAP!  Rain falls as he reaches into the car, takes out a\ntopcoat and hat.  He starts to pull the convertible top up, glances\ndown the street:\n\nPEOPLE scurry to avoid the rain.  Down the block, across the street, a\nCOUPLE with a YOUNG DAUGHTER look over nervously as a tough-looking\nBIKER on a huge Harley-Davidson rolls up parallel to them on the\nstreet.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nAdjusting the convertible top.  Looking off again.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE'S P.O.V.\n\nSuddenly:  the Biker hops the curb in front of the Family!  Pulling a\ngun, he herds them back into a dark alleyway.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nEyes narrowing.  His jaw twitches.  A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT!  Bruce\nexplodes across the street for the alleyway.\n\nAs Bruce arrives:  the Young Girl bursts out screaming, runs past him.\nBruce hesitates, then runs inside the alley.\n\nANGLE IN ALLEYWAY\n\nThe Man lies in the alley, being cradled by the Woman.  Blood oozes\nfrom the side of his head Bruce arrives.\n\nWOMAN\nI...think he'll be all right.  Our\ndaughter's run to call an ambulance.\n\nBruce hears the REVVING of a motorcycle.  He looks off down the alley,\neyes flashing with anger.\n\nANGLE DOWN ALLEY - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe Biker grins at him from the far end of the alley, puts his Harley\nin gear, rolls off through the pouring rain.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHe makes his decision, takes off in pursuit.\n\nWOMAN\nCareful!  He's got a gun!\n\nEXT. END OF ALLEYWAY\n\nBruce arrives at the alley corner, looks off:\n\nANGLE ON BIKER - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe Biker hovers by the side of an apartment building, still grinning\nat Bruce through the rain.  He rolls forward slowly, almost as if\nenticing Bruce to follow him, now disappears again.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce arrives at the rear of the building, which faces on a vacant dirt\nlot.  He edges forward through the mud, turning the corner, suddenly\ncoming face to face with:\n\nThe Biker.  Still grinning.  Switching off his Harley.  Muscles bulging\nthrough his wet T-shirt as he dismounts.\n\nBIKER\nCongratulations, man.\n(wide smile)\nYou caught me.  Matter of fact...\n\nThe ROAR OF ENGINES is HEARD!  Bruce turns to see:  TWO MORE BIKERS,\nrolling into position behind him.  Bruce is hopelessly trapped.\n\nBIKER (CONT'D)\n...you caught all of us...\n\nThe other two Bikers now dismount and close in.  The first Biker draws\nhis gun.  Biker #2 looks Bruce up and down critically, squinting at him\nthrough the rain.\n\nBIKER #2\nThat's my raincoat you're wearing.\nTake it off.\n\nBiker #2 snaps his arm forward - a switchblade appears in his hand.  He\nflicks it at Bruce who stands his ground, slicing a button off the\nfront of his raincoat.\n\nBIKER #2 (CONT'D)\nPick up the button, Wimpy.  Then\nlick it clean and hand me my coat.\n\nBruce stares icily, then slowly bends down to retrieve the button from\nthe mud.  Suddenly:  Biker #1's foot flashes INTO FRAME, headed\nstraight at Bruce's face!  In a lightning-quick move, Bruce grabs the\nswinging leg with both hands, rises, swings Biker #1 off the ground in\na circle, sends him crashing into the motorcycles as his gun goes\nflying.\n\nBiker #2, switchblade in hand, rushes Bruce.  Biker #3 unhooks chains\nfrom his belt.  Bruce sidesteps:  the knife slashes through his\nraincoat, sending it billowing out behind him like a cape!  Biker #3\nwhistles the chains past Bruce's ear:  He snatches them, karate-kicks\nBiker #3 in the stomach, simultaneously belting Biker #2 across the\nside of the head with the chains, knocking him unconscious.\n\nBiker #3 lunges at Bruce from behind!  Bruce spins, grabbing his arm,\ntwisting the knife away, catching it in his other hand as he trips\nBiker #3, sends him sprawling in the mud.  Bruce now straddles him,\nknife in hand.\n\nCLOSE ON BIKER #3\n\nBlinking in fear, his head pressed into the mud next to the button.\n\nBRUCE\nYour turn to pick up the button,\nscumbag...\n\nBiker #3's arm slowly starts forward as Bruce steps on it.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nWith your mouth.\n\nBiker #3 shuts his eyes in humiliation as:  THE SOUND OF A SIREN IS\nHEARD!\n\nANGLE ON SIDE OF BUILDING\n\nTWO POLICEMEN round the corner of the apartment building, now stop,\nstare in astonished silence at:\n\nThe Three Bikers, sprawled in the mud near their machines.  Bruce has\ncompletely disappeared.\n\nEXT. ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT\n\nA paramedic van is parked at the entrance.  Umbrella-holding ONLOOKERS\nwatch.  A gurney with the wounded Man is wheeled out.  The Woman and\nthe Young Girl follow.\n\nBruce appears at the edge of the crowd, collar still up, hat adjusted\nlow over his face  He stares.\n\nThe Paramedics stop.  One leans down, examines the Man, then covers his\nface with the sheet.  The Woman turns away in silence.  The Young Girl\nclings to her.\n\nBruce watches,  his eyes filled with tears.  He turns, walks off as\nCAMERA RACKS FOCUS to the pouring rain.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA RACKS BACK from the rain to Bruce, standing by the Aston-Martin\nin front of Wayne Manor.\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nBruce enters the empty living room.  His expression is numb.  He\npauses, lost in thought.  Then, moving as if by instinct, he heads for\nthe stairs leading to the basement.\n\nINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nBruce descends the stairs, walks down the hallway to a door.  He stops,\nlooks down at the heavy padlock which seals it shut.  His eyes close in\npain, remembering an earlier time.\n\nINT. YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - NIGHT\n\nSeen through dim half-light:  his childhood lab is coated with dust - a\nroom obviously left unused for years.  We hear A KEY TURNING IN THE\nLOCK.  The door to the lab swings open.  Bruce trains a flashlight on\nthe interior of the musty room.  He enters, finds a light switch, flips\nit on.\n\nThe lab table is much as we remember it, crammed with old test tubes,\nbeakers, etc.  Bruce crosses, stares down, lost in his past, then\nswitches on the holograph machine.  He stares - stunned and amazed as:\n\nTHE HOLOGRAPH FIGURE OF TEN-YEAR-OLD BRUCE WAYNE SPRINGS TO LIFE!  An\nexact visual reproduction of the Child who used to be.  The Young Boy\npeers down through a cobwebbed microscope in precisely the position we\nfirst saw him.\n\nBruce's eyes fill with tears - he shuts them tightly as he hears a\nVOICE from long ago.\n\nYOUNG BRUCE'S VOICE\nIt's called a holograph, Dad.\nPretty neat, huh?\n\nOne laser beam suddenly shorts out with age:  the image of Young Bruce\ndisappears.  The second beam continues to burn, its energy directed at\na disintegrating basement wall.\n\nBruce slumps at the other side of the table, oblivious, his face buried\nin his hands.\n\nOVERLAPPING IMAGES AND VOICE START TO APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.\n\nMartha Wayne\t\t\t   - giggling with Young Bruce, then kissing\nher husband passionately.\n\nDR. WAYNE'S VOICE\nThis - is definitely not a guy.\n\nThomas Wayne\t\t\t  - his face twisted in anguish as Chill's\nbullet blows.\n\nMARTHA'S VOICE\nOh, my God!  No!!\n\nA SHARP CRACK!\t    - As a piece of something crumbles away.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nLooking up.  Staring across the room:\n\nThe remaining laser beam has eaten away a piece of the basement wall -\nthere is a dull ECHOING THUD as the plaster hits the bottom of some\nunseen cavernous space below.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nRising.  Crossing curiously to the hole in the wall.  Training his\nflashlight torch through it.\n\nANGLE DOWN HOLE - HIS P.O.V.\n\nAN IMMENSE CAVERN trails down and away into the blackness.  A network\nof aged timbers intersect themselves, shoring up the side of the\nfoundation.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring.  Playing his flashlight against the visible parts of the\nunderground cavity.  He picks up a beaker from the lab table, then lets\nit fall through the hole.  There is an interminable wait.  Finally -\nthe impact of SHATTERING GLASS.\n\nANGLE BACK THROUGH HOLE\n\nSeen from inside:  the torch beam shines.  Suddenly - a long length of\nrope is tossed through.  Bruce appears in the opening.  He wriggles\nthrough, hanging on to the rope.\n\nBruce expertly shimmies down the rope, a man completely at home in an\naction he knows well.  The beam from the torch dances across the walls\nof the cavern:  high-ribbed, jagged walls, suggesting some sort of\nlabyrinth beyond.  The rope has played out.  Bruce hangs by the end,\nlooks down, lets himself fall to the cavern floor below.\n\nHe rises, plays the torch against the sides of the cave.\n\nANGLE ON BEAM - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThe beam searches into crannies, exploring dark gray walls.  It comes\nacross a large patch of solid black.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nLooking curiously.\n\nBACK TO BLACK PATCH\n\nAs the beam hits the black patch fully - dozens of yellow eyes appear.\nThe entire mass LAUNCHES ITSELF INTO CAMERA with a terrifying screech\nand the sound of beating wings.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nHis jaw drops, stunned, as THE COLONY OF BATS swarm over him!  He\nstumbles, protecting his face.  The torch drops to the floor.  Its\nshaft of light dances crazily around the cavern.\n\nFrom O.S. - a low moan is heard from Bruce.  It rises, gathers in\nvolume and intensity, gradually becoming a deep, booming guttural roar\n- at once a scream of total pain and a cry of defiance.  The terrified\nbats scream back in a maze of hot and cold light bouncing off beating\nblack wings.\n\nINT. ALFRED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe wind and rain batter against Alfred's partially open bedroom\nwindow.  Mixed with the sounds - a strong echo of the roar from the\ncavern.  Alfred's eyes pop open.  He rises groggily, makes his way to\nthe window, closes it.  CAMERA HOLDS on window, PANS UP to the moon.\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nEXT. CEMETERY - CLOSE ON MOON - NIGHT\n\nA FLASHING LIGHTNING BOLT:  CAMERA PANS DOWN from the moon through the\nraging storm to the graves of Thomas and Martha Wayne in the country\ncemetery, high on the hill.\n\nKneeling between them is Bruce - fists clenched, head bowed, tiny\nrivulets of water running off his face and body - totally lost in\nsilent prayer.\n\nBRUCE'S VOICE\nI've worked hard to make you proud of\nme.  To become the kind of person\nwhose presence could make a difference\nin the world.  But one man can only do\nonly so much, Father.  Mother, to-\nnight I saw the sign I thought would\nnever come.

GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\nAn express train roars through a seedy subway station.\n\nINT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT\n\nA well-scrubbed TEENAGE COUPLE sit together holding hands.  The BOY is\ndressed in a dinner jacket, the GIRL is a chiffon party dress with a\nprominent orchid corsage pinned to it.  They exchange a nervous glance,\nlooking across the car at:\n\nA TOUGH-LOOKING THUG who sits opposite them, his muscular arms bulging\nthrough a torn windbreaker.  He grins across at the nervous Teenagers\nmenacingly, exposing yellow teeth, then sneaks a sideways look at:  A\nTHICKLY-BUILT TRUCKDRIVER-TYPE who stares straight ahead.\n\nThese are the only four people in the car.\n\nThe subway slows for the next stop.  The Truckdriver-Type rises\ndisinterestedly, crosses the car, looks down at the Teenagers who are\nnone too happy with his departure.\n\nTRUCKDRIVER-TYPE\nHave a nice time at the prom, kids?\n\nBOY\nYes, thank you, Sir.\n\nThe subway doors hiss open.  The Truckdriver-Type smiles and exits.\nThe Teenagers looks across the car worried.\n\nThe car pulls out of the station.  The Thug rises, crosses the car,\ngrabs hold of a vertical pole to steady himself, smirks down at the\nTeenagers.\n\nTHUG\nYou smell good enough to eat, Sweet-\nheart.\n\nBOY\n(nervous bravado)\nIf you've got something to say,\nMister, talk to me, okay?\n\nTHUG\nI was talking to you - Sweetheart.\n\nA knife drops out of the Thug's sleeve into his hand, its razor-sharp\nblade glinting in the light.  The Teenagers freeze with terror.\n\nTHUG (CONT'D)\nMaybe it's that flower that smells\nso good.\n\nThe Thug plucks the corsage off the trembling Girl's bodice, holds it\nup to his nose, inhales deeply, shaking his head.\n\nTHUG (CONT'D)\nNope.  Still can't place it.\n\nVOICE\nFunny.  I can smell you from way\nover here.\n\nThe Thug wheels, stares off at the end of the car, his jaw dropping\nopen.  The Teenagers' eyes bulge in disbelief.\n\nCLOSE ON CHEST\n\nA golden circle with the black figure of a bat sits in the middle of a\nsteel-gray skin-tight fabric stretched across a massively muscled\nchest.\n\nVOICE\nGive the lady back her flower.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Thug looks his unseen adversary up and down cautiously, unsure of\nwhether to laugh or obey.\n\nTHUG\nOkay...sure.  Just wanted to have a\nlittle fun.  I...\n\nWith a sudden lightning move he flips the switchblade in his hand,\nsending it whizzing in the direction of the Voice.\n\nCLOSE ON KNIFE\n\nThe knife whistles through the air TOWARD CAMERA.  Suddenly a black-\ngloved hand miraculously snatches it out of mid-air, spinning it, then\nsends it flying back!\nThe switchblade pierces the corsage, jerking it out of the Thug's hand,\nsticking it into the wall where it quivers behind him.  The Thug\nfreezes, turning white.\n\nVOICE\nNow then.  I think you said you\nwanted to have a little fun.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\nThe express wheezes to a stop at the next station.  A MIDDLE-AGED\nCOUPLE waits for the doors to open, then enter the car.  They suddenly\nstop, staring in amazement:\n\nThe Thug stands spread-eagled in the middle of the car, both wrists\ncuffed to overhanging metal handholds.  The center vertical pole\ndisappears up one pants leg, finally reappearing out of the collar of\nhis shirt.\n\nThe teenage Boy passes the amazed Couple, confidently dusting his\nhands.  He reaches back for the Girl who sniffs her corsage, then\nfollows him out of the car.\n\nEXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nGotham Police Headquarters.  CAMERA TRACKS PAST cubicles and offices,\nCLACKING, RINGING, DETECTIVES interrogating SUSPECTS, etc., catching up\nwith DAVID GORDON, the Commissioner of Police, a gruff-looking man in\nhis middle fifties who pauses to light a cheap cigarette.\n\nHeading toward him from the other direction:  SERGEANT HALEY, a smooth-\nfaced kissass in his thirties.\n\nGORDON\nWhat's up Haley?\n\nHALEY\nPretty slow, Commissioner.

TWO\nPULSATING YELLOW EYES pierce through the blackness.\n\nVOICE\nI just counted you out, Wells.\n\nWells fires!  The Shadow swings the manhole cover up as the bullet\nricochets off it harmlessly.  Wells prepares to fire again.  The\nmanhole cover suddenly explodes out of the darkness!  One swing of a\nmassively muscled arm - one sickening \"clang\" - and it's over.\n\nANGLE ON STREET\n\nSWAT LT.\nLet's go!\n\nThe Police rush toward the alley, Gordon and Haley bringing up the\nrear, as the two Women emerge.\n\nWOMAN\nWOMAN #2\nHe saved us!

Haley cocks his head\nquestioningly at Gordon as they proceed into the alley.\n\nGORDON\nForget it.  That airhead from the\nsubway could never have made it to\nthe north side of town this fast.\n\nHALEY\nMaybe there's more than one of them.\nMaybe we're dealing with some sort\nof secret society of cross-dressers.\n\nWells is led past them, still groggy, as they arrive at the open\nmanhole and peer down into the forbidding blackness.\n\nGORDON\nGet after him, Haley.\n\nHALEY\n(gulping)\nMe, Sir?\n\nGORDON\nWell, you're the only one with an\naccurate description!\n\nHaley reluctantly lowers himself into the open manhole as Gordon turns,\nyells down the alleyway.\n\nGORDON (CONT'D)\nComb the area!

GOTHAM APARTMENT HOUSE - HIGH SHOT - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA LOOKS DOWN from the roof of a Gotham skyscraper at the windows\nof a forty-story apartment house below.\n\nCAMERA HOLDS on a pair of glass doors leading out to a rosetta-carved\nstone balcony.  Clearly visible through the doors:  AN ELDERLY COUPLE\nlie face down on the floor of their living room, guarded by a masked\nBURGLAR holding a shotgun.  ANOTHER BURGLAR has managed to open a wall\nsafe and begins stuffing valuables into a gunny sack.\n\nCAMERA ZOOMS BACK!\n\nWe are some thirty stories higher across a wide avenue.\n\nA black-gloved hand ENTERS FRAME, holding a thin, clear nylon cord with\na tiny barbed fishhook on the end.\n\nThe other gloved hand steadies a gleaming titanium rifle barrel with an\ninfrared scope.  The fishhook is threaded through the chamber.\n\nA flap is opened in a thick, compartmentalized black belt.  The\nmoonlight glints off a cylindrical silver gas cartridge.\n\nANGLE ACROSS STREET THROUGH SCOPE\n\nSeen through the magnified infrared scope:  the cross hairs of the\nrifle sight settle in on the head of the Burglar holding the shotgun.\n\nThe cross hairs pause - then suddenly lower to the balcony.  The rifle\nFIRES with an audible \"hiss\" of compressed gas.\n\nANGLE ON ROSETTA BALCONY\n\nAs the fishhook whistles through a hole in the rosetta stone framework\nof the balcony.

SKYSCRAPER ROOF - NIGHT\n\nThe nylon cord has been pulled taut - it disappears down into the\nblackness at a dizzying height, some four hundred feet above the avenue\nand crisscrossing traffic lights below.\n\nBlack-gloved hands take hold of the cord, testing it.\n\nEXT.

YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - DAY\n\nYoung Bruce Wayne's lab room remains much as we remember it, except\nthat the gaping hole in the wall caused by the laser has been\nreinforced and shaped into a doorway.  A make-shift ladder-like\nstairway leads down into the cavern below.\n\nFOOTSTEPS are heard climbing the ladder from deep within the cave.\nAfter a moment, Bruce appears, stripped to the waist, still wearing his\nutility belt and the bottom half of his Batman suit.  His chest and\nstomach are nicked with small cuts and bruises from his previous\nnight's work.  His forehead glistens with sweat born of utter\nexhaustion.  He sits heavily on a cot, buries his face in his hands,\nlooks up suddenly as the door to the lab opens.\n\nAlfred enters, stares silently, first appalled by Bruce's physical\ncondition, then shaking his head with sympathy.  Bruce stares back,\neyes heavy with lack of sleep.\n\nBRUCE\nYou...think I'm crazy, don't you?\nCertifiably insane.\n\nALFRED\n(pause; smile)\nA bit...eccentric, perhaps.\n\nBRUCE\nIt's...what I have to do, Alfred.\nAfter all those years of searching\n-- it was always what I had to do.\n\nALFRED\nIf I may be permitted, Sir...\n(with difficulty)\nI've...never had any children of my\nown.  Never saw the advantage in it,\nconsidering my profession.

GOTHAM COUNTRY CLUB - DAY\n\nBruce lies on a deck chair by the swimming pool of the Gotham Country\nClub, his body coated with sun oil.  He listens to Gordon's TV press\nconference on a tiny transistor set next to him.  His eyes flutter open\nwith amusement.\n\nTV REPORTER\nWell considering the fact he apprehended\nfour criminals last night, shouldn't we\nbe calling him...a good Samaritan?\n\nGORDON\nSure.  If you feel like calling John\nHinkley a political activist.\n\nBruce's eyes suddenly bulge wider.  He gazes across the swimming pool,\ntransfixed by what he sees.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER - BRUCE'S P.O.V.\n\nA stunning-looking woman (SILVER ST. CLOUD) steps out onto the high\nboard of the pool, dressed in a daringly-cut shiny white latex tank\nsuit.  A shining mane of glistening silver hair cascades down across\nher shoulders.  She pauses, a shimmering white diamond in the sun.\n\nREPORTER'S VOICE\nCommissioner, it might surprise you\nto know that several polls taken\ntoday show more than eighty percent\nof those interviewed approve of\nthis...vigilante and what he did...\n\nSilver glances over in Bruce's direction.  Curiously enough, she seems\nto smile at him and wave.\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nWell I can't account for public\ntaste, bit I'd like to warn any\npotential copy cats who may be out\nthere that...\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce is stunned and confused, but starts to lift his hand to wave back\nwhen:\n\nTHORNE'S VOICE\nIf brains were bodies, she'd look\njust the same.  Can you believe it?\n\nBruce swivels, lowering his hand.  Thorne stands behind him, waves back\nat Silver who executes a complicated but perfect dive into the pool.\nShe starts to swim across in their direction as Throne grins down at\nBruce.\n\nTHORNE\nName's Silver St. Cloud.  Phi Beta\nKappa, Masters Degree in Political\nScience.  Just arrived in Gotham to\nfinish her doctorate on municipal\ngovernment and guess which City\ncouncilman drew her as an intern?\n\nBRUCE\n(staring)\nTaught her much so far?\n\nTHORNE\n(chuckle)\nNot as much as I plan to.\n\nSilver reaches the edge of the pool.  Thorne starts to help her out as\nBruce continues to start.\n\nSILVER\nThe water's glorious, Rupert.  Come\non in.\n\nTHORNE\nNever had time to learn how to swim.\nToo busy trying to make a living, I\nguess.  Not like Mr. Wayne over\nhere...\n(chuckle)\nRight, Bruce?\n(turns)\nSilver St. Cloud - Bruce Wayne.\n\nBruce looks up, totally mesmerized by the sight of her.  She gazes down\nwith a devastating smile, the sun sparkling off the beads of water on\nher face.  She is instantly and equally smitten as they lock eyes.\n\nSILVER\nPlease don't get up.\n\nBRUCE\n(lost)\nHmm?\n\nSILVER\nI said - please don't get up.\n\nBRUCE\nOh.\n(starts to get up)\nSorry...\n\nSILVER\nThat's all right.  I asked you not\nto, remember?\n\nBRUCE\n(stops)\nSo you did.  Thanks.\n\nSILVER\nDon't mention it.\n\nRupert watches them watching each other.  The uncomfortable silence is\nfilled by Gordon's VOICE from the television.\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nAnd now, if there are no other ques-\ntions, it's my birthday tonight and\nI have a formal party to get ready\nfor...\n\nThorne reaches down, turns off the TV in disgust.\n\nTHORNE\nThat clown has been a disgrace to\nlaw enforcement his entire career.\nThis city's going to hell in a hand-\nbasket and some imbecile's giving\nhim a formal birthday party.\n\nBRUCE\nIt should be fun.  I'm giving it.\n\nThorne raises his eyebrows.  Silver still stares.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nPerhaps the two of you would like to\ncome?\n\nTHORNE\nSILVER\nI'm busy, thanks.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   I'd\nlove to.\n\nTHORNE\n(irritated)\nSilver, I don't think...ah...\n\nSILVER\nIf I'm not being too inquisitive,\nMr. Wayne - exactly what is it you\ndo?\n\nBRUCE\nDo?\n\nSILVER\nFor a living?\n\nTHORNE\n(chuckles)\nYou're looking at it.\n\nBRUCE\nActually, Rupert's not being\nentirely fair about his...\n(nice smile)\nSometimes I go hang gliding.\n\nSILVER\nAnd that's it?\n\nBRUCE\nNot quite.\n\nSILVER\nI didn't think so.\n\nBRUCE\nI have a dog as well.\n\nSilver manages a tiny, unsure smile.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nWayne Manor.  Eight o'clock.  I'll\nhave my car pick you up.\n\nTHORNE\nWhy don't you take my car, Silver?\nIn case you want to leave early.\n\nSILVER\nI'm very flattered by the dueling\nlimos, gentlemen, but I can grab a\ncab, thanks.\n(nods)\nMr. Wayne...\n\nSilver excuses herself.  Both men watch her departure avidly.\n\nTHORNE\nGotham City's no place for a beauti-\nful woman to be travelling alone.\nI'm holding you personally responsi-\nble for her safety, Wayne.\n\nBRUCE\nDon't worry, Rupert.  I'll treat her\njust as if I were in love with her\ninstead of you.\n\nThorne's eyes narrow.  Bruce smiles ingenuously.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nDozens of expensive cars disgorge their passengers in front of stately\nWayne Manor.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nA lavish party is in progress.

The Guest howls with laughter, moves\noff as Gordon orders another drink and Bruce joins him with a\nsympathetic smile.\n\nBRUCE\nThey're giving you a pretty hard time\nabout that Batman, aren't they...\n\nGordon nods, tosses back his drink angrily.\n\nGORDON\nI'd give up half my pension to be\nstanding face to face with that\ncaped fruitcake right now.\n(looks off; stares)\nNow there's a sight to make an old\nman's eyes water.\n\nSilver St. Cloud approaches them, threading her way through the\nappreciative glances of the Guests, dressed in a sparkling, metallic\nevening gown, the light bouncing off it like tiny bursts of shooting\nstars.  She reaches Bruce, extends her hand with a warm smile.\n\nSILVER\nI hope I'm not too late.\n\nGORDON\nIn my case, by twenty years.\n\nBRUCE\nSilver, St. Cloud - this is David\nGordon, Commissioner of Police.\nMiss St. Cloud is picking up the\nfiner points of the city government from\nCouncilman Thorne.\n\nSILVER\nMy ambition is to hold a job as\nimportant as yours one day, Commis-\nsioner.\n\nGORDON\nThen you and Mr. Thorne already have\nmuch in common.\n\nSILVER\n(suddenly)\nWould you care to dance, Mr. Wayne?\n\nBRUCE\n(locking eyes)\nYou're as clairvoyant as you are\nbeautiful, Miss St. Cloud.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nNow heading into the driveway is a brightly painted version of an old-\ntime twenties paddy wagon, with two look-alikes of the old KEYSTONE\nKOPS riding on top.

A LOUD FANFARE is played.  All conversation stops as the\nfront door opens.\n\nNow entering Wayne Manor:  the Two Keystone Kops, in their twenties'\ncostumes with handlebar moustaches.  They dance their way to the center\nof the room in a prearranged routine, singing in harmony from Pirates\nof Penzance.\n\nKOPS\nWhen a felon's not engaged in his\nemployment,\nOr maturing his felonious little\nplans,\nHis capacity for innocent enjoyment\nIs just as great as any honest\nman's...\nOh, a policeman's lot is not a happy\none...\n\nThe Guests applaud loudly.

Have you seen a\npoliceman around here?\n\nKOP #2\nWhy no, I haven't.\n\nKOP\n(drawing gun)\nGood.  Then give me your watch.\n\nSeveral Guests laugh.  Bruce winces at the bad joke.\n\nKOP #2\nBut this watch isn't worth anything.\nIt only has a sentimental value.\n\nKOP\nWell give it to me anyway.  I feel\nlike a good cry.\n\nGordon laughs loudly as the Kop turns to him.\n\nKOP (CONT'D)\nNow, Commissioner, if we could\nborrow your watch for a moment...\n\nGORDON\n(taking it off)\nSure.  Be careful with it, okay?\n\nThe Kop smiles, takes the watch, dangles it from his hand.  Kop #2\nsilently sidles in behind Bruce and Silver.\n\nKOP\nHere's a good one:  what's a police-\nman's favorite way to kill time?\n\nGORDON\n(grinning)\nI'll bite.  What is a policeman's\nfavorite way to kill time?\n\nThe Kop grins, pull his gun - FIRES!  Gordon's watch is smashed to\nsmithereens.  Kop #2's gun suddenly at the back of Silver's head,\nhammer cocked.\n\nKOP #2\nUp against the wall, everybody!\nMove!!\n\nThe Guests scream as six more Kops burst through the front door\ncarrying automatic weapons.  Bruce, Silver, and Gordon are herded back\nagainst the wall with the others.\n\nThe KOP grins, then suddenly starts to giggle insanely.  He takes off\nhis helmet, as a shock of GREEN HAIR is exposed!  He wipes his lips\nclean which now become ruby red.  Cackling in glee, THE JOKER faces his\nvictims, his gaze suddenly becoming cruel and cold.\n\nJOKER\nOne at a time, your money and your\njewels, and no one's head'll wind\nup looking like the Commissioner's\nwatch, capisce?\n\nKOP #3\nHey, boss!  Look!\n\nThe Joker turns.  Kop #3 and a PARTNER have set Gordon's huge birthday\ncake on the floor, now wade through it, stomping up and down, kicking\nthe insides across the room.\n\nKOP #3\nWe're doing the cake walk!\n\nThe Joker giggles, then shoots a satanically maniacal look at the\nGuests who instantly begin stripping off their jewelry, taking out\nwallets, etc. as more Kops pass by with a gunny sack.  The Joker walks\ndown the line, stopping to level a searching and curious gaze into the\neyes of:\n\nBruce Wayne, between Gordon and Silver, his face set, eyes steely,\nstaring at the Joker.  His jaw twitches.\n\nSilver watches him, noticing the twitch.  She gives him a tiny,\nsympathetic smile, then turns to face:\n\nKop #2, who has moved down the line to Silver.  He looks her up and\ndown hungrily as she stares back in defiance.  His fingers slowly reach\nup to grip her necklace, then linger.\n\nKOP #2\nIn your case, lady, I'd like to\nrip the rest off and leave this on.\n\nSuddenly:  BRUCE'S FIST FLASHES INTO FRAME!  Kop #2 is knocked backward\nthrough the air as another Kop lunges at Bruce who grabs the gunny sack\nfilled with jewelry and bashes him in the face!  The Kop crumples to\nthe floor as Bruce wheels to face the Joker and sees:\n\nThe Joker, grinning cruelly, the barrel of his gun pressing up under\nSilver's chin.  Her eyes are welded shut with fear.\n\nJOKER\nNow that was extremely bad manners,\nMr. Wayne.  Especially from someone...\n(gestures)\n...to the Manor born...\n(giggles)\nSo why don't you rejoin the lady here,\nor if you like...\n(cocks gun; glowers)\nI can send part of her over to you.\n\nBruce hesitates, then rejoins the line.  The Joker lowers his gun,\nturns to stare at a painting on the wall as a Kop holds out the open\ngunny sack to Gordon.\n\nGORDON\n(to Joker)\nI'll see you rot in the gas chamber\nfor this.\n\nThe Joker smiles, ignoring him, looking at the portrait painting which\nis of a distinguished older man.  He removes it from the wall.  An\nindignant Alfred speaks up from farther down the line of Guests.\n\nALFRED\nBe careful, you clot!  That portrait\ngoes back to Mr. Wayne's grandfather!\n\nJOKER\nWhy?  Is there something wrong with\nit?\n\nThe Joker cackles, punching the painting out of its frame.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nBruce stares silently.  His jaw twitches with anger born of\nhumiliation.  Silver notices again.\n\nSILVER\n(whisper)\nLook on the bright side.  You're\nadorable when your jaw twitches.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Joker crosses to Gordon with the empty picture frame.  Another Kop\npoints a camera as the Joker holds the frame up to encircle his and\nGordon's face.\n\nJOKER\n(giggling)\nI've always wanted to frame a Police\nCommissioner...\n\nCLOSE ON JOKER'S AND GORDON'S FACES\n\nGordon shuts his eyes in disgrace.  The Joker howls with glee.\n\nTHE FLASHBULB STROBE WIPES THE SCEEN!\n\nEXT.

Good-night.  I guess...\n\nSILVER\n(sudden grin)\nWhy don't be silly.

POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nGordon walks slowly and dejectedly down the nearly deserted hallway.\nAs he passes one DETECTIVE'S cubicle, the sound of SNICKERING is HEARD\nfrom inside.\n\nGordon stops defiantly.  The snickering instantly dies away.  Muttering\ndisgustedly, Gordon enters his office.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThe office is lit only be a small desk lamp.  Strung up behind the desk\nis a crudely-made banner reading:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO OUT COMMISH - FROM\nALL YOUR BOYS IN BLUE.\n\nGordon shakes his head sadly, crosses to a cabinet, pours himself an\nenormous glass of Scotch, then crosses with the bottle to the open\noffice window.

Bruce shuts off his torch, removes a faceplate, reaches back for\na long cylindrical network of crisscrossing cables.

Alfred\nhurries through the opening in the wall.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SKY - NIGHT\n\nKnifing up into the blackness over the skyline of Gotham City - THE\nGLEAMING BATSIGNAL!\n\nINT. THORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThe office has been ransacked.  Drawers overturned, bookcases emptied,\nwith piles of paper and debris strewn across the floor.\n\nSilver sits in a chair, conscious but still groggy.  Thorne paces\nangrily in front of Gordon, kicking trash left and right as the Batman\nwatches from inside the doorway, his eyes darting back and forth.\n\nTHORNE\nIt's unbelievable!  The Joker!\nRight here in my office!\n(at Silver)\nHe could have killed her!\n(realizes)\nHe could have killed me, for God's\nsake!\n\nBATMAN\nI wonder why he didn't...\n\nBatman crosses, eyes riveted on Silver.  She feels his magnetic gaze on\nher, now stares back, fascinated by him.\n\nTHORNE\nYou sound disappointed!\n\nGORDON\nCalm down, Rupert!  We've got a long\nnight ahead of us.\n\nTHORNE\nWhat's this we crap?\n\nGORDON\nWell, you're the only one who'd know\nwhat was missing.\n(turns)\nI'll send for a squad car to drive\nyou home, Miss St. Cloud.\n\nSilver nods at Gordon, then looks back into the dark, magnetically\nintimidating gaze of the Batman.\n\nSILVER\nPerhaps...the Batman would be kind\nenough to see me home.\n\nTHORNE\nWhat?\n\nBatman stares back at Silver with no apparent reaction.  She smiles\nunsteadily, not sure of herself.\n\nSILVER\nIf I'm not too far out of your way.\n\nBATMAN\n(pause)\nI can't imagine such a place exists,\nMiss St. Cloud.\n\nTHORNE\nOh, brother...\n\nSilver blushes, then rises, offers Batman her arm.\n\nSILVER\nGood-night, Rupert...\n\nTHORNE\nWait!...\n\nBatman leads Silver out the door.  Thorne's face trembles with rage and\nfrustration as Gordon looks over curiously.\n\nGORDON\nRelax, Rupert.  Who could she be\nsafer with?\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN on Thorne's troubled face.\n\nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nBatman leads Silver to the elevator, presses the button.\n\nSILVER\nWe're taking the elevator?\n\nBATMAN\nDoesn't everybody?\n\nSILVER\nWhy did I have this feeling we'd be\ndropping out a window together, or\nsomething exotic like that...\n\nThe elevator arrives.

Silver screams as she\nand Batman are momentarily pushed up into the air.  Batman grabs onto a\nlight fixture in the roof, bashes the ceiling escape hatch away.\n\nANGLE ON ELEVATOR\n\nPlummeting down the shaft.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nHe reaches into his utility belt, pulls out a nail-like piece of curved\nmetal attached to a nylon cord.  It pops open into a large, four-\npronged fish hook.\n\nBATMAN\nGrab my belt!  Hang on!\n\nANGLE IN SHAFT\n\nThe hook flies out of the top of the sinking elevator heading for the\nwall of the shaft.  It grazes down the shaft wall, catches on one set\nof gears which allow the doors to open on each individual floor.  The\nnylon cord goes taut.\n\nBACK TO ELEVATOR\n\nSilver hangs on as Batman hooks his arm around her.  The two of them\nshoot upwards through the escape hatch.\n\nANGLE ON ELEVATOR\n\nStill plummeting.  It hits the ground with an ear-splitting, sickening\ncrash.\n\nINT.

It opens.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman and Silver hang by the cord in the shaft, her arms locked around\nhim in a death grip.  She stares, goggle-eyed.\n\nBATMAN\n(at Silver)\nNext time - remind me to try the\nwindow.\n\nEXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\nBatman and Silver walk down a deserted street.  She is a wreck -\ntrembling, ripped dress, with streaks of cable grease on her face and\nhair.\n\nBATMAN\nI'm parked in the alleyway.

Batman and\nSilver's heads snap up:\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN'S GANG - THEIR P.O.V.\n\nTHREE PENGUIN CONFEDERATES whizz down at them through the night sky\nwearing jetpacks!  Orange flames shoot out from behind their propelling\nrigs as they maneuver through the air, now heading into a synchronized\npower dive.\n\nThe Penguin hovers above, still supported by his whirling umbrella-\ncopter.\n\nA hail of MACHINE GUN BULLETS spews forth from guns mounted on top of\ntheir packs - the flyers close in on Batman and Silver like attacking\nfighter planes.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN AND SILVER\n\nBatman dives behind a row of garbage cans, pushing a screaming Silver\ndown in front of him as the fusillade ricochets off the cans and\nbuilding walls.\n\nThe flying formation zooms back up into the sky again, preparing to\nmake another pass.  Batman turns to a trembling Silver who is paralyzed\nwith fear.\n\nBATMAN\nStay here!  It's me they want...\n\nSILVER\nDon't leave me!!\n\nBatman turns and looks:  she is a quaking mess.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nOh, please?

A sleek,\npowerful, futuristic panther of a car - jet black with a domed\ninterior.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nThe interior is a glistening, intricate maze of computers, screens, and\ncomplicated electrical systems.  Silver's eyes are frozen open in\nastonishment.

There is one.\n\nANGLE ON SKY\n\nThe Penguin and his three Jetpack Bandits zoom down at the car, their\nmounted machine guns BLAZING.  Bandit #1 powers forward, spewing\nbullets as he comes.\n\nINT.

They soar higher to avoid their own fire.\n\nBACK ON BATMOBILE\n\nSpeeding down an avenue along the side of the park.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nSilver looks over hopefully.\n\nSILVER\nI guess we frightened them off.\n\nBatman shakes his head, flips another switch:  A small radar screen\nlights up.  Three blinking LIGHT BLIPS are still following them.\nBatman suddenly looks ahead, eyes widening.\n\nANOTHER CAR heads directly at them, guns blazing!\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nI think I'll keep my mouth shut.\n\nANGLE ON STREET\n\nThe HOOD CAR swerves off the street into the park.  The Batmobile\nsqueals into a 180 and roars after it.\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN IN SKY\n\nThe Penguin watches from the sky with satisfaction.\n\nPENGUIN\nHe's taken the bait...\n\nHe motions two Bandits to fly off in another direction, then:  swivels\nin mid-air, points Bandit #3 down at the Batmobile.\n\nPENGUIN (CONT'D)\nThe tires, you Cretin!  Go for the tires!\n\nANGLE ON PARK ROAD\n\nThe Batmobile pursues the Hood Car through the park as Bandit #3 looms\nup from behind, guns blazing.\n\nINT.

BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nBATMAN\nDo you know what the number one hazard\nis on the American road these days?\n\nSILVER\n(weak smile)\nSurprise me...\n\nBATMAN\nTailgaters.\n\nANGLE ON REAR OF BATMOBILE\n\nThe trunk of the Batmobile suddenly pops open!  A giant horseshoe\nmagnet swivels, pointing out behind the car!\n\nANGLE ON BANDIT #3\n\nScreaming, wide-eyed, as the force of the powerful magnet spins him in\nmid-air and he is sucked into the trunk by his jetpack.  The trunk\ncloses on him, slamming shut.\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN IN SKY\n\nThe Penguin looks down disgustedly, then lifts his gaze ahead and\nbelow, into the park.\n\nEXT. PARK - ANGLE ON CURVE - NIGHT\n\nA Bandit watches near a curve in the park road as the Hood Car roars\nby.

BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nBatman looks ahead, suddenly worried.\n\nANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD\n\nTwo blazing headlights seem to be speeding directly at him, growing\nlarger by the second!\n\nBACK TO BATMOBILE\n\nSILVER\nHit the brakes!  Hit the brakes!\n\nBatman grimly steps on the accelerator!\n\nANGLE ON FRONT BUMPER\n\nNow emerging from the front of the Batmobile:  a long, black battering\nram with a RAZOR SHARP GLEAMING STEEL TIP!\n\nBACK TO VIEW THROUGH WINDSHIELD\n\nThe two oncoming headlights are about to make contact as:\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe Batmobile EXPLODES though what was a GIANT MIRROR in a sea of\nflying glass!\n\nBandit #2 lets off an ineffectual burst of automatic fire, now lowers\nhis weapon in disgust as the vehicle roars on.\n\nBACK TO PENGUIN IN SKY\n\nGritting his teeth in frustration, looking up ahead.\n\nEXT. PARK - ANGLE OF BRIDGE OVER LAKE - NIGHT\n\nThe Park road curves onto a bridge which spans the park lake.  The Hood\nCar speeds quickly across it.\n\nANGLE BELOW BRIDGE\n\nA Bandit stands by a plunger-detonator device.\n\nBACK TO BRIDGE\n\nThe Batmobile starts across at full speed.  Suddenly - A HUGE EXPLOSION\ncollapses the section of the bridge directly in front of it!\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nPlummeting down through the air toward the lake.  Batman works his\ncontrols frantically as Silver screams!\n\nANGLE ON LAKE\n\nThe Batmobile plunges into the lake!  A brilliant SHOWER OF BLUE SPARKS\nexplode across the water's surface as the vehicle disappears.  For a\nmoment, all is still.\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN IN AIR\n\nThe Penguin looks down, \"clucking\" contentedly.  His expression\nsuddenly starts to change.\n\nANGLE ON LAKE - HIS P.O.V.\n\nSlowly re-emerging on the surface of the lake:  The Batmobile!  Its\nroaring turbine engines propel it forward, now supported by TWO\nHYDROFOIL PONTOONS!  The makeshift craft speeds over the water at\nspeedboat velocity.\n\nThe Batmobile reaches shore, churning up chunks of mud as the pontoons\ncontract and the car bounces onto the park road.  The protective blue\nlight has been extinguished.  From either side:  two Hood Cars\napproach, machine guns blazing!\n\nBatman swerves the Batmobile onto the grass, roars cross-country toward\na park exit as the hail of bullets begins to make CRACKS across its\nprotective dome.\n\nANGLE ON PARK EXIT AND STREET\n\nThe Batmobile speeds out into the street.  One Hood Car is in hot\npursuit - the other exits the park a block ahead and roars at the\nBatmobile from the other direction!\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nSilver looks over at Batman, trembling, as more bullets \"chunk\" into\nthe car dome, weakening it further.\n\nSILVER\nListen...it was nice of you to offer\nto take me home, but maybe I'd\nbetter grab a cab...\n\nEXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\nThe Batmobile is about to become a sandwich as Batman suddenly squeals\nthe vehicle into a parking building!  The Hood Cars do respective 180's\nand follow suit.\n\nINT. PARKING BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nThe Batmobile roars around hairpin turns, ascending the levels of the\nparking building like a sportscar.\n\nThe Hood Cars screech after him, gaining speed.  They pursue Batman\nhigher and higher, threading the narrow openings through the lines of\nparked cars, tearing off side mirrors, doors, and fenders on their way\nby.\n\nANGLE ON HIGHER LEVEL\n\nThe Batmobile, reaching the level just under the roof, squeals around a\ncorner, catches the fender of a parked car, and spins out of control!\n\nBatman slams on the brakes as the Batmobile skids and turns to face:\n\nThe two Hood Cars, which have stopped so that they are completely\nblocking off the exit ramps, up and down.  The OCCUPANTS stare in\namazement as the Batmobile suddenly roars at them!\n\nINT.

Jet-\npropelled afterburners ignite!\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe Batmobile has reached the edge of the roof, now LAUNCHES ITSELF\ninto space in an upwards arc!\n\nThe two Hood Cars are unable to cope with the sudden void between them\nand crash head-on with a sickening crunch!\n\nANGLE ON PENGUIN IN MID-AIR\n\nStaring in total shock - frozen in mid-air as the Batmobile arcs up\ntoward him.\n\nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT\n\nThe figure of the Penguin grows rapidly larger through the windshield.\nBATMAN HONKS AT HIM!\n\nBACK TO MID-AIR\n\nThe Penguin takes a panicked, last-second evasive action, diving low as\nthe Batmobile streaks by:\n\nThe white-hot turbine flames from the vehicle's exhaust crease the top\nof his umbrella-copter's whirling ribs, MELTING THEM INTO DISFIGURED\nCURLEQUES!\n\nThe Penguin looks up in despair as his umbrella-copter begins to spin\nout of control.  He gives a birdlike SCREECH, then zig-zags helplessly\nthrough the air!\n\nBACK TO BATMOBILE\n\nThe sleek vehicle completes its downward arc through the air and lands\non the roof of the building across the street.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM SKY\n\nThe Penguin cartwheels end over end through the air, his umbrella-\ncopter sputtering.\n\nINT. RICH APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nDozens of GUESTS surround a lavishly decorated banquet table in an\nexpensive apartment.  A Bar Mitzvah celebration is in progress.

SILVER'S HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nBatman and Silver stop at her apartment door.  She smiles at him\nthrough smeared elevator cable grease.\n\nBATMAN\nI'm...very sorry for tonight.  You\nmust have been terrified.\n\nSILVER\nWell, I've thought of a way you can\nmake it up to me.\n\nBatman looks at her curiously.  She suddenly kisses him, deeply.  He\nallows it, unwilling or unable to pull away.\n\nCLOSE-UP\n\nSilver's eyes open.  She knows - or thinks she does.\n\nThey break.  Silver smiles mysteriously, whistles under her breath,\nenters her apartment.\n\nINT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nShe leans against the door, sighs.  Could it be true?\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nOn the other side of the door, worried.  Does she know?\n\nINT. TV STUDIO - DAY\n\nThe quiz show The Joker Is Wild broadcasts before a live audience.

The audience stares back.  His eyes narrow.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nBut I digress.  You see, I'm in the\nprocess of developing a new series...\n(evil smile)\n...of killings.

I can't chance it.\n\nBruce turns away in disgust, his mind racing.\n\nALFRED\n(sympathetic)\nWell...perhaps a night on the town\nas Bruce Wayne might be therapeutic\nfor you after all.  You do have\ntickets for the gala opening of the\nopera.  I was planning on using one\nmyself, but if you'd prefer a more\nlively and decorative companion I\nquite understand.\n\nBRUCE\nYou know what?

GOTHAM OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nDozens of shiny limousines disgorge Gotham's formally dressed ELITE in\nfront of the opera house.  Photographer's flashbulbs indicate that it\nis indeed a gala opening.

Archerd blinks in disbelief as the Crowd\nparts and Batman enters the lobby.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nFrozen.  He exchanges an incredulous glance with Alfred.\n\nCLOSE ON SILVER\n\nTotally taken aback.

Archerd swallows\nnervously.\n\nARCHERD\nYou're...taking quite a chance,\nshowing up in public like this,\naren't you, Batman?\n\nBATMAN\nThe way I see it, we're all taking\nquite a chance if we let a sick\ncriminal mind like the Joker paralyze\nthis entire community with fear.\n\nAn angry MUTTERING is heard from within the Crowd.\n\nCROWD MEMBER\nSure.

More angry muttering is\nheard, now mixed in with boos.\n\nCROWD #2\nCROWD #3\n\t\t\t\t\t Get him out of here!\nGo home, Batman!\n\nThe boos grow louder and defiant, as Gordon hurries to the fake\nBatman's side and Thorne smiles thinly at the imposter.\n\nTHORNE\nIt seems you're not exactly the\npeople's choice anymore, Batman...\n\nGORDON\n(at Batman)\nC'mon.  Let me get you out of here\nbefore these gentle people tear you\nup into little pieces...\n\nGordon leads a reluctant Batman away through the jeering Crowd.

A stern-faced Thorne plays to his audience for all\nhe's worth.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nWhat the Batman just did was inex-\ncusable.  Perhaps even criminal.\nBut he's right about one thing.  No\ncheap hoodlum is going to intimidate\nRupert Thorne while I still have the\nsaliva to spit on him!  My ticket\nsays seat E-6, and that's where I'm\nparking my keyster for the next\nfew hours!\n(pause; low voice)\nAnd I call upon His Honor, the\nMayor, to join me in the audience.\n\nThe Crowd looks over to the side of the lobby:\n\nGOTHAM'S MAYOR emerges from a group of onlookers.  A grey-haired man\nwho is visibly terrified, he swallows hard.\n\nMAYOR\nCouncilman Thorne is right, of\ncourse.  And I expect every other\ndecent citizen of Gotham City to\nstand up and be counted.\n\nThe Mayor silently starts up the stairs to the mezzanine.  After a\nbeat, Thorne theatrically extends his arm to Silver who hesitates, then\nreluctantly joins him.  They start for the orchestra section as others\nin the Crowd begin to follow.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nWatching Silver disappear.  His jaw twitches.\n\nINT. OPERA MEZZANINE - NIGHT\n\nBruce and Alfred head for their box.  The Mayor approaches from the\nother direction, now escorted by Gordon and a phalanx of Police.  The\nMayor sees Bruce and stops to shake hands.\n\nMAYOR\nIt's good of you to stay, Bruce...\n\nBRUCE\nYou've made a courageous decision,\nYour Honor.  I hope it's the right\none.\n\nThe Mayor nods grimly, enters his box.  The Police form a guard by the\ndoor.\n\nINT. BRUCE'S BOX - NIGHT\n\nAs Bruce and Alfred enter.  Gordon stands in their box, a radio\nreceiver in his ear.  A loud ovation is heard.\n\nWIDE SHOT - AUDIENCE\n\nThe audience is on its feet, facing away from the stage, applauding the\nMayor in his box.  The Mayor lifts his arms in a victory salute.  The\napplause dies down.  The lights dim.  The Overture to I Pagliacci is\nheard, O.S.   CAMERA RISES past the Mayor and his party to the hanging\nchandelier directly above him.  The fixture consists of huge crystal\nteardrops.\n\nEXTREME CLOSE ON CHANDELIER\n\nOne of the crystals is filled with a clear liquid.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBruce and Alfred settle into their chairs.

OPERA HOUSE - ANGLE ON STAGE\n\nThe Leading Man (CANIO), dressed as a clown, sings the aria \"Vesti La\nGiubba\".  A passionate, sad piece.  He kneels in front of a large\ngaily-painted drum.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nAlfred nods off in his chair.  Bruce elbows him gently.\n\nBACK TO CANIO\n\nApproaching the high point of the aria.  With a magnificent voice, he\nreaches for a \"High C\", hits it strongly and purely, holds on to the\nnote.\n\nANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX\n\nThe Mayor and his party exchange impressed glances.  CAMERA PUSHES IN\nON the chandelier teardrop.  It trembles from the force of the High C -\nnow cracks.  The liquid drips down into the box.\n\nBACK TO STAGE\n\nThe sad aria is ending.  Canio is on his knees, sobbing.  He sings\npianissimo, milking every heart-breaking second.  Suddenly - O.S. - a\nchuckle.  Then the sound of laughter.  Canio peers angrily into the\naudience.\n\nANGLE ON AUDIENCE\n\nConfused, then irritated, as the laughter grows louder.\n\nANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX\n\nThe Mayor and his Party guffaw loudly, pounding their chairs in glee.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE\n\nBruce rises from his seat, concerned.\n\nBACK TO MAYOR\n\nTears of laughter stream down the Mayor's cheeks.  He is on his feet\nnow, totally out of control.  The others flop over their chairs,\nroaring helplessly.\n\nBACK TO CANIO\n\nHe walks off the stage in disgust.\n\nBACK TO MAYOR'S BOX\n\nWith a sudden, final burst of insane giggling - all four men collapse.\nThe Mayor hangs over the edge of his box, dead - a grotesque grin\nfrozen on his face.\n\nANGLE ON AUDIENCE\n\nGasping.  Panicking.  As:\n\nANGLE ON STAGE\n\nThe huge clown drum suddenly rips apart from the center.  The Joker\nsteps out, dressed as an obese soprano.\n\nJOKER\nWait!  The opera's not over till the\nfat lady sings!\n\nThe Joker hits his own version of a High C as:\n\nGORDON'S VOICE\nOpen fire!\n\nThe lights go out.

Thinking.  He passes the huge crime computer, pauses,\nlooks down, punches some keys.\n\nANGLE ON COMPUTER SCREEN\n\nA series of CRIMINAL MUG SHOTS flashes across the screen, law-breakers\nof every variety, finally stopping at:\n\nThe face of the Joker - grinning down menacingly.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring back.  Face set.  Jaw twitching.\n\nThe screen suddenly goes blank.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nAlfred has turned off the computer.  Bruce stares numbly.\n\nALFRED\nSir, I...\n(swallows)\nPerhaps...this isn't the only way.\nPerhaps this is all meant to signal\na...a new beginning for you.  After\nall, you're an intelligent, enter-\nprising young man with every capa-\nbility in the world to...\n\nBruce puts his hand on Alfred's shoulder.\n\nBRUCE\nI...know you love me very much, and I'm\ndeeply grateful, but I wish you'd get\nout of here now, and leave me alone.\n\nAlfred pauses, then nods, walks off dejectedly.\n\nCLOSE ON BRUCE\n\nHe wanders through the cave with glassy eyes, passing a table near the\nBatmobile.  On it - a new version of the battering ram.  Bruce picks it\nup, smiles bitterly, carries it in one hand as he continues to wander,\npassing the crime lab section.\n\nSuddenly - he lashes out - sends the battering ram flying through a set\nof glass beakers filled with chemicals.  Swinging it wildly now, he\ndestroys a section of the crime lab, then sinks heavily into a chair,\nhead bowed.\n\nEXTREME WIDE ANGLE\n\nThe cavernous Batcave.  The tiny, slumped figure of Bruce.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - WIDE ANGLE - DAY\n\nThe hot noonday sun drenches the spacious grounds of Wayne Manor.

WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nAlfred watches from the window, concerned, as O.S., the TELEPHONE\nstarts to RING.\n\nEXT. RUNNING TRACK - DAY\n\nCAMERA CLOSE on Bruce's grimly determined face, oblivious to the\nrivulets of sweat which pour down freely.  His body is encased in\nseveral layers of exercise clothes, deeply stained by perspiration,\nthat turn him into a human pressure cooker.  His legs churn like\ndisassociated pistons.\n\nBACK TO ALFRED\n\nThe telephone continues to RING.  Alfred turns, still distracted by the\nsight of Bruce and answers it.\n\nALFRED\n(into phone)\nMr. Wayne's residence...I'm sorry, he's\nnot available...No, as I told you previ-\nously, I don't know when that would be,\nbut if you'd care to leave another\nmessage...\n\nINT. CITY HALL OFFICE - DAY\n\nCAMERA CLOSE on the door to an inner office marked:  Special Assistant\nto the Mayor - Private.\n\nThe door opens as Silver exits into her outer office, followed by\nseveral NEEDY-LOOKING CONSTITUENTS.\n\nSILVER\n...I'll take it up with Mayor\nThorne.  Gotham needs an effective\nnetwork of daycare centers, and\ntomorrow night's charity opening of\nthe circus seems like a good place\nto start.\n\nThe Constituents thank her profusely.  Silver crosses to her\nSECRETARY's desk with a hopeful look.\n\nSILVER\nAny luck?\n\nSECRETARY\nNada.  Mr. Wayne seems to be perma-\nnently...unavailable.\n\nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nWayne Manor seems deserted under the glow of the moon.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE IN POOL\n\nThe Olympic-sized Wayne Manor swimming pool is illuminated by the glow\nof outdoor lights.  In it:  Bruce swims laps, knifing through the water\nwith powerful strokes.\n\nEXT. POOL - CLOSE ON BRUCE - NIGHT\n\nBruce churns through the water, eyes glazed with a total single-\nmindedness.  His speed is Olympian.  As he tilts his head to take\nanother gulp of air, he suddenly stops dead in the water as he sees:\n\nANGLE ON SILVER - HIS P.O.V.\n\nSilver emerges from the darkness, her glistening hair cascading down\nover an evening dress.  She carries a wooden tray with two glasses of\nchampagne on it, smiles as she faces a stunned Bruce who stands waist-\nhigh in the water.\n\nSILVER\nYou know, Bruce, you simply must\npick up your phone messages.\n\nBRUCE\n(careful pause)\nIf I did - what would they say?\n\nSILVER\nThat we were supposed to have dinner\ntonight.\n\nSilver smiles, kicks off her shoes.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nFor some strange reason, I thought you\nmight suddenly have an evening free.\n\n\nBRUCE\nSilver...look...\n(with difficulty)\nI...hope you won't misunderstand\nwhat I'm about to say...\n\nSILVER\nThere aren't going to be any more\nMisunderstandings between us, Bruce.\nAnd I warn you.\n\nSilver slowly and calmly begins walking down the steps into the pool,\ncarrying the tray with her.  The water rises above the hemline of her\nevening dress, heading up for her waist as she advance toward as\nastonished Bruce.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nI can be a very determined person.\n\nSilver arrives at Bruce, the water now up to her chest, letting the\nwooden tray with the champagne float on the surface next to them.  She\nhands him a glass, takes the other herself, raises it, stares deeply\ninto his eyes.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nTo no more misunderstandings.\n\nBruce smiles in spite of himself, tosses back his champagne, then\nstudies her unwavering gaze carefully.  Flipping the glass over his\nhead, he suddenly pulls her toward him, locking her in a passionate,\nhungry kiss.\n\nThey finally break.  Silver purrs, whispers into his ear.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nThere...see what I mean about mis-\nunderstandings?\n\nBRUCE\nNo.  What?\n\nSILVER\nWell just now - a moment ago - I\nthought you were being rude, not\ngetting out of the pool to say hello.\n(looks down; grins)\nI didn't realize you weren't wearing\na bathing suit.\n\nINT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nBruce lies naked under powder-blue silk sheets.  A lovely hand comes\nINTO FRAME, gently strokes his cheek.\n\nSILVER (O.S.)\nWhen I think of how many nights I've\nreached across an empty pillow, hoping\nmy hand would find that face...\n\nThen - a shining mane of hair as Silver, also naked, wraps him in a\ntight embrace.  They kiss.\n\nBRUCE\nThere's so much to explain.  And I'm\nnot quite sure I ever can.\n\nSILVER\nI don't need explanations.  I just\nwant whatever it was to evaporate.\nto simple disappear...\n\nShe rolls over, looks at him carefully.  A Police siren is heard\nfaintly in the distance.  Bruce blinks.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nDid you ever meet him?\n\nBRUCE\nWho?\n\nSILVER\nThe Batman.\n(smiles)\nEvery time I hear a siren.  I think\nof the Batman.\n\nBRUCE\nI...ran into him a few times.  Here\nand there.\n\nSilver smiles down tenderly, studying him.\n\nSILVER\nYou know...that night at the opera.  I\nnever believed that the real Batman\nwould show up like that in public -\nnot when he knew someone else's life\nwas on the line.\n\nBRUCE\n(deadly stare)\nYou're right.  He wouldn't.\n\nBruce suddenly breaks eye contact, unsure if she thinks she's talking\nabout Batman or to Batman.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nYou...met him too one night, didn't\nyou?  Commissiner Gordon told me he\ntook you home or something.\n\nSILVER\n(smiles; remembers)\nOr something.\n(pause)\nWhat can I say?  He was dashing, re-\nsourceful, strong - very sweet in\nhis own special way - all the\nthings you'd expect from the Batman.\n(grins)\nThe next morning I told Rupert I'd\nfallen madly in love with him.\n\nBRUCE\nYou don't say.\n\nSILVER\n(penetrating gaze)\nAnd what's more - I told Rupert I\nwas sure that the Batman...had\nfallen in love with me.\n\nThey look deeply into each other's eyes.  Silver smiles.\n\nBRUCE\nI...think I'm jealous.\n\nSILVER\nI think I'm in love.\n\nThey wrap themselves in each other passionately.\n\nEXT.

The head lowers OUT OF FRAME, then\nreappears, this time covered by a CLOWN MASK!\n\nThe Clown Figure hurries out of the tunnel, wearing a floor-lengthed\ngranny dress.\n\nBACK TO ARENA\n\nSeveral of the other Clowns have dispersed, running up into the\naudience as a DRUM ROLL is heard.  The Granny Clown edges over toward\nthe cage containing the big cats.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nOne Clown runs up the aisle past them with what seems to be a bucket of\nwater, spots Silver, flings the contents of the bucket at her!  Bruce\nand Silver flinch as a SHOWER OF CONFETTI blankets them to general\nlaughter and applause.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nNow let me direct your attention to\nthe trapeze and high wire.  Out\nstars of the evening - The Flying\nGraysons!\n\nANGLE ON GRAYSONS\n\nA family of aerialists.  The older Graysons, trim and athletic, stand\non one platform.  Their son, DICK, stands on the other.  He is in his\nmiddle teens, a handsome young man in immaculate physical shape.  He\ntakes hold of a trapeze, swings down.\n\nANGLE ON STANDS\n\nThe Clown who poured the confetti on Bruce and Silver watches through\npancake makeup with more than a passing interest.  Protruding from\nunderneath a large silly hat:  we see the edges of a startling green\nshock of hair.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nDick Grayson swings on the trapeze in a long, powerful arc, executes a\ndifficult flip into the arms of his father.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nBRUCE\nRemarkable.

He is the only flier\nin the world to accomplish this feet!\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nA DRUM ROLL is heard.  Dick swings down, picking up momentum, then back\nup, then down again.  On his third pass, he tries it:  revolves\ndizzyingly - MAKING FOUR COMPLETE SOMERSAULTS IN MID-AIR!  (Note:\nThere is, actually, only one person in the world who can do this, with\nRingling Bros.)  Dick completes the impossible feat to wild applause.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nOn their feet, applauding enthusiastically with the Crowd.\n\nANGLE ON CLOWN (JOKER)\n\nThe Clown (Joker) giggles under his breath, lifts one billowing sleeve\nof his oversized costume, begins to unbutton it.\n\nRINGMASTER (V.O.)\nThe Graysons will now perform their\nworld-famous maneuver on the high-\nwire - passing each other and\nexchanging positions - all without\na net!\n\nBACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nBoth starring up, wide-eyed.\n\nANGLE ON GRAYSONS\n\nThe older Graysons stand at either end of a high wire some seventy feet\noff the ground.

The Joker opens the billowing\nsleeve of his clown costume.  Popping out:  A LIVE FALCON.  It\nhesitates, then takes off!\n\nBACK TO GRAYSONS\n\nThey're face to face now, on the wire, preparing to pass each other\nabove the hushed Crowd.  Suddenly - the falcon flies into view, lands\nheavily on one end of the male Grayson's pole with a SHRIEK!  The\nsurprised man teeters - the wire trembles - the falcon suddenly flies\nat his face!  Both Grayson's tumble off the wire together, plummet\ndownward.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nAs his parents hit the ground heavily in front of him.\n\nANGLE ON BRUCE AND SILVER\n\nSilver screams in horror.

The Joker grins.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nThe Batman stares coldly, speaks in a icily clear voice.\n\nBATMAN\nI've risked my life to help this\ncity.

Didn't you want\nto do something about it?\n\nBRUCE\n(pause)\nYes.  For a while.  But then I...\n(looks down)\n...realized how fruitless it was.\n\nDICK\nWell that's not going to happen to\nme!\n\nDick rises from the table, looks over with total, piercing sincerity,\nhis eyes misting over again.\n\nDICK (CONT'D)\nListen, I'm...grateful for every-\nthing you've done for me - and for\nall you intend to do.  But if you\ncan't live with my promise, accept\nit, support it, even - then maybe\nwe've both made a mistake.\n(eyes glistening)\nMay I be excused now?\n\nBruce stares back, deeply moved, almost whispers.\n\nBRUCE\nYes.  Of course you can.\n\nDick hurries out the door.  Bruce grits his teeth, crumples up his\nnapkin, squeezing it into a tiny ball.\n\nBRUCE (CONT'D)\nDamn.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM INTERSECTION - NIGHT\n\nRupert Thorne walks briskly down the street, hat tipped low over his\nface, coat collar turned up against the night wind.  He arrives at a\ndeserted intersection, checks the cross street signs, then glances down\nat his watch impatiently.\n\nANGLE ON SIDE OF BUILDING\n\nTucked under a high ledge of a nearby building:  a mounted camera lens\nswivels, the moonlight glinting off its surface.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nRubbing his hands together.  Looking around at the empty streets,\nirritated.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\nYou're late.\n\nThorne's head snaps around at he VOICE.  He sees nothing.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\nWe shouldn't be seen together any-\nmore, Mr. Mayor.  You can't afford\nthe risk.\n\nThorne stares:  the Joker's Voice is coming from inside a short,\nstanding mailbox on the corner.\n\nThorne hesitates, then slowly moves to the mailbox, tilts back the\nletter slot, mutters, looking around nervously.\n\nTHORNE\nI feel like a Goddamn idiot...\n\nINT. JOKER'S LAIR - NIGHT\n\nThe Joker speaks into a microphone attached to a tiny transmitting set.\n\nA VIDEO SCREEN above shows Thorne standing by the mailbox.\n\nNOTE:  THIS SCENE TO BE INTERCUT AS REQUIRED:\n\nJOKER\nThat's what I felt like twenty years\nago, Thorne.  When I decided to start\noff your political career with a\n\"bang.\"  Remember Thomas Wayne?\n\nTHORNE\n(cold pause)\nEvery time I see his son.\n\nJOKER\nNo regrets now, Mr. Mayor.  It's\ntaken me too long to maneuver us\ninto a position of total control in\nthis city.  I've got the judges\nlined up, the public at your feet...\n(cold pause)\nYou owe me, Rupert Thorne.\n\nTHORNE\nIt's a two-way street.  Once I\nrelieve Commissioner Gordon of his\nduties, you'll have a free rein in\nGotham - less my cut.  And now that\nit's legal to shoot the Batman...\n\nJOKER\nWe have to find him first.  So far,\nit's been like looking for a virgin\nin a maternity ward.\n\nTHORNE\nThen don't find him.  Let him find\nYou.\n\nJOKER\nHow?  If the real Batman wouldn't\neven appear at the opera to save the\nMayor...\n\nTHORNE\nThe Batman wasn't in love with the\nMayor.  He is in love...with a\ncertain young lady.  Or so she tells\nme and I've never known her to lie.\n\nJOKER\nWhat is she, a mute?\n\nTHORNE\n(deadly)\nCareful.  You may be talking about\nthe future Mrs. Thorne.  I...want\nyou to kidnap her.\n\nJOKER\nNow take my wife - please...\n\nTHORNE\nThe girl is not to be harmed.  Once\nyou've killed Batman and made your\nescape - I'll call the police and\nrescue her.\n\nJOKER\nHer knight in shining armor.\n\nTHORNE\nSomething like that.\n\nJOKER\nI underestimated you, Thorne.  I always\nknew you were corrupt, but I had no\nidea you'd turn out to be such a\ndelightfully repellent human being.\n\nThe Joker cackles insanely.  Thorne spots someone coming, closes the\nslot, hurries off.\n\nAfter a beat, an ANCIENT WOMAN approaches the mailbox with a handful of\nletters.  She lowers the slot.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\n(outraged)\nDo you mind?  I'll never get these\npictures developed!\n\nThe Woman SCREAMS!  Her letters go flying up in the air as she hustles\ndown the street.  The insane giggle of the Joker trails off into the\nnight.\n\nINT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nSilver is dressed in a lacy, powder-blue slip, exits her dressing room,\ncombing her hair.  The DOORBELL RINGS.\n\nSILVER\n(crossing)\nWho is it?\n\nVOICE\n(through door)\nGotham Florists, lady.  For a Miss\nSt. Cloud.\n\nSilver looks through the peephole.\n\nANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE\n\nA DELIVERY BOY waits, head down, holding a bouquet.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nSilver opens the doors slightly, sticks her arm out.  The Delivery Boy\nthrusts the bouquet in her hand.\n\nDELIVERY BOY\nSay it with flowers...\n\nSILVER\nWhat a surprise!...\n\nShe inhales the aroma of the bouquet deeply.  Her eyes become glassy.\nShe drops to the floor.\n\nDELIVERY BOY\nWhat a straight man!\n\nHe swings the door open.  It is the Joker.\n\nINT. POLICE HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nThorne strides purposefully down the hallway, followed by a reluctant\nSergeant Haley.\n\nHALEY\n...I don't know, Your Honor.  I\nmean, you're the Mayor and all that\n-- but I work for the Commissioner.\n\nTHORNE\nAs of tomorrow morning, no one works\nfor the Commissioner.  I'm relieving\nhim of his duties.\n\nThey have arrived at Gordon's door.  Haley is shocked.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI assume you'll be staying on, Ser-\ngeant - as a loyal member of the\nforce?\n\nHALEY\nI...hope to, Sir.\n\nTHORNE\nThen open it.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nHaley's key opens the door.  They enter.  Thorne looks around, spots\nthe red phone connected to the Batcave.\n\nTHORNE\nAnyone have the bright idea to run a\ntrace on this.\n\nHALEY\nYes, sir.  First day it was installed.\nBut all we ever got back was an echo\nof our own number.  Guy's amazing,\nisn't he?\n\nTHORNE\nOh, he's a crafty one, all right.\nThanks, Haley.  That's all.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT\n\nDick Grayson descends the darkened staircase, dressed in his pajamas.\nHe hears a NOISE, sees a light coming from the study.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR STUDY - NIGHT\n\nAlfred is tidying up the study, turns as Dick appears.\n\nDICK\nAll right if I make a sandwich in\nthe kitchen, Alfred?\n\nALFRED\nWhy certainly, Master Grayson.  If I\nmay be of help...\n\nDICK\n(grin)\nI think I can handle it.  Thanks.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - NIGHT\n\nBruce sits at the computer, runs through a criminal history of the\nJoker on the video screen.  He pauses, looks off.\n\nANGLE ON BATPHONE\n\nThe red Batphone lights up, then dies.  Lights up, then dies.\n\nBACK TO BRUCE\n\nStaring.  Unsure.\n\nINT. WAYNE STUDY - NIGHT\n\nAlfred reaches to turn off the desk lamp.  Suddenly, the light from the\nlamp rises, then dies.  Rises, then dies.\n\nINT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nThorne sits, Batphone in hand, waits.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce crosses to the phone.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred presses the button under the desk.  The bottom drawer pops open.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce picks up the phone, listens.\n\nBACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE\n\nTHORNE\nBatman?\n(no reply)\nBatman - if you're there - this is\nMayor Rupert Thorne.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce listens silently, frowning.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred holds the extension, listens in as well.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nNOTE:  THIS CONVERSATION TO BE INTERCUT BETWEEN THORNE, BRUCE, AND\nALFRED AS REQUIRED:\n\nTHORNE\nThis...isn't easy for me, Batman,\nconsidering what I've said and done\nwhere you're concerned.  But I love\nSilver St. Cloud very much - and I\nhave reason to believe you do too.\n\nBruce and Alfred react in their respective locations.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI...dropped by to have a drink with\nher tonight.  The door was open,\nthere were signs of a struggle, and\nshe was gone.  The Joker left a\nplaying card - addressed to you.\n\nBruce's face sets darkly.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\n\"Dear Batman.  Crime fighters may come\nand go, but I carry on in the Great\nAmerican Tradition of violence.  I'm\ncalling my little caper, Slaughter In\nSilver.  Sorry I have to run now.\nWrite if you get work.\"\n\nBruce's eyes narrow, thinking.  Thorne's voice begins to crack\nemotionally over the phone.\n\nTHORNE (CONT'D)\nI...don't know where they took her\n...or why the note was left for you.\nI only know that Silver means more\nthan my life to me, and I beg you to\nfind her and save her.  You're her\nonly chance, Batman, I...\n\nThorne's voice dies away theatrically.  He hangs up.\n\nBACK TO BATCAVE\n\nBruce hangs up, stares coldly.  His jaw twitches.\n\nBACK TO STUDY\n\nAlfred hangs up in the study, worried.\n\nBACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE\n\nThorne takes a deep breath, smiles, rises, exits.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nDick has made his sandwich, closes the refrigerator door, starts off\nfor the hallway.\n\nANGLE ON HALLWAY ENTRANCE\n\nDick enters the dark hallway, starts for the stairs as he sees:\n\nANGLE ON ALFRED - HIS P.O.V.\n\nAlfred rushes out of the study, heading for the living room.  He slips,\nfalls heavily, picks himself up, oblivious to the pain, rushes into the\nliving room.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nWatching.  He starts for the stairs, then stops, now curiously heads\nfor the living room himself.\n\nINT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nDick enters, look around in amazement:  Alfred is nowhere to be seen!\nHis eyes scan the room for any other exit.\n\nANGLE ON GRANDFATHER CLOCK - DICK'S P.O.V.\n\nThe tall grandfather clock stands against one wall.  A thin shaft of\nlight seems to be emanating from behind it.\n\nDick advances to the clock, looks down, puzzled.  It seems to be\nstanding at a slight angle away from the wall.  Exploring the edge of\nthe clock with his hand, he starts to pull back.  The clock swivels,\nrevealing:\n\nANGLE DOWN INTO BATCAVE - DICK'S P.O.V.\n\nThe Batcave - with all its trophies, computers - in all its regal\nsplendor.  Alfred is standing near the gleaming Batmobile, looks off\nwith concern.\n\nNow emerging from the shadows - THE BATMAN!  Dressed in his full\nregalia, heading quickly toward Alfred and the Batmobile.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nStaring down, his jaw slack.  Stunned.\n\nINT. BATCAVE - NIGHT\n\nBatman crosses to Alfred, who stares with deadly concern.\n\nALFRED\nDon't go, Sir.\n\nBATMAN\nPlease get out of my way, Alfred.\n\nALFRED\nSince when have you trusted Rupert\nThorne?  You don't even know where\nyou're meant to be going.\n\nBATMAN\nThe clues in the note were obvious.\nThe \"Great American Tradition\" line?\nThat's the name of this year's series\nof exhibits at the Gotham Museum.\nAnd \"Write if you get work\"?  This\nmonth it's on American writers and\nWriting.\n\nALFRED\nIf the clues are that obvious, they\nmust want you to come.  It's a\ntrap, can't you see that?\n\nBATMAN\nThat boy up there thinks the Batman\nkilled his parents.  I told him he\ncouldn't live his whole life chasing\na ghost.  What I realize now is - I\ncan't live the rest of my life\nbeing a ghost.\n\nBACK TO DICK\n\nListening at the top of the stairs.  Thunderstruck.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nBatman puts an arm on Alfred's shoulder.\n\nBATMAN\nIf I come back, old friend, I'll\nexplain things to Dick.  Tell him\nthe truth and have the Joker to\nprove it.\n(pause)\nAnd if I don't - take care of him,\nAlfred.  He'll be in much better\nhands than he has been in mine.\n\nAlfred silently steps aside as Batman enters the Batmobile, roars off\nthrough the cave.\n\nAlfred pauses sadly, then turns back, heading for the staircase again.\nHe looks up.\n\nANGLE ON DICK - ALFRED'S P.O.V.\n\nDick stands at the top of the stairs, staring down, grimly determined,\nhis face carved in granite.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM ROOFTOPS - NIGHT\n\nBatman's silhouette as he leaps and glides effortlessly across the tops\nof buildings.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\nThe deserted museum with the billboard:  GREAT AMERICAN TRADITIONS.\nThis month:  American Writers and Writing.\n\nEXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT\n\nThe museum roof is a network of vaulted glass skylights.  TWO THUGS\nstand on a surrounding catwalk.\n\nCLOSE ON CATWALK\n\nA sharp metallic \"ping\" is heard across the catwalk.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe Thugs look up.  One pulls a gun.\n\nTHUG\nThe Batman...\n\nBATMAN'S VOICE\nCount on it.\n\nThey wheel.  Batman stands directly behind them.  He grabs the first\nThug, swivels him as the second Thug fires - killing his partner.\nBatman shoves the dead man into the second Thug, as both bodies crash\ndown through the glass skylight.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - UP ANGLE - NIGHT\n\nThe bodies explode through the glass, falling some sixty feet to the\nfloor.  Then - total silence.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStaring down through the broken glass.  Listening.  He pulls a tiny\nrevolver from his belt.  A barbed metal dart sticks out of the barrel.\nBatman aims it through the hole, fires.\n\nANGLE ON MUSEUM RAFTERS\n\nThe dart embeds itself deeply into a rafter.  Attached to it is a white\nnylon cord.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nSecuring the other end of the cord.  He hooks himself to it with a\nclip, glides through the opening in the glass.\n\nBACK TO RAFTERS\n\nBatman shoots silently along the cord to a rafter, lands gracefully,\nlooks down.\n\nANGLE DOWN ON MUSEUM - HIS P.O.V.\n\nThrough the dim, eerie light.  This exhibit (like the one including the\ngiant penny) consists of huge, outsized version of everyday items.  In\nthis case - the tools of a writer's trade:  enormous pencils, erasers,\nquill pens, fountain pens, ink wells, a ten-foot-high pencil sharpener,\ntall volumes of famous American novels, etc.\n\nIn the center of the display - a giant electric typewriter, some thirty\nfeet wide.  A huge sheet of blank white paper is rolled up on it.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStaring down curiously through the silent darkness.  His gaze starts to\nwander, then suddenly spots something.\n\nBACK TO TYPEWRITER\n\nA FIGURE attached to the typewriter now moves.  It is Silver, hooked\nonto the ribbon near the center of the page.  She moans, still\nrecovering from the effects of the drugs.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nEyes widening.  He hooks one end of a nylon cord to a rafter, launches\nhimself, swinging down toward Silver.\n\nBACK TO RAFTER\n\nA hand with a knife reaches out, slices through the cord!\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nNow plummeting like a rock.  He falls into the typewriter in front of\nSilver, his cape suddenly catching on something, partially ripping it,\njerking him to a stop.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe lights are turned on.  Emerging from behind or under the various\nexhibits:  thirty or forty GOONS.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman hangs helplessly from the circular element ball which prints out\nthe characters on the page.  His cape is caught on the projected edge\nof one of the giant letters.  He stares ahead, unable to extricate\nhimself.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nThe glaring lights have brought Silver back to consciousness.  Hooked\nto the huge ribbon near the center of the page, she suddenly spots\nBatman across from her.\n\nSILVER\n(horrified)\nOh, my God...\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nStepping out onto the end of the carriage - the Joker!\n\nJOKER\nI knew you'd drop in, Batman.\nYou're that type of guy.\n(insane giggle)\nGet it?  Type?\n\nThe forty Goons circle in around the typewriter.  The Joker nods to two\nof them.\n\nCLOSE ON SWITCH\n\nTwo Goons give a mighty heave, flip the \"ON\" lever.  A loud hum is\nheard as the typewriter activates.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nRupert Thorne hides in the shadows behind a large pencil box, watches\nthe scene.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nYou know, you're nothing to write\nhome about, Batman - but let's give\nit a try.\n\nThe Joker points a gun down at the keyboard.\n\nJOKER\nWhat letter could be hiding under\nyour cape?  A \"D', maybe?\n\nThe Joker fires:\n\nCLOSE ON LETTER \"D\"\n\nThe bullet hits the letter \"D\", depressing it.\n\nCLOSE ON BATMAN\n\nThe element ball carrying Batman shifts, hurtles toward the page with\nblinding speed.  It \"cracks\" against the paper sharply, imprinting a\n\"D\".  Batman's head has stopped mere inches from the page.\n\nANGLE ON SILVER\n\nEyes welded shut - terrified.  The printing of the letter has advanced\nthe ribbon.  She is perilously close to the exact center of the page.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nNot the \"D\".  Hmm.  The most common\nletter is \"E\"...\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nThe Joker fires!  Batman flies toward the page, this time nearly\nsquashed on the other side.  A giant \"E\" has been imprinted.  Silver\nadvances one more position on the ribbon.\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nAn \"A\", maybe...\n\nThe element ball spins, hurtles toward the paper again.  It splats into\nthe page, narrowly missing Batman, pushing Silver along again.\nImmediately - another shot - the ball whizzes back, prints another \"D\".\n\nJOKER (CONT'D)\nI know I tried the \"D\" before, but I\nsimply couldn't resist.\n\nWIDER ANGLE\n\nThe message on the page reads \"DEAD\".  The trembling Silver is only one\nletter away from being obliterated.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nStruggling, but helpless.  His eyes flash nervously.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nAlarmed as he sees what could happen to Silver.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nI know what letter is hidden under\nyour cape, by the way.  It's \"B\" -\nfor Batman.  But you see, I've got a\nproblem.  If I hit the letter \"B\",\nMiss St. Cloud will die, and I pro-\nmised not to kill her.\n\nBACK TO THORNE\n\nGrim.  Pulling a gun.\n\nBACK TO JOKER\n\nJOKER\nTo \"B\" or not to \"B\"...That seems to\nbe the question.  Well, I suppose\npromises - like laws - are made to\nbe broken.\n\nVOICE\nI made a promise, too, Joker.  The\nnight you killed my parents.\n\nQUICK CUTS:\n\nThorne looks up.  Silver looks up.  Batman looks up.  The Joker looks\nup.\n\nANGLE ON ROBIN - THEIR P.O.V.\n\nDick Grayson stands high in the rafters.\n\nDICK\nI promised to wipe filthy crud like\nyou off the face of the earth.\n\nJOKER'S VOICE\nShoot him!\n\nThere is a hail of gunfire as Dick flies down through the air toward\nthe typewriter.\n\nDick lands on the \"TAB\" key.  The carriage releases, shoots across the\ntypewriter, carrying the Joker with it.  He flies off the end, crashes\nsickeningly into the wall, drops to the floor, unconscious.\n\nDick bounces off the \"TAB\", flies across the keyboard, lands on the\n\"SHIFT\" key.\n\nDICK\nThat ought to give you a lift,\nBatman!\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nThe \"SHIFT\" swivels the element ball 180-degress to expose the capital\nletters.  Batman is swung to the front, grabs the carriage, pulls\nhimself up, looks down as Dick launches himself into a pile of Goons\nlike a human dynamo.\n\nBATMAN\nLeave a few for me, son!\n\nBatman leaps off the carriage, joins Dick in the fray.\n\nNOTE:  The fight which follows will be outrageous and thrilling, but\nshould look physically believable.  The Dynamic Duo will overpower the\ngang using the following elements and devices:\n\nA. Dick flinging Goons back into the pointed tips of quill pens.\n\nB. Batman lifting a fountain pen lever, firing a river of ink at an\nonrushing group.\n\nC. Both of them using springy, huge erasers as launching platforms.\n\nD. Oversized volumes of literature slamming shut on the villains.\n\nE. Enormous bookmarks and letter openers swung as clubs, knocking out\nthree or four crooks at a time.\n\nF. Heavies being hurled into huge, deep ink wells, turning them sopping\nblack wet, unable to climb out again.\n\nG. Dick bashing a pair of Thugs back into the side of the giant pencil\nsharpener.  They slam back against the \"ON\" button, activating it.\n\nDuring the chaos, Rupert Thorne has made his way down the typewriter's\nsteel bar which holds the paper to the roller.  He unhooks Silver,\nlifts her to safety.\n\nSILVER\nRupert?  What...\n\nTHORNE\nDon't talk.  Let's go.\n\nThe fight continues as Rupert and Silver run down the bar, drop off the\ntypewriter, cross the floor through the furious melee, heading for the\ndoor.  Batman rounds the corner of a giant book.  Silver spots him,\nstops.\n\nSILVER\nBatman?...Batman!...\n\nThorne yanks at her.  She tries to pull away, sees two Goons coming up\nbehind Batman.\n\nSILVER\nBruce!  Look out!\n\nBatman ducks, rolls, trips the Goons, knocks their heads together.\nSilver rushes toward him as Thorne pulls a gun, realizing.\n\nTHORNE\nBruce...Bruce Wayne...\n\nBATMAN\nSilver!  Get away!\n\nDick has bashed a Goon backwards - he careens across the floor, hits\nSilver from the side, knocking her into Batman as Thorne fires.\n\nCLOSE ON SILVER\n\nBlood spurts quickly across the lacy back of Silver's powder-blue slip.\nBatman hooks an arm around her, stares into her dying face, struck\ndumb.\n\nSILVER\n(trembling)\nI'm...right...aren't I...Bruce.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nHorrified.  He turns, runs.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nGiving chase.  Dodging bullets as Thorne fires at him.\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nLowering Silver to the floor.  She's barely breathing.  Thorne's\ngunfire echoes through the museum.  Batman's jaw twitches.  His eyes\nflash with rage.\n\nANGLE ON DICK\n\nDick rounds the corner of a giant prop some ten feet high off the\nfloor.  Thorne waits for him on the next prop - gun poised and ready.\nDick spots him, freezes.\n\nTHORNE\nI don't know what part you play in\nall this, kid.  But it's turned out\nto be a one-night stand.\n\nBATMAN'S VOICE\n(roaring with rage)\nMay God damn you, Rupert Thorne!\n\nBACK TO BATMAN\n\nBatman has placed a huge, viciously sharp thumbtack in a giant rubber\nband pulled taut.  He lets it fly.\n\nANGLE ON THORNE\n\nThe thumbtack spears Thorne in the chest, topples him back across the\nprop - which is the giant pencil sharpener - he falls into the hole:  A\ndisappearing scream is cut short as Thorne is ground to death.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman kneels, cradles Silver's head in his lap.  Her eyes flutter open\npainfully.  She tries to smile.\n\nSILVER\nHello...Bruce...\n\nHe stares down, eyes filled with tears.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nMaybe...it's better, you know?\nI'd...just...get in the way...\n\nBATMAN\n(low whisper)\nDon't...\n\nSILVER\nI could...never really have you, and\n...I could never fall in love with\nsomeone else.\n\nHer eyelids tremble.  One of his tears hits her cheek softly.  She\nreaches up, gently caresses his chin.\n\nSILVER (CONT'D)\nPoor...darling...you're the one...\nwho's...left behind...\n\nHer eyes close.  Her face relaxes, dead.  Tears stream heavily down\nBatman's cowl.\n\nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\nINT. MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\nCommissioner Gordon supervises the aftermath and cleanup,  The Joker,\nstill groggy, handcuffed, is yanked along by a COP.\n\nJOKER\nTake it easy, okay?  I get winded\nopening clams.\n\nHe is led away.  Gordon stares across the room.\n\nANGLE ON BATMAN\n\nBatman stands by Silver's body which has been placed on a gurney.  TWO\nPARAMEDICS cover her face with a blanket.\n\nBATMAN\nWait.\n\nThey stop.  He reaches in, pulls back the blanket, stares down at her\nface.  Gordon has crossed to join him.\n\nGORDON\nWhat a Goddamn shame.  You know\nwho's going to be really broken up\nabout this - Bruce Wayne.\n\nBatman turns, glances at Gordon blankly.\n\nGORDON (CONT'D)\nThey were real close, you know.  Or\nmaybe you didn't.\n\nGordon turns, paces thoughtfully.\n\nGORDON (CONT'D)\nBut at least you're back, I'm\nback, and all's right with this\ncrazy world for a second.  Now I\ndon't know where the hell this kid\nthey're talking about went to,\nbut...\n\nHe turns, looks.  Batman has disappeared.\n\nEXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - DAWN\n\nThe gurney carrying Silver's body is loaded into an ambulance.  It\ntakes off, red lights flashing, siren wailing.  The rising sun is just\nbeginning to crack the clouds on the horizon.  CAMERA WIDENS, STARTS TO\nRISE:\n\nThe ambulance becomes a tiny red dot as we now view the magnificent\ndowntown section of Gotham.\n\nCAMERA CONTINUES TO RISE, SHOOTING UP some eighty stories, then ninety,\nthen one hundred, finally revealing:\n\nWE DISSOLVE AS:\n\nThe dark, majestic figure of the Batman, standing on the top edge of\nthe tallest building in Gotham.  He looks down silently, cape billowing\nout behind him, a regal black prince surveying his steel and concrete\nrealm.\n\nNow swinging up and across from a nearby lower building:\n\nTHE IMPOSING, GRIM-FACED, COLORFUL FIGURE OF ROBIN!  Dressed in his\ngreen shirt, red vest, flowing yellow cape and black mask, he lands on\nthe roof noiselessly.\n\nBatman's eyes acknowledge his presence without turning.  Robin\nadvances, then stops silently, several paces behind.\n\nThe DYNAMIC DUO has been joined.  Both for now, and for the future\nadventures which await them in Gotham.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nTHE ENDEmbed"

        "lyrics": "Terry Gilliam\u2019s Watchmen LyricsFADE IN:\n\n1. EXT. NEW YORK - LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY\nThe STATUE OF LIBERTY stands watch at the mouth of the Hudson.  Over\nscene, we SUPER TITLE:\n\nNEW YORK CITY - JULY 1976\n\n2. JERSEY CITY PIER - DAY\nA live news update.  Network correspondent CINDY CHAN stands at the\nedge of the  dock, the statue plainly visible in the distance behind\nher.\nCINDY\n-- insist that the situation is under control.  Authorities have just\nagreed to the release of nine Radical Front prisoners in hopes of\nfreeing the hostages.\n(adjusting her hair)\nWe repeat: terrorists have taken Liberty Island, and are holding some\nforty hostages -- including tourists and maintenance workers --\ncaptive in the Statue of Liberty itself.\n\n3. FERRYBOAT - DAY\nThe ferry -- one of six anchored a half-mile off Liberty Island --\nhas been commandeered by a fully-armed SWAT TEAM.  The SWAT CAPTAIN,\nwho's in charge of negotiations, speaks to the terrorists via\nwalkie-talkie.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nYour demands have been met.  The prisoners and the money are on their\nway.  If you tune your TV to Channel 4 you'll see the copters\npreparing for takeoff.\n\n4. INT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT\nThe screen of a portable TV shows THREE HELICOPTERS lifting off from\nLaguardia.  We're in the OBSERVATION ROOM inside the statue's head.\nA TERRORIST holds a crowd of SQUEALING TOURISTS -- men, women,\nschoolchildren -- at bay with an automatic rifle.  Two others stand\nby the windows, scanning the harbor for signs of a double-cross; and\na fourth, the RINGLEADER, speaks into a walkie-talkie.\nRINGLEADER\nGood.  We got forty innocent people here.  One false move . . . and\nwe blow her brains out.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)\n(filter; from walkie-talkie)\nBlow whose brains out?\n\n5. EXT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT\nTIGHT on the ring of OBSERVATION WINDOWS situated just below the\njutting spikes of the CROWN.  CAMERA PULLS BACK rapidly to take in\nthe whole of the statue's head.\n\nRINGLEADER (O.S.)\n(a nasty laugh)\nLady Liberty, my friend.  Lady Liberty's brains!\n\n6. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nMOUNTING TENSION among the SWAT TEAM on deck.\n\nSWAT COP\nSons of bitches.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nRelax.  We'll nail 'em on the transfer.  Let's get those hostages out\nfirst.\nSWAT COP II\nCaptain . . . what the hell is that?\n\nAll eyes turn upward.  In the distance, a TINY SPECK descends from\nthe clouds and drops, in a perfectly vertical line, toward the head\nof the statue.  The SWAT CAPTAIN hoists a pair of binoculars:\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nShit.  Shit fire!!\n\nSWAT COP\nSir!  What is it?\n\n7. POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS\nA magnified view of the SPECK, which turns out to be a futuristic,\nblimplike HOVERCRAFT -- the OWLSHIP.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)\nChrist almighty, it's the goddamned Watchmen!\n\n8. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nIn the cabin we find THREE COSTUMED SUPERHEROES: the red-and-gold\nsuited CAPTAIN METROPOLIS; RORSCHACH, whose face is a shifting\ninkblot mask; and NIGHT OWL, who's manning the instrument panel.\n\nNIGHT OWL\nOkay, Adrian, we're in position.  What now?\n\nHe looks up at a monitor mounted over the controls.  ADRIAN VEIDT,\nblond scientific wizard, answers pensively from Watchmen HQ:\n\nVEIDT\n(on monitor)\nLet's take out their communications.  Drop the scrambler.\n\n9. EXT. HEAD OF STATUE - DAY\nA line drops from the OWLSHIP, and an ELECTRONIC DEVICE lands with a\nthud on the dome of Lady Liberty's crown.\n\n10. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nTERRORISTS staring at the portable TV screen; suddenly, it shows\nnothing but snow.  The RINGLEADER, suspicious, lifts his\nwalkie-talkie:\n\nRINGLEADER\nHey.  We got a problem here --\n\nHe releases the button.  No reply -- only loud, hissing STATIC.\n\nRINGLEADER\nCome in.  Do you read me?  Don't play around with us,\nGoddammit !\n\n11. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT\nThe SWAT CAPTAIN curses at his useless walkie-talkie.  Teeth bared,\nhe glowers up at the OWLSHIP and paces the deck in a psychotic\nfrenzy.\n\nSWAT COP\nIgnorant bastards!  They've jammed us!\n\nSWAT COP II\nWhat do we do now?\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nWe sit here with our thumbs up our butts.  As usual.\n\n12. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nA HULKING FIGURE, outfitted in SCUBA GEAR, emerges from the water.\nThere's an evil-looking RIFLE slung over his shoulder.  As he\nswaggers toward the base of the statue, he peels off his wetsuit to\nreveal yet another gaudy COSTUME underneath.\n\nSuperhero #4: THE COMEDIAN.  He pins a BADGE to his leather\nbreastplate; incongruously, it's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON -- and it\nmatches his own nasty SMILE as he marches forward into battle.\n\n13. INT. BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nA TRIO OF TERRORISTS standing guard near the entrance in the base of\nthe statue.  They're holding a JANITOR at gunpoint.  One of them is\nfumbling with his walkie-talkie, which has inexplicably gone\nhaywire.\n\nTERRORIST I\nBase to head.  Base to head.  Come in!\n(flustered)\nI can't get shit!\n\nTERRORIST II\nWhat the hell is going on??\n\nThere's a sudden metallic CLANG behind them.  They turn in unison --\njust as the COMEDIAN struts into frame, assault rifle in hand.\n\nPanic.  The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of\na long metal stairway.  One of them grabs the JANITOR, holds a gun to\nhis head.\n\nTERRORIST I\nI'M NOT JOKING!!\n\nThe COMEDIAN shrugs: okay.  He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED\nSHOTS directly into the JANITOR's gut.  The old man's body jerks twice\nand he slumps to the floor, stone dead.\n\nThe TERRORISTS stand there aghast.  For an instant they're too\nstunned to shoot.  The COMEDIAN breaks into a dopey grin --\n\nCOMEDIAN\nThe joke's on you.\n\n-- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As\nthe saying goes . . . it's nice to see a man who enjoys his work.\n\n14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nRORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor\nof the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --\n\n15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nA sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to\nthe nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL\nFIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.\n\nWhile the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point\nbehind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS\nand RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the\nstatue's upraised TORCH.\n\nThe TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the\nfar side of the torch.\n\nRINGLEADER\nI don't like this.  Go downstairs and see what's up.\n\n16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nRORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.\n\nRORSCHACH\nGot your flashgun?\n\nCAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and\ngoes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits\nbehind.\n\n17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nThe COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue's layout.\nHe spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor,\nthen strolls over and jimmies it open.\n\nANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one's different.\nThis one's a WOMAN.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nAbout time.  It stinks down there.\n\nCOMEDIAN\nB-team's upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.\n\nAs the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched\nwetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME\nunderneath.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nWhy do I get all the glamour jobs?\n\nCOMEDIAN\nA woman's work is never done.\n\n18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nThe TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later,\nCAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their\nguns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a\nTEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.\n\nRINGLEADER\nI don't know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.\n\nCAPT. METROPOLIS\nPlease.  There's something I'd like you to see first.\n\nHe holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer's flash.\nAll at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding\nlight has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the\nfloor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.\n\nAll except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who's wearing his special sunglasses.\nHe pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.\n\n19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER\nAn edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he's grabbed\nfrom behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at\nhis throat.\n\nCOMEDIAN\nOkay, Abdul.  Where's the bomb?\n\n20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nEveryone's slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the\nTERRORISTS tied up; he's consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.\n\nCAPT. METROPOLIS\nDon't cry, little one.  You're in good hands.\n(standing; to the crowd)\nNow everyone.  Listen carefully.  We're going out through the torch.\n\nHe goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the\ntorch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.\n\n21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER\nA METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH\nsecures it to the tip of the torch.\n\n22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT\nSILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nShould be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .\n\nCOMEDIAN\nJust barge in.  While they're staring at your tits we'll blow their\nballs off.\n\nThey look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead\nlanding.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist\nhits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the\nlanding.\n\n23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER\nGas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS' BOMB, and it's a big fat one, sits\nin a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with\nUNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the\nCOMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:\n\nCOMEDIAN\nWell.  They look distracted.\n(turning to face her)\nDon't suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nEddie -- !\n\nSuddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He\nturns.\n\nOne of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself\nover to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A\nSWITCH on the housing.\n\nA TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.\n\nCOMEDIAN\nSHIT!\n\nHe hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to\nblink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An\nempty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nWhat about the --\n\nCOMEDIAN\nFUCK 'EM!\n\nThere's a mountain-climber's CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it\naround the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only\na second before following suit.\n\n24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nCAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once,\nhe FREEZES.  There's a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as\nwell.\n\n25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nYET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL's instrument panel.\nHe looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.\n\nNIGHT OWL\nAdrian!\n\nVEIDT\nYeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.\n\nNIGHT OWL\nWell, good God, we can't just --\n\nVEIDT\nMission aborted, Daniel!\n\nNIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.\n\n26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT\nOn the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.\n\n27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER\nThe COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS\nthrowing off sparks against the cable.\n\n28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nCAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands\npressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and\nRORSCHACH, who's hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off\nthe torch.\n\n29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT\nTHE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE\ntouches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator\ndoors open, and the two of them dive through.\n\n30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER\nRORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP\nstreaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure\nof Lady Liberty.\n\nThree beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.\n\n31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nA heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an\noverhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.\n\n32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER\nSmoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat\nagainst a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling\nDEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.\n\n33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER\nThe furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of\nthe statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He\nturns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nThat's it.  I quit.\n\nThe water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --\n\n34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY\n-- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through\nthe harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the\ndemolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes\nwondering what the hell happened to his date.\n\nMeet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR.\nMANHATTAN.\n\nDown below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact --\nare crawling out of the wreckage.  The COMEDIAN looks up at the huge\nblue figure looming over them, and shakes a gnat-sized fist:\n\nCOMEDIAN\nASSHOLE!  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!?\n\nCUT TO:\n\n35. INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT\nThe Channel 4 Newsroom, with anchors SHEILA SHEA and JIM BRADLEY.\n\nSHEILA\nIn the face of mounting public pressure, the city of New York has\nrevoked its contract with Adrian Veidt's super-team.  Local police\nhave threatened a city-wide walkout if criminal charges against the\nWatchmen are dropped.\n\nOn the bluescreen behind them, red circles with diagonal crossbars\nsurround SIX HEAD SHOTS of the individual WATCHMEN.\n\nJIM\nAnd in Washington today, the Senate introduced legislation which\nwould ban all costumed adventurers nationwide.  Easy passage\nis expected.\n(shuffling his papers)\nWell, Sheila, it looks like the age of the superhero is officially\nhistory.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n36.  CREDITS SEQUENCE\nTIMEPIECES of every description -- pocket watches, grandfather\nclocks, travel alarms, all perfectly synchronized -- DRIFT UPWARD\nthrough a vast black void, ticking off the seconds.  At the stroke of\nmidnight, GONGS sound, BUZZERS buzz, BELLS tinkle -- and without\nwarning the clocks EXPLODE.  As gears and coils and crystals cascade\ndownward through the void, we SUPER TITLE:\n\nWATCHMEN\n\nFADE THROUGH TO:\n\n37. EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT\nDarkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we TILT\nUP the towering facade of a forty-story apartment building.  A BLIMP\ndrifts lazily through distant clouds; the sounds of traffic echo\nfaint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse -- where\nheavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a SHATTERED\nPLATE-GLASS WINDOW.  SUPER TITLE:\n\nNEW YORK CITY - TEN YEARS LATER\n\n38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nA ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by\nthe garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the\nhigh-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated\nbubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on\ntheir roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.\n\nA CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: \"NEW SKIRMISH ON\nAFGHAN BORDER.  RUSSKIES WALK OUT ON PEACE POWWOW.\"\n\nCUSTOMER\nCrazy reds don't know who they're messing with.\n(indicating the cop cars)\nWhat happened over there?\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nSome guy went sidewalk divin'  Twenny-five cents.\n\n39. EXT. HIGH-RISE - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT\nA riot of noise and color.  A plainclothes COP takes a statement from\nthe DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare\nwith sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.\n\nPATROLMAN\nSTAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!\n\nWe are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of\nreality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the\ncity -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance:\nhis standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his\nplastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears\na path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the\nback of a waiting ambulance.\n\nDET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and\nbuttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the\ninvestigation.\n\nBURNS\nHad a lot of blood in him.\n\nHYDE\nYou oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.\n\nBURNS\nNo idea who's behind this?\n\nHYDE\nSmall army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.\n\nBURNS nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window.\n\nBURNS\nHe would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a\ncall from Washington.\n\nHYDE\nWashington?\n\nBURNS\nThey want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.\n\nHYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after\nthe ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.\n\n40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nTIGHT ON a large placard: \"THE END IS NIGH.\"  The bearer of the sign,\na hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk\nspreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make\nout an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.\n\nThe NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his\ncollar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against\nthe kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick,\ncross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in\nresponse and plugs on.\n\nAt the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the\nsidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET\nCRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain\ngrate.\n\nIt's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its\nsurface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to\nmidnight.\n\nThe STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.  He stares off at the\nshattered window some forty stories above.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n41. INT. HIGH-RISE - HALLWAY - NIGHT\nCAMERA DRIFTS from the penthouse elevator down a long, plush-carpeted\ncorridor.  The hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading\n\"POLICE LINE -- DO NOT CROSS.\"  At the far end is a single door,\nSEALED OFF.\n\n42. INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT\nMOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and\noverturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture\nwindow.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are\nflapping wildly.\n\nA ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.\n\nSHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps\ninside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is\ninvisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the\nroom.\n\nThe apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints,\ngaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The\nflashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS\nand an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.\n\nThe INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains\nof a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky\nglass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for\nhis face.\n\nHe has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and\never-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should\nbe. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.\n\nWe've met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.\n\n43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk\ndainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood.\nOffhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL.\nHe tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his\ntrenchcoat pocket.\n\n44. INT. PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nThe beam shines across rumpled bedclothes, searches around the walls,\nand settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in closet.\nRORSCHACH steps inside, examines rack upon rack of expensive\nsuits.\n\nHe shoves the suits aside.  Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on\nthe wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP.\nTHUMP.\n\nHe pauses.  He's found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully\nalong the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a\nCONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing\na SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.\n\nHe reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a\nbizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit,\nrows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed\nPHOTOGRAPH.\n\nRORSCHACH examines the photo.  It's a group shot, six men, one woman,\nall dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is\nwearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN's\ncostume.\n\nThey're all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT.\nMETROPOLIS.  DR. MANHATTAN.  ADRIAN VEIDT.  And of course, RORSCHACH\nhimself.  As he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by, we\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n45. EXT. STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT\nA LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner\nstore.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with\nthe heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated\n-- old before his time.\n\nHe holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough\nto open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.\n\n46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT\nIn an alleyway just off the access street, there's a MUGGING in\nprogress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in\nknot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG\nsees what's happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious\ndecision to move on.  Then --\n\nVOICE\nHold up, papa-san!\n\nThe KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and\nspotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they\nmarch toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them,\nalmost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we\n\nCUT TO:\n\n47. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE\nSlow-mo, double-frame, or sepia-tone; you call it.  But whatever the\ngimmick, it should suggest that the events we're watching take place\nin a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.\n\nIt's out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in\nan alleyway not unlike the one we've just left.  There's a flurry of\nfists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--\n\n-- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME,\ntransporting us back to:\n\n48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT\nReal-time again.  Our reverie's been interrupted by a SHAFT OF\nWHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the\nalley.\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nHALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --\n\nThe KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the\nLIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair\nsome forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of\nthe kids.\n\nDREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the\nalleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past\nhelp.\n\n49. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nTHREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The\nsecurity system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN's\napartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.\n\nDREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs\nit carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for\nthe kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most\npeculiar sight:\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . Rorschach.\n\n50. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\nLeaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is\nthe aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up,\nexposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he's calmly eating a plate of\nbaked beans.\n\nDREIBERG\nHow did you get in here?\n\nIgnoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping,\nutterly emotionless whisper:\n\nRORSCHACH\nHiya, pardner.  Long time no see.\n\nDREIBERG\nDid anybody follow you?  See you come here?\n\nDREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn't care less --\nemits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can\nonto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup\nfrom a squeeze bottle.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nI can't believe you're back on the streets.  Good God, man, you're\nwanted on fourteen counts of murder.\n\nRORSCHACH\nAt least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.\n\nHe reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it\nto DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his\nfingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nLook familiar?\n\nDREIBERG\nSure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHuman bean juice.\n(beat)\nThe Comedian is dead.\n\nDREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture.\nHis jaw goes slack.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nHad a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up --\nbeautiful view.\nHope he enjoyed it on the way down.\n\nDREIBERG\nJesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?\n\nRORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nWell, God, he'd been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he\nmust've had enemies.\n\nRORSCHACH\nSo do I.  So do you.\n\nDREIBERG\nRorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just\nparanoia.\n\nRORSCHACH's head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG\nblinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But\nRORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the\nfront door.\n\nRORSCHACH\nMaybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with\na grudge.\n(pause)\nThought you might want to spread the word.\n\nDREIBERG\nHey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?\n\nRORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He\nopens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.\n\nRORSCHACH\nYou the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.\n\nHe reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo\nfrom the COMEDIAN's wall.  A moment later, he's gone.\n\nDREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone,\nCAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple\ntunic and mask . . .\n\n51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT\nA GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is\nfar from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome\ndesk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is\nADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he's\nDREIBERG's age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and\npale, he looks thirty.  When he's sixty he'll look forty.\n\nVEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic\npatents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his\noffice reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the\nlike.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE\nRINGS.\n\nVEIDT\nVeidt here.\n\n52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT\nDREIBERG\nAdrian?  Listen, it's Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach.\nI had to call you before he --\n\nVEIDT\nDaniel, slow down.  What's this about Rorschach?\n\nDREIBERG\nThe Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.\n\nVEIDT\nMy God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?\n\nDREIBERG\nIt's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's\n. . . I don't know, stalking us.\n\nVEIDT\nUs.  You mean the Watchmen.\n\nThe big CAT purrs; it's a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red\nfur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a\nchunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders\nDREIBERG's words.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nDaniel, Rorschach is insane.\n\nDREIBERG\nI know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells\nblood.\n\nVEIDT\nYou know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs\n-- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.\n\nDREIBERG\nHe's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at\nthis late date.\n\nVEIDT\nIf he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected\nyou.  Haven't I?\n(slight pause)\nDo you need money?\n\nDREIBERG\nNo.  I just wanted you to --\n\nVEIDT\nYou did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good\nnight.\n\nDREIBERG\nGood night.\n\nVEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a\ncigarette.  It's \"matchless\"; you ignite it guy striking the tip of\nthe cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a\nlong, slow drag.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\nBarbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the\ncheckpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE\nrolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign\nwhich reads \"ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER.\"\n\n54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\nADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED\nESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door\nwith a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a\nsix-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .\n\n. . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple\ndoorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and\nwait -- to VEIDT's great amusement.\n\nThe inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned\nwoman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK\nSPECTRE.\n\nLAURIE\nAdrian.\n\nVEIDT\nLaurie!  Good to see you.\n\nShe gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall\nin perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.\n\nLAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized\nmachines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific\nparaphernalia of every description.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nNice.  Who's your decorator -- Edward Teller?\n\nLAURIE\nDon't rub it in.  I live here.\n\nVEIDT\nAnd how's life with the walking H-bomb?\n\nLAURIE\nHe's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.\n\nShe takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT\nwanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A\nSMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:\n\nVEIDT\nHi, Jon.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)\n(a deep, booming voice)\nHello, Adrian.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under\nany circumstances, but at the moment he's downright gargantuan.\nForty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he's calmly adjusting a\ncalibration atop his particle accelerator.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\nI think I'm about to detect a gluino.\n\nIn case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just\nabout anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the\nphysical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of\ntime and space, DR. MANHATTAN is a chronic offender.\n\nAny government would be glad to have him.\n\nVEIDT\nSupersymmetrical theory, hmm?  Say, I understand old Schwartzmann\ncaught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .\n\nLAURIE, who's just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.\n\nLAURIE\nPlease, you guys, no shop talk.\n(to DR. MANHATTAN)\nJon, you're being rude.  Why don't you shrivel on down and join us?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable\nsix-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist\n-- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nGood to see you, Adrian.  What's the occasion?\n\nHe tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO\nSURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.\n\nVEIDT\n. . . Are we being monitored?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the\nlittle red \"ON\" lights wink out.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThe bearer of bad news.\n\nVEIDT\nWe've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.\n\nLAURIE\nBlake?  Dead?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the\nfuneral as a matter of protocol.\n\nLAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first\nshe's heard about it.\n\nVEIDT\nRorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to\nthink that someone is \"stalking\" the Watchmen.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nOh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.\n\nVEIDT\nWhat's your theory?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nLife and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern\nme.\n\nVEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is\nconsiderably less amused.\n\nLAURIE\nI could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?\n\nVEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another\npart of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as\nwe watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and\nfloats off to one side.\n\nA module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of\nthe hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in\nmidair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn't lifted a finger; he's dismantling and\nreassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.\n\nVEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes\nthe conversation without missing a beat:\n\nVEIDT\nI guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYou mean Afghanistan?\n(beat)\nIt won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more\ninteresting.\n\nThe module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The\ncover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws\nitself shut.\n\nVEIDT\nWell . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as\nusual -- I can't tell you anything you don't already know.  Goodbye,\nJon.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds\nhis coat where LAURIE put it.  He's just about to leave when she\narrives with two stiff drinks in hand.\n\nLAURIE\nAdrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --\n\nVEIDT\nI'll take a raincheck, Laurie.\n\nLAURIE\nPlease.\n\nThere's a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his\nshoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who's forty feet tall again, playing\nwith his superaccelerator.\n\nVEIDT\nHe's a little farther gone every time.\n\nLAURIE\nStay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to\nsomeone human.\n(beat)\nHe doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I\nmean -- he even scares the research teams.\n\nVEIDT\nLaurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed\nthe world.\n\nLAURIE\n(embarrassed)\nI know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's\ndoing his work --\n\nVEIDT\nWhat about you?\n\nLAURIE\nI suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.\n(pause)\nI'll ring for the guards.\n\nShe goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her,\nconcerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest\npocket for a cigarette case:\n\nVEIDT\nNasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.\n(handing her a cigarette)\nDarling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give\nDaniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.\n\nLAURIE\nMaybe I'll do that.\n\nVEIDT\nI'm sorry about Blake.\n\nHe pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS\nappear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.\n\nLAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman\nlover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and\nWALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren't there.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT\nA decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood,\npopular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow\nstairway which dips well below street level.\n\n56. INT. HAPPY HARRY'S - NIGHT\nThe usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS\nhover at the entrance to the men's room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS\nstand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and\ngrind.  Suddenly there's a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.\n\nOver by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE\noff the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of\nvicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the\nbar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing\nglasses.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHarry.\n\nHARRY\n(petrified)\nR-Rorschach.\n\nRORSCHACH\nPhone's out of order.  Mind if I use yours?\n\nHe reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH\npicks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS\nand yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.\n\nHe turns and faces the assembled multitudes:\n\nRORSCHACH\nEdward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might've had\nhelp.\n(wandering through the room)\nThought maybe you could fill me in.\n\nENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as\nRORSCHACH strolls past.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nYou.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing?\n(moving on)\nJohnny Gobs.  What's new at the schoolyard?\n\nBehind RORSCHACH's back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively\ntoward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar,\nyanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nNicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?\n\nNICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH\nextends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --\n\n-- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He\ncloses a gloved fist around NICKY's pinky finger, twists it back and\nSNAPS IT.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nEdward Blake.  Who killed him?\n\nNo answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH\ngrabs his index finger and repeats the process.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nWho killed Edward Blake?\n\nNICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to\nthe floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He's standing poised to let\nfly at NICKY's ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.\n\nVOICE\nJESUS!  HE'S IN SHOCK!!\n\nRORSCHACH\nTHE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?\n\nBy now HARRY's pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar.\nWithout looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It\ncatches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of\nglassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the\nceiling.\n\nSILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH's next move.  He\nlooks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nSo many vermin . . . so little time.\n\nHe bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY's quivering frame, and tosses it\ncontemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long\nenough to HISS at the crowd:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nGo back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I'll be\naround.\n\n\nCUT TO:\n\n57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN\nThe bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller\nresearch complex.  It's not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and\nLAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over\nto where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is\nempty.\n\nLAURIE\n(muttering; groggy)\nJon . . . ?\n\nA LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE\ncloses her eyes and sighs.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm here, Laurie.\n\nLAURIE\nIs it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nNot yet, there's plenty of time.\n\nA SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly.\nDR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.\n\nLAURIE\nMmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?\n\nThe BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE's shoulder and arm,\ntoward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWould you like me to stay?\n\nLAURIE\nMm hmm.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI could stay and go.\n\nLAURIE\n. . . And just how would you manage that?\n\nShe leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its\ndownward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is\nmassaging LAURIE's thigh.\n\nThird blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE's eyes go suddenly\nwide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the\nfoot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.\n\nLAURIE\nAAAAAAAAAA!!\n\nDR. MANHATTAN I\nLaurie?  Are you --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN II\nDon't be upset.\n\nThis unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE's\nfragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a\ndressing gown.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, please.  I don't enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one\nperson again, please?\n\nThe big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical\ngestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN I\nLaurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN II\n-- you would find it erotic.\n\nLAURIE\nAll right, all right.  It's just -- my nerves, I'm going stir-crazy\nin this place, I --\n\nWhile fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance\nthrough a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment,\nshe sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an\nexperiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through\nthe door . . .\n\n58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER\n. . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:\n\nLAURIE\nYou've been out here all along, haven't you?  Running one of your\nstupid experiments --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN III\nYes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.\n\nLAURIE\nSo you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how\ncould you do this?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN III\nYou seem to feel I've been neglecting you.  Isn't that the case?\n(pause)\nI thought I'd solved the problem quite elegantly.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's all it is to you, isn't it?  Just another problem you\ncan --\n\nShe doesn't see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered\nthe room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:\n\nDR. MANHATTANS I & II\nLaurie, please --\n\nLAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back\nslowly, steadies herself on a lab table.\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I\ncould really use the time alone.\n\nShe storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I &\nII -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original\nDR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his\nequipment.\n\nFADE THROUGH TO:\n\n1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nA pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard\nat work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly\nbeautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it's largely\nwasted on her preoccupied date.\n\nAt the moment, she's filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:\n\nLAURIE\nThe government's really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I\nguess it's no picnic being the world's only superhuman.\n(mock-macho)\nI have to keep him in line.\n\nShe flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to\nlaugh.  He doesn't.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has\nwandered off into a far corner of the room.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nExcuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?\n\nDREIBERG\nSorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think\nanyone's out to get us -- do you?\n\nLAURIE\nDan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no\nMother Teresa.\n\nDREIBERG\nPsychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .\n\nLAURIE\nNow wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the\ngovernment or do time.\n\nDREIBERG\nFine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty\ntricks -- political assassinations --\n\nNow he's got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then\nleans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:\n\nLAURIE\nOkay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us\nmade other choices.\n\nDREIBERG\n(shaking his head in disgust)\n\nYeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors\n. . . and I'm still in the psycho file with Rorschach.\n\nLAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nWhat's so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?\n\nLAURIE\nI'm just wondering what you would've said ten years ago if you could\nsee yourself right now.\n(raising her glass)\nWell, here's to the Comedian.  'Cause the fact is, he's dead . . .\nand we're not.\n\nDREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.\n\n1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace,\nwhich overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They're holding big snifters\nof brandy, and they're both pretty well drunk.\n\nDREIBERG\nThe pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I\nmean, we were heroes!\n\nLAURIE\nDamn straight.\n\nDREIBERG\nDamn straight!  We were heroes.\n\nLAURIE\nOf course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.\n\nDREIBERG\nWell, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the\nworld and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .\n\nLAURIE\n(smiling)\nHey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma?\nWhat was his name . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nOh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd\nbeat him up?\n\nLAURIE\nThat's the one.  Whatever happened to him?\n\nDREIBERG\n(deadpan)\nHe pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an\nelevator shaft.\n\nLAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to\nher mouth -- and like DREIBERG she's GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA\nPULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a\nstentorian VOICE over scene:\n\nCHAPLAIN (V.O.)\nIn the midst of life we are in death . . .\n\nCUT TO:\n\n59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY\nAN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.\n\nCHAPLAIN\n. . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall\nchange our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --\n\nTIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of\nmourners.  There's no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the\nattendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons\nof protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off\nwith the traditional twenty-one gun salute.\n\nCHAPLAIN (cont.)\n-- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all\nthings unto himself.\n\nA light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR.\nMANHATTAN, of course, doesn't need one -- the raindrops vanish\nmiraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the\ndistance, and he glances off at:\n\n60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT\nSENTRIES stand at attention.  They've blocked off the part of the\ncemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has\nbeen spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like\nwildfire.\n\nMOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the\ncemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due\nrespect for the dead, Arlington National's turning into a zoo:\ngawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their\nhands full managing the crowd.\n\nA KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to\njoin the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the\nVIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.\n\nIt's not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled\nmarble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward,\nand he's cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms,\nPieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze\nplaque bears the inscription:\n\nIN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS\nWHO GAVE THEIR LIVES\nTO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM\n\nBelow it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four\nhundred of them.\n\n61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\nThe Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE's home sweet\nhome.  Her car pulls up to the guard's booth and he waves her\nthrough.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind\nher, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.\n\n62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT\nLAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex,\nfumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the\ncard into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.\n\nShe tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls\nup behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps\nout.\n\nLAURIE\nMajor Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.\n\nADAMSON\nLaurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.\n\nLAURIE\nWhy?  What's the problem?\n\nADAMSON\nI can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.\n\nLAURIE\n(chuckling)\nI would like to use the bathroom --\n\nAs she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.\n\nADAMSON\nThe access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat?!\n\nADAMSON\nPlease.\n\nThe major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The\nGUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.\n\nADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE's climbing inside when she\nsees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.\n\nThe entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging\nfrom it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION\nSUITS.\n\n63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT\nLAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to\na team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard\nat the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white\ngown:\n\nNURSE\nMiss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat -- ?\n\nDOCTOR\nDrink this.\n\nThe DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She\nstares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.\n\nDOCTOR\nDrink it.\n\n64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT\nTECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are\nshifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of\na human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens\non:\n\n65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT\nWe're watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A\ndonut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot,\nfoot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to\nthe anteroom.\n\nThrough a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head\nwedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right\nas she wonders just what the hell is going on.\n\n66. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nA MAN'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.\n\nLAURIE (O.S.)\nThat's Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon's military liaison.\n\nLAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table\nsurrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent\nSCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken\nfrom a thick sheaf.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nDr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon's research teams.  The\nquantum-whatever.\n\nSCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It's a group shot of the\nWatchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE's closet.  LAURIE\nhesitates.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nThat's Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt.\n(long pause)\nRorschach . . .\n\nSCHMIDT\nTheir real names, please.\n\nLAURIE\nI don't know their real names.\n\nSCHMIDT\nYou're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.\n\nLAURIE\nI don't know their real names!\n\nSCHMIDT\nYou're not \"protecting\" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on\nthe answers you give.\n(holding up the sheaf of photos)\nThese are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --\n\nLAURIE\nThen why don't you ask him?!?\n\nFurious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby\nwindow.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced\ntorturers, they understand the value of patience.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nI want to get dressed.  -- And I'd like a cigarette.\n\nOne of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out\nfor LAURIE.  As he's lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door\nopens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.\n\nHe passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and\ntilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with\ncuriosity:\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nSomeone had better tell me what's going on here!\n\nSCHMIDT\nSit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file\nare all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else\nin common as well.\n(beat)\nThey've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?\n\nAll at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE's face goes\nbone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she\ntakes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she's read.\n\nSCHMIDT\nI'm terribly sorry.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat does this mean?  What does it --\n\nSCHMIDT\nSix to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can\nsee why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible\njoke to make me --\n\nShe scans the room.  No one's laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to\nhis comrades, and heads for the door.\n\nSCHMIDT\nTake a day or two.  If you \"remember\" any names . . . do give us a\ncall.\n\nThe AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches\nfor the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking,\nshe buries her face in her hands.\n\n67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nA darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a\ntwo-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who's been\nwatching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.\n\nADAMSON\nPoor kid.\n\nSCHMIDT\nWe'll keep her in isolation awhile.  She'll give us some names.\n\nADAMSON\nTo hell with those costumed idiots.  I'm worried about Doc\nManhattan.\n\nSCHMIDT\nWhat do you mean?\n\nADAMSON\nShe's his last link to humanity.  Once she's gone . . . God knows\nwhich way he'll jump.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY\nDR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He's wearing\na navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie\nwith an irregular mauve pattern.\n\nThe tie doesn't quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie\nmagically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal\ngold stripes.\n\nToo staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into\na handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for\ndecoration.\n\nIt does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the\nmirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.\n\n69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY\nTECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green\nroom, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.\n\nDIRECTOR\nWe're on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is\nthat big blue son of a --\n\nHe stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just\nrematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR's\nface.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm sorry.  Am I late?\n\nDIRECTOR\nNo problem.  We'll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I'm\nKent Turner, the director. . .\n\nThe DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN's hand and marches him down a\nhallway.  Within seconds they're joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.\n\nLIAISON\nDr. Osterman.  I've got a list of taboo areas here we'd like you to\nsteer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you'll\njust play it cool --\n\nDIRECTOR\nDoc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give\nus something a little darker . . . ?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWill this do?\n\nDIRECTOR\nPerfect.\n\nLIAISON\nNow Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --\n\nBut the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by\na cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are\nhurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON\nhangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The \"ABC NEWS\nSPECIAL REPORT\" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC\nunderneath.\n\n70. INSERT - TV MONITOR\nStock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for\ntheir lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right\nand takes in an extraordinary sight.\n\nA towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through\nthe jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the\ngreenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts\nof automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation\ncrew does his apocalypse thing.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads:\n\"VIETNAM.  1965.\"\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O.)\nDr. Manhattan: the nuclear titan spawned in a freak scientific\nmishap.  For more than twenty years the \"Manhattan Option\" has been\nthe linchpin of America's conventional strategy --\n\nWe CUT to PRAGUE, where RUSSIAN TANKS are rolling through a broad\nthoroughfare.  DR. MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds\na corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.\n\nHis EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey\ngunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM\nhisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met\nwith a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads:\n\"CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968.\"\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)\n-- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a\none-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding\nthe Communist menace in check.\n\nDANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from\nAmerican Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake\nhands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a\nthree-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic\naccord.  Title: \"NICARAGUA.  1979.\"\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)\nIn the famous words of General William Westmoreland, \"Yes, Virginia,\nthere is a Superman -- and thank God, he's American.\"\n\n71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nA sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop\nof the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded\nnews vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host's chair:\n\nBRINKLEY\nFor this live question-and-answer session we'll be joined by\ncorrespondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating,\nI'll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy.\n(turning)\nNow let's welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better\nknown to the world as Dr. Manhattan.\n\nApplause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at\nBRINKLEY's right.  He nods in acknowledgement.\n\nBRINKLEY (cont.)\nI suppose the topic on everyone's mind this week is Afghanistan,\nwhere Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now\nsince you've dealt successfully with similar situations in the past .\n. . I'll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that\nyou intervene?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI will not intervene in Afghanistan.\n\nA HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.\n\n72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\nLooking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.\n\n73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN\nHANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience.\nBRINKLEY ignores them:\n\nBRINKLEY\nYou're saying you would refuse a direct request?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThere will be no request.  I will not intervene.\n\nBRINKLEY\nWell, Doctor, it's widely understood, or rumored, that you can\nactually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the\nhostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?\n\n74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\nHe's steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he's hanging on\nDR. MANHATTAN's every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE\nin the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:\n\nLIAISON\nI want a phone line to the booth.  Now.\n\n75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it.\n(long pause)\nI can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will\nnot intervene.\n\nHe sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.\n\nBRINKLEY\nWell, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I'll\nopen up the floor to questions now.  Doug?\n\nREPORTER\nDr. Osterman, I'm Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I'd like to read\nyou some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M.\nWeaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nAll friends, yes.  Associates of mine.\n\nROTH\nLet me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White.\nAre you aware that these \"friends\" and \"associates\" of yours have all\nbeen diagnosed with terminal cancer?\n\nThe CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY's taken aback.  He\ngapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face\nan unreadable mask.\n\n76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\neyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone\n\nLIAISON\nOh Jesus.\n(barking into phone)\nI want this broadcast killed.  I'll run out on that goddamn set if I\nhave to!\n\n77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN\nROTH\nI have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly\ndiagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a\nconnection?\n\nBy now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make\nhimself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who's just gotten a message\nfrom the booth, touches his headset and announces:\n\nBRINKLEY\nI'm told it's time for a break.  We'll be back after this brief\nmessage --\n\nWithin seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set,\nflanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.\n\nLIAISON\nTHAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW'S OVER!!\n\nThe three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then,\nPANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB\nTHE SET.\n\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\nDr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause\ncancer??\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI don't wish to answer any questions.\n\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\nYou see the future!  Did you know in advance --\n\nLIAISON\nThe Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP\nASIDE!!\n\nThe LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but\nthe mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.\n\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\nHow long have you known -- why is the government concealing this\ninformation --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nPlease get out of my way.\n\nThe LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor.\nSCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it's getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN\nlets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI said LEAVE ME ALONE!!\n\nIn the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no\nmicrophones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR.\nMANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.\n\nBRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later,\nthere's an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES,\nleaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT\nThe place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is\noverseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post\nquarantine notices at the entrances.  He's not altogether surprised\nwhen DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWhere's Laurie?\n\nADAMSON backs off slightly.  He's not wearing a radiation suit, and\nhe's understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely\nnecessary.\n\nADAMSON\nShe's been relocated, Jon.  It's strictly precautionary . . .\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThere's no need to lie.  I assume she's been tested.  Were the\nresults positive?\n\nADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\nDon't bother.  I already know what you'll say.\n\nHe watches impassively as what's left of his home is dismantled.  His\nmind is already a million miles away.\n\nADAMSON\nJon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . .\ncould you cure her?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI don't know.  I only know that I won't.\n(long pause)\nThere'd be no point.  It's finally begun.\n\nADAMSON\n\"Begun?\"  What's begun?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI've seen this day.  It's the day I've been dreading all these years.\n(pause)\nYou see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I\ncared for . . .\n\nADAMSON doesn't know what he's talking about, but a chill runs down\nhis spine nonetheless.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nMy work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.\n\nAnd with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves\nbehind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at\nthe Major's feet.\n\nADAMSON\nGood Lord --\n\nCUT TO:\n\n79. EXT. OUTER SPACE\n-- and it's about as exterior as you can get.  We're a few\nhundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily\napparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily\nbeautiful\n-- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white\nclouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing\nour planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.\n\nIt's DR. MANHATTAN.  He's in a lotus position, sitting on\nnothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage.\nStars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he's about to\nleave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.\n\n80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT\nBlack sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so\nbarren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is,\nuntil we see the residue of man's presence on the landscape: ruined\nquonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements,\nhalf-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than\nhusks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a\nrotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.\n\nA gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden\nRUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue\nlight.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift\nin the sky and descends gently to earth.\n\nThe rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once\nmore as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town\nof Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was\nonce a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long\nmahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.\n\nA desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We\nMOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY\nIt's twenty-odd years ago, and we're looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN\n-- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie\nand a white lab coat.  He's at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing\na dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:\n\nJANEY SLATER (O.S.)\nNineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You'd think they\ncould at least make us a decent hamburger.\n\nJON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He's utterly smitten\nwith DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she's a couple\nof years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just\nclose enough to LAURIE that you'd notice the resemblance.  And she's\nprobably the only one in the room who can't see just how bad a crush\nJON has on her.\n\nJON\nI'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna\nhead straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.\n\nJANEY\nWith lots of ketchup?\n\nSmiling, she indicates JON's plate.  He's emptied at least half a\nbottle on his french fries.\n\nJON\nNothing wrong with ketchup.\n\nJANEY\nJon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug\nlike you doing in a place like this?\n\nJON\nAnything for science, I guess.\n(long, hesitant pause)\nJaney, there's something --\n\nJANEY\n(simultaneously)\nWe should get back --\n(realizing she's cut him off)\nWhat?\n\nJON\nNothing.  What were you going to say?\n\nJANEY\nWe should get back to the lab.\n(staring at him; chuckling)\nYou okay, Jon?\n\nHe stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he\npipes up:\n\nJON\nOh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I'll be right behind you.\n\nThe lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads\nfor the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after\nJANEY.  She's paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.\n\nHis face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up\nbehind her.\n\nJANEY\nStupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --\n\nJON\n(blurting it out)\nJaney, will you marry me?\n\nShe turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He's wearing the\npained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the\nverdict.\n\nJANEY\nJon -- what?\n\nJON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes\nlocked.  For a moment it's as if they're the only souls in the\ncanteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the\ndoor, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and\none of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled\nJANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.\n\nThere's a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private\ntrance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.\n\nWALLY\nChrist, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.\n\nJANEY\nOh Wally, don't feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --\n\nJON\nI can fix it.\n\nJANEY\n-- What?\n\nJON\nMy dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better\nthan ever.\n\nHe holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.\n\nWALLY\nTake him up on it.  It'd make me feel better.\n\nChuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY\nhands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her\nwith basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he's still waiting for his\nanswer.\n\nBut before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket.\nHe thrusts it abruptly into JANEY's hands --\n\nJON\nHere.  I'll trade you.\n\n-- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING.\nWith a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but\nhe's already gone.\n\nShe stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.\n\n82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY\nJON's at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center\nof the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER'S\nTOOLS.\n\nIt's his lunch hour, and he's fixing JANEY's watch.  He tightens the\ncentral screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal\ninto its housing and gives it a light tap.\n\nWith a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy's in love,\nremember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed\nwith oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST\nCHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of\nit are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like\nanti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.\n\nHe stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and\nwalks over to grab it.  As he's putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK\nfrom the direction of the test chamber.\n\nMounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes,\nseconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it's 13:58 and change.  JON\neyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to\nthe reinforced steel door of the chamber.\n\nInside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a\nlow platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it\nhears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY's watch on the\nconcrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.\n\nJON\nC'mon, little guy, outta here . . .\n\nThe mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in\nhand.\n\nJON (cont.)\n. . . don't wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.\n\nHe stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he's left the watch\ninside.\n\nHe looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting.\nAgitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the\ndoorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of\nthe concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete\nblock, reaches for the watch --\n\n-- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.\n\nWhite-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete\nblock -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of\nthe support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.\n\nBefore his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place --\nTRAPPING HIM INSIDE.\n\nHe LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps\nsliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams\nshut.\n\n83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT\n1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One\nof them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of\nMILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the\nfacilities.\n\nSCIENTIST\n-- actually, we don't know what happens when you disrupt the\nintrinsic field.  All we've managed to do so far is blow a few\nconcrete blocks all to hell.\n\nGENERAL\n(joking, but worried)\nNo danger of . . . fallout, is there?\n\nSCIENTIST\nNo sir.  The chamber's radiation-proof once it's sealed.  That's why\nwe waited outside.\n\nThe translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a\ndull red.\n\nThe crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There's a dim, distant\nTHUMPING.\n\nThe SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect\nunison.\n\nGENERAL\nWhat's the matter?\n\nSCIENTIST\nSweet Jesus -- !\n\nWe DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of\nthe test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the\nterrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass,\nscreaming soundlessly.\n\nPandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left,\npunching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes\nto a belated and painfully obvious realization:\n\nGENERAL\nSay, there's a man in there!!\n\nThe coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One\nSCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --\n\nSCIENTIST I\nStay calm, Jon!  We'll try and kill the power!\n\n-- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:\n\nSCIENTIST II\nBuilding six!  Kill the power!  Osterman's trapped in the I.F.\nchamber!!\n\nThe GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.\n\nGENERAL\nWell -- why doesn't someone let him out??\n\nSCIENTIST III\nIt's a timelock.  It can't be opened once the sequence\nstarts.\n(to SCIENTIST II)\nWhat's the word?\n\nSCIENTIST II\n(covering the phone)\nThey're sending a crew to the generator building --\n\nSCIENTIST IV\nTWENTY SECONDS!\n\nIn a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions \"IN\nCASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS.\"  WALLY WEAVER, Jon's friend from the\ncanteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the\nglass, and grabs the ax.\n\nSCIENTIST I\nWally!  What are you doing?\n\nWALLY\nThe power cables!!\n\nAnd now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY\nSLATER.\n\nJANEY\nAm I late for the --\n\nShe stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the\nlab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back\nthrough the door.\n\nSCIENTIST III\nJaney!  Get her out of here.  Get out!\n\nBut she resists.  She's just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to\ntake a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils\nhave just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.\n\nJANEY\nWhat in the name of -- where's Jon?\n\nSCIENTIST III\nJaney!  Please!  Go!!\n\nWALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a\nsudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a\nwall.\n\nSparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white\nlight.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look\nat the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.\n\nJANEY\nJon.\n\n84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\nJON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his\nface.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch,\nwhich he's been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters .\n. .\n\n. . . and everything in the room goes blue.\n\n85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT\nThe SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to\ntear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind\nthem.\n\nJANEY\nJon . . .\n(shrieking)\nJON!!!\n\n86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\nJON's back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of\nunbelievable agony.\n\nA moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a\nphotographic negative -- stands in his place.\n\nThen the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The\niridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to\npieces.\n\nAnd then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim,\nand we're looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of\nthe SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY,\nwho gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT\nThe desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall\nbehind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago\nat 11:48 PM.\n\nFor a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches\nthe rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the\ndoor of the canteen.\n\n88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.\n\n89. INT. MEN'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\nTWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into\nthe mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous\nthing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal\ncord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous\nsystem.\n\nThey pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in\na haze of shimmering blue light.\n\n90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.\n\n91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\nHORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A\npartially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS\nfor several seconds before vanishing altogether.\n\n92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.\n\n93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\nDinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.\n\nJANEY\nI can't help it.  I'm going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it\nfeels haunted.\n\nWALLY\nIt'll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that's all.\n(tugging at his ear)\nDo you hear some kind of -- whistling?\n\nIndeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine.\nOdder yet, WALLY's hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY's.\nEveryone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish\nphenomenon.\n\nUTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without\nwarning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW\nsuffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .\n\n. . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them,\nnude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and\nutensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.\n\nJANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go\nto her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.\n\nJANEY\nJON-N-N-N!!!\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nTHE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns,\nstares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and\nbegins to dig.\n\nA couple of inches down, he finds what he's looking for: an ancient,\ntattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and\nJaney Slater.  She's holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new\nengagement ring.\n\nHis fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.\n\n95. SERIES OF SHOTS\nQuick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:\n\n-- JON's black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;\n\n-- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue\nlight;\n\n-- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper.\nThere's a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a\nterrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .\n\n-- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom\ncloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.\n\n96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN\nFists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in\nthe ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at\nfirst, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue\nstarburst a mile above the ground.\n\n97. EXT. OUTER SPACE\nAll at once, we're back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth\nat unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on\ntoward Mars.\n\nThe red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame\nas we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface.\nIndividual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct:\nvast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri.\nHerschel's famous canali.  And finally, the argyre\nplanitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling\ntwo jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular\nridge.\n\nTwo eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a\nhappy-face.\n\nMany miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian\natmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we\n\nCUT TO:\n\n98. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN\nThe late news, with highlights of DR. MANHATTAN's press conference.\nAs the throng of REPORTERS shove microphones at him, we ZOOM IN on\nhis angered face:\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI said leave me alone!!\n\nThen there's a sudden CUT.  We see the same REPORTERS, in the same\npositions, only DR. MANHATTAN is gone -- and they're all standing on\nthe White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.\n\nPULL BACK TO:\n\n99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT\nA restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair.\nShe's in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the\nbig metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy\nfurnished studio.\n\nTV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)\n-- in Washington, where an irate Dr. Manhattan teleported\na crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania\nAvenue!\n\nTV ANCHORMAN (O.S.)\nWell, Katie, I know some politicians who'd like to learn that trick --\n\nLAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.  A moment later,\nSCHMIDT enters, followed by a pair of FEDERAL AGENTS.\n\nSCHMIDT\nAll right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.\n\nLAURIE\nAm I free to go?\n\nSCHMIDT\nYou're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move\nit.\n\nLAURIE\n(fed up; exploding)\nI don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit\n--\n\nSCHMIDT\nOh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan\nborder this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living\nsoul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic\nweapons has finally flipped out.\n\nLAURIE\nJon??  You mean he's --\n\nSCHMIDT\nThat's right.

A\nDRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight\nWOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and\noff as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging\ntipsy giggles.\n\n102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT\nA three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.  A door opens, and the MAN\nushers his date inside with exaggerated formality.  Her name is LUCY;\nhis is Edgar William Jacobi, but -- for reasons soon to be revealed --\nwe'll call him MOLOCH.\n\nMOLOCH\nNow.  What was milady drinking?\n\nLUCY\nGin.  Straight up --\n(mock-ladylike)\n\n-- with a little twist of lime.\n\nShe laughs convulsively, as if she's just told the world's funniest\njoke.  MOLOCH lifts a single finger and starts toward the kitchen:\n\nMOLOCH\nI think I can oblige.\n\n103. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nMOLOCH FREEZES in the doorway, his face taut with apprehension.  The\ncontents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen\nfloor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It's a\ndisaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in\nthe doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.\n\nLUCY\nJeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?\n\nOn cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH.\nHe grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen\ntable.\n\nRORSCHACH\nMoloch.  Did you miss me?\n\nLUCY\nWillie!  Jesus!  What's going on?\n\nRORSCHACH\n(glancing up)\nWho's the welfare mother?\n\nMOLOCH\nI don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong\nguy.\n\nRORSCHACH\nEdgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.\n\nMOLOCH\nYou're making a big --\n\nRORSCHACH lifts MOLOCH up slightly, then slams him down hard against\nthe table -- repeatedly, to the beat.\n\nRORSCHACH\nTerrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.\n\nMOLOCH\nALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?\n\nLUCY\nWillie, what's he talking about?\n\nRORSCHACH backs off, allowing MOLOCH to slump to the floor.\nRORSCHACH kneels beside him.\n\nMOLOCH\nLook, I don't know what you want, but I been a private citizen for\nten years.  I --\n\nRORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH's chin and pulls him\nclose.  Then, for LUCY's benefit, he explains:\n\nRORSCHACH\nTurned state's witness in '75.  Earned himself a brand-new face.\n(twisting MOLOCH's head to one side, for a better look)\nHnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.\n\nHe shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There's a sugar\nbowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as\nMOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nComedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who's\nbehind it?\n\nMOLOCH\nRorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with\n--\n\nRORSCHACH\nWorked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.\n\nMOLOCH\nCTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --\n\nRORSCHACH\nDon't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.\n\nLUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH's side and grips his arm as\nRORSCHACH opens a rear window.  He's climbing through the frame when\nhe stops suddenly and points a finger at the frightened pair:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nWord of advice for the lady . . . stock up on penicillin.\n\n-- and he's out on the fire escape and GONE.  LUCY looks suspiciously\nat MOLOCH, who shrugs, embarrassed: I don't know what he's talking\nabout.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n104. INT. PENTAGON - WAR ROOM - DAY\nThe familiar set from Dr. Strangelove: top brass seated at a\nbig round table, with a huge Mercator-projection map of the world\nlooming in BG.  The Afghan-Pakistani border is highlighted in red; a\nMILITARY ANALYST paces in front of the big board with a penlight\nPOINTER,\nhighlighting areas of strategic importance.\n\nANALYST\nOur projections show Pakistan falling within the week.  From there\nit's sixty percent certain they'll try to take Western Europe.\n\nGENERAL\nRespectfully, sir, out NATO allies are getting itchy.

Of course.\n\nBy now, both coasts are pretty well blotted out.  The ANALYST, a\ndedicated optimist, turns to announce:\n\nANALYST\nAs you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the\nfarm belt.\n\nPRESIDENT\nWhat about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . \"nuclear winter\"\ntheory?\n\nANALYST\nWe don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . .\nmay depend on a quirk of the weather.\n\nPRESIDENT\nThe weather.

I appreciate your honesty.\n\n106. INT. GUNGA DINER - DUSK\nA greasy Indian restaurant in a Village storefront.  In a booth near\nthe entrance we find LAURIE and DREIBERG munching on chicken\ntandoori.\n\nDREIBERG\nChrist yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a\ncouple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .\n(pause)\nHow about you, Laurie?\n\nLAURIE\n(lying -- with forced cheer)\nOh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the\nhell out.\n(shrugging)\nNo expense account.  No place to live.\n\nDREIBERG\nYou'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each\nother, someone might put two and two together . . .\n\nLAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.\n\nLAURIE\nThey're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're\nright on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the\nWatchmen.\n\nDREIBERG\nMaybe not, but why take chances?\n\nLAURIE\nDan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent\nall these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel --\nI feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own\nlife, and --\n\n-- and she's dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a\ndamper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts\nto get up.\n\nLAURIE\nI'm just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I'd better go find\nmyself a cheap room.\n\nDREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the\ndoor of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and\nchases her down:\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . .\n.\nLAURIE\nOh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --\n\nDREIBERG\nNo, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely\nright.  -- I'd love to have you stay.\n\nLAURIE\nYou're sure?\n\nHe nods.  She smiles and takes his arm as they walk out of the\nrestaurant.\n\nTHROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the\nstreet outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of\nframe, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of\nketchup.\n\nHe inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down\nquestion mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he\nopens it again, he's got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.\n\n107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET\nA SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant,\nthen disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls\ncasually down the alleyway.\n\nHe moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the\ncrumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a\nsmall recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a\nshifting INKBLOT MASK.\n\n108. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nThe guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style:\nflowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc.\nIt's small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative \"aah\" as\nDREIBERG ushers her in.\n\nLAURIE\nThis is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.\n\nDREIBERG's lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands\nthere for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nAre you . . . waiting for a tip?\n\nDREIBERG\nOh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I\nmean, if you need some aspirin, or --\n\nLAURIE\nI'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really\nsweet.  Sleep tight, okay?\n\nShe gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek, then returns to her\nunpacking.  DREIBERG watches her for a second, then turns to go.\n\n109. INT. HALLWAY - ON DREIBERG\nAs he closes the door, he get a quick glimpse, from behind, of LAURIE\nunbuttoning her shirt.  He quickly averts his gaze and pulls the door\nshut.\n\n110. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\nDREIBERG, in pajamas, climbs into bed and kills the light.  He folds\nhis hands behind his head and stares up at the ceiling.\n\n111. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE\nAnother quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it's SILK SPECTRE --\nLAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off\nvaliantly, but she's heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.\n\nAn oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into\nframe; he's clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP\noverhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE's path and\nsnatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.\n\n112. INT. BEDROOM - ON DREIBERG.\nHis head turns at the sound of WATER running in the bathroom\nadjacent.  He's going to be awake half the night thinking of\nLAURIE.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n113. EXT. STREET - DAY\nEarly morning.  Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in\nan alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and\ncrewcut.  He's got a definite CTU look about him.\n\nMOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA\nDINER.\n\n114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nA twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and\npulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the\nnose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges\nof his EYELIDS.\n\nHis eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper;\nbizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it\nup . . .\n\nThere's a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.\n\nA low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and\nsees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.\n\nHe GASPS and lunges for the door.  RORSCHACH's arm snakes out and\nholds the stall door shut.\n\nRORSCHACH\nTwo things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational\ndrugs.\n\nMOLOCH\nNo, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got\nsomething for you.\n\nA long pause.  RORSCHACH GROWLS again: let's have it.\n\nMOLOCH (cont.)\nThere's a big bunch of research scientists -- missing.  Blake was on\na case, trying to track 'em down.\n(beat)\nIt's big, Rorschach.  Something to do with Doc Manhattan.  That's all\nI've been able to find out.\n\nRORSCHACH\nDrug habit.  Highly illegal.  Hnrrh.\n(snarling)\nLet it go time.  In future -- just say no.\n\nWith that he disappears over the edge of the stall.  MOLOCH sits\nthere a moment.  He reaches for the stall door, rattles it.  It won't\nopen.\n\nMOLOCH\nHEY!!\n\nRORSCHACH's stuck a broomstick through the door handles on the\nadjacent stalls. As MOLOCH POUNDS on the door in frustration, we\n\nCUT TO:\n\n115. INT. VEIDT'S PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY\nA plush RECEPTION ROOM in his Veidt Industries pyramid; it's\ndecorated in the same Egyptian motifs as his office.  VEIDT sits in\nan overstuffed chair, surrounded by VIDEO CAMERAS; he's in the\nprocess of charming JUSTINE JAMES, a fawning Barbara Walters-figure\nwho's prepping a segment for her next celebrity-chat special.\n\nJUSTINE\nNow Adrian, I guess there's one thing everyone wants to know.\nAre you the world's smartest man?\n\nVEIDT\nOh my, yes.  And the best-dressed.\n\nA round of chuckles from the video CREW.  Wotta smoothie!\n\nJUSTINE\nYou're certainly one of the richest.  Holder of over forty\nbasic patents -- including products that have changed our everyday\nlives.\n(pause)\nIf you had one achievement you were proudest of -- what would that be?\n\nVEIDT ponders for a second, then reaches into his jacket and pulls\nout his gold cigarette case.\n\nVEIDT\nSphinx brand.\n(opening the case)\nWhen I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . .\nhumanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good\nin the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco,\nthat no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs\nas you smoke it?\n(lighting up)\nIn fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?\n\nJUSTINE\nThanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your\nold colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --\n\nVEIDT\n(bristling)\nNo.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the\nWatchmen.\n\nJUSTINE\nOh sweetheart, just a quick one.\n\nVEIDT\nNo.  We laid out very careful ground rules --\n\nVEIDT is interrupted by a GROWLING NOISE from his office adjacent.\nHe glances quickly over his shoulder, then gets back to business.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\n-- we agreed specifically --\n\nMORE GROWLING from the next room over.  The CAMERA CREW's getting\ncurious.  VEIDT gets up from his chair.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nExcuse me a second.\n\nHe goes to the office door and slips inside.  The usually-smiley\nJUSTINE shoots a look of disgust at her CREW: what a prick.\n\n116. INT. VEIDT'S OFFICE - DAY\nVEIDT is shocked to find RORSCHACH down on the carpet, wrestling with\nhis mutant LYNX.  He CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE:\n\nVEIDT\nKITTY!!\n\nOne last nip, and the cat backs off.  RORSCHACH gets to his feet --\nno visible signs of damage, except for a severe bruise to his\ndignity.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nHow the hell did you get in here?\n\nThe curtains are flapping; a BREEZE hits VEIDT across the face.  He\nlooks up, sees a NEAT ROUND HOLE cut out of his plate-glass\nwindow.\n\nRORSCHACH\nNew information.\n\nVEIDT\n(pointing to the telephone)\nEver see one of these before?\n\nRORSCHACH\nToo important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked\nup.\n\nVEIDT\nWhat is that ungodly smell?\n\nRORSCHACH, abashed, lets out a timid version of his trademark\nHISS.\n\nRORSCHACH\nBigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .\n\nVEIDT\nYeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a\nroomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.\n(beat)\nAnd whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us\nall look bad.\n\nRORSCHACH\nFate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad\npress.\n\nHe makes for the window.  VEIDT frowns, adjusts his tie and exits.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n117. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE cooking dinner.  DREIBERG burns his fingers on a\nbroiling pan, which prompts a sudden round of stamping and\ncursing.\n\nLAURIE watches for a minute, then shakes her head.  She pours a full\nglass of wine and thrusts it at him.\n\nLAURIE\nDaniel -- drink this.  Immediately.\n(smiling)\nI swear, you are acting like a kid on a date.\n\nSucking on his burnt fingers, he reluctantly takes the wineglass.\n\nDREIBERG\nOkay, I'm nervous.  It's an odd sensation.  I've always had to think\nof you as Dr. Manhattan's --\n\nHe catches himself -- too late.  LAURIE glowers at him.\n\nLAURIE\nHis what?\n\nDREIBERG\nHis . . . whatever.\n\nLAURIE\nI'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?\n\nShe spears a couple of steaks, drops them on plates, and heads toward\nthe dining room.\n\nLAURIE\nLook, I just want to eat dinner and get drunk.  Let's not make it any\nmore difficult than we have to, huh?\n\n118.

DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nA DINING ROOM TABLE littered with crumpled napkins and dirty\ndishes.  DREIBERG and LAURIE have just finished dinner.  He stares in\ndismay at the TV screen as he opens a fresh bottle of wine.\n\nDREIBERG\nGood Lord.  With Jon out of the picture it's a whole new ball\ngame.\n\nLAURIE's already a little tipsy, and the broadcast doesn't much\ninterest her.  Wine glass in hand, she's wandered over to the stereo\ncabinet.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's right, Daniel.  A whole new ball game.\n(smiling)\nGod!  I haven't seen on of these in fifteen years.\n\nShe's referring to DREIBERG's ancient TURNTABLE.  Shelved beneath it\nare row upon row of LP's -- these days, they're obsolete collector's\nitems.\n\nDREIBERG\nI told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I\nlisten to -- it never came out on crystal.\n\nLAURIE\nI'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.\n(flipping through records)\nNellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these\npeople.\n\nDREIBERG\nPlay one.  Educate yourself.\n\nLAURIE chuckles.  Her head turns at the sound of a familiar\nCOMMERCIAL THEME.  On the TV, a young woman sits at her vanity and\ngazes lovingly at a WEDDING PICTURE framed in silver.\n\nLAURIE\nOh look.  It's Adrian's ad.\n\nTV CHORUS\n\"Oh my darling, it's incredible,\nThat someone so unforgettable . . .\"\n\n120. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT\nMOLOCH's apartment.  THE SAME COMMERCIAL is blaring from the TV as\nRORSCHACH lets himself in.\n\nTV CHORUS\n\". . . Should think I am unforgettable too.\"\n\nRORSCHACH\nMoloch?\n\nNo reply from MOLOCH, who sits in an easy chair, his back to camera,\nseemingly glued to the tube.  RORSCHACH casts a cautious glance\naround the room and advances stealthily toward the chair.  Onscreen,\nthe WOMAN at the vanity opens a jar and smear LIME-GREEN GOO on her\nface:\n\nTV ANNOUNCER\nThe years melt away with NOSTALGIA.  Use it once a week -- and\nwrinkles vanish overnight.  Medically tested, non-habit-forming\nNOSTALGIA is the patented beauty cream that actually reverses\nthe aging process . . .\n\nRORSCHACH\nMoloch?\n\nHe creeps up behind MOLOCH, lays a hand on his shoulder.\n\n121. REVERSE ANGLE - ON MOLOCH\nstaring at the TV screen with sightless eyes.  There's a NEAT ROUND\nBULLET-HOLE in the center of his forehead.  RORSCHACH sees it and\nspins on his heels, anticipating an ambush --\n\nTV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)\nFor the smooth young face he'll never forget --\n\n122. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nLAURIE is still flipping through records.  DREIBERG chuckles at the\nTV ad.\n\nTV ANNOUNCER\n-- turn back the clock with NOSTALGIA . . . from Veidt Industries.\n\nDREIBERG\nNo wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?\n\nLAURIE\nSure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm\nthirty-eight years old!\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide\nit?\n\nLAURIE\nI like the way you look.\n(beat)\nIt's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change.\nBut you, Daniel, you look . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nOld?\n\nLAURIE\nNot at all.  You look very -- dashing.\n(standing up)\nHere, you pick one.\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . What?\n\nLAURIE\nPick a record.  I feel like dancing.\n\nHer tone is unmistakably flirtatious.  DREIBERG hesitates -- then,\nwith a noncommittal smile, he moves to the record cabinet.\n\n123. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH making a hasty exit.  An AMPLIFIED VOICE booms out:\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nRORSCHACH!  THIS IS THE CIVIL TERRORISM UNIT.  YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO\nCOME OUT.\n\nHe goes to the window and peeks through the blinds.  On the street\noutside, BUBBLE CARS are massing, blocking off the intersection.  A\nCTU SWAT TEAM prepares to raid the building.\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nYOU WON'T BE HARMED.  COME OUT.  IT'S ALL OVER!\n\nHe's walked into a trap.  As he lets the blinds fall, ALL SOUND DIES\n-- and a bouncy, tinkling PIANO THEME comes up underneath.\n\n124. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nThe PIANO MUSIC emanates from DREIBERG's stereo: an old Fats Waller\ntune, \"S'posin'.\"  He's slow dancing with LAURIE, their faces\nilluminated by the cold blue flicker of the television.  With a smile\nshe reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt\npocket.\n\nDreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making\nhim nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her\nhands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so\nthat he can't avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on\nhis mouth.\n\nThe PIANO INTRO ends, and Fats' teasing vocal begins:\n\n\"S'posin' I should fall in love with you . . .\nDo you think that you could love me too . . .\"\n\n125. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)\nSONG CONTINUES UNDERNEATH, cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a\nhorrific silent movie.  RORSCHACH races out of the bathroom carrying\na plastic MOP BUCKET, plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans --\nordinary household supplies.  He enters the kitchen, rummages around\nunder the sink, finds another handful of bottles: cleaning fluid,\nrubbing alcohol, Drano.\n\nAlmost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove, turns on all the\nburners -- and BLOWS OUT THE FLAMES.\n\n\"S'posin' I should hug you and caress you . . .\nWould it impress you . . .\"\n\n126. INT. TENEMENT - FRONT STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)\nA contingent of ARMED CTU MEN rushing silently up the stairs.\n\n\"Or would it distress you?  Hmm?\"\n\n127. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT (MOS)\nRORSCHACH dousing the living room carpet with charcoal lighter and\nrubbing alcohol.  There's a pile of bottles -- only half-emptied --\nresting next to the front door.  The CTU COPS are pounding on the\nfront door, trying to break it down.  RORSCHACH crouches in the\nhallway just outside the living room.\n\nThe door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH\nstrikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN --\ncreating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the\npuddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF\nBOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.\n\n\"S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .\n(Yeah I yearn.  Sure I do.)\nWould you think I'm speaking out of turn? . . .\"\n\n128. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE horizontal on the sofa, their clothes in\ndisarray.  LAURIE kisses him hungrily -- but he's distant, panicky,\nunable to respond.  It's been a long time for him.  It's not going\nwell.\n\n\"S'posin' I declare it\nWould you take my love and share it?\nI'm not s'posin', I'm in love with you . . .\"\n\nHe wriggles beneath her.  She takes his hand, presses it onto her\nbreast.\n\n129. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)\nINSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE continues UNDERNEATH as RORSCHACH backs through\nthe kitchen with his bucket.  SMOKE billows in from the living room.\n\nHe empties TWO BOTTLES OF COOKING OIL on the linoleum floor.  Then he\nducks through a door into the BACK STAIRWELL.\n\n130. INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)\nRORSCHACH opens a bottle of CLEANING FLUID, stuffs a wad of newspaper\ninto its neck.  The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from\nthe smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov\ncocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.\n\nThe COPS pitch backward as the bottle blows up.  By the time they hit\nthe floor, the COOKING OIL has burst into flame.\n\nRORSCHACH bolts up the stairs; by now, another squad of CTU MEN is\ncoming up with back way behind him.\n\n131. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)\nCharred COPS, leaping FLAMES.  CAMERA ZEROES IN on the GAS STOVE.\n\n132. EXT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)\nA GAPING HOLE blows open in the front of the building.  FIERY RUBBLE\nhails down on the CTU units outside.  Re-enter Fats on vocals:\n\n\"S'posin' I should hug you and caress you? . . .\nWould it impress you? . . .\"\n\n133. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nLAURIE is fumbling with DREIBERG's pants.  Finally he can't stand it\nanymore -- and with a pained, stricken look he pushes her away and\nsits up on the sofa.  His head sinks into his hands.  At first she\ndoesn't understand; then her face softens, and she moves to his side,\nembracing his shoulders, gently stroking his hair.\n\n\". . . Or would it distress you?\"\n\n134. INT. TENEMENT - BACK STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)\nRORSCHACH huddled on the uppermost landing, just below roof level.\nBy now the whole building is ablaze.  Two flights down, a pair of CTU\nCOPS are fighting their way through the inferno, still on his tail.\n\nHe still has his mop bucket; it's half-full of water.  He reaches for\nhis last can -- a can of DRANO -- and empties it into the bucket,\nwhere it begins to HISS and SIZZLE.\n\n\"S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .\nWould you think I'm speaking out of turn . . .\"\n\nThe COPS are almost on him, racing upward two steps at a time.  He\nsteps out in front of them, and -- before they can hoist their\nweapons -- HEAVES THE BUCKETFUL OF BOILING DRANO into their faces.\n\nThe COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as\nRORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof.\n\n135. EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH emerges -- and a BLINDING LIGHT catches him full in the\nface.  Hovering not twenty feet overhead is a POLICE AIRSHIP -- a\nblimp-like craft of the sort we saw earlier.  A spray of MACHINE-GUN\nFIRE peppers the roof.\n\n\"S'posin' I declare it.\nWould you take my love and share it? . . .\"\n\nRORSCHACH scuttles along the edge of the roof, finds a rickety FIRE\nESCAPE, and dives over.  Unfortunately, he's now exposed on the front\nof the building -- pinned to the wall by gunfire from the SWAT TEAM on\nthe street.  TONGUES OF FLAME dart from nearby windows.  He turns and\ntries to climb back upward, but more COPS -- frm the just-landed\nAIRSHIP -- are already spilling over the edge of the roof.\n\n\"I ain't s'posin', I'm in love with you.\"\n\nThe song ends.  And on the last note, RORSCHACH emits an ungodly HOWL\nOF FURY -- diving over the metal railing, PLUNGING to the street\nbelow.\n\n136. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT\nThree stories down, he crashes into a cluster of garbage cans -- and\nlies there, spent, twisted, wracked with pain.  The CTU COPS are on\nhim instantly, kicking him, pummeling him with billy clubs and rifle\nbutts.\n\nCOPS\nGET HIM!  GET HIS MASK!  LET'S SEE THE LITTLE FUCKER'S FACE!!\n\nRORSCHACH\nGNAAAAHH!!  NO!! NO!!\n\nIn seconds the inkblot mask is off -- revealing a pocked, doughy face\ntopped off with a shock of MATTED RED HAIR.  It's a familiar\nface . . . the face of the STREET CRAZY who haunts the newsstand\nwith his placards announcing the end of the world.\n\nCOP\nChrist.  He's got five-inch heels.

NEWS KIOSK - EVENING\nThe familiar NEWS VENDOR peddling papers.  A feisty little BLACK KID\n-- the same one who made a face at RORSCHACH -- sits on the pavement\nnearby, reading a comic book.\n\nThe NEWS VENDOR nudges him, indicates the comic book: a patriotic\nlittle number entitled \"COLONEL NORTH AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS.\"\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nHey, this ain't a lending library.

This twisted vision of coitus bears the crayoned title \"MY\nDREAM by W.J. Kovacs, Age 13.\"\n\nIt's too strong to look at for long.

LONG and RORSCHACH sit in\nfolding chairs on opposite sides of a square table.  The doctor\nreaches into his briefcase and pulls out a stack of CARDS.\n\nDR. LONG\nNow, Walter, you obviously know what these are.  I want you to look\nat each card in turn and tell me what it reminds you of.  All\nright?\n\nRORSCHACH's face is bruised, bloodied, and blank.  DR. LONG turns up\nthe first card, a symmetrical inkblot, part of a Rorschach test.\n\nRORSCHACH\nButterfly.\n\nLONG nods, makes a notation on a pad, turns up the next card.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nSome nice flowers.\n\nLONG eyes him skeptically, makes another note, turns up the third\ncard.  RORSCHACH stares at it for a long moment.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nA doggy.  A big old floppy-eared dog.\n\nHe shows the hint of a smile.  DR. LONG heaves a sigh of\nfrustration.\n\nDR.

VEIDT INDUSTRIES PYRAMID - DAY\nA huge open atrium on the ground floor, with marble columns,\nfountains, eucalyptus trees -- an Egyptian pleasure garden.\nJUSTINE's hanging out with her video crew; they spot VEIDT on the\ncentral escalator and swing into action.\n\nJUSTINE\nAdrian!  Adrian!  Can you give us a comment of Rorschach?\n\nHe's not at all happy to see her.  His FLUNKIES -- bodyguards and\nsecretaries -- form a wedge around him as he tries to push past the\ncameras.\n\nVEIDT\nNo comment.\n\nJUSTINE\nDid you know he was back on the streets?\n\nVEIDT\nI did not.  Now get out of my way!\n\nJUSTINE\nIsn't it true that you --\n\nHe keeps walking, with JUSTINE in hot pursuit.  Then, wide-eyed, he\nSTOPS IN HIS TRACKS.  An ARMED GUNMAN has stepped out from behind a\npillar -- directly into VEIDT's path.\n\nASSASSIN\nVEIDT!\n\nVEIDT DIVES.  The ASSASSIN'S BULLET catches JUSTINE in the gut and\ncomes out the other side in a spray of blood.  With a gymnast's\nagility VEIDT rolls to the right -- and comes up with a BRASS ASHTRAY\nin his hands.\n\nHe swings it into the ASSASSIN'S RIBS, knocking him backward into a\nFOUNTAIN.  The GUN skitters off across the marble floor.\n\nAs the SECURITY STAFF races up, VEIDT steps INTO THE FOUNTAIN and\nslams the dazed ASSASSIN'S HEAD into a decorative bust of King\nTut.\n\nVEIDT\nSon of a bitch.  Who sent you?\n\nArms flying, the two men grapple.  VEIDT grabs hold of a ASSASSIN's\nhair and thrusts a HAND into his MOUTH.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nStand back, Mr. Veidt!  We'll handle it!\n\nVEIDT\nHe's got some kind of poison capsule.  Don't bite down, you\nscum, I want to know who sent you!\n\nThe ASSASSIN gags -- and GOES LIMP.  His lifeless body slumps down\ninto the water.  VEIDT steps out, shaken and breathless.\n\nVEIDT\nGoddammit . . .\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nWho'd wanna kill you, Mr. Veidt?\n\nVEIDT\nI don't know.

DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - DUSK\nTIGHT ON a portable TV tuned to the evening news.\n\nNEWSCASTER\n-- third day of rioting in major European capitals amid escalating\nfears of nuclear war.  In London, six people were trampled outside\nSt. Paul's cathedral when overflow crowds were turned away from\nmorning Mass --\n\nA PHONE RINGS.  DREIBERG, who's sprawled on his bed watching the TV,\nreaches for the receiver.\n\nDREIBERG\nYeah.\n(beat)\nAdrian!  What's up?\n\n143. INTERCUT VEIDT AND DREIBERG\nVEIDT\nIn have something to tell you.  I wanted to call before you heard it\non the news.\n(beat)\nSomeone tried to kill me today.\n\nFor a moment DREIBERG says nothing.  He's not altogether\nsurprised.\n\nDREIBERG\nWho?\n\nVEIDT\nI don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm\nstarting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?\n\nDREIBERG\nShe's with me.\n\nVEIDT\nGood.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.\n(beat)\nLook, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until\nall this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.\n\nDREIBERG\nThanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.\n\nHe hangs up and weighs his options while he stares at the box.\nLAURIE enters from the hallway, dressed in a bathrobe, toweling off\nher hair.\n\nLAURIE\nOhh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?\n\nDREIBERG\nOne more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.\n(beat)\n. . . First time I've ever heard him scared.\n\nHe doesn't say any more than that.  He doesn't have to.  LAURIE picks\nup on the implications immediately.  She exhales sharply, turns away\nfrom him and steadies herself against a bureau.\n\nDREIBERG\n-- What is it.\n\nLAURIE\nI know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't\naround.\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie --\n\nLAURIE\nI'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --\n\nDREIBERG\nWith any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.\n\nHis sour wisecrack starts her trembling -- almost crying.  DREIBERG,\nfed up with his own pessimism, climbs out of bed and walks over\nbehind her.\n\nLAURIE\nI shouldn't be here anyway, Daniel.  There's something I haven't told\nyou --\n\nBut before she does he shushes her, wraps his arms around her from\nbehind.\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie, I'm not afraid.  I want you with me.  I want it more than\nanything else in the world.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n144. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT\nCONVICTS lined up with metal trays at a long cafeteria-style serving\narea.  RORSCHACH enters in prison greys.  As he makes his way toward\nthe dinner line, we PICK UP a chorus of comments from the nearby\ntables:\n\nVOICE\nHey Rorschach.  You dead, man.  Just a matter of time now --\n\nVOICE II\nRorschach.  Better put some meat on that pretty ass of yours --\n\nLow, threatening CHUCKLES all around as an expressionless RORSCHACH\npicks up his tray.  A TRIO OF GOONS falls in behind him.  The\nsmallest of them outweighs him by a good forty pounds.\n\nGOON I\nDidn't know he was such a tiny little thing.\n\nGOON II\nLittle?  Naw, he's a big man.  Big man.\n\nRORSCHACH'S FACE shows no emotion.  He moves forward in the line.  A\nSERVER drops a gristly chunk of meat on his tin plate.\n\nGOON III\nI'd like to get his autograph.  I got my autograph book right here. .\n.\n\nGOON III reaches into his pocket and withdraws an ICEPICK.\n\nGOON III (cont.)\nNotched up some big names over the years.\n\nSuddenly RORSCHACH spins, catching GOON III's head with the edge of\nhis dinner tray.  The icepick clatters to the floor.  GOON III\nfollows.\n\nThe others are on him in an instant, PINNING HIM against the serving\ncounter.  Instead of resisting, RORSCHACH vaults backward.  He brings\na KNEE up into GOON II's chine, grabs a fistful of GOON I's hair, and\ntumbles back OVER THE COUNTER -- dragging GOON I's head, face down,\ninto a steam tray full of bubbling SOUP.\n\nLanding on his feet, keeping his grip on GOON I's hair, RORSCHACH\nuses his free hand to bury a FORK in a CAFETERIA WORKER's gut.  GOON\nII lunges at him across the counter.  He grabs a VAT off a nearby\nburner and, with a single sweep of the arm, DOUSES both GOONS -- with\nHOT COOKING FAT.\n\nAll this has taken five seconds maximum.  WHISTLES shriek as the two\ndisfigured GOONS writhe on the floor in hideous agony, faces cracked\nand smoking.  CAFETERIA WORKERS clear a path as PRISON GUARDS rush in\nwith billy clubs drawn.\n\nAs the GUARDS haul him off, RORSCHACH emits a ferocious HISS.  It\nsounds uncannily like the sizzle of boiling oil on human flesh.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n145. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - NIGHT\nA prison TRUSTY wheels a cart down a long, empty corridor --\ndelivering dinner to the prisoners in solitary confinement.  Some of\nthe cells are visible, through ordinary barred entries; others are\ntotally sealed off, with sliding service trays mounted in solid metal\ndoors.\n\nAt a cell of the latter kind, the TRUSTY knocks once on the door,\nthen throws back a small panel to reveal the impassive face of\nRORSCHACH.\n\nTRUSTY\nHey Rorschach.  Those cats you threw the grease on -- they're dyin'\nman.\n(beat)\nTheir friends are talkin' 'bout it.  Say if those two go under . . .\nthis whole place blows.\n\nRORSCHACH emits his trademark HISS and turns from the door.  The\nTRUSTY chuckles in anticipation.\n\nTRUSTY (cont.)\nI'd hate to be you, man.  Locked in here with the likes of --\n\nRORSCHACH\nI'm not locked in here with them.  They're locked in here with me.\n\nWith that, the panel slides suddenly SHUT in the TRUSTY's face.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n146. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nLONG and RORSCHACH have changed rooms.  The new room -- two chairs, a\nsquare table -- is identical to the first, except for the REINFORCED\nWIRE MESH which spans its width, separating doctor from patient.\n\nThrough a narrow opening in the wire, DR. LONG slides a card across\nthe table for RORSCHACH's inspection.  It's the same series of\ninkblots as before, the \"butterfly\" leading off.  But this time, the\nsubject has decided to cooperate:\n\nRORSCHACH\nA whore fucking.\n\nDR. LONG\nWho is she?  Do you know her?\n\nToo obvious; no response.  LONG moves on to card #2 -- the \"nice\nflowers\":\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nMan's guts.  Falling out of his shirt.\n\nLONG clears his throat almost imperceptibly and nods.  Card #3:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nDoggy.  Big old floppy-eared dog --\n(pause; then, smiling)\n-- with his skull split open.\n\nDR. LONG\nAnd what -- split -- the dog's skull open?\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhy, doctor.  I did.\n(beat)\nHe was a bad dog.\n\nRORSCHACH is toying with him now.  DR. LONG gets down to brass\ntacks.\n\nDR. LONG\nWalter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In\nyour mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?\n\nRORSCHACH\nGod isn't there to do it.\n\nDR. LONG\nWe don't know that.\n\nRORSCHACH eyes him for a moment, then nods sagely: oh yes we do.\n\nDR. LONG\nSo the rest of the world is wrong, and you're right.  Is that it?\n(no response)\nYou tried to help people once.  What turned you around?  -- Why\nwould you want to kill a dog?\n\nWith LONG firmly on the hook, RORSCHACH settles back to elucidate:\n\nRORSCHACH\nOne night I opened my eyes -- saw the world.\n\n147. EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\nRuined buildings, broken windows.  The streets are silent except for\nthe distant sound of dogs BARKING.  RORSCHACH'S NARRATION continues\nOVER SCENE:\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O.)\n'75.  Kidnap case, the little Franco girl.  Weeks dragged by -- no\nword.  Thought of little child, alone, frightened . . . decided to\nintervene.\n\nThe lone figure of RORSCHACH emerges from the shadows and turns up\nhis collar.  He strides deliberately down the sidewalk past a\nramshackle wooden storm fence covered with obscene graffiti.\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)\nGot a tip.  Abandoned dress factory in Brooklyn.\n\nHe peers through a broken slat in the fence.  In a side yard, TWO\nHUGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS growl playfully, fighting over some unseen\nobject.\n\n148. INT. DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\nA DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file,\nflicks on a flashlight.\n\nMannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The\nlight shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders\nover.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and\non the floor, a ROPE.\n\nThere's a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it,\nsticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a\ncharred scrap of FABRIC from a child's pajamas, decorated with\nballoons and teddy bears.\n\nHe stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden\nCHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding\nparaphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher's\nknives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh\nWINDOW.\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)\nDogs wouldn't shut up.  That's when I knew where the little girl had\ngone.\n\n149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\nThe German shepherds romp in the dying light.  We CLOSE IN ON the\ndogs until we see what it is they're tussling over: A BIG BLOODY KNOB\nOF BONE.\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)\nDecided to wait for the owner . . .\n\n150. INT. FACTORY - ENTRY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)\nKeys in the lock.  A moment later, the door swings wide;  a FAT MAN\nenters and whistles to the dogs.\n\nFAT MAN\nFred?  Barney?  Dinnerti--\n\nRORSCHACH steps out of the shadows and BASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD.\n\n151. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nRORSCHACH, master of suspense, decides to take a break in the\nstory.  He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his\nreply, asks:\n\nDR. LONG\nThen what happened?\n\nRORSCHACH\n. . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had\nto break in.\n\n152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)\nThe FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He's\nhandcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a\nGROCERY SACK.\n\nHe kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off\nhis glove and reaches into the sack.\n\nFAT MAN\nWhat -- what are you d--\n\nRORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER\ninto his open mouth.  He's got several pounds of the stuff, and he\nspends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN's face,\nthroat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he's\ndone, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER\nBLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN's head.\n\nFRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door,\nand -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs\ninside.\n\nThen he stands back and enjoys the carnage.\n\n153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nDR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things\nup.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhen they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their\nskulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies.\n(leaning forward)\nSee, God didn't kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed\nher . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did,\nhe did't seem to mind.\n\nDR. LONG\nThat man, then, he was the first.  The first you --\n\nRORSCHACH\nSaw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make\nit that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.\n(slight smile)\nWhat else can I illuminate?\n\nLONG's had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the\nPRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he\npoints a finger at LONG's inkblot.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nNo right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . .\njust a man's face.\n(pause)\nSee it now?\n\nThe GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a\ncouple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a\nsecond he reaches for his briefcase; as he's gathering his cards, he\nSTOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern\non top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.\n\nLONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the\nRorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n154. EXT. BARN - TOWARD DUSK\nA rural tree-lined area outside the city.  A COMPACT BUBBLE-CAR pulls\nup outside a big ramshackle barn and stops; DREIBERG gets out, goes to\nthe padlocked doors, fumbles in his pocket for a key.\n\nAfter a moment, LAURIE wanders up beside him.\n\nLAURIE\nEnough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?\n\nDREIBERG\nMemory lane.\n\nHe opens the padlock, ushers LAURIE inside.\n\n155. INT. BARN - A MOMENT LATER\nInside the barn is a HUGE OBLONG SHAPE covered with a TARPAULIN.\n\nLAURIE\nDaniel . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nGimme a hand with the tarp, would you?  You take that side.\n\nShe goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull\nit back to reveal . . .\n\nTHE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL's high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It's a bit\ntarnished from years of disuse, but it's still an impressive sight.\nDREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around\nto join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.\n\nLAURIE\nThe Owlship.  I can't believe it.\n\nDREIBERG\n-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.\n\n156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on\nthe electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin,\nreliving days gone by.\n\nLAURIE\nWow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?\n\nDREIBERG\nI took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some\ncows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.\n\nLAURIE\nAntarctica??\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come\nalong.\n(pause)\nI've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a\nbad place to sit out a war.\n\nLAURIE\nWould you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be\nleft.\n\nDREIBERG\nYou and me.\n\nHe looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her\ngaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the\ncabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly\nrejected.\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . Yeah, you're right.  Probably wouldn't make it down there\nanyway.\n\nBehind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She's just\nopened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES\n-- their old superhero togs.\n\nLAURIE\nDan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.\n\nDREIBERG\nMe neither.  Mine barely even fits.\n(chuckling)\nThe thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping\npeople, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't\nknow.  It all seems so abstract.\n\nLAURIE's holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing\nherself in a small mirror above a sink.\n\nLAURIE\nGod, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat are you up to?\n\nLAURIE\nDon't look.  Turn around.\n\nSmirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the\ncabin.\n\nDREIBERG\nThis'd better not be what I think it is.\n\nLAURIE\nOkay!\n\nDREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE's in full costume, looking quite\nimposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns\nshock:\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nMy God, it's the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender\nof the weak!\n\nLAURIE\nIn the flesh.\n\nShe ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind,\nand strokes his thinning hair.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nPoor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don't you.\n\nDREIBERG\nSaving the world?  I guess I do.\n(smiling)\nMaybe we can still save ourselves . . .\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n157. EXT.

FIGHTS break out; COPS start\nswinging rifle butts.\n\nAs PRO-NUKERS swarm the stage, our gaze turns upward.  A trio of\nHOVERCRAFT hangs in the air above the seaport.

Faces turn skyward; fingers point --\n\n-- and suddenly, the footage we're watching undergoes a SUBTLE\nTRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the\naction QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we're in\nfull-color and real-time --\n\n163. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\n-- because the Owlship is really there . . . and by God, the\nWatchmen are back in action a quarter-mile above the South St.\nSeaport!\n\n164. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe three CTU SHIPS are now visible through the cockpit dome.\n\nDREIBERG\nOkay Laurie, let's see if we've still got what it takes.\n\nOn the panel, a COMPUTER TARGETING DEVICE homes in on a CTU SHIP.\n\n165. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT\nA RADAR MAN stares at his console in puzzlement.\n\nCTU RADAR MAN\nSir, we've got an odd blip off starboard . . .\n\nThe ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY as a sudden EXPLOSION --\n\n166. AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT\n-- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured\nship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets\nsputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against\nthe water.\n\n167. ANGLE ON CROWD\npointing at the skies in disbelief.\n\nVOICE IN CROWD\nLOOK!  UP THERE!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD II\nOh my God, it's --\n\n\n168. INT. OWLSHIP - ON DREIBERG\nHe barks into a microphone:\n\nDREIBERG\nAttention CTU!  Cease fire immediately --\n\n169. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK\nGround level.  From the midst of the bewildered CROWD we watch as the\nOWLSHIP and the CTU talk some serious trash:\n\nOWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER\n-- or we'll BLOW YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE SKY!\n\nCTU LOUDSPEAKER\nUNREGISTERED CRAFT.  IDENTIFY YOURSELF.\n\nOWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER\nBABY . . . WE'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.\n\nThe crowd's in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But\na dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the\nstrange sight overhead.\n\nVOICE IN CROWD\n. . . IT'S THE WATCHMEN!!\n\nEXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air,\nclumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging\nimmobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West\nshowdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate\ninto position.\n\n170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.\n\nDREIBERG\nWe're gonna have to shave this one close.\n\nAn instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle\nFULL-FORWARD.\n\n171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\nWith a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS\nCONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond\nbefore -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES\nFORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD\nCHEERS.\n\n172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nDREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the\naft view from the ship.\n\nLAURIE\nThey're following us.\n\nDREIBERG\nAll right.  Mission accomplished.\n\nHe's no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the\nship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.\n\n173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU\nSHIPS rip past on either side.\n\n174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT\nASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The\nOWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE\nblows a HOLE in its facade.\n\n175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\nfiring TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.\n\n176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar\nreadout:\n\nLAURIE\nMissed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.\n\nLAURIE\n(checking the monitor)\nThey're practically on us . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nThat Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.\n\nHe punches a button on the dash.  It's labelled \"TURBO.\"\n\n177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP\nThe turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving\nthe CTU craft in the dust.\n\n178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT\nA line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly,\nand -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.\n\nA moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The\nless-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and\nEXPLODES\n\nThe SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last\nmoment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP\nITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles\nfor the airborne route.\n\n179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER\nThe OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the\ncars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.\n\nThere's an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges\nUP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS\nagainst the roof of the tunnel.\n\n180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe end of the tunnel is coming up fast.\n\nDREIBERG\nFog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.\n\n181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an\nalmost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its\nwake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives --\nbut, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward\non a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the\nwater.\n\n182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nThey're in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of\nintense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.\n\nLAURIE\nWe lost him.\n\nHe flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she\nshakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nOh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.\n\nFADE THROUGH TO:\n\n183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT\nThe usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving\nline.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall\nand falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of\nhim.\n\nTRUSTY\nJust left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.\n\nThe CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes\nthrough the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds,\nit's reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named\nT-BONE.\n\nCON IN LINE\nOtis went down.\n\nT-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of\nSIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the\nbiggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET:\nLITTLE BIGGER.\n\nT-BONE\nJust heard, boss.  Otis bought it.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nFuckin' Rorschach.\n(nodding to himself)\nThis joint goes up.  Tonight.\n\n184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nDrifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship\nemerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale\nblue moonlight.\n\n185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nThrough the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then\ndisappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We're taking a dreamy tour\nof the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is\nsinging \"You're My Thrill.\"\n\nInstruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one's at the\ncontrols.\n\nThe ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the\nwidth of the cabin floor.  A woman's hand reaches for it, sets it\nright.\n\nIt's LAURIE, who's midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG.\nThe pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the\ncabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.\n\nLAURIE\nBetter.  Much better.\n\nDREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile\ninstead.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nI bet I know what made the difference this time.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat?\n\nLAURIE\n(smirking)\nThe costumes.  Am I right?\n\nDREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite\nhimself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nCome on.  Admit it!\n\nDREIBERG\nNo way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.\n\nLAURIE\nYes you are.\n\nDREIBERG\n(drily)\nNo offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.\n(pause; then, seriously)\nTonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's because --\n\nDREIBERG\nIt's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's\nabout to end.\n(a weird smile)\nI feel like I could save it.\n\nHe grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to\nthe instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship\nhard right.\n\nLAURIE\nYou're full of yourself.  What are you doing?\n\nDREIBERG\nLong as we're on the subject of perverts . . .\n(turning to face her)\nI miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.\n\nLAURIE\n. . . What??\n\nDREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches\nfor the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.\n\n186. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT\nAFTERBURNERS belch flame as the Owlship accelerates, ripping through\nthe clouds above the city.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n187. SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PRISON\n-- and as Sly Stone once said, there's a riot goin' on.  SIRENS HOWL\nas we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild:\ndisabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons,\nthrowing food.\n\n188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG's eyes are\nriveted to a monitor over the controls:\n\nDREIBERG\nI think we're just a trifle late.\n\nLAURIE\nJesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .\n\nThe MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below\nthem.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire\nwith the guards in the watchtower.  It's an ugly, bloody mess.\n\nDREIBERG\nI know he's totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen\ntimes.\n\n189. INT. CELL - NIGHT\nSIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs\ndrawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.\n\n190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT\nSmoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past\nsprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR\nMENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It's the\npsychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE,\nand T-BONE.\n\nWheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop\noutside RORSCHACH's cell and GRIN in anticipation.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nFind an outlet for this thing\n(shouting)\nRorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It's payback time!\n\nRAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying\na big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH's\ndoor, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.\n\nCARLOS\nSee this, runt?  We're gonna take your puny little balls off . . .\nand pickle 'em!!\n(chortling)\nAww!  I think he just wet his pants!\n\nHILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place\nat the panel in the door:\n\nT-BONE\nLemme see.  Lemme see!\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nRelax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve.\n(to T-BONE)\nWhat's he doin' now?\n\nNo response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed\ntightly to the panel.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER (cont.)\nYou deaf?  I said, what's he --\n\nHe gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE's legs buckle and he topples over\nbackwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON\nquivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye\nsocket.\n\nRAFE\nBOSS!  JESUS!\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nSon of a bitch! -- WE'RE COMING RORSCHACH.  WE'RE GONNA PEEL YOU LIKE\nA GRAPE.\n(to RAFE)\nLight the torch.\n\nRAFE ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of\nRORSCHACH's cage.\n\n191. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT\nRORSCHACH waiting patiently on his bunk.  The metal lock on the\ninside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n192. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG hands LAURIE what looks like a pair of electronic\nEARMUFFS.\n\nDREIBERG\nOkay, I'm turning on the screamers.  We'll have to hit the roof\nrunning . . .\n\nHe throws a switch on the control panel.\n\n193. EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nWINDOWS SHATTER in the guard towers as a WAILING ULTRASONIC SCREECH\nsplits the air.  On the roof of the complex, PARALYZED GUARDS drop\ntheir weapons; ESCAPED PRISONERS clutch at their burst eardrums as\nthe Owlship descends and gently touches down. . .\n\n194. INT. RORSCHACH'S CELL - THAT MOMENT\nThe LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH'S\nFACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the\nwall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his\nTOILET.\n\nGrunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its\nmounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is\nFLOODED.\n\n195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER\nRAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.\n\nRAFE\nOkay, boss, that oughta do it.\n\nThey give the door a shove.  It swings inward, and GALLONS OF WATER\ncome gushing out.  LITTLE BIGGER steps back in disgust.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nWHAT THE --\n\nRAFE and CARLOS gape into the cell.  They see the broken toilet, but\nthere's no trace of RORSCHACH.\n\nCARLOS\nRorschach.  Company's calling . . .\n\nRAFE\nWhere is the fuckin' runt?\n\nCARLOS advances cautiously toward the cell, the CLEAVER in his\nfist.\n\n196. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT\nIn answer to RAFE's question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door.\nHe SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO's outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of\nthe LOCK catches CARLO'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .\n\n. . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS,\nmonkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide\nand an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.\n\nCARLOS\nYOU'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --\n\nFrom the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor\nBETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --\n\n-- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --\n\n-- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do\na herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --\n\n-- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock\nDIM and DIE.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down\noff his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies\nof the dead.\n\nRORSCHACH\nYour move . . . runt.\n\nThe midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor\nas fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.\n\n197. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER\nDREIBERG and LAURIE move down a dark, abandoned corridor, trying to\nget their bearings.\n\nLAURIE\nWhere are we?  What happened to the lights?\n\nDREIBERG\nGenerators'll kick on in a minute.  We should be close to solitary .\n. .\n\nTheir heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND\nCORRIDOR crosses the one they're standing in.  As they watch, a\nSCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.\n\nDREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a\nfamiliar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . Rorschach??\n\nRORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second\nand a half -- then keeps on walking.\n\n198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER\nThe terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he's just hit a dead end.  He\nthrows a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him.\nDesperate, he ducks into a MEN'S ROOM.\n\nRORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him,\nLAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross\ncorridor.\n\nLAURIE\nRorschach!  Is that you??\n\nHe turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and\ndispassionate, he enters the MEN's room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand\nat the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat's he doing?\n\nDREIBERG\nI think he's going to the john.\n\nLAURIE\nMy God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and\nhe stops to take a --\n\nBefore she can finish, RORSCHACH reemerges, wiping his hands on a\npaper towel.  He wanders up to join them without so much as a\n\"howdy.\"\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . That was quick.\n\nRORSCHACH\nToilet clogged.  Short fat turd.\n(beat)\nLet's get out of here.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n199. EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT\nA well-concealed RUNWAY somewhere in the heart of the Rocky\nMountains.  LIGHTS sweep the sky as GROUND CREWS run to and fro.\n\nAir Force One is coming in for a landing.\n\n200. INT. UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER\nLots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling\nabout.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and\nwhat looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal\nramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON's in the passenger seat, and there's an\nimposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating\na long stay.\n\nPRESIDENT NIXON\nHello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY\nShe's all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right\naway.\n\nLIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless\ncorridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY (cont.)\nWeatherman says we're lookin' good.  We've got a fourteen-hour\nwindow.\n\nPRESIDENT NIXON\nFourteen hours, huh?\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY\nFourteen hours.  Unless of course the reds decide to hit us first.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n201. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nLAURIE's following the Watchmen press coverage on an overhead screen\n. . .\n\nNEWSCASTER\n-- in a daring midnight jailbreak.  Earlier eyewitness reports place\nthe one-time superheroes at a peace rally in --\n\n. . . while DREIBERG and RORSCHACH sit side-by-side at the control\nconsole, occupied by other matters.\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his\nmangy cat on me.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat new information?\n\nRORSCHACH\nBlake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan\nsomehow involved . . .\n(scratching his chin)\n\nStrange that no one's tried to attack you, Daniel.\n\nThere's an unmistakable tone of suspicion in his voice.  DREIBERG,\nhighly offended, shoots him a look of supreme resentment.\n\nDREIBERG\nI beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.\n\nLAURIE\nWill you two lovebirds keep it down?\n\nStill grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at\nthe monitor LAURIE's watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the\nscreen:\n\nNEWSCASTER\n. . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was\nunavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the\nAntarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.\n\nRORSCHACH\n\"Ozone layer\"?\n\nDREIBERG\n(rolling his eyes)\nChrist.  Couldn't he just admit that he's scared??\n\nCUT TO:\n\n202. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT\nThe last rays of sunlight bleed toward endless frozen plains of\npristine white.  A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous\nstrip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered\naround what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is\none.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT's Antarctic retreat.\n\n203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT\nThe entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian\nstyle as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad\nfigure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered\nLYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him.\nOne of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a\nsilver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back\nof the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.\n\nLACKEY\nWelcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.\n\nVEIDT\nFeed Bubastis.  I'll have dinner when I've looked in on the world.\n\nThey hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him\nto:\n\n204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT\nThe room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated\nREMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair,\nRED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.\n\nVEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal\na towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid,\npicking up transmissions from all over the world.  It's far more\ninformational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp,\na hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in\nand his eyes begin to rove.\n\n205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL\nPANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials,\nsitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled \"LONDON.\"\nVEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER'S VOICE\ncomes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense\nlogo . . .\n\nBBC NEWSCASTER\n-- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as\npossible.  Cinderblock walls are preferred, but a makeshift shelter\ncan be constructed of sandbags, or of boxes filled with --\n\nFLICK, and the sound dies.  VEIDT's gaze drifts several screens to\nthe right, to the monitor labelled \"WASHINGTON D.C.\"  Sound up:\n\nNEWSCASTER\n-- amid rumors that top-ranking officials and military personnel have\nalready been relocated to underground bunkers.  White House spokesmen\ninsist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing\nnegotiations --\n\nFLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the\nbottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT's antarctic\nretreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new\nangle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are\nclear.  FLICK --\n\n-- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we're\nwatching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from\ntwenty-some years ago; he's sitting at a table in the Gila Flas\ncanteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he's getting ready to\npropose.\n\n206. REVERSE ANGLE - ON VEIDT\neyeing young Osterman with a strange, grave smile.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n207. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT\nLOW ANGLE on the Owlship as it descends slowly through the clouds.\nOn its underbelly, a VIDEO CAMERA grinds and rotates.\n\n208. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of\nthe city.  He punches up a series of PROGRESSIVE MAGNIFICATIONS,\ngradually zeroing in on a single city block.  It's been cordoned off,\nPOLICE BUBBLE-CARS are parked up and down its length.\n\nDREIBERG\nThey've got my building surrounded.\n(looking up at her)\nThey must've been following you all along.\n\nShe stares at him.  The ship LURCHES as DREIBERG kicks in the\naccelerator jets and takes off into the clouds.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nSo much for Dan Dreiberg, ordinary citizen.\n\nLAURIE\nWelcome back, Night Owl.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?\n\nRORSCHACH\nCTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat do you mean, frame-up?\n\nRORSCHACH\nObvious pattern -- all ties in --\n\nDREIBERG\nAre you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to\nget back at us?\n(spreading his hands)\nWhat about all those poor shits with cancer?\n\nTIGHT ON LAURIE, who's listening to all this with mounting\ndistress.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHow do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive\npropaganda scheme . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nCome on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --\n\nLAURIE\n(interrupting him)\nIt's not.\n\nRORSCHACH\nNot what?\n\nLAURIE\nNot \"propaganda.\"\n(pause; then, blurting it out --)\nChrist, I'm one of them!  I've got it.\n\nDREIBERG swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at LAURIE, his face\nbone-white.  She stares at the floor, afraid to meet his eyes, her\ngrim secret revealed.  For an awkward moment neither of them can\nthink of anything to say.\n\nThen RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the \"case,\" breaks the\nsilence.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHnrrr -- changes everything.  Let's get moving.\n\n209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he\npries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily\nat a RAT which scampers out of the hole.  The OWLSHIP hovers\nabove.\n\n210. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG, disconsolate, holds LAURIE gently by the shoulders.\n\nLAURIE\nI should've told you, Dan.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted things between\nus to be -- happy.  For a while.  I --\n\nDREIBERG\nIt doesn't change a thing, Laurie.  I love you.\n\nHe tries to pull her close but she turns away, her eyes welling up\nwith tears.\n\nLAURIE\nI love you too, Dan, I -- why don't you give me a minute to get\nmyself together, okay?\n\n211. EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nA distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP.\nRORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of\nsatisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees\nDREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.\n\nAbove their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.\n\n212. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nLAURIE backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona\nresolves itself into the figure of DR. MANHATTAN.\n\nLAURIE\nJon.  What are you doing here?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.\n\nLAURIE\nCollect me?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nIn the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye.\nYou're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .\n\nLAURIE\nJon, no -- I can't --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nIt will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us\ncan do anything to change it.\n\nDREIBERG's frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside\nthe cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR.\nMANHATTAN's hand.\n\nDREIBERG\nLAURIE!  DON'T --\n\nHands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and\nLAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.\n\nStunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There's obviously nothing he can\ndo.  RORSCHACH is only a second or two behind them.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhere's Laurie?\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't think she's coming with us.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n213. EXT. MARS - NIGHT\nA BLUE SLIT opens in the sky, mere inches above the Martian\nsurface;  DR. MANHATTAN steps placidly through, and a moment later\nLAURIE tumbles out behind him.  She takes a couple of halting steps,\nthen GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red\nsands.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN's gone several paces before he realizes there's a\nproblem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at\nthe air, trying and failing to draw a breath.  He walks patiently back\nand extends his hand;  LAURIE grabs it, and is magically surrounded by\na HALO OF OXYGEN.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThe atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.\n\nLAURIE\nJesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --\n\nIgnoring her, he turns.  She hurries to keep pace with him.  Then she\nstops in her tracks.\n\nBefore her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN's new abode: a\nPALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren\nsands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS,\nsurrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and\npendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering\ncrystalline castle.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI live here now.\n\nHe strides placidly forward.  LAURIE, boggled, stumbles along after\nhim.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n214. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nTIGHT ON the distraught DREIBERG, his pained face illuminated by the\nglow of the instrument panel.  RORSCHACH sits calmly behind him.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHeading south.  What's the plan?\n\nDREIBERG\nWe're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're\nhightailing it down to Adrian's.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --\n\nDREIBERG\n(exploding)\nCases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to\nend.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't\nmatter.\n\nRORSCHACH\nCoward.  Giving up.\n\nDREIBERG\nSHUT UP, Rorschach.\n\nRORSCHACH settles back, lets out a soft, thoughtful HISS.\n\nRORSCHACH\nSorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.\n(pause)\nSorry about Laurie.\n\nDREIBERG\n(choked voice)\nOkay, let's just . . . thank you.\n\nFor a few moments they fly on in silence.  RORSCHACH can't leave well\nenough alone.  Deep in thought, he scratches his chin.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt's not stupid.  Could have angle.  -- Might be good move.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n215. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT\nLAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals\naround the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the\nenormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING\n-- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.\n\nLAURIE\nThis whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me\nyou're sleeping with Dreiberg.\n\nLAURIE\nYou -- you know about me and Dan?\n\nHe gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nTime is the key, Laurie.  If I can unlock the origins of time, I'll\nfinally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity.\n\nLAURIE looks at him crosseyed -- and heaves a sigh.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?\n(flustered)\nDan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks\nat me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of\natoms.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\n(startled)\nThen you're sleeping with Dreiberg?\n\nLAURIE\nWell, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThat's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even\nmy responses.\n(nodding)\nWe're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  --\nThirty seconds.\n\nShe GROANS in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle\nof the huge glass tower.  The Martian plains spread out for miles\nbelow them; above, the stars stretch to infinity.  A chill, violent\nWIND whips across their faces.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'll be here for the next year or so.  Then I'm going to work my way\nout toward the edge of the universe.\n(staring out at the landscape)\nUtterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn't it beautiful?\n\nShe moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and\nfissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and\nfrightened.\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me\nonce?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.\n\nLAURIE\nYet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be\nbeing with me.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't\nknow what did.\n\nLAURIE\nBut you knew that I'd -- die.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nMemories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to\ndwell on the unpleasant ones . . .\n(pause)\nYou won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.\n\nLAURIE's blood runs cold as she realizes what he's telling her.\n\nLAURIE\nThen it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've\nalways known.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\n(nodding)\nAlways.  Ever since the day I died.\n\nHe walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the\nforbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in\nher hands.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\nDo you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it's been like for me\nthese last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be\ndestroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless\nagent of its destruction?\n\nLAURIE\n(sobbing)\nThen why don't you . . . do something about it!\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nBecause --\n\nLAURIE\nBecause you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.\n(angrily)\nJon.  This, this \"script\" you're following . . . who writes it?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six\nhundred years.\n\nThat about tears it for LAURIE.  She storms over and grabs him by the\nshoulders:\n\nLAURIE\nI can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to\ndie I want to be with -- other people.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nPlease, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a\nuniverse to explore.  I'll be alone.\n(reaching for her hand)\nYou're the last human being I'll ever see.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n216. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP streaking through the icy stratosphere above the south\nAtlantic.  Suddenly it BOUNCES in midair -- JERKS to the right -- and\nbegins to SPIRAL DOWNWARD into the clouds . . .\n\n217. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG is frantically throwing switches as they lurch to and fro.\nFinally he manages to get the ship righted.  RORSCHACH's taken a bad\ntumble; he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks:\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhat happened?\n\nDREIBERG\nThe guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some\nkind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhat caused it?\n\nDREIBERG\nDon't know.  Nothing I can think of --\n(apprehensively)\n-- outside of a nuclear blast.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n218. EXT. ANTARCTICA - KARNAK - NIGHT\nVEIDT'S VAST COMPLEX is little more than a DIM GLOW, barely visible\nthrough a SWIRLING BLIZZARD.\n\n219. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nVEIDT sits before his VIDEO WALL, sipping mulled wine from a goblet.  Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled \u00b3MOSCOW\u00b2 and \u00b3WASHINGTON, D.C.\u00b2 -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.\n\nA second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.  VEIDT leans back in his chair and cocks an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed.\n\n220. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP streaks downward through a TOTAL WHITEOUT.\n\n221. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThrough the cockpit, KARNAK\u00b9s visible -- for an instant.  Then, it\u00b9s lost in the snows again.\n\nDREIBERG\nI\u00b9m taking her down.\n(frantically throwing switches)\nRadar\u00b9s blown.  I\u00b9ll have to wing it.  Strap in, Rorschach --\n\nThe SHIP ROCKS with the force of a premature IMPACT.\n\n222. EXT. ANTARCTICA - ON OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe OWLSHIP takes a HARD BOUNCE against the snow.  The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.\n\nA HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They\u00b9re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.\n\n223. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nVEIDT\u00b9s eyeing the closed-circuit SECURITY MONITOR which shows the exterior of the complex.  He spots TWO TINY FIGURES slogging through the blizzard.\n\nAs he watches, the screens for \u00b3LONDON\u00b2 and \u00b3PARIS\u00b2 go WHITE.\n\n224. EXT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER\nDREIBERG and RORSCHACH, half-frozen and covered in frost, make it to the great metal entry doors -- and START BANGING.  A VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the door rotates into position.  A soothing, computerized WOMAN\u00b9S VOICE announces:\n\nVOICE\nWelcome to Karnak.  Please identify yourself.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian!  It\u00b9s Dreiberg.  For God\u00b9s sake open the doors.\n\nNothing happens.  DREIBERG POUNDS against the doors.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nAdrian!  We\u00b9re freezing to death out here!\n\nHe slumps to the ground exhausted, barely able to draw a breath.  The snow lies in FOUR-FOOT DRIFTS against the door.\n\nRORSCHACH\n. . . He\u00b9s not coming, Daniel.\n\n225. INT KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nOn the surveillance monitor, RORSCHACH and DREIBERG shamble off.  VEIDT stands, hits his remote.  The picture dies -- leaving a mere 199 screens in operation.\n\nThe wall is now checkerboarded with monitors showing nothing but VIDEO SNOW.  As VEIDT strides calmly out of the room, \u00b3PRAGUE\u00b2 goes white.\n\n226. EXT. KARNAK - NIGHT\nDREIBERG on his knees, half-buried in snow.  He topples forward, unable to go on.  A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enter frame and YANK HIM UPWARD.\n\nDREIBERG\nCan\u00b9t move . . . we\u00b9re done for.\n\nRORSCHACH\nCome on.  Found an exhaust vent.\n\nRORSCHACH drags the helpless DREIBERG around the side of the complex, where SNOW blows in flurries at the mouth of a TUNNEL-LIKE STRUCTURE.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nVeidt.  It\u00b9s been Veidt all along.  He\u00b9ll pay for this.\n\n227. INT. KARNAK - DINING HALL - NIGHT\nVEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall, coolly eating dinner.  Behind him, above the mammoth entry doors, hangs a TAPESTRY -- Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot.\n\nTWO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall.\n\nVEIDT sits calmly, betraying nothing.  At his side, the MUTANT LYNX\ngrowls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal's\nneck: quiet, girl.\n\nRORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN\nFLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening\nscene.  Suddenly . . .\n\nRORSCHACH\nVEIDT!\n\nVEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall;\nit catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG\nbacks against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward\nhim, TEETH BARED.\n\nVEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a\nfuturistic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along --\npart of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?\n\nRORSCHACH\nHe's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --\n\nVEIDT\nYeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of\ncourse . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nThe missing scientists.\n\nVEIDT\nUh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked\nat Gila Flats.\n\nRORSCHACH\nGila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .\n\nVEIDT\nDr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save\nthe world.\n\n228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nGun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak.\nRORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping\nat his heels.\n\nVEIDT\nBlake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers\n-- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn't Russia.\n(tapping his chest)\nIt was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill\nhim.  The rest of it -- Rorschach's capture, my \"assassination\" --\nthat was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting\nrid of Dr. Manhattan.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat??\n\nVEIDT\nI couldn't let him interfere with my project.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt.  You're the one who started World War III.\n\nVEIDT\nNo.  I just hastened the inevitable.\n(smiling)\nHe's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a\nlittle push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates\ncancer.\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie?  You're responsible for --\n\nVEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls\nout a smoke and strikes it against the box.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nOne thing I've learned about cancer -- it's much easier to generate\nthan it is to cure.\n\nDREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the\nstun gun across DREIBERG's face, knocking him to the floor -- and\nLEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.\n\nVEIDT\nLet's get something straight.  If you try that again, I'll kill you\nwithout a moment's thought.\n\nThey've reached the entrance to VEIDT's information room.  200\nSCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them\ninside.\n\nRORSCHACH\nCall off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.\n\nVEIDT\nBefore you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking\nat.\n\n229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nVEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand\ncorner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila\nFlats, reassembling a WATCH.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat is this?  It looks like Jon.\n\nVEIDT\nIt is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr.\nManhattan.\n\nDREIBERG\nGood Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?\n\nVEIDT\nIt's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him,\nLAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she's\nhit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On\nMars.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can't die.  It's a\nmystery I'd like to penetrate.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, I do not want to hear it.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .\n\nLAURIE\n(shaking her head)\nOh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYou're the only human being I care for.\n\nLAURIE\nThen do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter\na bit.\n(pause)\nI want you to cure me.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI won't do that.\n\nLAURIE\nYou have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.\n\nLAURIE\nJon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you\n-- then do it.\n\nEyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her\nchest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.\n\nHer fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR.\nMANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he's got to make the\nhardest decision of his life.  And then . . .\n\nA BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN\nINTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian\nlandscape altogether.\n\nWith a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see\nthe figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great\nwhite VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the\nMartian desert gradually materialize around them.\n\nThe two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like\nstatues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what's happened.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat -- am I --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nCured, yes.\n\nUtterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a\nhandrail for support.  He looks like a man who's just had a heart\nattack.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, what is it?  What's the matter?\n\nWhen he looks up at her, he's DESOLATE -- his face filled with\nDREAD.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nSomething. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It's all gone blank on\nme.  -- I can't remember the future.\n\nSlowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around\nhim.\n\nLAURIE\nJon.  Let's go back to Earth.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT\nVEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F.\nroom at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring\nmachinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.\n\nInside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON\nOSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY's watch into\nits brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching\nhim from twenty-four years in the future.\n\nVEIDT\nGentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.\n(pause)\nStand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat is it?  How does it work?\n\nVEIDT\nIt's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow\nbackward in time.\n(smiling)\nThere are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing\nparallel to our own --\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian -- you've lost it.\n\nVEIDT\n(pointing at the tachyon bubble)\nI've seen them!  I've seen them in there.\n(pause)\n\nIn some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it\nsurvives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.\n\nHe draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nThe creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war.\n(wild-eyed)\nDo you understand now?  Do you see what I\u00b9m going to do?  I\u00b9m going to change the past!\n\n232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT\nDR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.\n\nLAURIE\nWe\u00b9re too late.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nIt\u00b9s very strange.  Time\u00b9s flowing backwards . . .\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- what??\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThe south pole.  Time\u00b9s flowing backwards.\n\n233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\nInside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY\u00b9s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.\n\nVEIDT\nAt first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.\n\nHe steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.\n\nVEIDT\nIt ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds.\n(turning to face them)\nIn a minute I\u00b9ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I\u00b9ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman\u00b9s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.\n\nDREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.\n\nRORSCHACH\n. . . And they call me a fucking nut.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian.  It\u00b9s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.\n\nVEIDT\nDon\u00b9t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won\u00b9t even be here, will we?\n\nDREIBERG\nAnd what if you\u00b9re wrong?\n\nVEIDT\nI\u00b9m not.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat if you\u00b9re wrong??\n\nVEIDT\nThen I\u00b9ve been a very bad boy and you\u00b9ll have to spank me.  Christ!\n(shouting)\nI\u00b9m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!\n\n234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nA POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThat\u00b9s it.  That\u00b9s the source of the time disturbance.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, where are we?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nVeidt\u00b9s complex.\n\n235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\n\nTwenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler\u00b9s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:\n\nVEIDT\nYour problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years\nchasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . .\nas if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.\n\nDREIBERG\nYou ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist\nbullshit is going to save the world?\n\nVEIDT\nWe'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.\n\nHe kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum.\nThen he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.\n\n236. VEIDT'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS\nIn the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears\na SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .\n\n237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\nA LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon\nbubble.  There's a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up\n--  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the\ntrigger . . .\n\n. . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.\nVEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .\n\n. . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with\nLAURIE at his side.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?\n\nVEIDT\nJon!  Get back!  You don't understand.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees\nhimself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of\nthe I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he's\nsurprised.\n\nIn the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to\nsidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN\nTHE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.\n\nVEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE's directly in his path.  He\nshoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and\npoints his STUN GUN directly at her --\n\n-- and a millisecond later, he\u00b9s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.\n\nVEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN\u00b9s outstretched finger --\n\nVEIDT\nNO!!!!\n\n-- and in the wink of an eye, he\u00b9s VAPORIZED.  All that\u00b9s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.\n\nDREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat was he doing?\n\nDREIBERG\nTrying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nHe was right.\n\nRORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nHe did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It\u00b9s so elegant.  It\u00b9s so obvious.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\u00b9s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.\n\nLAURIE\nJon --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nSpace and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- for God\u00b9s sake, what do you see?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!\n\nHe lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz\naround his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the\nroom dim; it's as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the\nworld into his own massive frame.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nMy work here is finished . . .\n\nThe others cower.  They sense that something large is about to\nhappen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the\ntest chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the\ntiny\nhole in time.\n\nHe does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS\ninto a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND\nSTEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.\n\n238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\nJON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter\nbewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling\ngloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nDon't be afraid, Jon.  I'll be here with you.\n\nA second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps\nforward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.\n\nFor a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN's frame\nsurrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR.\nMANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the\nchamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across\nthe shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he\nspreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding\nFLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging\nwith nothingness . . .\n\n. . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue\nlight dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he's\nalive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.\n\n239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER\nThe timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of\nhis awed colleagues, who've seen everything through the observation\npanel.\n\nSCIENTIST\nWhat in the name of God . . .\n\nThe SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY,\nsobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As\nshe clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he\nlooks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .\n\nJON\nYour watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --\n\nSCIENTIST II\nLOOK!!\n\nThe SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber .\n. . which isn't there.  Instead, there's a rippling, irregular\nRUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are\nthree odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and\nRORSCHACH.\n\n240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT'S LAB - THE PRESENT\nDREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the\nastounded SCIENTISTS.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat happened -- ?\n\nDREIBERG\nHe saved himself.  He changed the past.\n\nLAURIE\nWhere did he go?\n\nBefore DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to\nTHROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For\na moment everything's back to normal --\n\n-- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they're in begins to\nDISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.\n\nA sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around\nthem, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge\ninto . . .\n\n241. EXT. VORTEX EFFECT\nDREIBERG, LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an\notherdimensional funhouse of sound and color.  If space and time\ncould be compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride, this\nwould be it.  Their bodies contract and distend, warp and elongate;\ntheir tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks; and then, before they\nknow it, they find themselves deposited --\n\n242. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT\n-- smack in the middle of a busy intersection.  The three of them\nmaterialize from nowhere; a southbound VAN swerves to avoid them,\nslamming into a row of parked cars, and a northbound TAXICAB does the\nsame, knocking over a fire hydrant.\n\nLAURIE\nDan, is this -- is this New York??\n\nDREIBERG\nThose cars.  What year is this??\n\nLAURIE\nEverything's changed --\n\nIt's a disorienting world they've landed in.  In fact, it's\nour world, our New York, and everything -- the cars,\nthe clothing, the very look of the city -- seems just a trifle out of\nwhack . . .\n\nRORSCHACH\nHnrrrrr -- we never happened.\n\nBYSTANDERS cluster about, laughing and taunting, highly amused by the\nobvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst.  There are, of\ncourse, no costumed heroes in our world, and their sudden\npresence prompts a Babel of speculation among the onlookers:\nNuts?  Fruits?  Out-of-work actors?\n\nRORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious, who gets a touch too\nclose, and the mood begins to turn hostile.  The CROWD, now grown to\nseveral dozen people, is threatening to block the intersection\naltogether; a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a\nshrill WHISTLE.\n\nDREIBERG\nOh my God, they still ride around on horses!\n\n243. EXT. NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT\nThe same newsstand we've seen all along -- but luckily, here in our\nworld, the headlines are only mildly discouraging: \"RUSSIAN SUMMIT\nTALKS COLLAPSE.\"  Like everyone else, our old friend the NEWS VENDOR\nis gapin at the ruckus on the street.\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nJesus Christ, it must be Halloween.\n\nHis sidekick, the small black KID who reads comic books, points to\nthe befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition.\n\nKID\nShit, man!  It's Rorschach!  And Night Owl!\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nWhat are you talkin' about?\n\nKID\nSuperheroes!  Check it out!\n\nHe thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDOR's hand and races off to\njoin the growing throng of rubberneckers.  The NEWS VENDOR stares\ndown at the costumed characters in the comic book -- \"WATCHMEN\" --\nthen throws a cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the\nstreet.\n\nKID\nAll right!  They must be on a case.\n\n244. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nHORNS BLARE.  ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.  The intersection is mobbed\nwith curious ONLOOKERS.  By now a half-dozen BEAT COPS have arrived\nto clear the streets and restore order.\n\nCOP I\nBreak it up!  Stand back!\n\nCOP II\nCome on, you three.  If this is some kind of publicity stunt --\n\nDREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH have fallen into a tight circle.\nThey don't know what to expect and they're poised for a brawl.  The\ntaunting crowd gives them plenty of room; even the COPS are hesitant\nto advance.\n\nLAURIE\nDan -- what do we do now?\n\nDREIBERG\n(panicked)\nWherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --\n\nLAURIE\nWe'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't\nthey -- ?\n\nRORSCHACH\nThey'd better.\n\nAnd on RORSCHACH's final vicious HISS, we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nTHE END1Embed"

I should've never come to this\nSo holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done\nI'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'\nAnd I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way\nSo tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready\nAnd I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low\nYo, I'll be over here\n\n[Chorus]\nOh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here\nOh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?\nOh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here\nAnd I can't wait till we can break up out of here406Embed"

There goes the dreams we used to say\n(Oops!) There goes the time we spent away\n(Oops!) There goes the love I had\nBut you cheated on me and that's for that now\n(Oops!) There goes the house we've made a home\n(Oops!) There goes \"You'll never leave me alone\"\n(Oops!) For all the lies you told\nThis is what you're owed\n\n[Chorus]\nHey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild\nJust go back and hit 'em up style\nGet your hands on his cash and\nSpend it to the last dime for all the hard times\nOh, when you go, then everything goes\nFrom the crib to the ride and the clothes\nSo you better let 'em know that\nIf he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Get your hands on his cash and)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhile he was braggin'\nI was coming down the hill just draggin'\nAll his pictures and his clothes in a bag and\nSold everything else 'til there was just nothing left\nAnd I paid, all the bills about a month too late\nIt's a shame we have to play these games\nThe love we had just fade away, away\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\n(Oops!)

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.
