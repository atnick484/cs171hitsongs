Mike Shinoda]\nYeah, here we go for the hundredth time\nHand grenade pins in every line\nThrow 'em up and let something shine\nGoing out of my fucking mind\nFilthy mouth, no excuse\nFind a new place to hang this noose\nString me up from atop these roofs\nKnot it tight so I won't get loose\nTruth is, you can stop and stare\nBled myself out and no one cares\nDug the trench out, laid down there\nWith a shovel up out of reach, somewhere\nYeah, someone pour it in\nMake it a dirt dance floor, again\nSay your prayers and stomp it out\nWhen they bring that chorus in\n[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]\nI bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away\nI bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away\nI bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away\nJust to throw it away, just to throw it away\nI bleed it out\n\n[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]\nGo, stop the show\nChoppy words and a sloppy flow\nShotgun opera, lock and load\nCock it back and then watch it go\nMama, help me, I've been cursed\nDeath is rolling in every verse\nCandy paint on his brand new hearse\nCan't contain him, he knows he works\nFuck, this hurts, I won't lie\nDoesn't matter how hard I try\nHalf the words don't mean a thing\nAnd I know that I won't be satisfied\nSo why try ignoring him?\nMake it a dirt dance floor again\nSay your prayers and stomp it out\nWhen they bring that chorus in\n\n[Chorus: Chester Bennington]\nI bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away\nI bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away\nI bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it

lies in the books\nTo make a citizen out of you\nBecause they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you, son\nSo they can watch all the things you do\nBecause the drugs never work, they're gonna give you a smirk\n'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean\nThey're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds\nAnother cog in the murder machine\n\n[Chorus]\nThey said, \"All teenagers scare the living shit out of me\nThey could care less as long as someone'll bleed\"\nSo darken your clothes or strike a violent pose\nMaybe they'll leave you alone, but not me\n[Verse 2]\nThe boys and girls in the clique, the awful names that they stick\nYou're never gonna fit in much, kid\nBut if you're troubled and hurt, what you got under your shirt\nWill make them pay for the things that they did\n\n[Chorus]\nThey said, \"All teenagers scare the living shit out of me\nThey could care less as long as someone'll bleed\"\nSo darken your clothes or strike a violent pose\nMaybe they'll leave you alone, but not me, oh, yeah\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nThey said, \"All teenagers scare the living shit out of me\nThey could care less as long as someone'll bleed\"\nSo darken your clothes or strike a violent pose\nMaybe they'll leave you alone, but not me\nAll together now\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Teenagers scare the living shit out of me\nThey could care less as long as someone'll bleed\"\nSo darken your clothes or strike a violent pose\nMaybe they'll leave you alone, but not me\n\"Teenagers scare the living shit out of me\nThey could care less as long as someone'll bleed\"\nSo darken your

throw it up in the sky\nLet it come down slow watch it all fly\nFront to the back then side to the side\nThen we head back to my crib for the night\nThat's how it goes down, all night long\nShe whisper in my ear says she loves my song\nThis Is Why I'm Hot, she got it on her phone\nTop ten download number one ring tone\nI'm in my zone tell me what's good, what it be\nCan't say I'm what you

the waist\nI'm a baller, baby I'll hold us safe\nI got about ten lawyers to blow the case\nSo we don't gotta worry 'bout those who hate\nI'm like the 2-0-0-7 Nino\nDropped a few G's on my shirt like Gino\nHomey don't act like you know what I mean\nOh see I'm the freshest motherfucker on the scene though\nBack of the club, all night long\nGrand Monea pop a Case Of The Dom\nShorty says she love it when I let her call me Sean\nSo if you really down baby we can get it on\nYou might also like[Hook] [*Female's Voice]\nLike this, Like this, Like this, Like this, Like this, Like this, Like

covered in lead based paint\nNo child proof lids, no seat belts in cars\nRode bikes with no helmets and still here we are, still here we are\nWe got daddy's belt when we misbehaved\nHad three TV channels you got up to change\nNo video games and no satellite\nAll we had were friends and they were outside, playin' outside\n\nChorus\nIt was a different life\nWhen we were boys and girls\nNot just a different time\nIt was a different world\nSchool always started the same every day\nThe pledge of allegiance then someone would pray\nNot every kid made the team when they tried\nWe got disappointed and that was all right, we turned out all right\n\nChorus\n\nBridge\nNo bottled water, we drank from a garden hose\nAnd every Sunday, all the stores were closed\nChorus\nChorus\nIt was a different

Will he die? Guess he might luck up\nMeanwhile, I'm racing my Ferrari like a light for a buck\nAgainst Lamborghini Gallardos every time I get a car\n\n[Hook]\nI like my beat down low and my top let back\nCan see

spin, colliding into sound\nLike whales beneath me diving down\nI'm sinking to the bottom of my\nEverything that freaks me out\nThe lighthouse beam has just run out\nI'm cold as cold as cold can be\nBe\n[Chrous]\nI want to swim away but don't know how\nSometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean\nLet the waves up take me down\nLet the hurricane set in motion, yeah\nLet the rain of what I feel right now come down\nLet the rain come down\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhere is the coastguard?\nI keep looking each direction\nFor a spotlight, give me something\nI need something for protection\nMaybe flotsam junk will do just fine\nThe jetsam sunk, I'm left behind\nI'm treading for my life believe me\n(How can I keep up this breathing?)\nNot knowing how to think\nI scream aloud, begin to sink\nMy legs and arms are broken down\nWith envy for the solid ground\nI'm reaching for the life within me\nHow can one man stop his ending?\nI thought of just your face\nRelaxed, and

done\nLike jumping from the bow, yeah\nJust to prove that I knew how, yeah\nIt's midnight's late reminder of\nThe loss of her, the one I love\nMy will to quickly end it all\nSet front row in my need

orange drink covered his lap\nWell then my four year old said a four letter word\nThat started with \"S\" and I was concerned\nSo I said, \"Son now where did you learn to talk like that?\"\n[Chorus]\nHe said \"I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool?\nI'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you\nAnd eat all my food and grow as tall as you are\nWe got cowboy boots and camo

hard\nSaid, \"Lord please help me help my stupid self\"\nThen this side of bedtime later that night\nTurning on my son's Scooby Doo nightlight\nHe crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees\nHe closed his little eyes, folded his little hands\nAnd spoke to God like he was talking to a friend\nAnd I said, \"Son now where'd you learn to pray like that?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nHe said \"I've been

me wanna change\nI like the way you dance and the way you play the game\nI like the way you take away the pain\nThe way you tell me that you want it, not saying a thing\nThe way you got me going got

know they're all thinking I'm so white and nerdy\nThink I'm just too white and nerdy\nThink I'm just too white and nerdy\nCan't you see I'm white and nerdy?\nLook at me, I'm white and nerdy\nI wanna roll with the gangstas\nBut so far they all think I'm too white and nerdy\nThink I'm just too white and nerdy\nThink I'm just too white and nerdy\nI'm just too white and nerdy\nReally, really white and nerdy\n[Verse 1]\nFirst in my class here at MIT\nGot skills, I'm a champion at D&D\nM.C. Escher\u2014that's my favorite \"M.C.\"\nKeep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea\nMy rims never spin, to the contrary\nYou'll find that they're quite stationary\nAll of my action figures are cherry\nStephen Hawking's in my library\nMy MySpace page is all totally pimped out\nGot people beggin' for my Top 8 spaces\nYo, I know pi to a thousand places\nAin't got no grills, but I still wear braces\nI order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise\nI'm a whiz at Minesweeper\u2014I could play for days\nOnce you see my sweet moves, you're gonna stay amazed\nMy fingers movin' so fast I'll set the place ablaze\nThere's no killer app I haven't run (Run)\nAt Pascal, well, I'm number one (One)\nDo vector calculus just for fun\nI ain't got a gat but I got a soldering gun (What?)\n\"Happy Days\" is my favorite theme song\nI could sure kick your butt in a game of ping pong\nI'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on\nI'm fluent in JavaScript as well as Klingon\nHere's the part I sing on\nSee

nerdy\nThink I'm just too white and nerdy\nThink I'm just too white and nerdy\nI'm just too white and nerdy\nHow'd I get so white and nerdy?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've been browsin', inspectin'\nX-Men comics, you know I collect 'em\nThe pens in my pocket, I must protect 'em\nMy ergonomic keyboard never leaves me bored\nShopping online for deals on some writable media\nI edit Wikipedia\nI memorized Holy Grail really well\nI can recite it right now and have you \"ROTFLOL\"\nI got a business doing websites\nWhen my friends need some code, who do they call?\nI do HTML for 'em all\nEven made a homepage for my dog, yo\nI got myself a fanny pack\nThey were havin' a sale down at The Gap\nSpend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap\nPop, pop, hope no one sees me, gettin' freaky\nI'm nerdy in the extreme and whiter than sour cream\nI was in AV Club and Glee Club and even the Chess Team\nOnly question I ever thought was hard\nWas do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?\nSpend every weekend at the Renaissance Fair\nGot my name on my underwear\n[Chorus]\nThey see me strollin', they laughin'\nAnd rollin' their eyes 'cause I'm so white and nerdy\nJust because I'm white and nerdy\nJust because I'm white and nerdy\nAll because I'm white and nerdy\nHoly cow, I'm white and nerdy!\nI wanna bowl with the gangstas\nBut, oh well, it's obvious I'm white and nerdy\nThink I'm just too white and nerdy\nThink I'm just too white and nerdy\nI'm just too white and nerdy\nLook at me, I'm white and nerdy17Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1687774",

beautiful baby from the outside in\nChase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again\nGo on, take on this whole world\nBut to me you know you'll always be, my little girl\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you were in trouble, that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone\nNow look at you, I've turned around and you've almost grown\nSometimes you're asleep I whisper \"I Love You!\" in the moonlight at your door\nAs I walk away, I hear you say, \"Daddy Love You More!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're beautiful baby from the outside in\nChase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again\nGo on, take on this whole world\nBut to me you know you'll always be, my little girl\n\n[Verse 3]\nSomeday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand\nBut I won't say \"yes\" to him unless I know, he's the half\nThat makes you whole, he has a poet's soul, and the heart of a man's man\nI know he'll say that he's in love\nBut between you and me, he won't be good

in love your alone in this place\nLike there's nobody else in the world\nI was enough for her not long ago\nI was her number one, she told me so\nAnd she still means the world to me\nJust so you know\nSo be careful when you hold my girl\nTime changes everything\nLife must go on\nAnd I'm not going to stand in your way\n[Chorus]\nBut I loved her first, I held her first\nAnd a place in my heart will always be hers\nFrom the first breath she breathed\nWhen she first smiled at me\nI knew the love of a father runs deep\nAnd I prayed that she'd find you someday\nBut it still hard to give her away\nI loved her first\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow could that beautiful woman with you\nBe the same freckle face kid that I knew\nThe one that I read all those fairy tales to\nAnd tucked into bed all those nights\nAnd I knew the first time I saw you with her\nIt was only a matter of time\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I loved her first and I held her first\nAnd a place in my heart will always be hers\nFrom the first

want somebody to give my little girl the game\nWhen she done found her S.E.X\n\n[Verse 1: Lyfe Jennings]\nLife's a trip\nHeard you just turned 17 and finally got some hips\nHustlers on the block go crazy when you lick yo' lips\nBut they just want relation, they don't want relationships\n(welcome to the real world)\nIt ain't the same\nFellas old enough to be yo' daddy know ya' name\nEverybody's talkin' 'bout how much that girl done changed\nCan't quite put ya' finger on it, but you feelin' strange\nLike it's fire in your veins\n[Chorus: Lala Brown]\nGirl it's just your\nS.E.X\nMama's secret,

attitude and Prada holla back\nMomma's givin' advice but she ain't tryna hear that\nNot because it's wrong, just her delivery is wack\n(Shay get ya behind in this house, if I see you with another boy, I swear)\nLife is rough\nYou say that you're not ready for sex, but you're in love\nHe says if you really loved him, you would give it up\nMomma says that's just a line guys use to get yo' stuff\nWhich one will you trust?\n\n[Chorus: Lala Brown]\nGirl it's just your\nS.E.X\nMama's secret, and daddy gone go crazy when he finds out that his baby's found her\nS.E.X\nTake a deep breath, and

haunt you anymore\nWhere the brave are free and lovers soar\nCome ride with me to the distant shore\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nWe won't hesitate\nTo break down the garden gate\nThere's not much time left today,

kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly\nAsks if I'm gonna be out late\nI say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls\nA lie I didn't have to tell\nBecause we both know where I'm about to go\nAnd we know it very well\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful\nAnd it kills him inside\nTo know that I am happy with some other guy\nI can see him dying\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't wanna do
