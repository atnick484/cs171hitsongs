long)\nI just found out there's something wrong\n(Something is wrong)\nNothing will get better if I stay\nThere's no need to explain anymore\nI tried my best to love you\nNow I'm walkin' out the door\n(Walking out the door)\nYou used me, you've deceived me\n(What you trying to do to me?)\nAnd you never seem to need me\nBut I'll bet, you won't forget me when I go\n(Oh no, no, no)\n[Chorus]\nSeems I've been lost in a dream\nPretending that you care\nAnd now I've opened up my eyes\nAnd found it's all been just a great big fairytale\nI've been lovin' you so long\n(My love's so strong)\nDon't think I'll even know how to forget you\n(I can't forget you)\nBut now the way that things have been\nI think I'm better off alone\nThan to be with you\nYou don't love me, it's plain to see\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou played around, you broke my heart\nTold me we would never part\nBut that wasn't true\nSo what else can I do but move on\n\n[Instrumental break]\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been loving you so long\n(My love's so strong)\nDon't think I'll even know how to forget you\n(I can't forget you)\nBut now the way that things have been\nI think I'm better of alone\nThan to be with you\nYou don't love me, it's plain to see\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nThere's no need to explain anymore\nI tried my best to love you\nNow I'm walkin' out the door\n(Walking out the door)\nOh, you used me, you deceived me\n(What you trying to do to me?)\nAnd you never seem to need me\nBut I'll bet, you won't forget me when I go\n(Oh no, no, no)\n\n[Chorus]\nSeems I've been lost in a dream\nPretending that you mine\nSomeday you'll open up your eyes\nAnd realize that a good woman's hard to find\nYes, I've been lost in a dream\nPretending that you care\nAnd now I've opened up my eyes\nAnd found it's all been just a great big fairytale\n\n[Outro]\n(I moved on)\nMove on, got to move on\nMove on, got to move on\nMove on, got to move on\nMove on, got to move on\nMove on\nHit it, Nellie\nI've got to move onEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/1192731", "artist_names": "Tavares", "full_title": "She's Gone by\u00a0Tavares", "header_image_thumbnail_url":

sky\nAnd ten days on the road are barely gone\nThere's a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove\nIt's the light in your eyes that makes him warm\n[Chorus]\nHey, it's good to be back home again\nSometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend\nYes, and hey, it's good to be back home again\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere's all the news to tell him, how'd you spend your time\nWhat's the latest thing the neighbors say\nAnd your mother called last Friday, sunshine made her cry\nYou felt the baby move just yesterday\n\n[Chorus]\nHey, it's good to be back home again, yes it is\nSometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend\nYes, and hey, it's good to be back home again\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd all the time that I can lay this tired, old body down\nTo feel your fingers feather soft upon me\nThe kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way\nThe happiness that living with you brings me\n\n[Verse 4]\nIt's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you\nIt's the little things that make a house a home\nLike a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove\nThe light in your eyes that makes me warm\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nHey, it's good to be back home

just that feeling man\n\n[Verse 1: James Craig]\nOctober to me seems like a memory\nThe Girls on tumblr tellin me they in love with me\nYeah\nExcept a few girls from the city tho\nThey misguided\nThey always lying\nCould Never tell me the truth\nLike who she sleeping with too\nSaying I would have a chance\nBut I end up getting used\nAnd\nI got used to it\nSo anything she told me I wasn't new to it\nI would just adapt to it\nPut on a mask like I'm Jim Carey I would just act through it\nSometimes I had to tweet through it\nSome nights I had the henny bottle I would drink through it\nFeeling ran deep into my heart like a cavity\nActually\nI felt so disconnected from reality\nStuck in this me and you fantasy\nWhy can I not be with you\nAfter all the things you put me through\n[Hook : James Craig]\nOctober to me\nOctober to me seems like a memory\nYeah\nOctober to me\nOctober to me\nSeems like a memory\n\n[Verse 2 : James Craig ]\nI should  listen to friends more\nBut It's too many drinks being poured\nRight now\nI remember one time I was 38 points in the friend zone\nI should've packed up like Lebron and just went home\nMan\nI was confused and couldn't let go\nLearned the hard way some of these women are just cutthroat\nWe can talk later I just need to get my mixing on\nI just to need to reminisce with some in scents on\nI just need to let the Tea burn one time\nI just need to let the Tea burn one time\nSo I can match the beat with the tears in my eyes\nHad to realize that she was full of lies\nShe probably staring at her phone\nWondering why I won't reply [x3]\nI told her to Take Care\nCause Nothing was the same\nI am So Far Gone\nIf You're Reading This It's Too Late\nI needed Room For Improvement\nOn my Comeback Season\nI wouldn't let go but she gave me a reason\nLeft me on this microphone heart still bleeding\nEar waiting for the phone my subconscious can  still hear it ringing\nYou might also like[Hook]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count":

1]\nThe fortune queen of New Orleans\nWas brushing her cat in her black limousine\nOn the back seat were scratches from\nThe marks of men, her fortune she had won\nI couldn't see through the tinted glass;\nShe said, \"Home, James\" and he hit the gas\nI followed her to some darkened room\nShe took my money, she said, \"I'll be with you soon\"\n\n[Chorus]\nDark lady laughed and danced\nAnd lit the candles one by one;\nDanced to her gypsy music\n'Till her brew was done...\nDark lady played black magic\n'Till the clock struck on the twelve\nShe told me more about me\nThan I knew myself...\n[Verse 2]\nShe dealt two cards, a queen and a three\nAnd mumbled some words that were so strange to me\nAnd then she turned up a two-eyed jack\nMy eyes saw red but the card still stayed black\nShe said, \"The man you love is secretly true\nTo someone else who is very close to you!\nMy advice is that you leave this place\nNever come back, and forget you ever saw my face!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nDark lady laughed and danced\nAnd lit the candles one by one;\nDanced to her gypsy music\nTill her brew was done...\nDark lady played black magic\nTill the clock struck on the twelve\nShe told me more about me\nThan I knew myself...\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo I ran home and crawled in my bed\nI couldn't sleep because of all the things she said\nThen I remembered her strange perfume\nAnd how I smelled it once in my own room\nSo I snuck back and caught her with my man;\nLaughing and kissing til they saw the gun in my hand...\nThe next thing I knew they were dead on the floor--\nDark Lady would never turn a card up anymore!\nYou might also like[Chorus fades out]\nDark lady laughed and danced\nAnd lit the candles one by one;\nDanced to her gypsy music\nTil her brew

Jo\nNow she's got rings on her fingers\nAnd bells on her toes\nSay has anybody seen my sweet Gypsy Rose\nOh, I got wind my Jo's been dancing here in New Orleans\nIn this smoke-filled honky-tonk\nThey call the land of dreams\nOh, here she comes a strutting in her birthday clothes\nSay has anybody seen my sweet Gypsy Rose\n\nOh baby, baby, won't you come home\nSay we all miss you\nAnd every night we kiss your picture\n\nOh Rose, one night\nThe lights go dim and the crowd goes home\nThat's the day you wake up and you find you're all alone\nSo let's say good-bye to Gypsy, hello Mary Jo\nSay has

run still\nAnd the four winds we know blow away\nNow he walks down the street in the evenin\nAnd he stops by the old candy store\nAnd I somehow believe hes believin\nHes holdin er hand like before\nFor he feels all her love walkin with him\nAnd he smiles at the things she might say\nThen the old man walks up to the hilltop\nAnd gives her a daisy a day\nIll give you a daisy a day,

you\nDial in the number who's bound to love you\n\n[Chorus 1]\nOh honey, you turn me on, I'm a radio\nI'm a country station, I'm a little bit corny\nI'm a wildwood flower waving for you\nI'm a broadcasting tower waving for you\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I'm sending you out this signal here\nI hope you can pick it up loud and clear\n[Chorus 2]\nI know you don't like weak women, you get bored so quick\nAnd you don't like strong women 'cause they're hip to your tricks\nIt's been dirty for dirty down the line\nBut you know I come when you whistle when you're loving and kind\n\n[Verse 3]\nBut if you've got too many doubts\nIf there's no good reception for me then tune me out\n\n[Chorus 3]\n'Cause honey, who needs the static, it hurts the head\nAnd you wind up cracking and the day goes dismal\nFrom \"Breakfast Barney\" to the sign-off prayer\nWhat a sorry face you get to wear\nI'm going to tell you again now if you're still listening there\n\n[Outro]\nIf you're driving into town with a dark cloud above you\nDial in the number who's bound to love you\nIf you're lying on the beach with the transistor going\nKick off the sandflies, honey, the love's still flowing\nIf your head says forget it but your heart's still smoking\nCall me at the station, the lines are openYou might also like1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/624326",

trains that have no names\nFreight yards full of old black men\nAnd the graveyards of the rusted automobiles\nGood morning America how are you?\nSo Don't you know me I'm your native son\nI'm the train they call The City of New Orleans\nI'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done\n\nDealin' cards with the old men in the club car\nPenny a point ain't no one keepin' score\nWon't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle\nFeel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor\nAnd the sons of Pullman porters\nAnd the sons of engineers\nRide their fathers' magic carpets made of steel\nMothers with their babes asleep\nAre rockin' to the gentle beat\nAnd the rhythm of the rails is all they feel\n\nGood morning America how are you?\nDon't you know me I'm your native son\nI'm the train they call The City of New Orleans\nI'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done\n\nNighttime on The City of New Orleans\nChanging cars in Memphis, Tennessee\nHalf way home, we'll be there by morning\nThrough the Mississippi darkness\nRolling down to the sea\nAnd all the towns and people seem\nTo fade into a bad dream\nAnd the steel rails still ain't heard the news\nThe conductor sings his songs again\nThe passengers will please refrain\nThis train's got the disappearing railroad blues\nYou might also likeGood night, America, how are you?\nDon't you know me I'm your native son\nI'm the

round\"\nShe serves them whiskey and wine\n[Chorus 1]\nThe sailors say, \"Brandy, you're a fine girl\n(You're a fine girl)\nWhat a good wife you would be\n(Such a fine girl)\nYeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nBrandy wears a braided chain\nMade of finest silver from the north of Spain\nA locket that bears the name\nOf a man that Brandy loved\n\n[Verse 4]\nHe came on a summer's day\nBringing gifts from far away\nBut he made it clear he couldn't stay\nNo harbor was his home\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThe sailor said, \"Brandy, you're a fine girl\n(You're a fine girl)\nWhat

close down\nBrandy walks through a silent town\nAnd loves a man who's not around\nShe still can hear him say\n\n[Outro]\nShe hears him say, \"Brandy, you're a fine girl\n(You're a fine girl)\nWhat a

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIt was raining hard in Frisco\nI needed one more fare to make my night\nA lady up ahead waved to flag me down\nShe got in at the light\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, where you going to, my lady blue\nIt's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain\nShe just looked out the window\nShe said, \"Sixteen Parkside Lane\"\n[Verse 3]\nSomething about her was familiar\nI could swear I seen her face before\nBut she said, \"I'm sure you're mistaken\"\nAnd she didn't say anything more\n\n[Verse 4]\nIt took a while, but she looked in the mirror\nThen she glanced at the license for my name\nA smile seemed to come to her slowly\nIt was a sad smile just the same\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd she said, \"How are you, Harry?\"\nI said, \"How are you, Sue?\nThrough the too many miles and the too little smiles\nI still remember you\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nIt was somewhere in a fairy tale\nI used to take her home in my car\nWe learned about love in the back of a Dodge\nThe lesson hadn't gone too far\n\n[Chorus]\nYou see, she was gonna be an actress\nAnd I was gonna learn to fly\nShe took off to find the footlights\nI took off to find the sky\nYou might also like[Post-Chorus]\nOh, I've got something inside me\nTo drive a princess blind\nThere's a wild man wizard\nHe's hiding in me, illuminating my mind\nOh, I've got something inside me\nNot what my life's about\n'Cause I've been letting my outside tide me\nOver 'til my time (Over 'til my time) runs out\n\n[Bridge]\nBaby's so high that she's skying\nYes she's flying, afraid to fall\nI'll tell you why baby's crying\n'Cause she's dying, aren't we all?\n\n[Verse 6]\nThere was not much more for us to talk about\nWhatever we had once was gone\nSo I turned my cab into the driveway\nPast the gate and the fine-trimmed lawns\n\n[Verse 7]\nAnd she said, \"We must get together\"\nBut I knew it'd never be arranged\nThen she hand me twenty dollars for a two-fifty fare\nShe said, \"Harry, keep the change\"\n[Verse 8]\nWell, another man might have been angry\nAnd another man might have been hurt\nBut another man never would have let her go\nI stashed the bill in my shirt\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd she walked away in silence\nIt's strange how you never know\nBut we'd both gotten what we'd asked for\nSuch a long, long time ago\n\n[Verse 9]\nYou see, she was gonna be an actress\nAnd I was gonna learn to fly\nShe took off to find the footlights\nI took off for the sky\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd here she's acting happy\nInside her handsome home\nAnd me, I'm flying in my taxi\nTaking tips and getting stoned\nI go flying so high when I'm stoned3Embed"},

The \"Craig\" puppet paces back and forth,\nwringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig,\nabove and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet.\nHis fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into\na dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the\npuppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one\nwould think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on\nthe real Craig's brow. His fingers move like lightning. The\npuppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's\nbrow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special\ndevice that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet\ncollapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to\nits face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down\naround the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches\noff the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT.

Nyong-nyong.\n\nCRAIG\nGimmicky bastard.\n\nCraig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a\nfemale puppeteer to teach at a girls school.

Well, it is not my fault that\nthou art tiny. So if it is charity\nyer after, then be gone with ye,\nye foul demon.\n\nTINY WOMAN\nI am not asking for alms, but rather\nthe ear of a kind man with a noble\nheart.\n\nMERTIN\n(sighs)\nAye. Speak then if ye must.\n\nTINY WOMAN\nCaptain Mertin, surely I am a\nGod-fearing Christian woman like\nyourself, but alas, I am afraid that\nthe world was not built with me in\nmind. Door knobs are too high, chairs\nare unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms\nmock my stature.

Maxine slips her arm\nthrough Craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances\ntriumphantly over at Lotte.\n\nMAXINE\nNow excuse us, we have an\nentertainment legend to create.\n\nLESTER\n(to the cult members)\nClear the way for them, my friends.\nThey will be dealt with in due time.\n\nThe Malkovichians grumble and let Malkovich and Maxine\nexit.\n\nLESTER (CONT'D)\nNow, let's see what we can do to\nsalvage this portal... for the sake\nof all that is good.\n\nThe Malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and\nbegin clawing desperately at the quick-drying cement.\nFingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and\nskin on the rough gray surface.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nA slick-looking agent answers a buzzing phone.\n\nAGENT\nOf course, send him right in. Don't\never keep him waiting again. Do you\nunderstand?\n\nMalkovich and Maxine enter. The agent stands, holds out\nhis hand.\n\nAGENT (CONT'D)\nJohn! Great to see you! Sorry about\nthe cunt at reception.\n\nMALKOVICH\nThis is my fiancee Maxine.\n\nThe agent shakes Maxine's hand.\n\nAGENT\nGreat to see you, Maxine. Sorry about\nthe cunt at reception.

Can you arrange that?\n\nAGENT\nSure, sure. Just let me make a\ncouple of calls.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nThe cult members are still there, now with picks\nshovels. They are worn out and sweaty. The portal is\nexcavated, but it seems ragged and destroyed. Man #2\nemerges from the hole, a rope tied around his waist.\n\nMAN #2\nThat's the last of it, boss.\n\nLester peers through the door.\n\nLESTER\nWell, let's see what we've got\nhere.\n\nLester crawls into the tunnel, the door slams behind\nhim.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PORTAL - CONTINUOUS\n\nLester crawls through. There is a slurping sound and a\nflash of light.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BUNKER - DAY\n\nThe scene is in black and white. Bombs are dropping.\nThere is a blonde in forties clothes there. Lester\nviews the scene through somebody's POV.\n\nLESTER (V.O.)\nMy God, where am I? This seems so\nfamiliar.\n\nThe person walks past a mirror. It's Hitler.\n\nLESTER (V.O.)\nMy God, I'm Hitler in the bunker!\nAaaahhhh! Aaaah!\n\nDIRECTOR\nCut!\n\nWe look over to see a director and camera crew.\n\nLESTER (V.O.)\nOh, I'm just the actor in that\nTwilight Zone episode.\n\nThere is a popping sound.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. DITCH - DAY\n\nLester pops into the ditch. One of his cult members is\nwaiting with a car, and looking hopeful. Lester sadly\nshakes his head \"no.\"\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - DAY\n\nThe cult members mill about, drinking coffee, chatting.\nLester enters with the cult member who picked him up at\nthe ditch. All quiet down and look over at him.\n\nLESTER\nThank you all for your efforts,\nbut I'm afraid we can no longer get\ninto Malkovich through the portal.\n\nLOTTE\n(panicky)\nWhy not? I need to get in there!\n\nLESTER\nI'm not certain, my dear, but I\nbelieve your husband has somehow\npsychically diverted the route.\n\nLOTTE\nThat bastard! I'll gladly dispose\nof him in the name of the order, Son\nof Malkovich.\n\nLESTER\nI'm afraid that no physical harm\nmust come to him as long as he\ninhabits the vessel.\n\nMAN #3\n(raises hand)\nOooh, I got an idea! What if we\nbuild another portal to Malkovich,\nlike around back, and sneak in that\nway?\n\nMAN #4\nOnly Captain Mertin knew how to build\na portal, dummy, and he's dead!\n\nLESTER\nActually, my friends, I suppose its\ntime I told you, I'm Captain James\nMertin.\n\nThe members fall into a stunned silence. Lester takes\nsome refrigerator magnets and spells out L-E-S-T-E-R on\na board. He then rearranges them for a while.\n\nLESTER (CONT'D)\nYou see, Lester is an anagram for\nMertin.\n\nLester continues to rearrange the letters, getting a little\ntense now.\n\nLESTER (CONT'D)\nIt used to work, I'm sure of it.\n\nSeveral members check their watches.\n\nLESTER (CONT'D)\nOh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.\n\nL-E-S-T-E-R has been left as E-L R-E-S-T as Lester turns\nfrom the board to face the congregation.\n\nMAN #3\nHow can this be? I thought you were\nonly one hundred and five years old.\nMertin would have to be...\n\nLESTER\n(chuckles amiably)\nI'm two hundred and five, truth be\ntold.\n\nWOMAN #1\n(flirtatiously)\nYou don't look a day over one\nhundred and five, Captain. What's\nyour secret?\n\nLESTER\nLots of carrot juice, little lady.\nThat, and a deal with the Devil.\n\nThere is a lot of murmuring in the room now.\n\nMAN #2\nSo what exactly are you saying? Are\nwe in cahoots with the Dark Master\nhere?\n\nLESTER\nSurprise.\n\nThe cultists get tense, start to leave en masse.\n\nLESTER (CONT'D)\nWait! It's not that bad! When we get\ninto Malkovich, we still get to rule\nthe world, just like I told you. The\nonly difference is that we rule in the\nname of evil, instead of good.\n\nPeople stop in their tracks.\n\nMAN #3\nThat's the only difference?\n\nLESTER\nAbsolutely.\n\nThe cultists think about is, then shrug and stay put.\n\nLESTER (CONT'D)\nSo anyway...\n\nLotte stands.\n\nLOTTE\nWell, I for one, am resigning. I will\nnot serve evil. I am ashamed of all\nof you.\n\nLotte heads for the door.\n\nLESTER\nMy dear, let me assure you that when\nwe attain power, it will be much more\npleasant for those inside Malkovich,\nthan for those outside.\n\nLotte stops and turns.\n\nLOTTE\nI'll take my chances.\n\nShe exits.\n\nLESTER\nAnybody else?\n\nWOMAN #1\nDo we get to wear a crown?\n\nLESTER\nBut of course.\n\nWOMAN #1\nCount me in.\n\nLESTER\nGood. I think its time to beckon\nMr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us\nout of this pickle.\n\nFLIP TO:\n\nINT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - A BIT LATER\n\nMr. Flemmer, a silver-haired gentleman in turtleneck and\nblazer, scratches his head. The cultists patiently watch\nhim.\n\nFLEMMER\nBoy, this is a toughie. To be honest,\nI didn't anticipate this.\n\nLESTER\nAnd as I said, sir, we can't very\nwell exert physical persuasion upon\nthe sacred vessel Malkovich.\n\nFLEMMER\nRight, Lester. I heard you the first\ntime. I'm not a dummy.\n\nLESTER\nDidn't mean to imply that you were,\nsir.\n\nFLEMMER\nLook, I'm going back to my house\nto ponder this. So stay calm and\nkeep track of Schwartz's comings\nand goings. Oh, and somebody dispose\nof Schwartz's wife, will you?\n(to cultists)\nNice to meet you all.\n\nThe cult members ad-lib \"same here, sir.\"\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nLotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly\nsobbing. The caged animals watch her.\n\nLOTTE\nOh, my friends. Be thankful you're\nnot human. People are treacherous\nand greedy and corrupt. I've lost\nmy heart to two of them and I almost\nlost my soul to another. And I'm no\nbetter. Look at the way I keep you,\nlocked in cages, for my own enjoyment.\nWell, I've been in a cage too, my\nfriends. Literally and figuratively.\nSo tonight I set you free.\n\nLotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks\nall the cages. The animals scurry and fly out of their\ncages, and out of the house. Lotte watches silently until\nshe is alone.\n\nLOTTE (CONT'D)\nGood-bye, friends.\n\nA hand reaches for hers. She looks down. Elijah is still\nthere and holding her hand. She smiles.\n\nLOTTE (CONT'D)\nHello, friend\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT\n\nWe see the menagerie of animals on the otherwise deserted\nstreet, dispersing into the night. A lone dark figure turns\nthe corner, and walks slowly up the street to Craig and\nLotte's building.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\nLotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps.\nThe buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump.\n\nLOTTE\nThey've come to kill me, Elijah. See,\nI know too much. I should get the\ndoor. It's impolite to keep death\nwaiting.\n\nElijah looks at her sweetly, a great sadness in his eyes.\nThen he leads her by the hand out the window.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT\n\nThe marquee reads: World's Greatest Puppeteer Craig\nSchwartz and his Magical Puppet John Malkovich.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nMalkovich sits in a tuxedo and watches himself in the\ndressing table mirror. Maxine, in a tight black number,\nreclines on the couch.\n\nMAXINE\nThis is it, lover. You're stepping\nonto that stage a nobody and\npresto-change-o, you're coming\nback the greatest puppeteer the\nworld has ever seen.\n\nMALKOVICH\nI'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting\nme hard today.\n\nMalkovich jerks a bit, gets it under control.\n\nMAXINE\nDoesn't he know how important\ntonight is to us?\n\nMALKOVICH\nHe's a selfish bastard.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LAS VEGAS THEATER - NIGHT\n\nThe house is filling with formally dressed audience members.\nThe cultists and Lester, also in tuxes and gowns, are among\nthem. The lights go down.\n\nANNOUNCER (O.S.)\nLadies and gentlemen, it is the\ngreat privilege of the Luxor hotel\nand Casino to present Craig Schwartz\nand his magical puppet John\nMalkovich.\n\nThe orchestra starts up. The curtains part.\n\nLESTER\nBlasphemous bastard.\n\nMalkovich tap dances out onto the stage. He is amazingly\nnimble and the audience \"oohs\" and \"aahs.\"\n\nLESTER (CONT'D)\n(grudgingly)\nPretty good though.\n\nMalkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one\nknee and, with spread arms, begins singing: \"Kiss Today\nGoodbye.\" in a beautiful tenor. The orchestra catches up\nwith him. The audience goes wild. A pretty-boy young man\nwith a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit\nappears at the back of the house. An usher glances over at\nhim.\n\nUSHER\nOh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting\nyou tonight, sir. Um, I'm afraid\nthere's not an empty seat in the\nentire house.\n\nMANTINI\n(not taking his eyes from the stage)\nMake one empty.\n\nUSHER\nY-y-y-es sir.\n\nThe usher looks nervously around for someone to boot.\nMartini waits in the back. On stage, Malkovich is now\nperforming the \"back of the car scene\" from \"On The\nWaterfront.\" He alternates between the Marlon Brando part\nand the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one\nstool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see\nLester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye.\n\nLESTER\nNot too shabby.\n\nMantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a\nbeautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the\nexit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some\nconcern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and\nsmiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On\nstage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and\njuggling chainsaws.\n\nMANTINI\nNothing more than a Goddamn clown.\n\nAt this point the entire audience stands and gives Malkovich\na spontaneous standing ovation. All except Mantini. Even the\ncultists get up.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. SEWER - NIGHT\n\nLotte sits sadly in the wet tunnel. She is scrunched-up\nagainst the damp cold. A small fire smolders in front of\nher. We hear footsteps approaching. It is Elijah, carrying\nsupplies: food and blankets. He covers her with a blanket\nand sits down next to her.\n\nLOTTE\nThey're going to take over the\nworld, Elijah. Evil will reign.\nBut, then, evil already reigns,\ndoesn't it? So what difference\ndoes it make if John Malkovich\nis wearing the fucking crown while\nit's reigning?\n\nElijah sighs, then holds his stomach. The ulcer is\nreturning.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. FLEMMER'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nIt's a conservatively furnished upper westside apartment.\nLooks like it belongs to a Columbia professor. The walls\nare lined with books. Mr. Flemmer sits at his desk, his\nhead in his hands, deep in thought. The doorbell rings.\n\nFLEMMER\nIt's open.\n\nThe door opens and Lester pokes his head in.\n\nLESTER\nIt's just me, boss. I brought\ncroissants.\n\nLester enters with a greasy white paper bag.\n\nFLEMMER\nHave a seat. I wracking my brain\nover this Malkovich thing.\n\nLESTER\nWe saw his show at the Luxor last\nnight.\n\nFLEMMER\n(impressed)\nVegas? What'd you think?\n\nLESTER\nThe kid's got talent. You've never\nseen Malkovich like this. Schwartz\nhad him up there singing and dancing.\nImpressions.\n\nFLEMMER\nImpressions? Those are hard.\n\nLESTER\nVery talented son of a bitch. Too bad\nwe can't kill him.\n\nFLEMMER\nI suppose I could come to him in a\ndream. I don't know. That's the best\nI can think of right now.\n\nLESTER\nA scary dream?\n\nFLEMMER\nNo, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary\ndream.\n\nLESTER\n(noncommittally)\nI like that.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nMalkovich sits on the floor in silk pajamas. He is\nsurrounded by newspaper clippings. He is drinking\nchampagne from the bottle. Maxine is at a dressing\ntable, brushing her hair.\n\nMALKOVICH\nThey love me, darling! \"Craig Schwartz\nis fantastic!\" The New York Times.\n\"If only Craig Schwartz had always\nbeen inside Malkovich!\" Women's Wear\nDaily. \"Craig Schwartz - The world's\ngreatest puppeteer!\" Paul Wunder,\nWBAI Radio.\n\nMAXINE\nOh, darling. It's a dream come true.\nWe're going to ride this straight to\nthe top.\n\nMALKOVICH\nSleepy suddenly.\n\nMAXINE\nBusy day, my little fire chief. Why\ndon't you climb into bed, and I'll\nmeet you there in just...\n\nBut Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of\nhis clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts\nblanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. HELL - NIGHT\n\nCraig wanders across a jagged, rocky landscape. Geysers of\nflame shoot up around him. The sky is red. He is frightened.\nHe arrives at a desk. The man behind the desk is facing away\nfrom him. He swivels to face Craig. It is Flemmer, looking\nthe same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister\ngrin.\n\nCRAIG\nWho are you?\n\nFLEMMER\nI am the Devil.\n\nCRAIG\nOh.\n\nFLEMMER\nLeave Malkovich. He is mine.\n\nCRAIG\nOkay. Sorry. I didn't know.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS\n\nMalkovich awakes with a start. Maxine looks over at him.\n\nMAXINE\nBad dream, darling?\n\nMALKOVICH\nI've got to leave Malkovich.\n\nMAXINE\nYou've got to be kidding.\n\nMALKOVICH\nI just had the most horrifying\nnightmare. The devil was in it.\n\nFlemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. He is pleased\nwith himself.\n\nMAXINE\nMalkovich is our meal ticket. You\ncan't back out because of some\nstupid dream.\n\nFLEMMER\n(to himself)\nShit.\n\nMALKOVICH\nHoney, we can be happy and poor\ntogether.\n\nMAXINE\n(laughs derisively)\nPerhaps you'll want to consult that\nOuija board again.\n\nThere is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry.\n\nMAXINE (CONT'D)\nYeah what?!\n\nMALKOVICH\nDerek Mantini!\n\nMantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and\nMaxine give each other the once over.\n\nMANTINI\n(still eyeing Maxine)\nHello, Schwartz. I saw your show.\n\nMALKOVICH\nDid you see the reviews?\n\nMANTINI\nYeah, I saw them\n\nMALKOVICH\nBecause if you missed any, I just\nhappen to have copies here you can\ntake with you when you leave now.\n\nMAXINE\nI'm Maxine. I produced the evening\nwith Malkovich.\n\nMANTINI\nVery impressive. I could use a\nproducer with your vision. And\nother outstanding attributes.\n\nMALKOVICH\nShe's not available.\n\nMANTINI\nWe'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.\n\nMAXINE\nYeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.\n\nMANTINI\nI won't waste your time Schwartz, or\nmore importantly, mine. Here's my\nproposal: There's only room in this\nworld for one \"World's Greatest\nPuppeteer.\" Correct? So let's allow\nthe puppet-going public to crown\ntheir king.\n\nMALKOVICH\nHow do we do that?\n\nMANTINI\nA friendly competition, if you will.\nYour Malkovich puppet and my Harry S.\nTruman puppet appear opposite each\nother in a play. Not some Vegas\nBurly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play\nthat requires actual acting. The\naudience decides who is more deserving\nof the title. The losing puppeteer\nbows out graciously. Goes back to\nobscurity as a file clerk.\n\nMALKOVICH\nWhat's the play?\n\nMANTINI\nSay... \"Equus\"? It's got everything.\n\nMALKOVICH\nNever heard of it.\n\nMANTINI\nBroadway's finest three hours. It's\nabout the suppression of the\nindividual. Conformity as God in\nmodern society.\n\nMALKOVICH\nSounds boring. Are there any songs?\n\nMANTINI\nNothing but acting to hide behind,\nbuddy-boy.\n\nMALKOVICH\nI'm not afraid. I toured for a year\nwith the National Puppet Company's\nproduction of \"Long Day's Journey\nInto Night.\"\n\nMANTINI\nGreat then.\n\nMALKOVICH\nIs there dancing?\n\nMANTINI\nNo.\n\nMALKOVICH\nWho needs dancing?\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. FLEMMER'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nLester is watering Flemmer's plants. A key is heard in the\ndoor. Flemmer enters, a small carry-on bag slung over his\nshoulder.\n\nLESTER\nHow'd it go? Did you say the\nphilodendron gets water or no?\n\nFLEMMER\nNo, for God's sake, I just watered\nit yesterday.\n(beat)\nIt almost went well. I gave a pretty\ngood dream, but circumstances arose.\n\nLESTER\nWhat kind of circumstances?\n\nFLEMMER\nMaxine says she'll leave him if he\nleaves Malkovich, plus he's been\nchallenged to a puppet-duel by\nMantini.\n\nLESTER\nThe Great Mantini?\n\nFLEMMER\nNo, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course\nthe Great Mantini!\n\nLESTER\nOh, he's good! Great, actually. I\nsaw him do \"Tru\" with his sixty\nfoot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.\n\nFLEMMER\nBut I think I have another plan.\n\nLESTER\n(snippy)\nDo tell. I love a good plan.\n\nFLEMMER\nWhy are you being like this?\n\nLester shrugs.\n\nLESTER\nI missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me\nthe plan.\n\nFLEMMER\nWell, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will\nleave Malkovich, right? So, if he\nneeds it, I help Mantini's performance\na bit, give him an edge. Spice up the\nshow.\n\nLESTER\nCan you do that? I mean, do you know\nanything about puppetry?\n\nFLEMMER\nI am the Devil, Lester. I think I can\nhandle it.\n\nLESTER\nI was just asking. No disrespect\nintended.\n\nFLEMMER\nFine. Let's drop it.\n\nLESTER\nFine. I mean, it's not like I was\ndoubting you, it's just that I know\npuppetry is a skill that takes a long\ntime to acquire.\n\nFLEMMER\nFine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.\n\nLESTER\nFine.

BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT\n\nThe house is packed. On stage is a minimalist set: wood\nplanks and metal poles. Six guys in brown turtlenecks and\nstylized wire horse heads mill about. The 60 foot Harry S.\nTruman puppet is pacing, his strings extending up into the\nflyspace and out of sight. Malkovich sits on a bench. Truman\nand Malkovich both take stabs at British accents.\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET\nDo you dream often?\n\nMALKOVICH\nDo you?\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET\nIt's my job to ask the questions.\nYours to answer them.\n\nMALKOVICH\nSays who?\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET\nSays me.

I\nwept at the speech about your wife.\n\nFlemmer materializes behind Mantini\n\nCHARLES NELSON REILLY\nWhat the hell? Nyong-nyong!\n\nMantini spins around to face Flemmer. Reilly makes a break\nfor it. Flemmer points a finger and Reilly freezes in\nmid-strut. Flemmer then points a finger at Mantini, and he,\ntoo, freezes. Flemmer picks up the giant wooden controls\nfor the marionette, and pulls a copy of the play from his\npocket.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BROADHURST STAGE - NIGHT\n\nWe watch the second act in progress. The Truman puppet pace\nas he delivers a monologue. Somehow he doesn't even seem to\nbe a puppet anymore, so subtle and graceful are his\nmovements and the changes in his facial expressions. It's\nas if there's a giant actual Harry Truman on stage.\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET\nI can hear the creature's voice. It's\ncalling me out of the black cave of\nthe Psyche. I shove in my dim little\ntorch, and there he stands -- waiting\nfor me. He raises his matted head. He\nopens his great, square teeth and says\n(mocking)\n'Why? ... Why me? ... Why --\nultimately -- Me? ... Do you really\nimagine you can account for Me?\nTotally, infallibly, inevitably\naccount for Me? ...

Lie back. Just lie back!\nNow breathe in deep. Very deep. In ...\nOut ... In ... Out ... That's it ...\nIn. Out .. In ...

The audience is watching Malkovich.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER\n(to his wife)\nThat Malkovich puppet is a damn fine\nactor.\n\nFLEMMER\n(blood boiling)\nBastard is stealing my thunder.\n\nMalkovich and Truman on the stage. Truman is pacing,\nswirling, dancing, juggling enormous bowling pins as he\ntalks.\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET\nAll right! I'll take it away! He'll be\ndelivered from madness. What then?\nHe'll feel himself acceptable! What\nthen?\n\nMalkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman\nout of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on\nthe bench. He levitates. Spins in mid-air. Falls on all\nfours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog.\nTruman watches Malkovich, continues to speak. But now, when\nhe talks, fire comes out of his mouth.\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)\nI'll heal the rash on his body. I'll\nerase the welts cut into his body by\nflying manes.\n\nThe audience \"ooohs\" at the flames. Malkovich rips off his\nclothes and convulses into the dying swan-bit from \"Swan\nLake.\" The audience applauds. Truman continues his speech,\nnow transforming himself into an actual 60 foot swan and\nflying around the auditorium as he speaks.\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)\nYou won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses\nwill be quite safe. You'll save your\npennies every week, till you can\nchange that scooter into a car...\n\nThe audience watches the giant swan overhead, necks craned,\nin awe. Malkovich sighs. He is out of his league. He goes\ninto a remarkable tap dance routine and sings \"Mr.\nBojangles\", but nobody even looks at the stage. The giant\nswan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns\nto a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual Harry S.\nTruman. Truman looks confused and disoriented, as if just\nraised from the dead.\n\nACTUAL TRUMAN\nWhere am I? Aren't I dead?\n(possessed)\nVote for Mantini!\n\nTruman grows and grows until he is again just a giant\npuppet. The audience bursts into applause, then delivers a\nstanding ovation. Truman bows. Flemmer laughs wildly in the\ncatwalks. Malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS\n\nMalkovich walks past Maxine. She doesn't even look at him.\nThunderous applause is heard in the background.\n\nMALKOVICH\nGood-bye, Maxine.\n\nMAXINE\nWhatever.\n\nMalkovich drops limply to the floor. He lifts his head.\n\nMALKOVICH\n(weak but relieved)\nI'm back! My nightmare is over.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. CATWALK - CONTINUOUS\n\nFlemmer watches Malkovich from above. He pulls out a\nwalkie-talkie.\n\nFLEMMER\n(into walkie-talkie)\nOkay, now!\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n\nLester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds\nthe walkie-talkie, has just received word. He nods, and\nthe Malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal,\nwhile shrieking a war cry.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS\n\nMaxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground.\nSuddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then\nby two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with\neach new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting\nout slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich\nis possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war\ncry and runs out onto the stage.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks.\nMalkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the\naudience.\n\nMALKOVICH\n(now sounding like fifty voices)\nI am your earthly king! Kneel before\nme!\n\nThe audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to\ntheir knees.\n\nCROWD\n(like automatons)\nHail Malkovich, king of the damned.\n\nMalkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in\nthe catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back.\n\nLotte appears in the back of the theater, an out-of-breath\nfigure in shadows. It is too late. She runs from the\ntheater.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS\n\nMaxine watches, somewhat amused. She turns and heads for\nthe exit.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. NEW JERSEY TUNPIKE - NIGHT\n\nA dejected Craig walks along the shoulder. He is wet and\ncold. We hold on him for a long while until he eventually\nmerges with the landscape.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nFADE IN\n\nEXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY\n\nCHYRON: LATER THAT WEEK\n\nSomething is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but\neverything is painted gray: the buildings, the streets,\nthe sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets,\ncarrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody\ntalks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky.\nThere is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie\ntheaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich\nmovies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating\nabout ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red,\njeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe\nand smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his\nlap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the\nstreet looks up.\n\nMALKOVICH\n(fifty voices)\nGreetings, my lowly subjects.\n\nFLORIS\nGreat things, my lonely subtext?\n\nMALKOVICH\n(rolls his eyes)\nBoy, be careful what you wish for.\n(to Floris)\nNever mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride,\nwill you?\n\nFloris shrugs, picks at her finger nails.\n\nMALKOVICH (CONT'D)\n(to the people on the street)\nI am bored. You will dance for your\nking now.\n\nWithout pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks\ninto a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally\nsilent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see\nthat Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is\nvoid of expression. Malkovich laughs.\n\nMALKOVICH (CONT'D)\nFaster! Faster, my little trained\nmonkeys!\n\nThe crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over,\nexhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to\nhelp, nobody dares.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY\n\nBird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every\ntree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves\nin, through some gray trees and gray brush to:\n\nA LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINT\n\nThis place is filled with life: Colorful birds, lizards,\ncats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but\ntotally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their\nposition. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the\nanimals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands\nand look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear\ngold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs.\n\nELIJAH (SUBTITLES)\nMust you take this terrible demon\non yourself, my love?\n\nLOTTE\nYes. I'm the only one. I have to enter\nMalkovich and destroy him from the\ninside. If not me, who?\n\nELIJAH (SUBTITLES)\nIf there was any way I could go in\nyour place. But I'm only a monkey\nand...\n\nLOTTE\n(puts finger to his lips)\nHush, sweetheart.\n\nLotte slips into a gray jumpsuit. She stuffs a homemade bomb\non her pocket. She and Elijah kiss passionately, then\nembrace.\n\nLOTTE\n(to the animals)\nI'll be with you always, my friends.\nWho knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll\nrejoin you with wings and a beak.\n\nELIJAH (SUBTITLES)\nWings and a halo, my darling. Wings\nand a halo.\n\nLotte turns quickly. This is too much to bear. She descends\ninto a storm drain. The animals stop what they're doing.\n\nPARROT\n(softly)\nGood-bye. Good-bye.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. MERTIN-FLEMMER BUILDING - DAY\n\nA man-hole cover lifts. Lotte pokes her head out. The coast\nis clear. She emerges. Assumes the dead-eyed expression of\nthe others, and enters the building.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. ELEVATOR - DAY\n\nLotte watches the floors change. After seven, she presses\nthe emergency stop button. The elevator jerks to a halt.\nShe picks up the crow bar in the corner, pries open the\ndoor. The 7 1/2 floor is gone. Nothing is there but pipes\nand wires and beams. She climbs out onto the floor.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BETWEEN FLOORS - CONTINUOUS\n\nLotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal. It\nis nowhere to be found. There is a noise behind her. She\nturns with a start. It's Craig, ragged and ill-shaven.\n\nLOTTE\nMy God!\n\nCRAIG\nI'm so glad you're safe. You look\nreally wonderful.\n\nLOTTE\nI'm in love. For the first time.\nIt's funny, but when it happens to\nyou, there's no question.\n\nCRAIG\nHe's a lucky man.\n(beat)\nDo I know him?\n\nLOTTE\nIt's Elijah.\n\nCRAIG\nThe iguana?\n\nLOTTE\nThe monkey.\n\nCRAIG\nOh, right. As long as you're happy.\nI'm sure he's a better lover than I\never was.\n\nLOTTE\nA better friend.\n\nCRAIG\n(beat)\nI'm sorry for everything.\n\nLOTTE\n(pecking him on the cheek)\nIt's okay, Craig. It all worked out,\nin an odd sort of way.\n\nCRAIG\nYou came up here looking for the\nportal?\n\nLOTTE\nYeah. I was going to kill him from\nthe inside.\n\nCRAIG\nAnd yourself too in the process. God,\nyou're so beautiful. Why couldn't I\nsee that before?\n\nLOTTE\nYou saw it once. Now you see it again.\nThat's life, isn't it? And you were\nup here to try the same thing, weren't\nyou?\n\nCRAIG\nI suppose. But they got here first,\nthe lousy bastards. So now it's all\nover, I guess.\n\nLOTTE\nI don't know. There's a small\ncommunity of us. We have a place they\ndon't know about. We're happy. We'll\nkeep trying to figure out a way. Come\nstay with us. Join the struggle.\n\nCRAIG\nYou'll have me, after all I've done\nto you?\n\nLOTTE\nPeople make mistakes.\n\nCRAIG\nI'm through with puppets, Lotte.\nI just want you to know that.\n\nLOTTE\nI know.\n\nCRAIG\nI'd like to be a farmer. I want to\nhelp things grow, to encourage life.\nDo you and your friends need a farmer?\n\nLOTTE\nSure. We could really use a farmer.\nWe'd be grateful for the help.\n(beat)\nAlso, I think, you know, if you\nwouldn't mind too terribly, a little\npuppet show every once in a while,\nwould do a lot to lift our spirits.\nYou know, if you wouldn't mind too\nterribly.\n\nCraig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly.\n\nLOTTE (CONT'D)\nOh honey. It's gonna be okay.\n\nShe puts her arm around him and leads him toward the\nelevator.\n\nCRAIG\nI love you, Lotte.\n\nWe come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put\nit around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament.\nWe follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a\nmarionette being controlled from above by an emotionless\nMantini in a gray jumpsuit.\n\nMANTINI\n(in Craig's voice)\nI can't wait to see where you and your\nfriends live, Lotte.\n\nLOTTE (O.S.)\nIt's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.\n\nNow we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w\nfollow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.\n\nFLEMMER\nOne serpent, coming up.\n\nFlemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves\ninto his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough,\nlooks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal\ntunnel.\n\nMUSIC IN: \"Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head\" by They\nMight Be Giants. It plays throughout the credits.\n\nFADE OUT\nTHE ENDEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/890508", "artist_names": "Daddy Dewdrop", "full_title": "Chick-A-Boom (Don't

yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow if there's a smile on my face\nIt's only there tryin\u2019 to fool the public\nBut when it comes down to foolin\u2019 you\nNow, honey, that's quite a different subject\nBut don't let my glad expression\nGive you the wrong impression\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nReally I'm sad\n(Sad, sad, sad, sad)\nOh, sadder than sad\n(I'm hurt so bad)\nYou're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad\n(I pretend to be glad)\nLike a clown, I pretend to be glad\n(Sad, sad, sad, sad)\n\n[Chorus]\nNow there's some sad things known to man\nBut ain't too much sadder than\nThe tears of a clown\nWhen there's no one around\nMmm-hmm, oh yeah, baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow if I appear to be carefree\nIt's only to camouflage my sadness\nIn order to shield my pride, I\u2019ve tried\nTo cover this hurt with a show of gladness\nBut don't let my show convince you\nThat I've been happy since you\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nDecided to go\n(Why did you go?)\nOh, I need you so\n(I need you so)\nI'm hurt and I want you to know\n(Want you to know)\nBut for others I put on a show\n(It's just a show) Ooh-oh\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThere's some sad things known to man\nBut ain't too much sadder than\nThe tears of a clown\nWhen there's no one around\nOh yeah\n\n[Verse 3]\nJust like Pagliacci did (The great pretender)\nI try to keep my sadness hid\nSmiling in the public eye (The great pretender)\nBut in my lonely room, I cry\n\n[Chorus]\nThe tears of a clown\nWhen there's no one around\nOh yeah, baby\n\n[Outro]\nNow if there's a smile on my face (Tears of clown)\nDon't let my glad expression (Tears of a clown)\nGive you the wrong impression\nDon't let this smile I wear (Tears of a clown)\nMake you think that I don't care\nWhen really I'm sad\nHurtin\u2019 so bad (Tears of a clown)\nCryin\u2019 all the time...7Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 7, "api_path": "/songs/110441", "artist_names": "The Jackson 5", "full_title": "I'll Be There by\u00a0The\u00a0Jackson 5",

emptiness within\nFor the thing that I want most in life's the thing that I can't win\n[Chorus]\nSpread your tiny wings and fly away\nAnd take the snow back with you\nWhere it came from on that day\nThe one I love forever is untrue\nAnd if I could you know that I would\nFly away with you\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe breeze along the river seems to say\nThat he'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay\nSo, little snowbird, take me with you when you go\nTo that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow\n\n[Chorus]\nSpread your tiny wings and fly away\nAnd take the snow back with you\nWhere it came from on that day\nThe one I love forever is untrue\nAnd if I could you know that I would\nFly away with you\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, if I could I know that I would\nFl-y-y-y-y

John Lennon was a rubbish musician. He took an interest in performing music during the skiffle craze of the late fifties, and the ragtag, untidy style was a perfect fit for the young Lennon. Unlike McCartney, he was devoid of almost any formal musical tuition, his famously stern Aunt Mimi preferring him to paint rather than to strum. When he began playing the guitar, his understanding of what he was actually doing was so low that he didn't even know his instrument had two strings missing until George Harrison pointed it out to him. After the passage of Beatlemania his understanding of how to use his talents was occasionally bolstered (by George Martin in the studio, and by people such as Donovan in India) but as a teenager he was very much a lone force.\n\nWhat he did possess was confidence, reams and reams of the stuff. This is what made him such a potent performer and drove him to better himself after meeting his opposite, the precise, natural musician that was Paul McCartney. In their early work, it is often said that Paul sung the love songs and that John sung the screamers. Whilst this is not entirely true (as I Saw Her Standing There, Long Tall Sally and I'm Down show, Paul was equally adept at rock n roll), the lions share of attention was on John in the early days. His stage presence spills over into his 1958-64 songwriting, full of loud guitar, empassioned delivery, and cocksure lyrics (You Can't Do That possibly sums up the young Lennon the best of any song in their catalogue).\n\nLennon's early work is full of bluesy sevenths, augmented chord changes and sudden shifts in musical direction. The majority of his earlier songs fit into one of three categories: straightforward blues (When I Get Home), thoughtful folk (I'm A Loser) or bitter, dissonant pop (It Won't Be Long). With eyesight so bad he could barely see what fret he was playing on, Lennon didn't write the next chord by following typical progressions, but rather by prodding around the fretboard until he found something that fitted. This created songs with unusual, ambiguous sounds in his early work such as I'll Be Back, and later on in his career gave him such moments as the F9 in the verse of Julia (\"calls me...\").\n\nUnlike McCartney, Lennon had an unsubtle singing voice and a comparatively small range. This meant his melodies lacked the scalar jumps of his partner's and instead carried a cynical, narrow sound that can be heard in many of their \"joint lead vocal\" songs (She Loves You being a great example, McCartney's leaping harmony juxtaposed against the downbeat Lennon). The most defining feature of Lennon's melodies is that they were often made up of one note repeated many times (Help!, I\u2019m Only Sleeping), or of a few of notes alternated between in quick succession (I Should Have Known Better, The Word, I Am The Walrus).\n\nLater in The Beatles' career, Lennon's increasing drug use and relationship with Yoko Ono changed him on every level. Fiercely rejecting his youthful arrogance (the third verse of Getting Better, \"man I was mean, but I'm changing my scene...\" tantamount to a confession from Lennon), he disowned every facet of his previous existence, including his estranged wife and son, Julian. Still capable of writing rock songs but largely disinterested with conventional music, he began to explore new methods of innovation, learning a fingerpicking style in India that facilitated his newfound introspection (Dear Prudence).\n\nBy the time The Beatles came to record Abbey Road, Lennon was spiritually no longer part of The Beatles. McCartney's magnum opus, the side two medley, was dismissed by Lennon as rubbish, who claimed that Come Together and Something were the only good songs on the album. Though his solo output showed some of his potential, his stint as a househusband was the death of his musical heyday. The two songs he wrote that were used for The Beatles Anthology, Free As A Bird and Real Love, are both musically lazy and uncharacteristically conventional. It is rude to both start and end this piece with an insult, however, so it must be said that John Lennon's style is almost impossible to replicate. Both simple and unique, it was a by-product of his own personality and as such, died with him.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/1357755", "artist_names": "The Originals", "full_title": "Baby, I'm For Real by\u00a0The\u00a0Originals", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/72f9df2fd6993f0aeeaf8637f59c338a.300x307x1.gif", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/72f9df2fd6993f0aeeaf8637f59c338a.586x600x1.gif", "id": 1357755, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 7705233, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1652520252, "path": "/The-originals-baby-im-for-real-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-originals-baby-im-for-real-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1969, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1969", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1969", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/72f9df2fd6993f0aeeaf8637f59c338a.300x307x1.gif", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/72f9df2fd6993f0aeeaf8637f59c338a.586x600x1.gif", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 17633}, "title": "Baby, I\u2019m For Real", "title_with_featured": "Baby, I'm For Real", "updated_by_human_at": 1653119896, "url": "https://genius.com/The-originals-baby-im-for-real-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/8865", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5508636432a59f0f73d26a8ee04df401.460x460x1.jpg", "id": 8865, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5508636432a59f0f73d26a8ee04df401.460x460x1.jpg", "index_character": "o", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "The Originals", "slug": "The-originals", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-originals"}, "artist": "The Originals", "lyrics": "Baby, I\u2019m For Real Lyrics[Verse 1]\nBaby, baby\nYou don't understand\nHow much I love you baby\nAnd how much I wanna be your only man, oh baby\n\n[Chorus]\nBaby, baby, baby\nYou don't have to go\nStay a little while longer baby\nI wanna talk to you just a little more\n[Verse 2]\nI see the little tears in your eyes about to fall\nYou are wondering if I'm for real\nBut if you cry, I wonder why you cry\nI tell you, know why this is how I feel\n\n[Bridge]\nBaby I'm for real\n(Baby I'm for real)\n(Baby I'm for real)\n\n[Verse 3]\nBut if you wanna know the truth about it\nGirl, I just couldn't live without you\nAnd that's why I'm confessing my love to you\nSo that I can live my whole life with you\n\n[Outro]\nBaby, baby, baby\n(My whole life with you)\nDon't leave\n(My whole life with you)\nNever, never, never, never gonna leave you, baby\n(My whole life with you)\nOoh\n(My whole life with you)\nBaby, babyYou might also likeEmbed"}]
