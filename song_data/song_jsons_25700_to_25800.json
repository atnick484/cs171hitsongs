see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror\nLookin' at myself like, there it is there\nYeah, like there it is there man, whoo!\nI ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands\nLike a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling\nYoung Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'\nWatch the way I handle it, uh\nBring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit\nShe know I'm the man with it,

can speak French (I think she's fluent)\n'Cause every night she studies hard in her room\n(At least that\u2019s what her parents assume)\nBut she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend\nHere's what she told me the time that I caught 'em\n[Chorus: All]\nShe said to me, \"Forget what you thought\n'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught\nSo just turn around

self-improvement\nI swear she lives in that library (Ooh)\nBut if you ask her she'll say, \"That's where you'll find me\"\nBut if you look, then you won't find her there\nShe may be clever, but she just acts too square\n'Cause in the back of the room where nobody looks (Nobody looks)\nShe'll be with her boyfriend (She's not reading books)\n\n[Chorus: All]\nShe said to me, \"Forget what you

you?\nDown on the West coast, I get this feeling like\nIt all could happen, that's why I'm leaving\nYou for the moment, you for the moment\nBoy Blue, yeah, you\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nYou're falling hard, I push away, I'm feelin' hot to the touch\nYou say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much\nBut something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush\nYour love, your love, my love\n\n[Chorus]\nI can see my baby swinging\nHis Parliament's on fire and his hands are up\nOn the balcony and I'm singing\nOoh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love\nI can see my sweet boy swaying\nHe's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la\nOn the balcony and I'm saying\nMove, baby, move, baby, I'm in love\nI'm in love (I'm in love)\nI'm in love (I'm in love)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Mic-check)\n(One, two)\n(Two, two)\n(Get it, girl)\n\n[Verse 2]\nDown on the West coast, they got their icons\nTheir silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons\nAnd you've got the music\nYou've got the music in you, don't you?\nDown on the West coast, they love their movies\nTheir golden gods and Rock 'n' Roll groupies\nAnd you've got the music\nYou've got the music in you, don't you?\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]\nYou push

money on me right now\nAnd I told you to wait\nYeah, I told you to wait\nSo I'ma need a little more time now\n'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now\nAnd I thought you could wait\nYeah, I thought you could wait\nThese bitches surroundin' me (Black bodies)\nAll want something out me\nThen they talk about me\nWould be lost without me\nWe could've been somebody\nThought you'd be different 'bout it\nNow I know you naughty\nSo let's get on with it\n[Chorus 1]\nWe could've been somebody\n'Stead, you had to tell somebody\nLet's take it back to the first party\nWhen you tried your first molly\nAnd came out of your body\nAnd came out of your body\nRunning naked down the lobby\nAnd you were screamin' that you love me\nBefore the limelight tore ya\nBefore the limelight stole ya\nRemember we were so young\nWhen I would hold you\nBefore the blood on the leaves\nI know there ain't wrong with me\nSomething strange is happenin'\n\n[Chorus 2]\nYou could've been somebody\nWe could've, ugh, we could've been somebody\nOr was it on the first party\nWhen we tried our first molly\nAnd came out of our body\nAnd came out of our body\nBefore they call lawyers\nBefore you tried to destroy us\nHow you gon' lie to the lawyer?\nIt's like I don't even know ya\nI gotta bring it back to the 'nolia\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nFuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my

Lyrics[Verse 1: King Chip]\nI'm just what you made God \u2014 not many I trust\nI'ma go my own way God, take my fate to wherever you want\nI'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some\nClub-hoppin', tryna get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung\nEarly in the morning, I'm wakin', bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'\nAin't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it\nThank the Lord for that burning bush\nThat big body Benz I was born to push\nOn my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us\nNeighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down\nI say, \"Ain't no music on\", she said, \"No, that weed is loud\"\nNigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'\nI've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'\n[Chorus: Kid Cudi]\nI need smoke\nI need to smoke\nWho gon' hold me down now?\nI wanna get high y'all\nI wanna get high y'all\nNeed it need it to get by y'all\nCan you get me high y'all?\nI wanna get high y'all\nI wanna get high y'all\nNeed it need it to get by y'all\nCan you get me high y'all?\n\n[Post-Chorus: Kid Cudi]\nI'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)\nI'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made\n(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God\nI'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God\n\n[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]\nLet me tell you \u2018bout my month y'all, in the shop and I had a ball\nI had to ball for therapy, my shrink don\u2019t think that helps at all\nWhatever, that man ain\u2019t wearing these leather pants\nI diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain\u2019t working fam\nI- In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand\nI know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you\u2019d understand\nBut, I can\u2019t fold, some poor soul got it way worse\nWe\u2019re all troubled, in a world in trouble\nIt\u2019s scary to have a kid walk this Earth\nI\u2019m what you made God, fuck yes I\u2019m so odd\nThinking 'bout all my old friends who weren\u2019t my friends all along\nHm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors\nEveryday to find sane\u2019s a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors\nYou might also like[Chorus: Kid Cudi]\nI need smoke\nI need to smoke\nWho gon' hold me down now?\nI wanna get high y'all\nI wanna get high y'all\nNeed it need it to get by y'all\nCan you get me high y'all?\nI wanna get high y'all\nI wanna get high y'all\nNeed it need it to get by y'all\nCan you get me high y'all?\n\n[Post-Chorus: Kid Cudi]\nI'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)\nI'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made\n(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God\nI'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made

blue eyes looking into mine\nLike we had our own secret club\nI remember you dancing before bed time\nThen jumping on me waking me up\nI can still feel you hold my hand, little man\nAnd even the moment I knew\nYou fought it hard like an army guy\nRemember I leaned in and whispered to you\n[Chorus]\n\"Come on, baby, with me\nWe're going to fly away from here\nYou were my best four years\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember the drive home\nWhen the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, \"Why?\"\nFlowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say\nAbout a beautiful boy who

the beat goes dumb\nAnd I only spit heat 'cause I'm playing for the Son\nPlaying for the king, playing for the title\nI'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible\nI'm so tight I might go psycho\nChristmas time, so here's a recital\nI'm so bad like Michael, I know\nI'm still young, but I go, I go\nStupid, stupid, love like Cupid\nI'm the drummer boy, so do it, do it\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber & (Busta Rhymes)]\nLittle baby, pa rum pum pum pum (Yeah)\nI am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum\n(Let's gather 'round the mistletoe real quick)\nI have no gifts to bring, pa rum pum pum

straight to it)\n\n[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]\nYo, at the table with the family, havin' dinner\nBlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker\nThen I took a look to see before it activates the ringer\nCame to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter\nThen I hit him back, despite I had some food up on my fingers\nSippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla\nEven though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla\nBieber hit me back and said, \"Let's make it hot up in the winter\", I said \"Cool\"\nYou know I'ma deliver\nLet's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger\nBefore we work, I gotta get this off\nSee the other family members and drop gifts off\nThen I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how\nYou know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now\nPeople everywhere and all our Twitter followers\nMerry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah\nSee Justin Bieber LiveGet tickets as low as $74You might also like[Chorus: Justin

pum pum\n\n[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]\nIf you wanna give, it's the time of year\nJB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the snare\nIt's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care\nWhen there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair\nIt's about time for you to act merrily\nIt's about time for you to give to charity\nRarely do people even wanna help at all\n'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls\nNot thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold\nWishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold\nSo I think some of you need to act bold\nGive a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe\n\n[Outro: Justin Bieber]\nI'm the drummer boy so do it, do it\nI'm the drummer boy so do it, do it\nI'm the drummer boy so do it, do

footsteps on my stairs\nSix months gone and I'm still reaching\nEven though I know you're not there\nI was playing back a thousand memories, baby\nThinking 'bout everything we've been through\nMaybe I've been going back too much lately\nWhen time stood still and I had you\n\n[Chorus]\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\nStand in the rain outside 'til I came out\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou could, you could if you just said you're sorry\nI know that we could work it out somehow\nBut if this was a movie, you'd be here by now\n[Verse 2]\nI know people change and these things happen\nBut I remember how it was back then\nWrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'\n'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them\nNow I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street\nFlashback to the night when you said to me\nThat nothing's gonna change, not for me and you\nNot before I knew how much I had to lose\n\n[Chorus]\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\nStand in the rain outside 'til I came out\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou
