everything\n\n[Verse 2]\nThen he opened up his billfold and threw a 20 down\nAnd a faded photograph fell out and hit the ground\nAnd I picked it up, he said thank you bud, I put it in his hand\nHe said I probably ought to throw this one away\n'Cause she's the reason I feel this way, I hate everything\n[Chorus]\nI hate my job, I hate my life\nAnd if it weren't for my two kids, I'd hate my ex-wife\nI know I should move on and try to start again\nBut I just can't get over her leaving me for him\nThen he shook his head and looked down at his ring\nAnd said I hate everything\n\n[Verse 3]\nHe said one bedroom apartment where I get my mail\nIs really not a home, it's more like a jail\nWith a swimming pool and a parking lot view, man that's just great\nI hate summer, winter, fall and spring\nRed and yellow, purple, blue and green, I hate everything\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate my job, I hate my life\nAnd if it weren't for my two kids, I'd hate my ex-wife\nI know I should move on and try to

world, but you just wanted arguing\nFrom the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again\nEven if flipped out on me at the mall again\n\"It's all his fault again,\" that's what you're telling all your friends\nI ain't pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again\nSee how your day going I know they stressing on you\nI know them times get hard that's why I'm checking on you\nIt's

place)\nWon't you sit yourself down and take a seat\nAnd let me ease your mind girl, we gon' do it our way (our way)\n\n[Verse 2: Nelly]\nI heard your friend tell a friend that told a friend of mine\nThat you was thinking that we should do it one more time\nIf this ain't the truth then hopefully it's not a lie\n'Cause I ain't got no issue with hitting that another time\nWe never had a problem with getting it done\nDisagreed upon a lot ma, but the sex wasn't one\nNow check it I know you get excited (still) when I come around and bite it\n(Girl) quit frowning up and quit acting like you don't like it\n(I like it) I know you like, (I like it)\nYou really like it, (I really, really like it)\n(I want it), I know you want it, (adore it)\nAdore it, (so come let me enjoy it)\nSee Nelly

Why are you even alive? (Why?)\nWhy they kill 2Pac and Chris?\nWhy at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin' Cris?

It's only the hawk\nWhy my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York?\nWhy they forcin' you to be hard?\nWhy ain't you a thug by choice?\nWhy the whole world love my voice?\nWhy?

Saturday and Monday, I was on that receiver\nIt's me (Me) your girl (Girl), your life (Life), your world (World)\nMy family and friends, they just don't understand\nThey say I should leave you alone\nBut I say, that they all should just leave us alone\nDon't you get it?\nSee Monica LiveGet tickets as low as $87You might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nI never ever cheated, I never ever lied\nSo you can stop askin', askin' me why\nWhy I never left you and why I kept it real\nAnd why I'm still with you\n\n[Chorus]\nYou should've known better than to think I would leave (Oh-oh)\nYou should've known better Than to doubt me\n(Don't you doubt me)\nIt don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down\nEither way, I'm gonna be around (Be)\nYou should've known that I would stay by your side\n(By your side, baby)\nShould've known your girl was gonna ride or die (Ride or die)\nAnd it just don't matter (Don't matter to me, baby)\nIf you're rich or poor, out or in, doin' five to ten\nYou should've known better (Better)\n\n[Instrumental Breakdown]\n\n[Chorus]\nYou should've known better than to think I would leave\n(You shoulda known)\nYou should've known better than to doubt me\n(You shoulda known)\nIt don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down\nEither way, I'm gonna be around\nYou should've known that I would stay by your side\n(No matter what they think about you)\nShould've known your girl was gonna ride or die\n(There's nothing I can do without you)\nAnd it just don't matter if you're rich or poor (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nOut or in, doin' five to ten (Oh, ooh)\nYou should've known

back, all black gloves\nI'm 80's man, but the boy smack thugs\nThese record sales equal more back rubs\nNot to mention I bought a pack of clubs\nHis impacts about as raw as crack was\nNow all these

"I Miss You Lyrics[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nHello, there\nThe angel from my nightmare\nThe shadow in the background of the morgue\nThe unsuspecting victim\nOf darkness in the valley\nWe can live like Jack and Sally if we want\nWhere you can always find me\nAnd we'll have Halloween on Christmas\nAnd in the night, we'll wish this never ends\nWe'll wish this never ends\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nWhere are you?\nAnd I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\nYou might also like[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're

already\nThe voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you187Embed"}, {"_type":

that she majored in don't make no money\nBut she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny\nNow, tell me that ain't insecurr\nThe concept of school seems so securr\nSophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr\nShe like, \"Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair\"\n'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs\nOf new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care\nShe's so precious with the peer pressure\nCouldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis\nShe had hair so long that it looked like weave\nThen she cut it all off, now she look like Eve\nAnd she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe\nSingle black female addicted to retail, and well\n[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]\nOh, when it all, it all falls down\nAnd when it falls down,

always see me with at least one of my watches\nRollies and Pashas done drove me crazy\nI can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!\nThen I spent four hundred bucks on this\nJust to be like, \"Nigga, you ain't up on this\"\nAnd I can't even go to the grocery store\nWithout some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team\nIt seem we livin' the American Dream\nBut the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem\nThe prettiest people do the ugliest things\nFor the road to riches and diamond rings\nWe shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us\nWe tryna buy back our 40 acres\nAnd for that paper, look how low we'll stoop\nEven if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe\nYou might also like[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]\nOh, when it all, it all falls

down\nAnd when it all falls down\n\n[Verse 3: Kanye West]\nI say, \"Fuck the police,\" that's how I treat 'em\nWe buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom\nWe'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em\nThings we buy to cover up what's inside\n'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth\nThat's why shorty's hollerin', \"Where the ballers at?\"\nDrug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack\nAnd the white man get paid off of all of that\nBut I ain't even gon' act holier than thou\n'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou\nBefore I had a house and I'd do it again\n\u2018Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz\nI want to act ballerific like it's all terrific\nI got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific\nI got a problem with spendin' before

'cause more is less ('cause more is less)\nIt's all an endless process\n[Chorus]\nI miss Mayberry\nSittin' on the porch, drinkin' ice-cold cherry coke\nWhere everything is black and white\n(Na-na,

earth shoutin'\nThrough the trees, as the wind blows\nThat's when I climb up here on this mountain\nTo look through God's window\nNow I can't fly, but I got two feet\nTo get me high up here\nAbove the noise and city streets\nMy worries disappear\n\n[Chorus]\nI miss Mayberry\nSittin' on the porch, drinkin' ice-cold cherry coke\nWhere everything is black and white\n(Na-na, na-na,

year on my birthday\nShe lost all track of time and burnt the cake\nAnd every smoke detector\nIn the house was going off\nAnd she was just about to cry\nUntil I took her in my arms\nAnd I tried not to let her see me laugh\nYeah I live for little moments like that\n[Verse 3]\nI know she's not perfect\nBut she tries so hard for me\nAnd I thank god that she isn't\nCause how boring would that be\nIt's the little imperfections\nIt's the sudden change in plans\nWhen she misreads the directions\nAnd we're lost but holding hands\nYeah I live for little moments like that\n\n[Verse 4]\nWhen she's laying on my shoulder\nOn the sofa in the dark\nAnd about the time she falls asleep\nSo does my right arm\nAnd I want so bad to move it\nCause it's tinglin' and it's numb\nBut she looks so much like an
