Teardrops Lyrics(bill anderson/steve wariner)\n(track 2 - time 4: 29)\n\nTwo teardrops were floatin' down the river\nOne teardrop said to the other\nI'm from the soft blue eyes of a woman in love\nI'm a tear of joy she couldn't carry\nShe was so happy she just got married\nI was on her cheek when she wiped me away with her glove\nI could tell from the look on her face she didn't need me\nSo I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea\nThe other tear said we've got a connection\nI'm a tear of sorrow born of rejection\nI'm from the sad brown eyes of her old flame\nShe told him they would be lifelong companions\nLeft him with questions and not any answers\nI was on his cheek as he stood there calling her name\nI could tell he had a lot of my friends for company\nSo I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea\n\nOh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight\nTwo more teardrops somebody cried\nOne of them happy and one of them bluer than blue\nThe tide goes out and the tide comes in\nAnd someday they'll be teardrops again\nReleased in a moment of pleasure or a moment of pain\nThen they drift on down and ride to the sea again\n\nLast night I sat in the waiting room\nThe nurse walked in and gave me the news\nIt's a baby girl and they're both fine\nAn old man sittin' not 10 feet away\nJust lost his wife and he said to me\nYou've got a brand new angel and I've lost mine\nI guess the good lord giveth and the good lord taketh away\nAnd we both wiped a teardrop from our face\nYou might also likeOh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight\nTwo more teardrops somebody cried\nOne of them happy and one of them bluer than blue\nThe tide goes out and the tide comes in\nA whole new circle of life begins\nWhere tears are a part of the pleasure and part of the pain\n'til they drift on down and ride to the sea again\n\nTwo teardrops floatin' down the river\nTwo teardrops floatin' down the riverEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

stranger\nBut I don't like her\nShe may be an angel who spends all winter\nBringing the homeless blankets and dinner\nA regular Nobel Peace Prize winner\nBut I really hate her\nI'll think of a reason later\nI drew horns and blacked out her tooth with a marker\nChildish, yes, but she made such a thin little target\nI couldn't be happier on my own\nBut I've got the slightest of a jealous bone\nAnd seeing her with him tends to enlarge it\n\nIt may be my family's redneck nature\nRubbing off\nBringing out unlady-like behavior\nIt sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger\nBut I don't like her\nShe may be an angel who spends all winter\nBringing the homeless blankets and dinner\nA regular Nobel Peace Prize winner\nBut I really hate her\nI'll think of a reason later\n\nInside her head may lay all the answers\nFor curin' diseases from baldness to cancer\nSalt of the earth and a real good dancer\nBut I really hate her\nI'll think of a reason later\n\n(Spoken)\nWell, it was just one tooth\nDid I

1]\nBaby I really know by now\nSince we met that day\nYou showed me the way\nI felt it then you gave me love, I can't describe\nHow much I feel for you\nI said baby I should have known by now\nShould have been right there whenever you gave me love\nAnd if only you were here\nI'd tell you yes I'd tell you (oh yeah)\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nHonestly, could it be you and me\nLike it was before neither less or more\n'Cause when I close my eyes at night\nI realize that no one else could ever take your place\nI still can feel and it's so unreal\nWhen you're touching me, kisses endlessly\nIt's just a place in the sun where our love's begun\nI miss you, yes I miss you baby, oh yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Interlude]\nIf I knew how to tell you what's on my mind\n(Make you understand)\nThen I'd always be

me, saying\n\"Get back together, come back and see me\"\nThree days since the living room\nI realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you\nYesterday, you'd forgiven me\nBut it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry\n[Verse 1: Ed Robertson]\nHold it now and watch the hoodwink\nAs I make you stop, think\nYou'll think you're looking at Aquaman\nI summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss\nI like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan\nHot like wasabi when I bust rhymes\nBig like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value\nBert Kaempfert's got the mad hits\nYou try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through\nGonna make a break and take a fake\nI'd like a stinking aching shake\nI like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours\nGotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know\nThe vertigo is gonna grow\n'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver\n[Pre-Chorus: Ed Robertson and Steven Page]\nHow can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?\nTrying hard not to smile, though I feel bad\nI'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral\nCan't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will\nI have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve\nI have a history of taking off my shirt\n\n[Chorus 2: Steven Page]\nIt's been one week since you looked at me\nThrew your arms in the air and said, \"You're crazy\"\nFive days since you tackled me\nI've still got the rug burns on both my knees\nIt's been three days since the afternoon\nYou realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon\nYesterday, you'd forgiven me\nAnd now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry\n\n[Verse 2: Ed Robertson]\nChickity China, the Chinese chicken\nYou have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'\nWatching X-Files with no lights on\nWe're dans la maison\nI hope the Smoking Man's in this one\nLike Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic\nLike Sting, I'm tantric\nLike Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy\nLike Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films\nBut if I did they'd have a Samurai\nGonna get a set of better clubs\nGonna find the kind with tiny nubs\nJust so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing\nGotta get in tune with Sailor Moon\n'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes\nThat make me think the wrong thing\nSee Barenaked Ladies LiveGet tickets as low as $34You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Ed Robertson and Steven Page]\nHow can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?\nTrying hard not to smile, though I feel bad\nI'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral\nCan't understand what I mean? You soon will\nI have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve\nI have a history of losing my shirt\n\n[Chorus 3: Steven Page and Ed Robertson]\nIt's been one week since you looked at me\nDropped your arms to the sides and said, \"I'm sorry\"\nFive days since I laughed at you and said\n\"You just did just what I thought you were gonna do\"\nThree days since the living room\nWe realized we're both to blame but what could we do?\nYesterday, you just smiled at me\n'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry\n\n[Outro: Steven Page and Ed Robertson]\nIt'll still be two days 'til we say

aight, keep your head up)\nI think I saw your baby motha'\nCreepin' at yo back door, hey, hey-ay\nAnd yo lying ass been cheatin'\nAnd I can't take it no more, oh oh\nI'm movin' on\n[Chorus: Mya (Silkk, Mya)]\nOn (Move on, movin' on, and move my way)\nOn (Movin' on-on)\nOh-on (Move on)\nI'll be movin' on (And move my way)\nOn (Move on, movin' on, and move my way)\nOn (Movin' on-on)\nOh-on (Move on)\nI'll be movin' on (And move my way, say what, say what)\n\n[Verse 2: Mya (Silkk, Mya)]\nWhose drawers are these?\nYou know I wear a size 4 (Huh what, say what)\nAnd if you say that you've been faithful (Faithful)\nWho was at your back door?\n\nYou ain't got no money (It don't matter what I got, I got some)\nI should've left you long ago\nAnd you stroke ain't strokin' no more (No more)\nSo I've been sleepin all alone (You can't sleep by yourself)\nIf ya know what I mean (Know I'm sayin'?)\nI'm movin' on\n\n[Chorus: Mya (Silkk, Mya)]\nOn (Move on, movin' on, and move my

'bout it\"\nNow one to the two\nTwo to the three\nI ain't sayin' leave him\nBut you need to like roll wit me\nCause I can see you ain't happy here\nWhen I look in your eyes\nYou a virgin, you gotta spread your wings\nSo now it's time to fly\nYou ain't ever gotta trip\nOr remind me\nI'm trying to live ghetto fab\nLike takin' baths in bottles of Dom P\nBut I ain't perfect\nCould you imagine me with no flaws?\nIt's like a parking lot with no cars\nCell block with no bars\nWorld with no wars, L.A. with no stars (No stars)\nCheck this out, I can heal your broken heart\nSo don't be so fast to react so quick\nOr get all mad and try to scratch up my 6\nNow you know I get paid\nFor bustin' all kind of tight verses\nBut see, I need a girl that I can see on top\nLike Silkk and Mya\nOr vice versa\n[Chorus: Mya (Silkk, Mya)]\nI'm movin' on\nOn (Move on, I'll be, and move my way)\nOn (Movin' on-on)\nOh-on (Move on)\nI'll be movin' on (And move my way, Good bye, goodbye baby)\nOn (Move on,

gonna be cool)\nOn (You know what?)\nOn (Let's go on a shopping spree or somethin')\n(Let's go take a vacation or somethin')\nMovin' on\n\n[Outro: Silkk The Shocker]\nLet's go do somethin'\nGet away from this ghetto\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nGet away from the spot\nTake you away from all this\nJust gimme a chance\nCome on, come on, come on\nLet's move on3Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

you make me feel\nYou got me in this fantasy\nAnd all my friends keep tellin' me\nShorty's kinda hot, so what's the deal?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCause we been spendin', rollin', livin', showin'\nWe got some time for play\nBut you've been player hatin', waitin'\nFor this rhyme to pass away\n\n[Chorus]\nShorty you keep playin' with my mind\nYou tease me all the time but I had enough\nMaybe I should ask your girlfriends why\nWhy you are so afraid to fall in love\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou only get the best with me\nI wanna give you everything\nAnd anything you ask of me I will\nAnd I don't want to front on you\nSo tell me what you wanna do\nAnd if I'm not the one\nJust keep it real\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCause we been spendin', rollin', livin', showin'\nWe got some time for play\nBut you've been player

I say splittin' wigs and readin' brains\nI mean breakin' it down conversation-wise\nLet me explain\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm in your corner, girl be on my team\nTogether we could fulfill each other's life dream\nWe both Gemini so we got 2 sides\nOur zodiac sign is the perfect sign\nCause she replied, \"All Gemini's lie\"\nI guess this is what it feels like when doves cry\nYour attitude is deep cover\nWon't give me the number\nCold play me out like a foul, a bleep or a blunder\nIt's like a burnin' in the chest, a cardiac arrest\nYou look like you havin' fun puttin' me thru stress\nSo in between time and in the meantime\nYou do your thing and I do mine\nBut don't play wit my mind\n[Break]\nShorty, shorty\nWon't you please get naughty with me\nAnd if you really wanna\nI can be your fantasy\nYou are so afraid, oh baby\n\n[Chorus]\nShorty you keep playin' with my mind\nYou tease me all the time but I had enough\nMaybe I should ask your girlfriends why\nWhy you are so afraid to

Lyrics[Verse 1]\n'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony that's life\nTrying to make ends meet, you're a slave to money then you die\nI'll take you down the only road I've ever been down\nYou know the one that takes you to the places\nWhere all the veins meet, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nNo change, I can change\nI can change, I can change\nBut I'm here in my mould\nI am here in my mould\nBut I'm a million different people from one day to the next\nI can't change my mould\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\n(Have you ever been down?)\n[Verse 2]\nWell I've never prayed, but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah\nI need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah\nI let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now\nBut the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now\n\n[Chorus]\nNo change, I can change\nI can change, I can change\nBut I'm here in my mould\nI am here in my mould\nAnd I'm a million different people from one day to the next\nI can't change my mould\nNo, no, no, no, no\nHave you ever been down?\nI can't change it you know, I can't change it\n\n[Verse 3]\n'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, that's life\nTrying to make ends meet\nTrying to find some money, then you die\nI'll take you down the only road I've ever been down\nYou know the one that takes you to the places\nWhere all the veins meet, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know I can change, I can change\nI can change, I can change\nBut I'm here in my mould\nI am here in my mould\nAnd I'm a million different people from one day to the next\nI can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no\nI can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no\nI can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no\nYou've gotta change my mould, no, no, no\n(It's just sex and violence, melody and silence)\n(It's just  sex and violence, melody and violence)\n(It's just sex and silence, melody and silence)\n(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)\n(It's just sex and violence, melody and silence)\n(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)\n(It's just sex and violence, melody and violence)\nBeen down\nEver been down\n(I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no)\n(It's just sex and violence,

the trees are crowned with leaves\nWhen the ash and oak and the birch and yew\nAre dressed in ribbons fair\nWhen owls call the breathless moon\nIn the blue veil of the night\nThe shadows of the trees appear\nAmidst the lantern light\n\n[Chorus]\nWe've been rambling all the night\nAnd some time of this day\nNow returning back again\nWe bring a garland gay\n[Verse 2]\nWho will go down to those shady groves\nAnd summon the shadows there\nAnd tie a ribbon on those sheltering arms\nIn the springtime of the year\nThe songs of birds seem to fill the wood\nThat when the fiddler plays\nAll their voices can be heard\nLong past their woodland days\n\n[Chorus]\nWe've been rambling all the night\nAnd some time of this day\nAnd now returning back again\nWe bring a garland gay\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd so they linked their hands and danced\nRound in circles and in rows\nAnd so the journey of the night descends\nWhen all the shades are gone\nA garland gay we bring you here\nAnd at your door we stand\nIt is a sprout well budded out\nThe work of our Lord's hand\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWe've been rambling all the night\nAnd some time of this day\nAnd now returning back again\nWe bring a garland

is bad enough\nBut something's coming over me to make me wonder\nToo much of nothing is just as tough\nI need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied\n\n[Verse 2: Ginger & Posh]\nUnwrap yourself from around my finger\nHold me too tight or left to linger\nSomething fine built to last\nSlipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Sporty]\nYes my dear you know he soothes me (moves me)\nThere's no complication, there's no explanation\nIt's just a groove in me\n\n[Chorus: All]\nToo much of something is bad enough (bad enough)\nBut something's coming over me to make me wonder\nToo much of nothing is just as tough (just as tough)\nI need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied\n\n[Bridge: Sporty]\nWhat part of no don't you understand\n(understand,

Beginning Lyrics[Verse 1: Donna Lewis, Richard Marx, Both]\nWe were strangers, starting out on a journey\nNever dreaming, what we'd have to go through\nNow here we are, I'm suddenly standing\nAt the beginning with you\nNo one told me, I was going to find you\nUnexpected, what you did to my heart\nWhen I lost hope\nYou were there to remind me\nThis is the start\n[Chorus: Donna Lewis & Richard Marx]\nAnd life is a road and I wanna keep goin'\nLove is a river I wanna keep flowing\nLife is a road now and forever wonderful journey\nI'll be there when the world stops turning\nI'll be there when the storm is through\nIn the end I want to be standing\nAt the beginning with you\n\n[Verse 2: Donna Lewis, Richard Marx, Both]\nWe were strangers on a crazy adventure\nNever dreaming how our dreams would come true\nNow here we stand, unafraid of the future\nAt the beginning with you\n\n[Chorus: Donna Lewis & Richard Marx]\nAnd life is a road and I wanna keep goin'\nLove is a river I wanna keep flowing\nLife is a road now and forever wonderful journey\nI'll be there when the world stops turning\nI'll be there when the storm is through\nIn the end I want to be standing\nAt the beginning with you\n\n[Bridge: Donna Lewis & Richard Marx]\nKnew there was somebody somewhere\nI need love in the dark\nNow I know my dream will live on\nI've been waiting so long\nNothing is going to tear us
