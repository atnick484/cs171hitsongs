boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though\nYounger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so\nI see nothing better, I keep him forever\nLike a vendetta-ta\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI, I, I see how this is gon' go\nTouch me and you'll never be alone\nI-Island breeze and lights down low\nNo one has to know\n[Chorus]\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nYou should see the things we do, baby\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nI know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time\nAre you ready for it?\n\n[Verse 2]\nKnew I was a robber first time that he saw me\nStealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry\nBut if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and\nWe'll move to an island, and\nAnd he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor\nEvery love I've known in comparison is a failure\nI forget their names now, I'm so very tame now\nNever be the same now, now\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI, I, I see how this is gon' go\nTouch me and you'll never be alone\nI-Island breeze and lights down low\nNo one has to know (No one has to know)\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nYou should see the things we do, baby\nIn the middle of the night in my dreams\nI know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time\nAre you ready for it?\nOh, are you ready for it?\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $250You might also like[Refrain]\nBaby, let the

heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave\nAnd the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name\nSo when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?\nDid I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?\nLegend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria\nTrudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us\nGot 20,000 deep off in the street

wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it\nAfter the drums and the guitars all faded\nWas the best they could do good enough?\nOr did the heartland just swallow 'em up?\nHow did my mom and my dad ever do it?\nIf there was struggles, then we never knew it\nI guess they had each other\nThat was enough\n[Chorus]\nYou know you can't keep the ground from shaking\nNo matter how hard you try\nYou can't keep the sunsets from fading\nYou gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing\nBaby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark\nYou gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart\nYou gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat am I gonna tell my kids when they see all of this bullshit that goes down on TV?\nWhen the whole world is down on its luck\nI gotta make sure they keep their chin up\nCry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny\nChase after the dream, don't chase after the money\nAnd know we got each other\nThat's what's up\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking\nNo matter how hard you try\nYou can't keep the sunsets from fading\nYou gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing\nBaby

one\nHe redefines in every way what love is\nShe fell for him and hasn't gotten up since\nEvery now and then, she goes off, though\nBeating on his chest like a bongo\nHe understands she's coming from a hurt place\nAnswers all the questions on her survey\nDoesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust\nDoesn't call her, \"Ho\" after hang-ups\nGive her everything she ever wanted\nAnd even though she still feels haunted\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's falling in love now, losing control now\nFighting the truth, trying to hide\nBut I think it's alright, girl\nYeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh\nShe's falling in

these rappers' cards?\n'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard\nI turn that fuckin' soft into some hard\nI grew up in the streets without no heart\nI'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon\n[Verse 1]\nI sit back and read like Cat in the Hat\n21 Savage the cat with the MAC\n21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood\nBut I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back\nStuart Little, heard these niggas some rats\nPockets full of cheese, bitch, I got racks\nI'm a real street nigga, bitch\nI am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax\nPussy niggas love sneak dissin'\n'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire\nWet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house\nKeep shootin' until somebody die\nSo many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar\nThought it was Fourth of July\nYou was with your friends playin' Nintendo\nI was playin' 'round with that fire\nSeventh grade, I got caught with a pistol\nSent me to Panthersville\nEighth grade, started playin' football\nThen I was like fuck the field\nNinth grade, I was knocking niggas out\nNigga like Holyfield\nFast forward, nigga, 2016\nAnd I'm screamin' fuck a deal\nBad bitch with me, she so thick\nI don't even need a pill\nI listened to your raps, thought you was hard\nYou ain't even street for real\nNiggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter\nThey don't want beef for real\nAnd all these niggas play like they tough\n'Til a nigga get killed\n'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled\nI'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'\n\"I been with you since day one\nSavage, I ain't even hatin'\"\nSo what's up with all that Instagram shit?\n\"Savage, I was just playin'\"\nY'all pussy niggas fakin'\nBitch, I hang around them Haitians\nPull up on you, tie your kids up\nPistol whip you while your bitch naked\n\"Come on, man, Savage, you know I always play your mixtape\"\nYeah, nigga, fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYoung Savage, why you trappin' so

it's a small town girl\nEverything is right and we rule the world\n2 twelve's in the truck back, beating\nA bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa\nEverything

Dallas just to buy an Easter dress\nWe'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas\nGod knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be\nI learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree\n[Chorus]\nHey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn\nDoing it all by hand\nCause when everything is handed to you\nIt's only worth as much as the time put in\nIt all just seemed so

that door\nI didn't know they did that anymore\nWho knew we owned eight thousand salad plates?\nFor years I've roamed these empty halls\nWhy have a ballroom with no balls?\nFinally they're opening up the gates\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kristen Bell]\nThere'll be actual, real, live people\nIt'll be totally strange\nBut, wow, am I so ready for this change\n[Chorus: Kristen Bell]\n'Cause for the first time in forever\nThere'll be music, there'll be light\nFor the first time in forever\nI'll be dancing through the night\nDon't know if I'm elated or gassy\nBut I'm somewhere in that zone\n'Cause for the first time in forever\nI won't be alone\n\n[Interlude: Kristen Bell]\nI can't wait to meet everyone!\nWhat if I meet \"the one\"?\n\n[Verse 2: Kristen Bell]\nTonight, imagine me, gown and all\nFetchingly draped against the wall\nThe picture of sophisticated grace\nOoh, I suddenly see him standing there\nA beautiful stranger, tall and fair\nI wanna stuff some chocolate in my face\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kristen Bell]\nBut then we laugh and talk all evening\nWhich is totally bizarre\nNothing like the life I've led so far\nYou might also like[Chorus: Kristen Bell]\nFor the first time in forever\nThere'll be magic, there'll be fun\nFor the first time in forever\nI could be noticed by someone\nAnd I know it is totally crazy\nTo dream I'd find romance\nBut for the first time in forever\nAt least I've got a chance\n\n[Bridge: Idina Menzel & Kristen Bell]\nDon't let them in, don't let them see\nBe the good girl you always have to be\nConceal, don't feel\nPut on a show\nMake one wrong move and everyone will know\nBut it's only for today (It's only for today)\nIt's agony to wait (It's agony to wait)\nTell the guards to open up the gate (The gate)\n\n[Chorus: Kristen Bell & Idina Menzel]\nFor the first time in forever\n(Don't let them in, don't let them see)\nI'm getting what I'm dreaming of\n(Be the good girl you always have to be)\nA chance to change my lonely world (Conceal)\nA chance to find true love\n(Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know)\nI know it all ends tomorrow, so it has to be today\n'Cause for the first time in forever\nFor the first time in forever\nNothing's in my way!38Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/391023", "artist_names": "Dierks Bentley", "full_title": "I Hold On by\u00a0Dierks\u00a0Bentley",

here and now he\u2019s gone\nSo I hold on\n[Verse 2]\nIt's just an old beat up box\nIts rusty strings across the top\nIt probably don\u2019t look like much to you\nBut these dents and scratches in the wood\nYeah, that\u2019s what makes it sound so good\nTo me it's better than brand new\nYou see this here flat top guitar\nHas had my back in a million bars\nSinging every country song\nSo I hold on\n\n[Chorus]\nTo the things I believe in\nMy faith, your love, our freedom\nTo the things I can count on\nTo keep me going strong\nYeah, I hold on, I hold on\nLike the stripes to the flag\nLike a boy to his dad\nI can't change who I am, right or wrong\nSo I hold on\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, baby, looking at you right now\nThere ain't never been no doubt\nWithout you I'd be nothing\nSo if you ever worry about\nMe walking out\nYeah, let me tell you something\nI hold on\nI hold on\nCan you hear me, baby?\nI hold on\nYeah\nI hold on\u2026\nSee Dierks Bentley LiveGet tickets as low as $635You might

right like that\nThat lalalala, make your eyes roll back\nI mean you already fine though\nI just wanna see you with the lights off\nEvery guy wanna know how it is\nTo clap off the lights and turn

I've always been wide open, like a window or an ocean\nThere is nothing I've ever tried to hide\nSo when you leave me not knowing where you're going\nI start thinking that we're looking, we're looking at goodbye\nHow about a strong shot of honesty?\nDon't you owe that to me?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose\nIf I'm not that arrow to the heart of you\nIf you don't get

can\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nInto a place where thoughts can bloom\nInto a room where it's nine in the afternoon\nAnd we know that it could be\nAnd we know that it should\nAnd you know that you feel it

everything I do\nIs affecting the people around me\nSo I wanted to take this time out\nTo apologize for things that I've done\nAnd things that haven't occured yet\nAnd things that they don't want to take responsibility for\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm sorry for the times that I left you home\nI was on the road and you were alone\nI'm sorry for the times that I had to go\nI'm sorry for the fact that I did not know\nThat you were sitting home, just wishing we\nCould go back to when it was just you and me\nI'm sorry for the times I would neglect\nI'm sorry for the times I disrespect\nI'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done\nI'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons\nI'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware\nThat you can't sleep at night when I am not there\nBecause I'm in the streets like every day\nI'm sorry for the things that I did not say\nLike how you are the best thing in my world\nAnd how I'm so proud to call you my girl\n[Chorus]\nI understand that there's some problems and I'm not too blind to know\nAll the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show\nIf I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me\nI'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me\nSaid you could put the blame on me\nSaid you could put the blame on me\nSaid you could put the blame on me\nYou could put the blame on me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm sorry for the things that he put you through\nAnd all the times you didn't know what to do\nI'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags\nJust tryin' to stay busy 'til you heard from Dad\nWhen you would rather be home with all your kids\nAs one big family with love and bliss\nAnd even though pops treated us like kings\nHe got a second wife and you didn't agree\nHe got up and left you there all alone\nI'm sorry that you had to do it on your own\nI'm sorry that I went and added to your grief\nI'm sorry that your son was once a thief\nI'm sorry that I grew up way too fast\nI wish I would've listened and not be so bad\nI'm sorry that your life turned out this way\nI'm sorry that the feds came and took me away\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI understand that there are some problems and I'm not too blind to know\nAll the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show\nIf I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me\nI'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me\nSaid you could put the blame on me\nSaid you could put the blame on me (Oh yeah)\nSaid you could put the blame on me\nYou could put the blame on me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm sorry that it took so long to see\nThat they were dead wrong tryna put it on me\nI'm sorry that it took so long to speak\nBut I was on tour with Gwen Stefani\nI'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt\nFor the embarrassment that she felt\nJust a little young girl tryin' to have fun\nHer daddy should've never let her out that young\nI'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down\nI hope they manage better next time around\nHow was I to know she was underage?\nIn a 21-and-older club they say\nWhy doesn't anybody wanna take blame?\nVerizon backed out, disgracing my name\nI'm just a singer tryin' to entertain\nBecause I love my fans I'll take that blame\n[Outro]\nEven though the blame's on you\nEven though the blame's on you\nEven though the blame's on you\nI'll take that blame from you\nAnd you can put that blame on me (On me)\nAnd you can put that blame on me\nYou can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)\nAnd you can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)\nAnd you can put that blame on

second\nMan, it's so hard not to act reckless\nTo whom much is given, much is tested\nGet arrested, guess until he get the message\nI feel the pressure, under more scrutiny\nAnd what I do? Act more stupidly\nBought more jewelry, more Louis V\nMy mama couldn't get through to me\nThe drama, people suing me\nI'm on TV talking like it's just you and me\nI'm just saying how I feel, man\nI ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman\nI guess the money should've changed him\nI guess I should've forgot where I came from\n[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]\nLa, la, la la (Ayy!)\nWait 'til I get my money right\nLa, la, la la (Yeah!)\nThen you can't tell me nothing, right?\nExcuse me, was you saying something?\nUh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (Yeah! Haha!)\nYou can't tell me nothing (Yeah! Yeah!)\nUh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (Yeah!)\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nLet up the suicide doors\nThis is my life, homie, you decide yours\nI know that Jesus died for us\nBut I couldn't tell ya who decide wars\nSo I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways\nOld folks talking 'bout, \"Back in my day\"\nBut homie, this is my day\nClass started two hours ago, oh, am I late?\nNo, I already graduated\nAnd you can live through anything if Magic made it\nThey say I talk with so much emphasis\nOoh, they so sensitive\nDon't ever fix your lips like collagen\nAnd say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing\nLet me know if it's a problem then\nAight, man, holla, then\nYou might also like[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]\nLa, la, la la\nWait 'til I get my money right\nLa, la, la la

West]\nLet the champagne splash, let that man get cash\nLet that man get past\nHe don't even stop to get gas\nIf he can move through the rumors\nHe can drive off of fumes 'cause\nHow he move in a room full of no's?\nHow he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?\nMust be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul\nSo when he buried in a tomb full of gold\nTreasure, what's your pleasure?\nLife is a\u2013uh\u2013depending how you dress her\nSo if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada\nI'm in between, but way more fresher\nWith way less effort\n'Cause when you try hard, that's when you die hard\nYour homies looking like, \"Why, God?\"\nWhen they reminisce over you, my God\n[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]\nLa, la, la la\nWait 'til I get my money right\nLa, la, la la\nThen you can't

said, give it away\nAnd that big four-poster king-size bed\nWhere so much love was made\nJust give it away\nShe said, just give it away\n[Chorus]\nJust give it away\nThere ain't nothing in this house

sports cars\nTo check the license plates\nAnd back wood drivin' by your place\nBack makin' the rounds at our old haunts\nHonky Tonks, restaurants\nAnd seein' some of our old friends\nIt feels good to dance again\nAnd I can finally smell your perfume\nAnd not look around the room for you\nAnd I can walk right by your picture in a frame\nAnd not feel a thing, but when I hear your name\n[Chorus]\nI feel rain falling right out of the blue sky\nAnd it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes\nAnd nothing's change and we're still the same\nAnd I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss\nAnd I'm hanging onto every word running off of your lips\nAnd that's all it takes and I'm in that place\nEvery time I hear your name\n\n[Verse 2]\nGot someone special in my life\nEveryone thinks she'd make a great wife\nDad says he thinks she's the one\nReminds him of Mom when she was young\nBut it's way too soon to be talking 'bout rings\nDon't wanna rush into anything\nShe's getting over someone too\nDinda like me and you\nAnd she talks about him every once in a while\nAnd I just nod my head an' smile\n'Cause I know exactly what she's goin' through\nYeah, I've been there too\nAnd when the conversation turns to you\n\n[Chorus]\nI get caught in a \"you were the only one for me\"\nKinda thought, and your face is all that I see\nI know I can't go back when I still go back\nAnd there we are, a point down by the riverside\nAnd I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time\nAnd that's all it takes, and I'm in that place\nEvery time I hear your name\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nSo I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I left unsaid\n(Every time I hear your name)\nStop tryin' to change the things I can't change\n(Every time I hear your name)\nIn my heart, I know you're gone, but in my head\n\n[Chorus]\nI feel rain falling right out of the blue sky\nAnd it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes\nThat's all it takes and I'm in that place\nAnd
