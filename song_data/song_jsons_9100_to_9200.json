scent, you can just follow my smile\nAll of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine\nCutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind\nYou ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon\nI didn't come for a fight but I will fight 'til the end\nThis one might be a battle, might not turn out okay\nYou know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I love the way you hurt me\nIt's irresistible, oh yeah\nI love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)\nI love the way you hurt me, baby\nI love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)\nI love the way you hurt me, baby\n[Verse 2]\nI'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble\nFrame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble\nLike a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation\nTruly free, love it, baby, I'm talking no inflation\nToo many war wounds and not enough wars\nToo few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores\nToo many sharks, not enough blood in the waves\nYou know I give my love a f-f-four letter name\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I love the way you hurt me\nIt's irresistible, oh yeah\nI love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)\nI love the way you hurt me, baby\nI love the way

ch\u00e9ri\nBut the truth catches up with us eventually\nTry to say live, live and let live\nBut I'm no good, good at lip service\nExcept when they're yours, mi amor\nI'm coming for you and I'm making war\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd I still love the way you hurt me\nIt's irresistible, oh yeah\nI love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)\nI love the way you hurt me, baby\nI love the way

In The Gun Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThey used to call me lightning\nI was always quick to strike\nHad everything I own\nIn the saddles on my bike\nI had a reputation\nFor never staying very long\nJust like a wild and restless drifter\nLike a cowboy in a song\n\n[Verse 2]\nI met a dark haired beauty\nWhere they lay the whiskey down\nIn southern Arizona\nIn a little border town\nShe had to dance for money\nIn that dusty old saloon\nI dropped a dollar in the jukebox\nPlayed that girl a tune, yea\n[Chorus]\nNever see it coming\nIt just hits you by surprise\nIt's that cold place in your soul\nThat fire in her eyes\nMakes you come together\nLike wild horses when they run\nNow the cards are on the table and\nThe bullets in the gun\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe was sitting on my lap\nWe still had shots to kill\nWhen a man pulled up\nWho owned the bar\nIn a Cadillac DeVille\nHe grabbed her by her raven hair\nAnd threw her on the floor\nSaid no free rides for the cowboys\nThat ain't what I pay you for, no\n\n[Verse 4]\nShe jumped up and grabbed my pistol\nStuck it in the fat man's back\nSaid open up the safe\nAnd put your money in the sack\nThen tied his hands behind him\nAnd put a blindfold on his eyes\nSaid if you're dumb enough to chase us, man\nYou're dumb enough to die\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nNever see it coming\nIt just hits you by surprise\nIt's that cold place in your soul\nThat fire in her eyes\nMakes you come together\nLike wild horses when they run\nNow the cards are on the table and\nThe bullets in the gun, yeah\n\n[Verse 5]\nWe rode across the border\nDown into Mexico\nWhen you're running from the law\nAin't that where everybody goes\nWe came to a town\nWith a name I could not spell\nShe gave me what I came for\nIn that Mexican motel\n\n[Verse 6]\nI woke up to sirens\nAnd the sound of running feet\nThere were fifty Federales\nLocked and loaded in the street\nShe grabbed my .44\nI grabbed the money in the sack\nShe kissed me for the last time\nAnd we headed out the back\n[Bridge]\nEvery gun was on us\nAnd every heartbeat pounded\nThere's only one thing left to do\nWhen they got you all surrounded\nShe fired that old pistol\nBut we didn't stand a prayer\nMoney hit the gravel\nBullets filled the air\n\n[Chorus]\nNever see it coming\nIt just hits you by surprise\nIt's that cold place in your soul\nThat fire in her eyes\nMakes you come together\nLike wild horses when they run\nNow the cards are on the table and\nThe bullets in the gun\nBullets in the gun\nBullets in the gun\nBullets in the gunEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

out Hank and AC/DC\n\nAt the bonfire, out in the sticks\nCountry backwoods, homegrown hicks\nBonfire, dance a little jig\nHold up your cup and take another swig\nWon't sleep til dawn, party right down to the wire\nAt the bonfire\nEverybody sees the headlights\nWhen old Sheriff John pulled up\nWe all got a little nervous\nIt's too late to hide our cups\nHe pops a top and hollers real loud\nDont worry yall i came to hang out\n\nAt the bonfire, out in the sticks\nCountry backwoods, homegrown hicks\nBonfire, dance a little jig\nHold up your cup and take another swig\nWon't sleep til dawn, party right down to the wire\nAt the bonfire\n\nYou dont have to be from around here\nTo know right where to go\nAll you gotta do is load up\nAnd head towards glow\n\nAt the bonfire, out in the sticks\nCountry backwoods, homegrown hicks\nBonfire, dance a little jig\nHold up your cup and take another swig\nWon't sleep til dawn, party right down to the wire\nAt the bonfire\nYou might also

not seeing that loving you\nIs what I was trying to do\n[Verse 2]\nIt's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go\nBut I'm doin' it\nIt's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone\nStill harder getting up, getting dressed, living with this regret\nBut I know if I could do it over\nI would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart\nThat I left unspoken\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat hurts the most was being so close\nAnd having so much to say (Much to say)\nAnd watching you walk away (Walk away)\nNever knowing what could have been\nAnd not seeing that

funds\nAll I seen is the struggle, it's like I'm trapped in the slums\nWorkers were barely paid, no water, we barely bathe\nThere better be better days on the way that's on my daddy grave\nI'm pushin' it hard, I'm pushin' it soft\nIf he pushin' a line, he pushin' for Ross\nI waited and waited, I done ran out of patience\nThey hated and hated, left him slow dancin' with Satan\nFresh in my white tee, Mac-11, swear to God\nI bought my first block, broke it down and tore the block apart\n[Hook]\nI push and I push, I ride and I ride\nTryna survive on 95\nPut it all on the line every drop of a dime\nI be pushin' them whips, yep, three at time\nI'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it\nI'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)\nII'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it\nI'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI handle dope like a vandal off the banana boat\nBananas in our rifles, no cyphers, I'm just the man to know\nI paid dues, my moves done made news\nI'm smooth, my suede shoes they new like Ray shoes\nNobody used to speak, now e'rybody wave\nYou duck your momma house, you set your sister straight\nI'm buildin' a dream, with elevators in it\nTailor made the linen, no gators got on my hater-vision\nI see ya, I see ya suckers, I see ya clear\nI know you see me in that Phantom whiter than veneers\nAllergic to broke, determined to blow\nOn the boat we hid the work in detergent and soap\nWe ship it from Haiti, baby I'm whippin' them babies\nLet it dry, let it dry, try to whip a Mercedes\nArrangin' my Range, here to rain ya parade\nYou gotta push it to the limit you wanna be paid\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI push and I push, I ride and I ride\nTryna survive on 95 (Push it to the limit)\nPut it all on the line every drop of a dime\nI be pushin' them whips, yep, three at

the money matured\nMy money's secured, I got bundles in Europe\nMy bubble be pure, it cost like a hundred a pull\nThe world is yours, hundred million or more\nNow I run the streets, they all mine\n12 years overdue, call it due time\nI told you never roll on the soul of a soldier\nYou never know that dishwasher may be the beholder\nWhoever thought that fat girl would grow into Oprah\nOr that boy Rick Ross would be moldin' the culture\nI push and push, we breakin' the mold\nWe push and we push, we rake in the hold\n\n[Hook]\nI push and I push, I ride and I ride\nTryna survive on 95 (Push it to

back\n(Snap, snap, snap, snap)\nAnd never seen a girl like that\nNow it's clear to me that you're that girl for me\n(Snap, snap, snap, snap)\n[Verse 4: Chamillionaire]\nAnd then she looks at me\nAnd then she says \"if I ever had breakfast in bed\"\nThen I say \"I'd rather have breakfast in Brazil instead\"\nThen she says \"Stop playing, why you're messing with my head?\"\nThen I say \"I'm not playing, I got a jet and we can check it\"\nYes, I had you try find an energizer battery\nKeep gone, she know she'll be sweating, loosing calories\nYou can be the best \"B\", I bet you couldn't handle me\nWith money on the bed and I can prove it on my salary\n\n[Chorus: Frankie J & Mannie Fresh]\nShe got a bill and a face like a supermodel\nAnd a body built just like a coke bottle\nBut none can

hold up\nSlow, slow down\nListen, give me 10 minutes\nWell, give me 5 minutes...a'ight\nB-before you leave I just need these last 4 minutes\n\n[Verse 1]\nPardon me if I'm talking fast and stumbling all over my words\nI heard you were leavin' town\nI thought I'd be the one to know first\nIf you have a minute let me talk to you and see what's going on\nDon't say it's nothing\nWhen it's gotta be something that's gone wrong\nNow let me explain but I don't know what to say\n'Cause I don't know what the hell happened\nI come in the house to try to work it out\nAnd all you're doing is packing\nClose your suitcase let me think straight\nDamn, what could be the reason\nBaby talk to me I'm almost out of time\n[Chorus]\nI only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do\nTo prove to you that I'm gon' do anything\nOnly got 4 minutes say what I gotta say to make you stay\nAnd show you that I done changed\n'Cause in 4 minutes\nI'll never have my girl again\nIn 4 minutes\nI'm a lose her to some other man\n4 no less no more\nI'm desperate cause the clock's ticking\nOnly got 4 minutes to go\n\n[Verse 2]\nWho are these people I don't know in my house?\nAnd they scratching my floors\nTakin' furniture outside and the U-Haul pull up to my door\nWhat's the reason that I get this feelin'\nThat you can't keep it real with me?\nIs it cause of the prior relationships I had off in the streets?\nNever mind that this is your conscience speaking\nAnd you need to get your girl back\nYou gotta find a way to try to get to her heart\nI'm takin' suggestions I've learned my lesson\nThink conscience you're my last lifeline\nI'm down to my last second\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do\nTo prove to you that I'm gon' do anything\nOnly got 4 minutes say what I gotta say to make you stay\nAnd show you that I done changed\n'Cause in 4 minutes\nI'll never have my girl again\nIn 4 minutes\nI'm a lose her to some other man\n4 no less no more\nI'm desperate cause the clock's ticking\nOnly got 4 minutes to go\n\n[Bridge]\nI've done things in my past\nI thought this love would last\nBut I can't let you go baby\nYou're my everything lady\nThe reason I smile and the reason I talk baby\nThe reason I breathe\nThe only one for me, yeah\nYou can't go through with this\nIf you left me my life wouldn't exist\nCause I'm still in love with you\nAnd that's my word I don't give a damn what you heard\nOh, baby I'll be true\n[Chorus (variant)]\nI only got 4 minutes\nAnd I'm running out of time\nI only got 4 minutes\nI only got 4 minutes\n4 minutes I'll never have my girl again\nIn 4 minutes I'm a lose her to some other man\n4 no less no more\nCause the clocks ticking\nOnly got 4 minutes to go\n\n[Outro]\nOnly got 4 minutes to tell you everything I love about you\n4 minutes to say I need you, I can't live without you\nI'm out of time gotta say what's on my mind\nJust to keep you in my life\nAw, damn I'm outta time3Embed"}, {"_type":

Crown Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou're all that I have and you're all that I need\nEach and every day I pray to get to know you, please\nI want to be close to you, yes I'm so hungry\nYou're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty\nWithout you there's no me\nYou're the air that I breathe\nSometimes the world is dark and I just can't see\nWith these, demons surround all around to bring me down to negativity\nBut I believe, yes I believe, I said I believe\nI'll stand on my own two feet\nWon't be brought down on one knee\nFight with all of my might and get these demons to flee\nHaShem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe\nHaShem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe\nOut of darkness comes light, twilight unto the heights\nCrown Heights burnin' up all through till twilight\nSaid thank you to my God, now I finally got it right\nAnd I'll fight with all of my heart, and all a' my soul, and all a' my might\n[Hook]\nWhat's this feeling?\nMy love will rip a hole in the ceiling\nI give myself to you from the essence of my being and I\nSing to my god, songs of love and healing\nI want Moshiach now, time we start revealing\nWhat's this feeling?\nMy love will rip a hole in the ceiling\nI give myself to you from the essence of my being and I\nSing to my god, songs of love and healing\nI want Moshiach now\n\n[Verse 2]\nStrippin\u2019 away the layers and reveal your soul\nGot to give yourself up and then you become whole\nYou're a slave to yourself and you don't even know\nYou want to live the fast life but your brain moves slow\nIf you're trying to stay high, bound to stay low\nYou want God but you can't deflate your ego\nIf you're already there then there's nowhere to go\nIf your cup's already full then its bound to overflow\nIf you're drowning in the waters and you can't stay afloat\nAsk Hashem for mercy, and he'll throw you a rope\nYou're looking for help from God you say he couldn't be found\nSearching up to the sky and looking beneath the ground\nLike a King without his Crown\nYou keep fallin' down\nYou really want to live but can't get rid of your frown\nTried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down on the ground\nGiven up your pride and then you heard a sound\nOut of night comes day and out of day comes light\nNullified to the One like sunlight in a ray\nMakin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze\nMakin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nSee I lift up my eyes where my help come from\nAnd I seen it circling around from the mountain\nThunder!\nYou feel it in your chest\nYou keep my mind at ease and my soul at rest\nYou're not vexed\nLook to the sky where my help come from\nSeen it circling around from the mountain\nThunder!\nYou feel it in your chest\nYou keep my mind at ease and my soul at rest\nYou're not vexed12Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1462418", "artist_names": "Chris Cagle", "full_title": "Miss Me Baby

never pictured every minute without you in it\nOh, you left so fast\nSometimes I see you standing there\nSometimes it's like I'm losing touch\nSometimes I feel that I'm so lucky\nTo have had the chance to love this much\nGod gave me a moment's grace\n'Cause if I'd never seen your face\nI probably wouldn't be this way\n\n[Verse 2]\nMama says that I just shouldn't speak to you\nSusan says that I should just move on\nYou oughta see the way these people look at me\nWhen they see me 'round here talking to this stone\nEverybody thinks I've lost my mind\nBut I just take it day by day\n\n[Chorus]\nI probably wouldn't be this way\nI probably wouldn't hurt so bad\nI never pictured every minute without you in it\nOh, you left so fast\nSometimes I see you standing there\nSometimes it's like I'm losing touch\nSometimes I feel that I'm so lucky\nTo have had the chance to love this much\nGod gave me a moment's grace\nCause if I'd never seen your face\nI probably wouldn't be this way\nProbably wouldn't be this way\nYou might also like[Outro]\nGot a date a week from Friday\nWith the preacher's son\nEverybody says I'm crazy\nGuess I'll have to seeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

them summer nights\nKeep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot\nHit the bolo and we just don't stop\nParty until the mornin' light (Woah)\nAin't nothin' like them summer nights\n[Verse 1]\nI just kicked it at home, I polished up the chrome\nCalled the ruca on the phone, let her know I'm home alone\nIt's 7:30 and the sun's goin' down\nIt's a summer night and the fun's goin' down\nI pick her up and she looks all dolled up (She look good)\nSittin' passenger in my rag Impala (Yeah)\nI let her know that she looks beautiful to me\nThe world's an ugly place, but she is such a sight to see\nThe kind of woman that would put up a fight for me\nThe kind that wants to spend her summer nights with me\nThe temp was eighty and I'm cruisin' with my lady\nPlayin' some Ralfi Pagan, ooh, baby, baby\nI see my homeboys and they're cruisin' in their ride (Hey, wassup holmes?)\nWith their ladies sittin' by their side\nPeople think we look crazy, but I think we look classy\nBut then again, that's only if you ask me\n\n[Chorus]\n(Woah) Summer days just sittin' around\nBut when the sun goes down\nI'll be ready to party (Woah, hey)\nAin't nothin' like them summer nights\nKeep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot\nHit the bolo and we just don't stop\nParty until the mornin' light (Woah)\nAin't nothin' like them summer nights\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nMy homeboys throwin' a backyard boogie, so everybody\nGets together to unwind, relax and have a fun time\nThe DJ's spinnin', so I grab the mic and be like\n\"Ain't nothin' like them summer nights\"\nThe party's packed with beautiful women\nAnd the gang of the homies that wanna get with 'em\nAnd they'll say anything just to hit 'em\nAnd it's usually a nice summer night when they did 'em\nI don't know, it must be something in the air\nCan't help but have a good time because the feelin' is there\nTo some people, the feelin' is rare\nThey're at the pad sayin', \"God damn, I wish I was there\"\nTo have a drink, have a toke and hook up\nWith someone fine, but the kind that looks up\nGotta keep some pisto in the cup\nParty until the sun comes up or we give up\n\n[Chorus]\n(Woah) Summer days just sittin' around\nBut when the sun goes down\nI'll be ready to party (Woah, hey)\nAin't nothin' like them summer nights\nKeep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot\nHit the bolo and we just don't stop\nParty until the mornin' light (Woah)\nAin't nothin' like them summer nights\n[Verse 3]\nThem summer nights can keep a smile on your face\nGotta try to have a good time with this life, otherwise it's just a waste\nEither way, I'm gonna party just in case\nLike Prince partied like it was '99 in '87, '88\nI couldn't ask for no better weather\nI'm right next to the Pacific, to be specific\nThe candy paint job glows under the moonlight\nAs I close out my summer night and say goodnight\nIt's time to put the top up and park it\nDrop it, unplug the ground, roll up the windows and lock it\nWalk in the pad and fall into bed\nAs she lays on my chest to rest her sleepy head\nAnd we do this all night long, from dusk 'til dawn\nBut it's not quite the same when summer nights are gone\nBut even when they're gone, it won't be long\nEight more months, then once again it's on\n\n[Chorus]\n(Woah) Summer days just sittin' around\nBut when the sun goes down\nI'll be ready to party (Woah, hey)\nAin't nothin' like them summer nights\nKeep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot\nHit the bolo and we just don't stop\nParty until the mornin' light (Woah)\nAin't nothin' like them summer nights\n\n[Outro]\nFingazz on the
